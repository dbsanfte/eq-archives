15.  Aside from Accelerando and SoW, I would say Snare is The<br/>
Most Useful spell in the game at level 9.<br/>

&gt; As far as I have heard it is NEVER suggested that any of these classes stand<br/>

weapons swinging would be just as bad as never singing.<br/>

There are two aspects of combat - offense and defense.  The<br/>
way these two mix is often difficult to understand, which is<br/>
why people always ask whether you should sing Hymn during<br/>
combat, or why the DDD/CoD/Hymn combo works better than<br/>
weapons in some cases but not others.  Better offense kills<br/>
mobs faster (shortens the fight).  Better defense lets you<br/>
survive longer (lengthens the duration you can survive a<br/>
fight).<br/>
<br/>
Not being good at tanking (defense) doesn&#39;t mean you have to<br/>
avoid melee (offense).  You just have to fiddle around with<br/>
your song taunt effects so that the mobs usually end up<br/>
attacking the true tanks.  While our area effect DoTs can do<br/>
better than our weapons in certain situations, most of the<br/>
time our weapons are the best way to contribute to the group<br/>
(with songs sung).  If we get into a situation where more<br/>
defense is required (magic resist, more healing), then I&#39;ll<br/>
switch to instruments and stand back.  If we need to kill a<br/>
mob quick though (e.g. spawn coming up), I&#39;m right in there<br/>
with my blades.<br/>
<br/>
Most classes don&#39;t get this choice.  They just fight and let<br/>
the random number generator determine the outcome.<br/>
