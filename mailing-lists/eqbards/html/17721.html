<div id="ygrps-yiv-636849635">Hi Evulia,<br/>
<br/>
Yes from what I can tell, there will be judges that tell you what your next<br/>
move will be and which opponent you are dueling next. At least I sure hope so!<br/>
We are playing good against evil and the highest level character is the king.<br/>
The king for the good is lvl 46 and the king for the evil is lvl 48. The<br/>
queens are lvl&#39;s 41 mag/33 necro respectively. It should interesting<br/>
especially considering the player that is the 33 necro is a trip! He is SO<br/>
funny!! I&#39;m lined up to fight a lvl 15 mag. Hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be honest I haven&#39;t used Chords of Dissonance to much since I<br/>
kept forgetting that I still had it &quot;active&quot; when I went around the guards. I<br/>
kept ending up looking at the sky, deader than a doornail. But I&#39;ll experiment<br/>
with it in the next couple of days. My instruments are maxed out on practices<br/>
right now though so that&#39;s good. <br/>
<br/>
Talk to ya later!<br/>

&gt; How much damage can you do at level 11 with Chords of Dissonance?  I have<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi fellow bards!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I need some information assistance. We are having an event on <br/>
&gt; &gt; my server,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; chessboard with duels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of <br/>
&gt; &gt; King, Queen,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my <br/>
&gt; &gt; guild has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I <br/>
&gt; &gt; would be asked to<br/>
&gt; &gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been <br/>
&gt; &gt; chosen as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ <br/>
&gt; &gt; to possibly come<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to <br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the rules of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be <br/>
&gt; &gt; allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>
&gt; &gt; allowed. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best <br/>
&gt; &gt; bard that I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of <br/>
&gt; &gt; you......the experts!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
