<div id="ygrps-yiv-807583566">I received an email last night from Manga of the EverQuest Stratics site.<br/>
They are interested in hosting the Song Analysis on their network.  I<br/>
consider the Song Analysis to be not just mine, but all of yours as well. As<br/>
it would not be what it is without the combined wisdom of all the wonderful<br/>
bards on this mailing list and on the Concert Hall message board.  Your<br/>
opinions on this matter mean a lot to me, so please let me know what your<br/>
feelings are.<br/>
