<b>Subject:</b> My opinion on the safest Freeport&lt;-&gt;Qeynos route. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590999286">In my opinion, if you want the absolute safest route, go the Runnyeye <br/>
route. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience in either, but the former is <br/>
definitely as safe as you can get if you&#39;re careful. There&#39;s very little <br/>
chance of getting trained or something spawning right where you&#39;re <br/>
standing. Just remember, in the gorge go CRAZY high up on the wall. You&#39;ll <br/>
be fine, trust me. Be anal about it, take 20 minutes to do it if you <br/>
wish... unless you have extreme bad luck or make an awful mistake you&#39;ll be <br/>
alright.<br/>
Just my opinion. It&#39;s not the fastest or the most convenient way but it&#39;s <br/>
the safest as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Finally used Lament to escape certain death, very fun ;) I was basically <br/>
crawling as a beastie whacked on me. Managed to keep it from getting close <br/>
cuz I lamented it every time it did. Must&#39;ve looked odd to the crowd of <br/>
bemused onlookers. But while I was fumbling in my inventory to equip my <br/>
drum I accidentally dropped a backpack I was carrying full of juicy loot. I <br/>
went back for it, like the fiend that I am - with about 15 hp&#39;s or so (this <br/>
is AFTER I had zoned), but didn&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
So I pulled a MASSIVE PSYCHO TRAAAAAAIN on everyone there out of spite!<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding ;)<br/>

I keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>
I want to go to Qeynos there are two options. Either RunnEye or High<br/>
Hold Pass. I hear in HighHold there are gnolls who will kill me and in<br/>
RunnEye I&#39;ll have 10 creatures trained on me. I don&#39;t like to train, nor<br/>
do I like to die. So please let me know, whats the safest way for a<br/>
level 10 Bard to travel from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
