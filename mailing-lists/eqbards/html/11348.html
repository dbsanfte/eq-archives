There were many times when I faced very frustrating things with songs or<br/>
skills we have for our class, but unlike other classes, what I&#39;ve found<br/>
is with the bard class everything gets better as you level. Songs that<br/>
are totally useless or are too weak at the level you get them can be<br/>
utterly devastating in the 30s and 40s. Also, once you get tracking at<br/>
L35, let me tell you folks, we got the last laugh on any other class.<br/>
Sure it would have been nice to have tracking at a lower level, but in<br/>
the 40-50 range, a bard is powerful enough to solo many rare spawns, and<br/>
you can track them down [fingers her Pegasus Feather Cloak off Quillmane<br/>
;)]!<br/>
<br/>
When I was L8, I was terribly frustrated with being a bard, complete<br/>
with my patchwork leather and storebought shield and storebought<br/>
longsword. I then heard of a new bard mailing list, that gave me alot of<br/>
helpful tips and explained many things I didn&#39;t understand. It explained<br/>
we could twists songs, and how to set up a hot key bank to make<br/>
switching to instrument much more painless. The list was eqbards. ;P<br/>
<br/>
I was off the list for a couple months while moving, sorry to make a<br/>
stir with coming back! However, it&#39;s my goal to help share some of the<br/>
great tricks I&#39;ve learned through my bizarre and amusing travels, just<br/>
as so long ago someone explained how we could play more than 1 song at a<br/>
time. :)<br/>
