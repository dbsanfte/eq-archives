&lt;&lt; I used this song to practice up my brass skill a bit.  I<br/>
 feared a bunch of snakes, skunks, etc. in Butcherblock and set<br/>
 myself on a hill near a goblin camp &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone seems to think that the only way to practice brass is to have <br/>
something being hit by the effect. I know for a fact that this isnt true. I <br/>
set myself up on the side of a mountain in a newbie zone playing DDD for but <br/>
4 hours (this was at 18 when it was the first brass song); I gained almost 60 <br/>
points in that time even though nothing was being targeted.<br/>
