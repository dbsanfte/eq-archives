<div id="ygrps-yiv-791585291">I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby) with pickup groups<br/>
at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they don&#39;t trust my<br/>
lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one nightmarish pull<br/>
(&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of Oasis) in which I died<br/>
because nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the virtual chalkboard<br/>
and went though it step-by-step:<br/>
<br/>
1) I type MEZ<br/>
2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>
3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>
4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound on me between naps<br/>
<br/>
Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>
everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It was<br/>
late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>
situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>
convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out of there if<br/>
I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>
cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>
<br/>
The evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
graduating to more mature groups where satisfaction comes from watching a<br/>
good plan come together, rather than marvelling that we didn&#39;t die when we<br/>
deserved to.<br/>

p.s. Who decided that non-SoW&#39;d trolls make good pullers? The ten minutes<br/>
ours was away selling I pulled and we killed twice as many mobs with little<br/>
downtime.<br/>

&gt; This simple tactic seems to be the hardest think for hybrid tanks to<br/>
learn.<br/>
&gt; I have seen even mid 30&#39;s (typically in HK where it is after all &quot;safe&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have to be really skilled to survive) not follow this really<br/>
&gt; simple yet effective proceedure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It works!  It really, really works!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; and take one at a time..<br/>
