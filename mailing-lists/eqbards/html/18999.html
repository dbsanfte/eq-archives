&gt;Bards get 49 songs at level 50.<br/>
&gt;EVERY pure caster has over 100.<br/>
&gt;Enchanters (having the most) are near 160.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you ever seen a high level caster spell refered to in a patch message<br/>
&gt;as &quot;The high level mez spell&quot;? Maybe upset is the wrong word, but annoyed<br/>
&gt;certainly rings true. They&#39;re writing a patch message. It&#39;s not like someone<br/>
&gt;says to Abashi (or whoever writes these things) &quot;we changed the high level<br/>
&gt;bard song.&quot; He should get a list of changes, or if it happens in a meeting,<br/>
&gt;he should be taking notes. Secondly, it was a four hour patch, he could have<br/>
&gt;looked up the name of the song in 35 seconds. I just find it somewhat<br/>
&gt;insulting that they can look up the name of 15 spells for casters to say<br/>
&gt;they adjusted the recast time or whatever, then they refer to our song as<br/>
&gt;&quot;The higher level bard song by Brusco&quot;. Maybe I could understand it if this<br/>
&gt;song were quested or a drop off a mob, but it&#39;s sold at the vendor, so<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s no need for mystery.<br/>

at this company.<br/>
