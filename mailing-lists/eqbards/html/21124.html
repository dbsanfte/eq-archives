<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;d strongly recommend Soinachie&#39;s Partisan, which is Damage 9, Delay <br/>
19, +6 CHA, +2 INT, SV Magic +5, and weighs in very light at 1.8.   It drops <br/>
in Karnor&#39;s Castle and is Bard only.  It is LORE unfortunately so you can&#39;t <br/>
dual-weild two of them, but it can be weilded in either hand.   I&#39;m <br/>
currently using one of these in my primary hand and a Yak in my off hand.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the Staff of Writhing is primary hand only.<br/>
<br/>
Guess you&#39;re a battle bard too... hehe<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;Well its time for me to call upon the experinced souls here to get some <br/>
&gt;advice<br/>
&gt;regarding weapons. I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>
&gt;- Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic prot. <br/>
&gt;  Wt.<br/>
&gt;3.5.<br/>
&gt;- Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of <br/>
&gt;Ykesha<br/>
&gt;(75 point direct damage spell)<br/>
&gt;- Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>
&gt;- Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>
&gt;- Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>
&gt;Currently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is <br/>
&gt;better<br/>
&gt;than with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my doubts. <br/>
&gt;Im<br/>
&gt;not satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>
&gt;suggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>
&gt;I have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is <br/>
&gt;resisted<br/>
&gt;quite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>
