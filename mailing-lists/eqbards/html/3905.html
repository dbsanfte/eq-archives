 </span></blockquote>Snow does slow you down noticably. Ice however is just like snow. After<br/>
spending the last few days in Everfrost I really think somewhat slippery ice<br/>
would be a *good* thing, obnoxious yes, but would add challenge to the area.<br/>
BTW, while there I did a corpse retreive for a guy that, while fighting a<br/>
Shaman first fell into a hole inthe ice and THEN got rooted...man that has<br/>
to suck...I was glad to see Selos still breaks root, every time the Snow Orc<br/>
shaman cast root I was thinking &quot;that&#39;s it big boy, spend all that mana on<br/>
root...&quot; *laughs*<br/>
