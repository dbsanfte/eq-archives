because a ranger is better at melee and thus theoretically could have<br/>
made use of the mistwalker more than a druid, yet the staff (forbidden<br/>
rites I assume) is also a pretty kick butt melee weapon and just as<br/>
useless in the hands of a cleric as the mistwalker would be in the hands<br/>
of a druid.<br/>
<br/>
This is also the same kind of attitude that was used to keep Bards out<br/>
of the early lottos for Ykeshas on my server and it still pisses me off.<br/>
