&gt; &gt; One thing that I would like added for bards, but I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt; if other&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; would want it, is a button we could toggle between &#39;Group&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and &#39;All&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would have to agree with you. It always seemed silly to me that only<br/>
&gt;people in my group were able to hear my songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But.. on the other hand, if the songs affect everyone that can hear them,<br/>
&gt;then they would logically affect the mobs you&#39;re fighting as well. And <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;of all the complaining that would arrise from Bards being able to<br/>
&gt;mana-lessly heal and buff other players just by standing next to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a short time in beta this was the case.  It was great when I would come <br/>
upon a party in trouble I could buff/heal them with ease.  Also people would <br/>
always be hitching a ride on the Selo Train as I would cross the Karanas.  I <br/>
was saddened when they took this out.<br/>
