&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, what <br/>
&gt;changes would need to be made to make it worth memming in place of <br/>
&gt;some other song?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>by the way, what would be the reasoning behind giving us more power with this<br/>
song?  how would it help balance the classes as a whole by giving us more damage?<br/>
shada i believe said we are already balanced or even overpowered in the non uber raid<br/>
arena.  how would this not make us overpowered or overpower us even more in this<br/>
area?  how would this even help us in the uber raid area since most nonlure type<br/>
damage spells are heavily resisted anyway?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now that would make it useless to me, heh, since generally i don&#39;t have a song slot<br/>
i can dedicate to it.  however, i *can* make room for about 10 seconds every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Increase the damage?  What damage would be sufficient to make it <br/>
&gt;worth memming?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>considering that now you can mem it for 10 seconds whenever you want and then<br/>
get rid of it, i would think any damage would be nice since it&#39;s essentially free.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Make it DD rather than AE? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we already have a targetted DD song at 55 (and 12 i guess heh).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well you answered your own previous question i guess heh.<br/>
