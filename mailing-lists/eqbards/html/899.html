<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbard] A Bard&#39;s usefulness after lvl 12 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-714219670">The only thing I can really say is that groups who have an opening and<br/>
don&#39;t want a bard just don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.  I&#39;ll be the first<br/>
to admit that a bard isn&#39;t as good at soloing as many other classes, but<br/>
there are few if any classes who can add as much to a group as a bard<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if you look at a group in terms of one battle only many if not ALL<br/>
classes will contribute more than a bard.  Will a group do more damage<br/>
in a battle if the last person added to the group is a bard, or a<br/>
warrior?  Or a wizard?  Will the group heal faster if the last person is<br/>
a druid or a bard?  Or a cleric or a bard?<br/>
<br/>
But looking at things these ways are shortsighted.  Bards cut a groups<br/>
downtime by a HUGE factor, and less downtime means more kills per hour,<br/>
and that&#39;s what matters to powergamers.  Bards also cut travel time. <br/>
Bards let a group bust camps.  I know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the<br/>
choir here, but these are the sorts of things you should tell those<br/>
*ahem* stupid group leaders out there who don&#39;t want a bard.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell them that having you in the party compared to another wizard or<br/>
another tank will mean they&#39;ll get 20% more experience at the end of the<br/>
night.  Now if their wizards blow all their mana every fight, having a<br/>
bard there isn&#39;t going to speed things up unless you&#39;re level 32, but<br/>
you get the principle.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget, there are plenty of group leaders out there who are<br/>
just plain dumb.  You don&#39;t want to be in their groups anyway. :)<br/>
