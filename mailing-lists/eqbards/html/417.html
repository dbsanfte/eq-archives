 </span></blockquote>Hi Here is list of all the Bard things I have put together including Songs<br/>
and What Instrament to use, what they do and Where to get them including<br/>
names of cities. I can send this in a TxT form but if you are like me I do<br/>
not normally Accept File attachments due to high number of Vireses and Word<br/>
Doc Macro Vireses. Just Copy everything here to a Bard.txt or Bard.doc file<br/>
and youll have it with you always. I am always putting together more so if<br/>
you have something here I don&#39;t please tell me so I can add it.<br/>

<br/>
Bard Song List and Where to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Spell Descriptions<br/>
<br/>
Level 1 - Chant of Battle<br/>
This will boost the parties AC, STR and DEX by a small ammount. It&#39;s not<br/>
very powerful but it does help a little<br/>
<br/>
Level 2 - Chords of Dissonance<br/>
This spell does a small ammount of damage with an area effect. This spell<br/>
takes a long time just to get a regular rat to half it&#39;s health but if<br/>
you&#39;re fighting several targets at once then the difference can be<br/>
noticeable. Be very careful using it around any npc&#39;s such as the guards<br/>
since it will hurt them also<br/>
<br/>
Level 3 - Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>
This will decrease the fatigue of the party by a small ammount.  Great when<br/>
swimming.<br/>
<br/>
Level 4 - Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric<br/>
Click on the person whos corpse you want to find, cast this spell and it<br/>
will constantly update your heading so you&#39;re pointing at the corpse. The<br/>
corpse must be in the same zone as you. This spell works very well and it<br/>
will definitely come in handy now and then.<br/>
<br/>
Level 5 - Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
Cast this spell and you will be able to out run almost anything, use it with<br/>
a drum and you will. This is one of the bard&#39;s best spells.<br/>
<br/>
Level 6 - Hymn of Restoration<br/>
This is the first really useful spell for combat. It will constantly heal<br/>
the party by 3 points every tick (5 seconds), 6 points with a stringed<br/>
instrument and plus the 1 point you usually get that&#39;s 7 points a tick. Plus<br/>
another if you&#39;re sitting down. I believe this spell does an extra 2 points<br/>
of healing for every 6 levels you gain over level 6<br/>
<br/>
Level 7 - Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>
This only works on yourself and it will increase your STR, AC and attack<br/>
speed. I find that Hymn is better unless you&#39;re attacking something that<br/>
can&#39;t hurt you anyways this will let you kill it a little faster<br/>
<br/>
Level 8 - Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament<br/>
This will only work on a single target at a time but if you have two<br/>
monsters standing beside each other and you know you can only handle one at<br/>
a time you can cast it on a one of them and lead the other away without the<br/>
first one attacking you. I&#39;ve been told that if you time it right you can<br/>
work the effect on not only 1 but also 2 targets at a time which would come<br/>
in handy if you wanted to attack a camp. This spell can be very useful if<br/>
you learn to use it wisely<br/>
<br/>
Level 9 - Elemental Rhythms<br/>
This will increase your fire, cold and magic resistances each one by 15 and<br/>
27 if you&#39;re using a drum with it. If your party is going to get blasted<br/>
with magic attacks from something like an evil eye and your extra attack<br/>
power won&#39;t be missed too sorely equip a drum and this spell can be a big<br/>
help<br/>
<br/>
Level 10 - Anthem de Arms<br/>
This will increase the attack speed and strength of the party. Hymn is often<br/>
a better spell to use but if you have 2 bards in a group, a lot of hitters<br/>
or you&#39;re just not taking much damage then this spell can be very useful.<br/>
One trick is if you alternate between this and hymn with the right timing<br/>
you and get the benefits of both spells<br/>
<br/>
Level 11 - Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon<br/>
This spell apparently increases your faction with an NPC, I&#39;ve tested it out<br/>
many times and haven&#39;t been able to observe strong results so far...<br/>
<br/>
Level 12 - Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow<br/>
Bellow is another spell you&#39;ll find yourself using all the time. Target a<br/>
monster cast the spell and it starts off doing about a maximum of 7 points<br/>
of damage which doesn&#39;t sound like much but it never misses and it often<br/>
does full damage. I believe it does an extra point of damage every 2 levels<br/>
above 12. After you hit the monster you will see a message saying &#39;monster<br/>
was hit by non mele damage&#39; or something like that, hit the spell button<br/>
again really quickly to stop casting and hit it again to recast it. When you<br/>
get the timing right you can cast it just as fast as swinging a longsword.<br/>
This is also the first spell a bard gets that&#39;s useful for drawing monsters<br/>
at a distance<br/>
<br/>
Level 13 - Purifying Rythms<br/>
This will increase your party&#39;s resistance against poison, magic and disease<br/>
each by 15 and 27 if you&#39;re using a drum. This spell is just like the level<br/>
9 spell except it effects more commonly dealt with attacks<br/>
Level 14 - Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto<br/>
Cast this spell and click an item like a ring on your person and it will<br/>
tell you something about it.<br/>
<br/>
Level 15 - Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby<br/>
Run into an orc camp, cast this spell and they will all fall asleep allowing<br/>
you to attack them one by one. This spell gets more powerful as you go up<br/>
levels so after you gain a few more levels you can do the same at a dervish<br/>
camp. Very powerful spell when there are a lot of easier monsters attacking<br/>
you. It usualy works flawlessly on monsters that con green to you, works ok<br/>
on monsters that are blue and anything greater then blue it usually won&#39;t do<br/>
much to.<br/>
<br/>
Level 16 - Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre<br/>
As long as you are singing this song your party can remain underwater<br/>
indefinitely. If you want to explore underwater or get into combat<br/>
underwater this spell is a must<br/>
<br/>
Level 17 - Guardian Rhythms<br/>
This will increase your parties resistance against magic by 15 and 27 if<br/>
you&#39;re holding a drum plus it will increase your AC by 3 and 7 with a drum.<br/>
The AC increase is insignificant at this level so the level 13 spell seems<br/>
like a better one to keep memorized since it covers more attacks<br/>
<br/>
Level 18 - Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>
This is just like the level 2 spell except that it&#39;s area of effect is a<br/>
little smaller and it also reduces effected monsters AC. It dishes out<br/>
approximately 4 points of damage and 8 if you use it with a horn. If you<br/>
have a bunch of easier monsters attacking you and lulling them isn&#39;t worth<br/>
it then use this and they&#39;ll all be dead pretty quick<br/>
<br/>
Level 19 - Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>
This spell will make your party invisible but you must be holding a wind<br/>
instrument for it to work at all. Great spell for making your way through<br/>
dangerous areas like highpass hold by yourself but it doesn&#39;t work so well<br/>
in a party since the other pary members have to stay fairly close to you in<br/>
order to be effected and they can&#39;t see you<br/>
<br/>
Level 20 - Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>
This is another area effect combat spell so be careful around guards etc. It<br/>
apparently reduces the effected targets by decreasing their attack speed and<br/>
AC. I haven&#39;t been able to notice a difference so far; maybe I need to find<br/>
a stopwatch to time this stuff. Whether or not it works as assumed this<br/>
won&#39;t be one of those killer spells you&#39;ll find yourself looking forward to<br/>
<br/>
Level 21 - Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion<br/>
Cast this spell and roughly every 5 seconds it wills randomly teleport you<br/>
to a nearby location. Used with a wind instrument it will teleport you<br/>
farther. This spell even works in a dungeon but I couldn&#39;t get it to<br/>
teleport me through walls or locked doors. This might come in handy if<br/>
you&#39;re fighting in a dungeon and since you can&#39;t use your speed spell this<br/>
could give you a little head start if you wanted to run from a fight<br/>

Bard Songs<br/>
I&#39;ll do a short description of the first few songs bards receive.<br/>
After that, you&#39;ll be on your own, but help is always around the<br/>
corner. Politely asking a higher level bard will usually get you<br/>
the answers you seek.<br/>
<br/>
1. Chant of Battle - (Singing skill) Adds to your AC and strength.<br/>
 A weak effect, but you&#39;ll mostly be singing this song at a low<br/>
 level, and it will work well for you. This song affects everyone<br/>
in your party.<br/>
<br/>
2. Chords of Dissonance - (Stringed Instruments) Damages everything<br/>
 within a certain area from the person singing/playing the song.<br/>
A very useful spell for damaging monsters, especially those that<br/>
 cannot be harmed by normal weapons and/or a gang of monsters all<br/>
 in a group. This spell is VERY dangerous though, as everything<br/>
 affected by it will NOT be happy with you. In dungeons for<br/>
example, you will find yourself attacked by monsters that were<br/>
 ignoring you up until you started playing this song. In inns<br/>
 and cities, this song will get guards and merchants attacking<br/>
 YOU very quickly. I don&#39;t know a single bard who hasn&#39;t been<br/>
 killed because they played this song too close to a guard or<br/>
 merchant. When you use it, get in the habit of turning it off<br/>
IMMEDIATELY after you kill the monster you are fighting.<br/>
<br/>
3. Jaxan`s Jig o` Vigor - (Singing skill) This song increases your<br/>
 stamina as you sing it. Stamina is very important when you run<br/>
 long distances, or in long fights. This song affects everyone in<br/>
your party.<br/>
<br/>
4. Lyssa`s Locating Lyric - (Singing skill) If you have nothing<br/>
 targeted, this song finds the nearest corpse. Not too useful. The<br/>
 strength of this song lies in its targeted ability. Select the<br/>
person whose corpse you wish to locate (such as yourself), and<br/>
start singing. Soon your body will jerk around in the direction<br/>
of the corpse, and the corpse is selected. You will make many<br/>
friends with this song, locating long lost bodies, an all too<br/>
 common problem in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
5. Selo`s Accelerando - (Percussion skill) One of the best songs<br/>
 a bard has, this song enables the bard to run like the wind,<br/>
particularly if the person is using a drum and is skilled in its<br/>
 use. This song affects everyone in the party, and so is very<br/>
 popular for groups making a long distance trip. The song also<br/>
 decreases the stamina loss caused by running for long periods<br/>
of time. Whether it is getting from A to B faster or outrunning<br/>
 an angry swarm of monsters, this is one of the most handy songs<br/>
 a bard will ever sing.<br/>
<br/>
6. Hymn of Restoration - (Stringed Instruments) This is the cr´┐¢me<br/>
 de la cr´┐¢me of bard songs, at least in the first 10 levels. Singing<br/>
 this song provides a constant regeneration of health for as long<br/>
as the song is played. Healing rates vary with levels, but singing<br/>
 the song alone up to level 11 heals 3 hit points per &quot;pulse&quot;, which<br/>
 roughly equates to one round of combat. Playing this song with a<br/>
 stringed instrument increases the effect to 5 per pulse. This song<br/>
 effects everyone in your party and will really make you popular,<br/>
both among your fellow adventurers and among the monsters you are<br/>
fighting, who will often stop beating on the beefy fighters in the<br/>
 group to get at the pesky bard healing everyone. In a party that<br/>
switches off the person who is taking damage, this song is amazing,<br/>
 because it allows players to take damage, heal while someone else<br/>
 takes the damage, and then switch off again, vastly increasing<br/>
the durability of the party during a fight. After the fight is over,<br/>
 get our your lute and start playing. Soon, even the most grievously<br/>
 wounded fighter in the party will be ready to go again, all without<br/>
 mana expenditure.<br/>
<br/>
7. Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong - (Singing skill) This song is<br/>
essentially a beefed up &quot;Chant of Battle&quot; that only effects the<br/>
 singer. It has little use in a party, but is useful when soloing.<br/>
 Some say the healing song is better, but you don&#39;t need to heal<br/>
if they can&#39;t hit you.<br/>
<br/>
8. Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament - (Singing skill) Formerly used for<br/>
a different purpose, this song has been redone into a bard version<br/>
 of the Lull spell. This song is incredibly useful, allowing you<br/>
to tackle monsters who are in groups by lulling the monsters you<br/>
 do not wish to attack, then pulling the monsters you do. Monsters<br/>
 will occasionally resist your spell, or sometimes the lull effect<br/>
 will not be enough to keep them quiet, but this is still a<br/>
 wonderful addition to your songbook.<br/>
<br/>
9. Elemental Rhythms - (Percussion Instruments) This song vastly<br/>
 increases the party&#39;s resistance to fire, cold and magic,<br/>
particularly when played with a drum. Useful for fighting<br/>
 spellcasting monsters and the like, but the situations are<br/>
 pretty specialized.<br/>
<br/>
10. Anthem de Arms - (Singing skill) This song increases the<br/>
 party&#39;s strength and more importantly - attack speed! The<br/>
 increase in speed is hard to notice at times, but it is<br/>
there, and you will REALLY notice it in parties with a lot<br/>
 of &quot;hitters&quot;. If you are in a party that is fighting a lot<br/>
 of monsters and not taking a lot of damage, you will find<br/>
this song even better than the mighty Hymn of Restoration, and<br/>
 that is saying A LOT.<br/>
<br/>
11. Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrillon - This song causes a wave<br/>
of enchantment to wash over you and your NPC target, making the<br/>
 NPC like you more than they did before. In theory, this should<br/>
 make prices lower for you, and make hostile NPCs more likely<br/>
 to appreciate you. The effect is small and hard to notice,<br/>
 however.<br/>
<br/>
12. Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow - (Singing Skill) This is the<br/>
 bard&#39;s single target, direct damage song. Although the amount<br/>
 of damage done by the song is low compared to the direct<br/>
 damage spells of a wizard or other spellcaster of the same<br/>
 level, the fact that it can be sung without mana makes this<br/>
song special. This spell is especially good for getting a<br/>
monster&#39;s attention, damaging monsters that re vulnerable<br/>
only to magic or disrupting spellcasters who have Rooted you<br/>
 outside of weapon range. Additionally, this song really ticks<br/>
 the monsters off, so it is useful if you want to taunt their<br/>
attention off someone else in a fight.<br/>
<br/>
13. Purifying Rhythms - (Percussion Skill) This is similar to<br/>
 Elemental Rhythms in that it raises your party&#39;s resistances,<br/>
 in this case, Poison, Magic and Disease resistance. This song<br/>
is very useful, especially if juggled with an offensive song,<br/>
 as there are a great many monsters who disease and poison,<br/>
both of which are very annoying effects.<br/>
<br/>
14. Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto -- This song is similar to the<br/>
Identify series of spells possessed by other spellcasters.<br/>
 Currently, this song is not of much use, since all items are<br/>
 itentified.<br/>
<br/>
15. Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby - (Stringed Instruments) This song<br/>
 does what you would expect a lullaby to do - it puts things<br/>
 to sleep. Similar to Chords of Dissonance, this song affects<br/>
everything in a certain radius, so it should be used with<br/>
 care, but its effect is incredibly useful. Found yourself<br/>
 surrounded by monsters, trapped with no way out and about<br/>
to<br/>
 die? Put them to sleep! This song is the Feign Death of the<br/>
 bard class, and it will save your life many times. It is<br/>
fairly easily resisted though, so be ready for monsters who<br/>
 didn&#39;t appreciate your bedtime tunes.<br/>
<br/>
16. Tarew`s Aquatic Ayre - (Wind Instruments) This song allows<br/>
 and your entire party you to breath underwater, adventuring<br/>
 in areas other players can only dream of.<br/>
<br/>
17. Guardian Rhythms - (Percussion Instruments) This song increases<br/>
 the party&#39;s magic resistance and creates a &quot;spell shield&quot;. Just<br/>
 how the spell shield part of this song works is unknown to the<br/>
 author, but presumably the party is much more resistant to magical<br/>
 attack while the bard plays this song.<br/>
<br/>
18. Denon`s Disruptive Discord - (Brass Instruments) This song is<br/>
 very similar to Chords of Dissonance, except that in addition to<br/>
 damaging your opponents, it lowers their AC as well. This is the<br/>
first song that REQUIRES the bard use an instrument, as it cannot<br/>
 be sung for lesser effect.<br/>
<br/>
19. Shauri`s Sonorous Clouding - (Wind Instruments) Like Denon&#39;s<br/>
 Discord, this song requires the use of an instrument, but the<br/>
 effects of the song are more than worth this limitation. Shauri`s<br/>
 Sonorous Clouding makes the entire party inivisible, allowing<br/>
them to simply walk through areas that would otherwise would be<br/>
 completely inaccessable to them. Keep in mind though, that some<br/>
monsters can see invisible players.<br/>
<br/>
20. Shauri`s Sonorous Clouding - (Wind Instruments) Like Denon&#39;s<br/>
 Discord, this song requires the use of an instrument, but the<br/>
 effects of the song are more than worth this limitation. Shauri`s<br/>
 Sonorous Clouding makes the entire party inivisible, allowing<br/>
them to simply walk through areas that would otherwise would be<br/>
 completely inaccessable to them. Keep in mind though, that some<br/>
monsters can see invisible players.<br/>
