<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120406719">Yes it happens to me a lot.  Just like others had suggested, /pet back off <br/>
is the only command that will work.<br/>
<br/>
This is my guess why this happens:<br/>
<br/>
You charmed a mob and tell it to attack another mob.<br/>
When the charm wore off, he comes and attack you.<br/>
You recharm it and normally it will go and attack the previous target<br/>
  before he was on.<br/>
But somehow the moment before he was recharmed, he accquired a new<br/>
  target whom is your groupmate.<br/>
So when he is recharmed, he went back to attack your groupmate.<br/>
<br/>
I have OTHER&#39;S HIT turned off.. so this is pretty annoying to me for I wont <br/>
know my pet is hitting my groupmate until I was told. :(<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been playing with charm a lot lately (wonderful for<br/>
&gt;pulling a mob off someone it&#39;s frenzied against), and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;noticed a recurring problem.  Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>
&gt;attack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>
&gt;not stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>
&gt;attack another mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>
&gt;this happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>
&gt;mob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>
&gt;re-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>
&gt;charmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>
&gt;attacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We were almost killed by a cyclops last night because a stupid<br/>
&gt;kodiak tagged along and I wasted time trying to charm it to<br/>
&gt;take it out of the fight and it kept right on attacking.<br/>
&gt;(OTOH my ranger friend was absolutely ecstatic when the<br/>
&gt;cyclops frenzied on him, got him down to one bubble as the<br/>
&gt;cleric went OOM, and I charmed the cyclops to pull it off<br/>
&gt;him.)<br/>
