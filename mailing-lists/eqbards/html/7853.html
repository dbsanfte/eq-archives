<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735650154">In theory, I agree with you.  Tell me about your wonderful adventure getting<br/>
a Polish Garnet Tommychopper. Why do I think the story would go something<br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We spent four cold rainy Norrath days and nights in the Highhold Pass.<br/>
Many foul gnolls fell to our blades.  We dealt with shamans, brawlers and<br/>
champions.  Some fights were so close we praised the gods that we survived!<br/>
And then thru the mist, he appeared - the head muckity-muck of the MuckTail<br/>
Clan - Granix Mucktail himself!  We took a deep breath, we drew our swords,<br/>
we said our prayers and then.........<br/>
<br/>
Cecille begins to cast a spell...<br/>
Toronto begins to cast a spell...<br/>
Talishar begins to cast a spell...<br/>
<br/>
And when the particles cleared the air...<br/>
<br/>
Cecille auctions PGT bids start at 250pp!<br/>
<br/>
(For those of you who don&#39;t play on Innoruuk server, the names have NOT been<br/>
changed to protect the guilty Ks&#39;ers.)<br/>
<br/>
It would be an entirely different game if......<br/>
<br/>
1.	There was no camping/farming (lots of good ways to fix this - don&#39;t<br/>
really matter how)<br/>
2.	There were no Kill Stealing (again good ways to fix and perhaps we<br/>
are actually gonna see some implemented.)<br/>
3.	There was no internet (ie: spolier sites and instant flow of<br/>
information)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ok, so this is Guk - where do we go from here?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Who&#39;s got the maps?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Lemme log quick and grab one&quot;<br/>
&quot;Nm, I&#39;ll print one off me laptop - one sec&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the way it is so we end up with a player driven economy.  My<br/>
group has lots of money and we buy the stuff we want/need and simply avoid<br/>
the ks&#39;ing campers.  We did have one really lucky night in the Tae room in<br/>
Cazic and got some rubi panties.  The next night was KS-Hell and we have not<br/>
been back.  Stoopid Kyle, does he really think that we don&#39;t have see invis?<br/>
So the moron sits by the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Right now - its damn near impossible to get the stuff you want the old<br/>
fashion way so you end up buying it and hunting other places for xp.  Let&#39;s<br/>
see some gators drop some rubi - mebbe they ate some one who was wearing<br/>
some!  I know they ate me and my steel plate!<br/>
<br/>
Also have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>
armors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is in<br/>
stat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a decent<br/>
difference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night, our group spent 4 hours in Unrest and we got virtually a full<br/>
set of small bronze - pretty good night.  So, what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to<br/>
do with it?  Sell it to the local young warriors and endure another 2 hours<br/>
of hard luck tales and haggling over 2pp here and 4pp there?  Or would it be<br/>
ok with you if I started a gnome warrior and gave it to him when his corpse<br/>
stopped decaying in 15 minutes?  Or would it be ok with you if I just gave<br/>
it to the next cute little wood elf who might look even cuter in all bronze<br/>
while I am waiting for the wiz to break camp and port us back to<br/>
civilization?  <br/>
<br/>
Put a little magic happiness in some ones life - twink them!~<br/>

		My Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!<br/>
Not that I do<br/>
		not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If<br/>
you twink a<br/>
		character, you are giving them something, but you are also<br/>
taking something<br/>
		even more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull<br/>
experience of leveling on<br/>
		their own.</div>
