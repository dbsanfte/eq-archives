<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362447421">Only because if I ever get a secondary pull then I can lullaby the<br/>
secondary target. Where I&#39;m using lullaby is a place like Permafrost.<br/>
Let&#39;s say I pull good ol&#39; King Thex up to near the gate, and there is<br/>
some annoying prelate hitting him with heal. If I can&#39;t move the king to<br/>
a place far enough for the healer, I pull the healer into melee range<br/>
and &quot;supress him&quot; while I finish the King off (both are green btw).<br/>
<br/>
When I used lullaby in group, it suppressed a bok frogluk knight and the<br/>
gargoyle outside the froggie king&#39;s room, while we tackled a kor frogluk<br/>
shaman and a second bok first. It took awhile to get both of these to<br/>
stop swinging, so maybe the person who said it only works if it pulses<br/>
when they are not in the middle of an attack is onto something. Once<br/>
they were knocked out though, they stayed knocked out. I melee&#39;d off the<br/>
tank&#39;s target using /assist the entire fight, so it again made the ae<br/>
effect very useful as opposed to the target only song.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Just curious as to why you would use lullaby instead of pixie strike to<br/>
&gt; interrupt casters?  I have fantastic luck using strike for that purpose, but<br/>
&gt; occasionally the timing will get off and I lose a bubble in a single cast, never<br/>
&gt; fun.  Haven&#39;t tried lullaby for quite a while - have you tested both and found<br/>
&gt; lullaby to be more useful?  Either way, guess I&#39;ll give it a try...<br/>
