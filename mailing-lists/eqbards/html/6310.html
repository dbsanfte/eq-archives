the legends and have a reasonable expectation of finding them in place.<br/>
<br/>
So far I like best the idea that certain items or NPCs can be looted only<br/>
once by a given character.  How about adding permanent hate with a<br/>
vengence?  If you got or would have gotten XP for killing a particularly<br/>
valuable NPC, you&#39;re on the permanent hate list.   That means you have an<br/>
extremely high probability of being killed by a super frenzy of that NPC or<br/>
some other NPC that shows up there only to exact such vengence.  So not<br/>
only could you not loot the same item, if you go back after the same NPC<br/>
you&#39;ll most likely die, even if you just poke it from a distance.<br/>
