<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098958255">I believe he already stated he got into the lava because of going linkdead<br/>
didn&#39;t he?  I don&#39;t want to read that whole long thing again.  Point is, the<br/>
GM&#39; / Guides won&#39;t even help get your corpse when you die from a bug.  I<br/>
actually had a guide accuse me of purposely dragging mobs to a point where,<br/>
if I died, my corpse would fall beneath the world in W karana.  WTF?  Like<br/>
its hard to find a corpse in w karana near the q hills zone.<br/>

Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that GM&#39;s and Guides<br/>
must help you if you cannot get<br/>
your corpse?<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it is stuck in a wall.<br/>
Or fallen through the world.<br/>
Or lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>
<br/>
If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you<br/>
made friends)<br/>
<br/>
To say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke<br/>
saying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>
this knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back<br/>
on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse. I have had<br/>
guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>
on the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot<br/>
where&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>
been retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own<br/>
doing. (Lag related or not).<br/>
<br/>
What you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist you when the<br/>
chips are down.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava, don&#39;t go crying<br/>
about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>
your aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Take responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug,<br/>
then by all means call a GM.<br/>
