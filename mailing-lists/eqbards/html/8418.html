<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522276493">Wow.. you have a daunting task ahead of you.  Playing a bard effectively,<br/>
especially solo, requires a lot of timing, patience, and strategy, and a<br/>
little luck.  Playing just one song is recipe for disaster (especially<br/>
solo).  It&#39;s taken me a long time to get the hang of switching weapons,<br/>
instruments, songs, hotkey banks, keeping an eye on my health, MOBs health,<br/>
knowing when to run, knowing when to stay, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the other classes have a pretty straight forward approach to combat<br/>
- not so with the bard.  For starters, you&#39;ll have to twist 3 to 4 songs in<br/>
any given combat (usually).  If the weapons just aren&#39;t cutting it, you<br/>
might want to try juggling different songs with the appropriate instruments<br/>
while attacking hand-to-hand.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t even begin to tell you exactly what to do, w/o knowing his weapons<br/>
and what songs he has memorized and what MOBs you&#39;re fighting.  Even if I<br/>
could, it would take you awhile to get used to switching/juggling so many<br/>
things at once.  We [bards] have, literally, thousands of different ways to<br/>
approach combat.  Some will get you killed, some work okay - while others<br/>
will guarantee victory.<br/>
<br/>
I would play with his bard on really low green stuff and get the hang of<br/>
twisting different songs, etc.  Then slowly work up to harder stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, but I&#39;m not sure in what capacity.<br/>

&gt; I have a big problem and I am hoping that somebody can help me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My brother is away on vacation and i play his character (a <br/>
&gt; bard) and died and<br/>
&gt; lose a level. I play other characters (ranger,druid,warrior) <br/>
&gt; into the 20s, but I<br/>
&gt; never play anything like this one now. He is in the low 40s <br/>
&gt; and even if i fight<br/>
&gt; things that are green (tried a cyclops) i have to run so far. <br/>
&gt; I really need<br/>
&gt; somebody to please tell me how to fight with a bard like this <br/>
&gt; and what to fight<br/>
&gt; so i can get him back his level before he comes home and <br/>
&gt; kicks my butt!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The guy has all the songs i think and i just dont know how to <br/>
&gt; fight right. When<br/>
&gt; I just fight with 2 swords i get killed even with the beserk <br/>
&gt; song playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please help!<br/>
