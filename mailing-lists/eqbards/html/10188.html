<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122113486">I would imagine Verant&#39;s decision to upgrade Paw was based on analysis of<br/>
hard data.  They know how many true EQ newbies there are from sales totals.<br/>
They know what the mean level is for each server is.  They know how many<br/>
people do not renew their account once the subscription runs out.  They have<br/>
heard all the complaints about lack of things to do for high level players.<br/>
The expansion is scheduled to come out in March 2000.  Prior to then, if<br/>
their analysis indicates that the number of high level players who will quit<br/>
is higher than the number of new subsciptions, then I would guess we are<br/>
likely to see it happen in more places than Paw and Kithicor.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that Verant is increasing the difficulty by<br/>
&gt; leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in order to compensate for the high<br/>
&gt; level player base.  This is detrimental to the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>
&gt; started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>
&gt; spell for them) and travel the boat to Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>
&gt; Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK, WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>
&gt; avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level escort during the day and save a<br/>
&gt; bunch<br/>
&gt; of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has no idea of what awaits him when<br/>
&gt; he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.  Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
&gt; and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you had no friends in EQ and got<br/>
&gt; killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric somewhere between WC and the<br/>
&gt; Rivervale entrance?<br/>
