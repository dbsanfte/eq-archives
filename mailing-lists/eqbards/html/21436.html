<div id="ygrps-yiv-712914862">what he probably meant was that bards cannot sneak and hide at the same<br/>
time, which is what makes rogues so good at most CR situations.  for rogues<br/>
if you sneak and hide at the same time, you can move around while hidden.<br/>
no other class can do this.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ll refer you to a fine site by a guy named Rokenn that says that bards get<br/>
&gt;hide at level 25 with a cap of 40 (unless you&#39;re a wood elf, then your born<br/>
&gt;with a 50 skill) and sneak at level 17 with a 75 cap.  :P<br/>
