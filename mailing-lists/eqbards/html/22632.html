Maybe those are only certain npc&#39;s once you start the quests.  Which is<br/>
kinda crazy imho.  If these things are &quot;epic,&quot; why not have them be dream<br/>
items that folks complete over a long eq career?  I just dont get making<br/>
high level players perma-camp boss mobs in green dungeons for stuff they<br/>
need to go where they are supposed to go (keys for example.) But them again,<br/>
it would be even worse if those dungeons actually had groups playing in<br/>
them.  I mean how pissed would you be  if your group fought for over an hour<br/>
to finally get to the church in Kaesora and see some level 54 there soloing<br/>
all the mobs while he waits for Xalgoz.  &quot;Damn, another crappy rogue poker.<br/>
Damn, he dropped that crappy blade.&quot;  <br/>

Grats :o)<br/>
On a side note:  I was able to get the Quest Giver NPC to give me the quest<br/>
the other night :o)  I was afraid that I wouldn&#39;t be able to get him to talk<br/>
to me until I was 45 or 46.<br/>
