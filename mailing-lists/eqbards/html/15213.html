&gt; The incident that happened was when we was happily controlling the spawn in<br/>
&gt; the king room when two low 30&#39;s people came along, decided to run down<br/>
&gt; through the doors and trained 2 Giants (we had killed the diplomat). After<br/>
&gt; killing both these people they came for me. I tried to make a runner but<br/>
&gt; only got to the flag room.<br/>

&gt; This also shows that bard song taunts have not been reduced, god knows how<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, the ice giants inside Permafrost just have a huge aggro<br/>
radius.  Usually they aggro on you before you ever see them.  <br/>
Once the two idiots got the giants close to you and died, the<br/>
giants aggroed on all of you.  Since you were playing a song,<br/>
you got placed higher on the hate list than anyone else there,<br/>
and promptly got killed.<br/>
<br/>
Subjectively, I&#39;d say our taunt has been reduced a bit.  <br/>
Granted I was fighting bugs in Sol B which tend not to care.  <br/>
But it seemed to me I had to work harder to get things to<br/>
attack me, even when I was using the Celerity, Hymn, Chain<br/>
combo (the latter two are pretty good taunts).<br/>
