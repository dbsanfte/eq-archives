<div id="ygrps-yiv-941934710">I have been camping the West Common zone and Rivervale Zone.  I start to see<br/>
things on tracking as early as 7pm and by 9pm the list is full. One pull at<br/>
9pm by RV zone and enough other stuff agros on our fites until the they quit<br/>
spawning around 4am to 6am.  From then til 10 or noonish, you need a cleric<br/>
or pallie to cast sense undead which will see the few that are left over -<br/>
but beware sense undead will see all the way across the zone.<br/>
<br/>
I went out to pull for a day time kill and managed to snag not one but two<br/>
enraged dread wolf puppys.  Fortunately, I managed to run - but got a bit<br/>
lost and just ran the first zone wall I hit (from between HH and WC going<br/>
past the lake) until I found an exit (WC zone.)  I didn&#39;t see anyone else<br/>
but if I had it woulda been a mess for them.   I have snagged OPT&#39;s (other<br/>
player&#39;s trains) in the same manner.  Running the wall, see some one go by,<br/>
wonder where is he going in such a hurry, wonder hmm where did this Zombie<br/>
trooper come from???<br/>
<br/>
So, run the wall at night if you dare - but mobs path all the way to the<br/>
wall and players will train to zones - no two ways about it.<br/>

		Bah!! I&#39;ve run thru at night SEVERAL times and have had NO<br/>
problem<br/>
		whatsoever. Didn&#39;t even see anything to sneeze at and I&#39;m<br/>
only a L19 bard.<br/>
		Maybe it depends HOW you run thru? I usually take the<br/>
wall/zone edge that<br/>
		goes directly left coming out of HH, where you pass<br/>
Rivervale zonepoint and<br/>
		can get to WC zonepoint in a jiffy... Maybe that&#39;s why I<br/>
didn&#39;t see<br/>
		anything?? Does anyone have any specific &quot;Norrath TIME&quot; on<br/>
when those<br/>
		baddies spawn besides just saying &quot;nighttime&quot; ??<br/>
