<b>Subject:</b> RE: Levels after hell levels <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-416155647">i&#39;ve noticed this both times i have gone through the hell levels and hell+1<br/>
levels.  most recent experience, died at least 4 times in level 40, about<br/>
1/4 bubb per loss.  died 4 times in the last 2 days in level 41, 1 full<br/>
bubble every death.  anyway, we all knew this, just confirming i&#39;ve seen it<br/>
all twice now.  also agree that hell+1 levels take less exp to get through.<br/>
and my theory on hell levels is that level 30 is 2x exp, 35 is 3x, 40 is 4x,<br/>
and 45 is 5x normal exp.  that is what it felt like the first time, and what<br/>
it feels like now.<br/>
<br/>
something i&#39;d like to know is if a cleric&#39;s res takes into account the type<br/>
of exp you lost (regular, hell, or hell+1 exp), or if it is purely random.<br/>
out of the 4 level 50 resses i got in the last 2 days from level 41 deaths<br/>
(it&#39;s good to have friends), it seemed i got less than what i would normally<br/>
get in a regular level.  leads me to believe a res in a hell+1 still resses<br/>
as if you lose regular level exp.<br/>

&gt; Both of these indicate the exp loss at (hell level+1) is<br/>
&gt; greater than at other levels.<br/>
