<div id="ygrps-yiv-838471186">Actually I should have said a couple of months ago.  Time goes by fast in EQ<br/>
:)  I have been level 20 and 21 for almost a month and a half now.  Nixx was<br/>
new to me at level 19 when I had been in Paw ever since level 12 (not<br/>
staying there, just kept going back).  So when you see something for the<br/>
first time after being in an area for a long time you are going to call it<br/>
&#39;new&#39;.<br/>

&gt; Nixx Nenix - or whatever his name is - is not new. He killed me in Paw<br/>
&gt; a few months ago. He has been on my list of NPCs to kill for quite some<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -----------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I found the same thing in Paw a couple of weeks ago.  There was a<br/>
&gt; darkelf necromancer named Nixx Nenix roaming Paw.  I was just coming<br/>
&gt; out after<br/>
&gt; successfully defeating Shaman Ren Rex and saw a dark elf swimming.  I<br/>
&gt; figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over<br/>
&gt; time(DOT). I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out<br/>
&gt; and theDOT still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571<br/>
&gt; hit points at level 19).&quot;<br/>
