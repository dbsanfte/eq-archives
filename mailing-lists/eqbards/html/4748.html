<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838639510">I dont know what your problem is, but your sarcasm at my question was<br/>
uncalled for. Not to mention that I didn&#39;t say a thing about whether Chant<br/>
could stack with Celerity. I asked if Celerity stacked with Anthem and if<br/>
so, WHY someone would stack Celerity and Chant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Yes, the reason why ppl stack Chant of Battle with <br/>
&gt; Celerity is because it won&#39;t stack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that I have Celerity and<br/>
&gt; stack it with Chant of Battle<br/>
&gt; I never touch Bellows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious, does Celerity stack with Anthem<br/>
&gt; de Arms? If so, I&#39;m interested in why one would<br/>
&gt; choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. </span></blockquote></div>
