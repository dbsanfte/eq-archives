<b>Subject:</b> Corpse Bugs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578891868">This was QUITE some time ago - and perhaps a bug that was fixed...  But<br/>
my best-buddy and I were fighting in Befallen and he got killed.  Bound<br/>
naturally in West Freeport - he ran back and I tried to use Lyss&#39;s to locate<br/>
the Corpse.  It gave extremely confusing results.  At the time I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize that the corpse was in an un-reachable location (in a wall<br/>
probably) - since I didn&#39;t know about that bug.  He tried petitioning a GM -<br/>
but none were online (this was pretty late on a Sunday night).  I tried the<br/>
chat servers - no GM or Guides.  I even tried a char on another server. -<br/>
just as I log in - a Guide logs out.  No luck...<br/>
<br/>
    We are wits end not sure what to do - he&#39;s getting real frustrated...<br/>
So for some reason he decides to log out to create a char on another server<br/>
and see if there are any GM&#39;s there.  No luck - but he comes back - and the<br/>
corpse was moved to a reachable location.<br/>
<br/>
    So again - perhaps things have changed - but if you do find yourself in<br/>
this dilemma - a quick log-out and log-in is worth a try - it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
cost you anything...<br/>
