<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617230276">Either I misunderstood you here or you may be a bit<br/>
off.  The scaler level bonus is (level-25)/3 (Note:<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about post 50 but this holds true up to<br/>
50) for 1h weapons and is primary hand only (there is<br/>
a slightly different 2h damage scalar for 2h weapons).<br/>
 I.e. at level 50 every time you hit with your main<br/>
weapon you do an additional 8 points of damage.  The<br/>
easy way to test that this is primary hand only is to<br/>
DW two different types of weapons and log the results.<br/>
 Look for your minimum hits not your maximum as that&#39;s<br/>
a more easily identifiable number.  Your minimum hit<br/>
with primary hand will be 1+bonus and your min with<br/>
secondary hand will be 1.  <br/>

Speaking of bunuses:<br/>
<br/>
The strength and dex bonus are not applied to your<br/>
offhand.  HOWEVER the LEVEL based Damage bonus is.<br/>
<br/>
Level based bonus seems to be (Bonus=(level-25))<br/>
I&#39;ve heard level-20 but haven&#39;t seen results to back<br/>
that up yet.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I can hit for up to 22dmg with my Bladed<br/>
Thulian Claws and have hit for 23 with my Saeiny&#39;s<br/>
claw (in my offhand).<br/>
