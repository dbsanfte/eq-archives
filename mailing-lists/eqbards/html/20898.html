<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-350222803">100 seemed to be the magic number, but.<br/>
<br/>
Doing some extensive testing at Dex&#39;s between 85 and 143 I found that procs<br/>
occurred about twice as often at 100 as at 85.  It doubled again at or near<br/>
132 in my tests and not much change thereafter. ymmv.<br/>

So, anyone have any real statistics? Also I assumed that getting agi over<br/>
100 was important, is there some magic number in particular to reach?<br/>
