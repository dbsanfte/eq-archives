Unfortunately, they have to outdo competitors with &quot;features&quot;, which they<br/>
feel the customer needs (suuure we need it).. but I must agree with you.. if<br/>
it were left up to the programmers, Microsoft Office would run in 512K RAM<br/>
and only use 2 Megs of HD space, and be faster, and more powerful. :)<br/>

&gt; I know this ought to be KA-Bonged - but I can&#39;t help but defend my<br/>
&gt; profession...  The source of bloatware can be found very simply in the<br/>
&gt; marketing department of software companies.  Bloatware is caused by adding<br/>
&gt; feature upon feature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Programmers are assigned tasks by management.  Most would be just as happy<br/>
&gt; to work on making their code smaller and more efficient than adding a new<br/>
&gt; feature....<br/>
