<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013024412">Actually what I heard was that Verant decided to change an Everquest myth<br/>
into a reality because they were certain it would never be realized that was<br/>
what had happened.  They supposedly, according to a former GM, changed the<br/>
amount of xp needed to get the last bubble.  They added about 5 deaths worth<br/>
of xp to the last bubble at each level for the various classes.<br/>

Hmm if they increased the amount of exp to gain a level I guaruntee you<br/>
people would notice, so I seriously doubt this is the case.<br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t forget, however, at least according to our former inside source,<br/>
&gt;JM Cappozi, that they also massively increased the amount of exp<br/>
&gt;required to level shortly after this without telling us. Still,<br/>
&gt;psychologically, not losing 2+ bubbles when you die (man did that suck)<br/>
&gt;is a lot easier to take, even if it takes just as long to make back the<br/>
&gt;exp you lost as it did when you did lose it.<br/>
