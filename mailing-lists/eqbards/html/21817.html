<div id="ygrps-yiv-67201181">Our 34th level enchanter regularly keeps 4 mobs mezz&#39;d with single target<br/>
mez.  I was never able to keep that many experience giving mobs mezz&#39;d with<br/>
Lullaby reliably.<br/>

i think lullaby is simply too powerful as designed for a bard.  my roommate<br/>
has a high level cleric and he was talking to some 50+ enchanters about<br/>
their ae mez.  basically they don&#39;t use it.  if they get 2 resists they are<br/>
dead.<br/>
occasionally they might use it as a stopgap on a really bad pull, but then<br/>
they stun and individually mez each mob afterwards.  for a bard however,<br/>
we get to wear armor, have a reasonable amount of hitpoints and only<br/>
get interrupted by bashes.  if we get a couple of resists occasionally it<br/>
just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a big deal.  what i think would be better is if they just wrote<br/>
off<br/>
lullaby as too powerful and put the targetted mez at about a 20% resist<br/>
rate.<br/>
that way you could have 2 mobs mezzed most of the time or 1 mob if<br/>
you really wanted to make sure it was mezzed.<br/>

&gt;Make the songs in question require an instrument much the way that Sonorous<br/>
&gt;Clouding currently does.  Make a string instrument mandatory for Lucid<br/>
&gt;Lullaby and a wind instrument mandatory for Pixie Strike.  At the same time<br/>
&gt;remove the secondary resist that has rendered these spellsongs impotent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think this change is in line with the bardic theme, makes the songs a<br/>
&gt;viable option, and maintains the necessary amount of balance over these<br/>
&gt;songs.<br/>
