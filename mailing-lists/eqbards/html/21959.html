<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452953395">Heh heh, you can see the charges on the item even while the merchant has it.<br/>
It only has one anyhow, but even having 1 Greater Heal handy for emergencies<br/>
is a nice boon for 2pp, especially since Light Heal potions cost 11pp and<br/>
are Lore.  With my Squad Ring (Healing 1chg, rechargeable), Prayer Beads<br/>
(Healing 2chgs), and new Ring (Greater Healing 1chg) I have quite an arsenal<br/>
of emergency healing on hand.  Thankfully the Ring and Prayer Beads are no<br/>
No Drop so I can move them to another character if necessary.<br/>
