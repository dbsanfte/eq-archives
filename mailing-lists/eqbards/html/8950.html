<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224968845">well my theory is that green stuff is harder to chain then blue to red...<br/>
maybe its a sorta anti farm code they implemented, sorta like a level 50 not<br/>
camping ambassador crush (or something the likes), they want to give him<br/>
somewhat of a chance to run for it. making it aggravating for the farmer<br/>
gets so annoyed that he just leaves the zone<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I was chaining SG&#39;s last night no problem.  Maybe 1 resist in<br/>
&gt; about 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; attempts. (I was soloing, so a LOT of chaining was used).  Later I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking by Dorn&#39;s camp and decided to kill him just to pass a minute or<br/>
&gt; two.<br/>
&gt; &gt; After pounding him down to within an inch of his life, he started to<br/>
&gt; run.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; fired up chains.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  5 resists<br/>
&gt; &gt; before it took.  Dunno if its always been like this or not with Dorn,<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; time I fought him I was around level 15.  Seemed strange though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm. Maybe the resist rates have just been cranked up on certain mobs<br/>
&gt; then.<br/>
