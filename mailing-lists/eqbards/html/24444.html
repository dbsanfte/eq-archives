<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142562839"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Has it been confirmed that he drops both white and red dragonscales?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Red Scales are the only thing that&#39;s been &quot;confirmed&quot;.  There&#39;s <br/>
rumors floating around saying a white scale is the rare drop, but <br/>
those always include reference to some un-named friend of a relatives <br/>
vet who talked to a guy that was in The Hole when another group <br/>
killed Nortlav.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s said to be L55. Does he fight like VS? And since I&#39;ve <br/>
 </span></blockquote>personally been on no raids on VS, I don&#39;t know the tactics used on <br/>
him either. If anyone would be able to sneak in some secrets on how <br/>
to kill this scalekeeper, or if he does in fact fight like Venril <br/>
Sathir, how to defeat him.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and yes.  Heavy Runes and Defensive Disciplines I think are the <br/>
most common strategies for Venril.  I haven&#39;t killed him either, so <br/>
maybe someone else can confirm.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And is it true that the &quot;spawned&quot; or &quot;mini&quot; Trakanon is just L55, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>which drops only the guts for our quest? About how many would it <br/>
take, and approx Levels to defeat him at this level?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the same level and difficulty of the normal Trak.  Although, <br/>
he&#39;s unbuffed (just having spawned and all), you&#39;re able to clear his <br/>
lair without him being in it, and you can spawn him where you want to <br/>
fight him.  Those 3 things makes him easier to kill.<br/>
<br/>
He drops a Kunark BP + Trak Guts.  You&#39;re looking at 30-40 people at <br/>
an average level of 55.<br/>
