<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826518002">OH MY GOD!!! that would be so great.  Let me tell you all why....<br/>
<br/>
I HATE GNOMES!!!<br/>
<br/>
My druid hunts the guards...only gnome guards because I hate gnomes so<br/>
much.  I took my bard to steamfront one day there to hunt by herself. <br/>
Well she never been there before.  I asked out to teh zone what a lvl 7<br/>
could hunt.  They all told me to hunt rats....rats???  I conned and<br/>
they were all green.  I asked um...but they are green?  And they all<br/>
answered me &quot;oh and you want experience too?&quot;  then they brought on<br/>
some other rude comments to me and to various others in the zone.  I<br/>
even watched one try to con some guy out of 25p to do the observer<br/>
quest for him.  (like i would hand over the lens to a stranger and let<br/>
them do the quest for me!!).  Anyway I soon after left.  Now I go back<br/>
there with my druid and kill the guards.  I get there and I will be<br/>
medding in between killing the miserable little runts and the gnomes<br/>
will run up to me in hordes begging for SOW or other buffs.  Then they<br/>
beg me to let them loot the guards I have just killed.  When I refused<br/>
(have to finance my own char too and at anywhere from 2 to around 8<br/>
plat per gnome...I make money quite well and still never have enough<br/>
for what I need).  Well I actually had one rude little bugger argue<br/>
with me saying that they needed money worse than I did.  Why does it<br/>
always seem that gnomes have a bad attitude!  <br/>
<br/>
Nothing would make me happier than to watch waves of gnomes jump into<br/>
pools of lava!  actually truth be known...my druid would be happy to<br/>
give ports to anyone who wants to do this since she resides on E&#39;ci to<br/>
begin with.  So binds and ports would be provided by me and any other<br/>
druids i can find (i have a few in my guild who might help).  <br/>

&gt; community <br/>
&gt; to join ranks and set out to do something truly silly and pointless <br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point, I am sure you are thinking, &quot;What can we do together,<br/>
&gt; Aloro, <br/>
&gt; that would be silly and pointless and FUN?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You ARE thinking that, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good! So here is my proposal:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What: Gnomestock &#39;99<br/>
&gt; When: Friday, November 26th, starting at noon PST (or another time if<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; community prefers...)<br/>
&gt; Who: Anyone who plays a bard on EQ, or any of their friends, family,<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; pets.<br/>
&gt; Where: E&#39;ci, starting in Ak&#39;Anon, we shall make a glorious<br/>
&gt; lemming-like run <br/>
&gt; to Lavastorm, there to practice cliff-diving ito lava. We&#39;ll need to<br/>
&gt; get <br/>
&gt; bound in Freeport so wave after wave of gnomes can hurl themselves<br/>
&gt; into <br/>
&gt; fiery doom.<br/>
&gt; How: Create a first level gnome character. We should all have names<br/>
&gt; that are <br/>
&gt; somehow similar... one idea would be that all our names start with<br/>
&gt; Gn, so <br/>
&gt; the puzzled PCs who watch wave after wave of gnomes run by will see<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; connection. If we all have similar names it will make it easier to<br/>
&gt; find each <br/>
&gt; other too... it might be advisable to try to make a gnomish<br/>
&gt; equivalent of <br/>
&gt; your bardic name (thus e.g. I could make a gnome named Gnaloro). I<br/>
&gt; suppose <br/>
&gt; it might even be possible to form a guild for this event (Gnomestock<br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; be a good one... I don&#39;t really know how hard it is to start a new<br/>
&gt; guild or <br/>
&gt; how long it takes, but it would be nice to have guildchat, and the<br/>
&gt; guild <br/>
&gt; name would be priceless).<br/>
&gt; Why: Because we like you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to see something like this come together. let me know if it<br/>
&gt; sounds <br/>
&gt; like a good idea and if you want to participate... if there&#39;s enough<br/>
&gt; support <br/>
&gt; this could be hilarious. We can make some marching<br/>
&gt; songs, and maybe sing cadences as we run...<br/>
