<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards]Anyone tried this new MS commander with EQ yet? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842860826">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
You know, I haven&#39;t played EQ in weeks, what with the nerfs causing the<br/>
boredom of the EverCamp mentality to become excruciatingly apparent to me,<br/>
but I am upgrading my PC this weekend (after 3 years) and I saw an<br/>
interesting new item that&#39;s on the market.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else noticed the Microsoft Strategic Commander?  I saw it and became<br/>
curious.  Come to find out they are hyping ut as not only a RTS controller,<br/>
but a a role playing controller as well.  Hmmmmm....  It even comes with 3<br/>
pre-configured control sets for Asheron&#39;s Call (magic user, fighter with<br/>
magic, and warrior or something to that effect).<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo, my question was, has anyone tried this thing with EQ?  If so, how is<br/>
it?  I know that several people on the list use other game controllers to<br/>
play, wondered if anyone had checked this one out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
