<div id="ygrps-yiv-15035926">Maybe but PoF was the end all for high levels on E&#39;ci for the past two<br/>
weeks. Except we ran into a slight problem and after the last patch Verant<br/>
made the special items rare drops. So now while we had PoF cracked for two<br/>
weeks and room for people to join Lower Guk and Sol B also, Verant suddenly<br/>
changes it and ruins yet again something else for people. Why must they make<br/>
this game so time consuming?<br/>

&gt;I would not count on the Plane of Hate being a cure-all for high-level zone<br/>
&gt;overcrowding. As Brad said recently to a group on the Fear Plane that the<br/>
&gt;Plane of Hate will make the Plane of Fear look like a newbie zone.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;   &quot;During last night&#39;s event, the Plane of Hate &#39;opened up a gate and<br/>
&gt;&gt;let<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; forth it&#39;s minions&#39;.  It is not open as yet, however.  This is just a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; preview of things to come.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am almost sure that the plane is open for two reasons.  A GM mentioned<br/>
&gt;&gt;that the plane is open and the fact that Fennin Ro server has already<br/>
&gt;&gt;travelled to the zone.  Hopefully I am right, as it is due time that they<br/>
&gt;&gt;gave the level 50s somethign to do so they can level us level 20-30 alone<br/>
&gt;&gt;in our dungeons =)<br/>
