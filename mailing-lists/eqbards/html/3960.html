Subject: Warning about Accelerando<br/>
<br/>
There are mobs that can keep up with you with Accelerando<br/>
*with* a drum.<br/>
<br/>
I (L18 bard) was visiting Surefall Glade for the first time.  <br/>
All the NPCs gladly told me about the poacher problems so I<br/>
happily jaunted into the caves to rid them of the poacher<br/>
scourge. All the bears were green and threatening to me, but<br/>
didn&#39;t attack.  I finally ran across a huge bear - Mammoth -<br/>
who was yellow and threatening.  He immediately attacked me<br/>
(hey, thanks for the warning - real funny sending me on a<br/>
quest where the thing I&#39;m supposed to be protecting attacks<br/>
me).<br/>
<br/>
Mammoth is fast.  Very fast.  With Accelerando (my running<br/>
song) and a drum, I can (slowly) outrun druids and shamans<br/>
with Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t outrun Mammoth.<br/>
<br/>
He whacked me down to two bars of life (around 150/399, so<br/>
it&#39;s not like I tried to outrun him for just a few seconds - I<br/>
was doing a pretty good imitation of the pod race scene in the<br/>
Phantom Menace going through those caves at warp speed for a<br/>
good 20-30 seconds), at which point I knew there was no way<br/>
I&#39;d survive a trip to the zone with Mammoth in tow.  I figured<br/>
my best chance was to jump off a ledge and hope I&#39;d land in<br/>
water, which I did, and which happened.  This was my first<br/>
time in Surefall so I was now completely lost, with a mad bear<br/>
I couldn&#39;t outrun presumably pathfinding his way through the<br/>
twists and turns of the caves in the shortest possible<br/>
computer-generated route to decapitating me.  So I ran in any<br/>
old direction and ended up in a dead-end cave with a pool of<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to backtrack, I jumped in the water and swam.<br/>
There was a small underwater passage.  I figured the chances<br/>
that Mammoth, whom I&#39;d left far above, had somehow gotten<br/>
*below* me were slim, so I took the passage.  After a good<br/>
deal of swimming (my skill is around 85) I was about to start<br/>
drowning and realized this passage was not meant for mere<br/>
mortals.  Fortunately, I just happened to have the Aquatic<br/>
Ayre memorized, so I started it - end of drowning problem.<br/>
<br/>
The underwater passage went on for a really really long time -<br/>
I&#39;d guess about 4-5 times the time it normally takes you to<br/>
start drowning.  Finally I saw light and popped up in a room<br/>
behind the waterfall.  I kicked in Accelerando again and got<br/>
the Hell out of Surefall.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t go in the caves unless you&#39;re a druid or ranger.  :-)<br/>
