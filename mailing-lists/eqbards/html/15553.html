<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287724936">I was invis and trying to get to my friends in the king room<br/>
in Lower Guk last night.  I discovered two things.<br/>
<br/>
1.  The minotaur patriarch is green to me at level 47.<br/>
2.  The minotaur patriarch can see invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, three things.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The minotaur patriarch, even though he&#39;s green, can still<br/>
kick my butt in straight melee.<br/>
<br/>
I got several lucky high damage hits, and most of the<br/>
patriarch&#39;s hits had been misses or low damage.  We were both<br/>
at about 75% hp when he got several high damage hits in on me,<br/>
dropping me to 2 bubbles.  I&#39;d just had to zone and didn&#39;t<br/>
want to again, so I tried to think of a way out of this<br/>
situation using the songs I had loaded (no charm or Pixie<br/>
Strike).<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty close to the zone, so I settled on Chain,<br/>
Screech, Hymn with a lute, Niv&#39;s with a lute.  That would send<br/>
the patriarch running away from me while I healed up.  Fear<br/>
would wear off before Niv&#39;s, but Niv&#39;s would be up by the time<br/>
he was in range for me to chain him again.  I&#39;d have to take a<br/>
hit for the next Screech, but overall, it worked (slowly) and<br/>
I was able to get myself back up to 4 bubbles.  This took<br/>
enough time that the patriarch&#39;s damage shield wore off.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Then I did Chain/Screech and attacked him from behind.  When<br/>
he got to the bottom of the ramp, I&#39;d run back up and wait for<br/>
fear to expire.  Then repeat.  Eventually I got him to half,<br/>
at which point Chain rooted him in place.  I got myself a set<br/>
of azure sleeves from a mob I never thought I&#39;d be able to<br/>
solo.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re in an area of a dungeon where you know area<br/>
effect is safe, don&#39;t be afraid to use Screech.  The limited<br/>
duration is actually a blessing in dungeons, since with a<br/>
Chained/snared mob, it insures it won&#39;t get far enough to<br/>
aggro other things.<br/>
