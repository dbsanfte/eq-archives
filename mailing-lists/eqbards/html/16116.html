<div id="ygrps-yiv-71112669">Thats what I though from the beginning... I believe they are just fooling<br/>
people that are too curious. We have to learn how to adapt to our reality,<br/>
not stay all day complaining and dreaming with God like songs. We have a<br/>
hole bunch of songs that can do a hole bunch of different crap...<br/>

&gt;Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of fact<br/>
&gt;GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>
&gt;what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Besides.  I hate that people are even trying to figure this out already.<br/>
&gt;All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that may<br/>
&gt;or may not happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sheesh folks, it&#39;s a GAME, give me a break.  Yeah I&#39;m miffed that we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;missing 3 songs still.  Sure that irks me.  Do I care?  Not really, it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t make me any &#39;weaker&#39; as a Bard.  Will I be upset if they don&#39;t add<br/>
&gt;songs?  Yeah, but why should I borrow trouble that doesn&#39;t even exist yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Getting all worked up 6 weeks before the product comes out based on<br/>
&gt;information that isn&#39;t even *real* is silly.<br/>
