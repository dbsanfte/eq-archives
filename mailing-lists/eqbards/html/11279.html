&gt; Bah!  Not worthy?? BAH!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This reminds me of some clerics who say &quot;...only the tanks get symbol<br/>
&gt; buffs...&quot; Now what kinda logic is that?  Your casters have the lowest<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hp/ac<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and so who do you decide to help first?  The ones with the most hp/ac???<br/>
&gt; Pretty dumb is you ask me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not dumb at all.  Casters are the last ones who should get HP buffs.<br/>
Casters should do their best to avoid taking damage.  Let the tanks tank.<br/>
If the group is doing good, the monsters will never lay a hand on the<br/>
caster.<br/>
<br/>
Symbol takes a reagent.  The cost is 5gp up to 12pp for the higher level<br/>
buffs.  Buffing casters, who shouldn&#39;t be taking damage, is a serious drain<br/>
on a Cleric&#39;s resources.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels with Complete Heal, having a Symbol on a tank is even more<br/>
effective.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing dumb is saying always/never.  If you are trying to break a<br/>
spawn, or going through a dangerous area, then giving all members a Symbol<br/>
is a good idea.  Having a safety margin &quot;just in case&quot; is fine if you got<br/>
the mana and gems to spare.<br/>
