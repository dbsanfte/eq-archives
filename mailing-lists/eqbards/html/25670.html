I have also watched a movie, within sight of the computer, just in case,<br/>
while parked on a zone wall with it playing.<br/>
<br/>
Kunark zone walls aren&#39;t all that safe, but a lot of Antonica zone walls are<br/>
fairly safe, up high, in a corner.  You still want to keep an eye on it,<br/>
though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; trying to train up my brass skill, doesn&#39;t seem to work without a<br/>

&gt; &gt; places and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to increase my skill.<br/>

&gt;I have trained it in safe spots, it just goes up very very very slowly :o/<br/>
