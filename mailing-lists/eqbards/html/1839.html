&gt;Forget any, we should get med hands down....If any, let alone one song uses<br/>
&gt;mana, and alot if not all of it at that, we should be able to med.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The mana requirement was an elegant way to put a long delay<br/>
on reusing the song.  It is meant as a bard&#39;s version of lay on hands,<br/>
or sk&#39;s harm touch.  Only by limiting mana regen rates could<br/>
Verant get the delay up to the right amount.  Any other songs<br/>
they might create to use mana would be in the same class as<br/>
other classes special abilities that are mutually exclusive (monk&#39;s<br/>
special attacks, for instance.  Use one, and the are all unavailable<br/>
till the delay on that attack resets.)  For that reason, we will<br/>
NOT get mana regenerating benefits of meditate and 32.<br/>
