Subject: [eqbards] Ssra Temple<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
Yea, I still urk around here ;)<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were in Ssra Temple and ran into a<br/>
really wierd thing: Curse of Rah&#39;Vashagah (sp?)<br/>
<br/>
We moved into the right hall and were pulling mobs<br/>
from the water tunnel room.  Then we noticed that<br/>
something was draining our mana!  And then, it would<br/>
not go away!  We were lucky to be in a spot without<br/>
patrollers or respawn.  But we had no mana and no way<br/>
to regen it.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Sylly, with uber bardic melee and mad song skillz, promptly cleared<br/>
all mobs, and then using Melanies Melliflous Motion, got everyone in her<br/>
guild safely to the zone line!<br/>
<br/>
zzZZZZzzzz...***<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sorry...I&#39;m awake now.  Strange dream...I dreamt that bards were<br/>
somewhat powerful.  :P  hehe...j/k...it&#39;s friday!  :)<br/>
