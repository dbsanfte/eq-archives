&gt;I am looking for a real list that describes the actual effects of the <br/>
&gt;bard songs.  I am tired of +attack spd, +AC, dmg etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um - that&#39;s about as clear as most lists will get.  If you like you can<br/>
check out my list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/spellsongs.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/spellsongs.htm</a> - but<br/>
that&#39;s more RP oriented, and might confuse you more.  I really suggest the<br/>
list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rpgdungeon.com/">http://www.rpgdungeon.com/</a> or any of the lists that include a<br/>
review of the spell.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Chant of Battle <br/>
&gt;and Anthem de Arms are almost indestinguishable in effect as far as I <br/>
&gt;can tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is <br/>
&gt;better to use then the other.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anthem is MUCH better than Chant.  It&#39;s more noticeable in groups, but the<br/>
Anthem speeds up your attack speed - something Chant does not do.  Trust<br/>
me, tres valuable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Chord of Dissonance gives me no <br/>
&gt;indication of much much dmg I do and if I choose not to juggle then I <br/>
&gt;give up STR and AC to use it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Given a choice, I&#39;d burn Chords out of my songbook completely.  What a<br/>
waste above 10th.  At 12th, you should purchase, memorize and use the<br/>
Bellow.  It may not seem like much (max of 7hp per &quot;hit&quot;) but, first, that<br/>
adds up, and second, you can juggle it really nicely with the Anthem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Currently I have just taken to juggling between anthem, chant, and CoD <br/>
&gt;while wading into battle.  Just made 12th but have not purchased many <br/>
&gt;songs above 7th lvl.  Asside from healing (with mandolin) during or <br/>
&gt;after battle my groups have not been overly enthused about the bard <br/>
&gt;class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, first off, skip Chords completely from now on.  Use Anthem and<br/>
*something else* during combat, unless your team starts to get a bit<br/>
trashed.  If you can, back off, start the hymn to help heal a bit.  Before<br/>
combat, the Lament (used WITH instrument) is a VERY powerful tool indeed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One last note is it true that song 11 and 14 do not work.  If so that <br/>
&gt;really blows.  We only get 1 song a level (most of which are truely <br/>
&gt;useless I only use 4 songs now and I am 12th level for cripes sake and <br/>
&gt;now I get double screwed at 11 and 14th?!?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, but the way I understand it, everything that we&#39;re screwed on will get<br/>
fixed or replaced in the next 6 months.  And, just for comparisons sake,<br/>
I&#39;d like you to check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/enchantes.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/enchantes.htm</a> -<br/>
The Spellsongs for Bards in DragonRealms (a text-based massive mud)  This<br/>
game has been around for over 5 years, but look at how much they still<br/>
don&#39;t have working...  And people wonder why I left DR.<br/>
