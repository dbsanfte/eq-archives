<div id="ygrps-yiv-527865557">Hehe Talies, don&#39;t waste your time with Everlore.  Back when they were &#39;new&#39;<br/>
they were awesome.  But like everyone has said they do _no_ maintenance on<br/>
their databases and their search engine is terrible.  Keep your site on your<br/>
own pages.<br/>
<br/>
I personally deleted my Everlore bookmarks ages ago because the site is<br/>
worthless.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well if you decide against Everlore there is always Allakhazams site as<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; &gt;as the EQLizer site.  IMO those two are much better sites than Everlore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It wasn&#39;t that I was looking for hosting - it&#39;s that they offered, and the<br/>
&gt; offer of a custom-built database was pretty nice.  I&#39;m still witing to see<br/>
&gt; the contract before I decide.  Thanks for all the input, though - you guys<br/>
&gt; are very valuable =)<br/>
