<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, one thing I forgot. I have been dumping training points into Bind Wound<br/>
since the start and am really happy I did. At 60 or so it heals up to 15<br/>
over (I think) 3 ticks and really makes the first half of bad hurtin heal<br/>
quickly. When the fight ends I start Hymn, arm the mandolin, and start<br/>
bandaging. As the standing penalty is only 2/tick it&#39;s a pretty good<br/>
tradeoff. Also, a small oddity, while Hymn won&#39;t work, it turns out you can<br/>
bandage PvP+ players.<br/>
