<div id="ygrps-yiv-449893933">I would gladly pay that penalty.  I am much more likely to die trying to get<br/>
back, and if I wasn&#39;t a bard it would be even worse.  Of course when I am<br/>
30th level that won&#39;t be true anymore, but by then it will be moot as we<br/>
will have then equivalent of ressurection of some typ in our group.<br/>

:Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; <br/>
<br/>
Why not make a Bard bind song take away the equivalent exp from each player<br/>
to bind.  That would allow a person to get bound somewhere, but effectively<br/>
Lose the Exp equivalent to dying to get bound.  Id call that a penalty that<br/>
you would have to serious weigh.. They they would have to ask themselves,<br/>
which do I want? Lose EXP or Run 5 Zones?  Just a thought.</div>
