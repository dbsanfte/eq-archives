<div id="ygrps-yiv-860378823"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;When people ask me to play Jig to increase mana, I use a<br/>
&gt; &gt;condensed version of Talies explanation and they usually<br/>
&gt; &gt;accept it.  If they don&#39;t, their problem not mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone in my group<br/>
&gt; asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>
&gt; notion mind you) - I will happily do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, sometimes I play Jig so that is just LOOKS like their mana is<br/>
regenning faster. This way, they get the impression (either consciously or<br/>
subconsciously) that downtime is lessened when they group with me, thus<br/>
making them want to group with me in the future. =) Plus, what else am I<br/>
going to do if they&#39;re all healed? :P<br/>
<br/>
Also, some people are impressed with even the illusion that their mana is<br/>
regenning faster:<br/>
<br/>
Silly wizard: &quot;Wow, my mana is going up faster - what are you playing?&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Jig o Vigor. You&#39;re really not regenning mana faster overall - you&#39;re<br/>
just regenning less mana each tick, but the ticks are faster.&quot;<br/>
Silly wizard: &quot;Wow!!! Cool!!!&quot;<br/>
