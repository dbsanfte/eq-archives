zone.  I was referring to casters who ran back and forth or in<br/>
circles expecting you to get the mob off him.  If the caster<br/>
wants the mob off him, and he&#39;s not SoWed/mob is not snared,<br/>
he&#39;ll take just as much damage running around as he would<br/>
standing still.  Once you realize that, then it becomes a<br/>
simple problem of maximizing the ability of the other party<br/>
members to get the mob off you; and the best way to do that is<br/>
to stand still and back off in small increments.<br/>

Last night we took on the Maestro with 36 people.  When he<br/>
first got to us, somehow all the casters simultaneously<br/>
decided to nuke, and he was ping-ponged for about 1 minute.  <br/>
He took virtually no melee damage during that time, and<br/>
basically healed up all spell damage he took by using his AE<br/>
lifetap on the melee folks trying to chase him.  The battle<br/>
took an excessively long time (about 5-6 minutes).  Clerics<br/>
who had gone OOM were shouting requests for heals for group<br/>
members.  Towards the end a spite golem joined in, and it with<br/>
the Maestro wiped us out as all the clerics were OOM.  Only 2<br/>
people managed to camp.<br/>
<br/>
Take two.  30 minutes later, down to 32 people.  This time we<br/>
asked the casters to hold off for a minute to prevent the ping<br/>
ponging.  We pulled the Maestro, the melee folks started<br/>
whacking, a minute later the casters nuked (and the Maestro<br/>
didn&#39;t budge), and about 3 minutes later the Maestro was dead.  <br/>
Zero casualties, not a single shouted request for heals from<br/>
OOM clerics, and the clerics in my group finished at 60% and<br/>
80% mana.  It was obscene how much better we did by simply<br/>
letting the tanks hit the target.<br/>
