&gt; Some where there must be some kind of story buried deep in Norrath.  Going<br/>
&gt; thru some old screen shots, I uncovered this one (two actually.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There I was in South Qeynos buying up some milk and muffins where what did I<br/>
&gt; chance to see but a fight between some guards and some patrons of Fish&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Ale:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a couple of non corrupt guards in S Quenos that will<br/>
attack Trumpy. I remember in beta, somehow Trumpy and a guard ended up<br/>
fighting each other in the water under the docks. For some reason they<br/>
couldn&#39;t damage each other and they were stuck under there for at least<br/>
3 days.<br/>
