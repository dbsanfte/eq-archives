<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091887321">heh heh no problem man.  Tell everyone to hold off on mana and charm it.  18<br/>
seconds later you will never get it off ya.  I even convinced our enchanter<br/>
he could play wizard when needed and nuke away cause one pulse of charm kept<br/>
the mob on me or the taunter for the rest of the fight.<br/>

A related issue with bards and rangers grouped together.  I&#39;ve been grouped<br/>
with rangers a lot recently using snare/fear in the Overthere.  It works<br/>
quite well at taking down mobs with little risk to the group.  The only<br/>
problem is that the ranger (high 30s) takes all the damage if the mob<br/>
resists fear and starts attacking us.  I know the ranger is inflicting more<br/>
melee damage than me but the fear song is supposed to have a high taunt<br/>
factor.  You would think that after hitting a mob with fear constantly over<br/>
several rounds I would piss them off some.  Not so.  In a bad combat with<br/>
multiple fear resists, the ranger will often be at half health while I will<br/>
still be at almost full health.  I&#39;ve even tried weaving in Hymn to try and<br/>
move myself up the hate list in order to get the mob to attack me and spread<br/>
out damage some.  That doesn&#39;t work either.  I can see why a lot of rangers<br/>
have been complaining about this recently.  I guess its a step in the right<br/>
direction that they are getting a spell to move them down the hate list.<br/>
They probably need it a lot earlier than they are getting it though.<br/>

The new songs for hybrids referred to the Ranger hate lowering song I<br/>
believe.  Wasn&#39;t aware any other hybrids got more songs.  <br/>
<br/>
Gotta love that one.  They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they screwed up by<br/>
not increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face they give Rangers<br/>
a spell to lower their hate list factor.  So much for Symphonic Harmony<br/>
being unique to bards.<br/>

Why is it, all it takes is a patch where they don&#39;t tell us things that we<br/>
instantly find out anyway, to make me cynical once again. <br/>
There was also some talk last night of new hybrid spells available from<br/>
vendors.  I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>
being literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>
