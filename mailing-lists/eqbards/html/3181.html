<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166110958">What about simply &quot;playing&quot; ??<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
&quot;There´┐¢I was in lower guk.... playing Chant and Chords when the &lt;insert big<br/>
monster name here&gt; spawns so I target him and hit attack!´┐¢ Sylly punches &lt;a<br/>
big monster&gt; for 1 point of damage!´┐¢ Oh no I have forgotten to equip a wep<br/>
yet again!!!&quot;´┐¢ <br/>

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT<br/>

For some reason, we think we need a special term that connotes using 2 or<br/>
more songs at the same time -- yet the connotaion´┐¢would be redundant since<br/>
we always say which ones we are combining.´┐¢ So &quot;playing&quot; followed by which<br/>
ones they are are says it all.´┐¢ For variety, any of the other words are nice<br/>
synonyms.´┐¢ But none of them add any more meaning that simply &quot;playing.&quot;<br/>

´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ Come on people - we should be more creative that just coming up with two<br/>
ideas!<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ My apologies if anyone takes this personally, but, I think &quot;Juggling&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Weaving&quot; are just as bad (well maybe slightly less so) than<br/>
&quot;Twisting&quot;.´┐¢ I&#39;m not a clown; I&#39;m not a textile worker as well as not being<br/>
a gymnast.´┐¢ I&#39;m a musician.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ The term I like: &quot;Riffing&quot;...´┐¢ It seems to me - that we are playing five<br/>
or six seconds of a song - so it would basically just be a riff...´┐¢<br/>
Musically speaking, of course, &quot;riffs&quot; are associated more with instrumental<br/>
music than vocal music - but I think it fits a hell of a lot better than<br/>
twisting, juggling, weaving, or heaven-forbid &quot;medlying&quot;<br/>
