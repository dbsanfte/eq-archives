<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064120140">I was all excited about my newbie bard buying a Lizard scale cloak (7AC, +5<br/>
dex)for about 80pp which Tszaaz had done long ago. I see they are now around<br/>
300pp. They USED to be the junk loot for Rubicite campers, are they now the<br/>
rare drop? *heavy sigh* <br/>
That is depressing...<br/>
