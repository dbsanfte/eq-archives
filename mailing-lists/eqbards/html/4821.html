8)My first night as level 20 and I went to HighHold Keep.  Got<br/>
8)into a group<br/>
8)with others ranging to 27 with me the lowest most of the<br/>
8)time.  There was an<br/>
8)enchanter with us for a while and most of the time we had 3<br/>
8)and 4 who could<br/>
8)tank and cast (Pallidins, Cleric, Warrior mid 20&#39;s all)<br/>
8)<br/>
8)At any rate, the mobs (Pickclaws) were all red or deep red to<br/>
8)me with an<br/>
8)occasional yellow.  I noticed that I could only do like 2 and<br/>
8)3 dmg to the<br/>
8)deep reds (with dragoon dirk and barbed leather whip) and so<br/>
8)I decided to<br/>
8)step back from the melee and equip the drum.  I played<br/>
8)Anthem, Guardian and<br/>
8)tossed in Bellow when able.  I was getting pretty good at<br/>
8)keeping the 2 buff<br/>
8)icons on the screen most of the time.  I really wish Verant<br/>
8)would give us<br/>
8)bards an automatic &quot;have a good exciting fight but kill the<br/>
8)monster and win&quot;<br/>
8)key.  That way I could get pizza and soda during long fights. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Mmm.... pizza..... Talk about long fights, last night a spent a solid hour<br/>
and a half running aviaks in south karana. As I run along I would pass by<br/>
another that would tag along behind me. Had 8 trying to catch me at one<br/>
time. Had to eventually zone with a few cause nature called...<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Ok, sorry - was just kidding.  My questions are:<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Should I have been using Chant instead of Anthem? I tried to<br/>
8)compare stats<br/>
8)one time and they looked real close.  Chant with the drum and<br/>
8)Guardian with<br/>
8)the drum both are enhanced.<br/>
<br/>
	Generally you would want to use the Anthem. Even though it doesn&#39;t boost as<br/>
many stats it will increase the party&#39;s attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Looks like Anthem is not enhanced by an instrument - true or<br/>
8)false? (Ok, I<br/>
8)just checked myself and the chart says &#39;singing&#39; so that<br/>
8)means no help from<br/>
8)any instruments.)  I guess it&#39;s Anthem if you are in the<br/>
8)melee - otherwise<br/>
8)is Chant any better if you are drumming for other songs as well?<br/>
<br/>
	Yes, Anthem is singing only. And again I would play it over Chant<br/>
regardless if I was in the fray or not.<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Is it a bad idea to use AE songs in High Keep?  For example -<br/>
8)could I have<br/>
8)used Largo&#39;s to slow their attack speeds?  Or would I have<br/>
8)met all kinds of<br/>
8)new monsters from Area Effects?<br/>
<br/>
	Can&#39;t comment on this one since each place has it&#39;s unique traits in terms<br/>
of layout. If you can fight in a room that is somewhat isolated and is not a<br/>
major thouroughfare then some AE songs could work. If anything I might try<br/>
Lullaby or Discord.<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)If a red mob resists the bellow - is it worth it to try again<br/>
8)or does one<br/>
8)resist mean that they will always resist?  Does how badly<br/>
8)damaged the mob<br/>
8)matter?  Say you see a resist in the top half of his health -<br/>
8)so wait til<br/>
8)he&#39;s under 50% hp before trying another?<br/>
<br/>
	Usually I try about 5 times. If it resists all of them then I just go with<br/>
buffing the party. As far as how badly damaged it is, I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
anything to indicate that.<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)It was the first (maybe second) time I was in a full party with higher<br/>
8)levels doing the tanking and we were fighting mobs that were<br/>
8)virtually all<br/>
8)red to me. Half the reds resisted my bellows consistently.<br/>
8)It didn&#39;t seem<br/>
8)like I was contributing much with pierce for 2 points of<br/>
8)damage and taking<br/>
8)the occasional hit for 32 points of damage. So, I stepped<br/>
8)back from the<br/>
8)melee and played some songs with instruments.<br/>
<br/>
	One other thing that is important to consider is that the 32 point it did<br/>
to you was 32 points less it did to your tanks. If one person takes all the<br/>
damage then the entire party is healing one point per tick. If the damage is<br/>
distributed evenly amongst 6 members then the party is healing 6 points per<br/>
tick. Multiply out at will if singing the Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Most of my experience has been with a partner and we both<br/>
8)gotta melle.  Or<br/>
8)me as tank and 2 casters doing the nuking.  Or full party&#39;s but more<br/>
8)co-level and all but the casters are in the melee because we<br/>
8)don&#39;t have<br/>
8)&#39;real&#39; tanks. So have some fighters with big swords was a new and<br/>
8)interesting experience. I spent the whole night in a room<br/>
8)full of reds when<br/>
8)I can&#39;t survive a camp of greens &lt;g&gt;<br/>
