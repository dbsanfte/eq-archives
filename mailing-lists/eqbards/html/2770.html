&gt; &gt; I have the lute, and did not notice any difference when i <br/>
&gt; first gotten it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; though i have not tested recently.  You never know it could <br/>
&gt; have an effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the future, so its good to have.  I heard the battle <br/>
&gt; drum you get from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore has an increased percussion effect too, but I do <br/>
&gt; not have it yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A friend of mine got the drum last night but sold it before I<br/>
&gt; had a chance to test it.  270pp (yes, two hundred and seventy<br/>
&gt; platinum).  It was enough for him to drop what he was doing,<br/>
&gt; and hop the boat over to deliver the drum to the purchaser. <br/>
&gt; Maybe it *does* have an increased effect.<br/>
