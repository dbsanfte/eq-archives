&gt; -- imagine, wasting time on &quot;fixing&quot; this, while<br/>
&gt; there are things like ~deadly~ pathing bugs to worry about.--<br/>
&gt; &lt;end snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would think that an animation is an art bug whereas a <br/>
&gt; pathing bug is quite<br/>
&gt; likely to fall to a programmer, which given the fact that the <br/>
&gt; expansion is<br/>
&gt; due out in a while they probably doesn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>
&gt; time(like we ever do)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although why an artist would be told to fix this instead of <br/>
&gt; creating some<br/>
&gt; new graphics for some of the armour we&#39;ll never know, <br/>
&gt; probably a trainee<br/>
&gt; artist given the why the animation looks :) <br/>
&gt; Hopefully they get it right next time ^,^<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I know that there was a big complaint sounded to &quot;fix the drum&quot;<br/>
animation when EQ first started. Looks like they finally are getting around<br/>
to it, but we still don&#39;t have a drum picture. Doesn&#39;t really matter to me<br/>
as long as I&#39;m still running as fast as I was. It&#39;ll just take a little<br/>
getting used to.<br/>
<br/>
As for new graphics for armor, I doubt they&#39;ll provide different looking<br/>
armor types except in the expansion. Verant&#39;s put in a lot of effort to<br/>
minimize the different &quot;looks&quot; of armor out there and basically take the<br/>
armor that is already in the game, and &quot;colorize&quot; it to represent different<br/>
types. The banded armor for Half Elf is also used for &quot;blackened&quot; armor. The<br/>
&quot;bronze&quot; armor is used for Mithril/Lambent/Plate (probably barnacle) and I<br/>
believe Imbrued.<br/>
