<div id="ygrps-yiv-85762123">I can possibly see how they could miss this. Who would think to sell these<br/>
things back to a vendor when they are mainly to be used to get quest items.<br/>
Especially on the test server where there are probably not enough people to<br/>
find this out (or the people who found this out waited till the patch came<br/>
down to make mega cash like the pie tin sketch incident). They also almost<br/>
slipped up on the Shin Gauntlets. Trying to sell them to a vendor will get<br/>
you a price of 432 plat but the vendors won&#39;t buy them...<br/>
	Incidentally, anyone know where Greater Dark Bone Skeletons spawn? I&#39;d<br/>
*really* like a pair of the bracers and I&#39;ve never heard of these things<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)This is the kind of thing you would expect Verant to discover<br/>
8)before they<br/>
8)implemented the quests.  I fail to see how lack of paying attention to<br/>
8)detail on their part can be considered an exploit.<br/>

8)&gt; Actually, as I understand it, the reason that Genni<br/>
8)disappeared was that<br/>
8)&gt; she was shut down due to<br/>
8)&gt; an exploit.  You could buy fire opals from her for 55 plat,<br/>
8)then turn<br/>
8)&gt; around and sell them to a<br/>
8)&gt; vendor for a profit!  So GMs shut them down.<br/>
