<b>Subject:</b> Luini - weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640762039">That&#39;s a great topic - what weapon should a bard roleplay? I suddenly feel<br/>
guilty about my Mino Axe - Luini has a great point. Before EQ, I always<br/>
thought the bard to be far more roguish than warriorish. After all, they<br/>
struggle in the streets, searching for musical success, they linger about in<br/>
bawdy bars, and are generally lounge-abouts. <br/>
<br/>
If you think in this vein, perhaps something more like a dagger is<br/>
appropriate. I find the giant snake fang works well, but seems a little<br/>
&quot;crude&quot; from a roleplay standpoint. <br/>
<br/>
In swords, I find the bastard sword might be a worthy choice for roleplay,<br/>
but not that great for combat. It seems to me axes wouldn&#39;t really be a good<br/>
roleplay choice - they&#39;re cumbersome, have exposed blades (usually) and are<br/>
&quot;aggressive&quot; weapons (a sword/staff can be used for sparring and parrying,<br/>
but an axe is built to rip skin). I think a bard, who probably doesn&#39;t get<br/>
fulfillment from combat, rather from performing, and carousing, would carry<br/>
an unobtrusive weapon.<br/>
<br/>
I realize I didn&#39;t truly answer the question, but with EQ, we must choose -<br/>
do you want to use a weapon for roleplay? Or for combat effectiveness?<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to ask the inevitable - why is it that bards can wear plate,<br/>
chain and even banded? How can ANYONE play an instrument in that attire? I<br/>
know when my comrades perform in public they switch to less combative<br/>
apparel. But I wonder if the bard is a class that was fully thought out by<br/>
the creators of EQ...<br/>
<br/>
More questions than answers,<br/>

Greetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>
Soebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>
a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>
with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>
slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>
sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>
switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>
you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>
level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Luini<br/>
