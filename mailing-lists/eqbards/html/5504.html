<div id="ygrps-yiv-557714819">Strangely enough, something SIMILAR happened to me.  I<br/>
logged on with my Cleric (lev 25) one day about 3<br/>
weeks ago (before my vacation) and I found that<br/>
everything in my bank account was missing (a few<br/>
hundred plat, several items, and all my lev 29<br/>
spells).  I /petitioned a GM...waited, did so<br/>
again....waited for a few hours...yes HOURS, and did<br/>
so ONCE AGAIN.  I got a guide, but I figured that<br/>
would do.  I explained the situation to him, and he<br/>
responded that there was nothing he, or any GM<br/>
could/would do (as I still had the items that I was<br/>
wearing).  Verant will not replace individual items,<br/>
or items in the bank.  you WILL get replacement gear,<br/>
but it is crap that is no-drop and sure to be much<br/>
worse than you had.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck, and sorry to hear someone else is having<br/>
problems.  I found it to be quite irksome.<br/>
