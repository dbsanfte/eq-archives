 </span></blockquote>Constantly singing Fulfil&#39;s is pointless since the song lasts<br/>
10-15 seconds.  You can sing it with two others.  It&#39;s Bellow<br/>
that you have to sing constantly if you want continuous<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used Fulfil&#39;s when I had an enchanter, druid, and two<br/>
rangers in the group (enchanter doing crowd control and speed<br/>
debuffs, three people on snare duty).  Most of the mobs were<br/>
melee mobs so when I didn&#39;t need to play resist songs.  I used<br/>
Chant, Celerity, and Fulfil&#39;s.  With the enchanter doing crowd<br/>
control, we were only being attacked by one mob at a time,<br/>
which reduced the value of a damage shield.<br/>
<br/>
Then the druid started tossing starfires with regen and a<br/>
manastone, and I switched to Celerity, Hymn, Clarity.  :)<br/>
