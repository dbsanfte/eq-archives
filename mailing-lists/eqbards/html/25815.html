<div id="ygrps-yiv-969285086">Twisting is a skill that develops over the course of your character.  Most people don&#39;t want to put that much effort into gameplay and I think that is why you don&#39;t have a lot of high level bards.  Personally I think VI should code in an extended notes ability for bards above say, level 55, but that&#39;s just me P<br/>
I can twist four songs (barring missed notes) but I find it a lot of work over the course of an entire evening -- I prefer to twist three as I find more opportunity to at least read the group and guild chat.  On raids I have missed important drops because I was twisitng and not watching for loot that way ... Five songs?  If you do the math, you&#39;ll see that this doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
Amplification and charm last long enough to extend your twists but those are special songs and I probably wouldn&#39;t use them together.<br/>
BoH does a free song for you, so does some singing steel.  Epic procs are also sometimes confused with songs.  Sounds to me like a bard who was marketing himself to a group. <br/>

Sitting around with some RL friends who play everquest, and suddenly one of <br/>
them says &quot;by the way, your bard sucks now.&quot;  &quot;Eh?&quot; I say.  &quot;Yeah, we <br/>
played with a bard the other night, 58, who kept 4 songs going most of the <br/>
fight and said when things get tough he twists in a fifth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this BS?  Or do i really suck.  When I have a good connection and low <br/>
lag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>
<br/>
I have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here?  Should I set up hotkeys so that one casts two <br/>
songs with appropriate delays?  I&#39;ve never like that idea because it gives <br/>
me less flexibility... but now I begin to wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Or is this bs...<br/>
<br/>
Very curious to hear what y&#39;all have to say<br/>
