  I dunno. hehe.  I think it&#39;s sitting.  I don&#39;t know, I rarely play<br/>
  Hymm anymore, it&#39;s not practical.  Between straight manasong and<br/>
  a party of hybrids and healer, we can completely heal everyone <br/>
  after battle, and I don&#39;t have to bother with twisting which is<br/>
  a lot of spam.<br/>
