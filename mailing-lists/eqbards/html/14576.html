<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127995377">Agreed.  On the last raid the two magicians there were constantly summoning<br/>
waterstones in between fights.  Everyone had these hotkeyed in their main<br/>
inventory for quick access.  Another option is the Fish Gill Extract potion.<br/>
I think they run around 12PP each.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The fish there do drop scales, but not enough for you to rely solely<br/>
&gt; on them, IMHO.  Fish scales can be purchased in bulk from one of the<br/>
&gt; merchants near Inn 3 in the east commonlands (bat wings too).  A good<br/>
&gt; idea would be to have a magician summon a couple of the appropriate<br/>
&gt; rings or stones for everyone who doesn&#39;t have a Fishbone Earring or<br/>
&gt; an Aqualung or a Rebreather.  That way they have something ready in<br/>
&gt; case of an emergency.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; I can&#39;t answer your question about bulk purchases but I do know a lot<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the fishes you kill in Kedge drop fish scales so it shouldn&#39;t be hard<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rangers/druids to replenish their supplies while they are down there.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; &gt;     The talk of Kedge Keep has me very interested and my Guild Leader<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been planning an outing on ICQ.  The question is; short of<br/>
&gt; fishing;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; where can Fish Scales be purchased in bulk?<br/>
