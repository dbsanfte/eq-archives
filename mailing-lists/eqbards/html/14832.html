&gt; Would like an opinion from the peanut gallery if I should keep the Exe Hood<br/>
&gt; for future use.  Eventually I hope to acquire Ykeshas so the +9 DEX from the<br/>
&gt; Exe Hood will increase the chances of the Ykesha procing.  The key question<br/>
&gt; is that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early 40s), will the +9<br/>
&gt; DEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the benefit of having<br/>
&gt; +5 to all resist rates? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The effect of dex on procs is pretty hotly debated.  Most<br/>
folks agree it does help, but not as to the degree to which it<br/>
helps.  I guess this can be my next pet project.  Should be<br/>
pretty easy as it&#39;s independent of mob, speed buffs, hit%,<br/>
etc (at least I hope it is :).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, you can camp the ghoul lord with a high 30s/low 40s group<br/>
and hold the room, but if the lord shows up with a sword, you<br/>
will all die.  :)  Two groups that level could do it though.  <br/>
Make sure someone has jig or invigor memorized because it&#39;s a<br/>
*long* fight.<br/>
