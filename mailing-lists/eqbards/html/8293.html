&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Travelling to Lower Guk to get a Guise<br/>

&gt;Yesterday Kitasi and I discussed going to Lower Guk and purchasing the<br/>
&gt;looting rights from a group that was camping the spawn that drops the Guise<br/>
&gt;of the Deceiver.  To recap, I have never killed a live froglok so they are<br/>
&gt;not KOS towards me.  In theory, that combined with the invis song will <br/>
&gt;allow<br/>
&gt;me to go through Upper Guk safely.  However, once I get into Lower Guk the<br/>
&gt;undead frogloks will still attack me.  I discussed my plan with my<br/>
&gt;guildmembers last night and some of them told me that even with Invis to<br/>
&gt;Undead, my chances of safely going to Lower Guk to loot a Guise were not<br/>
&gt;good.  I was told told that the undead frogloks can sometimes see through<br/>
&gt;Invis to Undead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Getting through upper guk should be possible even without invisibility if <br/>
you have never killed a frog before. I do it all the time with my low level <br/>
druid.<br/>
<br/>
Just FYI, waiting around by the zone line is NOT safe in the deadside of <br/>
lower Guk. People are constantly training monsters of all types there. The <br/>
main problem - if you are attacked by a ghoul there is a chance you will be <br/>
rooted. If you get rooted, you probably will be running back to get your <br/>
corpse shortly after. Course this all depends on who you are with.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Invis vs Undead  is concerned, I have yet to experience any of the <br/>
undead SEEING THROUGH my invisibility (maybe some of the ghoul wizards <br/>
possibly might be able to)...however, just like ANY invisibility spell, it&#39;s <br/>
very unreliable. It can easily wear off at the wrong time, and I&#39;ve seen <br/>
this happen too many times to count. Just make sure you avoid vampire bats, <br/>
deadly black widows, and gargoyles.<br/>

&gt;directions I should take?  Invis to undead doesn&#39;t last very long so thats <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;big factor.  Would I have time to run back to the zone border if attacked<br/>
&gt;while looting?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way to get to wear the mask is dropped is hard to explain. It would be <br/>
best to follow an experienced person there. If you are lucky you will make <br/>
it alive. If you get trained anywhere after the bedroom you will probably <br/>
not make it out unless you get Succored.<br/>
