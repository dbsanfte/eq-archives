<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433936384">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
 Has anyone ever figured out what the various instrument pieces sold by<br/>
vendors are used for? There were parts for a trumpet sold in old Norrath<br/>
(NRo/EC?), in FV there are what appear to be flute and lute pieces, also a<br/>
lute tuner was added in Freeport.<br/>
