&gt;<br/>
&gt; My point is that a class whose specialty is supposed to be<br/>
&gt; healing is better at combat than we are.  I suppose you could<br/>
&gt; argue that we&#39;re not supposed to be very good at combat<br/>
&gt; either, but still I&#39;d like to be better than the class whose<br/>
&gt; purpose is anti-killing.<br/>

Just to clear up any misconceptions here are the Cleric DD spells<br/>
Lvl - Dam/mana - Name<br/>
1  - 10/12 - Strike<br/>
5  - 19/20 - Furor<br/>
14 - 83/70 - Smite<br/>
29 - 200/145 - Wrath<br/>
44 - 510/240 - Resolution<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, these are some of the worst DD spells in the game.  And<br/>
after level 14, there is a 15 level gap before an improvement.  The levels<br/>
just before a spell upgrade are the hardest, as you are using spells from 14<br/>
levels ago.  I do believe that Clerics are positioned just about right for<br/>
DD spells, as they do have better defence compared to all other pure<br/>
casters.  There are some sweet spots just after they get a new spell where<br/>
they can solo somewhat, but there are dead spots where they are very<br/>
ineffective with DD spells.<br/>

Here was the original message I replied to:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a result, [hybrids] get magic<br/>
&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
&gt; other hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
&gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, instead of arguing about the battle worthness of a Bard I should have<br/>
just used your own argument against you.  The level 14 song was a pure<br/>
caster type song.  Only pure casters got the identify spell.  You felt that<br/>
bards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>
from all other classes without binding.  I mean MAJOR UPROAR.  So it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter what kind of Vulcan logic you use to argue that Bards need binding it<br/>
won&#39;t happen.  Putting BardBind in your petition will do no good at all, and<br/>
probably cause Verant to not fully consider the rest of your petition.<br/>
<br/>
What you need to ask for is to have all classes be able to bind anywhere (or<br/>
maybe just Inns) they choose instead of just a city.  Verant is much more<br/>
likely to consider something that would be fair to all classes, and not just<br/>
for Bards.<br/>
