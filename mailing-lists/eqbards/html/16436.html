<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528283235">heh heh for me I&#39;d rather they snare as a mob approaches 50%.  We have this<br/>
problem of letting DoT&#39;s do their full damage and many of our fights last 2<br/>
mins.  Heck we had a stupid darkness snare wear off on a goblin last nite<br/>
and it was ugly.  The necro even admitted he was lazy by just hitting the<br/>
mob once with the slowdown and then not giving it a second thought that<br/>
after 2 minutes it probably wasn&#39;t slowed again.  I am lucky though in that<br/>
both the druids and ranger that I group with are snare happy if anything.<br/>
No one would accuse them of being snare lazy that&#39;s for sure!  My guess is<br/>
you aren&#39;t snare lazy either Faerain!<br/>

&gt;There&#39;s nothing &quot;only&quot; about getting a bard to level 34.  That&#39;s hard work.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;When there&#39;s a good snarer in the group I let them work, but as was<br/>
&gt;mentioned earlier a lot of them have gotten really lazy.  They cast once at<br/>
&gt;the beginning and then again when the mob runs.  Hell, just let me chain<br/>
&gt;them and save the mana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay. You say casting once at the beginning then again when the mob<br/>
runs makes the druid lazy.<br/>
<br/>
What would make a snarer NOT lazy? (realizing that even Snare takes mana)<br/>
Do you want them to set a timer and snare every 30 seconds? Every 60<br/>
seconds?<br/>
<br/>
What do you expect out of your snarer to not call them lazy?<br/>
