<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891329125">I am almost always the tank in my group. I take the damage, everyone else<br/>
dishes it out. Everything attacks me anyways, so I might as well just jump<br/>
in there and help out. Full platemail and good agility means that when<br/>
things hit me, they don&#39;t do much damage. Even sand giants seem to miss<br/>
about 80% of the time, and I&#39;m only level 30.<br/>
<br/>
The heal song is almost useless in battle. You heal far far far less damage<br/>
than you could dish out by arming weapons and singing the bellow. (Or<br/>
anthem for those of you who think it works well).<br/>
<br/>
Another great bard tanking method comes when fighting multiple mobs at the<br/>
same time. In this case, I always play Denon&#39;s. it does about 25 - 30<br/>
damage (that&#39;s an estimate) per tick PER mob. So not only are you dishing<br/>
out 70 damage per tick, but your group can concentrate on one mob while the<br/>
you tank the other two. <br/>
