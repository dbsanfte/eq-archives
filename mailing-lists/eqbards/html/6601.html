<div id="ygrps-yiv-979569134">No, the problem is that many people are dead before they even completely load<br/>
into the zone.  The agro range of the mobs there is extremely large and there<br/>
is no buffer whatsoever between where you zone in and the toughest mobs up<br/>
there.  There is often a latency of many seconds between the time that you<br/>
appear in a zone and the time that you are actually given control of the<br/>
character.  This is killing many, many players.  Discussion on the Guide board<br/>
has addressed this, and ideas has been forwarded to the Senior Guides and<br/>
hopefully to the Developers.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right - Fear, Air, Hate, etc. should be very difficult.  Whether it<br/>
should be more difficult than taking out Nagefen or Vox, I dunno...<br/>

&gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider it a<br/>
&gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for those<br/>
&gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.  It<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a new<br/>
&gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>
