<b>Subject:</b> Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-928667042">There really isn&#39;t a good way to do this.   If you&#39;re pulling, you&#39;ll be<br/>
taking faction hits.  There really isn&#39;t any way around it.<br/>
<br/>
You will rarely be getting single mobs.  Half of the mobs are unmezable.<br/>
If it takes your entire force over 30 seconds to kill a single normal<br/>
mob...thats, um, bad.  I&#39;m not an enchanter, but mem blur appears to take<br/>
several casts, and they never seem to know if it worked.<br/>
<br/>
PoG can be pretty fun.   If you want to be a puller, good for you.   But<br/>
realistically, don&#39;t expect to do it without faction consequences.<br/>

&gt; Was wondering if there is any way for a bard to serve as main puller in PoG<br/>
&gt; without taking a negative Tunare faction hit? From what I have read, a lot<br/>
&gt; of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in PoG in order to<br/>
&gt; lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for us to remain<br/>
&gt; non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun since we could both<br/>
&gt; scout and pull.<br/>
&gt; I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to cast mem blur on<br/>
&gt; the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option would be for the<br/>
&gt; bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. This would work<br/>
&gt; assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the mob. Anyone<br/>
&gt; know if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>
&gt; In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up playing mana<br/>
&gt; battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but getting to be main<br/>
&gt; scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>
