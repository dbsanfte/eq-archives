&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: Increases resistance to cold-based spells. Not much <br/>
&gt;use has been found for this yet. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alright, ive yet to find out why nobody has posted any information about <br/>
this song. In addition to cold based protection, it acts as a fireshield for <br/>
everybody in the group. Everytime a monster hits you, they get damage done <br/>
to them, at lvl 40 the damage is 6. Great song while fighting multiple <br/>
monsters, and is in someways better than discord since it doesnt concentrate <br/>
all the monsters energy on you, since its not you thats doing the damage to <br/>
them, its the person that they are hitting :). It also seems to give <br/>
infravision erratically, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt, not too <br/>
sure about that part. But the damage shield is for sure. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: Will cause all monsters in its path to flee in <br/>
&gt;terror, but only for about a minute or so, then they will come back. This is <br/>
&gt;a useful song if your party is trying to run, but failing, or if a party <br/>
&gt;member, unable to run, is about to die. This is an area effect Fear spell, <br/>
&gt;mentioned as a &quot;get out of death free&quot; song, if used at the right time. Just <br/>
&gt;make sure that your party zones after using this song to avoid problems when <br/>
&gt;fear wears off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually its most usefull when fighting outdoors with another bard or <br/>
somebody that can ensnare. That way the mob is always fleeing at a very slow <br/>
rate and unable to attack you, while you get hit, after hit, after hit on <br/>
its backside. <br/>

pick it up, but i suspect it does and im eager to go get it. <br/>

pull for yourself<br/>
later. Unfortunatly you are going to be playing the chorus of clarity or <br/>
healing song then so you dont get too use it much. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Notes: Warning: area effect song<br/>
&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s <br/>
&gt;duration) and drops<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fire Resistance 14 points (at 48th level), if you use a drum. Without a drum,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Fire Resistance by 14. Stacks <br/>
&gt;nicely with all other DOT songs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This might just be me, but i cant for the life of me get this song to work <br/>
as an aoe song. Its single target only from what i can tell. <br/>
