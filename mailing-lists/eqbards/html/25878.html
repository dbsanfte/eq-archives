(Gasp!! I&#39;m a woman & I&#39;m interested in &quot;D&D&quot;<br/>
type games... whoa, wait a minute... my main is<br/>
also a warrior... I bet this guy would think this<br/>
says something about MY sexuality. Maybe I<br/>
secretly want to be a man... lol... I think<br/>
not!!)<br/>

Im not sure if you are referring to me or the author of the article, but I<br/>
have nothing against women playing eq, I&#39;m all for it, wish I could get my<br/>
wife to play, but alas, its not gonna happen. I was just saying that I know<br/>
many people have had social problems due to eq, for example I know a guy<br/>
back on sol ro that lost his job, his wife and sold his jaguar so that he<br/>
could play eq (moron).  Even myself sometimes the wife faction drops due to<br/>
playing hours, those 3-6 hours raids are painful, I only do those when she&#39;s<br/>
working. But I also know where to draw the line. Real life is more important<br/>
to me then phat gear. And you being into D&D games, I envy ya, I wish my<br/>
wife was too, but she&#39;s not much into that era/medieval stuff, she more<br/>
high-fi.  If ya met someone in eq then I wish ya nothing but good times, but<br/>
I know that many have suffered more then people who have gained.  But there<br/>
are lotsa &quot;interesting people playing eq, and this topic has come up on the<br/>
Ayonae Ro boards. Its rather pathetic how some people act online.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the eq boxes, they&#39;re a joke to me, i remember one time i bought one<br/>
and brought it into the office instead of leaving it in the car, so I could<br/>
read the manual or something during the afternoon (beats playin freecell)<br/>
and a lady in my department made a comment something of the sort &quot;oh i bet<br/>
you really like that outfit blah blah blah&quot;.  It really pissed me off, i<br/>
just looked at her and told her very sarcasticly something like  &quot;ya they<br/>
really get me going&quot;. Come on people, I been playin since beta 3, before<br/>
that it was uo.  I  play cause I like rpg stuff, not cause some dork artist<br/>
doest get out of the office enough. <br/>
<br/>
Check this thread out, it pretty much sums it up...<br/>
