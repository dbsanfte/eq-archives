<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161000752">I&#39;ve had that problem for as long as I&#39;ve had Pixie.  Some times I have<br/>
lots of success (once held a frog shaman and an icebone for 30s while<br/>
my root wore off) and sometimes I have 75%+ resist rates.  I was chain<br/>
striking last night to augment a 2 paladin 1 cleric stun session to<br/>
keep cenobites from healing.  I got so many resists that, had it not<br/>
been for the cenos, I&#39;d remove it from my list.  I find it working<br/>
nicely on low blues and greens, that&#39;s it.  131cha w/ & w/o mino horn<br/>
it chows.<br/>

&gt; Anyone notice a change in Pixie Strike?  I have used it before and<br/>
&gt; gotten<br/>
&gt; resisted quite a bit, but last night was the first time I ever saw<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; secondary resist message like Lullaby has.  Was this added at the<br/>
&gt; same time<br/>
&gt; as Lullaby&#39;s was or later?  It was taking me 3-4 applications to get<br/>
&gt; it to<br/>
&gt; stick which made it useless for mezzing casters.  <br/>
