<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820846033">Speaking of Song taunting, I had an interesting experience last nite.  I was<br/>
in North Karana watching for the gnome watchman to spawn when some idiot<br/>
decided an unannounced Hill Giant train into the stone bridge watchtower<br/>
would be a good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
There were about a half dozen of us in there, 4 medding&#39; casters a warrior<br/>
healing up, and me sitting and innocently singing Acellerando in the corner.<br/>
In tromps the HG, smashes its prey to the ground just as it reaches the exit<br/>
onto the bridge where it is immediately surrounded by guards.  I&#39;m standing<br/>
up at this point. <br/>
<br/>
The HG bashes two of the guards once each as they pummel it, Captain<br/>
Linarius alone is doing over 100 per hit.  Everything seemed fine at this<br/>
point...<br/>
<br/>
Then Acellerando pulsed.  The HG immediately ran over the 4 guards who had<br/>
at this point done over 600 hp&#39;s to it, past 2 of the medding casters and<br/>
the warrior who had just stood up, right to me.  He immediately began<br/>
bashing my brains out.  His first smack stunned my Accelerando off, so as I<br/>
started to run I tried starting it up again.  The HG was happily bashing<br/>
guards again as I reached the exit back into the Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
Then Acellerando pulsed.  The HG again immediately ran past the now 5<br/>
guards, past the 2 medding casters that hadn&#39;t awakened yet, and right to<br/>
little ole me.  Smack, smack and forthwith I was down to a bubble.  At this<br/>
point the guards had done nearly 1000 hp&#39;s to the HG, a caster had awakened<br/>
and nuked it with a couple of frost spirals and still it ignored all in<br/>
favor of me.  Fortunately it didn&#39;t stun me again and I was able to outrun<br/>
it while it let the guards and assorted PC&#39;s beat the daylights out of it<br/>
from behind.<br/>
<br/>
After it was killed I got not less than 4 tells asking me how I managed to<br/>
taunt the HG so successfully that the group hunting near the bridge was able<br/>
to smack the heck out of it without risk.  To my answers of I don&#39;t know,<br/>
guess he just hates lite jazz I was assaulted.  Three of the /tell&#39;ers<br/>
actually accused me of hiding an exploit that allowed me to taunt the HG.<br/>
Needless to say I politely asked them to /bug it so as to be sure I couldn&#39;t<br/>
get away with it again.  They were not amused.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had many examples of &#39;bard hate&#39; or whatever we want to call it<br/>
lately, but this was sure pretty apparent as a bizarre hate list incident.<br/>
Only thing I can figure is that somehow the code is messed up to the point<br/>
that when a song pulses, the mobs consider it cast on everything within its<br/>
radius, whether it has an effect or not.  A similar example happened once to<br/>
me in Misty Thicket.  I was singing Accelerando when someone not in my group<br/>
decided to duel someone else also not in my group.  I was standing near the<br/>
aggressor and as soon as my song pulsed, the guards uttered that horrid<br/>
statement about &#39;bards like you&#39;.  I fled instantly, but since I knew<br/>
neither I nor my groupmate who wasn&#39;t even in the zone, had attacked the<br/>
guards I feel sure some bug occurred.  I /bugged it at the time.  Has anyone<br/>
else had similar things happen to them when their song radius might have<br/>
included someone but did not actually affect them?<br/>
