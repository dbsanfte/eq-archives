<div id="ygrps-yiv-515203390">Had to tell you guys about this. I am a 36th bard. Killing HGs in North<br/>
Karana. Found 2 and charmed one, let them fight. Slipped up a couple of<br/>
times, so I was at 75% health when My HG kills the other, He&#39;s at 25%<br/>
heath, and an EVEN /con to me. I wade in for Melee.<br/>
<br/>
I sing Fear, Chains, and Fufil&#39;s. 50% resist rate on all, so I<br/>
concentrate on Fear. I have ~850 HP, so a few &quot;HG hits you for 94, HG<br/>
hits you for 94, HG bashes you for 27, YOU are STUNNED&quot; and we are both<br/>
down to almost nothing. I decide if I can get fear to stick one more<br/>
time, i&#39;m leaving, even though the HG is dow to maybe 5%.<br/>
<br/>
Then: &quot;A HG hits you for 78!, You have been knocked Unconscious!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now being unconscious is something that has not happenned to me in 10<br/>
levels. The mobs usually run right by that buffer and kill you outright.<br/>
So I lay there Unconscious looking from overhead at my prone body,<br/>
waiting for the killing blow. And I see:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A HG tries to hit YOU but misses, A HG tries to hit YOU, but you<br/>
DODGE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then the best part: &quot;A HG flees in terror!&quot; I still had Screech<br/>
playing, and the HG ran away. I popped back up, got a quick dose of<br/>
hymn, which must have put me at ~10 HP. Equipped my MM drum and started<br/>
selo&#39;s and ran. AND I actually RAN. 36th level selo&#39;s with a MM drum<br/>
seems to overcome the massive AGI penalty of low health (I checked my<br/>
AGI it was ~50). I made it to the zone safely, never saw the HG again.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share this with all of you, I was so astounded it happenned<br/>
:)<br/>

BTW, if it had not happenned this way, I could have commented on the<br/>
&quot;lose one bubble of XP at 36th discussion, but alas, it does not appear<br/>
I can :)</div>
