Emergency Patch April 1, 2000<br/>
------------------------------------- <br/>
The EQ servers were quickly brought down this morning for an emergency patch<br/>
update. We&#39;d apologize once again for taking the servers down, but what<br/>
would be the point? <br/>
<br/>
The following changes were made: <br/>
<br/>
1.) Wizards - We&#39;ve finally given Wizards a few quick &quot;Insta-Death&quot; spells.<br/>
Our hope is that this will make all the wizards shut up for a little while,<br/>
until they start to complain about lack of plate armor for their class. <br/>
<br/>
2.) Druids - Because of the over-abundance of Druids in Norrath, the next<br/>
time you login one out of every three Druids will be randomly reassigned a<br/>
new class. <br/>
<br/>
3.) Warriors and Monks - These melee classes have been given magical<br/>
abilities at last. They now can bind, gate, heal and summon food. <br/>
<br/>
4.) Magicians and Enchanters - New pet spell added: Nagafen. We&#39;ve given<br/>
these two classes a fine new pet to help them in their everyday struggles in<br/>
Norrath. <br/>
<br/>
5.) Rogues - We feel this class is our crowning achievement. We believe it<br/>
has been perfectly balanced, and as such will not receive any modifications<br/>
for the rest of EverQuest&#39;s life. <br/>
<br/>
6.) Hybrids (Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights) - After careful data<br/>
analysis we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that simply giving these classes a few<br/>
of their spellcaster counterparts spells is not enough. So thus we&#39;ve given<br/>
them all the spells they would normally receive had they been a Druid,<br/>
Cleric or Necromancer. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to these changes, the Necromancer and Cleric classes will be<br/>
overhauled in the near future! Unfortunately if you already have a character<br/>
that is one of these two classes you will loose all your items and be<br/>
randomly renamed. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience! <br/>
