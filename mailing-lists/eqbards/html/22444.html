<div id="ygrps-yiv-471974584">I guess evade just lowers you on the hatelist, but doesn&#39;t remove you. Then <br/>
again, skellies aggro on pretty much everyone as long as they are close.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in this situation, you should resort to taunting her (not the <br/>
skill, just talking trash) and hope that she is so distracted by that it <br/>
gives you enough time for the immobilize to wear off. Role playing opens up <br/>
a lot of different possibilities. Or you could go the pity approach if one <br/>
of the high level Kithicor denizens is nearby and get something big to <br/>
attack you, requiring her to save you so you can possibly run away.<br/>
<br/>
You have nothing to lose in trying. :-)<br/>

&gt;I think I&#39;ll shoot the arrow at the skeleton just before Immobilize wears<br/>

&gt;eventually fall back and forget about me, but it will be in her path as she<br/>

&gt; &gt;Sorry this is off topic, but I know this is an active list and need a<br/>
&gt;quick<br/>
&gt; &gt;answer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>
&gt; &gt;wizard.  She&#39;s not out to kill me, just to get an item back.  Currently<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;immobilized and she&#39;s sitting a little ways in front of me medding.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>
&gt; &gt;her, then evade and hope that it would attack the medding 45 wizard in<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;path before continuing on to me.  (I want it to stun her so I can flee<br/>
&gt; &gt;before she gets another root off)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Probably not, since in order for a monster to switch targets, it needs to<br/>
&gt;have distance issues.  If you can&#39;t move farther from the wizard, that<br/>
&gt;skelly will just ignore her and move on to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;FYI 14 vs 45 - just give her the darn thing back.<br/>
