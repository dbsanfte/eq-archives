<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233164334">Since you&#39;re already near Freeport, I&#39;d recommend the Dervish Camp in West<br/>
Commons. The Dervs there will con blue to you at least 75% of the time, unlike<br/>
the 3 derv camps in north Ro, where most will con green. The Dervs are great for<br/>
working Dual Wield, I had 70 skill by the time I left there at level 18. I chose<br/>
to go to Unrest, where I am now.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend avoiding Befallen until the low 20s, as those monsters seemed<br/>
to get stirred up and decide all bards must be vanquished. In Unrest, you&#39;ll<br/>
want to group up. Get in a good group of 5-6, and you will do very well, as our<br/>
utility is maximized with a full party. A really good party in Unrest has 1-2<br/>
clerics (both for healing/buffing and expulse undead), 1-2 wizards (no more then<br/>
3 clerics wizards in my opinion), and in our case, a bard and two heavier tanks<br/>
(can be a warrior, monk, paladin, sk, ranger). From 18-20 we were fighting red<br/>
cons. Whenever I&#39;m in Unrest, I pull. I actually get invited to come to groups,<br/>
who say I get them with very good pulls (last night I yanked a barkeep  (apron),<br/>
undead knight (blood-stained mantle), and reclusive ghoul mage (and he had the<br/>
savant&#39;s). The trick though, is that when I pull I make sure only 1-2 monsters<br/>
follow me. Sometimes you&#39;ll get a train hitting you as you&#39;re pulling. If that<br/>
happens you can often run around the house, the monsters tend to get hung up on<br/>
stairs or inside the front of the mansion, then you can zone out to clear the<br/>
hate list. It is very important to me not to train monsters into others, but<br/>
even more important that I don&#39;t bring monsters to my group that are too much.<br/>
If I make a bad pull, I&#39;ll make sure only I pay for my mistake, and not my<br/>
group. Also, if I pull soemthing to hard (pulled a barbed skeleton, we&#39;ve doner<br/>
them before, but this resisted the clerics and mages) I rapidly cycle bellow and<br/>
have everyone else stop hitting it. When it&#39;s on me I take it away from the<br/>
party. They STILL have to zone out to clear it&#39;s hate list, and barbeds have a<br/>
long memory, but party members remember when you are right by them. The loot at<br/>
Unrest is good, as long as your group is. Fine Steel weapons sell for several<br/>
plat to players, runes, words, etc. sell well in Unrest itself to magi looking<br/>
into spell research, and of course for us their is the allure of small bronze<br/>
plate.<br/>

&gt; I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.  I am mostly around<br/>
&gt; Oasis but willing to travel for exp and loot.  I need a good place with<br/>
&gt; decent amount of plp to group with.  I tried Unrest, and Highpass.  It seems<br/>
&gt; that no one wants a bard because we attract too much attentions.  Please<br/>
&gt; give suggestions.<br/>
