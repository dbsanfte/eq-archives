<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523268773"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Actually, clerics have more options than just healing. So do wizards (though<br/>
&gt; to a smaller extent)<br/>
&gt; Clerics have Quite good stuns that sometimes it is worth taking another look<br/>
&gt; at.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And what else do clerics do?  More options, and you list only one.<br/>
  <br/>
  Clerics are healers, buffers, stunners, undead nukers, nukers in that<br/>
  order.  They don&#39;t do much more, and in fact I prefer they not blast<br/>
  anything.  And I prefer paladins do the stunning.  We are talking about<br/>
  grouping, not solo play.  <br/>
<br/>
  Wizards do more?  Thats a joke.  They are snowflake button pressers<br/>
  and gaters.  Yeah i&#39;ve seen a wizard stun or root something but rarely<br/>
  in a well balanced group.  mumble: wizards have more... &lt;chuckle&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
  Enchanters and Bards are the most situation adapative classes and<br/>
  that makes them the hardest to teach correct gameplay.  All the<br/>
  other classes are one or two tracked minded with very little <br/>
  strategy based thinking.<br/>
