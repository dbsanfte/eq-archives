<div id="ygrps-yiv-528311399">I&#39;m thinking they will most likely be upgrades to our existing songs that<br/>
either don&#39;t work or are of limited use already.  I know lets drain more<br/>
mana from npc&#39;s that have unlimited mana that should be great for PvP.  Ooh,<br/>
no binding song, how about a song that unbinds someone.  Another great PvP<br/>
only song, or maybe it would make stationary npc&#39;s start to wander, that&#39;d<br/>
be useful.  <br/>
Pardon me if I sound bitter or doubtful, but when 6 months after release the<br/>
bard class is still unfinished I think I have cause to be.  <br/>
GZ said our songs were waiting for something?  Perhaps they will be songs<br/>
that only affect Iskar, that&#39;d be useful and a year late.  <br/>
Ok enough silliness (maybe), some useful suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
A song that increases our chance of success in trade skills.  Useful to<br/>
some, useless to others.  About the only area of the game we don&#39;t have a<br/>
spell to directly affect currently in some fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that I can&#39;t see what they have in mind.  There is little need<br/>
for an upgrade to most of our existing songs, upgrade to hymn highly<br/>
unlikely to ever occur.  I still greatly doubt that a high level binding<br/>
song would be unbalancing.  Given the lack of knowledge other classes have<br/>
about bards, if it was self only most people would never even know it<br/>
existed.<br/>

Throughout the history of this list, we have had several discussions on our<br/>
missing songs.  Verant is unlikely to give us a new song that &quot;unbalances&quot;<br/>
our class, i.e. a binding song.  Several people have come up with<br/>
ideas/suggestions for our missing songs.  For the sake of discussion, what<br/>
type of songs can they give us that will not upset the class balance.  Lets<br/>
classify our songs into categories.  The categories I can come up with are:<br/>
<br/>
1) Stat buffing  		i.e. Anthem, Warsong, Chant of Battle, etc.<br/>
that raise a primary stat/attack bonuses<br/>
2) Resistance buffing 	i.e. rhythm and psalm series <br/>
3) Regeneration  	i.e. Hymm, Jig, Mana song<br/>
4) Direct damage 	i.e. Bellow and Desperate Dirge<br/>
5) Damage over time 	i.e  DDD and CoD<br/>
6) Movement  		i.e. Selos and teleport song<br/>
7) Target negative effect 	i.e. Chains, Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Charm,<br/>
Largos<br/>
8) General 		i.e  invisibility, underwater breathing and<br/>
levitation song<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only 26th level so I don&#39;t have much knowledge of the songs higher than<br/>
30th level.  As a result, there are probably a couple more categories to<br/>
add.  These categories are enough though for the sake of discussion.  I<br/>
would guess that Verant thinks they have pretty much covered all the bases<br/>
in regards to our songs.  We have a wide variety of choices to select from.<br/>
Assuming that Verant thinks our current songs provide everything we need, I<br/>
would imagine they are having a tough time deciding on what our missing<br/>
songs should do.  Assuming that they don&#39;t want to give us any new<br/>
abilities, the only option I see is to give us better versions or<br/>
combinations of songs we already have.   For example, a better version of<br/>
Hymn that heals more damage per tick.  Another possibility is a combination<br/>
of Hymn and Jig to provide both health and stamina recovery.  <br/>
<br/>
So to sum it all up, I think it is more likely that our missing songs will<br/>
be better versions/combos of our current songs versus songs that give us a<br/>
new ability such as bind or gate.  What does everyone else think?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Verant once replied to this - saying &quot;The new songs will be added once<br/>
&gt; something else is added&quot;..  As far as a bind song - if the info from JMC<br/>
&gt; (a<br/>
&gt; former member of this list who allegedly had close contacts within the<br/>
&gt; development group) It ain&#39;t ever gonna happen.<br/>
