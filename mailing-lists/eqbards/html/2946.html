<br/>
Misty Thicket is a great place to grow up in!<br/>
<br/>
Rokenn Swiftsong hits all the high notes!  Sound advice truly.<br/>
<br/>
I would say though that getting Lysera&#39;s Locating song as soon as you can is<br/>
a good thing.  And Selos and a drum - these have been my mainstay for many<br/>
levels.  You can make lots of friends helping them find their temporarily<br/>
mis-located corpses - and even in a nice zone like misty - they can be very<br/>
paniced at the loss and you will be a great hero and friend for life!  Never<br/>
charge for this duty - is my rule - donations can be accepted of course but<br/>
if you put a price on this service you may get asked to go to places that<br/>
you will wish you have never seen - eg: Runnyeye & Gorge of King Xorbb and<br/>
feel obligated to accept.<br/>

		Hail All,<br/>
<br/>
		I recently subscribed to this mailing list & have lurked <br/>
		a couple of days to get the feel for it before jumping <br/>
		in.  I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>
		Quellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>
		extreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>
		desert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>
		as of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>
		intend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>
		wanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>
		my profession? ;)<br/>
<br/>
		You are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>
		reading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>
		I&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>
		about here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>
<br/>
		Most of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>
		&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>
		all of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>
		of the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>
		affecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>
		would be well appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks in advance,<br/>
