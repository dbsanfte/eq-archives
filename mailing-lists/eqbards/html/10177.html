<div id="ygrps-yiv-310744561">First off I would like to introduce myself. I play Galeras, wood elf bard, on <br/>
E&#39;ci. If you examine my character you will see something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Hail, I am Galeras, merchant and bard, lover of fine wine and women. <br/>
I grew up poor but do not intend to die that way. Some day I will live in the <br/>
highest trees of Kelethin where only the wealthy abide.<br/>
<br/>
I wish Verant gave you more room. Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I started this character with a simple RP idea in mind, to play a character <br/>
that was not twinked and had a strong desire to become rich. I should mention <br/>
that I started Galeras on a server where I have no other characters and no <br/>
friends to &quot;help&quot;. I have a few goals along the way for him, that I feel <br/>
define &quot;rich&quot; and I use as milestones in my RP experiment. The first of which <br/>
was to be in full bronze by level 8. A goal which I achieved last week after <br/>
almost 4 days of /played time. In addition to the bronze I have a shiny brass <br/>
shield, mino axe, tentacle whip, dwarven tunic and a few other things.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am sure many people will wonder how one can do this without twinking. <br/>
Let me just tell you how I began. I really don&#39;t want a lot of people doing <br/>
this. Believe it or not I hate twinked characters with items out of their reach. <br/>
Actually I love to see an orc or goblin kill a twink in full rubicite.<br/>
<br/>
I did the Felewithe mail run twice to get my first song. Then I basically <br/>
quested and killed things until level 5. By level 5 I probably had made about <br/>
20pp. Most of this was done by trading. I am after all a merchant & bard. At <br/>
level 5 I decided to travel, one of my favorite passtimes. So, I picked up a <br/>
few passengers that wanted to travel with me and I went to Rivervale. (I am <br/>
constantly helping others travel, find their corpses, etc. One of the reasons <br/>
I chose a bard for my experiment. They have many ways to help others.) I was <br/>
hoping to find a Blackened Iron Medallion at a good price that I could sell <br/>
for a profit. Instead I saw a medium bronze breastplate for 10pp. I bought it <br/>
and sold it in the commons for 45pp.  Anyway you no doubt get the idea of how I <br/>
got to where I am.<br/>
<br/>
My questions are these:<br/>
<br/>
* Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
<br/>
* Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
<br/>
* What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>
<br/>
* Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this character.  And, I <br/>
  never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent posts. Will I <br/>
  be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
