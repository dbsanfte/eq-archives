<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757326133">It works as both a wind instrument and a greater lightstone. The Crown<br/>
of the Frogluk Kings doesn&#39;t say &quot;Effect: Greater Lightstone&quot; either,<br/>
and yet when it is worn it&#39;s quite obvious that effect is on it as<br/>
you&#39;ve indicated. Checking whether it works as an instrument was simple.<br/>
Can it be equipped in melee #2? yes. Does playing Shari&#39;s Sonorous<br/>
Clouding with it equipped invis you? yep. There you go, works as a wind<br/>
instrument.<br/>

&gt; effect&quot;. If it has a greater lightstone effect I haven&#39;t noticed cuz I wear<br/>
&gt; a froglok crown, and I use my guise when it&#39;s night (Ultravision is SO much<br/>
&gt; better than Infra). If you don&#39;t know anyone with a horn and want to take<br/>
&gt; your own screenshot, logon to Veeshan and give me a tell. </span></blockquote></div>
