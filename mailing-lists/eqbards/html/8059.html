<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734231584">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
When I play EQ I allways get asked to play the Jig to increase mana<br/>
regeneration. I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate it. I<br/>
even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the mana is<br/>
not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>
I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly ever solo<br/>
a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H slash<br/>
allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not twinked I<br/>
got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is faster than<br/>
sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why can&#39;t I solo<br/>
a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>
