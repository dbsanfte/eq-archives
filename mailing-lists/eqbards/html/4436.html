<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739013714"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; crown. We were the only two people in the zone. In comes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; L28 druid and a L25 cleric, who decide they also want the<br/>

&gt; Do you see something wrong with this picture?  Druids can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even *use* the BI crown.  While I don&#39;t want to dredge up the<br/>
&gt; twinking topic, I see stuff like this happening way too often,<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s why I feel so strongly about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with this picture. There was a druid AND a<br/>
cleric. A cleric CAN use a BI crown (uh oh! acronym!). Both of the people<br/>
were appropriate level.<br/>
<br/>
I think you see it happening so much because you&#39;re constantly looking for<br/>
it where it probably doesn&#39;t exist. Unless, of course, ever helping anyone<br/>
in your group get anything is twinking (even though you&#39;re both of the<br/>
appropriate level).<br/>

&gt; &gt; lightning 7 times on a charmed warlord, and manages one<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought lightning was an outdoors-only spell?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Careless Lightning, a druid&#39;s L19 DD spell is not outdoor only. It maxes<br/>
out at 99 dmg and is what a druid has to fall back on from L19-L48 when<br/>
fighting in Solusek A or B.<br/>
