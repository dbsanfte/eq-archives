<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237053073">For our guild&#39;s first Sir Lucan bashing on Solusek Ro (Graccus&#39;s. One of the<br/>
first on the server, even) they had a bard (Clavicus) do the pulling. He was<br/>
the only person to die on the pull.<br/>
<br/>
Later, they used a ranger/druid pair. (Harmony with the druid, ranger pulls.<br/>
Two people to hold doors open...)<br/>

&gt;&gt; Or else<br/>
&gt;&gt; We learn to type<br/>
&gt;&gt; in short little<br/>
&gt;&gt; bursts like this!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Amen Anthem.  &lt;clickety click&gt; and typing fragments is the only<br/>

&gt;  ...after 3 ldcs show&#39;d up out of the blue last night and no<br/>
&gt;  enchanter to handle the situation.  That&#39;s all I could type<br/>
&gt;  after being pummelled for 400 dmg.  Really get&#39;s the pulse<br/>
&gt;  going...damn adrenaline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Speaking of exciting, I got the chance to pull Sir Lucan<br/>
&gt;  last night.  About 12 people or so, all L45+ and they decide<br/>
&gt;  I should be the poor loser who pulls him.  (I&#39;ve never fought<br/>
&gt;  nor pulled him before, hell I had to actually track him to<br/>
&gt;  locate his spot.)  Wouldn&#39;t you know, one roaming guard, two<br/>
&gt;  posted guards, one Brother Gentry or something and Sir Lucan<br/>
&gt;  himself.  3 closed doors, 1 winding passageway to make an<br/>
&gt;  escape.  Yuck.  I had reso, words, symbol ~1900 hp.  Preparing<br/>
&gt;  to get the worst beating of my life, I ran in opened two of<br/>
&gt;  the doors, pulsed selo&#39;s, pixied lucan (just to get him pissy)<br/>
&gt;  and made a run for it.  The paladins in the group were joking<br/>
&gt;  about how they&#39;d watch me slowly lose hp and die.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  No such luck for them.  I think Lucan&#39;s personal guard hit<br/>
&gt;  me once for 100, and Lucan himself hit me for double 75 -<br/>
&gt;  only after warping ontop of me.  I beat them out of the<br/>
&gt;  guard house so fast that they warped after I cleared<br/>
&gt;  the front gates (smooch smooch battle drums).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  During the Lucan fight, I tossed everything I had at the guy<br/>
&gt;  and right before the party wiped him out, I zoned out.  Was<br/>
&gt;  a pretty fun night, and I still can visit the bard guild in<br/>
&gt;  Freeport &lt;g&gt;<br/>
