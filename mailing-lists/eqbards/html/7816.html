 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I tried to help some cleric who&#39;d lost his corpse in the<br/>
lava in Sol A.  He was even trusting enough to /consent to me.<br/>
My song pointed me down a lava ledge and I couldn&#39;t see a way<br/>
out (past the little &quot;window&quot; that looks into lava at the top<br/>
of the curved stairs near the entrance to Sol A).  I assume it<br/>
leads to Sol B, but being one-way there was no way I could<br/>
drag his corpse back to him.  Eventually a GM got his corpse<br/>
for him.<br/>
