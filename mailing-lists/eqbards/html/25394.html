<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480516158">ROFLMAO!  I thought that was what you meant by &quot;(guess it didn&#39;t work)&quot;.<br/>
Not sure, this guy was gone for over 3 months.  Did you actually destroy all<br/>
your No Drop items before you deleted Shada?  If not, then I imagine he<br/>
would reappear with everything he had that was No Drop when you deleted him.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry if I opened a can of worms for ya man.<br/>

No I started a character from scratch.  I never inquired to the<br/>
possibility of restoring Shada.  I deleted my no drop items and gave<br/>
away all tradeable items.  Any details on when the restore would date<br/>
back to?  Would I be restored at the time I was deleted (0 items) or<br/>
sometime before with my no drop items?<br/>
<br/>
God help me, why am I asking?<br/>
