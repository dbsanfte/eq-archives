<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163450885">No apology needed.  I agree that it should be worth 50pp however that has to<br/>
be made to happen.  Just pointing out that while there is no way I could<br/>
take Dvinn, barring the very unusual circumstances last nite with 9 or the<br/>
12 people on him dying before me, I can make 50pp.  Therefore to someone who<br/>
can&#39;t take on Dvinn, even with a comparable level group (12th), the dirk<br/>
probably is worth 50pp or more.  But since its better than many higher level<br/>
weapons, it still messes up the balance.  <br/>
<br/>
Did you see Brian Hook&#39;s posting on camping?  I think the dirk is the<br/>
perfect example of why Brian is wrong.  Dvin always has it so its camped<br/>
even more because campers know they can run and sell it and come right back<br/>
for another one easily.<br/>
<br/>
Also of note, I&#39;ve found that speed is much more important than most people<br/>
seem to espouse.  While the damage/speed ration is important, I think speed<br/>
is even more important than that.  I have had little trouble with casters<br/>
for quite some time using a fine steel scimitar.  The ranger in my group at<br/>
the same level can&#39;t solo caster&#39;s at all because he&#39;s too slow.  Even<br/>
though his ratio is better, he doesn&#39;t disrupt their casting anywhere near<br/>
as often as I can with my faster weapon.  this of course makes the dirk even<br/>
more valuable against casters.<br/>
