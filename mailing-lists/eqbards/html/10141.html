<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Oh thank god,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    After being the world&#39;s poorest bard for 22 levels, I must say that I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have found the greatest place I have ever been for experience and cash.  If<br/>
any of you level 30 and under bards are in need of a fun time and a good<br/>
place, I would suggest Solusek&#39;s Eye.  In the last week, I have gone from<br/>
level 22 to almost 25, and made about 1400pp (no kidding - I know you big<br/>
guys are saying ~yawn~, but I&#39;ve never had more than 100pp in the bank<br/>
hehe).  I am now the proud owner of 2 Obsidian Scimitars, a drakescale belt,<br/>
a pair of Kobold hide boots, and an obsidian shard.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;    My guild and I have been exploring the place for a week now and we love<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it!  Of course, we&#39;ve only gotten as far as the Foreman&#39;s room but we&#39;ll get<br/>
a little further after a while.  Our group was myself, a 25 rogue, a 25<br/>
monk, a 27 ranger, a 26 paladin, and a 26 warrior.  So far I&#39;ve only died<br/>
once, which is incredible for me.  Hell, I died getting there (forgot to<br/>
check the time and ran smack through the middle of Kithicor at 1 am -- you<br/>
writhe in pain....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  I have yet to see a champion or a<br/>
mage other than on the ranger&#39;s tracking, but we haven&#39;t gotten that<br/>
direction yet.  We will, poppa needs some brand new shoes and sleeves, as<br/>
soon as we level a few more times.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;    Anyway, just a suggestion for those of you who are looking for a nice<br/>
 </span></blockquote>place to hunt.  Although you&#39;ll need a good group, the place is a blast so<br/>
far.  There are lots of &quot;safe&quot; places to pull to once you fight your way to<br/>
them, most are right next to Sol B zone lines.  And so far, I&#39;ve encountered<br/>
no warping bugs for MOBS, and no Z-Axis problems, I have no trouble using<br/>
Lullaby at all.  It has saved our asses more than once, I know one time we<br/>
pulled a fire gob shaman, 2 flame gobs, and 2 cinder gobs when Singe showed<br/>
up!  We barely eeked that one out, but damn it felt good!<br/>

&gt;Sorry to ramble on, I&#39;m just in awe of this place!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S. Of course you know that as soon as I post this I&#39;m going to go back<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and die there 25 times tonight, Murphy&#39;s Law.  Doh!<br/>
