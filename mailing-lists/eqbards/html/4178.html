<br/>
Thats what i&#39;ve always wondered , in this &quot; virtual world &quot; why are there no <br/>
children ? <br/>
I mean , it isn&#39;t essential to the game , but it would add to the realism  <br/>
for me personally. We have lots of quests involving sons / daughters. but you <br/>
have no idea how old they are , we have no idea how old anyone is. Some <br/>
people might say this is a good thing , i think it sucks. I personally would <br/>
have loved starting out as a teenager , and every ten levels getting a new <br/>
look. being grown up or even old by lvl 50.  So in that whole crappy conning <br/>
system you could tell a red from a RED just by looking at them ( i know this <br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to most monsters and animals and such) .<br/>
I personally wish this game was more immersive , sometimes it can be , but <br/>
other times it just isn&#39;t at all. I would like to be able to feel why the <br/>
dark elves are evil , and why they hate the wood elves and such. ( ok i&#39;m <br/>
ramblin ) <br/>
