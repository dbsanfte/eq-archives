<br/>
This is always fun.  Try different varieties of this.  Things like this<br/>
<br/>
Take a new Lvl 5th Warrior<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; How many strikes does it take to get to the center of the warrior (aka How many licks does it take to get the center of a lollipop)<br/>
2&gt; Who can kill the warrior with one strike. Kinda like a pina colata. Win a price if you can hit him one he dies (might have to try a lower level character)<br/>
3&gt;  Pin The Tail On Grim Feather.  (Only for the very brave) This is a classic.<br/>
4&gt;  Find Dragosothos&#39; missing dragon named Fluffy.  This is also an EQ Classic.<br/>
5&gt;  Ole Redneck Party. Just bring some farm animals...<br/>
6&gt;  MOB Lamba Train. Make it big a long.<br/>
7&gt; Take &quot;photos&quot; of the guild and the undead cyclops charmed. Group shots are a plus.<br/>
8&gt; Have a &quot;cock&quot; fight.  Charm to avos and ahve them fight<br/>
9&gt; Find Dragosothos&#39; lost pet dragon<br/>
<br/>
And the final one.....<br/>
<br/>
10&gt;  Become the 1st everquest Nudist Guild<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  First let me appologize if you get 4 or more copies of this.  All the<br/>
  mail servers are screwed up around here...<br/>
<br/>
  k, this is completely off topic BUT I need your help.  My guild is<br/>
  doing a joint guild event in South<br/>
  Karana sometime in the near future (with 5 other guilds).  I, being a<br/>
  fun loving party bard, have been<br/>
  appointed to the &quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very<br/>
  creative today and I&#39;m fresh out of<br/>
  new and amusing ideas.  I want to<br/>
  try to do something fun that isn&#39;t the same old same old.  I figure<br/>
  the best place to go for some ideas<br/>
  would be here!  The home of the fun loving, party enhancing,<br/>
  entertaining bard.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for you ideas in advance :)<br/>
