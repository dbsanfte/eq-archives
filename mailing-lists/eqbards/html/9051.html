<div id="ygrps-yiv-216099252">My group has been hunting here quite a bit, and it IS a very nice place to hunt.  Lots of things<br/>
to charm, lots of space to run.  There are three big things to worry about though, from my<br/>
experience:<br/>
<br/>
- The pathing and warping in the zone is VERY bad.  You&#39;ll be fighting a giant and suddenly<br/>
  it&#39;s just GONE.  Sometimes it warps just a short distance, which is no big deal,<br/>
  he&#39;ll come running after you quickly enough.  The real danger is when they warp a long<br/>
  distance away, and then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen to walk<br/>
  near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant friends and the little cyclops<br/>
  who wants to be part of the group.<br/>
<br/>
- Hasten Quickboots or whatever the name of the little dude from the JBoot quest is<br/>
  steals your kills.<br/>
<br/>
- Sometimes there&#39;s too MANY hill giants.  When you&#39;re in a group, one hill giant is tasty,<br/>
  two makes them see how powerful you are as a bard.  Three means run to the zone.<br/>
  Four means run to the zone and try and take a screen cap.  :)<br/>

&gt; Wow, thanks for the tip on clearing the &quot;trash&quot; mobs from the<br/>
&gt; hills here to get giants to spawn.  I made over 350pp there<br/>
&gt; tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>
&gt; soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>
&gt; my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>
&gt; or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>
&gt; to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>
&gt; sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>
&gt; died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>
&gt; was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>
&gt; drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>
&gt; both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>
&gt; range to heal me in time.<br/>
