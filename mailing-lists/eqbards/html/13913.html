&quot;another class&quot; when you can play this class and have a pet<br/>
that&#39;s better than that &quot;another class&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Unless you don&#39;t believe the classes should be balanced (which<br/>
is a valid viewpoint, but yet another reason I don&#39;t like<br/>
class-based systems).<br/>

&gt; Or hell can it even think? A pet in no case is a replacement for a real<br/>

&gt; our group we got a necro pet or a magician pet.<br/>

It&#39;s not - it&#39;s the necro and the pet.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>
charm, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t regen mana, but you can.  <br/>
No the pet can&#39;t nuke/DoT/buff, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>
think, but you can.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, if the idea of casting classees having pets that<br/>
can melee better than or almost as well as melee classes makes<br/>
sense, then so does the idea of melee classes having pets that<br/>
can cast spells better than or almost as well as casting<br/>
classes.  /pet heal me, /pet nuke &lt;target&gt;, /pet evac us, /pet<br/>
mes &lt;target&gt;, /pet buff &lt;target&gt;, and make them regen mana 5x<br/>
faster than players (which is approx how fast pets heal).<br/>
