<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Emperor Crush - The dude that runs the whole show. If you take him<br/>
 </span></blockquote>down, you get a real nice piece &gt;of small magical ringmail...<br/>
<br/>
(Dwarven Ringmail Tunic)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Royal Guard - A orc ROGUE if you believe it...I do, because his<br/>
 </span></blockquote>backstab is brutal&gt;Lord Darish - Haven&#39;t met up with him often (Even as<br/>
my level 15 Warrior alter ego) Not sure what &gt;good he is...<br/>
<br/>
I believe Darish also carries some special axe, although I&#39;m not<br/>
certian. he spawns in the &quot;throne room&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;The Prophet - An oracle on steroids...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The scariest thing is The Prophet does is buff DVinn and Crush with<br/>
Spirit of the Wolf. I had no idea he was doing this when I&#39;d been to CB<br/>
before, and I remember being mowed down by a train of Dvinn, Crush, etc.<br/>
when I was in CB at lower levels. It&#39;s a pretty nasty thing of him to<br/>
do. ;p He sometimes has Tergon&#39;s Spellbook, a lore item. I believe this<br/>
is for a quest. &gt;Emisarry - The orc with a mission...To whack you over<br/>
and over and over with his spear. Really, he&#39;s &gt;quite good at his<br/>
job...&gt;Ambassador D&#39;vinn - Dark Elf with an attitude. This is THE bad<br/>
guy of the whole area. Not sure &gt;what level he is, but it usually takes<br/>
a group to nuke him. Awesome dagger (Dragoon Dirk) to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;found when he falls though (Hint: If you&#39;re not on his hate list, don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>attack orcs near him...He might &gt;ignore you if you&#39;re not fighting!)<br/>
<br/>
Dvinn seems to also have a racial hatred toward Wood Elves, as does Dorn<br/>
in the 2nd Northern Ro Dervish Camp. Maybe the hatred is toward bards,<br/>
but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s actually Wood Elves. Perhaps all Dark<br/>
Elves (NPCs) have this dislike? BTW, Dvinn ALWAYS has the dagger, so at<br/>
least you know if you actually do beat him, you will get it. It is also<br/>
now a Lore Item, which is a good change to reduce overt camping in my<br/>
opinion. DVinn often has the Black Heart for the Paladin Quest, but not<br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>

I went to Crushbone the other day at Level 19, and Crushbone was a blue<br/>
con but to me was like fighting 2 dervish thugs at 17th or 18th, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t take him alone. The Prophet was VERY easy to kill. Dvinn -<br/>
don&#39;t even consider it. I paired up with a L24 druid the first go around<br/>
to get a Dragoon Dirk, and the only reason Dvinn died was because the<br/>
druid was a monster. DVinn was 19th-20th everytime we spawned. Even<br/>
splitting the exp with a L24, I got literally a quarter bubble exp off<br/>
of him. The Dragoon Dirk however is an awesome weapon, and is even<br/>
better then the Combine long sword I used. It seems with alot of these<br/>
that bronze armor puts you over the edge in taking hits from them, I was<br/>
still in 90% banded when I went, and wielded a Combine LS and a FS LS.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;These two are found elsewhere and are of note, because they can get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hard to kill at lower levels... &gt;Trainer - Found WAY on top of the hill<br/>
overlooking the castle. People camp this area heavily &gt;because he will<br/>
drop a Shiny Brass Shield (AC10, +10vsMagic, Lightstone)&gt;Taskmaster -<br/>
Slaver Boss. Has a nice leather whip to reach out and touch someone<br/>
with...Actually &gt;found behind the castle.&gt;Rondo - Dwarven Bandit found<br/>
in the mines. He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good &gt;reason<br/>
to ice him. &gt;If you give a slave a copper piece, he will read the number<br/>
of his shackles so you can match the keys up....<br/>
<br/>
WOW! I didn&#39;t know about the copper. Now I can go use those keys I&#39;ve<br/>
been collecting in the bank. Great tip.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a very rare spawn called &quot;the warlord&quot;, he can have a<br/>
Bracer of Battle. It&#39;s a very good piece of armor I hear in its own<br/>
right, but you also need it to complete the quest for the screaming<br/>
mace, along with the shiny brass shield.<br/>
