<br/>
For each instrument skill, you need to put one point into training for it.<br/>
So, when you make a level where you get a new skill, go to bard guild and<br/>
train 1 point into the new skill.  Then you can equip the instrument and use<br/>
it with songs the either require instrument or are enhanced by instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Mino horn is wind only - old rumor said it was brass too but that is not<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
Wind is one skill - flute and mino horns are wind instruments.  Charisma and<br/>
the Aquatic Aria and our invisible song (level 20) are wind (invis requires<br/>
wind so I bind in the bank and keep a spare mino horn or flute in the vault<br/>
if I need to make a run to my corpse and want invis - spare drum too &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Brass is another (different) skill - brass horns (trumpets) are brass<br/>
instrument. Denon&#39;s Dischord and Screetch are brass songs.<br/>
<br/>
I am on Innoruuk - give me a tell when you are online and playing your bard<br/>
- I would love to meet you!<br/>
