<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702019158"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; If you put the bracer in wrist slot #2, others will be able to see it.<br/>
&gt;If<br/>
&gt;&gt;  you put it in wrist slot #1, you&#39;ll be able to see it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true after you zone. After you zone you will see what is in slot 1,<br/>
and others will see what is in slot 2.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can see it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true if you reequip the bracer, you will usually see the last one<br/>
that has been worn (though that&#39;s kinda changed recently and doesn&#39;t 100%<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
But, once you zone, the above will be true again (slot 1 you see, slot 2<br/>
others see).<br/>
