and others will see what is in slot 2.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; can see it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true if you reequip the bracer, you will usually see the last one<br/>
that has been worn (though that&#39;s kinda changed recently and doesn&#39;t 100%<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
But, once you zone, the above will be true again (slot 1 you see, slot 2<br/>
others see).<br/>
