<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641814157">This is true. I went to make a Lambent Bracer one day and headed up to ToSR<br/>
with 1100 gold, a lambent stone, the charm, and the bracelet. I went to<br/>
Genni and bought the two Fire Opals. I then went to Ostorm, handed him the<br/>
two Fire Opals and the Lambent stone, and hit trade. He basically said<br/>
&#39;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#39;, &#39;Here is your Lambent Fire Opal!&#39;,<br/>
&#39;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&#39;. I found that rather odd. Since the<br/>
ordering of the speech indicated that just handing in the Fire Opals<br/>
finished the quest, I guessed that he had a Lambent Stone in his &#39;trade<br/>
queue&#39;. I ran and got 1100 more gold, bought two more Fire Opals, gave them<br/>
to Ostorm (didn&#39;t trade him a Lambent Stone), and I got the Lambent Fire<br/>
Opal.<br/>
	It was originally thought that the NPC would remember the list of things<br/>
that *you* gave him/her independent of everyone else. Turns out that there<br/>
is only one list. This means, of course that your level 50 buddy could give<br/>
William the Gypsy Lute and the Basalt Carapace, then you give him the<br/>
lambent Ruby, and you would get the Lambent BP with all the experience too.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

<br/>
This is a funny little screwup I learned as a lad in Kelethin doing the<br/>
spider silk quest over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you hand an item to the NPC, the NPC checks their inventory and<br/>
compares it with the list of things required to complete the quest.  If<br/>
there are fewer items in inventory than required to complete the quest, you<br/>
get the &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot; line.  When all the quest items<br/>
are in the NPCs inventory, the quest is completed and the inventory is<br/>
deleted.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered this quite by accident when I gave Sylia Windlehands 3<br/>
spidersilks instead of the 4 she wanted and completed the quest.  Every<br/>
subsequent time I did it I would bring 4 or more silks and give them to her<br/>
one at a time - and quite frequently it took fewer than 4 to complete the<br/>
quest.<br/>
<br/>
My theory, then, is that someone somehow handed in a single quest item,<br/>
perhaps thinking the lambent quests should be done in stages.  You handed in<br/>
the other three, triggering the quest completion (receiving your<br/>
breastplate, congrats!!!), and also gave one &quot;extra&quot; component, thus<br/>
triggering the &quot;extra&quot; error message.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that some quests require all the items to be given at the same<br/>
time, though I don&#39;t test to see which - most quests I do these days cost a<br/>
fair amount of time and/or money, and I don&#39;t want to repeat them if I<br/>
happen to guess wrong.  So although I have tested this trick with spider<br/>
silk (and once, by accident, with honey jum) I can&#39;t guarantee it works with<br/>
all quests.  Caveat questor = )<br/>
