<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023575428">Maybe they just classify it as a &quot;feature&quot;:-)  <br/>
<br/>
What I find ironic in this situation is the overall problem with pathing AI<br/>
bugs in the game.  In Cazic, you have the pathing bug we have been<br/>
discussing that works in the players favor.  On the opposite end of the<br/>
spectrum you have Mistmoore.  In Mistmoore, there are numerous pathing bugs<br/>
that work against the player.  One wrong move in the castle and you can pull<br/>
every mob inside.  If you cast an AE spell/song near the zone border you can<br/>
aggro stuff in the castle and they will nuke you from behind the wall.  In<br/>
the case of Cazic, you can get banned for exploiting a pathing bug.  In the<br/>
case of Mistmoore, mobs exploit pathing bugs to the players detriment but no<br/>
way will you ever get EXP reimbursed if you die this way.  Now both of these<br/>
situations are avoidable if the player knows about them but how many people<br/>
does that apply to?  I would venture to say that the vast majority of people<br/>
who play EQ, for whatever eason, do not subscribe to a mailing list like<br/>
this or read websites like EQVault.  As a result, they are unaware of issues<br/>
like pathing bugs that have a major impact on the game.<br/>
<br/>
Sidebar: Case in point about the mailing lists and websites comment.  I was<br/>
grouped with another bard the other night.  I was using Chains against<br/>
greater dark bones in Unrest.  GDBs never run away so you dont have to use<br/>
ensnare/chains on them for that purpose.  He asked me after the fight why I<br/>
was wasting my time singing Chains when GDBs never ran.  I told him that<br/>
Chains also slowed down a mobs attack speed.  He told me that I was flat out<br/>
wrong and that the only thing Chains did was stop mobs from fleeing.  I told<br/>
him to believe what he wanted but if he wanted to confirm it for himself he<br/>
could subscribe to this list or check out Rokenn&#39;s website.  He told me he<br/>
had never heard of either site.  I&#39;ve had numerous conversations like this<br/>
with other bards on E&#39;ci I have grouped with (but not the ones on this<br/>
list).  I&#39;m sure it applies to every other class as well.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the pathing bug issue.  I haven&#39;t seen anything from Verant in a<br/>
long time addressing the pathing bug issue.  A few weeks ago on EQVault<br/>
there was a poll asking what areas of the game you wanted Verant to focus on<br/>
fixing.  Off the top of my head, I think the possible answers were a) fix<br/>
existing known bugs 2) add more quests 3) class balance, 4) overcrowding.  I<br/>
think I left a few off but IIRC fixing existing known bugs was the #1<br/>
response.  Seems to me though that fixing known bugs (and pathing AI is a<br/>
big one) doesn&#39;t seem to be a very big priority.  When I get the time, I&#39;ll<br/>
post a message on the official EQ message board and bring this issue up<br/>
again.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; From how you describe the situation, I would guess that you were<br/>
&gt; unknowingly<br/>
&gt; using an exploit.  I imagine the other Bard was one of the one&#39;s on the<br/>
&gt; steps?  (I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it an exploit, tho, since I believe the<br/>
&gt; word<br/>
&gt; &quot;exploit&quot; implies &quot;intent&quot; :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that Verant can&#39;t fix this pathing bug, even though<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; known of it for a long time now.  It does make it impossible to fight in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; temple if attacked without exploiting unless every member of your group<br/>
&gt; stands within melee range.  Obviously this is impractical.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt; camped with a group in the halls for this reason alone.  Pulling to the<br/>
&gt; bottom or pulling to the top seem to be the only ways around this.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; players who knowingly camp the halls and abuse the bug that bother me.  1<br/>
&gt; wizard and 1 mage (w/o pet) standing in the corner nuking a mob standing<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; the stairs are definately &quot;knowingly&quot; using the exploit.  3 tanks engaging<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; mob in the hallway and 1 cleric standing behind are technically exploiting<br/>
&gt; in that the cleric could never possibly be attacked, but may not be<br/>
&gt; knowingly abusing the bug.  While they might wonder why the cleric is not<br/>
&gt; getting attacked, if it was their first time there, they would really have<br/>
&gt; no way of knowing.  This is the reason I jumped in this thread in the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; place.  To educate anyone who did not know of this bug, so they would know<br/>
&gt; what they were doing if and when the situation came up.<br/>
