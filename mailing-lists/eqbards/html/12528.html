<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-288011689">agreed.  and i do the same, as i recently finally got the arms, my last<br/>
piece.  i love my mith, but i love full imbrued too hehe.  damn i lost 7 STR<br/>
tho, what will i tell Harm?<br/>
<br/>
and since this is a trade thread, lemme ask for advice.  i was offerred<br/>
efreeti boots for my mith arms.  my guild said not to.  then i was offered<br/>
efreeti boots and a ykesha for my mith arms.  now i wouldn&#39;t use the ykesha<br/>
since i have both hate weps, but i owe someone a ykesha and could get boots<br/>
to my wiz.  what do you think of that trade?<br/>

&gt; I think silver-plated legs are better than mithril greaves for bards,<br/>
&gt; but this is just my opinion. Mithril Vambraces on the other <br/>
&gt; hand simply<br/>
&gt; cannot be beat by anything else a bard can equip. The arms <br/>
&gt; are ac 10 +7<br/>
&gt; str +5 sv magic if my memory is serving me well, while <br/>
&gt; imbrued are ac 16<br/>
&gt; +9 intel +10 sv vs poison. The mithril still have clearly better stat<br/>
&gt; modifiers than imbrued, but I wear the imbrued for 1) <br/>
&gt; color-matching, 2)<br/>
&gt; I felt it would be selfish to keep mithril when I was lucky enough to<br/>
&gt; have gotten planes armor (mithril goes back to guild), 3) That ac 16<br/>
&gt; becomes +27 ac with my AGI. </span></blockquote></div>
