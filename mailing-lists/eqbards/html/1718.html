<div id="ygrps-yiv-181460384">Has anyone ever heard a war chant sung by people who are actually about to go into battle, actually<br/>
about to kill and be killed? I am not talking roleplaying combat, I mean like, say Zulu war chants.<br/>
I have (albeit in recording not EVEN in person) and they reach down to the base of your skull and<br/>
fire up your adrenal system like smelting furnace fed with pure oxygen. Thoughout the history of<br/>
warfare music has stirred the soul and adrenal system&#39;s of the fighters. I have NEVER imagined a<br/>
Bard as a fop frequenting taverns but rather as one of the fighters, one with a gift for inspiration<br/>
of his or her comrads, firing up their spirits before and DURING battle. Do we imagine a Viking<br/>
warchant being maintained during battle by someone hanging at the back &quot;you go guys! Give it to<br/>
them! yah, you show em!&quot; or by one of the fighters risking his life with the rest of them, giving<br/>
meaning and weight to his song of inspiration? OF COURSE the enemies seek him out before the others,<br/>
he is the inspiration making them a cohesive fighting machine!<br/>
Bards belong in battle, wearing every protection his or her comrades are wearing, sure, maybe his or<br/>
her swordplay is a little weaker, but he or she makes up for it with *that song*.<br/>
Foppy tavern frequenters are fine for some but look for Tszaaz the Battle Bard standing shoulder to<br/>
shoulder with his comrades doing his best to inspire them. Then tell me that&#39;s not roleplaying.<br/>
