Sounds like your friends didn&#39;t know what they were talking about.  Gateway<br/>
doesn&#39;t mix/match motherboards.  They have 1 motherboard for one chip type<br/>
(Pentium) and another for Athlons (you have to, they&#39;re not compatible)<br/>
Generally speaking, up to about a year ago, Gateway shipped 90% of systems<br/>
with the 440BX (argueably the best chipset ever) board from Intel (if you<br/>
overclock it it IS the best board out and can use 133mhz SDRAM on it).<br/>
They had a couple other boards that shipped with E-Series (IE: Business)<br/>
systems but the customer systems were all shipped based on 440 BX boards.<br/>
<br/>
My PIII 550 is on a 440BX and I have it overclocked to 133mhz bus with<br/>
133mhz SDRAM.  It outperforms my best friend&#39;s PIII 700 and I haven&#39;t even<br/>
overclocked the processor.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, nice system.  But you got lied to about Gateway ;)  (I should<br/>
know.  I work at a Gateway Manufacturing center as a contracted Network<br/>
Engineer)<br/>
