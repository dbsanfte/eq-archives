<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126685271">They have made the chain song worsen than it was before.  I always have used<br/>
the song in HK for the past 7 lvls.  I am currently 35.  After last night<br/>
patch, I get resisted so many times that I find the song to be useless.  <br/>
	But when it does work, it really slow down the mob.  I used it to<br/>
pull the mob.  I would hit it with chain then run.  When I got back to my<br/>
party we had to wait 30 seconds for the mob to make it slow progress up to<br/>
us and during that whole time all magic attack plp was blasting at it.  By<br/>
the time it reaches me it was dead.  They have increase the power but<br/>
decrease the chance of successes.<br/>

Just read about the most recent patch on EQVault.  <br/>
<br/>
Those bard related:<br/>
<br/>
A fix for Selos Consonant Chain.  The exact wording is &quot;that it will now<br/>
work<br/>
better&quot;.  Can anyone confirm if it is now working the way it did before the<br/>
previous patch or if it now has a higher success rate?   <br/>
<br/>
There is also mention that a bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed and<br/>
that<br/>
spells will now affect more monsters.  I guess its possible that our songs<br/>
are<br/>
included in this also.  Sure hope this doesn&#39;t mean even more problems with<br/>
the<br/>
z-axis bug.<br/>
<br/>
Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria has been fixed.  I&#39;m only 22d level so am not<br/>
aware<br/>
of what the problem was.</div>
