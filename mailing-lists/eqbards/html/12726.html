<b>Subject:</b> Re: Runed Bone Fork...... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-467127873">So my story on the runed bone fork...<br/>
<br/>
   I knew I needed one for an upcoming dragon event, so I asked around<br/>
   for one.  I had just spent about 4 hours in Oggok killing bouncers<br/>
   with a friend and we had accumulated around 500pp each, so I had<br/>
   some dough to spend.<br/>
<br/>
   I asked people the going price for them, and got answers between 50pp<br/>
   and 150pp.  So I started auctioning for one.  Got nothing.<br/>
<br/>
   A friend just told me he had one, and he would trade me for it.<br/>
<br/>
   I offered my useless Staff of Withering, and he jumped on it.<br/>
   A much better deal for him, than I.  Those staves are worth<br/>
   a lot more than the fork. <br/>
<br/>
   Then greed set in.<br/>
<br/>
   He&#39;s like that&#39;s cool, but I really need a good robe.<br/>
<br/>
   I had several green silk drapes in the bank I was trying to<br/>
   get rid of (useless to me).  So I offered the drape for the<br/>
   fork.  He was estatic.  As he should be, hell that drape is<br/>
   worth a whole lot more than the fork.<br/>
<br/>
   Then more greed set in.<br/>
<br/>
   He&#39;s like that&#39;s awesome, but can you get me that Robe of <br/>
   Enshourdment, I really need that.<br/>
<br/>
   At the same time, I just zoned into Innothule, and auctioned<br/>
   for the fork.  Got one reply, the guy asked me what it was<br/>
   worth to me, and I told him I hate overinflating prices of<br/>
   things just because people expect L50s to have 1000s of plat.<br/>
   I told him at most it was worth 150pp.  He told me great, where<br/>
   do we meet to trade.  I /who&#39;d him, and he was L21... I thought<br/>
   great I&#39;ll be here all day waiting for him to find me.<br/>
<br/>
   I gave him the loc, and less than 1 min later, the guy is poking<br/>
   me.  Needless to say, I gave him 150pp for the fork, and another<br/>
   150pp for delivering it so fast.<br/>
<br/>
   Never did send a tell to the person I was dealing with earlier.<br/>
   He would have definitely made out in the long run, had he not<br/>
   gotten so greedy.  Ah well, that&#39;s the morale of the story ;)<br/>
<br/>
   Harm.</div>
