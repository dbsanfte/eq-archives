One of the valid points that Abashi made about that duel and the warrior<br/>
losing repeatedly was that the pet was equipped with dual FS daggers.  This<br/>
added a Haste component to the pet that the warrior apparently did not have.<br/>
Abashi rightly said that either the warrior should have been Hasted or the<br/>
pet should not have been equipped with daggers for that test.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; No, Abashi is correct on this point.  A L49 pet requires words<br/>
&gt; and components which are very rare and difficult to obtain -<br/>
&gt; roughly as difficult as or rarer than equipment like the FBSS.<br/>
&gt; A lot of the high level mages and necros are using lower level<br/>
&gt; pets because they simply haven&#39;t obtained the items needed for<br/>
&gt; their higher level pet spells.  So the correct comparison is<br/>
&gt; between L49 pet and L49 warrior with equipment typical for<br/>
&gt; that level.  (Actually, the correct comparison would be L49<br/>
&gt; necro and L49 pet vs L49 warrior.  We&#39;re already being<br/>
&gt; massively conservative comparing the warrior to just the pet.)<br/>
