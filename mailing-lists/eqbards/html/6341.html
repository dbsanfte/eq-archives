<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066626152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Of course, its SOOOO frustrating when someone who<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other night in Highpass fighting Orcs, I was grouped with a bunch of<br/>
other 17-19ish players (Im an 18th Bard) and one 14th Druid.  Every time we<br/>
engaged the Orcs, the druid would but up front playing tank and getting<br/>
beaten down to within an inch of his life.  Burning out all of his mana and<br/>
asking the rest of the group to wait while he meditated.  And most<br/>
importantly,, unable to heal the other tanks in the party when the need<br/>
arose.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know that when I group with all players that are much higher than I,<br/>
that I must be carefull and accept a slightly more supportive role.  Buffing<br/>
and Healing the Higer level players is a priority over diving into combat<br/>
and knocking myself down to less than a bubble of healh and becoming a time<br/>
burdon to the rest of the party.  I have a responsibility to the rest of a<br/>
higher level party to not deminish my resources, because the reason they<br/>
would have me in a party in the first place is because Bards rule. <br/>
<br/>
Well I had a little talk with him about how I thought he should approach the<br/>
situation with his Druid.  We was really defensive, probably because he was<br/>
getting stomped, and did not want to be hasseled.  I was upset to and was<br/>
probably not as &quot;hearts and flowers&quot; as I could have been about it.  I can<br/>
also testify that if I was to hear something other than a kind reminder like<br/>
&quot;Heal song please :)&quot; I would probably take offence too.  Considering I have<br/>
spend quite a bit of time trying to learn the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of my<br/>
character.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. sorry mr. Druid wherever you are.  Next time I just wont group with<br/>
you :))<br/>
