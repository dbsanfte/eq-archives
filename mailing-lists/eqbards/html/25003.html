<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248681355">Ok, I want to thank everyone for their help. I finally got my last crushed<br/>
coral yesterday and finished my Thurg quest. I then proceeded to complete<br/>
the extra little task to get the custom helm. I can not recall the name of<br/>
the NPC, but if you have a quest helm from a Kael helm drop you can do this<br/>
also. The NPC is located in a room to the left of Dain in Icewell Keep. Just<br/>
ask the 3 NPC in that room &quot;what helm?&quot; and he well tell you what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now that I have gone with the crazy looking Helm, tell me what you think<br/>
of the look.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a picture of my new helm. Btw, I hope I don&#39;t get in trouble for<br/>
posting a file, but I made it a pretty small in size.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t laugh too hard :-)<br/>

Thanks all,<br/>
