&gt;Lullaby doesnt seem to stack with anything nor does charm effetcively - at<br/>
&gt;least it seems to wear off really fast for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lullaby can stack it&#39;s just that any attack against the slept creature will <br/>
wake it up.  With how this song has been downgraded though you really do <br/>
need to keep it going continuously to be effective.<br/>
<br/>
Charm can be woven with other songs, but due to its random nature it is not <br/>
a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Specifically, does Fulfils Curtailing NOT stack with any songs or other<br/>
&gt;spells other players cast.  In fact that would be also a good addition to <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my experience Curtailing chant does stack with the Enchanter MR debuffs.  <br/>
I have never received any party members saying that they could not cast a <br/>
spell on something that was under this songs influence.  Can you give an <br/>
example so I can include it in the song analysis?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;analysis matrix - what spells are not compatible with various songs and <br/>
&gt;vice<br/>
&gt;versa.  Ie: chains will break, root, snare and cancel darkness and the DoT;<br/>
&gt;invis will kill pets; pulse songs that kill others invis; bellow will break<br/>
&gt;a a mezzed mob, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of this are what I would consider common game knowledge (ie invis <br/>
killing pets, Bellow breaking mesmerize since it is an attack).  I did <br/>
mention the snare breaks root, but should have mentioned that it can kill <br/>
darkness line DoT&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean some of these things I know - but is there a definitive collection <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;this knowledge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;John, what can i say - lots of wisps and oh yeah lots and lots of fire<br/>
&gt;beetles!! &lt;s&gt;<br/>
