<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121590748">Here is what I posted to my guild re: the bard quest wep:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;If it takes 2 dragon scales to get this thing vs using those same scales<br/>
(and time and effort to obtain same) for warrior quests, I&#39;d think we&#39;d be<br/>
better off equiping our warriors with weapons that they can use as opposed<br/>
to a cute toy that a bard might equip in the off-hand when he&#39;s not using<br/>
his drum. Instruments, especially the Dragon grade ones eg: Selo&#39;s Drums,<br/>
are still the &quot;uber&quot; bard weapons for both damage as well as buffs and<br/>
resists.&quot;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Verant should have made an instrument good enough so that even Shada would<br/>
use it (instead of swords &lt;g&gt;) -- now that would be &quot;Uber&quot; - truly.  The<br/>
mention of it being an &quot;off-hand weapon&quot; is from Aftathott&#39;s evaluation of<br/>
the wep and it&#39;s proc. <br/>
<br/>
What good is &quot;The Vision&quot; when it makes you blind to some basic things:<br/>
Bards, songs, instruments.  Because instruments are class specific to bards,<br/>
they should be _the_ defining items for us.  Some combination of songs and<br/>
instruments should be the focus of the bard&#39;s power and be the basis of our<br/>
power - imho.  I guess I should be mad or dissappointed at Verant but I am<br/>
some where between &quot;numb&quot; and uninterested.  Was it said in the design<br/>
meeting: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s *make* bards compete with warriors for their quest<br/>
items - that fits with the part of the Vision where...&quot;, or was it: &quot;Shit!<br/>
Tell them to delay the update!!  We forgot to make a quest for bards - let&#39;s<br/>
give &#39;em some kinda sword with musical notes floating around...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly, the bard!~ <br/>
