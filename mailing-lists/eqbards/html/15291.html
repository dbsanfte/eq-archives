&gt; I regretfully tell you that I was a couple of levels below level 15 when the<br/>

&gt; pre-nerf.  My experience with lullaby even at level 15 was that &quot;it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; great taunt song&quot;.  I&#39;ve never been able to reliably crowd control to this<br/>
&gt; date.  I guess when I get charm in four more levels I&#39;ll be able to control<br/>
&gt; a crowd of three, but if pixie strike is as bugged as Lullaby I guess that<br/>
&gt; will be the best I will ever do.<br/>

My subjective impression is that Pixie Strike has been working<br/>
*slightly* better, but the duration has been shortened.  i.e.<br/>
I&#39;m getting enough successes that I can keep 1, sometimes 2<br/>
mobs slept, but rather than lasting the &quot;full 3 ticks&quot; like it<br/>
usually did before, it seems to be expiring early more often.  <br/>
Then again, it may be my having gained 2 levels since the last<br/>
time I really tried to control bats and bugs.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, maybe I&#39;ll try Lullaby next time we get two bats, just<br/>
to see how it works against L42ish mobs.  :)<br/>
