<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495160714">The only damage message I have ever gotten when I sing Psalm of Warmth is<br/>
&quot;Mob was burned&quot;. I have never gotten a text message in white saying the mob<br/>
took 5 pts of non-melee damage.  I get the white colored message when I have<br/>
the thorn shield up.  In the fight with two bards where I was singing Warmth<br/>
and the other was singing Cooling, I got the &quot;Mob was burned message&quot;.<br/>
Don&#39;t remember seeing the damage message for the Cooling song.  I would<br/>
guess it would say something like &quot;mob was frozen&quot;.  As a result, can&#39;t<br/>
confirm if the two songs cancelled out.  It would make sense that they did.<br/>
Guess I need to start using the log parser.<br/>

&gt;  Sure wish we got the white text message for our damage shields similar to<br/>
&gt; what you get when you have the druid thorn buff (not certain of exact<br/>
&gt; name).  With the thorn buff, it tells you how much non-melee damage the<br/>
&gt; mob took when they<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit you.  Anyone have an idea why we don&#39;t get a similar message?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You *do* get the same message.  If you weren&#39;t, I&#39;d take that<br/>
&gt; as a sign that they were canceling eaching other.<br/>
