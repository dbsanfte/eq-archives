Now we all agree that bards do not make a party - they make a<br/>
party better.<br/>

Now we just have to convince the rest of the world of this fact.<br/>

I had a similar argument regarding the usefullness of a bard with<br/>
a friend of mine who groups with other friends of mine who have<br/>
long since passed my grouping range (unlike some other people, I<br/>
cannot spend every waking moment playin EQ 8).<br/>
<br/>
Her party - SK, cleric, monk, warrior, enchanter.<br/>
Would she rather have, as an additional party member, a bard or<br/>
another class? <br/>
Answer: I&#39;d like another tank.<br/>

People just don&#39;t seem to realise the immense value a bard can<br/>
bring to a well balance party (or even one that is not so well-<br/>
balanced!).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, playing a bard when your party is mob-chasing is<br/>
dangerous at best - everything that is not being attacked by<br/>
the party (and in a good party I believe this will be everything<br/>
except the ONE creature being attacked) will attack the bard.<br/>
This makes it necessary for the other party members to divert<br/>
their attacks from the primary target of the moment and get the<br/>
attention of the ones waiting to die, who are attacking the poor<br/>
bard.<br/>
<br/>
This is the main weakness to a bard as I see it.<br/>
If your party is taking on monoliths, then you have no problem, but<br/>
in a mob-hunt, you are dead meat.<br/>
