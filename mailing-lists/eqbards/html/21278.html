<div id="ygrps-yiv-8695465">IMO, wouldn&#39;t even consider UO or AC as an alternative to EQ.  Why?<br/>
<br/>
Well if pre-release hype is any indication, then Anarchy Online is going to<br/>
be a really good game.  AO will have one feature that looks very promising<br/>
in regards to quests.  When a player/group receives a quest, then a special<br/>
dungeon (or whatever term they will use in AO) will be created that only the<br/>
player/group who recieved the quest can enter.  No camping for items,<br/>
fighting over spawn points, or killstealing concerns.  This feature will<br/>
promote dungeon crawling as a standard form of adventuring.  The only<br/>
problem is that there are no bards in AO, which I guess is appropriate since<br/>
it is a science fiction setting.  AO is in beta now and should be released<br/>
before year end.  <br/>
<br/>
Most likely candidate replacement for EQ for those who like to play bards is<br/>
UO2.  The developers haven&#39;t released a lot of details on skills, but they<br/>
have said that there will be over 1000 different skills.  You would think<br/>
that a few of those skills are bardic in nature.  One thing they have<br/>
confirmed is that players will be able to select specific &quot;leadership&quot;<br/>
skills which will convey a bonus to all the other players in the group.  So<br/>
that means that the base code does contain ways for a player to affect/buff<br/>
the entire party.  I subscribe to the UO2 developers mailing list and bards<br/>
in UWOO (thats what it is actually called not UO2) is a popular topic.  If<br/>
OSI/EA releases specific info on how bards will work in UWOO, I&#39;ll forward<br/>
them to this list.<br/>

Correction:  I&#39;ll do some Wall-hunting in Qeynos until I get banned, THEN I<br/>
will check on UO (or maybe AC)<br/>
