<div id="ygrps-yiv-954667045">Lambent Stones are LORE, they can be traded though.  They are NOT no drop. <br/>
they are the only items (minus the gems, of course) that are NOT no drop.<br/>
A barbarian shaman was giving them away in NK last night on Prexus whenever he<br/>
pulled one.  They are not rare either.  Just the EQ funky random # generator<br/>
playing tricks on some people.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
