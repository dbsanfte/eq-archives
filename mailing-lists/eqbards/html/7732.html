<div id="ygrps-yiv-803017360"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would like to know if there is significant benefit to agi and dex above<br/>
&gt; 120 and 130 levels - compared to 100-110.  With drum and chant, my dex<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
&gt; to like 160 (ya, I have some really insane stat boosting jewelry.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Of course with a drum and chant, you can&#39;t hit too hard anyway :)  I<br/>
have no specific tests to prove it, but it *seems* that I get more hits in<br/>
when My dex is above 130, compared to unbuffed 105.  Of course, we&#39;ve been<br/>
through the arguments about seeing what you want to see, so that&#39;s probably<br/>
a good portion of it.  I think the problem with testing, is I&#39;d have to duel<br/>
someone, not just go for mobs.  Maybe I&#39;ll talk a level 22 bard friend of<br/>
mine into a duel sometime this week, with and without buffs.<br/>
