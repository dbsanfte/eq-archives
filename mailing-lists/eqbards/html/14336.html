<div id="ygrps-yiv-873702328">Actually, at high levels it tends to balance the other way.  Its the casters<br/>
that tend to be less valuable and the tanks that really count.<br/>
Casters tend to get highly resisted at planes/dragons so do relativly little<br/>
damage.  High level warriors can hit for 100&#39;s and critical for 200&#39;s and<br/>
that kind of damage adds up.  Its always the tank group that gets the dragon<br/>
kill, and its always the gurlee casters that get thrown into a group with a<br/>
druid or shaman to fend for themselves if there&#39;s no extra clerics to waste<br/>
on them.  <br/>
Of course, we wouldn&#39;t even be able to get into PoS or PoH without wizzies,<br/>
so I guess they&#39;re good for something ;)<br/>

I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>
game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>
hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much harder,<br/>
and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>
playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>
classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>
