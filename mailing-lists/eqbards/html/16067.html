<div id="ygrps-yiv-855218217">I was actually only measuring your output.<br/>
<br/>
IE Lets say your doing Hymm, DOT, DOT <br/>
<br/>
For my example Hymm does 10 per tick with lute (thus 12 with 7 stringed)<br/>
DOT 1 does 10 per tick (12 with 7S)<br/>
DOT 2 does 20 per tick (24 with 7s)<br/>
<br/>
With normal mandolin, your output (every tick) is:<br/>
10 heal, 30 damage<br/>
<br/>
With 7S it would be:<br/>
12 heal, 36 dam<br/>
<br/>
Still only 20% increase.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are factoring in the reduction in fight time, thus reduction in<br/>
damage taken, the difference would be based on a ton of variables. Like<br/>
damage output of other people in the party, how well the damage is being<br/>
distributed among your party, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I think it all matters in how you measure it.  Pretty much the rule of<br/>
all statistics.<br/>
