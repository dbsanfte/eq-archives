long weekend.  I arrived 1 bubble from level 15 and left 2 bubbles<br/>
into level 16 after 2 evenings in Lake of Ill Omen.  It was a great<br/>
place for exp, especially since it wasn&#39;t even slightly crowded. (I&#39;m<br/>
used to making one level a week, not one a night!) We (3 of us)<br/>
basically had the entire west side of the river to ourselves, fighting<br/>
mostly non agressive mobs (the sabertooths conned ready to attack, but<br/>
I had them walk right through me on several occasions without aggroing<br/>
on us - very strange).  On the downside, the loot was so so, excluding<br/>
the occasional sabertooth fang, which sold for nearly 2pp each.<br/>
<br/>
Travelling from Firiona Vie to the lake wasn&#39;t too bad, with a SoW or<br/>
Selo&#39;s.  Just followed the northeast shore, and then the river to the<br/>
lake.  One time I managed to aggro 2 or 3 mobs (spiders, goblins?) on<br/>
the way, but they still did minimal damage.<br/>
<br/>
One lesson learned was made during the trip back.  After zoning to the<br/>
Timorous Deep, the boat makes 2 stops, not 1.  The first stop brings a<br/>
shuttle for an elven outpost, the 2nd is for Butcherblock.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
recall any stops on the trip from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie, so at<br/>
the first stop I got on the shuttle.  I then had to wait on the<br/>
shuttle, next to a dock until the next boat came, all the while<br/>
wondering if there were 2 boats.  Finally another boat came, I got on<br/>
and got off again at the next stop - happy to be back in Faydwer, for<br/>
now.<br/>
