<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600635479">Will be interesting indeed though perhaps painful as well.  It is just<br/>
incidents such as this which have in the past touched off hacker attacks on<br/>
various other internet sites.  Anyone remember the attacks that shut down<br/>
Amazon for a couple of days after they removed a controversial book from<br/>
their sales?<br/>

I&#39;ve read several of the threads on Whineplay as well (but not the actual<br/>
stories).  The entire situation does appear very bizarre.  Will be<br/>
interesting to see how it actually pans out.  One thing is for certain is<br/>
that Lum and Tweety are going to have fun with this.  <br/>

Yea I&#39;m just starting to read some of this thread.  Its pretty crazy.  I am<br/>
not someone who really gets excited about much, but this really irks.<br/>
Enough so to consider action.  The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>
EQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>
should organize a protest this weekend.  I might even show up for this one<br/>
:-)<br/>
