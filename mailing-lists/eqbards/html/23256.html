<div id="ygrps-yiv-775887476">Probably seems that way, because you&#39;re used to the usual crawl.  Maybe once<br/>
you&#39;re used to this, it too, will seem painfully slow.  :)<br/>

Just a thought...heh.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Unpopular view...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I played in Karnors last night with a warrior, cleric, monk, and <br/>
ranger... all I have to say is I earned as much exp in the two hours <br/>
I was there last night as I had in 6+ hour camps before (and the <br/>
group was not any better.)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else think maybe the exp is now coming too fast?<br/>
