<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093932885">BTW, while it&#39;s completely irrelevant to Bards, :) this is legit, and if you<br/>
have any interest in this kind of stuff, you should do it. I&#39;ve been doing<br/>
it with no problems encountered. I leave my computer at work on overnight,<br/>
and what the heck, if I can help out the SETI program at no cost or<br/>
irritation to me, why not?<br/>

Why the hell is this on the Bards list, and why should I trust you, of all<br/>
people someone searching for the Marvin the Martian?<br/>

    This is guaranteed not to be a stupid (or even a funny!) joke; and it&#39;s<br/>
guaranteed to be a worthy cause and it&#39;s guaranteed to be real (not an<br/>
Internet urban legend like warnings of the Good Times Virus)...<br/>
 <br/>
    In case you haven&#39;t heard about this (or did but don&#39;t know the URL) - a<br/>
project is underway to get ordinary people with computers and an Internet<br/>
connection to help on the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)<br/>
Project.  You know - just like Jody Foster in the movie Contact!  A<br/>
satellite in Puerto Rico has captured radio waves and they need computers to<br/>
analyze the data for signs of intelligence via radio transmissions.<br/>
 <br/>
    Unless you have a REALLY fast computer - you will set it up as a screen<br/>
saver - so it will only kick in when you&#39;re not using your computer.  When<br/>
it&#39;s done calculating - it will connect to the Internet, upload the results<br/>
and download new data for your machine to analyze.  The analysis is quite<br/>
time-consuming.  On my 300 MHz Machine it took 73 hours 35 minutes to<br/>
complete a unit of work.  There are version for both Windows and Macs (and<br/>
Unix and Linux and a  bunch of others).<br/>
 <br/>
    Anyway - unless you REALLY need a cool snazzy looking Screen saver that<br/>
you paid a lot of bucks for - you can participate in an exciting research<br/>
project at no cost to you. If you use your computer a lot like I do - it&#39;s<br/>
really better just to leave it on all the time (newer machines have power<br/>
saving features such as shutting your C Drive down for example) and this<br/>
will really help the project as it will run while you are doing things like<br/>
sleeping or are at work...<br/>
