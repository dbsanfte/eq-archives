&gt; OK speaking from experience here.  Our underwater breathing (UB) song does<br/>
&gt; not override Enduring Breath (EB).  If EB is up and you start singing UB,<br/>
EB<br/>
&gt; will still be up when you stop singing.  However, if you are singing UB<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have EB, EB will not stick if someone tries to cast it on you.<br/>
&gt; You have to stop UB first in order to get EB to stick.  While in Kedge, I<br/>
&gt; always have UB memmed.  Whenever someone announces EB is dropping, I get<br/>
UB<br/>
&gt; ready in case they start drowning.  Saved a 50 paladin the other night<br/>
&gt; because of it.  To say the least he was glad I had it ready.<br/>

&gt; Note to Laluni:  I&#39;ll be in Kedge tonight around 9PM PST if I can get a<br/>
ride<br/>
&gt; from Ogguk.  Hope to see you and the rest of DoH there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Speaking of kedge... any of you know if our water breathing song<br/>
overrides<br/>
&gt; &gt; enduring breath?  In other<br/>
&gt; &gt; words.  I&#39;d like to keep it memed in case of emergencies, but will it<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause everyone else&#39;s enduring<br/>
&gt; &gt; breath&#39;s do fade when the 10 seconds are up?<br/>
