<br/>
I&#39;d trade the Kisch for any cleric quest armor - esp bracers, cenobite belt<br/>
(I&#39;d have to prolly add something), or that +wis neck thing from kunark that<br/>
clerics can wear.  Let me know.  Gimme a shout this weekend - in any case.<br/>
<br/>
I had heard that Koral (with the lute/drum) was a pretty rare spawn and I<br/>
just like getting rare items from names &lt;eg&gt;.  I remember when I was like<br/>
level 19 and &quot;went back&quot; to Steamfont, BB, Lfay to visist old haunts and<br/>
extract some revenge on old enemys (minos, qued & his bandit pals, the<br/>
sisters.)  Running the path in L-Fay, I got attacked by some bug and when I<br/>
conned it: Crookstinger!  Woo hoo!  I solo&#39;d a green and got a procing<br/>
weapon!<br/>

&gt; Well, grats on the Kisch :P I traded mine and now kinda wish I still<br/>
&gt; had it now<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am curious why you were so excited about getting the Sharkskin Drum<br/>
&gt; after getting the Tamborine though. </span></blockquote></div>
