&gt;Mine is 95.  I suspect the difference is in our sensitivity to<br/>
&gt;this type of thing.  Some people don&#39;t mind a bit of<br/>
&gt;arcadishness in their RPGs, others do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hahaha!  I actually very rarely fail to start up a song.  And you assume I<br/>
like bashing keys, heheh, like I am used to an RPG that uses a Track & Field<br/>
mentality (eh, remember that old Arcade game, the upright monster where<br/>
people would make little guys run my wambing the machine real hard?  Ah that<br/>
sound was deafening, would echo through the entire damned mall. And,<br/>
incidently, I always sucked at that damn button breaking game!)<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I am surprised by this whole discussion, for though much bothers<br/>
me in EQ generally, I have noticed no difference in failure rates,<br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a definite BUG at work here, friends!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 21 Wood Elf and my modified stats are (with an instrument<br/>
wielded) 87-str, 65-sta, 102-agi, 104-dex, 80-wis, 100-chr.  Hardily<br/>
extroadinary by any means!<br/>
<br/>
I ran a test, which I&#39;m sure Mr. Kim would appreciate.  Just one test,<br/>
didn&#39;t take too long.  I started up Accelerando one hundred times and noted<br/>
the failure rates.  I was hoping to keep my failures noted on one hand, but<br/>
by the end I had missed a note a mere six times, yep, had to switch to my<br/>
other hand to keep track, hard with a mouse.<br/>
<br/>
Six missed notes in one hundred attempts to sing accelerando (I wielded a<br/>
lute just because that&#39;s what I happened to have in my hand).  As you can<br/>
see, I have no problems with missed notes.<br/>
<br/>
I believe you should all bring this to Verant&#39;s attention immedietly!!  /BUG<br/>
this!!! Because I am apparently missing a hell of a lot less notes, at a<br/>
much lower level, that the rest of you!<br/>
