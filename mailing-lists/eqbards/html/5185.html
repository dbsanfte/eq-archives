<div id="ygrps-yiv-663964994">For the sake of a data set, I&#39;ve got a 36th bard on Tarew Marr.<br/>
<br/>
Something else of note, of the 15/100 that I did get for Celerity, about 8<br/>
of those were in a row.  As I mentioned before, the random number generator<br/>
seems to have a habit of generating failures fairly well clumped together so<br/>
the feeling of more failures might come from this, but if you watch over a<br/>
larger set, the %&#39;s still come out correctly (i.e. 5 in a row out of 100 is<br/>
still 5%, even though it seems &#39;bad&#39; when you&#39;re in that clump).<br/>

&gt;Could the missed notes only happens on certain server(s)?  I am a lv 44<br/>

&gt;&gt;It&#39;s very possible that there is a bug but it does not affect everyone the<br/>
&gt;&gt;same way.<br/>
