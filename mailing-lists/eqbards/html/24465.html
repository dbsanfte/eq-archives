You, personally, don&#39;t have to do damage to a creature to be <br/>
summoned.  The creature just has to have been damaged.  I tested this <br/>
recently with another Bard while testing out some theories on beating <br/>
Gorenaire. :)<br/>
<br/>
What this means, tho, is that if someone trains you with their half <br/>
dead mob, you may have a hard time getting away.  Good thing is, it <br/>
will probably require them being summoned and killed first, before <br/>
you&#39;ll be at the top of the Hate list. :)<br/>
