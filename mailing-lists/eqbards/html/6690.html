intentional.  You can&#39;t tell when Verant is being appropriately mysterious<br/>
so people will properly figure things out in game from when they have their<br/>
heads so far up their nether regions that haven&#39;t a clue what&#39;s going on<br/>
either.<br/>

Given their ongoing behavior, I tend to credit them more often with the<br/>
latter than the former.<br/>
