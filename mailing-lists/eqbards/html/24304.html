<div id="ygrps-yiv-264401732">Ya, I knew that.  Actually, you don&#39;t even have to click to pause it, <br/>
you can just click done and come back.  But, once you log, you have <br/>
to start a new game.  But why would multiplayer be pointless?  In my <br/>
mind, they would just make it so you have to start a new game with <br/>
another player so that both are starting fresh.  I think that it <br/>
would be fun :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that they added Gems.  I know a while back, many players <br/>
were requesting casinos in towns so that they can gamble and play <br/>
games.  They said that it would be too buggy and exploitable <br/>
possibly, but I think that Gems (and other possible future games) is <br/>
a good compromise.  The best things I can see about it are...  Camps <br/>
will become much less boring, when you still have to stare at the <br/>
spell books with pre-35 casters, waiting for group <br/>
assignments/buffing on raids, etc.  Although, like you said.  People <br/>
can die if they aren&#39;t paying attention and just playing Gems.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure if this works if you re-log.<br/>

&gt; Worryingly enough, I saw a group in Karnors almost get wiped out <br/>
last night<br/>
&gt; because their Enchanter was busy playing gems while medding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Why do you keep saying that you can play non stop.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;understand what you are saying.  Do you mean that there is a way <br/>
&gt;to make<br/>
&gt; it so the game doesn&#39;t reset when you log?  I&#39;m &gt;confused. </span></blockquote></div>
