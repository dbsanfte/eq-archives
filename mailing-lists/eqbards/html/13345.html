&gt;   The message will still display, but the ice giant will keep on<br/>
&gt;   swinging.  You cannot stun, mez, or otherwise hold those things<br/>
&gt;   still unless it&#39;s your pet.  They just shrug it off, otherwise.<br/>
&gt;   A good example of this for bards is pixie strike, try pixieing<br/>
&gt;   a giant, you&#39;ll get the glaze over message and the giant will <br/>
&gt;   keep on trucking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really hope this is due to that missing resist message bug.  <br/>
It&#39;s really stupid making a mob immune to a spell effect, and<br/>
not giving the players a resist/immune message.<br/>
