&gt; &gt;No, it doesn&#39;t work on the Squad Ring.  :-)  Though my hunch<br/>

&gt; Nope, it won&#39;t.  Squad ring quest is based on a specific number of<br/>
&gt; necklaces/belts (this was confirmed by a *very* high level player from<br/>
&gt; Beta, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We discussed this on the monk list.  Apparently the way it<br/>
works is that each necklace/belt you turn in raises your<br/>
faction, each time you kill Mooto raises your faction, each<br/>
time you kill Gunrich lowers your faction.  Once you get<br/>
enough faction, you get the ring.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a potential abuse - give the ring to your friends and<br/>
get another one.  This is (I&#39;m told by someone who has<br/>
completed the quest) made unworkable because each time you get<br/>
a new ring, you *lose* faction thus requiring you to turn in<br/>
more necklaces/belts to raise your faction again to get<br/>
another ring.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the ring is a low-level quest, I don&#39;t see what<br/>
being a high level player from beta has to do with it.  :-)<br/>
