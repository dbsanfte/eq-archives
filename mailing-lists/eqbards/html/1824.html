rather long delay on it.  They could&#39;ve given it to as a skill<br/>
that cycled every hour or so (like Lay Hands), but it makes<br/>
more sense to make it a song and use mana to incorporate the<br/>
delay.  (They could&#39;ve just greyed out the song icon until the<br/>
time had cycled, but then you&#39;d end up memorizing the song,<br/>
thinking &quot;#&!@ it still hasn&#39;t cycled,&quot; and forgetting it for<br/>
another song.)<br/>
<br/>
Several combat skills (e.g. monk special attacks) are<br/>
exclusive of each other - if you use one, it starts the delay<br/>
timer for all.  Having multiple one-shot bard songs which used<br/>
mana would be the same thing, except we have a nice blue<br/>
progress bar showing when we can use it again instead of<br/>
having to glance at our watch and note the time every time we<br/>
use it.<br/>
<br/>
The *only* reason I&#39;d like meditate is so that it doesn&#39;t take<br/>
us 10 times longer to memorize a song than it does for a<br/>
spellcaster to memorize spells (if you haven&#39;t played a<br/>
spellcaster, you auto-meditate when memorizing and the bar<br/>
moves in huge increments of about 20% - takes about 4 seconds<br/>
to memorize the most difficult spell you have).  When my<br/>
cleric friend and I died, she memorized her spells, conjured<br/>
up a new hammer of wrath, crossed two zones to get from the<br/>
bank to the gate (where I was), and I was still memorizing my<br/>
songs.  Surely after memorizing these songs so often, we&#39;d get<br/>
pretty good at it?  Just one point in meditate - that won&#39;t<br/>
help mana regeneration will it?  Please please pretty please?<br/>
