that the folks doing the camping have moved well beyond the need for the<br/>
item themselves, pretty self-defeating.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I love about EQ above all else - is the benefits and incentives<br/>
of cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
This is one area (really the only one I&#39;ve noticed) that goes against that<br/>
model (and only in certain instances).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also one that&#39;s big on the economic side of a world like this - if<br/>
given the option between warrior and merchant - I&#39;d pick merchant every<br/>
time, hands down - now in EQ - gotta be both....ok.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the post I saw about total group damage in terms of looting rights -<br/>
that sounds promising - true, a group of high levels could effectively<br/>
block out a spot, however, I doubt you&#39;d find high levels grouping for this<br/>
purpose nearly as often as lower level guys for an item - high levels have<br/>
better things to do.<br/>
<br/>
My original post only suggested that lore items equipped in inventory slots<br/>
not count towards the limit total - this will have a benefit to appropriate<br/>
level players - and will be of very little difference for higher level<br/>
players that have moved onto better equipment. It still allows them one for<br/>
merchant purposes - which is not at all unacceptable to me from a<br/>
merchant&#39;s point of view - but it still only allows one in the inventory or<br/>
bank for resale at a time.</div>
