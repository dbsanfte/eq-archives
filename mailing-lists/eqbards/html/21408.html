<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635809318">I can just see this (try to think about it) ;)<br/>
<br/>
If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>
every group should love to have one.<br/>
But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>
<br/>
So something is wrong, and i know that&#39;s not the &quot;a bard can hardly find a<br/>
group&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing to say more.<br/>

Well, although it was one of the most thoughtful posts I have seen in a long<br/>
time, it got the usual treatment from VI.  Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those playing it, I<br/>
think that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many<br/>
things, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards<br/>
excell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>
important though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you look at it as a<br/>
walking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can do to make you<br/>
feel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>
complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support<br/>
class. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you<br/>
are happy with that role is up to you. <br/>
<br/>

Pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets from saving a<br/>
comrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of knowing that the<br/>
druid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you stood around and<br/>
played mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>
meant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support other&#39;s efforts.<br/>
They should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>
