<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-319871213">According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances of<br/>
raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of getting<br/>
a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>
downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas sadly.<br/>
