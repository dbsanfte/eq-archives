<div id="ygrps-yiv-87196338">I think you were unwittingly a victim of the charm bug that I reported a<br/>
couple of weeks ago.  I fought the giants last night and their agro radius<br/>
was unchanged.  However, there is a known bug with charm that causes you to<br/>
get on the hate list of every giant in chase range.  I have yet to encounter<br/>
the bug with my charm, but every time our enchanter charms one the bug<br/>
occurs.  It basically turns the agro radius of all those giants into their<br/>
chase range and you get faction hits for every giant anyone kills in the<br/>
area.  bleh!  We had a GM take copious notes and report it.  As soon as my<br/>
song pulsed on the affected enchanter I was added to all those hate lists as<br/>
well.  My charm worked normally but maybe if their had been another bard it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have.  I could charm one gate spawn giant and he would come right<br/>
over to me.  If I sent him against the other gate spawn giant I did not get<br/>
added to any other giants hate lists like the enchanter did.<br/>

The only change I noticed in Frontier Mts, fighting Mountain giants was<br/>
their new agro radius.  It is HUGE.  I mean further than you can see in the<br/>
rain huge.  I used to amazed how small their agro radius was, now I can&#39;t<br/>
within range of chains (my normal pull song) of the front gates without the<br/>
inside giants (not the gate guards) agroing on me!<br/>
