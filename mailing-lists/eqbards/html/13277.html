<br/>
  What about your bard? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  And are you one of those shaman who don&#39;t keep a leash on their pups?<br/>
  /grrr  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  We got majorly trained again the other night when a frenzied spirit<br/>
  did just that; it frenzied and pulled like 3 spite golems and 2 <br/>
  clerics.  I would have disciplined the pup had it not died.<br/>
<br/>
  Multiple mob scenario, 5 bards, guess who were the first bodies on <br/>
  the floor?  I hope they implement meditate soon, I die way too often<br/>
  these days.  Someone here said you can hold the meditate button or<br/>
  press it a bunch to speed up memming, that doesn&#39;t work.  I tried it.<br/>
