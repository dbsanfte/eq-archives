&gt;   Your chains wont matter,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chains does matter, I always keep it handy for emergency runner control.  <br/>
Remember our BIG advantage in snaring runners 1) We can &#39;cast&#39; while <br/>
running. 2) We can start it when the target is out of sight and only have to <br/>
be in sight when is finishes casting. 3)We NEVER are OOM. and 4) We can <br/>
&#39;cast&#39; while running.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Still using charm at 39th, great for saving that party member that is at <br/>
half a bubble, or pulling the Dar off the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;pixie strike doesnt hold monsters well enough,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>who cares about holding them? When I can interrupt the casting of froglok <br/>
wizard 90% of the time with a well placed pixie strike I am a happy camper.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh I never play mana song alone unless I am being lazy, you can weave it <br/>
with on other song without losing effect.  You can even do it with 2 songs + <br/>
mana and still get 80% of the effect of playing mana song alone.  Do not <br/>
listen to greedy casters that say play mana only unless you want to 8)<br/>
