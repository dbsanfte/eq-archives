<div id="ygrps-yiv-234339415">That was the link!   Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
So how did I (and other women) get interested in EQ if the marketting is<br/>
all geared toward men?  Desire to *be* Firiona?  No way.  Everyone&#39;s<br/>
different, but I can&#39;t imagine most women would be drawn to her.   Think<br/>
about the covers of the four boxes.  On three of them, Firiona&#39;s not even<br/>
doing anything.  If she were in my group I&#39;d say &quot;Quit standing around,<br/>
[explative],  and come help us!  We&#39;ve got a battle going on here!&quot;  The<br/>
one cover she&#39;s not just standing around on she&#39;s chained up.  Great!  Just<br/>
the person I&#39;d want to play with!  Doesn&#39;t help the group at all and then<br/>
goes and gets herself into trouble and needs to be rescued.  Gah!  Leave to<br/>
the lizard!<br/>
<br/>
Course, that bard on the first box wasn&#39;t much better.  She was probably<br/>
singing, yes, but empty handed?  Play or fight, sister!<br/>
<br/>
Or am I starting to need a life more than David Kennerly?<br/>
