&lt;&lt; Personally I don&#39;t like being &quot;ordered&quot; to do anything in a group, by <br/>
leader<br/>
 or other members.  They do not play a bard, therefore they can not know all<br/>
 of our benefits to a party.  If the group asks and we agree on a strategy,<br/>
 no problem.  but if it pisses you off like it does me to be ordered around,<br/>
 just tell them &quot;next time you tell me to play that song will be the last<br/>
 time i play it.&quot;  usually that shuts them up, especially if it is the mana<br/>
 song =) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know , i hate this too . its my biggest pet peeve when someone getting <br/>
their butt whipped by a were bat , starts yelling &quot;heal song ....HEAL SONG&quot; <br/>
etc.. it gets so aggravating , i have to explain after that it wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
much for them even if i did sing it.  I usually leave a group if they do that <br/>
, i get too annoyed .</div>
