&gt; I&#39;m not saying that these aren&#39;t useful for inturrupting spells.  Its just<br/>
&gt; been my experience that it doesn&#39;t make their head actually nod, or their<br/>
&gt; eyes glaze over.  They get hit with the spell, and are still able to carry<br/>
&gt; out their regular business whereas a MOB will sleep for a few pulses.  I<br/>

night (my paladin friends were camping Ghoulbane - we&#39;ve been<br/>
at it on and off for 5 levels now and only have one sword to<br/>
show for it, and most everything there is green to us now).<br/>
<br/>
About 30% of the time I&#39;d resist it (my MR is 35).<br/>
<br/>
About 60% of the time the spell would take hold (no resist<br/>
message, icon appeared on my screen and stayed there), but<br/>
would have no effect.<br/>
<br/>
About 10% of the time, it would work and I&#39;d be stunned from<br/>
5-15 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Either PCs are really good at immediately breaking out of it<br/>
(maybe the latest PvP changes?), or it&#39;s buggy.  I do not<br/>
recall having this much trouble getting it to stick on me when<br/>
I first played around with it after I got it.  It was either<br/>
resist or stunned.<br/>
