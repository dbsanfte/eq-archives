<b>Subject:</b> Why EQ is so buggy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-153107548">It sounds like many of you on this list are in the technical field as either DBAs, developers or Architects (I&#39;m an architect).  I found this nice little coding guideline that I&#39;m pretty sure Verant uses to write EQ given the sheer number of bugs that are present and the volume at which new bugs are introduced...<br/>
<br/>
Only thing missing in this is Verant&#39;s obvious lack of a solid source control environment or misuse of what they have.<br/>
