<div id="ygrps-yiv-290293509">I believe so - I&#39;ve heard anecdotal reports of other classes getting this<br/>
but its much rarer.<br/>
<br/>
A possible explanation - I think the hate range is greater than agro - so<br/>
mobs can add you to your hate range that you never fight.  We are pulsing a<br/>
6x buff to our parties in downtime - where as other classes that buff are<br/>
doing it once every so often - so the odds are less that they&#39;ll get on a<br/>
hate list - and will be on fewer hate lists.<br/>

Out of curiousity, do DOTs work this way too?  That is, if a shaman I&#39;m<br/>
grouped with hit&#39;s something with a DOT and the bugger runs off, spreading<br/>
the hate, and the shaman camps out, do I get on the hate list for having<br/>
been grouped with the shaman?  Does the shaman get back on the hate list if<br/>
he then heals me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unrelated question:  I&#39;ve been invited to a Dalnir raid on the condition<br/>
that I can get into the high teens by February 3rd (oh how I laughed!).<br/>
Should hell freeze over and I make three or four levels in the next week,<br/>
is Dalnir&#39;s still going to be insanely difficult for me?<br/>
<br/>
This is a multi-group raid and I&#39;d be in the lowest level group - a full<br/>
group of low-teens/early-twenties.<br/>
<br/>
Evulia, 14.8 levels and crawling, Tunare<br/>
