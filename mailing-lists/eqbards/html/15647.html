<div id="ygrps-yiv-144650174">In higher level groups where people know each other, and the tanks are good at taunting, then one tank will be able to hold every mob on them (by switching targets) without everyone else switching targets.  I&#39;ve also experienced bigger groups of people (such as FG raids) where tanks tank individual FGs on bigger pulls, but eveyone assists one main tank.<br/>
At higher levels, when clerics are present, its a waste of mana to spread damage between more than 2 people.  Complete heal is inefficient when you only use it 5 times on 5 tanks that only need 2 bubbles of health as opposed to 3 times on 2 tanks that needed 10 bubbles of health between the two of them.  (that made no sense, but it works out right :)<br/>

  Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for everyone to<br/>
  /assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.  This stategy behind<br/>
  this is that it will reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the entire<br/>
  party.  I think it would be safe for me to say that almost every group I<br/>
  join follows this tactic when we fight.<br/>
<br/>
  The problem with this tactic is that, due to bard hate, it opens up the bard<br/>
  to bear the brunt of the damage from the mobs that aren&#39;t engaged.  This<br/>
  tactic also puts the groups healer at risk because unengaged mobs are likely<br/>
  to attack him as well.  <br/>
<br/>
  I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>
  actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>
  It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>
  damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>
  engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>
  speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>
  tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>
  they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>
<br/>
  Has anyone had a lot of experience fighting in groups that followed the<br/>
  second line of reasoning?  I&#39;d like to hear what your results were.<br/>
