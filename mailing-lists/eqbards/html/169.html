<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237341721">As I was practice my swimming in the small bathing pool near the wonderful<br/>
&#39;Theater of the Tranquil&#39; in Freeport. It is a good place to relax and<br/>
increase ones skill in swimming, I went from a 2 to a 18 in about 10<br/>
minutes. Anyway, as I was swimming I heard a desperate 4th level wizard<br/>
asking for help in finding his body. I felt I would help.<br/>
<br/>
	I met him at the west gate, and spoke which him. He had been ambushed by a<br/>
Kodak bear in the west commons. the attack had left him with nothing but his<br/>
spells. He asked for some food and help in finding his body. I gave some<br/>
iron rations and water. I was low my self, but I gave him what I could. the<br/>
run would be quick. I then used my Acceleration song and grouped with him so<br/>
we could run there faster and be able to outrun any danger.<br/>
<br/>
	Alas upon Reaching the divide at the edge of the west commons disaster hit.<br/>
My link to the server crashed. And I could not get back on. I tried for half<br/>
an hour! and nothing. I fear he was left in the western commons without<br/>
weapon, armor, or food other than the meager rations I gave. My heart sunk<br/>
into my boots...<br/>
<br/>
	I am sick over leaving him to fend for his self. I wish I knew what<br/>
happened to him. Did he try and succeed in finding his body?  Did he return<br/>
to the city and look for me? Or find another that could help him? Please if<br/>
anyone meets a 4th level wizard in the city of Freeport named Ceen, or hear<br/>
tell of him, Please let me know if he is OK. Or if possible, if you meet him<br/>
please tell him how sorry I am for being forced out of the realm, and that I<br/>
wish to make it up to him in some way. I am truly heart sick for losing my<br/>
ward, and feel very melancholy over abandoning him like that.<br/>
<br/>
	Alas I now fear helping others, for having the same happen to them. for I<br/>
have no way of telling him it was unavoidable. So please, if anyone can,<br/>
relay my message...<br/>
<br/>
