<div id="ygrps-yiv-287348581">Myself and a wizard friend sat around and tested it with a few different<br/>
tests.  We tested one bubble, 2 bubbles, and a OOM regen.  All of them were<br/>
timed the same, the song seems to make no difference.  We tested each 3<br/>
times, no song, song-no instrument, song-w/instrument.<br/>

&gt;Well, the tests I have seen described were not very rigorous in the testing<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;testing the time to full up a bubble at the beginning against a bubble near<br/>
