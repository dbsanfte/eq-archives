&gt; &gt; 2.    My other toon is a mage(20th Level) and he is now in<br/>
&gt; &gt; OOT soloing gargoyles. Can I do the same with my bard or will<br/>
&gt; &gt; the gargoyles rip me a new one?<br/>

&quot;toon - (n.) [Possibly a European term, from cartoons like &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; <br/>
who keep coming back every time they &#39;die&#39;.  More probably originated on <br/>
Sierra&#39;s original online world, The Realm.  The characters in the game, <br/>
while highly customizable, were very cartoonish - thus, the reference to <br/>
&quot;toons.&quot;] Any Player Character. e.g. &quot;Ya, I just started this new toon <br/>
tonight.&quot;&quot;<br/>
