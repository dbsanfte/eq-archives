<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061223647">If it&#39;s blue or better, your basic powergamer will camp it.  If its green<br/>
and slowing the spawn, your advanced powergamer will kill it.<br/>

This thing about druid faction and teleports is a bit over rated - ihmo!<br/>
The 3 most frequently used rings have no druids at them:  Lavastorm,<br/>
Butcherblock (hmm or does it???) and Feerott.  I spent a bunch of levels<br/>
with evil race players in my regular group.  We have tele&#39;d in to rings<br/>
_with_ druids and yes we get attacked.  And yes we run for the zone.  No<br/>
offense but your perspective is one from having played mostly or perhaps<br/>
only &#39;goodie&#39; races.  Come to the dark side and see.  A few guards, druids,<br/>
or merch&#39;s chasin&#39; you is just how it goes.  It happens and you zone.<br/>
<br/>
Your wood elf philosophy is a good one ;p Keep telling your self that &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I am not really on the dark side - ie I am not KOS in Qeynos or<br/>
Freeport or any of the goodie cities - but my picture is on the wall in the<br/>
post office of Ogg hehe I will tell you that!  But both Qeynos and Freeport<br/>
have quests that are &quot;goodie&quot; that can or absolutely will make you KOS to<br/>
corrupt guards and merch&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Dark races seem to have a lot more variety of stuff to kill.  <br/>

IMO, any bard who kills treants is making life unnecessarily hard on<br/>
themselves.<br/>
I have been told killing treants lowers your faction with druids (and don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
to test it to find out:-).  Assuming that it is true, if you decide to kill<br/>
treants you most likely wont be able to use the druid rings for group<br/>
teleporting.  I&#39;ve got a druid friend who promised me free teleports for<br/>
life<br/>
because I located and recovered her corpse out of the lava in Sol A.  No way<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
gonna give that up in exchange for the money and EXP treants give.  Too many<br/>
other places in the game for that.  Plus, I&#39;m a wood elf from Kelethin.<br/>
Seems<br/>
kinda evil to go around killing sentient trees when the foundation of your<br/>
hometown is distantly related to them.  <br/>
