&gt;&gt; It just doesn&#39;t fit my idea of the classic bard. We are seldom portrayed as<br/>
&gt;&gt; tanks. We are singers of songs. Maybe even lifters of purses or players of<br/>
&gt;&gt; practical jokes. Light on our feet and quick about our wits.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree.  The way the game is designed, the bard will<br/>
usually end up taking the brunt of the damage in the party.  <br/>
We may not dish out much damage, but we sure take a lot of it.  <br/>
It is better for the entire party if the person taking the<br/>
most damage is encased in good armor.  The last few days of<br/>
playing at L17 have made this clear to me (I seem to be the<br/>
most common target for my paladin friends&#39; lay of hands).  <br/>
I&#39;m starting to experiment more with holding off my initial<br/>
attack until the monster(s) are fixated on someone else.  I&#39;m<br/>
also going to start spending most of my money upgrading all my<br/>
armor, something I&#39;ve been neglecting up til now.<br/>
