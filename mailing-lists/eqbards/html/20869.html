<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-152008293">I was in Wandering Minstrels for a while. This is the<br/>
all bard guild on Bristlebane.  And in my experience<br/>
it is great at lower lvls when you are learning how to<br/>
be a bard. (that was before I discovered this list<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
It does have disadvantages.  In the 2 or 3 months I<br/>
was in TWM there was one &quot;guild activity&quot; and it was<br/>
for lvl 25 and up.. I was 15 at the time.  I ended up<br/>
leaving because I wanted to be in a guild with the<br/>
people I ran around with.  (Interestingly enough one<br/>
other person left TWM shortly after I did to join my<br/>
guild and when it disbanded we are now in a third<br/>
guild together, and we often (lvl 7 to now lvl 34) <br/>
group together and sometimes with a third bard as<br/>
well)<br/>
<br/>
That being said, most ppl have alternates and an all<br/>
bard guild isnt bad as long as you have guild<br/>
alliances or friends in other places. <br/>
