<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136132658">I for one don&#39;t like the idea of bard&#39;s being able to bind themelves.  Just<br/>
me?  I have no trouble finding a bind anymore.  In the early days when I was<br/>
young and travelled as soon as I had accelerado, O how I hated the greedy<br/>
mages trying to gouge me for all the platinum I had saved.  But now those<br/>
greedy mages are level 40+ and normal folks don&#39;t even ask for payment.<br/>
Those normal folks get a platinum worth of fierce brew, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Give us binding, then give anyone who can bind Spirit of the Wolf, only fair<br/>
no?  Why not just give everyone every spell and skill then, I&#39;m certain an<br/>
argument could be made for every class to have any one thing.<br/>

And hope you don&#39;t have other characters named &quot;Rannger&quot; or &quot;Figghter&quot; heheh<br/>

&gt;First off, yeah my character&#39;s name is Barrd (Supposed to be &quot;Bard&quot;, but<br/>
&gt;that damned name filter...), which is a character I&#39;ve RP&#39;d since the good<br/>
&gt;old days of NWN.   So no need to &quot;Hey, great name ;ppp&quot; me, I&#39;ve already<br/>
&gt;heard it all =oP<br/>
&gt;Question, does anyone know if there is any plan in the future for bards to<br/>
&gt;be able to bind themselves?  Just kinda seems silly that we&#39;re supposed to<br/>
&gt;be the most traveling class in Norrath, but can&#39;t bind. =o/  Also, any word<br/>
&gt;on why Selo&#39;s disrupts other group member&#39;s SoW?<br/>
