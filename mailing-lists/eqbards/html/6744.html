&gt; I&#39;ve tried to use Divine Aura as a method to tank a creature, the<br/>
&gt; problem is that once you successfully cast it, you are moved to the<br/>
&gt; bottom of the creature&#39;s agression list.<br/>

&gt; afford to be singing celerity, chant of battle, and melee because<br/>
&gt; that causes so much anger that they die very quickly. Alot of mana is<br/>
&gt; wasted healing them, so I usually ask the bard to drop chant of battle<br/>
&gt; and sing mana instead (or one of the psalms for the damage shield),<br/>
&gt; which seems to make it just a tiny bit easier for the tanking classes<br/>
&gt; to keep it from turning on the bards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my time in lower guk I usually found that this wasn&#39;t the case after<br/>
the cleric cast the first big heal on someone. At that point they seemed<br/>
to move to the the top of the the unattached mobs hate list and stay<br/>
there no matter what I tried to do. The only people that seemed to be<br/>
able to get mobs off the cleric in groups I was in were Warriors with<br/>
good taunting technique, and rogues, with backstab.<br/>
