<div id="ygrps-yiv-751198121">I had a wonderful run several weeks ago camping the Sol A King Room with two<br/>
other Bards.  All three of us needed both items and we made a pact early<br/>
Sunday afternoon to stay until all of us got both items.  Both the Champ and<br/>
the Mage spawn there.  I and one other bard there was 32 - the other 30 or<br/>
31.  We pretty much always had a cleric and a druid - and the sixth spot was<br/>
turned over a good amount we always filled it with a finger-wiggler of one<br/>
sort or the other<br/>
<br/>
It took us just over 8 hours to get all six items.  The Champs spawned<br/>
pretty regularly and getting the 3 Vambraces wasn&#39;t too bad.  We ended up<br/>
with a few extras.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it&#39;s the goofy Random Number Generator or not; but while we saw<br/>
a goodly number of Mages it took the 8+ hours to get 3 boots.  The first one<br/>
came before the 3rd Vambrace; like two hours into the run.  Then not a<br/>
single boot for the good 6 hours.  Then two back-to-back...<br/>
<br/>
The King drops a ring common (didn&#39;t get one) and the Fiery Scepter (Mace<br/>
that gives Fire Resist) which I got; don&#39;t use it - need to sell it one of<br/>
these days.<br/>
<br/>
At Level 27 - the room may be tough for you - but I do think if you can get<br/>
a good well rounded group a few levels above you - particularly with an<br/>
Enchanter for crowd control - you should do well.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a quickie, since I&#39;ve spent all my remaining cash on buying some<br/>
&gt; Lambent armour (even though I think I got a really fantastic deal<br/>
&gt; hehe) I&#39;m looking to finish off the set so I can at least say I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; completed it!<br/>
