<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581516556">On that I guess I don&#39;t mind either, but the ones I&#39;ve grouped with have<br/>
basically told everyone in the group exactly what to do and reminded them<br/>
that if they didn&#39;t do exactly as specified and the enchanter died they were<br/>
leaving the group.  The one I usually group with isn&#39;t quite that bad, and<br/>
the one gnome was very friendly, but otherwise they seemed to have the<br/>
attitude that the rest of us were just fancy but unruly pets.  Needless to<br/>
say I avoid those people now.<br/>

Given an enchanter&#39;s limited ac and hp, I don&#39;t think I blame them one bit<br/>
for being &quot;bossy&quot; in regards to mezzed mobs. *shrug*<br/>
