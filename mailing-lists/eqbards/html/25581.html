<div id="ygrps-yiv-468371391">unrest is a vey nice place to level in the low 10ths, go there to kill death<br/>
beetles. its safe if you know what youre doing. go inside and hug left wall<br/>
until you reach a corner in the backyard, its near a tree. this is a safe<br/>
spot and no trains pass through normally. good luck!<br/>
<br/>
also very nice to solo are the bandit camps in lesser fay, you can single<br/>
pull with lull and fight them down easily. also good loot there (bronze<br/>
weaps for some cash).<br/>
<br/>
later on hit lake of ill omen, great xp.<br/>

A level 11 bard asks for some hunting advice, and all you guys (except <br/>
Talies) can do is talk about SoL and 60+ bard stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I haven&#39;t chimed in for a while, but I&#39;ve been busy playing a druid <br/>
on the Firiona Vie (roleplay) server. So since I&#39;ve had to play a character <br/>
from scratch with no twinked equipment, I&#39;ll be happy to give some advice.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to stick to the Qeynos area, then I recommend a few places. <br/>
Blackburrow is a good place to learn about grouping in a dungeon as well as <br/>
about trains. Everfrost (which is beyond Blackburrow) is a good place as <br/>
well, if you go out towards the tundra and group with a ranger. West Karana <br/>
is better hunting for you at your level (various lions and bears) I would <br/>
think North Karana would be very challenging and it&#39;s far away from the <br/>
city, but if you&#39;re having fun there, more power to you. When you&#39;re high <br/>
enough, hunting the rabid wolves in Qeynos Hills (or if with a friend, go <br/>
for rabid grizzlies even better!) and turning in their pelts is decent exp <br/>
and good faction.<br/>
<br/>
I actually prefered to hunt orcs in West Commons by Freeport. Of course, in <br/>
Firiona Vie server, there&#39;s no auction spam. Northern Ro is also an <br/>
excellent place to hunt. I actually think this is my best recommendation, <br/>
as when you&#39;re done in Northern Ro, you can head to Oasis and hunt crocs.<br/>
