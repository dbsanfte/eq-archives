<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424860317">Last night whilst in Oasis (South Ro zone) me and my level 31 friend were<br/>
trying to pull Spectres (failing because 2+ always came), we was the only<br/>
people at this zone other than a 45 enchanter who was killing SG&#39;s, then a<br/>
Young Ranger came running to the zone with a DW Goblins Pet, which he<br/>
killed and as I saw the pet I immediately thought about the DW Goblin<br/>
coming to help it. And there it was, a greenie blue thing from over the<br/>
dune, I ran in and it hit me hard, lost a bubble of health almost<br/>
immediately, but then my mage friend cast Malice and I could Fear/Chain it<br/>
whilst he blasted and his pet kicked it in, along with the help from me and<br/>
a few staff procs, we took it down with very little health loss (me 2 bubbs<br/>
and my friedn 1 bub). I looted and oh yes 1 Opalline helm. Now all I need<br/>
is the Mudwater rune however I don&#39;t really like cazic.<br/>
<br/>
Overall last night was bad for me, I died twice (once in Lower Guk - mino<br/>
trained on me) and (2 SG&#39;s killed me almost instantly at the S Ro zone) and<br/>
ended up at a 1/2 bubble loss. I&#39;m now KOS to froggies so that sucks, I now<br/>
have to invis when going through upper guk &lt;sighs&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
After 2 weeks I&#39;ve come very close to obtaining my fulll suit of Lambent,<br/>
only 1 bracer and the helm to go, I have the DB Bracelet and Opalline helm<br/>
now, I just need some money for gems and the last 2 items. I doubt I will<br/>
wear my Lambent Helm and Bracers though, the stats on my SSB and +5 Dex +3<br/>
Str bracers are nicer. I just want the helm and bracers for when I am<br/>
charming stuff and for general roleplay to look good eg. weddings etc.<br/>
