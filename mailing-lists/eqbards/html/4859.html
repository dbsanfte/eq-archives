<div id="ygrps-yiv-394137514">Z-axis &quot;bug&quot; is in fact a required design flaw to prevent casters from<br/>
easily whomping tanks.  Picture this, if you will: BigBlaster the caster<br/>
levitates high over the head of Lockjaw.  Lockjaw, being melee-only, can do<br/>
nothing but whine and complain, while BigBlaster laughs at him and pummels<br/>
him repeatedly from the safety of his levitation.  With this Z-axis bug,<br/>
melee-only critters can now hit levitators.  So, instead of taking out the<br/>
one spell that caused the problem, they added 27 other new problems in it&#39;s<br/>
place.<br/>
