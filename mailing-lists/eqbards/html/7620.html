<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417948555">Heh no offense but all classes can melee early on. Neither of the priest<br/>
classes can come close to dealing out the damage of SK&#39;s, Paladin&#39;s,<br/>
Rangers, and yes even a bard. They all outdamage all those classes. Even<br/>
early on the hybrid classes deemed by verant can outdamage any of the priest<br/>
classes in melee. Even at high levels what do most priest classes use?<br/>
Observer Staff. But guess what so do the pure casting classes except for<br/>
Necros. Priest classes can not melee that well they are the healers of the<br/>
game, pure and simple.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; by definition you can not classify shaman, cleric,<br/>
&gt;&gt; or druid as hybrids.  this is not an opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re incorrect. That *is* an opinion.. And it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;one that some people on this list share with you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; SHD, RNG, PAL are hybrids.  the priests are not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why aren&#39;t they? They aren&#39;t pure caster classes and<br/>
&gt;they are not pure fighting classes - they do both and<br/>
&gt;do both fairly well. What is a priest ability? There<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t one. There&#39;s not &quot;casters, fighters and priests&quot;.<br/>
&gt;There are &quot;casters&quot; and there are &quot;fighters&quot; and there<br/>
&gt;are a mix of the two.<br/>
