<div id="ygrps-yiv-713574241">The Anthem is much better, since it increases your attack speed.  The<br/>
effect is subtle, but it is definately there, believe me.  It also<br/>
stacks with Jonthan&#39;s Warsong, so your attack speed is VERY much sped<br/>
up, and your strength increases by a huge amount.  I play these two<br/>
songs when soloing even now at level 17.  (And even higher with my high<br/>
level bard in Beta).<br/>

&gt; Just got anthem de arms, and really wondering whether the ol&#39; chant might be<br/>
&gt; better for a group (since I notice both can&#39;t be juggled).  I suppose Anthem<br/>
&gt; de arms is better, rather have 10 strength over some dex and strength?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll use the chant and whistle when alone, and anthem with groups.  Is<br/>
&gt; that what others do?<br/>
