<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-108672733">After reading John Kim&#39;s article on the DOTs and their<br/>
effectiveness, I decided to try them out in a dungeon environment.  I<br/>
memmed CoFl, FCC, Healing, Snare, Invis, Charm, Mez, and Lull and<br/>
wandered into lower guk.  It was pretty heavily camped, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
really run into anything for awhile, but the mino elder room was uncamped.<br/>
There are 4 mino spawns in fairly close proxmity, and a room with 3 wan<br/>
level frogs between that and the undead side.<br/>
	Using Lull, I managed to pull single mino&#39;s and frogs off to one<br/>
side and killed them with CoFl + FCC (Selo&#39;s Drum).  The only time I got<br/>
below 2 bubbles was one wan I pulled that I knew had alacrity, but forgot<br/>
until just after I pulled it.  That one got me down to a sliver, but I did<br/>
manage to kill it.  Keep in mind I was only twisting two songs (plus snare<br/>
when it got under half) and could have easily improved my effeciency if I<br/>
had Discord, Bellow, or any other damage song memmed (mez wasn&#39;t really<br/>
necessary).  If I did happen to pull 2, charm + my dots was enough to<br/>
handle it, so even minor mistakes weren&#39;t a huge issue either.<br/>
	I was level 42 doing this, and except for a polished mithril<br/>
torque for the neck piece, my equipment is fairly normal.  Full lambent,<br/>
obsidian beed hoops for the earring (although opalline or diamondines<br/>
would have been preferred), froglock crown.<br/>
	I think that if I had been more worried about effeciency, I<br/>
could&#39;ve done that area just as easily with only a mm battledrum.<br/>
