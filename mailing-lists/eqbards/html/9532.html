<div id="ygrps-yiv-301447089">No, but if I knew before hand when it was damaged and it was that hard to<br/>
get I&#39;d sure make certain I got it repaired before I used it again.  also if<br/>
things broke occasionally or took money out of the economy to prevent their<br/>
breaking it would not be necessary for it to be a 2 hour camp to get one.<br/>
You&#39;d just have to be sure you took care of it unless you wanted to run all<br/>
the way to Perma to get another one.<br/>

&gt; I would love to see it though.  What about allowing a MOB who kills you,<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; loot one item from your inventory (and then it&#39;s gone forever)?  Actually,<br/>
&gt; that might be way too drastic (I&#39;ve already died 8 times this level :p )<br/>
<br/>
Ya I bet you&#39;d really love having to replace something like a silvery<br/>
war axe for 300 plat or a 2 hour camp.<br/>
