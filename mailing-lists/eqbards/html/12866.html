word for it.  But since both work together, more is better.<br/>
<br/>
Remember there are always more things you can do when you don&#39;t have to do<br/>
crowd control.  I love grouping with [good] enchanters cuz I can just<br/>
assist the tank and let them deal with extra spawns.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When all else fails, buff.  A good motto to live by.  Enchanters (good<br/>
ones) I group with cast augmentation with me around, lasts longer and<br/>
saves mana and with my anthem/celerity/mcvaxius/verses adds up to plenty.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since so many of our songs are AoE,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a post not too long ago running through all our songs and their<br/>
uses.  Never do I not have something else to sing, 8 slots is far too few.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t used invis for the group in forever, last time was Mistmoore in<br/>
like mid20s.  Invis isn&#39;t worth keeping mem&#39;d, it&#39;s use is limited to<br/>
personal movement through live side lower guk, getting to the solA bug<br/>
zone, etc.  If a pet is present, give warning that the pet is going to die<br/>
to prevent your group from being trained on (forcing you to zone, causing<br/>
pet to die).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>
&gt; jackasses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Situational, to be sure.  Sometimes you can&#39;t win a roll for the life of<br/>
you.  I give orders constantly when groups aren&#39;t performing efficiently.<br/>
Last night was a great example of a bad group: warrior rogue me cleric<br/>
wizard enchanter.  Warrior I&#39;ve been with before, great guy.  Rogue is in<br/>
my guild.  Other three stank.  Wiz would sometimes do ok, but more often<br/>
would start casting when the mob was running, which sure gives them the<br/>
finishing blow at the cost of a rather large amount of mana better used<br/>
earlier in the fight.  Enchanter at first wasn&#39;t doing crowd control, then<br/>
started using mesmerize for it (instead of enthrall).<br/>
<br/>
The exasperation set in when the rogue asked three times for buffs and<br/>
received nothing.  I finally had to msg the cleric and ask him to buff the<br/>
rogue (giving the buffs by name, mind).  The enchanter never once cast<br/>
augmentation, alacrity or celerity, and his slowdown spells were so<br/>
sporatic as to be an afterthought.  Of course, he was quite quick about<br/>
turning himself into a werewolf when THAT enchantment wore off.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, there are always people at any level that don&#39;t know how to<br/>
utilize their class&#39; specializations.  Bards that bellow, shamans that<br/>
melee, enchanters that nuke, all you can do is remember names and avoid<br/>
grouping whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>
&gt; successfully and work with each other rather against?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 20, I would have mem&#39;d:<br/>
<br/>
Anthem<br/>
Hymn<br/>
Lullaby if no [good] enchanter<br/>
Largo&#39;s<br/>
Selo&#39;s if outdoors<br/>
Lament if puller<br/>
Invis if Unrest/Mistmoore<br/>
Elemental and Guardian if fighting casters<br/>
Chords/Denons for use in 1 mob situations (and when group is full health,<br/>
use denon&#39;s for practicing brass btwn pulls)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always bellow in a pinch.<br/>
