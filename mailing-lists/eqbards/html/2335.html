<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547943066">A fun use for this song is to get down off of tall objects.  I have been <br/>
spending a lot of time at the Aviak treehouse in South Karana latley. At the <br/>
top of the tower, around the back is a merchant. Whenever I would go up yo <br/>
sell I would use Melifluous Motion to get down. Much quicker then walking :)<br/>

&gt;We finally found a use for the seemingly-useless Melifluous Motion song!<br/>
&gt;  We were prowling around in Solusek&#39;s Eye, and one of the party members <br/>
&gt;got<br/>
&gt;stuck between an urn and the wall, unable to move.  We tried levitating him<br/>
&gt;out; it didn&#39;t help.  While waiting for a GM to respond to the petition,<br/>
&gt;and discussing whether we should just group-teleport out and come back,<br/>
&gt;someone thought of the Melifluous Motion song.  The group wizard cast<br/>
&gt;levitate on me and the stuck player (since this urn was next to a deep pit<br/>
&gt;full of lava), we ungrouped and I grouped with just the stuck player, and I<br/>
&gt;sang a verse of the Motion song. Blink, and we&#39;re both elsewhere in the<br/>
&gt;room.  Unstuck!<br/>
