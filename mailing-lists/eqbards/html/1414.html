<div id="ygrps-yiv-40844581">Take it a step further and Hot Key your assist command.  Then you just target<br/>
the primary tank in your party and hit your hotkey and you will automatically<br/>
target and attack whatever they are fighting.  OR, since we bards tend to do<br/>
most of the fetching, you convince your party members to create a hotkey and<br/>
have you targeted when you leave to fetch and when you return they hit their<br/>
hotkey and will target whichever monster you selected (helps in crowded dungeons<br/>
and various other situations).<br/>
<br/>
(Hotkeys are created by right-clicking on any of your social buttons and then<br/>
editing it to contain a title and command or text or both.  Hotkeys can probably<br/>
only be created from the main interface [small window] screen.)<br/>
