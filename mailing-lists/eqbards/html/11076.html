<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574896004"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m not really sure this is possible if you&#39;re alone.  If you<br/>
&gt;wade into a 5+ mob camp with your AOE songs going, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;notice only 4 of them will attack you at a time.  The rest<br/>
&gt;will stay where they are and ignore you until one of the mobs<br/>
&gt;attacking you dies.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I suppose it could be that if they&#39;re all chasing you, then<br/>
&gt;none of them are attacking you, so all of them can chase<br/>
&gt;you.  I&#39;ll have to try that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh, is this a lizzie only thing?  I&#39;m coulda sworn the entire camp was on<br/>
me last nite when I AoE&#39;d the N Karana raiders and there are seven of them.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t this mean if could beat four of a given thing with Hymn keeping up,<br/>
you could beat almost unlimited numbers because only 4 would attack at once?<br/>
<br/>
I know for certain I have had 12 lions, 6 bears, 2 ghouls, 3 skeletons, and<br/>
5 dervs all chasing me around W Commons when I was level 9 because the guys<br/>
at the druid ring counted as I ran screamin&#39; past.<br/>
