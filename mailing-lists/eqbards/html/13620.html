&gt; &gt; &gt; Now for 30ish people you have a variety of outdoor zones, for dungeons you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A, Guk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; No I don&#39;t since CT,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; fanatics, zealots, a couple other lizards, good until 40. go deeper<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frogs down by the various entrances to lower, good to 35, some to 40.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>UGuk is a lot bigger than most people think.  There are vast<br/>
areas full of shin warriors and knights most of which will<br/>
give experience up to about 40.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also deeper in Sol A is good exp at 40-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of the clockworks (if you&#39;re not against killing them :)<br/>
were still blue to me at 43 or 44..<br/>
<br/>
There is a ton of stuff out there in the L20-40 range that<br/>
most people don&#39;t fight, either out of ignorance or fear.  If<br/>
I knew then what I know now, I would&#39;ve been making about half<br/>
a level per night.  Heck, I took what I learned about<br/>
Mistmoore, set up my L30-40 friends inside the castle, and<br/>
they were making 3-4 bubbles a night.<br/>
