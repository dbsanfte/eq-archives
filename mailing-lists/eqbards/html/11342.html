&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it<br/>
&gt; is stuck in a wall. Or fallen through the world. Or lost<br/>
&gt; due to a verifiable bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it<br/>
&gt; back. (Hope you made friends)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The area where the incident happened in Sol A is indeed<br/>
unrecoverable unless you are a bard or necro, or can trust one<br/>
to loot for you.  The only way in is down a &quot;lavafall&quot; which<br/>
is high enough that you can&#39;t go back up.  The only way out is<br/>
by gating or zoning to Sol B.  Once you get in there with<br/>
levitate, there is no reachable land so you cannot drag your<br/>
corpse up to the surface.  Since your corpse is in the lava,<br/>
you cannot target it to loot it unless you have a song/spell<br/>
to target the nearest corpse for you.<br/>
<br/>
So if you aren&#39;t a bard/necro, the correct course of action<br/>
would indeed be to get a GM or guide to retrieve the corpse<br/>
for you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>
your corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>
the original poster was griping about.<br/>
<br/>
Unless I&#39;m remembering wrong and the /corpse command targets<br/>
the corpse for you...<br/>
