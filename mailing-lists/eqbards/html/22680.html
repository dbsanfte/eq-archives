<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841733360">It is 20 sung, 40-45 string.  As Kaearia points out later in the thread,<br/>
the original poster is mistaken because he/she didn&#39;t account for PVP<br/>
modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
The fatal flaw (in my opinion) inherent to all these rune-style songs is<br/>
that even if you recast this song as fast as you can (not twisting<br/>
anything else), an unslowed mob is going to hit your tank several times<br/>
before the next pulse of the song, and the rune is only absorbing a small<br/>
portion of the damage from the first hit alone.  And it only gets less<br/>
efficient if you are twisting another song or two with it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the song is better than an empty slot in the book I guess, but I<br/>
won&#39;t be playing it much.  *shrug*<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;m wondering if the spell data we get for this is different<br/>
&gt; than what the server is using.<br/>

&gt; &gt; it seems 20 is sung, 45 is max with instrument.  and no hymn does not<br/>
