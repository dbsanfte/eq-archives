<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137162044">The &quot;exploit&quot; isn&#39;t fear kiting.  The mob runs in place (against a wall or<br/>
mountain) - doesn&#39;t turn around -doesn&#39;t fight back.<br/>
<br/>
Fear kiting is not risk free - when fear breaks - the mob will turn around<br/>
and fight you.  Fear and snare either require mana - (or in our case have<br/>
limited duration) and can be resisted.<br/>

Ok, this is only a guess, but I&#39;ll hazard it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It could be, since the mob is running against the wall, it is not out where<br/>
you could potentially aggro something else, where in the open, if a mob runs<br/>
in a straight line, it could come within range of another, effectively<br/>
eliminating the danger designed into the chains (and other snares).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you kept it rooted, once it was against the wall.. ?  Then at<br/>
least you could say it wasn&#39;t going anywhere, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
These are just guesses.  Personally, anything that makes a mob too safe,<br/>
makes the game too boring.  :)<br/>

There are numerous locations in the game where, due to pathing AI, fear<br/>
kiting is a completely safe tactic.  A good example is by the giant fort in<br/>
Burning Woods.  If you pull a giant to either side of the ramp, snare it and<br/>
then start fearing it, it will just run back and forth while everyone whoops<br/>
up on it.  Now if fear breaks then the giant will of course start attacking<br/>
you.  I have never fear kited in the Overthere location referenced earlier<br/>
but if the mob still attacks you when fear breaks or is resisted, then why<br/>
would using fear kiting in this location be considered an exploit when it<br/>
isn&#39;t in other locations?<br/>

In reference to the fear kite tacticts in OT near the skyfire zone -- move<br/>
to the corner between skyfire and frontier mountains.  If you fear mobs<br/>
there, they run up into the corner and run back and forth mostly up in the<br/>
corner.<br/>
<br/>
I had a gm watch me for about 15 minutes up there one evening.  I asked him<br/>
if he considered it an exploit, and he said &quot;Nope, Great tactics!&quot;  Bear in<br/>
mind that the mob was never just running into a wall, it was always in<br/>
motion, and as long as fear wasnt resisted it stayed on this little path<br/>
where it ran back and forth.<br/>
