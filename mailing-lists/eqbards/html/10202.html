<div id="ygrps-yiv-508706032">Well I have no clue about the enchanter clarity stacking with bard&#39;s but I<br/>
do know bard&#39;s clarity stack with each other. My main char is a necro and I<br/>
was grouped with 3 bards in Sol B doing kobolds andthe impact on my mana<br/>
regen was astonishing. I didn&#39;t even have to meditate and we were pulling<br/>
just about non stop. So yes bards clarity does stack.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being a newly 32nd bard I&#39;m getting hit with various questions and claims<br/>
&gt;regarding my 32nd level Clarity song.  I have read previously on this list<br/>
&gt;that our song does stack with an Enchanter&#39;s Clarity spell.  Does anyone<br/>
&gt;have hard number with what percentage increase there is?  Is it in fact<br/>
&gt;Enchanter Clarity + Bard Clarity?  The one thing that I&#39;ve been told that I<br/>
&gt;had no previous knowledge of is that Bard Clarity stacks with Bard Clarity.<br/>
&gt;Is this so?  If so, is it Bard Clarity + Bard Clarity, or a lesser<br/>
&gt;percentage of increase.  What about three or more bards in a group, etc.?<br/>
