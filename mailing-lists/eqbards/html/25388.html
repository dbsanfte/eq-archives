<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137527803">Ack, I&#39;m sorry if I sound belligerent (to anyone), I just get worked up<br/>
discussing this subject.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed talking to you Talani,<br/>
didn&#39;t mean anything personally.  Besides, this list is dead at least we<br/>
are talking.<br/>
<br/>
We had only 1 shaman for a long time, but he is insane.  If we had 6 he<br/>
would not know what to do.  They have 2 now, to ease his pain somewhat.<br/>
I was not bored with my bard, if you are referring to me.  I was not<br/>
bored with the game, I was going through a strange time in my life, I<br/>
quit because of RL not the game.  I was only 59, so I still had a long<br/>
bit of exp&#39;ing to do, which is when bards are useful and fun.  If I<br/>
could go back, I would have left for those 10 weeks and not deleted, but<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I would ever play again, and deleting was a way to ensure<br/>
that (guess it didn&#39;t work).  I play for fun and casually now, I do not<br/>
want 60 nor be in AL again, I can not and do not want to raid 6 nights a<br/>
week for 7 hours a night.  I can raid for less, the only quais-mandatory<br/>
raids (you can&#39;t really force someone to come eh?) are the 2 nights of<br/>
clearing North ToV, but then I would be where I left, the bottom of the<br/>
totem pole, which is not a good thing to be in AL.  It&#39;s not for casual<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
At the time I quit there were 4 bards in the guild: me, Thott, Jaco,<br/>
Syren all 60 but me hehe.  As of a week ago, there was 1 bard, Thott.  I<br/>
quit, Syren moved and had no ISP for 4 months, and Jaco quit because he<br/>
was tired of being in the buff group.  So for 4 months AL had 1 bard<br/>
(Syren just came back this week).  If bards were as needed as many<br/>
think, would AL of all guilds only have 1 bard for 4 months and have<br/>
accomplished what they have?<br/>

Well I can see your points Shada, but I have to also say that I still do<br/>
believe Bards are useful on raids.  People say shaman are useful on<br/>
raids..<br/>
sure, 3 shaman are, but 6?  If there are 6 shaman on our raids I just<br/>
sit<br/>
there and play Diablo on my other comp. (Hope nobody from my guild is<br/>
reading this!)  And again, I haven&#39;t played a bard on 40+ person raids.<br/>
I<br/>
do know that our main Necro switched to the bard character of someone<br/>
who<br/>
had left the game (Iridis), and he is constantly amazed at how much more<br/>
useful bards are than necros in group raids.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
Maybe its that we all just get bored after a while?<br/>
