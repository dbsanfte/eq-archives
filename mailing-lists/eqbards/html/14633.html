<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976297738"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; things I expected to do when I got to 50.  Lets assume after the expansion<br/>
&gt; (with a level cap of 60) that it now takes a 55+ person to go on a<br/>
&gt; dragon/plane raid.  If I understand what your saying, then I should just<br/>
&gt; remain patient until I get to 55th level and then go on raids then (12<br/>
&gt; months from now versus 6 months from now).  If this is the case, then sorry<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t agree with you.  If it takes me 6 months to get to 50 and go on<br/>
&gt; a dragon raid, then I can accept that and be patient.  But if the rules get<br/>
&gt; changed and I now have to wait 12 months before I can go on a dragon raid,<br/>
&gt; then I won&#39;t accept that.  I&#39;ll either retire my bard and play a different<br/>
&gt; class or quit the game entirely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t think they are going to up the levels of the planes, and as<br/>
  far as upping the levels of the dragons, yeah they may up the numeric<br/>
  level (to prevent them from conning anything but red) but I doubt they<br/>
  will significantly improve the stats to where you will be excluded<br/>
  when you make L50 (in 6 months).  Remember npc level means nothing <br/>
  about it&#39;s stats.  The level just determines some of the spell based<br/>
  effectiveness and what skills the npc receives.  Verant independantly<br/>
  of level sets attack values and hitpoint values.  I would hope a L50<br/>
  bard would be desired in the future at a dragon raid, even if people<br/>
  were L60.  I don&#39;t think you are going to be left out.<br/>
