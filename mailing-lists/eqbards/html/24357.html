<br/>
I remember the first time I went there. The 3 or 4 of us were 50 and 51<br/>
(Kunark just out) and we did ok as long as we worked slowly.  But at one<br/>
point, we got a few too many of them angry and we had to evac.  I notice<br/>
that you are 36 and possibly some others in your raid were similar levels.<br/>
This could be why you had some difficulty.  The social range of mobs is<br/>
directly linked to player levels.  Even so, the social range in that dungeon<br/>
and that spot is some thing to contend with.  I used lament to try to reduce<br/>
the social ranges on all my pulls so that we could fight as few as possible.<br/>
And finally, there are a series of &quot;names&quot; in the library (3 or 4) and<br/>
&quot;nearly three hours&quot; might not be long enough to cycle through all of them.<br/>
Also, you may not have seen him on tracking if other mobs had filled your<br/>
list and there was no room for him - sometimes I see mobs on my screen that<br/>
are not on my tracking list.  The tambourine is a fine item and worth going<br/>
back for another attempt - good luck!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Kaesora help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; I am looking for my last coin to the Nostrolo Tamborine quest and it&#39;s in<br/>
Kaesora.  Had a guild raid down there last night that ended in tragedy.  We<br/>
were constantly overwhelmed by mobs down there -- most of the night we had<br/>
10 players in the courtyard.  Many deaths -- had a 50th lvl paladin pulling<br/>
but that didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>
&gt; Worst of all, in nearly three hours of camping the library I never did see<br/>
a failed crypt raider on track.  Please give me some advice for the next<br/>
sortee.<br/>
