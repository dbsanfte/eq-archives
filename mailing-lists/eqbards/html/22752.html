<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Mask <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016848081">I&#39;ve spent way too much time trying to get that dumb mask!  <br/>
<br/>
One try, 11 hours in the room, 2 Assasin spawns.  First one, he dropped the<br/>
mask, but there was already a bard in there, so he was first.  Next spawn,<br/>
over 4 hours later, he drops the other loot, some dumb dagger or other, I<br/>
think...heh.  Almost 4 hours later, it&#39;s a new group in the room, and they<br/>
lose it.  I die, bound in Freeport.  On the run back, I get a tell, the mask<br/>
is there, do I want it?  Of course I do!  I zone into Lguk, ask them to come<br/>
get me.  It poofed, they said.  :/<br/>
<br/>
Couple other tries, totalling a few more hours, ended with me either getting<br/>
run over by trains, or venturing just a *little* too far from the zone<br/>
line...heh.<br/>
<br/>
At level 30, I&#39;m going back, hopefully I&#39;ll be able to find a group and get<br/>
it.<br/>

You go!  I think I&#39;m heading there fairly shortly, but I think I&#39;m gonna ask<br/>
some of my big brothers in the guild if they want to help &quot;lil&#39; me.&quot;  Being<br/>
the only real life girl in a guild composed of all my old gameing buddies<br/>
helps a lot sometimes though. :-)  Being a cute little red haired wood elf<br/>
helps too, I think.<br/>
