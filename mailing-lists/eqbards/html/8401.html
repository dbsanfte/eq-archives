<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809397058">Ok, I KNOW we have gone over this before and there is no such thing, but<br/>
believe it or not I actaully got in an argument on EQrogues over it (go<br/>
figure) so can someone CONFIRM that to all of our vast knowledge, there<br/>
is no such thing?<br/>

Someone on EQrogues is asserting that there is a sword which acts as a<br/>
stringed instrument.<br/>
