<div id="ygrps-yiv-576775590">No, area songs do not effect my party, only anyone within range in my PvP level. (only effects people I could actually attack) Sleep I am told by friends who let me guinea pig them, says it works like a quick stun, they can&#39;t do anything for a second.  I have not really been pked but have heard from people that bards are one of the hardest to kill, we have selo&#39;s of course which breaks root, and also Screech sends them running like mad in the other direction &lt; g &gt; I am sure there are other tips that would be helpful but since I havent really had the need to experiment I&#39;m not sure what all would work the best.<br/>
