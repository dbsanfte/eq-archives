<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478756805">Remember that corpse situation in Lava.  Well, same thing happened to a<br/>
friend of mine.  We were in Paw getting some snakeskin gloves for me, I was<br/>
only 15th at the time and he was 22nd.  Well, we got the gloves and were<br/>
headed out when my buddy got caught in one of the gates.  The only gnolls<br/>
around were too green to bother me so I waited around for him while he<br/>
/petitioned.  After about 30 minutes a GM appeared to talk to us.  The GM<br/>
told my friend, who has since quit unfortunately over this and other<br/>
customer service issues, that he could not help him because at 22nd level he<br/>
should have a spell that would get him out of the situation, Mel&#39;s Motion.<br/>
My friend told the GM he didn&#39;t have the spell as he had never bought it,<br/>
but the GM said since there was no way he could verify that he couldn&#39;t help<br/>
him.  We both thought it was ridiculous at the time and I still do.  We<br/>
ended up getting him out but it was an involved affair.<br/>

Well, last night we took a little trip in to the Lair of Infected Paw (hey,<br/>
you old beta guys, how come so many zones have 2 names? SplitPaw/Infected<br/>
Paw; Lower Guk/Ruin of Old Guk; Beholder/Gorge of King Xorrb; others?<br/>
Didn&#39;t the terrain art guys talk to the monster AI guys?) Anyhow it was<br/>
pretty much fun!<br/>
<br/>
First, I like dungeons that I know the geography pretty well and I have been<br/>
getting killed in Paw since a very young age and done many a CR - even<br/>
before self-invis.  Trains - man that place can train.  We zoned in to be<br/>
greeted by a mega train.  We were 2 groups of 5 & 6. And another group had<br/>
just fled for the zone.  There were at least 20 gnolls - it was the kinda<br/>
scene where you go &quot;zone zone - its not worth it&quot; but stay cuz you are<br/>
fascinated by the sheer number of gnolls.  <br/>
<br/>
So our tanks and casters started fighting them and our enchanters started AE<br/>
mezzing - at least I sure hope they were AE mezzing.  But everyone was<br/>
fighting a different gnoll and switching gnolls to taunt off the casters.<br/>
In short it was a total mess! So, I figured wtf??? Lets see how these dogs<br/>
like screetch with a horn.  I equipped my brass horn and let fly with some<br/>
truly blood curdling notes - at least the doggies thot so and off they went.<br/>
Start a train?  Hell, this was a mega train already.  But it seemed like a<br/>
good idea and did clear the area out for a while.  They did of course come<br/>
back and it took us a long time to kill them all  - wave after wave after<br/>
wave of gnolls.  But none of us got killed and only 2 had to zone.  Had we<br/>
not been at the dead end by the zone - I certainly would not have used the<br/>
fear song but at that point it was about my only option with the songs I had<br/>
memmed.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, we were trying to clear the first bridge and got another train<br/>
pulled onto us.  This was definitely not the place to be fearing things off<br/>
so I stepped out and memmed in Lullaby.  Our enchanter was either not Ae<br/>
mezzing, our tanks and thos in the melee were not /assisting or there was<br/>
too much gnoll switching going on - whatever - it was kinda last ditch<br/>
effort but I chose Lullaby with the lute and I think I tried pulsing it<br/>
even.  Even with its reduced abilities there were enough nodding gnolls that<br/>
I think it helped.  Hopefully it was interrupting the gnoll casters who were<br/>
healing the gnoll tanks.  On this one we did lose 3 of our lower level<br/>
members (all casters) but we dragged them a bit deeper into the dungeon and<br/>
our cleric rezzed them back (its pretty sweet to have a lev 50 cleric in<br/>
your guild and in your expedition ;).  At least for us baby upper 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So then we decided to take the age-old short cut and we hopped off that<br/>
first bridge for the lower level.  Be carefull and hop onto the ground<br/>
because there are blue (to me at 38) snakes in the water that will aggro on<br/>
you.  We cleared some more gnolls and worked our way to the old shaman&#39;s<br/>
rooms (the 2 rooms at the top of the small staircase.)  Each party took a<br/>
room and mine drew the one with the necro - with a bit of help from the<br/>
others who finished early - we killed these guys too.  Only PH&#39;s - no named<br/>
bosses were up. We sat thru one more spawn and then decided to fight our way<br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
Fighting into a passageway, I tarried too long in a door way and got trapped<br/>
on top of the door when it came down.  Door comes down, Sylly gets on top of<br/>
door, door goes up and Sylly goes up and is stuck inside the terrain.   With<br/>
visions of falling thru the world for 10000 dmg like happened to me in Upper<br/>
Guk - I did not wriggle around too much but sent in a petition.  I thought<br/>
of Melifious motion but did not want to zap the others nor disband at that<br/>
point.  So, they got out and our druid came back or stayed back and we gated<br/>
to NK.  And within 20 mins of getting stuck - more like 15 my petition got<br/>
answered - they do seem to be getting better.  <br/>
<br/>
So all in all - New Paw was quite fun.  It was lots different even though<br/>
most of the old AI is still there.  Healers placed out of immediate area<br/>
healing the tanks you fight, etc. It was fun to have more &quot;grown up&quot; magic<br/>
and somewhat better party manners (good weps, assist the tanks, mez, etc.)<br/>
to fight them.  And trains - - hehe - its still got trains.<br/>
