<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were playing any song at all (even Selos is a buff), then the<br/>
monster put you on his hate list.  If the other group was fighting multiple<br/>
mobs and only dealing damage to one (as they probably should), then the<br/>
other mob could easily be pulled off by your song.  Once the mob jumped<br/>
you, you started playing your songs the best you know how.  Anthem or Heal<br/>
or whatever song you play is not only pulsing on you, but also on every PC<br/>
around you.  While your songs don&#39;t affect PCs not in your group, they<br/>
still put you on the hate list for the mob (and faction adjustments).  If<br/>
you are surrounded by your group and the other group, the mob sees you<br/>
buffing 12 PCs.  Nothing will get the mob off you as long as you keep<br/>
playing your songs like this.<br/>
<br/>
Let me reiterate again, I was playing nothing, nada, zilch, not one blasted<br/>
note.  The entire time I was in the zone I kept my mouth shut because<br/>
everything in there was red to me.  The only reason I was there was to look<br/>
around a little and to auction for some items and to role-play.  I sang<br/>
nothing, fought nothing, did nothing.  It was a dungeon so I couldn&#39;t have<br/>
played Selo&#39;s if my life depended on it, which it would have had a cleric<br/>
not poured mana into me when they could not pull the stupid goblin off me.<br/>
Believe me I fully understand that Buff&#39;s of any kind add you to the hate<br/>
list, bard is not the only class I play.<br/>
<br/>
And there are also other factors that can make you believe in &quot;bard hate&quot;.<br/>
Zones are buggy.  Songs can go through walls, unlimited z-axis, and<br/>
sometimes all the way to the other side of the zone.  And many zones have<br/>
pathing problems.  You may be affecting mobs and not even know it.  Five<br/>
minutes later, the mob may have finally found a way to you.  It will run<br/>
past other people who are not on it&#39;s hate list until it gets to you.  You<br/>
might not have even been playing your songs for several minutes.  Of course<br/>
you will think that it is Bard Hate, but there is no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bard&#39;s song that cause monsters to attack, not just being a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Again I never played a note in Perma, not so much as one tiny sparkle.  I<br/>
did absolutely nothing to entice, antagonize, irritate, or otherwise cause<br/>
myself to be noticed.  The mob just turned from its fight with the party I<br/>
was watching and waltzed over to smack me around.  Fortunately it was<br/>
probably only light red because it was only doing damage in the 30&#39;s to me.<br/>
It was an extra mob in the group they were fighting, but since I did<br/>
absolutely nothing that should not have mattered on iota.<br/>
<br/>
In my first example where the gnoll reavers ran past the puller and the two<br/>
other group members to jump me I was also not singing anything since I was<br/>
in the middle of putting my dirk away and getting out my Screamer to raise<br/>
my 1HB while I had a safe chance to do so.  I had just finished memming my<br/>
group songs so hadn&#39;t even had a chance to start one up yet.  There really<br/>
was zero &quot;normal&quot; reason for the mob&#39;s to act as they did.  This is why I am<br/>
firmly convinced that some &#39;bug&#39; or other unintended &#39;feature&#39; is causing<br/>
bard hate.  I&#39;m quite certain it is not intentional on Verant&#39;s part as it<br/>
makes no sense for there to be such a thing, but they let so many bugs thru<br/>
that are for certain, I am quite ready to believe that there are some that<br/>
are questionable that are still true.<br/>
