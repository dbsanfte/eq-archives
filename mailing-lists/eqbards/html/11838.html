<div id="ygrps-yiv-805417807">Greetings!<br/>
I have tried Kith too and agree with the exp/hour ratio.  The pull is either <br/>
too damaging to the party, meaning downtime during the night, or too easy <br/>
with poor exp.  It seemed during the night we would fight against 2 rotting <br/>
knights and the be wasted for most of the rest.  Then ready to fight and <br/>
it&#39;s morning with nothing but a few easy kills hanging around.  BTW, Rotting <br/>
Knights disappeared when low on exp twice for us too.  Just vanished.  They <br/>
were on tracking but in a wall.  So mind pulling toward Rivervale.  When <br/>
they get low health and run, don&#39;t let em!  I know I know...what about <br/>
chains?  Resisted or bad luck on missed notes.  Just a tidbit of info so you <br/>
don&#39;t have your RK disappear too!<br/>

P.S.  Disagreements are welcome!  Maybe it is a personal thing, but I don&#39;t <br/>
care to hunt in Kith yet (still lvl 35).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve tried Kith about four different times now, and while I&#39;ve been in <br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups, not died, etc., the mob/hour and exp./hour ratio is pretty bad.  <br/>
&gt;You<br/>
&gt; &gt; wait for a pull while playing clarity.  Some Ranger or Druid is out <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt; &gt; running around.  &quot;Inc!&quot; So you stand up, fight one blue/yellow/red mob <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then wait for another pull...  Then 7am rolls around and you *sit* for <br/>
&gt;20<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes real time.  So all-in-all you might kill 5 or 6 mobs during the<br/>
&gt; &gt; night if you&#39;re lucky.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really seen my exp. move<br/>
&gt; &gt; fighting in the new Kith.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmm.  I didn&#39;t see finding mobs as a big problem with<br/>
&gt;Kithicor.  I&#39;m usually able to keep a steady stream of mobs<br/>
&gt;for my groups to fight.  Just run out to fetch a new one<br/>
&gt;before the one you&#39;re fighting is dead.  When it becomes day,<br/>
&gt;let the paladins find undead using their sense undead spell -<br/>
&gt;it points them at the nearest undead (which doesn&#39;t work when<br/>
&gt;a necro or SK pet is nearby).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The problem keeping up your mobs/hour ratio in Kithicor is<br/>
&gt;that the mobs are just way too tough for their level.  The<br/>
&gt;harm touches insure you&#39;re going to have at least a minute or<br/>
&gt;two of downtime after the fight.  Most of the mobs are casters<br/>
&gt;on top of that, and all can debuff or disease you, thus<br/>
&gt;requiring even more downtime.  If a party member gets feared,<br/>
&gt;half the time he&#39;s gonna die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another problem is that it&#39;s an outdoor zone.  There are no<br/>
&gt;structured halls for people to find shelter in, so everyone<br/>
&gt;pulls to the zones.  One group screws up, and everyone on that<br/>
&gt;side has to get out.  The undead are not very particular about<br/>
&gt;who they attack either, so pulling is a problem, as is having<br/>
&gt;other people&#39;s pulls jumping on you in a tough fight.<br/>
