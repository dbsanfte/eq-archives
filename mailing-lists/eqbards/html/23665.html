<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-811256503">I&#39;ve never been to Sebilis and was thinking of making that my main hangout<br/>
for a while once I get to 51st level.  For those of you with a lot of<br/>
experience hunting in that zone, would like your feedback.  Since all of the<br/>
mobs there will be 45+, I assume Pixie Strike will not be that effective.<br/>
Not certain how well Charm will work.  I know once I get to 53 and get SoT<br/>
then crowd control will be a lot easier.  But until then, how effective will<br/>
I be at performing crowd control in Sebilis?  Would it be smarter to hang<br/>
out in Karnors and other zones until I get to 53 and head to Sebilis then?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
