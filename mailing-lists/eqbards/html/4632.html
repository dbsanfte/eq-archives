<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295589764">good point on the elemental resists. Course Crush&#39;s tunic boosts those too<br/>
as does the elemental rhythyms I usually use.  Until they cast a poison or<br/>
disease spell I usually dont use Purifying unless I know the are<br/>
necro-oriented.  Dont the elemental resists start out higher than MR as<br/>
well, 35 as opposed to 25 I seem to remember offhand.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t recall seeing a resistance message ever for a partially resistable<br/>
&gt; spell like Direct Damage (DD) ones.  However, when the caster hits me and<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; health bar doesn&#39;t move from a spell that can do up to 40 points, I know I<br/>
&gt; took at most 3 or 4, I don&#39;t have that many hp&#39;s so the bar movement is<br/>
&gt; still pretty visible.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  I wish they&#39;d change it so you could immediately see how<br/>
much damage you take from a spell.  The caster gets to see how<br/>
much damage he did, why can&#39;t you see how much damage you<br/>
took?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; fail that would have been my choice, and 7 straight walking sleeps.  All<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; all I seldom take any measurable damage from spells, but then again my MR<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; jacked up pretty high for my level.  Since it is unlikely to improve much<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; this point, barring increased song effects, I will undoubtedly have more<br/>
&gt; trouble at higher levels.  113 vs a hag probably isnt anywhere near as<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; as having 70 somethin against lvl 15-17 casters.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m right and most DD spells check your fire<br/>
or cold resist.  You can&#39;t raise those as high since the Psalm<br/>
series does not stack with Elemental or Purifying Rhythms.<br/>
Everything seems to stack with Guardian Rhythms.<br/>
