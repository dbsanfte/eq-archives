<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345423762">Hehe, less than 50%, he says.<br/>
<br/>
I would guess my forage works about 5% to 10% at best.  I&#39;ve got it up in<br/>
the high 30&#39;s (not maxed at 40 yet).<br/>
It seems to take FOREVER to get a skill increase.  I never forage enough to<br/>
keep me fed, I always have to get some food at the shop, so i generally get<br/>
20 bread when I get water.  Also, I seem to get water about 30% of the time<br/>
I do get a success.<br/>
I&#39;m gonna mess with a log parser and see what the actual rates are, if not,<br/>
I&#39;ll try to load my logs up into something to get some more definate<br/>
figures.<br/>
As it is, forage is not enough to even keep me fed, much less keep enough<br/>
water around to drink.<br/>

&gt;Forage is not useful?!!!  Please!  I&#39;ve heard several<br/>
&gt;people complain about this in this thread.  I never<br/>
&gt;have to buy food!  I think that is extremely useful.<br/>
&gt;Granted, once you get to higher levels it isn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt;food is some huge expense.  But it is something you<br/>
&gt;have to remember to buy if you are a class without<br/>
&gt;forage capabilities.  Me?  I just click forage when I<br/>
&gt;remember and there is food.  Heck, it probably works<br/>
&gt;less than 50% of the time but it definitely produces a<br/>
&gt;big enough stream of food to keep my supplies up.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all<br/>
&gt;&gt; these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>
&gt;&gt; skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you<br/>
&gt;&gt; wonder why they bothered? I<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger,<br/>
&gt;&gt; or forage - but I<br/>
&gt;&gt; WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   The other thought i have to add here is that like<br/>
&gt;&gt; tracking<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a<br/>
&gt;&gt; level and it never<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is<br/>
&gt;&gt; the skill we get it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its<br/>
&gt;&gt; at skill lvl 40 when<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill<br/>
&gt;&gt; cap for druids is 200<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;i believe<br/>
