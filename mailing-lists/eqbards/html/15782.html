<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176530280">I know its cheezy, but at 23rd you can do deepwater goblin pets in Lake<br/>
Rathetear near the Rathe Mountains zone.  They run to you, no puller<br/>
required and you can solo them with the all instrument attack.  For me 20-27<br/>
were the worse levels, I felt like I was useless (MM fustration, lack of<br/>
good groups, as has been said the learning curve part, a/k/a dying, sucks)<br/>
because I was reduced to doing the pets.  But I got over it and just<br/>
grounded out 25-27 there, at 27th I hit Cazic (*love* that place, TR is one<br/>
of the best camps peroid), at 32nd I hit upper guk (a vastly untapped pit of<br/>
xp), at 35 the BR to get over hell (did it in 2 night ;), at 37 (did 36th<br/>
the same night) the undead tower and from there on out the live keep and<br/>
usual named undead froggies.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it funny now that I think about it to see the &quot;lguk&quot; people and the<br/>
&quot;solb&quot; people? =)<br/>
