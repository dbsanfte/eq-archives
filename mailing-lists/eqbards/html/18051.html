switch to a distant 3rd person view so I can watch out for wanderers.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] How do you play this game?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing computer games since Pong (yeah, I&#39;m that old).  My <br/>
coordination and reflexes were never that hot (which is why I sucked at <br/>
sports), and they seem to get worse with age.  Plus, I&#39;ve usually played <br/>
turn-based strategy games.  And, in agreement with the &quot;can&#39;t teach an <br/>
old dog new tricks&quot; axiom, I&#39;ve been playing this game in the default <br/>
first-person mode, using the keyboard for everything but targetting MOBs. <br/>
(It took me until level 40 to switch from using the mouse for song <br/>
activation to setting up hot keys, which shows you how stuck in old <br/>
habits I can get.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how the rest of you play.  Do you use the other views, and <br/>
if so, for what purposes?  I&#39;ve been playing with the mid-range <br/>
third-person view for soloing for about a month, but I&#39;m having a lot of <br/>
trouble using it in group situations.  Does this just take practice?  <br/>
Does anyone use the &quot;behind the back&quot; view for any reason other than <br/>
aesthetics?  My avatar constantly gets in the way on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you use your mouse for movement?  Do you actually feel that you <br/>
have better control than with the keyboard, or is this the inverse of my <br/>
situation (e.g., you always used the mouse, so the keyboard seems <br/>
awkward)?<br/>
