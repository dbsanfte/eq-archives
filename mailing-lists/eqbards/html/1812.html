<b>Subject:</b> Idea: Song Scripts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-730539455">Time for a new topic.  One of the most lamentable losses for the Minstrel<br/>
Bard is the lack of an effective way to &quot;sing&quot;.  Many people like to spam<br/>
using socials (as a cheap way to learn languages), but there is truly no<br/>
efficient way to do this with songs.  So, currently, we Minstrels are stuck<br/>
with hand-typing if we want to sing, and it&#39;s just not all that effective.<br/>
<br/>
Proposal:  Create a new command: /script &lt;filename.txt&gt;<br/>
Function: /script allows a textfile to be read directly into the talk<br/>
buffer, with certain commands changing the output.  Textfile maximum size<br/>
of 5k (to prevent gawdawful spam), maximum line length of (?).  Timer<br/>
prevents scripts from being &#39;read&#39; repeatedly (30 sec pause minimum before<br/>
another script can be read).  (30 sec pause between scripts)<br/>
Internal script commands: <br/>
       /pause x  - pauses before sending next line of output<br/>
       ; - marks end of line without sending output.<br/>
       /cr - sends carriage return<br/>
       /sing - alters &quot;XX says&quot; output to &quot;XX sings&quot; output.<br/>
       /emote - alters output to emote-styled output.<br/>
       /! - comment<br/>
Pros:  Allows RP-style singing, recitations, and other large-quantity text<br/>
communications.  This can be utilized by GM&#39;s in quests, as well.  Is only<br/>
local, so will not necessarily be overly spammy (as opposed to OOC and<br/>
Shout abusers).<br/>
<br/>
Cons: Can be easily abused.  /ignore of course will solve this problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Example of a script:<br/>
/! The Scotsman, by Mike Cross (performed by Bryan Bowers)<br/>
The Scotsman, for all you Barbarians out there!<br/>
/cr<br/>
/sing Oh a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evenin&#39; fair, ;<br/>
And one could tell by how he walked he&#39;d drunk more than his share; <br/>
He fumbled round &#39;til he could no longer keep his feet,; <br/>
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street. <br/>
/cr<br/>
/sing     Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh ;<br/>
     Ring di-diddle-aye-oh ;<br/>
     Oh he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street. ;<br/>

HERBERT:  But I don&#39;t want any of that.  I&#39;d rather--<br/>
FATHER:  Rather what?!<br/>
HERBERT:  I&#39;d rather...<br/>
