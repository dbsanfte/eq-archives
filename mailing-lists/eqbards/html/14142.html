&gt;I have not tried to split the Lord room in Lower, although it is quite open <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;would be easy to try.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is very doable. I&#39;ve done it two times now. Put 8 minutes between each <br/>
pull so that there was a nice spread between fights and we pulled all night. <br/>
  I lost all the lottos though. :)<br/>

&gt;mesmerized.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about Lament and the fire giants (we had a monk pulling for us <br/>
the 2 times I did this), but Pixie Strike worked on the fire giants. Tenya <br/>
kept one giant out of the fight while we killed Skarlon. I had always heard <br/>
that mez didn&#39;t work on them too until I saw it.<br/>
