the Rune spells are like a one-shot hp buff, except you don&#39;t<br/>
know how many hp it&#39;s buffed.  If you&#39;re at full health, it&#39;s<br/>
like the hp buff from Daring or Skin like Stone; except once<br/>
you drop below the buff effect, it goes away.  If you&#39;re<br/>
significantly below full health, it&#39;s like a heal that doesn&#39;t<br/>
show up on your hp bar.<br/>
<br/>
What this means is that if you have to decide on one and only<br/>
one buff - a hp buff or heal spell or Rune - the others are<br/>
preferable to the Rune line.  Of course, if you can have<br/>
multiple buffs, then Rune away to your heart&#39;s content.  It&#39;s<br/>
a very handy spell (since it can double as a last-ditch heal -<br/>
something the Skin spells can&#39;t do), but don&#39;t let the<br/>
psychological factor of &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not taking damage!&quot; fool you<br/>
into thinking it&#39;s better than the others.  You *are* taking<br/>
damage, you just can&#39;t see it.<br/>
