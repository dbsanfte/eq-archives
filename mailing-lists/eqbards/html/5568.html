<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325087580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I basically dealt with it by mothballing my L49 bard and<br/>
&gt; starting a druid on the new server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did the same (still play my Bard though) and started a<br/>
cleric (up to 7), wizard (up to 7) and a Shaman (up to 11<br/>
so far). Right now I find myself mostly playing the Shaman<br/>
because being an Ogre is so much fun. Not to mention I&#39;m<br/>
*really* looking forward to levitate at 14 instead of<br/>
waiting for 31 (?) for my Bard to get it. Flying Ogres!<br/>
<br/>
I love my bard quite a bit, but I&#39;m dreading the higher levels<br/>
when I have to give extensive thought as to which songs to play<br/>
in which situation. It just seems like a lot of work instead<br/>
of fun. *shrug* Maybe it&#39;s not and I&#39;ll find out. But I don&#39;t<br/>
forsee myself ever hitting 50. I&#39;d much rather have 8<br/>
different characters of different classes to see what they&#39;re<br/>
all like.</div>
