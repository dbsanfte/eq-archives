&gt; &gt; Look what you did Harm!  Now everyone is a cynic today.  Isn&#39;t there anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; on this list that still thinks Verant did a great job on a great game and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; should feel lucky to be playing it?  Damn SB live bug...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Harm&#39;s just cranky because he promised me he would get me a Lambent Helm, and he had to kill 25 DW goblins<br/>
to get the Opoline helm to make it with.  If I had to crank through 25 DW goblins, I&#39;d be irritated, too.<br/>
Thanks, Harmonic!<br/>
