<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393424322">This is my take on the bard&#39;s role, since this thread is sort of turning<br/>
that way:  I get most of this perspective leading a regular group as<br/>
cleric (or in my football playing friend&#39;s words, I am the quarterback)<br/>
<br/>
Our regular party: Cleric, Wizard, Warrior, Bard.  We sometimes pickup a<br/>
5th or 6th member, since our regular two no longer are around. <br/>
(Generally we try to get a druid/shaman and another tank).  Our bard is<br/>
married thus often leaves Norrath earliest at the end of the night.<br/>
<br/>
When she is there, we can fight high blues/whites, yellows basically non<br/>
stop (both the wiz and I have resigned ourselves to medding over<br/>
meleeing).  If things are going well we get a bubble of xp per hour (not<br/>
counting travel/sell/BS time).  I really get the feeling we are a well<br/>
oiled machine, running down the feeble creatures of Norrath (don;t burst<br/>
my bubble, please).<br/>
<br/>
When the bard leaves I estimate our kill rate is cut is half.  (which<br/>
means around 2/3 xp each, removing the group bonus factor).<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it a lot the last two weeks (our bard thinks she is<br/>
underpowered, and is thinking of making a new character), and I really<br/>
decided a bard&#39;s role is to make every one else in the party better.  As<br/>
simple as that sounds, I think that really defines their role in a<br/>
party.  With the bard around the healing load on me drops drastically. <br/>
(I often don&#39;t heal the wiz all night if the bard is around).  Obviously<br/>
the bard&#39;s melee damage doesn;t compare to the warrior&#39;s (silvery ware<br/>
axe and that brass scimitar for the bard vs dual langseaxs or langseax<br/>
of the wolves for the warrior), but it still adds up.  Also, the bard<br/>
gives a melee character who can finish off runners (where you have some<br/>
space to allow some running), saving the wizard from wasting mana of<br/>
rooting or nuking. <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re outside, bard is probably the best puller in the game. I don;t<br/>
think any other class can SOW, lull, and absorb the initial attacks<br/>
(until the warrior taunts them off).  (any caster should be medding<br/>
while pulling is going on, so don&#39;t even try to suggest a druid, if any<br/>
caster is FOM, then the group is doing something wrong).<br/>
<br/>
The second role of the bard is fill gaps.  Not many people have the<br/>
luxury of having the ideal 6 person party.  Already (lvl 20) our bard<br/>
can make up for our lack of a enchanter, and at 23 she will have to try<br/>
to fill in for our lack of snare. (We grouped with a true newbie druid<br/>
(lvl 18, full patchwork, derv rings, nothing else) this weekend, who<br/>
asked me what he should do, I said &quot;Thorn the warrior first, then snare<br/>
the mobs and I don&#39;t care if you spend the rest of your mana making<br/>
yourself look like a tree&quot;.  I do understand the power of snare).<br/>
<br/>
At least for the first 20 levels, I have no questions about the<br/>
usefulness of bards.  This may change as we level more, but I have no<br/>
doubts about her power till now.  We all think (with little doubt) that<br/>
so far the least important char in our group is the wizard.  She&#39;s a<br/>
great player (remember how I said I never had to cast heals on her? <br/>
Thats a pretty good sign of a good wizard), but I don;t think the group<br/>
really hurts without her.  Obviously fights go slower, but I would say<br/>
our xp gain is about the same with or without her.  Theres a definite<br/>
drop off when any of the other members leave.  I may change my tune at<br/>
29 when she gets teleport.  We&#39;ll see (I don&#39;t really care about her<br/>
personal teleports she just got, she&#39;s pretty excited though).<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this is all just my low level opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea on a totally sperate note, with that Langseax of Wolves, our<br/>
barbarian warrior (all bronze armor except crafted gauntlets and blood<br/>
stained mantle), with only my lvl 19 cleric buffs can solo Broon<br/>
(yel/red to him).  Thats one impressive sword.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
