I have been having the same problem myself. I figured out after sitting for<br/>
about 5 hours in the same spot and playing playstation that I was using an<br/>
&quot;Unfinished&quot; Horn and I was wondering why my skill didnt increase. Any idea<br/>
where we can get the regular horn. I have looked in freeport so far in the<br/>
guild and they dont have it.<br/>

&gt; You want to use a plain ol&#39; horn. And you will miss MANY notes at first. I<br/>
&gt; would suggest going someone far away from people, kicking the song up, and<br/>
&gt; let it sit for a couple hours. That will give you a good start into the<br/>
&gt; skill. And contrary to what some people say, you do not have to have a<br/>
target<br/>
&gt; for the skill to rise.<br/>
&gt; The place I chose for my AFK practice was in Qeynos Hills all the way<br/>
across<br/>
&gt; the zone from the entrance to the karana&#39;s, up on the hill. I didn&#39;t see<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; living thing and even after letting it sit all night I was still alive :)<br/>
&gt; Anyways, good luck to ya.<br/>
