<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191538474">My favourite mobs so far are either some of the ghost things in the City of<br/>
Mist or the Ravenous Nibblers in Dalnir.<br/>
<br/>
My guild dungeon crawled Dalnir earlier today - didn&#39;t find much but its a<br/>
really well designed and great looking place. If you can get a level 35<br/>
group it would be really worth a trip. Sadly it was a little too low level<br/>
for us as we were all level 40+.<br/>
