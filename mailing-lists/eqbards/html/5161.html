&gt; Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions<br/>
&gt; suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central<br/>
&gt; to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do<br/>
&gt; you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unrest is too crowded (and buggy) to do anything but camp at<br/>
the wall and pull).  The most fun I had there is when my group<br/>
insisted on camping the hand room.  I was bored to tears (and<br/>
I think everyone else was too) so I went out onto the balcony<br/>
and started pulling other people&#39;s trains up to us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.  And<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so<br/>
&gt; loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there<br/>
&gt; now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the problem is that it&#39;s so difficult to stick with<br/>
your group since your vision is limited to about 60 degrees<br/>
forward and resolution of distant objects in the horizon is<br/>
poor.  Running with my drum, I&#39;ve lost track of someone in my<br/>
group I was following when one of the sparkles from the song<br/>
overlapped with their position.  By the time the sparkle<br/>
disappeared, I&#39;d lost them.  It would help tremendously if<br/>
everyone were given some rudimentary form of tracking that<br/>
worked on group members only.  The range does not have to be<br/>
huge, but it should be enough for group members to stay<br/>
together while moving outdoors.  The /follow command just does<br/>
not cut it because of packet loss and dead reckoning glitches<br/>
that cause people&#39;s avatars on your screen to run in circles.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I remember Brad McQuaid discussing this, and saying it&#39;s the path of least<br/>
&gt; resistance.  How he and his buddies would group up, and move through<br/>
&gt; permafrost together, eventually reaching some deep section, then heading<br/>
&gt; back to quit for the evening.  This is an ideal, I wish I could be in THAT<br/>
&gt; group, because I have NEVER ever ever ever been in a group like that.  GOD<br/>
&gt; YES I wish that was how Everquest REALLY worked the WAY he said!!!  Seeing<br/>
&gt; such a dungeon, I think he&#39;s bullshitting because it seems impossible!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is just about the only way I play.  I was fortunate to<br/>
find a group of people early on who liked to mostly do this<br/>
(well except for Dervish camps since they don&#39;t move, Oasis<br/>
orcs since the place was crawling with sand giants in my<br/>
youth, and Unrest for the reasons I&#39;ve stated above).  It is a<br/>
lot of fun, but the problem is you *still* never get any of<br/>
the good items.  You will sweep through the dungeon, and all<br/>
the spots where a named mob drops a nice item are camped.  You<br/>
basically just end up making things safer for the campers -<br/>
they essentially hog the cream while you&#39;re left with the<br/>
rest.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So folks camp.  They find the area where things give them experience, sit<br/>
&gt; there for a few hours, and let one person bring the nasties to them.  And<br/>
&gt; the warriors are always healing, and the mages are always meditating anyway.<br/>
&gt; So the game -requires- camping in this respect.  We aren&#39;t choosing the<br/>
&gt; &quot;path of least resistance&quot; because I, for one, do not know what the hell<br/>
&gt; McQuaid is talking about.  I&#39;d love to see him and his group play.  Either<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a classic case of a phenomenon called the tragedy of the<br/>
commons.  People tend to abuse shared resources to a greater<br/>
extent than if they actually owned a piece of it.  That&#39;s why<br/>
people litter in parks but not on their lawns - because one<br/>
piece of litter on a 100 acre park used by 100 people seems<br/>
meaningless even though the situation is the same as owning a<br/>
house on 1 acre. That&#39;s why people overfish - the negative<br/>
consequences for it are amortized over all fishermen, whereas<br/>
the benefits are concentrated on yourself.  This depletes the<br/>
fishery, but instead of trying to conserve it, people&#39;s first<br/>
reactions are to try to &quot;get their share&quot; before &quot;it runs<br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So the optimal way to play the game would be for everyone to<br/>
sweep through dungeons, killing the occasional named mob if<br/>
they see it.  Unfortunately, all it takes is *one* camper to<br/>
disrupt this, which drives everyone else to camp to remain<br/>
competetive, which causes the downard spiral of this game into<br/>
Evercamp.<br/>
<br/>
All this is so obvious to me I don&#39;t know why the folks at<br/>
Verant can&#39;t see it.  Camping is *not* just a different way to<br/>
play the game, it is *harmful* to the game.  I think the folks<br/>
at Verant concentrated too much on graphics, networking, AI,<br/>
and game balance, which was the formula for making single-<br/>
player RPGs.  They should&#39;ve hired at least one sociologist<br/>
for input on the intersocial reactions people would have<br/>
towards each other once locked together in their gameworld.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If McQuaid would like bands of adventurers to be heroically moving about and<br/>
&gt; adventuring, rather than  sitting around like white trash in a JellyStone<br/>
&gt; Park, why is it like this?  O, fighters need time to sit and heal, and mages<br/>
&gt; need time to replenish mana.  The game encourages camping by all it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; downtime.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The game is actually well-tuned for a group sweeping through a<br/>
dungeon.  The spawns are spaced out enough that after a hard<br/>
fight, you can all sit and heal/med in the area you just<br/>
cleared, and still have a few minutes to move on before the<br/>
things you just killed respawn.  This is also why just<br/>
cranking up the spawn rate is not the solution.  Either the<br/>
world needs to be larger, or the servers need to be<br/>
depopulated to around 1000/server.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better,<br/>
&gt; especially one that is so Player vs. Environment based.   This is AI that<br/>
&gt; was seen in Doom, if that.  The wonder of AI that some folks are impressed<br/>
&gt; by how it acts, when it&#39;s actions are not that complex.  MUST be improved.<br/>
&gt; When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the current paradigm most companies seem to be using for<br/>
MMRPGs, AI resources = server resources.  This needs to be<br/>
separated so AI can be processed independently of other server<br/>
functions.  That is the way the DoD networked sims work (which<br/>
is the field I&#39;m currently working in).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll add that when I commented to a UO friend that Verant had<br/>
beefed up Cazic Thule because he was too easy to kill, his<br/>
tongue-in-cheek reply was &quot;What if they drop bales of hay<br/>
around him and shoot him with arrows.&quot;  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Death.  There is no death.  I want to die.  I cannot die.  Who were the<br/>
&gt; generation before this, the immortal generation?  Totally ignored by the<br/>
&gt; story of the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Permanent death makes for a *very* different game.  Moria and<br/>
Rogue/NetHack worked this way.  Of course those games were<br/>
also single-player so there was no need to worry about<br/>
&quot;keeping pace&quot; with your group.  There was literally a &quot;top<br/>
ten&quot; chart of the highest levels players had managed to<br/>
achieve before dying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * The story is too static.  One of Brad McQuaid&#39;s problems with adding<br/>
&gt; monsters that offer random cool items was that it wouldn&#39;t work in the<br/>
&gt; story.  I can understand this point perfectly, yet people would always be<br/>
&gt; camping anyway because that&#39;s all they ever do.  But back to the story.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EQ is a highly structured and highly static game.  IMHO the<br/>
level system pretty much requires that in order to keep the<br/>
player/monster balance steady.  DD (former lead designer of<br/>
UO) has commented on this as something he tried to avoid in<br/>
UO, and despite the problems UO has, I think most would agree<br/>
the world there is a lot more dynamic and fosters developing<br/>
communities than the EQ world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is like a moment locked in time, it never changes.  No matter what anyone<br/>
&gt; does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, regardless what level<br/>
&gt; the real folk have gotten to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is unchanging.  Join a massively<br/>
&gt; online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!  There is no ongoing plot.<br/>
&gt; Everything is the same.  It always has been, always will.  McQuaid wants<br/>
&gt; people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, when they buy them or<br/>
&gt; find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost when it&#39;s always that<br/>
&gt; same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why I advocate being able to loot each special item<br/>
only once.  After you do, that plotline is essentially over<br/>
for you, and you have to move on.  The unchanging plot does<br/>
not bother me so much as the campers who exploit it to harvest<br/>
items for sale or twink (thus interfering with other people&#39;s <br/>
ability to complete the plotline).<br/>
