<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014093243">wrong, the ss gloves can be used at any level, its a permanent effect, great<br/>
to raise swimming skill in felwithe, arm your jig of vigor song, hit autorun<br/>
and find a nice little corner in the water to keep swimming against and go<br/>
watch a movie.  <br/>
<br/>
I think my swimming is 196 now.  Its the only thing i could do at one point<br/>
due to extreme lag and going LD. i decided to raise swimming skill instead<br/>
of dying to router problems in the states.<br/>

right click effects. If someone is going to use the entry level area they<br/>
are really better off just making friends with a shaman, druid or ranger.<br/>
Rebreathers and waterstones are great as well. The problem with bringing a<br/>
mage down there is that soon they realize they don&#39;t need help.<br/>

a nice little AoE dispell and not all of us had Fishbone earrings, it gives<br/>
us a few more seconds to get a breath on the dispelled person.<br/>
