<div id="ygrps-yiv-587111443">Have to agree, I&#39;ve been using my Journeyman (Tash) stick since about 45th<br/>
and it&#39;s awesome. The proc message seems bugged so I never know if it goes<br/>
off unless I see the message that the effect wore off and the mob rarely<br/>
lasts that long. (I have spell effects turned off.)<br/>
<br/>
From group member reports however, it goes off almost every fight. Hits<br/>
pretty good too. I usually have it in my primary and a blackjack in<br/>
secondary. Weak weapons at 52 I know, but I don&#39;t play enough to wheel and<br/>
deal for upgrades in GFay. Still waiting for my BoH to drop :-).<br/>

Have to agree -- always put the faster weapon in primary. the tash stick<br/>
is an awesome weapon for a bard. So many of our songs get resisted and the<br/>
stick should help quite a lot with that.<br/>
