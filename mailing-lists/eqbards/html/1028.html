<b>Subject:</b> Disarming Traps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-664267881">Reading disenchantment thread, and agree wholeheartedly, but if it&#39;s any<br/>
consolation, we&#39;re a jack-of-many-useless skills anyway, master of none.<br/>
Thieves have long been complaining about detect/disarm traps and pick lock.<br/>
I rarely see any doors to be picked, though there seems to be more of those<br/>
than traps.  Then I&#39;ve read so many thieves complaining how most parties<br/>
would rather not have a thief amoung their ranks, regardless of the group&#39;s<br/>
level (Bards are highly desired at one point, at least).<br/>
<br/>
It got me to thinking about the classic CRPGs, how when you went to create<br/>
your group of adventurers, it would come down to 2 warriors, 2 spellcasters,<br/>
but at least one thief!  You -had- to have a thief, or at least a class that<br/>
could substitute for a thief like a ninja/monk type or jester/bard.  Reason<br/>
was: every encounter involved monsters dropping a trapped chest that needed<br/>
disarmed.  Hell, remember is Wizardry how my thief stood behind the<br/>
warriors, never fighting, just following along to pick any locks and disarm<br/>
after every battle.<br/>
<br/>
So what if that happened here?  Could you imagine the uproar?  :)  Say,<br/>
someone&#39;s in Crushbone.  They kill one of these humanoid creatures, and any<br/>
weapon or shield/armor the orc was wielding can be snatched up easily.  But<br/>
they also see a trapped chest in there, for all humanoid monsters now keep<br/>
their valuables in such boxes.  Within the chest is probably just coins, but<br/>
perhaps the orc was storing his valued shiny brass shield in that chest, not<br/>
wielding it.  Regardless, the player can simply open the chest and set it<br/>
off.  Either a minor explosion, poison, stun, things like that.  Nothing so<br/>
great as to kill the player, but enough a threat that the player must be<br/>
certain things are safe in the area before they loot.  The player would then<br/>
have to weigh leaving the corpse there a while for safety, or someone<br/>
eventually being able to steal their prize.  I think it would make things<br/>
more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
If a thief is in the area, even not in the other player&#39;s group, the thief<br/>
could just use the disarm skill on the corpse itself (not having to go in<br/>
loot mode to see the trapped chest itself), removing the trap for the other<br/>
fellow.  Once set off or disarmed, the box itself would vanish.  Could<br/>
imagine said thief running around Crushbone disarming corpses to increase<br/>
skill, instantly becoming a local hero, people sending shouts for him to<br/>
&quot;come over here!&quot;  Do high-level magic users get a Knock spell equivalent?<br/>
Maybe they should, maybe they shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I used the /feedback option to suggest this, doubt it&#39;ll ever happen though,<br/>
but remember to use that option yourself for ideas like this (and send my<br/>
idea too if you like, maybe it&#39;ll one day happen that way).  As it stands<br/>
now, who cares about traps?  What, there&#39;s like one trap in the whole game?<br/>
I like my idea because I just know how irritated it would get people, heheh.<br/>
In Everquest, unlike other CRPGs, a thief is not required for a<br/>
well-balanced party, yet I think they should be.<br/>

&gt;I really love playing a bard, so don&#39;t get me wrong - but in light of the<br/>
&gt;things I have been hearing on this thread it seems like maybe we should all<br/>
&gt;get together and petition Verant to throw us bards a frickin bone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean, to have to wait all that time just to get the thieving skills and<br/>
&gt;then to have them max out at 35 and 40 what use are they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would you really be using the sneak skill when it is maxed at 35?  Who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cares<br/>

&gt;I intend to continue playing this class and really am having a good time, I<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dual wield at 17 is really cool, and Bellows in place of kick is fine, but<br/>
&gt;why no dual attack?  Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in beta<br/>
&gt;and had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>
&gt;areas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is very<br/>
&gt;weak in.  Am I totally off base?  I mean why give me the capability to have<br/>
&gt;skills I will never be very good at?<br/>

&gt;&gt; I agree with you on most of that, and if all the other magic<br/>
&gt;&gt; classes turn<br/>
&gt;&gt; out to be the same, maybe I&#39;ll try a monk or warrior. And<br/>
&gt;&gt; alot of the really<br/>
&gt;&gt; usefull stuff that makes us versatile isnt untill the higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels.Disarm<br/>
&gt;&gt; Trap is 30th, Pick locks is 40th, and track is 35th....Maybe I am just<br/>
&gt;&gt; expecting to much, I dont know<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;only usefull ones. Any other magic class usually has a<br/>
&gt;&gt; variety of usefull<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;spells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same<br/>
&gt;&gt; 4 or 5 spell<br/>
&gt;&gt; over<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and over again. They switch them around considering what<br/>
&gt;&gt; the situation<br/>
&gt;&gt; calls<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Gotta disagree here.  As an enchanter, I generally had a<br/>
&gt;&gt; standard &quot;spell<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;kit&quot; that I seldom changed.  As a Bard my song kit is much<br/>
&gt;&gt; the same, but as<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I get more protective songs they will take some precedence.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Note one VERY important thing:  We are NOT defined by our<br/>
&gt;&gt; songs the way<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;spellcasters are defined by their spells.  We are also middlin-fair<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;warriors (You watch a wiz try to go toe to toe with a fast<br/>
&gt;&gt; melee mob and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;see who&#39;s still standing).  We are also the SINGLE MOST<br/>
&gt;&gt; VERSATILE CLASS IN<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;THE GAME.  Read that sentence again.  There is NOTHING we<br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t do:  pick<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;locks, disarm traps, put monsters to sleep, heal our party,<br/>
&gt;&gt; hide our party,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;take our party underwater....  Bards in EQ are the<br/>
&gt;&gt; single-most powerful<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bard class I&#39;ve ever played (and this is from someone who&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; played Bard in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;nearly every conceivable RPG).<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;As has been stated before, we enhance a party.  If you want<br/>
&gt;&gt; to convert a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bard to a mathematical formula, where fighters = 1, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; spellchuckers = 1,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;and Clerics = 1, Bards = x2 multiplier.  We make everyone better.<br/>
