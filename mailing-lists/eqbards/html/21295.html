Verant will pay for what it does when it comes out with Star Wars and EQ2.<br/>
People are too ingrained in EQ to leave just for &quot;bad attitude&quot; (ofr the<br/>
most part, obviously a few ARE leaving).<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way.  You or your guild guild decides to go to a Sci-Fi<br/>
setting game next.  Anarachy Online and Star Wars are sitting there on the<br/>
shelf next to each other.  You&#39;ve heard mixed reveiws for both products.<br/>
<br/>
Which one are you going to try first?<br/>
<br/>
Repeat the same situation for Shadowbane and EQ2.</div>
