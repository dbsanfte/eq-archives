<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104342689">We had tried pulling Dojorn to the 3rd isle with no luck as well (back in<br/>
the levitating days of Air).  Now we take him on on his own isle.  One of<br/>
the Paladin&#39;s in our guild has found a way to trick the two Bladestorms into<br/>
leaving the island so we are able to fight Dojorn solo.  I will try to<br/>
observe his techinique next time he go up there.  The full loot list from<br/>
Dojorn last night was a Warrior haste belt, Golden Efreeti Bow (ranger quest<br/>
item), and Golden Efreeti Greeves.   On our first Dojorn kill we got 4 items<br/>
but 3 rotted due to confusion in the post-kill rezing order.  This time we<br/>
did pre-lotto rolls per class for whatever dropped, saved alot of trouble in<br/>
that precious 8 mins post-kill time.<br/>
<br/>
Also Dojorn is pretty much immune to magic.  So it is melee, melee, melee.<br/>
Our group got waxed as BOTH our healers went LD as soon as the battle<br/>
started :(  We had about 45 people there I believe.<br/>

Hey Rokenn, I noticed your post on the Concert Hall where you mentioned that<br/>
you killed Noble Dojorn.<br/>
This is something we&#39;ve been wanting to do ourselves, but aren&#39;t sure how to<br/>
go about it.  We&#39;ve tried to pull him from his island to Gorgalosk island,<br/>
but he always seems to get stuck inside his windmill.  We&#39;ve pulled the<br/>
bladestorms without any problem, but haven&#39;t been able to get Dojorn to come<br/>
out.  Have you guys pulled him?  Or is there something I&#39;m missing?  Also,<br/>
how many people did you have when you took him down?<br/>
<br/>
