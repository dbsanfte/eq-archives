Now - I hate to go on another rant - and I guess GZ is trying to be &quot;cute&quot;<br/>
but every class gets a detailed description of their new spells - while<br/>
bards essentially get the new song&#39;s names...  Some of them you can<br/>
certainly figure out what he means - like &quot;Attack Speed verses from Vilia &quot;<br/>
but others like &quot;A few notes from Solon &quot; gives us little to no information.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast this with<br/>

ENCHANTER<br/>
Look for:<br/>
<br/>
New Charms, including one that is neigh well irresistible<br/>
<br/>
Powerful Buffs, including:<br/>
<br/>
a.. Many attack speed buffs<br/>
b.. An upgrade to Augmentation, Shadow and Berserker Spirit<br/>
c.. A new Clarity, single and group versions<br/>
d.. Upgrades to Insight, Brilliance and Adorning Grace<br/>
e.. Rune V<br/>
