<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987605219">Thanks for all the armor suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Lockjaw&#39;s Vest is obviously from that big croc Lockjaw in Oasis,<br/>
right?  I&#39;m still having a hard time picturing why I&#39;d find a vest<br/>
made of that croc&#39;s hide when I loot the croc.<br/>
<br/>
And Crush&#39;s Tunic is obviously loot on Crush in Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
What level are these two mobs?  I doubt my level 11 can handle it,<br/>
even in a group of level 15&#39;s.  So I&#39;ll probably end up buying it.<br/>
<br/>
I spent 50pp last night on a Dragoon Dirk when I visited Kelethin.  I<br/>
know it&#39;s a lot compared to the 20pp from days past, but with the<br/>
change in lore items and the rarity of the dirk on Dvinn, I think I<br/>
got a good price compared to what it soon will be worth ... about<br/>
75pp.  (The guy was actually still auctioning the item while I was<br/>
giving him money.  Can you imagine the nerve???  Oh well, I could<br/>
have roleplayed it out, but I was too happy with my new weapon).<br/>
<br/>
Yes ... weight is becoming a major issue to me since I hunt primarily<br/>
for pelts.  And that&#39;s also why I solo -- usually, only other tailors<br/>
will hunt cats.  Everyone else is camping the orcs down.<br/>
<br/>
But I actually prefer group hunting when I&#39;m not in the mood to<br/>
tailor.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.  If I&#39;m lucky, I&#39;ll make some handmade backpacks soon ...<br/>
but first, I have to make some small and medium studded and<br/>
reinforced.<br/>
<br/>
later guys!  If you have more suggestions and info, I&#39;d appreciate<br/>
it!<br/>
