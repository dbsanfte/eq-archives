<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-474979767">I have heared many people mention that Selo&#39;s no longer breaks root.  Now I<br/>
thought that might be wrong, because I was breaking Ghoul Root, in Unrest<br/>
and Oasis, 2 days after the patch that caused it.  Even after doing this<br/>
probably a half a dozen times.  I chalked it up to conisidence.  But last<br/>
night I was fighting Orcs in Highpass, and I got rooted a couple of times<br/>
from... it was either Fanatic or Medic... when I clicked Selos&#39;s just to<br/>
see, both times I was released right when I got the boot symbol.  Has anyone<br/>
else noticed this.  Or has anyone else been unable to get unrooted?  Am I<br/>
just really lucky, or perhaps someone has an explanation.<br/>
