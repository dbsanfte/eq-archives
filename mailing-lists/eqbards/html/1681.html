&gt; Try to get your party to attack fewer mobs at one time - I know sometimes<br/>
&gt; they all get pulled in - but sometimes a cleric can lull a few while you<br/>
&gt; pull the other one or two away.  The party can gang the one or two then<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; back for the lulled ones.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s hard to get party members to follow even simple tactics but learning<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; use the assist command will really help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Can&#39;t agree with you more on using the /assist command.  However, I<br/>
have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>
are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>
people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>
enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>
the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them what<br/>
it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could do<br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
