<div id="ygrps-yiv-995164906">I have to agree with this as well.  You&#39;re much better off using your<br/>
Dragoon Dirk in your primary and secondary wield a barbed whip.  Quite<br/>
simply, the Dragoon Dirk is a superior weapons.  If you can get some Thulian<br/>
Claws or a Silvery War Axe, then I&#39;d move that to primary and the Dirk to<br/>
secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I just traded my Brazen Brass Kilij for Thulian Claws<br/>
lastnight.  I didn&#39;t realize that they carried so much clout (the Kilij).<br/>
Definitely gonna have to get another one.<br/>

One thing I would consider is replacing at least one of your two barbed<br/>
leather whips.  I used to dual wield a dragoon dirk and barbed leather whip.<br/>
In combats that lasted more than a minute, the barbed leather whip would<br/>
cause a serious stamina drain.  I would venture to guess that dual wielding<br/>
two of them is even more severe.  I now dual wield thulian claws (cost me<br/>
400PP) and a dragoon dirk.  In groups, very rarely does my stamina drop<br/>
below one bub anymore, even after long combats.  The only time it will drop<br/>
below one bub is if I am soloing a blue that takes me forever to kill.<br/>
Obviously you can avoid the stamina drain by singing the Jig but you could<br/>
free up that song slot and memorize a different song by equipping some<br/>
weapons lighter than the barbed leather whips.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.  <br/>

&gt; Well, I manage to accumulate some pp and now is the time to buy<br/>
&gt; stuff. ;-) I have my Level 20 song and I now want to optimize my<br/>
&gt; stats and stuff a little bit. I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>
&gt; message<br/>
&gt; then I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>
&gt; would not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>
&gt; and equipment. If you need to know<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>
&gt; the Dragoon Dirk. I can&#39;t afford Platinum jewelry.<br/>
