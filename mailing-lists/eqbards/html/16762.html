<b>Subject:</b> Is selos in a group a megataunt? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111888526">I have gotten in two *good* yard groups in Mistmoore the last two nights,<br/>
which I hear is rare, but I have been doing well. I like to keep Selos going<br/>
(with drum) in case one of the clockwork trains catches us and we have to<br/>
zone (in fact the warriors were routinly /following me during breaks just in<br/>
case). One thing I noticed was if something spawned or someone else pulled<br/>
something it headed right for me even if they started wacking it before it<br/>
arrived to begin pummeling me. Assuming it wasn&#39;t my breath, does anyone<br/>
else notice this?<br/>
