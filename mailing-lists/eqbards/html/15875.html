<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707327999">crested is highest AC i know of for bards, that&#39;s what i wear (i know i lose<br/>
DEX, but i wanted to break 800 hehe) and i can&#39;t get a cloak upgrade with<br/>
only 500pp in the bank.  you can wear a hero bracer, i can&#39;t.  you also have<br/>
the advantage of wearing an imbrued helm full-time (i have to wear a froglok<br/>
crown, i have gotten *cough* screwed *cough* out of a couple tranix crowns,<br/>
but i am gonna be borrowing one soon).  i can only wear mine to give people<br/>
a laugh.  and i get 0 AC from my haste sash.  i have to save up a lot more<br/>
points and get lucky to grab an RBB.  very nice stuff Elwyn.  we have very<br/>
very similar equipment (the RBB being the biggest difference).  what&#39;s the<br/>
stats on the mithril torque?  i grabbed myself a runed lava pendant recently<br/>
for the neck slot.  i know the torques are easy as hell to get as most<br/>
people don&#39;t care one way or the other if they get one, unless that has<br/>
changed recently cause of its AC.<br/>

&gt; 815AC now, check it out if you&#39;re interested.  Can prolly <br/>
&gt; squeeze another 10<br/>
&gt; points with a cloak and shoulder upgrade.<br/>
&gt; Some of the stats might be off by a couple points, I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; updated them<br/>
&gt; since I changed around some equipment.  <br/>
