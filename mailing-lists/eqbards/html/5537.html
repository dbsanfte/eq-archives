<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823600245">Weird, I didn&#39;t experience that.  I would usually take less from the fire<br/>
shields than my compatriots do to my high resistances across the board. I<br/>
have Crush&#39;s tunic which adds +8 to fire and cold as well as magic so I have<br/>
pretty high resistance with Elemental up. I was using a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
exclusively at the time so I was hitting those bad boys a lot.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
sem to help against their melee attacks but against the shields it seemed to<br/>
work.  Also the gobs liked to lob fire spells as well it seemed and they<br/>
weren&#39;t much of a threat as I&#39;d resist most of the time.  I do seem to<br/>
remember some of the drakes were green, others blue and they were no threat<br/>
eally at all.  Its been a while as I level really slowly due to my<br/>
travelling urges, so maybe I&#39;ll swing back this week and check it out again.<br/>
I wonder if it was some combo of fire/magic resists that mattered.  Like<br/>
most of our things have an immediate check, plus another check when it<br/>
pulses, maybe elemental spells have an elemental check, plus another magic<br/>
check as well.  Elemental for reduced damge, Magic for no damage or vice<br/>
versus.  Worth checking out.  I did notice that with my drum I was able to<br/>
resist 6 consecutive charms from an /con&#39;d red evil eye while guarding a<br/>
party thru Beholder in search of corpses two days ago.  When he sucessfully<br/>
Tashan&#39;d me I fled, fortunately the party was all near the zone by then.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m thinking Lavastorm.  I&#39;ve had some fun ther at 16th, and it requires a<br/>
&gt; bit different strategy thn normal.  How many people weave Elemental<br/>
Rhythyms<br/>
&gt; as a full time part of their attack strategy?  In Lavastorm its a<br/>
&gt; requirement with al the hot monsters there.  There will be a lot of things<br/>
<br/>
Does Elemental Rhythms really *do* anything to their attacks?<br/>
I know the drakes cast fire-based spells and the fire resist<br/>
help then, but they were mostly green to me at L16.  The fire<br/>
elementals have a fire shield, and ER didn&#39;t lower the damage<br/>
I took from that.  Nor did ER reduce the damage I took from<br/>
their melee attacks.  In fact, the best strategy I can think<br/>
of for Lavastorm is to have a caster cancel the elementals&#39;<br/>
fire shield (pretty sure this can be done - works on barbed<br/>
bones).  Mobs have so many hp you wind up taking a ridiculous<br/>
amount of damage from the shields alone.<br/>
