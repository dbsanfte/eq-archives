 </span></blockquote>For those wondering, this bug happens (lore items disappear when dropped)<br/>
when they are in a bag.  So long as you do transfers of all lore items<br/>
outside of bags, even if you accidentally drop it, the item should be there<br/>
laying on the ground where you dropped it.  If its in a bag when its<br/>
dropped, however, POOF!<br/>
