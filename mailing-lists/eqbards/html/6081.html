&gt;Have you been using a minotaur horn, or a flute, hon? When I first hit 16, I <br/>
&gt;doubled up on swimming and wind by equipping my wooden flute, jumping in the <br/>
&gt;water at the mage guilde in Freeport, firing up Tarew&#39;s and going about my <br/>
&gt;daily life for a few hours. Got to 81 or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The minotaur horn doesn&#39;t show the flute animation, but I&#39;d swear it doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;practice wind, either. I tried practicing in the pond in Halas with a horn, <br/>
&gt;when afk for a good bit, and saw zero improvement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;m getting at here is this: does the minotaur horn actually use the <br/>
&gt;Wind skill? From what I&#39;ve observed, it doesn&#39;t seem to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that were the case, then I wouldn&#39;t be getting the wind skill<br/>
improvements I *have* gotten via CCC..<br/>
