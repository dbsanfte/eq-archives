think it&#39;s a terrible, non-descriptive term.  We try to use<br/>
weaving/juggling/trans-chord-demodulation instead, though<br/>
weaving seems to be the frontrunner.  JM (developer from<br/>

confusing when you refer to the previous &quot;cycle&quot; (is that the<br/>
previous song, or the previous set of songs?).<br/>

We won&#39;t hate you for using &quot;twisting.&quot; :-)  Just be aware<br/>
that there are other (IMHO better) terms for it.<br/>
