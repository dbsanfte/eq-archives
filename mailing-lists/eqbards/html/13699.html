&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; After reviewing this thread as well as some others on the other boards,<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; chatting with some of our inhouse people that play bards (we have several<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; those), we&#39;ve decided to decrease the taunt factor of the bard songs. This<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is not going to lead to a drastic change to how the bard class is played,<br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; bards need to know when to stop singing, but it should definatly be <br/>
&gt; noticible.<br/>
&gt; The problem centers around how a creatures hate-list works. Without going <br/>
&gt; into detail, creatures also hate people who cast beneficial spells on<br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; they hate. Since bards do this roughly every 6-12 seconds, it can get a<br/>
&gt; bit <br/>
&gt; dangerous<br/>
