&gt;Actually I start Chaining at the beginning of fights too since it also slows<br/>
&gt;attacks by  30% or so ;-)  I also sing Warsong if I&#39;m pretending to be a<br/>
&gt;tank even when Alacrity&#39;d for the extra strength.  I have seen a lot of the<br/>
&gt;other behaviors you are describing though when playing my non-bard<br/>
&gt;characters with other bards.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since I&#39;m not the soloing type with any of my characters, I had no idea so<br/>
&gt;many bards soloed into the 40s or higher.  I knew that druids and necros<br/>
&gt;often did it, obviously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This certainly explains a lot, though.  Sooner or later, most of those<br/>
&gt;soloers get a taste for toys that lures them into dungeons, where they<br/>
&gt;proceed to be completely useless members of a group, wasting a slot and<br/>
&gt;often getting the group killed through sheer lack of ability to play their<br/>
&gt;class in a group setting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having grown up as a bard, I didn&#39;t get to see these bards in action.  I<br/>
&gt;mean, how often do you see two bards in a dungeon group?  However, now that<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m playing an enchanter, I get to see lots of bards.  And what I see often<br/>
&gt;disturbs me.  They sing haste, even though it doesn&#39;t stack with my haste.<br/>
&gt;They sing dots in an attempt to do as much damage as possible (soloing<br/>
&gt;attitude, I&#39;m guessing).  They start chaining the mob at the beginning of<br/>
&gt;the combat.  They practice instill doubt during combat.  They pull out<br/>
&gt;instruments at innapropriate times.  They cry like children when you ask<br/>
&gt;them to play mana.  Ask them to keep 2 targets mezzed and they look at you<br/>
&gt;funny.  In short, the bards I&#39;m grouping with seem so clueless about their<br/>
&gt;class that they&#39;re actually detrimental to the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are these the bards who grew up kiting, charm-kiting or duoing?  When I<br/>
&gt;played a bard, I saw how a bard who wasn&#39;t interested in outdamaging the<br/>
&gt;warriors could uplift a group and make them able to do great things.  The<br/>
&gt;bards I group with now can&#39;t even understand why aggroing a mob is a bad<br/>
&gt;thing, and don&#39;t put those actions together with the cleric shouting OOM and<br/>
&gt;the resulting evac/run for the zone/death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s kind of a sad thing to see, really.  And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m harder on the<br/>
&gt;bard class than on others I see not being played very well, because I grew<br/>
&gt;up as one.  But it really is painful and disheartening that when I see two<br/>
&gt;or three people shouting for a group, and one of them is a bard...  Out of<br/>
&gt;hard-learned experience, I&#39;ll take one of the other two people over the<br/>
&gt;bard.  If I know the bard, and know that s/he is a good one, I&#39;ll add him or<br/>
&gt;her to the group.  But if all 3 are strangers, the bard almost never wins.<br/>
&gt;Sucks if I pass up a great bard who would have made the night fly by with<br/>
&gt;tons of xp and fun, but the odds are against it.  Chances are the bard is<br/>
&gt;one of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t be very helpful in the group.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is sooooo hard when I&#39;m playing other classes when I&#39;m grouped with a <br/>
bard, but I bite try to bit my tongue (sometimes unsuccessfully) as I think <br/>
it&#39;s inappropriate to tell people how to play their class. But since my <br/>
other character is 28, I run into a lot of bards who have not studied much. <br/>
I&#39;m always happy to offer tips, but most newbie bards would rather beg for <br/>
equipment from me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you run into your share of other &quot;bad&quot; players in every class. But <br/>
a bad bard or enchanter brings far less to the group than a bad warrior (at <br/>
least he can press his autoattack key). Be careful of holding other people <br/>
to &quot;our&quot; high standards. Imagine if you are one of those bards who didn&#39;t <br/>
get to stand on the shoulders of all those bards before us who tested all <br/>
combinations of songs and develop all these strategies that we use. :-) I&#39;m <br/>
sure we&#39;d come up with a bunch on our own, but you have the assistance of <br/>
others with fine tuning those ideas and who have shared experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been finding pickup groups in Nagafen&#39;s Lair and have grouped with <br/>
other bards occasionally. One night we had 3 bards in the group (Hi <br/>
Musiker!). Was a hoot. I haven&#39;t run into a &quot;bad&quot; bard in a long time at my <br/>
level (45).<br/>
