<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639398053">Wow awesome expedition.  I assume this is before they beefed up the zone<br/>
last night?  If it was after, then even more impressive.  After they made<br/>
the zone even tougher, i heard even groups of your caliber were slaughtered.<br/>
And one other question...<br/>
<br/>
The bracers are No Drop did YOU get them???<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually the armour is much more gold looking than yellow and <br/>
&gt; it looks very<br/>
&gt; nice actually. We found a pair of golden arms from the vile <br/>
&gt; plane off of a<br/>
&gt; boogyman (yes thats right, a boogyman). They are bard only, <br/>
&gt; had excellent<br/>
&gt; ac, but gave int as their stat. As far as i always thought <br/>
&gt; int sucks for a<br/>
&gt; bard so the arms are not that great, besides the pretty gold <br/>
&gt; sheen and the<br/>
&gt; nice ac. I have heard all kinds of rumors about the plane, <br/>
&gt; from you being<br/>
&gt; instantly teleported the moment you set your foot in the door by Cazic<br/>
&gt; Thule himself to a random location to other assorted garbage. <br/>
&gt; Everytime i<br/>
&gt; have set foot through that gate i have had no problem as long <br/>
&gt; as i dont<br/>
&gt; move. We had a very succesful fear expedition that involved <br/>
&gt; 23 people, all<br/>
&gt; lvl 40-50. We got more than a few stunningly cool pieces of <br/>
&gt; equipment and<br/>
&gt; had a very fun time with nobody dying. Thats not to say the plane isnt<br/>
&gt; freaking rough, there are all manors of things hell bent on <br/>
&gt; seperating you<br/>
&gt; from your group. Tentacle Tormenters that will belt you 300 <br/>
&gt; feet straight<br/>
&gt; up (some people taking 700pts of dmg when they finally fell <br/>
&gt; back down),<br/>
&gt; Scarelings that will teleport you randomly away, and little <br/>
&gt; bitty toadies<br/>
&gt; that like to inflict fear upon you (a more deadly spell in <br/>
&gt; that zone i dont<br/>
&gt; think exists). We slaughtered a slew of strange beasties <br/>
&gt; before we finally<br/>
&gt; decided to call it a night and evac&#39;d out (yes there is a <br/>
&gt; portal out, no<br/>
&gt; you would most likely die trying to get to it).<br/>
