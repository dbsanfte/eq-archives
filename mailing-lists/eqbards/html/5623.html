&gt; Well I am completely confused on this issue.  I have had two types of<br/>
&gt; invisibility spells cast on me.  One is the magic user type that just shows<br/>
&gt; &quot;Invisibility&quot; when you right click on the icon.  The second one is the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Invisibility to Undead&quot; that clerics and paladins can cast.  I was always<br/>
&gt; under the impression that our invisibility song functioned like the magic<br/>
&gt; user type Invisibility spell and as a result was no good against undead,<br/>
&gt; which I assumed had the innate ability to See Invisiblility (otherwise why<br/>
&gt; have a distinct spell for it).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dunno why the difference, but it&#39;s always worked against most<br/>
undead for me.  It doesn&#39;t work against *some* undead.  I<br/>
believe greater skeletons(?) can see through it - even though<br/>
they are green and don&#39;t attack me anymore, they always /con<br/>
ready to attack when I have the song up.  But it really really<br/>
does work against most undead I&#39;ve run across (hags, ghouls,<br/>
various types of skeletons, etc), and as of my experience last<br/>
week, still does, at least at level 30.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These leads into another question, John stated that sometimes the hag casts<br/>
&gt; See Invisibility on the mobs and thats why they still attack you when you<br/>
&gt; sing the song.  What about other types of mobs?  Do any creatures out there<br/>
&gt; have the innate ability to See Invisibility or do they have to also cast the<br/>
&gt; See Invisibility spell?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a mob is much higher than you, it can usually see through<br/>
invisibility.  It seems to depend on the mob though.  Early<br/>
on, most giants could see through it (haven&#39;t tested it<br/>
lately), but it worked just fine on griffins.  Also, while in<br/>
Guk, we found that invisibility cast by a L31 enchanter worked<br/>
on the frogs, but invisibility cast by a L19 enchanter didn&#39;t.<br/>
So the level of the caster/singer is what matters.<br/>
<br/>
My friends who use invisibility potions (10.5pp at an<br/>
alchemy/herb shop) say the potions are pretty potent and make<br/>
them invisible to lots of things that could see them through<br/>
other forms of invisibility.<br/>
