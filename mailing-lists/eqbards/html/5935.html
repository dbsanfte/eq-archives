<div id="ygrps-yiv-311153106">heh heh, my best guess would be sing &#39;em a lullaby, smoke your target, flee!<br/>
Quickly return and loot the corpse or have a friend hide and loot it while<br/>
you flee!  I have had good luck in Upper Guk using lament and lullaby, but I<br/>
just ignore the greens and let em womp me so they don&#39;t run then flee! to<br/>
the zone and return for looting.<br/>

I love cazic.  Perfect place for a bard if you ask me,<br/>
not too much stunning from mobs, it&#39;s out doors so you<br/>
can use selo&#39;s.  I gain tons from going there each<br/>
time.  But I have a problem.  I often bank in FP. <br/>
Which means I run past guk.  Ah, guk, a deathtrap for<br/>
bards.  Using 70% of our songs in that dungeons will<br/>
get you trained faster than standing outside a weight<br/>
watchers meeting door when the ice cream truck rolls<br/>
by.  But I hear voices.  &quot;Come to guk&quot;  &quot;troll hide<br/>
belt in guk&quot; &quot;lots of items you like in guk&quot;  &quot;yes, my<br/>
precious, the yellow light, it burns my skin&quot;.  9<br/>
times out of ten I stop in guk on my trips, with<br/>
always the same result:  me, 20 frogs, and a fear run<br/>
to the zone.  Why?  Why can&#39;t I solo one stinking blue<br/>
in guk?  Why do the frogs hate me so?  I just want a<br/>
few shiny baubles and I&#39;ll be on my way.  Our root<br/>
even when it works won&#39;t stop them, just slow them,<br/>
and 2 blues is an even quicker death.  At 27 my melee<br/>
alone just doesn&#39;t cut it, but if I use any damage<br/>
songs, it&#39;s a parade of kermit&#39;s singing &quot;It&#39;s not<br/>
easy beeing green&quot; followed by a Loading, please<br/>
wait...<br/>
<br/>
Please, does anyone have any info that will let me<br/>
knock off just one blue in guk?  Just one, thats all I<br/>
ask.<br/>

(two froglock guards sit in a chair as a bard goes<br/>
running past them at full speed followed by half a<br/>
dungeon, one says to the other in a souther voice)<br/>
&quot;you reckon that er bards dun riled em froggies up?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I reckon&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ma, git my gun&quot;<br/>
