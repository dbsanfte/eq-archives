<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856278615">I have had a dickens of a time fighting Hornets in Burning Woods.  My<br/>
Guildmates love the place and have been spending a lot of time there.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if something changed (patch-wise or our tactics) but the first<br/>
several times I was there everything went great.<br/>
<br/>
	Last week - when I&#39;m around they seem to go Aggro like Songer described.<br/>
This is fighting near the Hornets nest.  Every time I grouped in BW I died<br/>
at least once - once twice.  And it&#39;s a tough zone to find a rez.<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m sticking to Outside Fironia.  I&#39;ve only died there twice - both times<br/>
basically my fault.  Once when away from group on a corpse locate - and<br/>
another when we only had 4 in group - and I thought I could run to zone -<br/>
when Paladin would have LoH - but I was too far away..<br/>
<br/>
	Anyway - the loot is possibly better in BW - I once looted a 51 Wizard<br/>
spell (lost it in lotto) - the best I&#39;ve seen outside Karnor&#39;s is a Black<br/>
Pearl..<br/>
