<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156251249">Here is a thought and a story, maybe even a partial solution.  Perhaps the Mobs are<br/>
angry at you because you have been killing so many of their friends.  I was in North<br/>
Karanas around levels 11 through 14 killing beetles with my party.  We noticed an<br/>
odd effect which we called &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.  It seems that after I had gone out to<br/>
fetch a dozen or so pincers, borers, and scythe bettles, that every beetle in the<br/>
zone became aggressive towards me, the fetching bard.  Normally, these beetles are<br/>
not aggressive at all.  Suddenly after fetching and killing lots of them, they all<br/>
become aggressive and they ALL start running across the entire zone to hunt me<br/>
down.  I am not kidding.  This happened.  It was rather convenient, but eventually<br/>
became overwhelming.  The solution, however, was easy.  I just had to zone out and<br/>
back, and they were all passive again.<br/>
<br/>
I have hunted in Crushbone and Befallen a lot, and I have noticed that I am a<br/>
preferred target, but not to the extent being reported in this thread.  I have never<br/>
had a Thug ignore a party that was fighting it to come and fight me *if* I had not<br/>
done anything personal to it.  I have also spent a lot of time in Derv camps in<br/>
Wcommons, NRO, and SRO.  Perhaps you are just so succesful killing these mobs they<br/>
are developing a collective hatred for you&lt;g&gt;.  Anyway, try zoning and coming back,<br/>
and good luck.<br/>

&gt; I think you may not be witnessing the complaint here. At least some of us will<br/>
&gt; be standing somewhere, farther away from mobs than other players, NOT singing,<br/>
&gt; maybe not even in a group. Someone else attacks a mob. One or more mobs rush<br/>
&gt; past the attacker and attack &lt;me&gt; the bard. </span></blockquote></div>
