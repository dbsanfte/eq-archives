<div id="ygrps-yiv-881899955">Last night, I was having really horrible packet loss.  It was<br/>
typically 4% to 12%, with spikes over 60%.  I found that this made it<br/>
practically impossible to stay invisible with Shauri&#39;s.  (I am level<br/>
31 and have a wind skill of 158 or better, so under normal conditions,<br/>
it&#39;s not a problem.)  However, although I often saw the blue &quot;You have<br/>
become visible&quot; message, it rarely--if ever--followed the red &quot;You<br/>
feel yourself starting to appear&quot; message.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m speculating that the client is trying to get a packet through that<br/>
says &quot;Hey!  I&#39;m still singing Shauri&#39;s.&quot;  However, if this packet<br/>
keeps disappearing into the ether, then the song interval times out on<br/>
the server, and the server figures I&#39;ve stopped singing, so I become<br/>
visible.  Eventually, the client manages to get the packet through,<br/>
and a soft mist surrounds me again.  <br/>
<br/>
In any event, the lessons I learned are:<br/>
<br/>
1) When it says &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear,&quot; you probably<br/>
   won&#39;t become visible.<br/>
<br/>
2) When it doesn&#39;t say &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear,&quot; you<br/>
   still may very well become visible.<br/>
