&gt; &gt; Essentially, DoT spells do not damage the<br/>
&gt; &gt; NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is if I&#39;m casting a DoT on a mob<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s fairly far away (to pull) and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; running towards me and &quot;has a velocity&quot; the<br/>
&gt; DoT isn&#39;t going to do damage for the time<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s running? Granted, we&#39;re not talking about<br/>
&gt; a lot of damage here, but I&#39;ve been in battles<br/>
&gt; that were evenly matched hp to hp where I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; won with only a few hitpoints (&lt;10) left. Those<br/>
&gt; initial 5-10+ points that would have been<br/>
&gt; done could make / break the fight. (Please don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell me I should have ran. Many times I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; an NPC down to their last bubble when they<br/>
&gt; turned into Rocky friggin Balboa on me and<br/>
&gt; whipped my butt.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what the extra duration is for, to balance out<br/>
the lost damage during the pull </span></blockquote></div>
