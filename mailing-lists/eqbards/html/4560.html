<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139184566">From your description - it&#39;s sounds to me like you are soloing?  While there<br/>
are others here who adamantly disagree with me - IMHO (oops<br/>
In-My-Humble-Opinion) Bards are a horrible class to try to solo.  You should<br/>
be grouping.  Make some friends group with them.  Once you can have people<br/>
you can trust - ask if they will hold your loot for you...<br/>
<br/>
At level 11 - I recall I was in medium-to-large sized group fighting<br/>
monsters that were all red to me.<br/>
<br/>
Level 11 means you&#39;ve invested a good amount of time - I think it would be a<br/>
tough to start all over..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>
&gt; monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>
&gt; damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>
&gt; blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>
&gt; few times while I heal up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>
&gt; the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>
&gt;  Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>
&gt; running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>
&gt; HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>
&gt; encumberance penalties.<br/>
