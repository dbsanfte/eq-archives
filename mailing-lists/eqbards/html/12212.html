<div id="ygrps-yiv-450015988">I would say that was total crap thing to do.  If the guy was guilded, I&#39;d be<br/>
writing to his guild leader.  If you got a server email list or a server web<br/>
BBS (Playervault, whatever) I&#39;d be posting there.  That&#39;s a total crap<br/>
situation.  <br/>
<br/>
This whole story is a prime example of how being in a guild can make life so<br/>
much better.  Having guild members in the group can make a world of<br/>
difference.  And having high level guild members can make really hard CR<br/>
much easier (wolf form is non-agro to most stuff in Unrest) and you don&#39;t<br/>
need to worry about consenting a guild member to drag you out.<br/>
<br/>
But guilded or not - I would not have left until everyone was CR&#39;d.  <br/>

Had a bad situation last night in the ghost room in Unrest.  Want to run it<br/>
by everyone to get your opinion.  <br/>

I was bound in GFAY.  Before I could finish memming my songs, the group<br/>
leader (the shaman) said he had to leave so he could complete one of the<br/>
shaman armor quests. <br/>
<br/>
Was wondering what the general consensus is with you guys on the shaman&#39;s<br/>
behavior.  In every group I have been in so far everyone stuck around until<br/>
everyone got their corpse back, especially the group leader.  I was totally<br/>
appalled by the shaman&#39;s behavior.  This was far and away the maddest I have<br/>
been since I have been playing.  It was also the first time I have ever<br/>
gotten into a /tell argument with someone over any issue.  Anyone who has<br/>
ever grouped with me can tell you that I can get along with just about<br/>
anybody.  This guy pushed me beyond my limits though.  Was I out of line for<br/>
expecting the group leader to stick around?    <br/>
