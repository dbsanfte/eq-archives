<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192462076">I&#39;m in a similar boat as you; but I&#39;ve made a lot of close friends (one or<br/>
two non-guilded) the other rest in various guilds.  A possible factor is<br/>
that their guilds lack many (or even any) Bards at similar level) - so I<br/>
often through tells set up groups.  For example last Friday I got a tell<br/>
from one of my buddies that they have room for one more in the Hole - and<br/>
they arrange a TP to get me...<br/>
<br/>
As far as larger activities - on Xegony we&#39;ve formed an organization called<br/>
The Xegony Alliance of people from small-mid sized guilds where we schedule<br/>
raids together.  It has been enormously successful (from our perspective at<br/>
least).   We&#39;ve done Fear, Hate, Growth, Kael, Valk&#39;s Lab,  Vox, Nag to name<br/>
a few.<br/>
<br/>
There are like 300 people who have registered their chars on the website.<br/>
If you&#39;re interested - the website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xegonyalliance.com">http://www.xegonyalliance.com</a><br/>
<br/>
It started out simply as an idea and an EZ-Board Forum.  Of course required<br/>
a few people willing to take the initiative to lead the first few raids -<br/>
but it grew very quickly as word spread about the raids...<br/>
<br/>
One side-effect of the XA is that is where I met a lot of the people on my<br/>
friends list now who I regularly group with...<br/>

<br/>
While not a bard related question, this seems like a good place to get some<br/>
feedback on this.<br/>
Elfson is 52 now (would be pretty far into it too, cept for 2 unrezzed death<br/>
this weekend, ugh).  I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>
disbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>
on during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>
guild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>
thrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>
specifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>
any trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>
at week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>
up in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>
was the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>
<br/>
So what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>
(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>
guild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>
play after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>
Something else?<br/>
