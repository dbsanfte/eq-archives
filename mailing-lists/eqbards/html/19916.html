&gt; Maybe it was 8 gold or so but they were concerned that teleporting classes<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Think about it, the fastest way to do this would be a Wizard (with JBoots)<br/>
porting to West Karana, or maybe a druid porting from North Karana<br/>
considering high level SoW or Scale of Wolf sould toast JBoots. Even at that<br/>
it&#39;s several minutes for 8gold and faction, I imagine not a lot of mail will<br/>
be flowing along that route.<br/>

Hey, has anyone done speed tests against Scale of Wolf? I had some fun the<br/>
other day racing a 26 druid friend from G Fay zone to Kaladim, he cheated<br/>
and used Spirit of Cheeta and I still nearly caught him. I&#39;m going for a<br/>
rematch when I get a MM battledrum<br/>
