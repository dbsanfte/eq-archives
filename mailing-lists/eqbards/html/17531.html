<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068298516">Last night we went for Lord Nagafen.  Success!  We got a book for our Palidan, Druid stick - Ally, Selo&#39;s Drums - Sylly, Scourge Hammer - Arif, GPK - not sure, Fire Emerald Ring - Ataras. Also, Crown of King Tranix, Mith Arms, Mask.  Pretty nice haul for a change.  We suffered 4 deaths on Nag and the fight was fun.  He got out on to the bridge and fell off into the lava - ugh!  We backed off quickly and he clambered out and fought on the far side of the bridge until he died.  <br/>
<br/>
I am pretty excited with Selos drums  and will be giving them a good workout.  Looks like PoF tonight - going to be a lot of hair standing on end and begining chanters I suspect &lt;eg&gt;.<br/>
