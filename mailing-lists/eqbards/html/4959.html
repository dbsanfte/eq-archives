<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bard Petition- Stealth Nerfing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636502826">ACK! Sent the draft insted of the final. Sorry, here is the correct<br/>
version. <br/>
<br/>
	[slinks away] <br/>
<br/>
	The petition should ask Verant to adopt an Open Disclosure <br/>
<br/>
	Policy which commits them to reveal ANY changes made to a <br/>
<br/>
	class which affects gameplay in the next patch message. <br/>
<br/>
	As we all know, Verant likes to &quot;stealth nerf&quot; classes and <br/>
<br/>
	Bards have probably been the biggest victim. Its basically <br/>
<br/>
	a form of cowardice in that they dont want to take the heat <br/>
<br/>
	for their actions. However, as paying customers I think it <br/>
<br/>
	is reasonable for us to have the right to know what is being <br/>
<br/>
	done to the characters we are paying to play and have invested <br/>
<br/>
	so much time into. Although other classes would benefit <br/>
<br/>
	from such an official disclosure policy, Bards have been the <br/>
<br/>
	hardest hit by this and as such it should be valid to include <br/>
<br/>
	it in a Bard petition. <br/>
<br/>
	On a side note, Brad and Smedley are always noting how much <br/>
<br/>
	thought and debate go into every change to a class. They claim<br/>
<br/>
	to agonize over every issue and debate it among the developers. <br/>
<br/>
	Therefore, it should not be very difficult for them to list these <br/>
<br/>
	changes since they should be well aware of them after so much<br/>
<br/>
	discussion. <br/>
