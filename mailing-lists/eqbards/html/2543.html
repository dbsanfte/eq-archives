 </span></blockquote>Kithicor is actually a great place for a bard to hunt between<br/>
about L10-20.  There are four undead spawn sites there, as<br/>
well as the Shralok orcs site (around L15-20).  The undead<br/>
sites tend to generate massive numbers of undead - I&#39;ve seen<br/>
as many as 7 zombies spawn on &quot;one&quot; spawn point.  At lower<br/>
levels, you just Lament a bunch of them and pick one off at a<br/>
time.  If Lament fails, kick in Accelerando and run for a<br/>
zone.  At higher levels, play with Discord and Dissonance to<br/>
kill them all at once.  And the best part is, so many people<br/>
hate Kithicor that there&#39;s rarely anyone there.  About the<br/>
only things you have to be careful of there are ghouls.<br/>
<br/>
Another odd thing I&#39;ve noticed is that only 4 or 5 undead will<br/>
attack you at once.  The rest start to run towards you, but<br/>
stop and stand (and sometimes even go back) once you&#39;re<br/>
engaged by this many. When one dies, one of the standing ones<br/>
runs in to take its place.  (If you have a friend though, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop them from attacking him.)  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s<br/>
always been like this with undead, or this is a recent change<br/>
to cut down on obscene insta-kill trains.  As I&#39;ve mentioned,<br/>
I once had a dozen orcs chasing me in Oasis.<br/>
