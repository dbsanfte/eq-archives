<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264681894">Yep, sounds right though i approached it from the aspect of reducing damage<br/>
by 30%.  should be same effect though I ended up with different end<br/>
variables.  I recall that with a delay of 30 and average damage per hit of<br/>
15 a 6 second round at 2/3 hit ratio Psalm was better when you got it.<br/>
<br/>
	2(.667)(5) &gt; 2(.667)(15)(.3)  is this true?<br/>
		note 15 is average dmg/hit not per round so multiply by hit%<br/>
and hits/rnd<br/>
<br/>
		6.67 &gt; 6.003		so yes, it fits my memory as well<br/>
<br/>
	Oh well back to checking coding for profit not fun here too!<br/>

&gt; Okay here&#39;s a challenge for you John(tm).  What is the equation to figure<br/>
&gt; out whether to use Psalm or Chains assuming 0% resist on the Chains?  I<br/>
&gt; think I did this at one point but can&#39;t find it now and recall it was<br/>
rather<br/>
&gt; complicated but came out to a simple result for log parser plug-ins once<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; solved all the equations.  ie at 5hp per hit what average damage per<br/>
&gt; hit/hits per second ratio would suggest that Psalm would be more effective<br/>
&gt; than Chains.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm vs. Bellow was a straight damage to damage comparison.  <br/>
Chain doesn&#39;t do damage, rather it increases your survival<br/>
duration, giving you more time to do damage via other means.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm does dps damage per hit.<br/>
You do Dp damage per &quot;round&quot; (excluding Psalm).<br/>
You have H hp.<br/>
<br/>
Mob hits N times per &quot;round&quot; (unchained).<br/>
Mob does d damage per hit.<br/>
Hence mob does Dm = N*d damage per &quot;round&quot; (unchained).<br/>
Chain increases time between hits by 30% (i.e. drops Dm by 30%).<br/>
Mob has M hp.  (H/M is the important figure)<br/>
<br/>
With Psalm, your survival time is (H/Dm) rounds.<br/>
With Chain, your survival time is (1.3*H/Dm) rounds.<br/>
<br/>
With Psalm, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/(Dp + N*dps) rounds.<br/>
With Chain, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/Dp rounds.<br/>
<br/>
The better song will have a better ratio of your survival time<br/>
to the mob&#39;s survival time.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm:  (H/Dm) / [M/(Dp+Dps)]  = (H/M) * (Dp+N*dps)/Dm<br/>
Chain:  (1.3*H/Dm) / (M/Dp)    = (H/M) * (1.3*Dp)/Dm<br/>
<br/>
Drop the common factors to get:<br/>
<br/>
Dp+N*dps &gt; 1.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>
<br/>
Which simplifies to:<br/>
<br/>
N*dps &gt; 0.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>
<br/>
N = number of times a mob hits you per &quot;round&quot;<br/>
dps = damage of Psalm per hit<br/>
Dp = your average damage per &quot;round&quot;<br/>
Assuming Chain is never resisted<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t double-checked the math in this, as I&#39;m pretty busy<br/>
coding.<br/>
