<div id="ygrps-yiv-849171318">Not a bard so I am not sure. What is the lvl limit on what you can charm at<br/>
50?  The two giant Ice giant spawn is nice in perma.  6 Minute spawn timer<br/>
and great money to be made.  Just a thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just to help alleviate the fears of any young bards that &quot;charm kiting&quot; is <br/>
dead or too difficult, I just wanted to say that I think it&#39;s still alive <br/>
and well. I&#39;m a very experienced charm-kiter and have gotten to level 50 <br/>
(yay!) primarily as a solo kiting bard due to my real life commitments, but <br/>
as I&#39;ve mentioned previously, with some practice anyone can get good at<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently been emptying the giant fort in the Eastern Wastes with a mix <br/>
of charm kiting and chant kiting whenever I pass by. Anyway, it&#39;s just the <br/>
same ol, same ol. Charm one and restart selo&#39;s, press my &quot;target nearest <br/>
npc&quot; key, press my &quot;/pet attack&quot; social, retarget my pet and wait for charm <br/>
to break. Once it does break, I repeat the process over and over and over. <br/>
Yea, kind of boring, but if you only have about 90 mins at a time to play, <br/>
it&#39;s a decent way to get exp and some money.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing the &quot;nerf&quot; really affects would be when you have a large <br/>
group of creatures that you&#39;re kiting. I did run into some trouble when I <br/>
accidentally aggro&#39;d an entire hut plus a giant captain (4 creatures). I <br/>
ended up dying (but I can blame that on my buddy kept distracting me asking <br/>
me questions over my shoulder). Pre-nerf, it was much easier since the mobs <br/>
would instantly turn on my pet. Having to try to reissue the pet attack <br/>
command with this many mobs is much more dangerous now and allows for a <br/>
very small margin for error.<br/>
<br/>
Some recommendations for what makes for a good charm kiting area:<br/>
<br/>
1) A nice quiet area where few mobs travel through<br/>
2) A busy area nearby to get your intended victims<br/>
3) Few trees<br/>
4) Nice flat plains-like area<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got my &quot;change views&quot; key setup as my &quot;+&quot; key on my keypad. I use my <br/>
keypad for movement, so this is very convenient for me. After I target my <br/>
&quot;pet&quot; and send him to attack my victim, I press my &quot;+&quot; key 3 times. This <br/>
gets me to the last external view before the first person perspective, so <br/>
that I only have to press the key once to get back to this view.<br/>
<br/>
Some places that I had very good experience charm kiting:<br/>
Rathe Mountains -- Great place for any high 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s bard. Can start <br/>
with cyclopses and work your way up to hill giants. Just zone if you get <br/>
too many (make sure you have a hot key warning people which zone you&#39;re <br/>
pulling them to). Drawbacks: can be very crowded with players and you can <br/>
end up going through hill giants so fast you clear the zone. Doesn&#39;t make <br/>
you very popular.<br/>
<br/>
Karanas -- In your 30&#39;s, Froon and Choon were good for charm kiting and I <br/>
think still are. The various griffenne&#39;s are lower, but they were helpful <br/>
to kill stuff with. Mid 30&#39;s you can start using griffons and hill giants <br/>
to clear things. Mid 40 I used grimfeather to kill stuff with (definitely <br/>
keep your speed up against him) :-)<br/>
<br/>
Dreadlands -- In your 40&#39;s this is a decent place to fight. I had good <br/>
experience charming primarily giants. But also found yeti&#39;s, spiders and <br/>
drolvarg&#39;s to be charmable. The key to this place is finding a relatively <br/>
quiet area. I had a couple of places I liked to use. 1 was just to the <br/>
south of the tunnel that leads to the druid/wizzie ports. Another was just <br/>
to the East of the same tunnel where there&#39;s a little shack that leads to <br/>
the yeti caves, a nice little plains area with lots of things walking <br/>
nearby. Lastly, I started pulling from the giant fort nearby. It usually <br/>
not camped and is nice to get away from all the hubbub of the Frontier Mtns.<br/>
<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen -- Mid 40&#39;s to 50. Here&#39;s my secret fishing hole. Well <br/>
it&#39;s not all that secret, but it&#39;s some of the best kiting exp I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
and it&#39;s helped take me from my 40&#39;s to 50. When I was around 42 I had <br/>
charm kited a pair of them and got an entire blue bubble of exp with each <br/>
kill. They are in the bottom of the lake, and are usually in pairs. I&#39;ve <br/>
had a fishbone earring at the time (singing steel gauntlets now) and with <br/>
my tambourine I could easily outswim the gobbies. I&#39;d chant 1, and usually <br/>
2 would come (chase view helps here). As I&#39;d pull them to the shore I&#39;d <br/>
continue hammering the one I pulled with 2 chants. When we got to shore, he <br/>
was usually down about 1/4 of a bubble. I&#39;d charm him and have him fight <br/>
his buddy. When he was low in life, I&#39;d charm his buddy to kill him. Then <br/>
I&#39;d fear-kite or chant-kite the other to death. Fear kiting was good to use <br/>
as it help keep up my combat skills. However, they can hit pretty hard so <br/>
be wary. BTW, I had one blue bubble to go to get to 50. I killed 4 of these <br/>
and dinged. The bloodgills have become more camped as time has gone on. <br/>
Obviously the word is out about them, but for us bards, it&#39;s one of the <br/>
easiest things to fight for us. Having enduring breath from a fishbone <br/>
earring was extremely helpful since I could just track down the goblin that <br/>
I wanted and pull.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now that I&#39;ve told you all about some of the places I hang out at, <br/>
I hope to see you around. Not sure how much further past 50 I&#39;ll go since <br/>
kiting doesn&#39;t sound all that attractive with mobs summoning. But you can <br/>
be assured that I&#39;ll be giving it a try. :-)<br/>
