<div id="ygrps-yiv-339110376">Hail all,<br/>
I&#39;m not new but this was a cool idea, the introduction question list so I <br/>
have to fill one out myself:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Welcome~&gt;&gt; Good to meet you - we all wanna know<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:&gt; what level you are : 23<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;do you party or solo: Party, party, party!<br/>
&gt;fav blue to kill: anything that doesn&#39;t get me first!<br/>
&gt;unfav place to die in:  Runnyeye<br/>
&gt;most number of deaths getting a corpse back: maybe 2, after that I go cry <br/>
&gt;on high level male barb warrior shoulders. got to love that female wood elf <br/>
&gt;bathing suit!<br/>
&gt;most number of levels with no death (if any :): never happen, our motto is <br/>
&gt;go strange places and die there  ;)<br/>
&gt;please also submit a suggestion for the term to describe&gt; playing two songs <br/>
&gt;at once (don&#39;t say &#39;twisting&#39; &lt;g&gt;): I love to harmonize<br/>
&gt;run out and buy a Dragoon Dirk: had one off the West commons dragoon<br/>
&gt;and tell us what in your &#39;bio&#39; screen when ppl inspect your equipment: A <br/>
&gt;bard by trade, I make my home in Freeport. When the wanderlust strikes I <br/>
&gt;can be found anywhere collecting stories and knowledge. (this is close, its <br/>
&gt;been awhile since I looked at it.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as binding goes, I always get a local bind or run like a rabbit from <br/>
trouble. Early in final I &#39;adpoted&#39; a rogue and he suddenly decided to join <br/>
the priesthood. So typically when you find me, there&#39;s a very nice high elf <br/>
cleric very close by. He binds for donations. :)<br/>
I rarely solo, its too dull compared to being in a group plus I am guilded <br/>
to Excalibur on Xegony, so I rarely lack for work or friends.<br/>
I suppose I am also a twink, having a high level paladin husband and many <br/>
higher level friends. What can I say when they say meet me in town and hand <br/>
me a rubicite bracer! It would be so rude to say No. My only defense is I <br/>
always pass along my old equipment to guildmates or friends in need. I do <br/>
not have any bronze plate however (its hideous on me) and only the 1 ruby <br/>
bracer. I have seen FAR worse twinks than myself.<br/>
