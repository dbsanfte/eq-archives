<div id="ygrps-yiv-175278920">This is an easy test, just apply a little scientific method.  I tried <br/>
     it with my enchanter friend.  She cast a one big sell (200 mana or <br/>
     such, enchant metal)and instantly sat, meditated and stood when she at <br/>
     full mana.  this way you are measuring the same exact amount of mana <br/>
     vrs time and can disregard refresh rate, etc.  There is a touch of <br/>
     variance based on the consistency of her reaction rate but this is <br/>
     probably small and she is very methodical.  Anyway Jig didn&#39;t do a <br/>
     thing with or without a drum.  Same time on my stopwatch to within 5 <br/>
     100ths of a second.  Boy was I disappointed....<br/>

My first reply to this was My God this man must not live, his head must be <br/>
jacked into the motherboard, then I thought, well its nice to get the truth, <br/>
it will be worth testing more to find out.<br/>
     <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;Did you get the same results?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Offhand, I would say that at 12th level, your meditation skill <br/>
&gt;is only 60 (65?), so it will be &quot;failing&quot; at a pretty <br/>
&gt;substantial rate (whatever it is that failure does).  So I <br/>
&gt;would expect some variability in your mana regeneration times <br/>
&gt;regardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting <br/>
&gt;unintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase <br/>
&gt;in regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation <br/>
&gt;means you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the <br/>
&gt;time for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I <br/>
&gt;still think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would <br/>
&gt;increase the regeneration rate because the success/fail check <br/>
&gt;would be made more frequently.  That would decrease <br/>
&gt;regeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at <br/>
&gt;later levels.<br/>
