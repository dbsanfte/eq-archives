<div id="ygrps-yiv-889518335">Well, I mosied on down to Lower guk, naked, following the excellent<br/>
instructions given.<br/>
Went down naked;)<br/>
Made it to the Tower allright, and to the assassin room. This is where the<br/>
MAnure hit the proverbial fan (sighs sadly).<br/>
I waited to look up the ladder until All the casting was done. I peeked my<br/>
head up to see what the room looked like, and dropped back down.<br/>
Not one second after I did this, some dark elf woman jumps down, and calls<br/>
me a Thief. Loot thief. every name in the bloody book..<br/>
all I said was &quot;eh?&quot;<br/>
and she went on to say She saw me on the ladder, then the corpse<br/>
dissappeared, then I &quot;ran&quot;<br/>
 I didnt run, I was at the bottom of the ladder, politely waiting for<br/>
someoen to say &quot;Carapace for loot, or Mask for loot&quot;<br/>
Supposedly, I &quot;Stole&quot; The mask, and now im going to be blacklisted, my name<br/>
will mean nothing, no one will trust me. she start screaming out loud over<br/>
shout, saying no one should trust me, that I am &quot;an (insert colorful verb<br/>
here) loot thief. No matter what I said to her, , or over Shout. no one<br/>
would listen to me.(Lynriss was her name. Fibtik, Wokka, arthon where in her<br/>
group as well)<br/>
I am, and forever will be, an honorable man. Truthful, and Honest.<br/>
I tell you now that I did not loot a mask=(<br/>
I am afraid that my name will be smeared all over the message boards, and on<br/>
the little black lists that some of the more anal people on my server<br/>
follow.(Mithaniel Marr)<br/>
I am asking you, as a friend. To please vouch for me, and defend me if you<br/>
hear or see anythign about me, as obviously, my word means nothing.<br/>
I do thank Rann for helping as much as he could. Thank you all<br/>

life</div>
