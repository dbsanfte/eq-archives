<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Dual wielding question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180675919">hehe i am having an off-hand weapon dilemma myself at the moment =)  here is<br/>
some basic info.  keep in mind there are a few weapons out there that are<br/>
either primary hand only or off-hand only, but most are not.<br/>
<br/>
1) obviously you want good damage/delay ratio weapons.  you want your higher<br/>
damage weapon in your off-hand and your lower delay weapon in your primary<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
2) yes you can duel wield any 1h weapons in either hand (piercing, slashing,<br/>
blunt).<br/>
<br/>
3) using two types of weapons helps build each skill.  as far as<br/>
effectiveness it does not matter, it is only based on how high your skill is<br/>
in that weapon.<br/>
<br/>
4) as far as what to use it&#39;s hard to say without knowing exactly what is in<br/>
your arsenal and the stats.<br/>
<br/>
good luck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 1) How do you determine what weapon to put in what hand?  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard to make sure they have different delays, and that <br/>
&gt; makes sense, but I&#39;m a bit baffled on the rest.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) Is it possible to dual wield weapons of different skills?  <br/>
&gt; i.e. a slashing and a blunt...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) Is it better to dual wield that way, if it&#39;s possible, or <br/>
&gt; to use the same kind of weapon?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4) Currently I have a Water Crystal staff, a Dragoon Dirk <br/>
&gt; (that sits in my range slot for the stats), someone&#39;s Poker <br/>
&gt; (can&#39;t remember the NPC name), and a SWA and a sword that a <br/>
&gt; higher level let me &quot;borrow&quot;, though I don&#39;t remember the <br/>
&gt; name of stats, so I guess I&#39;ll get back to you on that and <br/>
&gt; the poker.  Would these be good for dual wielding, or should <br/>
&gt; I look into getting something else?  Bear in mind, I&#39;m only <br/>
&gt; 15-17th level and NOT that rich anymore.  (Spent way too much <br/>
&gt; of it on armor for myself and friends.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anything you guys can suggest, advice, pass on will be <br/>
&gt; greatly appreciated.  Thanks a heap. *smiles*<br/>
