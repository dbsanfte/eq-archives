&gt; The songs only effects party members in the zone and has a 3 second casting<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pretty useless.  At level 45+, you almost always have access<br/>
to L49 ressurections which give ~80% of your exp back.  I<br/>
would rather just die there and have a cleric give me an exp<br/>
res, than chance having to waste a half hour of my time and<br/>
the group&#39;s time running/finding a ride back from some random<br/>
location.  One of the L51+ cleric spells is a 95% res, which<br/>
would make this song even more useless.  It would&#39;ve been a<br/>
nice song in the 20s and 30s.<br/>
<br/>
Verant has also been pretty adamant about keeping group<br/>
teleports the sole domain of wizards and druids.  The logical<br/>
&quot;other&quot; class to get teleport spells would&#39;ve been L51+<br/>
rangers, since they use druid spells.  But Verant already shot<br/>
that idea down.<br/>
