<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888277770">I ran our discussion the other day past a friend at, um, a Governmental<br/>
Office that pays a lot of attention to legal issues and is keenly aware the<br/>
Net is creating totally new issues. (Sorry, it&#39;s no biggy, I just couldn&#39;t<br/>
post what they said if I said which office)  Most of the codes currently<br/>
written involve regard &quot;knowingly accesses a computer, computer network, or<br/>
computer system without the effective consent of the owner&quot;, but on the<br/>
topic of online theft this was a quick reply, not at ALL an official<br/>
opinion, just one persons quick thoughts on the matter, I thought I would<br/>
send it along:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Theft&quot; under the penal code is specific to tangible and intangible personal<br/>
property.  Intangible personal property is specifically defined as something<br/>
like a certificate of deposit or stock shares.  Crimes against intellectual<br/>
property are like violation of copyright or theft of trade secrets.  Except<br/>
in the tax code, in which  &quot;intangible personal property&quot; means  &quot;a claim,<br/>
interest (other than an interest in tangible property), right, or other<br/>
thing that has value but cannot be seen, felt, weighed, measured, or<br/>
otherwi1se perceived by the senses, although its  existence may be evidenced<br/>
by a document.&quot;  It is really, really difficult to get damages for<br/>
Intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Really, really hard.  Really<br/>
outrageous stuff has been found not to meet the standard.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, once looooong ago, back in the days when you could find things in a<br/>
Search Engine search, I got an email asking me to define &quot;spam&quot;, I think my<br/>
definition at the time included things like what are going to be attached to<br/>
the bottom of this post :o) At any rate, these folks really makes sure to<br/>
keep smart about this kind of stuff, so who knows, maybe youse guys started<br/>
something with that discussion. :o) As for legal recourse against Wizard<br/>
Kill Stealers anytime soon, well, there is still Charm...<br/>
