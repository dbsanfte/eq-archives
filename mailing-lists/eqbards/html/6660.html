<div id="ygrps-yiv-323599733">A couple of things that might have been discussed before but I don&#39;t remember so<br/>
throwing it out again just in case.  <br/>
<br/>
In reference to the level 22 song, it doesn&#39;t remove negative spell effects cast<br/>
on you either when sung or with the lute equipped.  In my testings, I have tried<br/>
this by just clicking on the song button.  I get the static pulse message but<br/>
nothing else.  What I have not tried is targetting myself (hitting F1 key or<br/>
click on my name) and then hitting the song button.  Has anyone tried playing<br/>
this song with targetting themselves first?<br/>
<br/>
One other possibility.  Are we 100% certain that the song is supposed to remove<br/>
negative buffs from us?  What if the song removes positive buffs from a mob?<br/>
<br/>
As a last resort, we could always send a message to Geoffrey Zatkin and try to<br/>
get clarification from him for both songs.  <br/>
<br/>
Once again, if these possibilities have already been covered then my bad.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; i still haven&#39;t tried the level 40 song since it was fixed, keep forgetting.<br/>
&gt; i have heard that it is a single target dispel magic song, removing one icon<br/>
&gt; per tick.  perhaps the level 22 song is a preventative song, meaning you<br/>
&gt; must be playing it to avoid getting charmed, as opposed to playing it after<br/>
&gt; a group member is charmed.  maybe get two bards (one level 22+ the other<br/>
&gt; level 28+) and one other person together.  have the level 22+ bard and 3rd<br/>
&gt; person group, and have the level 28+ bard alone and try to charm both people<br/>
&gt; in the group while the 22+ bard sings level 22 disenchanting melody and see<br/>
&gt; if charm works.  i&#39;m either too lazy or more likely will forget to try this<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greeting fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that the Antimagic Song was an AOE <br/>
&gt; &gt; or party only <br/>
&gt; &gt; that prevented harmful spells from being cast on the party by <br/>
&gt; &gt; any attacking <br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs. I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Karanas Ogre <br/>
&gt; &gt; camp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song <br/>
&gt; &gt; to prevent <br/>
&gt; &gt; members from being charmed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I tried Disenchant last night after a group member was rez&#39;ed <br/>
&gt; &gt; and it did not <br/>
&gt; &gt; dispell the Rez effect. It was effecting my whole party but <br/>
&gt; &gt; no one reported <br/>
&gt; &gt; losing any buffs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it possible the Disenchanting song and the Antimagic song <br/>
&gt; &gt; effects have <br/>
&gt; &gt; been completely switched in the multitude of patches and <br/>
&gt; &gt; tweaks/nerfs since <br/>
&gt; &gt; beta?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondering out Loud,<br/>
