<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191616521">I know but then again us 50&#39;s played with less then you have now you guys<br/>
just want some new stuff I just need a place to hunt and I&#39;ve got a 21<br/>
shaman right now. There is plenty of places to hunt and there are quests<br/>
here and there but the bottom line is you guys can play  it&#39;s getting to be<br/>
unplayable now to wherem ost people don&#39;t pla ytheir main chars at all or<br/>
rarely rather because of overcrowding. This is the problem I am forced to<br/>
play my mid level chars so there must be something right for you guys.<br/>

&gt;I think we have covered all the bases in this thread.  I also think its one<br/>
&gt;of those threads where both sides of the argument are correct.  As a 50th<br/>
&gt;level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>
&gt;there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>
&gt;100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>
&gt;that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>
&gt;are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>
&gt;quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bottom line is that if EQ is gonna remain profitable over the next few<br/>
&gt;years, both areas need to be fixed.  Verant has stated that they have<br/>
&gt;multiple teams working on different areas (expansion, fixing current game,<br/>
&gt;etc).  It just seems to me that all improvements to the game are geared<br/>
&gt;toward keeping the 46+ players happy (i.e. all the teams really working on<br/>
&gt;the same thing) and not fixing the stuff broken in the current game.  IMO,<br/>
&gt;fixing whats broken in the current game and adding new content (quality<br/>
&gt;quests) is more appropriate for the long term health of the game.  Now the<br/>
&gt;counter argument is that if the level 50 players don&#39;t have something to<br/>

&gt;point in time, I think you just have to say its time to hang up the spurs<br/>
&gt;and move on.  Either you start another character or you move on to another<br/>
&gt;game.  Like Kitasi said in his post, the programmers will never be able to<br/>
&gt;keep up with the level 50 players.  The expansion will only be a short term<br/>
&gt;fix.  Assuming EQ2 is several years down the road, fixing the current game<br/>
&gt;(bugs) and adding new content (for everyone level 1-50) is the only viable<br/>
&gt;option from a business perspective IMO.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Actually I think Verant is missing the point there.  They will never be<br/>
&gt;&gt; able<br/>
&gt;&gt; to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>
&gt;&gt; ignore<br/>
&gt;&gt; the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>
&gt;&gt; game<br/>
&gt;&gt; far too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new<br/>
&gt;&gt; stuff.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>
&gt;&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>
&gt;&gt; bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>
&gt;&gt; good percentage of their customers.<br/>
