<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641057259">The wind instrument animation is the one that I know of....<br/>
Combine that with the<br/>
/dance<br/>
animation to do what you will.  I personally use a wind instrument<br/>
rather than the /Dance when required (Like the naked spawn dance to make<br/>
the monsters appear...  Don&#39;t ask  &gt;Grin&lt; )<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to this mailing list and have only recently<br/>
&gt; started to play a bard after my characters made it to<br/>
&gt; level 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started a newbie bard because I can remeber one day<br/>
&gt; while hunting SG&#39;s in Oasis - I saw a bard defeat a SG<br/>
&gt; without the SG laying a hand on him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This intrigued me as my 50 Ranger has to tank, kite<br/>
&gt; and use a lot of brain power to take down an SG and it<br/>
&gt; takes well over 10 minutes to kill one solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well - I do digress ( bard character is affecting me<br/>
&gt; already ) the question I wanted to ask was - DO WE<br/>
&gt; DANCE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many people come up to me and ask me to dance because<br/>
&gt; they can see I am a bard ( flashing lights etc. ) I<br/>
&gt; then do a kind of dance that involves walking<br/>
&gt; backwards ( moonwalking type thing ) coupled with a<br/>
&gt; few other moves. But I really doubt if this is Bard<br/>
&gt; Dancing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have seen the anim of the Male bard that looks kind<br/>
&gt; of like a Pied Piper jumping on eggs when the male<br/>
&gt; bard plays the flute. I can only assume this is the<br/>
&gt; dancing that people are talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we have another DANCE anim ?<br/>
