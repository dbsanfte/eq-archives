<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867987837"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Some things, especially the dread wolves and enraged dread wolves, do NOT<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they have this fixed as of the last patch.  I was in Kith last nite<br/>
(Real time) and was targeting an Enraged Dread Wolf to /con it for just this<br/>
reason.  While I had it targeted it despawned.  This was at 6AM KFT<br/>
(Kithicor Forest Time).  I ran all over the zone to see if there was<br/>
anything dangerous running around.  I did get jumped by a ghoul and nearly<br/>
had heart failure when it rooted me.  Fortunately it was one of the ordinary<br/>
ghouls that have always spawned near burned out houses in Kithicor.  I did<br/>
not run into anything during the day that wasn&#39;t around before this change.<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t have track yet so that info isn&#39;t 100% for sure but I did<br/>
stay in Kithicor ranging about until 6pm KFT so I covered a lot of ground.<br/>
