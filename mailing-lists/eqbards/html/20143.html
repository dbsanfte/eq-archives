<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444484618">Why do your shaman keep dying? Probably because the other people in your<br/>
group are not doing what they should to keep you alive ;-)  Heck, anyone can<br/>
play their own class properly and still die often if the rest of the people<br/>
in the group are not playing their classes properly.<br/>

Was wondering about the shaman :P<br/>
Yeah shaman are in a similar role after level 50ish.. almost always<br/>
defensive<br/>
yet for the life of me you can&#39;t get some shaman to stop dotting and<br/>
meleeing<br/>
its insane cuz the non-efficient dot takes 7 ticks and the efficient one 2<br/>
mins..  in full groups they are such a waste of mana its unbelievable...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, yeah yeah if i am such a good shaman how come i keep dying :(</div>
