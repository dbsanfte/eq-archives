After one day on the list, I managed to solve all my problems<br/>
<br/>
I am now at only 82/94 weight, because I got rid of my minotaur axe and got<br/>
a Dwarven 1H axe, and a Dragoon dirk.  I got myself a Purity Belt as well.<br/>
I also bought a bunch of songs that I originally thought weren&#39;t very useful<br/>
but find incredibly useful now.<br/>
I started &quot;juggling&quot; (I only use this term because its the first one I have<br/>
heard describing the method) Jonathan&#39;s whistling warsong with Chant of<br/>
Battle and I am hitting with almost only 1 second delay between strikes. I<br/>
only use Bellow&#39;s for Fetching now because at my level most things are<br/>
resisting it, and I would rather be going with the ultra fast attack speed.<br/>
what I found as I was auctioning my brains out is the following:<br/>
Bloodstained mantles go for about 70plat (this was in Kelethin) on average,<br/>
no one has heard of a troll Hide belt that I had met, and the Dragoon Dirk<br/>
does not always appear on Dvinn, so it has jumped about 20plat in price  I<br/>
got mine for 35plat, inside crushbone.  The Dwarven 1H axe is still pretty<br/>
cheap  I bought mine for 10plat and trading my minotaur axe.  Golden Amber<br/>
earrings go for 45pp still, and I got my Purity Belt for 15plat (in Beholder<br/>
Maze of all places)<br/>
One thing I have found about Medium Bronze:  It is much rarer than Small<br/>
Bronze armor and will go for around triple the cost.  and because of that  I<br/>
have found buying and then reselling my Bronze armor to desperate persons<br/>
can be one of the best money making experiences around.  I had originally<br/>
bought my Breastplate for 38pp, a person in Qeynos then offered me a<br/>
plethora of items for it until I settled on 88plat I sold it, and 5 minutes<br/>
later bought a Bronze breastplate, for 40plat and a bronze helm and pair of<br/>
bracers for 55plat, from a level 39 Bard named Gohan )<br/>
<br/>
But after buying all those things at the top of my post I am dead broke, and<br/>
looking for a good place to hunt. I tried looking in Lesser Faydark, and<br/>
after a half hour of running around all I saw was a small bandit camp, and a<br/>
Brownie camp (which I gave a very large detour around).  I am fighting in<br/>
the Oasis right now, but the Loot is pretty poor, and can be very dangerous<br/>
because of the Sand Giants running around.  Anyone have a good place for a<br/>
level 14 bard, that has reasonable loot and is not overcrowded??<br/>
