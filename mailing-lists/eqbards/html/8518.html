		For me at least.  One day I was really bored and decided to<br/>
do the Shining<br/>
		Star of Light quest.  Sure its Cleric/Paladin only, but what<br/>
they heck I<br/>
<br/>
		But lo and behold she said she would trade!  We met in the<br/>
W. Commonland<br/>
		Druid ring and traded.  I equipped it, and ZOOOOM!!!!! Off I<br/>
went, wow, I am<br/>
		still amazed at the speed.  At 13 I can outrun people in<br/>
JBOOTS, and have<br/>
		outrun people with SOW.  Its absolutely amazing how much<br/>
ground I can get.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, thats my tale.. hope it was entertaining.</div>
