<div id="ygrps-yiv-709859774">Guess what?  We still couldn&#39;t, no arrows.  Yes I was enjoying role-playing<br/>
running around with my bow which I will now destroy.  So why are there<br/>
two-handed weapons available since release that are bard equippable?  How<br/>
about instruments that are All/All.  If this is a &#39;bug fix&#39;, it&#39;s a stupid<br/>
one.  Fixing this bug had exactly one effect, a bard could no longer run<br/>
around with a bow in his hand.  Had there been arrows there would have been<br/>
exactly two effects, you could no longer role-play with your ranger buddies<br/>
asking what good this silly bow thing was and could they show you how to use<br/>
it right.  A perfect example of removing something that only added fun to<br/>
the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>heh, this is hardly a blow to roleplaying.  it&#39;s called &#39;&#39;bug fix&#39;&#39;.  bards<br/>
are not supposed<br/>
to be able to use bows, but someone made an error when typing this item into<br/>
the<br/>
database.  it is now fixed.  bards should have never been able to wield it.<br/>
effect to<br/>
roleplaying is nil.<br/>
