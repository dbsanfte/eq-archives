&gt; &gt; Also, though, what might be affecting you is that they can see through<br/>
&gt; &gt; illusion to your religion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you are agnostic or worship Bristlebane, have never killed a <br/>
&gt;   dark elf in your life, you can stroll around Neriak without <br/>
&gt;   any problems under Illusion: DE.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Bristlebane is probably the most reasonable choice of religion <br/>
&gt;   for most bards as far as ingame roleplaying goes as far as Verant<br/>
&gt;   is concerned:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &quot;Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense of<br/>
&gt;    nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies are all<br/>
&gt;    typical followers. They are almost always very charming, clever, and<br/>
&gt;    witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have.<br/>
&gt;    Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed<br/>
&gt;    as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane&#39;s<br/>
&gt;    followers are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep<br/>
&gt;    at least one eye on your purse if they are about. And never let one<br/>
&gt;    deal you a hand of King&#39;s Court.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As this sounded really fun, mischief == rogue to me.  And while bards<br/>
&gt;   are highly related to rogues in a skill sense, I never saw the bard<br/>
&gt;   as a mischief-maker, or wrong-doer.  Despite the &#39;not outright wicked&#39;<br/>
&gt;   comment, it still didn&#39;t sway me enough to pick a thief as a god.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This to me made me think wandering bard:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &quot;Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the<br/>
&gt;    winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength<br/>
&gt;    and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work for they<br/>
&gt;    know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is<br/>
&gt;    not consumed in an eternal tempest.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thus, I follow Karana.  While I cannot enter Neriak for convenience <br/>
&gt;   purposes under the guise, I wasn&#39;t going to regret the decision I<br/>
&gt;   made based on where I could/couldnt bank.<br/>
