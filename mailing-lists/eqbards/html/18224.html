<div id="ygrps-yiv-664351652">i was in kunark doing those giants as well last night. I had my necro, was<br/>
with a 51 paladin and a 42 shaman. we were holding the fort just the 3 of<br/>
us, and even pulling from the outside, we had a great time, i even got about<br/>
a quarter of a bub of xp (woo hehe)<br/>
<br/>
it was a slaughter, made plenty of cash, pet got some nice junk armor and we<br/>
got some nice items too<br/>
<br/>
some of those foreman tunics (blah)<br/>
a 10 ac belt all/all<br/>
lumberjack cap 10ac 3 stam<br/>
forest loop earing 2ac 3 dex/agi/wis (not lore so expect these to be wanted<br/>
by clerics/druids)<br/>
3 10ac/+7str rings (one each and they&#39;re lore)<br/>
<br/>
plus some junk weapons. Was fun, was always about 60 to 80 mana so no danger<br/>
at all to hunt em. <br/>
<br/>
I love the loot system in kunark, its random, so you dont see everyone<br/>
jumping the same kind of giant. most of the rings dropped on braes and crags<br/>
<br/>
Rakka / Minkin<br/>
Sol Ro<br/>
<br/>
*wonders if he can trade the ring for an SMR hehe*<br/>

&gt; The giants also drop some funny weapons like a giant axe that is 45 dam,<br/>
&gt; 150 delay, Orge, Bard, Troll<br/>
&gt; warrior only or a sword dam 10 del 42 I believe.  The Brae giants are<br/>
&gt; green at 45 up to the Patriarchs<br/>
&gt; and Steaps (sp?) which are blue at 51.  The Brae are pretty easy and make<br/>
&gt; up the bulk of the giants while<br/>
&gt; the Patriarchs hit DARN hard and really takes a good party to take out (we<br/>
&gt; had 2 warriors levels 51 and<br/>
&gt; 46, a 51 shaman with the new slow spell  which works AWESOME, a 45 druid,<br/>
&gt; a 42 rogue and me and we still<br/>
&gt; had both warriors under 2 bubbles of health when we got the AC25 tunic).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course the REAL good stuff drops on the Pats, but the steaps and brae<br/>
&gt; drop the weapons and tunics that<br/>
&gt; you would want to sell to the vendors.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe, I had gone back to look at the stats last night so I have them<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.  You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just<br/>
&gt; &gt; about EVERY class and race except<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like<br/>
&gt; &gt; leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all<br/>
&gt; &gt; protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; I believe.  The key though is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both<br/>
&gt; &gt; human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
