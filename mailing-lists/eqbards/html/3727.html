&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my views here (still off topic, but all us Bards seem to dabble in<br/>
&gt;trade skills anyway):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>
&gt;enough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>
&gt;work on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>
&gt;good then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You got some poor advice.  There is no magical road to money in trade<br/>
skills.  There are a few trade skills where you can make a profit, but<br/>
normally require hundreds of plat and many hours to build up your skill<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
[trade skill failures clipped]<br/>
<br/>
Forget trade skills.  You are never going to get rich there.  You need to<br/>
kill mobs with decent loot.  The two legged mobs almost always have better<br/>
loot than the four legged ones.  Two great areas for your level are<br/>
Blackburrow and Crushbone.  Since you are in Freeport, you might not want to<br/>
travel that far.  Instead there is Befallen and all the Derv camps in WC,<br/>
North and South Ro.  You will get rusty weapons, and pieces of armor,<br/>
sometimes even a bronze weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Collect every single thing from the corpses to sell.  You may want to invest<br/>
in some backpacks.  Once you are way overloaded, sell everything.  It is<br/>
important to find a merchant that will give you a good price.  With Selos,<br/>
you can run a bit farther for better prices.<br/>
<br/>
After an hour or so, you will will have your bp&#39;s full of junk.  It will all<br/>
sell for about 1-3gp.  But if you have 20 items, that can come out to 3-6pp.<br/>
Sometimes you will get lucky and find a bronze weapon that sells for 1-3pp.<br/>
Play for 3-4 hours and you can earn near 20pp.<br/>

&gt;handouts from higher level folks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How can you possibly believe that?  My bard never got a handout.  At level<br/>
13 I have full banded, a Combine LS, and 10pp in the bank.  For all of us<br/>
who started from day one, we had no one to give us handouts.  Don&#39;t insult<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>
&gt;get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>
&gt;it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume that you did waste some of your money learning all the trade<br/>
skills.  That is a hole you will have to work out of.  But with hard work,<br/>
you can overcome this.  Just concentrate on getting one piece of banded at a<br/>
time.<br/>
