<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-745602871">Hola , <br/>
	My question is , whats the deal on a demon&#39;s claw ? I saw it on a <br/>
high level warrior and he said that it was 1h slash - 5 dam 20 del . is this <br/>
true? if so how much does it cost? He said you got it in ogguk or something , <br/>
what lvl is that zone , and what creatures does it come off of . ( if its a <br/>
demon don&#39;t think i&#39;m stupid , i&#39;ve never been there) <br/>
	Another question i have is , So polished granite tomahawk doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be worth it as i read these posts , so what do i get . i have 2 <br/>
combine long swords w/ like 50pp in the bank , what should i get ? I&#39;m the <br/>
type of person that would save up for the best possible weapon just because i <br/>
get sick of thinking about what to buy next and trying to save for it <br/>
...constantly.<br/>
Ok any and all info is appreciated !<br/>
