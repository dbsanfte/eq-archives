<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070660086">Hmm, interesting. As a human with a charisma of 90 I can buy a steel<br/>
breastplate in freeport for 700-something plat. I havent checked the prices<br/>
recently though, they may have changed it since for some reason. I&#39;ll check up<br/>
on this and see.<br/>
May I ask where you purchased it and what race you are?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I recently purchased a steel breastplate.  It was 980 or so platinum at 90<br/>
&gt; charisma.  Putting on my two +5 charisma items reduced the price by around<br/>
&gt; 40 plat.  I then got a friendly shaman to cast a charisma buff on me,<br/>
&gt; bringing my total up to 115; this brought the price down to less than 900<br/>
&gt; platinum.  Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the exact figures.<br/>
