<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957400533">i know this is going on a tangent, but it sorta just proves that sow/ wolf<br/>
form is better for killing stuff then relying on speed song, speed song is<br/>
truly last resort to use.  here&#39;s my last night&#39;s proof of this.  charm is<br/>
also good for saving friends.<br/>
<br/>
last night we were killing giants, me, a druid and a monk, all in wolf form<br/>
(shared wolf form is great, not only does it give sow but also raises your<br/>
attack by about 70 points!!).  Anyways, we were really disorganized on one<br/>
of our last pulls and everyone almost died.  This giant had a really high<br/>
resist rate to the druid (level 39)  and to me (level 30).    it kept<br/>
resisting his snare and a few times his spells, and eventually to get it off<br/>
him we got it on us. we dished out a fare amount of damage but me and the<br/>
monk almost died, had to retreat a few times with guitar in hand playing<br/>
heal.  and at one point it went really ballistic on the monk, the monk<br/>
couldnt feign death successfully against it and was down to half a bubble of<br/>
health and i was fairly far away.  I ran towards him right away and tried a<br/>
charm just incase i succeeded.  Well with him at less then half a bubble of<br/>
health, i charmed it and then pulled it away from him while the druid medded<br/>
up while i would kite it around while healing.  We then finished it off and<br/>
about 2 minutes after our wolf form wore off.    Needless to say everyone<br/>
was really releived when it died.  Then while healing the monk says he&#39;s<br/>
happy his feign death worked, i told him it didnt work, i just missed having<br/>
a pocket giant as a pet.  Charm is a great way to fight kill stealers and<br/>
also a great way to save party members as monsters really really hate you<br/>
after you use it. (last charmed giant before this got me killled).<br/>

&gt; &gt; and a mage totally lagged last night.  I know in truth that Selo&#39;s is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful tool, but I have also learned that SOW can be a good send for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rest of your party.  When running you will have to keep close tabs<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; all of the party members because it is eay to lose them.  So it is a<br/>
&gt; toss<br/>
&gt; &gt; and will depend on the situation.  BTW you are correct about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; unrooting, but it will become a moot point once you start camping a room<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the group has SoW available, I usually go with it.<br/>
&gt; Retreats are rarely organized and people tend to break off at<br/>
&gt; different times.  If everyone is SoW&#39;ed, I don&#39;t have to wait<br/>
&gt; around for everyone else to leave first, so I am at less risk.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m finding this to be more important now that I can&#39;t tank as<br/>
&gt; well as the other true tanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will still keep Accelerando memorized and the drum ready<br/>
&gt; though.  The obvious use is for unrooting people.  But another<br/>
&gt; use is that SoW walking is barely faster than monsters.<br/>
&gt; Accelerando with a drum while walking is significantly faster.<br/>
&gt; So if any of your party is down to a bubble or less and is<br/>
&gt; walking, you can use Accelerando with a drum to give him<br/>
&gt; enough speed to escape without getting hit from behind 3-4<br/>
&gt; times.<br/>
