<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-920632550">Hello, I am writing to comment on the way that Verant has made each<br/>
of the dragons tougher to fight now. On Thursday mornings patch, Verant gave<br/>
Nag and Vox a new ability to AE Dispel Magic. I am a Level 50 Bard by the<br/>
name of Downs on Tribunal, my guild The Elitists and our Sister guild The<br/>
Vagrants attempted to kill both dragons after the patch. Well, Lady Vox fell<br/>
fine but after a failed attempt at Lord Nag we had some key members in need<br/>
of sleep due to it being a weekday (yes, we got started a little late in the<br/>
evening). <br/>
<br/>
	I was just commenting on this fact so that others know what to<br/>
expect now when fighting these dragons, most everyone in our raiding party<br/>
had all of their buffs stripped away. I also noticed that guardian rhythms<br/>
and elemental rhythms was being stripped by Nag and Vix nearly as fast as I<br/>
could refresh them. It is seems these two are quite a bit more difficult<br/>
now.<br/>
