<div id="ygrps-yiv-104272427">heh, and to think all this started from one post stating dissaproval<br/>
of a guild...  <br/>
<br/>
I meant no dissrespect to the Bardic guild in question. What they are<br/>
trying to do is take roleplaying to one more level which is quite<br/>
admirable in my belief. But that is all it is, a belief. Again I<br/>
apologize for sounding brash in any way, my mouth tends to get me into<br/>
trouble anyway. (Most Orcs don&#39;t like being reminded of their large<br/>
rear ends...)<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I had hoped this mailing list wouldn&#39;t turn into a debate<br/>
between us, for we should use this opportunity to help each other in<br/>
the difficult world of a Norrath community. Not to slander each other.<br/>
Perhaps my meaning was misunderstood before I had scrybed it down. I<br/>
again apologize. <br/>
<br/>
I also hope this can end our debate so that we can focus our attention<br/>
to matters of bardic excellence.<br/>
