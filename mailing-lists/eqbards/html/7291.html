<div id="ygrps-yiv-799069071">It is pretty easy to tell whether Selo Accelarado breaks the root or the <br/>
root just wore off by itself.  If Selo breaks the root, the ROOT Icon will <br/>
still remain for the duration even when you are freely moving around.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Selo Accelarado breaks root or not, but I am sure Selo Chain <br/>
breaks root.  Again, the Root Icon remains for 15 to 20 second even after I <br/>
was moving around freely.  And I don&#39;t think it has to do with the level of <br/>
the person who rooted you.  I was lv 47 at the time and the wizard who <br/>
rooted me was lv 49.  I was about to break it with Selo Chain.  We were <br/>
indoor so I couldn&#39;t test Accelerado.<br/>

&gt;people thought they &quot;broke&quot; it - it simply wore off at the same time.<br/>
