The other thing is that weapons are rated compared to your ability to use<br/>
them.  If you use a weapon that is better than you are then you are unable<br/>
to use it to its maximum potentional.  If it is way above you, you can<br/>
actually damage the weapon by using it, probably since you would be<br/>
incapable of using it correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Nice twist on anti-twinking.<br/>
<br/>
Looting is different.  When the MOB dies it drops stuff on the ground, you<br/>
need to select it and get it.  Your loot is your loot, no one else can pick<br/>
it up.  On the downside, if someone doesn&#39;t want the loot and leaves it<br/>
there, you cannot ever take it.  I do beleive it is theirs until it<br/>
disappears.<br/>

&gt; I had the opportunity to Beta test DAoC.  I was impressed.<br/>
&gt; A lot of unique things in DAoC that you don&#39;t see in EQ but might wish you<br/>
did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few examples:<br/>
&gt; 1.)  Equipment and Armor degrades as you use it.  If it degrades far<br/>
enough<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have to run to town and get it &quot;refreshed&quot; to keep the stats up.<br/>
&gt; 2.)  Any player can bind him/herself to any city/town/village bind point.<br/>
&gt; Commmand:  /bind<br/>
&gt; 3.)  Seems to be a lot more low and midlevel quests for experience.  Every<br/>
visit<br/>
&gt; to &quot;guild master&quot; presents a new quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started many characters in each of the realms to &quot;try&quot; them out, didn&#39;t<br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; level many of them up very far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all that comes to mind at the moment.  If you&#39;re playing feel free<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; elaborate.<br/>
&gt; Still need to run out and get my copy of DAoC, Beta is over and I&#39;m cut<br/>
off at<br/>
&gt; the moment.<br/>
