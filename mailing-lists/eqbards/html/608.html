couple occasions without incident.  (Then again, the bandits<br/>
in Butcherblock now /con threatening, but attack on sight.)<br/>

On what server do you need Kelin&#39;s Lament?  I&#39;m on Karana and<br/>
was planning to make the trip from Kelethin to Qeynos some<br/>
time this week.  I could buy a couple extra copies and sell<br/>
them there.<br/>
