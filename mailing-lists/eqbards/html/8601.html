<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944687177">Aha, so now I&#39;ve found someone on my server who admits being in one of<br/>
those very frequent trains ;-)  You don&#39;t know Dreammer by any chance?<br/>
He seems legendary in starting trains!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still a way off the area as my bard, but my wiz has been hanging<br/>
around there for a while, never been lucky when the group finds decent<br/>
loot and lottos it, but she has now got a sacrificial dagger donated<br/>
kindly by the ranger who desperately wants to get in her underwear!!<br/>
<br/>
I think as soon as my bard gets up the levels, she needs to make the<br/>
trip across to start the merciless bad elf hunt.  The philistines<br/>
clearly don&#39;t like good music!!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dunno your level or type of group you play with, but you are in error (not a<br/>
&gt;direct personal attack, maybe just misinformed). A friend of mine (Druid 50)<br/>
&gt;and myself (Warrior 45) are able to clear out the Princess, Butler, Maid,<br/>
&gt;Vampire, and gypsy (late, cant think of the exact names) spots in about 15<br/>
&gt;mins. Only had to evac once and that was due to someone having a look see,<br/>
&gt;and not conning the will sappers who see through invis. Pulled quite an<br/>
&gt;impressive train, and hope he could appreciate how big it was. Maybe take<br/>
&gt;some comfort his death impressed others =)<br/>
&gt;As to bards in there, way back when a lot of us were around 35 we took a<br/>
&gt;party in there containing two bards, a cleric, druid, warrior and necro. No<br/>
&gt;one died, and it was great fun playing around inside the castle. Just take a<br/>
&gt;group of people that you trust not to dork out on you, and that you have<br/>
&gt;played together a lot, and you will do fine.<br/>
&gt;Do it at the lower levels, cause once you hit 45 plus, place turns into<br/>
&gt;green hell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have fun out there<br/>
