And yes, the Patch message really is just an advertisement.  <br/>
I&#39;ll say it again WTG Gordo!<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m the grumpy dwarf who always put his foot in<br/>
his mouth and should learn restraint, but....<br/>
<br/>
AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Buncha idiots.  Freaking morons.  The whole lot of<br/>
them are tiny peckered losers who cannot get  grip on<br/>
their weiners and take out their sexual frustrations<br/>
on the customers to help them feel more superior so<br/>
they can sit back in dreams of delusional granduer and<br/>
see themselves as having power in the world as they<br/>
sit in a large circle and flog themselves over<br/>
pictures of Alanis Morriset and sniff glue from a<br/>
paper bag while listing to the CD player as it blares<br/>
out &quot;Girl you know it&#39;s true&quot; from Milli Vanilli over<br/>
and over.<br/>
<br/>
GOD VERANT SUCKS!!<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t one of Abashi&#39;s stated job roles to make the<br/>
patch messages more informative than they ever were<br/>
before?  Yeah, great job you&#39;re doing there Gordo. <br/>
This guy is a complete idiot who is so involved with<br/>
how important he is these days that he does not even<br/>
communicate which is what he was hired to do.  Many I<br/>
want a job where I can post about 20 messages a day on<br/>
a BB and call it a day&#39;s work.  Sheesh this sucks.<br/>
<br/>
And that producer&#39;s letter?  Updates every week or<br/>
two?  HA!  Except for the new rules posted it had not<br/>
been updated since December.<br/>
<br/>
AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
****BOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Ofbac&#39;s head explodes, sending dwarf chunks into every<br/>
corner of the tavern.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa the barkeep says &#39;Looks like that will take<br/>
more than a heal or a res to fix.&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
Melissa the barkeep says &#39;Oh hello Findle.  Say, have<br/>
you seen the splintered club that I just got in? <br/>
Looks like you could use one.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Findle: &#39;No!  I do not want a splintered club!  I&#39;m a<br/>
50th level enchanter!  What could I possible want with<br/>
a splintered club?  Stop asking me that!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Melissa the barkeep says &#39;Sorry to have disturbed you.<br/>
 Please come again soon&#39;<br/>

A guide appears out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Apprentice_Guide_07 sayd &#39;Findle, you have not shared<br/>
this spawn and killed it yourself before asking if<br/>
anyone else in the entire server wanted to kill it<br/>
first.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to ban you now.&#39;<br/>

&gt; &gt; So in otherwords- figure it out yourself. <br/>
&gt; Probably reduced the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trumpy tonic quest exp (or fixed level ranges). <br/>
&gt; Hope they fixed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aegis of Life, Helm of Ro quest, and a couple of<br/>
&gt; other quests that<br/>
&gt; &gt; took wekks to complete, but that would probably be<br/>
&gt; asking too<br/>
&gt; &gt; much.....<br/>
