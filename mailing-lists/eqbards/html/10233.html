<div id="ygrps-yiv-312447021"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How much of a slowdown did the shaman spell have?  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; watching for this when an enchanter friend cast a slowdown on<br/>
&gt; a mob we were fighting.  Her spell was a much greater slowdown<br/>
&gt; than Chain would&#39;ve caused, and based on my eyeball<br/>
&gt; observations (combat was too hectic to use a stopwatch) Chain<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t override the spell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Incredible slowdown effect.  I mean to the tune of hundreds<br/>
   of percent slower.  I&#39;d say an ice giant normally would double<br/>
   attack every 2 secs or so.  With L49 drowsy, the ice giant would<br/>
   only swing every 6-8 secs.  It&#39;s that much of a slowdown.  But<br/>
   as soon as I chained it, it started wailing on me again fast.<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.</div>
