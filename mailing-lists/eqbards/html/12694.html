&gt; &gt; is that so hard to believe, that 225 would make a difference where 125 does<br/>
&gt; &gt; not?  or did i read that wrong.  you&#39;re killing me, Harm!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Sure it would.  If 125 doesnt do anything, but 225 does?<br/>
&gt;   I dunno, Vox was standing right on top of me almost, and with my<br/>
&gt;   crappy cold resistance, I absorbed at least 300% of the dmg.  <br/>
&gt;   Instead of taking 600ish like I could tell my party members did,<br/>
&gt;   I ate less than 200.  Plus her DragonRoar didn&#39;t do jack to me.<br/>
&gt;   I just stood there, heh.  I had no buffs on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have heard that the dragon&#39;s breath AoE is directional.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way, I was in the sllooooowww group that did Nagafen.  Every day and<br/>
every time we learn though =).<br/>
<br/>
Also, my experience with resists:  I am playing elemental and guardian with drum.  A<br/>
fear gets through (lucky roll for Naggy?) and my songs drop while I am feared.  The<br/>
very next dragon breath does full and significant damage when before, with songs up<br/>
at almost the same relative position to Nag, I took far less damage.<br/>
