<div id="ygrps-yiv-660686891">&quot;I think it&#39;s a female ogre warrior. He was working on a wood elf warrior<br/>
(no<br/>
clue why that race/class combo&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same reason I have a Gnome Warrior.  To be different.  Wouldn&#39;t it be great<br/>
if every warrior, and every other class for that matter, were all the same<br/>
race?  My Gnome Warrior does fine has 179 str self buffed 1030+AC 1000+ atk<br/>
and in my opinion the difference in performance is negligible.  Plus there<br/>
is nothing like tanking that HUGE giant or even one of those Tree&#39;s in PoG.<br/>
Or the ultimate satisfaction is when some snot nosed Ogre/Troll/Barbarian<br/>
starts talking trash about how much a Gnome Warrior must suck only to<br/>
receive thier beat down and humiliation of losing to a Gnome of all things,<br/>
I love it.<br/>

Well, you did say quests - but i thought i would just toss this out....<br/>
<br/>
A 60 cleric (in my guild) using 3 PC&#39;s & 4 char&#39;s (clr, sha, ench & war)<br/>
PL&#39;d his war to 60 in 7 days /played.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a female oger warrior. He was working on a wood elf warrior (no<br/>
clue why that race/class combo) then scrapped it - told us to sac him down<br/>
from 53 (i think) when he decided to restart.<br/>
<br/>
PL&#39;ing melee classes typically invovles enough melee (imagine that) so that<br/>
you don&#39;t really fall to far behind on melee skills (offense, defense, 1HS,<br/>
1HB, etc.) if at all.  Caster classes on the other hand..... well, when we<br/>
see ppl practice casting spells on them selves or what not to buld skill -<br/>
we call it &quot;magerbating&quot; ;)<br/>

Gah - if I can ever teach one thing to new players, it&#39;s this:<br/>
<br/>
NEVER EVER POWER-LEVEL ON QUESTS ALONE.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be worth a darned at all, it is very important that you <br/>
practice ALL of your skills from day one.<br/>
