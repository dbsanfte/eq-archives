<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551782090">I would love to see that list of spawn times if you get the chance.<br/>
<br/>
I often share the duty of puller/timekeeper for my groups and it would be<br/>
quite helpful.<br/>
<br/>
In so far as what I&#39;ve learned...<br/>
<br/>
19.5 min is the time for Najena, Permafrost and Sol A. That is the time from<br/>
the death of the previous mob to the spawn of the new mob. Usually I round<br/>
off to 20 min because it usually takes us at least 30 seconds for the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Abashi has stated on the boards that spawn times are directly related to<br/>
processor load on the machine that is serving the zone. Therefore, if a zone<br/>
gets very crowded, expect to see time between spawns increase. Also, it is<br/>
my belief that the bigger zones have a longer spawn time (since there are<br/>
more things to keep track of in the zone) therefore, spawn times in L Guk,<br/>
Sol B and West Karana should be longer than other zones such as Blackburrow<br/>
or Najena. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were a spawn time / level<br/>
of mob ratio that exists.<br/>

All I know is that when I am camping something in Lower Guk, I have three<br/>
count down timers sitting on my desk timing seperate spawns.  When one of<br/>
them beeps, I notifiy the party that spawn is about to happen and in every<br/>
single case that I can remember, I&#39;ve been dead on accurate (within 30<br/>
seconds or so).  When we started camping the Assassion/Supplier that<br/>
morning, we had a small debate whether it was 32 or 34 minutes and over the<br/>
next 8 hours or so EVERY single spawn was almost exactly 34 minutes after<br/>
the &quot;death&quot; of its placeholder/predecessor.  When I camped the Lord, he and<br/>
his guards also had exactly a 34 minute spawn time from the death of the<br/>
last one.  I camped the King&#39;s room in Sol A a couple of months ago for 9<br/>
hours (I was there for XP and we ended up decaying about 6 Rings of the<br/>
Goblin Lords :( ) and not once during that period did the expected spawn not<br/>
show up exactly 20 minutes after its predecessor was dispatched.<br/>
<br/>
Because I like to do it, I&#39;m almost always the time keeper whenever I&#39;m in a<br/>
group camping something and so far I observed Guk/Sol B are almost always 34<br/>
minutes, Sol A is almost always exactly 20 minutes and I have a whole<br/>
listing of spawn times for other camps at home...  The only time I&#39;ve seen<br/>
these spawn times messed up is in Sol A camping the EXG... he sometimes<br/>
seems to skip a spawn cycle or 2 with no placeholder and... and in<br/>
situations where the server (not network) is very laggy.  On bad server days<br/>
you can throw the clocked spawn times out the window.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s Prexus and we just are super consistant, but for the most part<br/>
the timings are right on.<br/>

&gt; &gt; and or nada loots from the named.  Something is on the 34 min cycle but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wont always be the Assassin with a mask or dirk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Regarding the spawn time cycle.  It&#39;s as close to a fixed time as<br/>
&gt;   possible, but you all stating that it&#39;s 34 mins misleads a lot of<br/>
&gt;   people.  It&#39;s not 34 mins, it&#39;s whenever each object in the zone<br/>
&gt;   has it&#39;s reset() called.  Verant uses an LPmud code variation for<br/>
&gt;   their object control, and as I have invested several years into<br/>
&gt;   development of the source of this mud, I can attest to the un-<br/>
&gt;   predictability of timing resets.  It all depends on how much is<br/>
&gt;   going on in the zone, and what the load on the server supplying<br/>
&gt;   the zone is.  I&#39;ve seen 30 min spawns in Guk, I&#39;ve also seen 55<br/>
&gt;   min spawns in Guk.  It depends on how many players are there, how<br/>
&gt;   many objects are in the zone, and how many NPCs need resetting<br/>
&gt;   each cycle.  I&#39;m sure other factors are involved.  This applies<br/>
&gt;   to every zone as well.  It looks like Verant sets a time for each<br/>
&gt;   object to reset, but according to how much needs to be done - your<br/>
&gt;   camped NPC may be the last thing to get reset, hence giving you<br/>
&gt;   the impression of a variable (or longer) spawn time.  IIRC, Guk<br/>
&gt;   is just like most other zones with a 25/30 min reset.  Due to the<br/>
&gt;   activity of the zone, you could see noticable delay in spawn resets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Anyway, just adding my knowledge =)<br/>
