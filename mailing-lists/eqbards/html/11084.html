<b>Subject:</b> A way to fix tedium and predictability was RE: RE: Cler ic/Bard armor quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123345536">I can think of a couple ways to fix that fairly easily.  Whenever a Mob<br/>
spawns, just offset its location by a random number in the X and Y<br/>
directions and pop him to the nearest surface.  This would make the game a<br/>
heck of a lot more difficult at higher levels where a spawn that pops up on<br/>
the other side of a wall is suddenly part of a melee in another room that<br/>
wasn&#39;t expecting more trouble because everything was &#39;predictable&#39;  Camping<br/>
a spawn in a dungeon would become really tough if anyone was camping nearby<br/>
spawns as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Just the amusement of have the PGT Mucktail suddenly spawn between the two<br/>
medd&#39;ing wizards instead of in front of the tanks would be worth the coding<br/>
difficulty.  This cannot be that hard to code, obviously monsters spawn at<br/>
fixed locs, just insert a function call to the random number generator to<br/>
offset the database coords passed to the spawner and you&#39;d be done.  If<br/>
their design is any good, this should be easy to implement.<br/>

In all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>
corner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>
predictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>
the same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>
only things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>
and exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>
virtually impossible to make things challenging - once you <br/>
figure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>
challenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>
