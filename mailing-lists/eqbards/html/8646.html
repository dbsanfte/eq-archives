&gt;	Maybe we should put the answer to this in the FAQ?  Also, can you<br/>
&gt;put the FAQ in a directory at onelist?  That way you don&#39;t have to send out<br/>
&gt;the entire FAQ every week, just send the link.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will add that, but I&#39;ll tell ya, the reason I don&#39;t just link to it on<br/>
the uploads is because I&#39;ve found that people seldom visit the links for<br/>
FAQs, whereas if you put it in front of their faces, they are more likely<br/>
to read it.<br/>
