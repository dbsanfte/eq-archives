Once an hour, I get to feel like low level nuker :).  I&#39;ve used this song<br/>
maybe 20 times?  Not once has a bouncer agro&#39;ed on me.<br/>
<br/>
The other night we had a bad pull of 4 ogres and no enchanter.  We had a<br/>
strong party so there was no question of zoning.  I took the opporunity to<br/>
see if I could use the song to attract some attention to me to keep the<br/>
Ogres off the cleric.  It was the first song I fired up in combat, hit all 4<br/>
for the full damage and not one of them agroed on me... All 4 kept beating<br/>
on our tanks.  Heck, the procs on my Kisch or my Ykesha have a ton more<br/>
taunt value then the dirge!<br/>
