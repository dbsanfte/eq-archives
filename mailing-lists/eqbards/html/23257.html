<div id="ygrps-yiv-952102762">Cheal, when done correctly, *is* &quot;the bread and butter&quot; for the whole group.<br/>
It is the most mana efficient spell when used correctly.  But the whole<br/>
group has to cooperate in order for this method to work.  What we do is<br/>
designate a primary tank.  This is a plate class who can be buffed to the<br/>
highest hit points (if you dont have a lot of choices, this can be a bard<br/>
but usually you have others with higher hps.)  The designated tank needs to<br/>
have the ability to taunt the mobs onto him.  The idea is that you heal him<br/>
when he runs low - usually when he drops below 2 bubs - if the rate of<br/>
damage is &#39;normal&#39; (certain mobs - especially bosses and epics have faster<br/>
than normal rates of damage and cheal alone is too slow.)  So, your tank is<br/>
buffed to ~3k hps and your cheal - in one cast, heals him 2200 hps for 400<br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
All that is well and good when the tank is taking the vast majority of the<br/>
damage.  If you have 2 &quot;tanks&quot; and they get into taunting wars or try to<br/>
outdamage the other, you have a real problem.  When you have 2 people<br/>
needing cheals, the 10 second cast time puts one in jeapordy - not to<br/>
mention the rest of the party if you get tied up for 20 seconds healing.<br/>
Good clerics keep remedy or sup heal memmed to keep the enchanters and other<br/>
alive.  When I see an ench or bard-ench dropping down a bub, I am casting a<br/>
heal their way (yes, I play a cleric too.)  If I get 2 &quot;tanks&quot; who try to<br/>
play like this, I remind them  that the designated tank is gonna get<br/>
(c)healed and mention that I hope the other guy has a lot of bandaids along.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric can heal - but he cant keep the whole group healed unless they<br/>
cooperate and help manage who gets the damage.  I will ask bards and ragners<br/>
and any others to not melee, or to back out of the melee, or switch weapons<br/>
if they are getting too much of the damage (and not the designated tanks.)<br/>

The best clerics I group with understand that cheal is only mana-efficient<br/>
above a certain hit point<br/>
range, which Bards rarely reach.  They&#39;re also aware of the fact that we<br/>
have maybe 55% the hit points of<br/>
a major tank.  The bad ones don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t like playing with the bad ones.<br/>
I always end up hearing &quot;wow,<br/>
you died fast&quot;.  No kidding.<br/>
