<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057913947">Never dueled, so I can&#39;t really be of much assistance, sorry.  I&#39;m curious<br/>
though, does this mean there will be two &quot;players&quot; one of which will tell<br/>
you which of the opposite team to attack?  Also, which get&#39;s played by a<br/>
higher level character?  The king or the queen?<br/>
<br/>
How much damage can you do at level 11 with Chords of Dissonance?  I have<br/>
yet to use it with an instrument. Maybe you could kite a melee class with it<br/>
or keep a caster interupted.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Need assistance please <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi fellow bards!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I need some information assistance. We are having an event on <br/>
&gt; my server,<br/>
&gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the <br/>
&gt; chessboard with duels.<br/>
&gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of <br/>
&gt; King, Queen,<br/>
&gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my <br/>
&gt; guild has a<br/>
&gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I <br/>
&gt; would be asked to<br/>
&gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been <br/>
&gt; chosen as a<br/>
&gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ <br/>
&gt; to possibly come<br/>
&gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to <br/>
&gt; some of the rules of<br/>
&gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. <br/>
&gt; I do know that<br/>
&gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be <br/>
&gt; allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>
&gt; allowed. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best <br/>
&gt; bard that I can<br/>
&gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of <br/>
&gt; you......the experts!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>
