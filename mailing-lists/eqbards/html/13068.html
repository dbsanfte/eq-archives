<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659948152">There is the bard at the NK wiz spires - Cordelia (does not answer hails)<br/>
and another in the Hogcaller&#39;s Tavern in West Freeport (gets killed by evils<br/>
a lot).  Hehe, check out the bard in the tavern in East Freeport - he has a<br/>
sword in one hand and a lute in the other.   The bard - Misty Storyswapper<br/>
at the tent in West Karana near Qey Hills zone (and she patrols Qey Hills?)<br/>
- she talks of Guard McCluskey - maybe she talks more. Maybe you have to<br/>
swap a story with her?<br/>

		Also, other than bard NPCs in the three guilds and the bard<br/>
messengers<br/>

are there in the<br/>
