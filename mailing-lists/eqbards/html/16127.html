they were increased by THAT much....  interesting...<br/>

What was the Druid tossing in?  If it was careless lightning or something<br/>
more powerful that would explain it.  Druids have some pretty hefty DD<br/>
spells.<br/>

&gt; A couple of friends and I were in Steamfont killing Mino Lords the other<br/>
&gt; night, trying to get me out of 31 so they could bask in the glow of my<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; song, when the strangest thing happened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was with a level 36 Barbarian Shaman (with her pet) who was soloing, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was grouped with a level 30 Druid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We figured that I would get exp faster if I grouped with the druid instead<br/>
&gt; of the Shaman.  So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill one.<br/>
&gt; While she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; her while we awaited our turn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of<br/>
Fulfil&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Curtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along with<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; small DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for the<br/>
&gt; kill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it,<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; her pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; yet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; equipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>
&gt; 2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>
&gt; 3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>
&gt; 4.  It&#39;s a bug<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
