&gt;      They say that stamina effect you total hit points but just equipping <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;      plus stamina item has no effect.  What happens when you level?  Say<br/>
&gt;      just before you level you equip several stamina adding items.  Will<br/>
&gt;      this increase the hit points given when you level?  Will you lose the<br/>
&gt;      extra points if you take them off?  This could be a nice way to pump<br/>
&gt;      up our meager hitpoint total with a little planning and the purchase<br/>
&gt;      of some jewelry.  Has any one tried this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Thanks<br/>

don&#39;t get any bonus hp when you level from wearing STA items.<br/>
Personally i consider Stamina the lowest priority physical stat when it <br/>
comes to stat buffing items. I prefer to have higher dex agi or str.<br/>
