&gt; you Harm :-)  I always enjoy hearing suggestions on how to play better and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s refreshing to find someone who is willing to give input but also has an<br/>
&gt; open mind. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is why I do think Bards are the best group leaders...<br/>
&gt; doing their job requires them to always be moving and switching songs and<br/>
&gt; adapting, so they generally are much more aware of what is going on.<br/>
<br/>

  of the environment and adapt to changes.  I agree completely.<br/>
