<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227621713">I paid 25 for the COM coin and gave the druid who gave me the Emerald Jungle<br/>
coin 25P.<br/>
<br/>
The kaesora coin I had to shell out 50P, but it was the last one I needed,<br/>
and I wasn&#39;t about to let a measly 25p extra get in my way (little did I<br/>
know that my guild had gotten me one in Kaesora the night before after I<br/>
left).  Still whats 50P?  At lvl 35 I usually make at least 200P a night<br/>
(keep in mind when I play I play for like 5 hours).<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to a question for all of you out there.  When fighting<br/>
casters I normally go to full pixie strike mode.  I can usually get about<br/>
half the spells interupted (including almost all heals as they are fairly<br/>
slow cast).  When fighting mellee mobs I normally play Chant of Battle (drum<br/>
song), Binding (our enchanters LOVE me for this, as it seems to taunt all<br/>
the mezzed mobs to me when they break) and something else (hymm, damage<br/>
shield, rhythm, depends).<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I would now be better served throwing the drum in my hand and<br/>
singing rhythm, chant of battle and either guardian rhythms or Curtaling<br/>
chant or hymm (with mandolin) against casters?<br/>
<br/>
I may experiment this weekend, but I&#39;d like some input first.<br/>
