&gt; I did another test last night, just to be sure how bad the nerfing of<br/>
&gt; Lullaby really was, and to have a baseline to test against this patch to see<br/>
&gt; if anything changes.  I had the following results vs my West Freeport test<br/>
&gt; subject.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These percentages are very close to what I got.  But:<br/>

&gt; Number of Total Resists:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Without Mandolin:		19		Pct: <br/>
&gt; With Mandolin:		12<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You got close to double the number of total resists that I got<br/>
(10/415).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Number of Secondary Resists:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Without Mandolin:		127		Pct: 38.9%!!!<br/>
&gt; With Mandolin:		75		Pct: 36.4%!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You got slightly fewer secondary resists than me (163/415 =<br/>
39.3% with lute).  This would support the theory that they<br/>
have a sign error in the charisma bonus for secondary resists,<br/>
as my charisma was 154 vs your 133.  I&#39;ll have to test it<br/>
again tonight - I&#39;ll try to get to BB and get a skunk to spray<br/>
me, if they can still affect me at all.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m going to hold off reposting this on the official<br/>
board until the Necro pet bruhaha dies down.  Good work.<br/>
