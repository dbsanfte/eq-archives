Subject: [eqbards] Adventures with Fear<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well as hoped I reached my 26th song last Thursday evening and quickly<br/>
&gt; scribed it.  I was in a group at the time so didn&#39;t get to try out the<br/>
&gt; Fear/Chains tricks that evening.  However we got hit by a huge train by an<br/>
&gt; ogre running out of the goblin mines and everyone was sure we were going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; die.  The Zone call was made, so I strummed up Screech and crossed my<br/>
&gt; fingers.  Every single goblin fled.  The party seeing this decided to try<br/>
&gt; and pick them off as they came back.  With our druid and ranger snaring<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; and me playing Denon&#39;s, Hymn, and Screech, we were able to kill off a 14<br/>
&gt; goblin train 2 at a time.  It was glorious! </span></blockquote></div>
