<div id="ygrps-yiv-676127522">We took 36ish people to take him on after the patch and the amount of sheer<br/>
&quot;ownage&quot; had us all laughing our asses off. If this had been nagafen we<br/>
woulda spanked him soundly with zero deaths and clerics all at 50% mana.<br/>
<br/>
It wasnt nagafen it was Venril unfortunately. He methodically knocked out<br/>
the tanks one by one in such a systematic manor that everybody was just<br/>
waiting their time patiently to die. Nuke&#39;s hit him for full damage and his<br/>
320 melee is laughable. But his 2k&#39;ish lifetap every few seconds just<br/>
decimated us one by one till we called evac on the one group remaining. We<br/>
all had over 200mr thanks to the bards and enchanter buffs but it made<br/>
little to no difference. He was at either 90% to FH when it was all over.<br/>
<br/>
As far as strategy, all i can think of since mr didnt seem to do anything is<br/>
figuring out whether his lifetap is a spell or a proc. If it its a spell<br/>
then mana drains are the order of the day, if its a proc, then we have to<br/>
get turgurs on him before anybody bothers nuking or hittin him. I tried my<br/>
Brusco&#39;s stun on him and he just resisted (stuck on lvl 60 ancient wyv&#39;s<br/>
np), same with fear. Maybe stuns will stick if you have enough being casted<br/>
on him, but either way you have to prevent that &quot;You feel a tugging at your<br/>
soul&quot; from going off.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody has any luck or knows any strategy suggestions please share =)<br/>

&gt; we grabbed 2 warrior, 2 rogue, 1 cleric, and 1 bard legs from him before<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; got beefed up.  i think that warrior is right before a new strategy is<br/>
&gt; devised.<br/>
