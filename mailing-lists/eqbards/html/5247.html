<b>Subject:</b> Re: Charisma vs Mob Resist Part 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412925091">I think charisma does effect the mob&#39;s resist rate for certain songs.  When <br/>
I was using the claws, my cha is 122.  Hardly any blue resist my charm, <br/>
fear, or chain song.  But when I was using the writhing staff with cha <br/>
dropped to 113, I get quite a few resists and sometime multiple of them in a <br/>
roll.  I am at the point that I may decide to go back to claws and put away <br/>
the staff.<br/>

&gt;OK, call me stupid but I&#39;m still not sure how to interpret this.  The way I<br/>
&gt;read it, your Charisma stat has no impact whatsoever on your chances to<br/>
&gt;resist a spell directed at you.  Makes sense to me.  The second sentence<br/>
&gt;&quot;..interact/affect creatures&quot; seems to indicate that a higher charisma <br/>
&gt;means<br/>
&gt;you have a better chance of affecting mobs with your songs, i.e. less <br/>
&gt;chance<br/>
&gt;for them to resist.  This reopens the issue I raised last week.  Example:<br/>
&gt;Two 20th level bards attempt to use Lullaby song against a 23d level mob.<br/>
&gt;One bard has a charisma of 85.  The other bard has charisma of 100.  <br/>
&gt;Singing<br/>
&gt;and instrument skills both the same.  Based on how I interpret Butler&#39;s<br/>
&gt;comment, the bard with the 100 charisma has a better chance of putting the<br/>
&gt;mob to sleep.  If charisma has no effect on mob resistance, then both bards<br/>
&gt;would have an equal chance of putting the mob to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would really like to know the correct answer to this issue.  I wear items<br/>
&gt;that increase my charisma for the sole purpose of increasing my chances of<br/>
&gt;affecting mobs with my songs.  I have other items I can wear that increase<br/>
&gt;other stats as well as improve my AC.  If charisma doesn&#39;t affect mobs<br/>
&gt;resistance, there is no reason, for me to wear the charisma increasing <br/>
&gt;items<br/>
&gt;unless I am selling stuff to merchants.  I guess wearing the charisma items<br/>
&gt;to reduce my chance of missing notes is a reason to wear them but I could<br/>
&gt;live with missing the notes in exchange for the benefit the other items<br/>
&gt;give.<br/>
