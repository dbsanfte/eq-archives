<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490261880">The main problem with the majority of our damage songs is they do not give <br/>
feedback on how much damage they do.  A wizard casts her Ice Comet spell and <br/>
sees: &#39;A Gnoll Pup says, hit by 1100 damage non-melee&#39;<br/>
or something like that, we launch or instrument barage of death and see:<br/>
A gnoll pup winces<br/>
A gnoll pup winces<br/>
Your wounds begin to heal<br/>
<br/>
The only way to get the data is to duel a friend of hit a PvP zone and have <br/>
them keep careful track of the damage loss.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my guidelines for reporting information to the website to find the <br/>
damage formulas for our songs:<br/>
Please use the following methodology for gathering data on song <br/>
effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
1) Use only normal store bought instruments, ie Hand Drum, Lute/Mandolin, <br/>
Horn, Wooden Flute.<br/>
<br/>
2) Test the effects both with and without instruments.<br/>
<br/>
3) Test Hymn of Restoration for standing regeneration rate on a Non-Troll <br/>
race.  If you have any sort of item the speeds HP recovery (ie Rubicite <br/>
breastplate) be sure to remove it first.<br/>
<br/>
4) Do not adjust PvP damage figures.<br/>
<br/>
5) If testing attack speed up/slowdown effects be sure you have a clean <br/>
connection with little or no lag.<br/>
<br/>
6) When sending in a report be sure to include your level :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So send in those data points! :)<br/>
