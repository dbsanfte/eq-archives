<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674671829"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well after awhile you have to talk about something I mean how many topics<br/>
&gt; can you talk about? Especially 7 months after the game. If something nice<br/>
&gt; about the bard happens in game then I guaruntee you that it will be posted<br/>
&gt; up immediatly but until it does we need to talk about something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And I apologize for bringing in the politics into this list.<br/>
  The world revolves around politics, and thus naturally Norrath<br/>
  would make an extension of the real world.  It was inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
  The truth is this list is very reflective of the state of the game.<br/>
  We are all grown up now.  I came here when I was L20, that was a long<br/>
  time ago.  I&#39;ve learned a lot here, made a lot of friends, pissed <br/>
  off a lot of people, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone has opinions.<br/>
<br/>
  Every server is being aflicted by a power guild(s) taking over the <br/>
  things that 90% of the rest of the server would like to do.  This<br/>
  in every way affects Bards... and Enchanters, and Warriors, and etc.<br/>
  In the past this list has proposed solutions to non-bard questions,<br/>
  thus is the nature of the list to investigate and solve problems.<br/>
  I can guarentee that this list distributes more in-game mechanics<br/>
  than any of list out there.  But more than that, it distributes <br/>
  a fun and cheerful attitude.  As bards, we know a little bit about<br/>
  everything, justly so.<br/>
<br/>
  The hot topic of elite guilds taking over the server is something <br/>
  which needs to addressed, as it impacts all of us.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not:   What &lt;foo&gt; instrument has &lt;foo&gt; effect.<br/>
<br/>
  But how much more can we talk about songs and instruments?  There<br/>
  is nothing new to discuss.  Until a patch or new song/skill, that <br/>
  is.  I&#39;ve also found people here have a very solid understanding<br/>
  of the game as a whole and it&#39;s playability.  So, maybe a new <br/>
  list needs to be created to voice out playability issues to other<br/>
  people of similiar or like minds, but I find you all to be the<br/>
  first place to turn to for _any_ eq advice.<br/>
<br/>
  We all share a common thread, but that common thread is storytelling,<br/>
  general advice, and not just when selo&#39;s outruns sow, or why X song<br/>
  isn&#39;t working right.<br/>
<br/>
  Again I apologize for the post, however this problem is plaguing<br/>
  the community as a whole and wanted to make the bard community,<br/>
  at least, aware of it&#39;s strain on some of us.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
