<b>Subject:</b> How you play your bard.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035942236">I am on the Eq-Australia and there was a thread started about how bards<br/>
should be played.  I thought it would be interesting to ask here as well.<br/>
<br/>
I play Jacana as what I call a &quot;battle bard&quot;.  If the group is a well<br/>
rounded group of 6 then I will &quot;sit back&quot; and play my instruments but if<br/>
it&#39;s 4 or less Jacana is right there in the fight.  And honestly I like it<br/>
that way :)<br/>
<br/>
Our group is camped at Lake of Ill Omen and right now I am the puller for<br/>
the group (I have speed!).  That&#39;s another thing I love :)  Maybe a bit of a<br/>
control freak but I like to feel like I am active in the group.<br/>
<br/>
With my pulling there I have been working on my kiting as well.  And it<br/>
quite enjoy it!  For me I pull with a bellows and off I run.  Most of the<br/>
stuff we have hunted so far can&#39;t keep up so I run off and stop wait till<br/>
range and bellow again untill I get it back to the group.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I have found with bards is that the group can pull something<br/>
near while I am off scouting.  I will bring that back and run around the<br/>
group and bellow....<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe I am not &quot;playing&quot; my bard the way some expect.  Some seem to<br/>
think the bard should sit back and sing their butt off.  If I group with<br/>
people I don&#39;t know I ask how they want me to play.  Most people say they<br/>
have never grouped with bards so do what ever :)  I like those people....<br/>

Jacana, Wood Elf, Innoruuk - of the I am one bubble from level</div>
