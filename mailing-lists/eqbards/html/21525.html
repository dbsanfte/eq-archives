Hello all,<br/>
I noticed a number of people here talking about the way that creatures <br/>
decide to flee, referring to a change that went in with the last patch. <br/>
After speaking with the programmer responsible for AI among other things, <br/>
it&#39;s apparent that there was a change made while optimizing code that <br/>
caused an &quot;unintended fix&quot; to the AI. Though no one sat down and said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to make creatures flee more&quot;, that&#39;s the result.<br/>
Without going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to <br/>
flee, there are several &quot;components&quot; that NPCs use to determine how brave <br/>
they are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the <br/>
interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other <br/>
less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space <br/>
allocated to a variable that hasn&#39;t yet been &#39;set&#39; to anything, and usually <br/>
contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than <br/>
they should have been.<br/>
We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial <br/>
impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how <br/>
things are turning out so far.<br/>
What are your thoughts?<br/>

&gt;Did anyone else note a change in the fleeing over the last couple of nights<br/>
&gt;since the patch?  I had some weird things going on where mobs that normally<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t run until quite hurt were running away at over 50% health.  This made<br/>
&gt;the Chains nerf really a big deal.  We had to zone twice because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;even hardly slow the mobs fleeing sine they were running away so early.<br/>
&gt;Anyone know if this is a permanent change?<br/>
