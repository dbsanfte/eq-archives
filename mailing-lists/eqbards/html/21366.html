<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099486324">What you say is oh so true Shada.  Although I personally find being without<br/>
Lullaby is a huge downgrade in my usefulness.  I think for me one of the<br/>
greatest disappointments was when I finally got Pixie Strike.  I remember<br/>
long ago how many people here raved on its effectiveness at stopping<br/>
casters.  Since I didn&#39;t get it until they added the secondary resist I<br/>
never got to see it be useful.  I still get resisted at least 50% of the<br/>
time when trying it.  Some of that time it still disrupts, just doesn&#39;t mez.<br/>
Sadder still, I was having better success using Pixie Strike to pause a<br/>
fleeing mob so a real snarer &quot;a shadowknight&quot; could get off a darkness spell<br/>
on it.  This was more effective than trying to chain a stupid goblin that<br/>
flees at just under 50%.  To have a spell that&#39;s primary effect is to slow<br/>
something down nerfed to be below the secondary effect of a DoT is<br/>
ridiculous.  All because Verant is apparently too stupid to have mobs attack<br/>
when their movement is reduced below a certain amount like they do when<br/>
rooted.  I couldn&#39;t care less if the stupid thing turned around and started<br/>
whcking on me again, I just don&#39;t want it running away and killing my entire<br/>
party when its friends return.  Of course this was never even considered by<br/>
Verant who was too busy being horrified that some player might have thought<br/>
of a tactic that they did not foresee.<br/>

i don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the issue for<br/>
most.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s the way bards are<br/>
being treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>
expected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of verant decisions<br/>
(nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make decisions about<br/>
bards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>
