<div id="ygrps-yiv-409240583">The dragoons actually scowl at you becuase of religion, not class.  Dragoons<br/>
can inexplicably see your religion.  fortunately the dragoons don&#39;t give the<br/>
quests.  Some of the other npc&#39;s would also still be dangerous, but not too<br/>
bad.  My enchanter with dark elf illusion could get a lot of the npc&#39;s to<br/>
talk and with alliance could get the quests, but an enchanter really isn&#39;t<br/>
self sufficient enough to do quests.<br/>

wondering what quests you are hoping the guise will allow you to do.  you<br/>
may be able to use a guise/carillion combo in some cases, but the npcs also<br/>
look at class in many cases and it won&#39;t help you.  i.e. i went into neriak<br/>
for the first time and the guards still scowl at me with the dark elf<br/>
illusion.  just curious though, i have not extensively tested this.<br/>
