<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-362563671">These are some of my ideas for songs:<br/>
<br/>
1) Make bards even more useful in groups by giving them an evac with a 3<br/>
second casting time (normal time for bard songs). The effect of this evac<br/>
is random and the group could end up at any druid or wizard port in<br/>
Norrath. The other cost of the song would be that it uses 250-300 mana<br/>
(1.5-2 bubs) therefore if the bard evacs from Guk and ends up in Gtr Fay<br/>
they can&#39;t keep using the song to get back to S Ro.<br/>
<br/>
2) Upgraded Charm song at level 39 for mobs level 37-49. We can charm a<br/>
giant, why can&#39;t we charm a Dar ghoul knight or a Sonic bat?<br/>
<br/>
3) Invis to undead is another option (but what level can it be used?). Will<br/>
we need invis to undead in Kunark and is it worth using a song slot for it.<br/>
<br/>
4) A mind wipe song would be great for bards, a flute based song that<br/>
mezzes and mind wipes the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
5) A song that allows bards to EVADE combat (cross between feign death and<br/>
the rogue&#39;s evade skill). This song would be useful for group settings, if<br/>
the bard is taking a beating he simply sings this song and it&#39;s fools the<br/>
monster into thinking he is one of them for 5 seconds, in this time the<br/>
group has a chance to make the mob attack someone else (this would be good<br/>
for a bard as it uses our roguish abilities aswell as our acting/performing<br/>
side). This would not work in solo settings though as the monsters would<br/>
have no one else to attack.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few ideas here aswell as some songs that have already been<br/>
discussed. I think the bind song would be cool but it&#39;s a bit too late now.<br/>
That song should of been introduced in the mid 20&#39;s.<br/>
