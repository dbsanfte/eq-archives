&gt;aggro bugs) then<br/>
&gt;   you could play level 1 song and heal and damage shield if you really<br/>
&gt;wanted to, but i would<br/>
&gt;   suggest parking yourself next to the cleric and singing mana song while<br/>
&gt;swinging weapons.<br/>
&gt;   if you are in a caster group then there is not much point to singing<br/>
&gt;anything but mana song,<br/>
&gt;   heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   - Now I find this funny.  You recomend that as a bard use weapons.  And<br/>
&gt;yet just yesterday someone went on about how the &quot;battle bard&quot; is not a<br/>
&gt;great idea.... *HURM*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, i was too busy/lazy to comment/read that thread but i probly would have said<br/>
something along the lines that there is always going to be a situation where one<br/>
strategy or another is better to use.  battle bard has it&#39;s place, as does chant bard,<br/>
heal bard, charm bard, etc.  this is one of those situations where battle bard is<br/>
going to be almost the only option available to you.</div>
