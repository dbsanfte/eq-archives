Could you please test Lullaby against some mobs closer to your<br/>
level?  The guy claiming it worked great for him in Runnyeye<br/>
posted a logfile with a sample size of 456 (good enough for<br/>
me).  He got a 10% primary resist rate, and a 28% secondary<br/>
resist rate.<br/>
<br/>
This would support the theory that there&#39;s a sign error in the<br/>
secondary resist check - r goes up as R goes down.  But since<br/>
r+R = approx constant, the song still seems as ineffective to<br/>
you.  Please do the test and send me the logfile.  Even if<br/>
your overall resist rate is the same as mine, the difference<br/>
in r and R may be enough to prove a sign error.<br/>
