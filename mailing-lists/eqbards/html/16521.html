<div id="ygrps-yiv-667073951">At 60th Hymn will heal 22/tick with a store bought lute, as will Niv&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Weaving the two gives ya 44/tick.  So yes we need a new healing song that<br/>
will stack with the these two.  My song suggestion would give you 88/tick<br/>
with a standard lute (@60th).  That may not be enough :)<br/>

<br/>
  I can heal for roughly mid 30s in lguk and things hit for 100.<br/>
  That&#39;s a third of the damage being done just in healing.<br/>
<br/>
  I would hope I could stick to that ratio, and heal 100 per tick<br/>
  when mobs can do 300-400 dmg per swing.<br/>
<br/>
  You are not thinking ahead, you are stuck in this shell of a <br/>
  broken game in the current state.  Thing are going to change.<br/>
  Our songs have to be excellent at L60 versus L63 NPCs.  No one<br/>
  is thinking down that path yet.  And it&#39;s even hard for me to.<br/>
  <br/>
  +75 STR, and you&#39;re like OMG, that&#39;s too much.  <br/>
<br/>
  -or-<br/>
<br/>
  +100 AC, *nothing* gives that much you think... well at L60 <br/>
  maybe it should.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe we should heal 150 per tick with a +50 AC shield, I mean<br/>
  when was the last L53+ mob you encountered without bringing <br/>
  24+ people.  We&#39;re gonna have to fight L53+ mobs in groups of<br/>
  six people, just like you fight L45 mobs in groups of six.<br/>
