<div id="ygrps-yiv-477001656">Stats are generally not important.  Many tests have been done and most<br/>
are inconclusive.  The primary stats you should concentrate your<br/>
equipment on are AC and HP, then resists (although they are situation<br/>
dependent and bards can get by without them though that will obviously<br/>
negate using other songs you may need to be playing).<br/>
<br/>
It is not a bad idea to get each of your &quot;important&quot; stats above 100<br/>
(Str, Dex, Agi, Sta, Cha).  Str for ATK rating and to carry more, Dex is<br/>
supposedly (i.e. tests inconclusive or show very little benefit) linked<br/>
to missed notes on songs and increases proc rate on procing weapons, Agi<br/>
gets a huge AC boost at 75Agi and a moderate boost at 100Agi but above<br/>
100 it has diminishing returns, Sta gives you more HP (i.e. good) and<br/>
Sta over 100 means when your bar is empty you experience no adverse<br/>
effects whatsoever, Cha is supposedly (i.e. tests inconclusive or show<br/>
very little benefit) linked to lower resists on charm, mes, and lull<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely feel free to post your equipment and money resources to<br/>
upgrade, it will definitely not be flooding the list hehe.<br/>

<br/>
To that extent I still don&#39;t know what I have to compare myself to. For<br/>
instance I do not know to what points I should have raised my charisma<br/>
in<br/>
this level? Or my other stats of course. I am a capable player though<br/>
and I<br/>
might be considered as a well faring bard (as far as I can read from<br/>
faces<br/>
of the customers, that is). What I need here is some guidance, but<br/>
perhaps<br/>
this is not the place to flood with messages, so I could prefer<br/>
individual<br/>
mailings, if our moderator does mind multiple messages addressing the<br/>
same<br/>
issue here. But would be happy if this one turns out to be a thread on<br/>
his<br/>
own. *grin*<br/>
