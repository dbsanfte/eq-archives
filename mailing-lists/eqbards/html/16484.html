<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760051174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.  A Stun.  This would be awesome...but most likely broken since we need<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never happen.  Enchanter specialty.  WAY too powerful for 0 mana<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  this one is a little bizarre..dunno if they can do it...a group Damage<br/>
&gt; Shield that has a 2ndary effect (example: a Lightning-based Damage shield<br/>
&gt; [shield of static? &lt;grin&gt;] that does X damage and the attacker has to save<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be stunned for 3 sec or something.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ...i am big on the idea of a stun...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, never happen.  ENTIRELY too powerful.  It would totally unbalance us.<br/>
I could see bards soloing almost anything with this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  Bards need a party buff that directly adds to attack (ala grim aura,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fire<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fists)  .  Probably would do other stuff too...dunno how to present that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; viable idea.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed, this would be an excellent addition to our repetoir of attack buff<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  we&#39;re missing the 39 song?  How about a self-only vampiric<br/>
 </span></blockquote>regeneration<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; song...where heal like 10% of the damage we do( in melee).  dunno what the<br/>
&gt; efficiency would have to be to make the song useable...John(tm)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;d prefer an upgrade to our Charm song here so that we can charm<br/>
up to 49 and then make 51 another upgrade to charm.  That should keep us in<br/>
our ability to charm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5.  Really bizarre...a flute based song...that summons a pet (preferably a<br/>
&gt; giant rat) that should be a reasonable power level (like the shaman<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pet...12+<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; levels behind shaman)  You could balance this by: making the song have to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; running continuous, with a 5 min repop on the button.  Or, have it drain<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mana<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (like the shaman spell frenzy) and die when bard is at 0 mana.<br/>
&gt; ...i was shooting for a pied piper type thing here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm... doubt that will happen.  But it&#39;s worth a shot. Interesting concept<br/>
on the Frenzy parallel<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6.  I want an upgraded AE mez...with a built in DOT. &lt;Grin&gt;  It drops the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dot,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and then they have to make their Mez save...ok this one is stupid...but it<br/>
&gt; sounded good before my morning coffee.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe just a tad unrealistic there ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kaleid<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have many ideas of my own though.  I like what we have and every<br/>
idea I&#39;ve come up with just mirrors another song or spell already existing<br/>
in the game.  I&#39;d love to see our new songs be _unique_ to us.</div>
