<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This is true.  But unlike spells, which can be cast and forgotten about for<br/>
&gt;long periods of time, Bard songs must be continuously sung to work<br/>
&gt;effectively.  A song that could be sung and have a permanent effect would be<br/>
&gt;contrarian to the way the class works.  Forgetting game balance and all other<br/>
&gt;issues, a binding song just makes no sense in the world of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, in Norrath the singing of a song by a Bard causes a spell to be cast.<br/>
That spell has a duration past the time when the Bard stops singing.  This is<br/>
the mechanism that allows us to twist.  It&#39;s not the singing that generates the<br/>
effect, the singing creates the magic, the magic creates the effect.  The magic<br/>
has a life of it&#39;s own, just like a caster&#39;s spell, only much shorter.   This is<br/>
not the same as the &#39;Listener&#39;s emotions stay swayed for a few seconds, hence<br/>
the delay&quot; argument.  Levitate has no emotions, when you stop singing, you don&#39;t<br/>
plummet because the spell you cast by singing has not ended yet.<br/>
<br/>
We truly are no different than a caster.  Our songs do not have a continuous<br/>
effect, we must continuously sing so that the &#39;spell&#39; can be recast every few<br/>
seconds.  In addition, the act of binding is like moving a rock.  You don&#39;t have<br/>
to apply energy to the rock to make it stay, only for the move.   If a Caster&#39;s<br/>
Bind were a continuous output of energy, then it would use Mana forever, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Teleport is a good example.  When you teleport your party, they don&#39;t snap back<br/>
into place once you stop singing. You have made a permanent change with a<br/>
temporary application of magic.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Indeed we are a breed apart.  As another poster has written we are &quot;no-class.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;I would almost say that there are four types of player classes in EQ:<br/>
&gt;casters, melee, hybrids, and bards.  True, we don&#39;t have the combat skills<br/>
&gt;that the 3 hybrids do.  But we can do some pretty amazing things to<br/>
&gt;compensate.  We don&#39;t use mana like the other hybrids (Dirge excepted).  We<br/>
&gt;can reduce downtime like no other class in the game.  We can fill wildcard<br/>
&gt;spots in just about any group: from crowd control to tanking.  To give us<br/>
&gt;these combat skills would unbalance us wildly, and the next thing you know all<br/>
&gt;the kewl d00dz would be playing bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, just parry would be enough to move us from Caster to Hybrid in my<br/>
mind.  I would think that this would not overpower us and attract the d00dz :)<br/>
<br/>
I would say that the wildcard aspect of the Bard is what started me on this<br/>
whole thing.  Our songs duplicate the effects of spells from each of the casting<br/>
classes.  They each get bind.  But the guys who do it &#39;all&#39;, don&#39;t do something<br/>
that every one of the others do.  Why? Only because of our classification, which<br/>
is unjustified.  Giving Bards bind would no doubt bring an uproar from the melee<br/>
classes.  Happens everytime anyone changes any class.  But what would be the<br/>
basis for each complaint?  Bards are melee! We are melee! No fair!<br/>
<br/>
That premise is wrong.  We&#39;re no more melee than Shamans and Clerics.  Nobody<br/>
complains that Rangers should get Bind because Clerics get it.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly (I know-Thank God :P), the fact that we don&#39;t use mana is offset by the<br/>
weakness and short duration of our songs.  This is balanced, tho I think we<br/>
still come up short, as &#39;infinite&#39; casting really only means fight time.  While<br/>
not in combat, ANY caster can keep 3 effects up forever while medding between,<br/>
or do more damage than us via DD during the same time while medding.  It only<br/>
counts in combat, where we can go longer, but to usually less effect until we or<br/>
the mob dies.  Sure a mage can only Ice comet 4 times.  But our &#39;infinite&#39;<br/>
effect will never equal that damage before combat is over.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I don&#39;t think the mana usage issue should &#39;add&#39; power to our class<br/>
for balancing purposes.  It has a built in balance in relation to casters.<br/>
<br/>
Whew! Sorry, I just wanted to be clear.<br/>
<br/>
Golias formally swears never to beat the temporary effect horse again...<br/>
