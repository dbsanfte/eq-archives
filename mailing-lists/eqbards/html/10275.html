&gt;  Perhaps, we could work out a subquest for you.  Maybe run<br/>
&gt;  some errands for me, pickup a few items I&#39;ve been looking<br/>
&gt;  for.  I believe I have spare BP components laying around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have been quite generous with me already, sir. I&#39;ve noticed there is a<br/>
line of perception somewhere between hearing people say &quot;Nice weapon.<br/>
Where&#39;d you get that?&quot; and &quot;Hey, uber-twink, why do you need to group with<br/>
us newbies? Vox is that way!&quot; I definitely prefer the former perception. ;)<br/>
<br/>
A subquest for lambent could be entertaining. I do wish to feel I&#39;ve earned<br/>
all the lambent armor I wear, and had envisioned beginning to group for the<br/>
bracer items in a couple levels and the other items later in my 20&#39;s. (Nice<br/>
to be in a bard-friendly guild now). I&#39;ve seen high teen bards with lotsa<br/>
dough and connections that already have the lambent BP and other pieces, and<br/>
it seemed too soon to me. I would at least insist on paying for the jewels.<br/>
250pp would leave me absolutely broke. That, and a few laps around Norrath<br/>
getting items for a subquest would alleviate much of the &quot;twink&quot; guilt. :p<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a fine HEF, Harmonic, nomatter what they say! =D<br/>
