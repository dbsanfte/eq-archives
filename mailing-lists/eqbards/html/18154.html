&gt; While the following is a spoiler - it describes travel to and from Kunark.<br/>
&gt; I &quot;wasted&quot; a good four hours of time so unless you consider<br/>
&gt; waiting for and<br/>
&gt; on boats for long periods of time a vital part of the role-playing<br/>
&gt; experience - I would suggest you read on.<br/>

&gt; We spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure<br/>
&gt; out how my<br/>
&gt; Guild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.  Arkin died once...  Then we<br/>
&gt; decided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back to<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br/>

encampment seemed to be about the equivalent of running from Qeynos to<br/>
Freeport (ok maybe a bit exagerated but at least to Highpass)<br/>
<br/>
We wandered for 4 hours before we found our way to the city zone.  Then the<br/>
city took a bit to find as well, very cool to feel like a newbie again!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, to get from the wizzy spires/druid rings to town, I think you have to<br/>
go through the ice caves so you&#39;ll have to find a hole in a mountain to get<br/>
to the proper part of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Very long trip but very fun, baddies all over the place, over half of them<br/>
see Invis.<br/>
<br/>
And the level 51 travel song gave me a reason to unmem selo&#39;s in an outdoor<br/>
zone for the first time ever. WOW!<br/>
