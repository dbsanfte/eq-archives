I need to note an observation that I have made about how easily Bards can be<br/>
misunderstood, and miss-played.  There are basically two types of skills to<br/>
develop while playing EQ.  Character skill (e.g. high 1h slash skill) and<br/>
Player skill (the ability to twist songs, and juggle equipment). <br/>
<br/>
While there is a limited number of actual character skills out there, the<br/>
number of techniques that a Player can implement are vast.  Knowing which<br/>
songs to load for an area, knowing the areas layout all make your character<br/>
more successful.  Classes like warrior (not to knock them) are inherently<br/>
more Character based and less Player based.  This is why I think that most<br/>
of us are drawn to bards in the end.  We can put more of ourselves into our<br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>
I know that if I were to give my account to a newbie player he would have a<br/>
lot of investigating and dying to do before he/she (the person not the<br/>
character) would have the skill to wield the character in an effective way.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a Warrior (the opposite of the spectrum) given to a<br/>
player would be relatively easy for them to catch on to.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that everyone who plays a Bard may not (be<br/>
able to or even want to) become the song twisting keyboard mouse Ninja that<br/>
will bring the most out of their Character.  But everyone has that chance.<br/>
And I like it.  If practicing difficult techniques to work around that tough<br/>
monster gets nerfed, it will be a really sad day.  I hope IM not rambling<br/>
too much, but I think you&#39;ll get my point.<br/>
