<b>Subject:</b> CHA effects (was Re: Selo&#39;s Constant Chain) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129665458">First off, I too have noticed that Chain has been wearing off much <br/>
quicker than usual, as of the &quot;message&quot; patch.  Sometimes, I would <br/>
have to switch to constantly refreshing the song to keep it sticking.<br/>
<br/>
I did NOT notice this shortened duration for Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, <br/>
though.  Perhaps something was changed in the patch effecting the <br/>
movement portion of the song, and of course if the snare effect<br/>
breaks <br/>
the slowdown effect wears off as well.  Largo&#39;s, being a slowdown and <br/>
AC debuff, seems unaffected by the change.  I wonder, were Snare and <br/>
the Darkness series affected by this also?<br/>
<br/>
The real question I have is this.  I thought that CHA only affected <br/>
the resist rates on mind influencing songs, the ones with the head <br/>
icon, like Solon&#39;s, Lament, etc.  Some recent posts seem to suggest <br/>
otherwise.  Has this been tested at all?  I know that CHA is also<br/>
tied <br/>
in to missing notes, but does it effect the duration of songs like<br/>
the <br/>
Chants and Chain as well?<br/>
