<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795998345">by the way, for those interested in tests, the bard in our guild (also the<br/>
guild leader) with the belt of concordance (only 2 on our server) comfirms<br/>
it is the same as FBSS speed.  too bad as i was expecting dragon-like haste<br/>
(30-35%) instead of fbss (15%).  not that i wouldn&#39;t take one, it has great<br/>
stats.  i haven&#39;t even been to sky yet, since when we go it&#39;s usually for<br/>
several days due to cost and i don&#39;t have that kind of time to put in.  i am<br/>
content to wait til i have gained a few levels before i go up.<br/>
