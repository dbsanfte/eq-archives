<div id="ygrps-yiv-813088311">On March 01, 2000, a being calling itself &quot;zath7&quot; posted some rather rude <br/>
things all over several very important threads (including a bard <br/>
thread).  I forwarded that information to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:feedback@...">feedback@...</a><br/>

Not only is it a half-@$$ed attempt at a &quot;personalized&quot; form-reply, but <br/>
it&#39;s apparent that they didn&#39;t even take the time to sign it.  Normally, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t complain but sheesh, late, AND pointless?!  Why even bother?<br/>
