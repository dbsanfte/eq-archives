<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695677433">I just noticed this in the hundreds of these I get every day so I thought<br/>
I&#39;d respond...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;level:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    just made 10 tonite :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;do you party or solo:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I do both. Depends. I party a lot with a wood elf druid named Callaiss<br/>
(played by my husband).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;fav blue to kill:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    depends... I like to kill goblins, but some are green, some are blue -<br/>
although I havn&#39;t checked them out since I made my new level tonite, so<br/>
maybe I can actually get a goblin shaman to con blue or at least black to<br/>
me??? We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;unfav place to die in:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    anywhere - I&#39;m not fond of dying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;most number of deaths getting a corpse back:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Hmmmm.... lets see... I think it was three - it&#39;s not fun running from<br/>
Gfaydark to BBlock with nothing on and no weapons... especially when you get<br/>
lost and an orc attacks.... although Selos does help. I guess I&#39;d better<br/>
stick to the roads, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;most number of levels with no death (if any :):<br/>
&gt;never happen, our motto is go strange places and die there  ;)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    that seems to be my motto as well. My husband says, &quot;it seems like every<br/>
time I follow you &#39;just to see what&#39;s there&#39;, we die.&quot; And it&#39;s been true<br/>
almost every time..... (how does that saying go, &quot;curiosity killed the cat.&quot;<br/>
*grin*)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;please also submit a suggestion for the term to describe&gt; playing two<br/>
 </span></blockquote>songs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;at once (don&#39;t say &#39;twisting&#39; &lt;g&gt;):<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    In one of these emails I read where someone called it &quot;weaving&quot;. I like<br/>
that term myself, and have started using it as such. If they had dark elf<br/>
bards, and I played one, then maybe you could classify it as &quot;twisting&quot;<br/>
hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
Weapon info??:<br/>
    Don&#39;t have a dragoon dirk yet, and havn&#39;t seen one either. But, I&#39;m only<br/>
L10. Right now I&#39;m using a Tentacle Whip and I love the &quot;Lifetap&quot; effect...<br/>
it always seems to kick in just when I need it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and tell us what in your &#39;bio&#39; screen when ppl inspect your equipment:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Brangwen, Bard of Light, wife to Callais of New OutRiders &quot;Joy to you<br/>
all&quot; (I think that&#39;s what it says, or something close to that.) I&#39;m planning<br/>
on changing it soon as I found something better in a book I&#39;ve been reading.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As far as binding goes:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Depends on where I am, but if I ride the boat to Freeport, Callais (the<br/>
enchanter husband), binds me there. If I go back to Faydwer, then I&#39;m<br/>
usually partying with Callais (the druid husband), then I must find someone<br/>
to help me. (hmmm... is poligamy legal on Norrath?? hehehe). Anyway, I&#39;ve<br/>
never had a problem thus far, especially in Greater Faydark... there are<br/>
always people willing to help and I or Callaiss try to give them something<br/>
for their help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Twinking:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I, too, started out as a twinked bard. My husband is in the guild &quot;New<br/>
OutRiders&quot; and, thus, has many higher level friends. He was able, with help<br/>
of the nice people in the guild, to procure some armor for me.... When I<br/>
first started this character he gave me some leather armor, which helped a<br/>
lot, and I was careful to not die very much. The leather is the twinked<br/>
part - we paid for the procured items with hard earned Norrath money.<br/>
    AS FOR twinking (or whatever the heck it&#39;s called).... I don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem with it, in that your characters are each separate &quot;people&quot; in the<br/>
world of Norrath, so.... it would be like me giving something to someone<br/>
else who I didn&#39;t control. Just because I am the one who plays both doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m making myself clear, but each character<br/>
being a separate entity; why can&#39;t one give something to another....<br/>
<br/>
    Although we&#39;ve had the game for a while, I have only recently been able<br/>
to play a lot (we just got a cable modem with two ip&#39;s so we can both get on<br/>
at the same time, and, of course, had to purchase a second game for my<br/>
computer). Anyway, most nights we sit in the computer room playing and<br/>
&quot;smiting&quot; evil and, in general, having a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting, all!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;may your feet be swift, your hunt be plentiful, and your songs be<br/>
melodious&quot;<br/>
