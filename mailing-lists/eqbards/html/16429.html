<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939170172">I&#39;m convinced that hugging the wall on a long fall can save you some damage.<br/>
A couple weeks ago I was running naked (CR - had drum, nothing else) down<br/>
the EK ramp from Highpass , not paying enough attention while I typed to a<br/>
friend, and fell off one of the steepest parts of the ramp with straight<br/>
walls. Miraculously, I lived. Like Crier, I ran against the wall all the way<br/>
down. I fell for, I swear, 10 seconds, but took less than 200HP damage.<br/>
Again, I was wearing no armor t&#39;all. I greeted the lady tailor NPC that<br/>
hangs out in the canyon (never knew she was there) and continued on my merry<br/>
way. Thank you, safe fall, and thank you, first person shooter reflexes! =D<br/>

<br/>
When we do Innoruuk we all fight in a corner with our backs to the wall.<br/>
Innoruuk is happy to face us.  In this position his gravity flux doesn&#39;t<br/>
throw us out the door and potentially bring trains of mobs back.  When I&#39;m<br/>
gravity fluxed I turn and run against the wall as I come down (old Quake<br/>
reflexed kicking in).  Their does appear to be some slowing of the fall<br/>
cause by my friction against the wall.  I have not died to a gflux since<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing that trick.  *shrug*  Could be just luck.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve yet to resist Innoruk&#39;s gravity flux, but for some reason<br/>
&gt; high MR seems to decrease the damage you take from it.  The<br/>
&gt; first time I fought him, I got tossed 3-4 times before my hp<br/>
&gt; bar ever showed any white.<br/>
