<b>Subject:</b> Re: EXP loss for dying <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418240304">Well, I can unfortunately provide some recent first-hand information on this <br/>
topic.  I died 3 times 2 nights ago at 35 (lousy %^#$ pickup groups with no <br/>
tactical sense and hyperactive pullers... grrr...), and each time I lost <br/>
perhaps 1/6 of a bubble.  EXP resses from lvl 50 clerics restored me to <br/>
pretty much where I was before dying - as far as I could see I regained all <br/>
my exp, but then the bar was moving very little, so it&#39;s hard to say.<br/>
<br/>
Then last night I dinged into 36 and subsequently died twice in SolB (once <br/>
when the server crashed and I returned to find myself in sonic bat central - <br/>
I never again want to see the words &quot;There is one player in Nagafen&#39;s lair&quot; <br/>
- but at least my mongo train of 10+ kobolds didn&#39;t kill anyone else but me <br/>
as I fled).  Each time when I died at 36 I lost about 2/3 bubble, and the <br/>
exp res only restored about 1/3 bubble.<br/>
<br/>
My theory is this: there is a set amount of experience lost in a death, <br/>
which appears to vary (I have noticed this many many times, I die too much) <br/>
based on the difficulty con of the monster killing me.  In hell levels (30, <br/>
35, 40, 45), the bars are effectively twice as long, so the bar moves half <br/>
as far when you die, and since my normal exp loss is around 1/3 bubble, when <br/>
I die in hell levels I lose about 1/6 bubble.  When I die in hell +1 levels <br/>
(31 and 36 so far, hoping not to experience dying in the others) I lose <br/>
about twice as much exp as normal, or 2/3 bubble.  When exp ressed by a 50 <br/>
cleric, ~90% of that *standard* exp loss is restored - meaning when you die <br/>
in hell +1 levels you regain 90% of 1/3 bubble, NOT 90% of 2/3 bubble.<br/>
<br/>
As John has pointed out, the bubbles are very misleading due to rounding <br/>
errors in displaying the data, so your results may vary.<br/>
