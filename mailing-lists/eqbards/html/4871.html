<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195802901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Since you have a 770 (TNT2, right?), can I ask what card you<br/>
&gt; had before, and how you feel about the performance of the 770?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking of upgrading from my Voodoo3 to a TNT2 card.  <br/>
&gt; The V3 speed is very nice, but the color banding is obvious<br/>
&gt; and I think it&#39;s a bit slow with the heavy spell effects.  The<br/>
&gt; spell effects don&#39;t seem to lag the card as badly in glide<br/>
&gt; mode, but framerate is a bit slower and the banding is even<br/>
&gt; worse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a hercules dynamite TNT2 ultra, and I&#39;m VERY happy with it. of the<br/>
tnt2 cards, i believe it&#39;s the most expensive, but it also has the highest<br/>
clock speeds. The picture quality is gorgeous, and everquest runs like a<br/>
dream. <br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;problem&quot; is the lack of glide support, which isn&#39;t really an<br/>
issue with EQ (i tried playing with my voodoo2 in glide, and switched back<br/>
to the tnt2 because i liked it better), although it&#39;s preventing me from<br/>
playing Tribes (unless their opengl is finally ready). The days of<br/>
glide-only games seems to be over, so i&#39;m not really too bothered by it.</div>
