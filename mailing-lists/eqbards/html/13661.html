&gt; Also, dispite what GZ said about pixie strike not being broken, it looks<br/>
&gt; like they may have changed it recently. Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>
&gt; druid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>
&gt; basically locked me up with pixie strike. I wasn&#39;t able to move once if<br/>
&gt; I got the message and icon. This is considerably different from my tests<br/>
&gt; with the song months ago.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Once you get a successful PS in, subsequent Strikes only have<br/>
to pass the initial resist check to stick.  i.e. If a mob is<br/>
beating on you and you get either a resist message or the new<br/>
&quot;mob has resisted...&quot; message, it will keep beating on you.  <br/>
But once you get it to stop beating on you, even a &quot;mob has<br/>
resisted...&quot; message will refresh the Strike.  So if the bard<br/>
gets lucky and the first Strike gets through, it&#39;s pretty much<br/>
smooth sailing from then on.  At least until the mob breaks<br/>
out of the mez early.<br/>
