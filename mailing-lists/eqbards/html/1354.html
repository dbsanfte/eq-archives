&gt; The main reason I don&#39;t advocate increasing Str is based on some Monk<br/>
&gt; research that seems to confirm that increased weight regardless of str<br/>
&gt; adversely affects the dodge skill to a great degree.  therefore wearing the<br/>
&gt; best lightest armor may help you totally avoid a blow that would otherwise<br/>
&gt; hit you for reduced damage in heavier armor.<br/>

are other rules that apply only to monks, like whether magical gloves makes<br/>
their hand to hand attacks magical.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does weight matter for a monk&#39;s dodging ability, but their actual AC<br/>
will change depending on their weight.  You can actually see this happen as you<br/>
add and remove items from their inventory.  Since THAT change does not happen<br/>
with a bard, I think it is monk only.  From that, my guess is that the dodge<br/>
percentage based on weight may be a monk-only thing as well.<br/>
