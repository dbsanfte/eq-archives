<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-338529873">I used this song in KC last night in the DrolvargCaptain room. My party<br/>
consisted of:<br/>
<br/>
50 Cleric<br/>
55 Paladin<br/>
54 Warrior<br/>
53 Wizard<br/>
51 Shaman<br/>
52 Bard<br/>
<br/>
I twisted SoS, VoV and Largo&#39;s (51 version) on single pulls, Charm and SoS<br/>
on double pulls, and if there were 3 or more, I used Pixie Strike.  I was<br/>
wielding a Sainy&#39;s Claw and SSOY in the offhand.<br/>
<br/>
What the cleric IMMEDIATELY noticed was that the warrior (he always got the<br/>
taunt) was taking far less damage on single pulls...so much less that many<br/>
times the cleric would not have to heal the warrior but once every two to<br/>
three pulls with a superior heal.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever there was a double pull, I would charm the second, and sing SoS<br/>
till the charm wore off.  The nice thing about this is that I would take<br/>
alot less damage when the recently charmed creature would express his<br/>
frustration by beating the crap out of me, and I would have a better chance<br/>
of recharming since there was less of a chance i was stunned etc.<br/>
<br/>
The most effective twist of this song - one pulse of VoV and then two pulses<br/>
of SoS ... I only used Largo&#39;s when the critters were getting low on health<br/>
to keep them from running.<br/>
<br/>
The upside:<br/>
<br/>
Overall result was that the cleric ended most fights with 70% mana or so<br/>
versus 40% after each fight most of the time, and during fights when I had<br/>
to charm creatures...rather than getting the crap beaten out of me between<br/>
charms...i just took some damage, not too much.<br/>
<br/>
The downside:<br/>
<br/>
This should be called Spam-o-Matic.  You get very tired of seeing six shield<br/>
messages fly by each pulse, and the annoying sound every single time.<br/>
<br/>
The speculation:<br/>
<br/>
I think that when you have to go invis in an area with light greens that can<br/>
kill you anyway (Mines of Droga, Sol A etc) keep this song memmed.  I<br/>
believe the absorption shield mixed with fear might be enough to keep you<br/>
alive to the zone if your invis drops.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that this song twisted with the new Jonathon&#39;s line will allow<br/>
us to tank even more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two copper pieces....<br/>
