<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726819672">While you are in lower guk (the ruins of old guk) or SolB (Nagafen&#39;s Lair)<br/>
you may as well unmemorize your invis song and use it for something else.<br/>
Same goes for Selo&#39;s Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself faced with new and interesting choices in these underground<br/>
dungeons where Selo&#39;s does not work, since I have always used a memorization<br/>
slot for it since the day I got it...now its funny to drop that song and<br/>
come up with something else useful to replace it while in these places.<br/>

&gt;    I was in Lower Guk just last night... at least I thought <br/>
&gt; it was. It was <br/>
&gt; my first time down there. As I finished zoning, it said &#39;You <br/>
&gt; have entered <br/>
&gt; old ruins of guk. (is that lower guk?)<br/>
&gt;    I zoned in as a higher level dude was slaying a shin ghoul <br/>
&gt; knight; the <br/>
&gt; very mob (one of) from which I need to loot a lambent quest <br/>
&gt; item. I had my <br/>
&gt; invis song going as per usual. All through upper I noticed <br/>
&gt; that everything <br/>
&gt; was indifferent to me. YAY! Ok, song is working like a charm. <br/>
&gt; I did manage <br/>
&gt; to con the shin ghoul knight while he was being attacked. &quot;A <br/>
&gt; Shin Ghoul <br/>
&gt; Knight scowls at you, ready to attack. What would you like <br/>
&gt; your tombstone to <br/>
&gt; say?&quot; Um ok, first reaction is to zone, especially since he <br/>
&gt; was just inches <br/>
&gt; away  from me. The guy was using the zone line as a buffer, <br/>
&gt; apparently. NP. <br/>
&gt; Zoned... Went LD... That&#39;s where I am as it stands.<br/>
&gt;    So, at 19 so far, from what I think is lower (?), can see <br/>
&gt; through invis. <br/>
&gt; Now, whether or not your invis ability increases as you level <br/>
&gt; or not, is <br/>
&gt; something i know zero about.<br/>
&gt;    All I know is I was happy to get invis so I can get down <br/>
&gt; to lower guk to <br/>
&gt; get these items (shin greaves and gauntlets) before i had a <br/>
&gt; chance to either <br/>
&gt; go hunt there for exp, or get some faction hits somewhere else.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hmmm, I will have to give this a try in Lower Guk.  I really <br/>
&gt; need to learn <br/>
&gt; &gt;that place better.<br/>
