<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752231664">When charm breaks, they *all* come after you.  Just stay out of the swarm,<br/>
and finish off the last little bit of health on your (now ex) pet.  I think<br/>
you can bellow kite to finish it off, at those levels...I can&#39;t really<br/>
remember offhand the songs at that level, and can&#39;t look right now.  Just<br/>
use whatever you have to finish it off, should be easy to figure out the<br/>
best way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
No bard songs ever work on pets.  Yours or anyone elses.<br/>
