<div id="ygrps-yiv-342476417">it&#39;s under options, display.  towards the bottom it says screens same<br/>
resolution or something like that.  i can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
on or off, but when i switch to inventory i stay on 1024x768, it&#39;s just<br/>
smaller.  it doesn&#39;t switch to 640x480 and my monitor take forever to switch<br/>
resses.<br/>
