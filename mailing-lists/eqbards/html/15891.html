&gt; Seriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>
&gt; loot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>
&gt; it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>

dragon/planes runs you&#39;ve been on and gives higher preference<br/>
to people who&#39;ve been on more and haven&#39;t gotten items.  So if<br/>
you really wanted a RBB, you could simply decline loot until<br/>
you&#39;d amassed more points than anyone else, then when it came<br/>
up it&#39;d be yours.  Unfortunately, it only really works with a<br/>
closed group, like a tight-knit guild.<br/>
