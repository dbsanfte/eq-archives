&gt; &gt; Oh - anyone else notice buffs not lasting as long either?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah. And it&#39;s not just me either, most in my guild have commented on the<br/>
&gt; same thing! I&#39;ve also noticed some of my songs effects aren&#39;t lasting as<br/>
&gt; long so I have to fire them up in my medley of songs (some call it juggling)<br/>
&gt; sooner than before.... What&#39;s up with that??? Any ideas??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had the same problem, but I pegged it on my 290ms ping (up<br/>
from the usual 130ms) and 10% PL (up from 0%).  After<br/>
suffering with this atrocious connection for 2 weeks, last<br/>
night was back to normal and I didn&#39;t notice anything<br/>
different with song durations.  I did have a problem with my<br/>
timing - I think I&#39;m sensing about an extra 1/10th second of<br/>
delay between when I hit a key/click a button and when the<br/>
action is reflected.  Maybe they added some more client-side<br/>
processing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can upgrade to a faster machine...  :)<br/>
