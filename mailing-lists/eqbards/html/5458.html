&gt;them? Odd. Ok, this is where I admittedly made a really bad use of common<br/>
&gt;sense. Instead of making a wide path around them, I figured since they were<br/>
&gt;amiable to me I could just run right by and wave as I did it. After all,<br/>
&gt;they like me right?<br/>

&gt;I didn&#39;t see who hit me. I didn&#39;t see what damage they did. I was simply<br/>
&gt;slain. No dropping of the health bar. Just slain.<br/>

&gt;Threateningly. How rude. Oh well, no time to ask him what his problem is,<br/>
&gt;gotta get my corpse. I inch my way down while bashing on my /corpse hot key<br/>
&gt;when all the sudden the Ogre&#39;s notice me. Without thinking I turned and ran<br/>
&gt;hoping maybe I&#39;d just lead them far enough away then go in a circle back to<br/>
&gt;the temple and /corpse my body along to the zone border or something. How<br/>
&gt;fast can big Ogre&#39;s run anyway? Took a little damage this time, but still<br/>
&gt;alive and running. Hit F9 a couple times to see how far behind me they are<br/>
&gt;and notice something.. &quot;Chief Dooga&#39;s Pet&quot; is on my tail - and closing fast.<br/>
&gt;What an Ogre has a wolf for, I don&#39;t know. I run fast..<br/>

impatient waiting for you in Halas.<br/>
The problem that you ran into with the ogres is that there are a total of 5<br/>
ogres there.  Tow Oger Guards both about level 20 Shadow Knights.  2 Oger<br/>
Shamen also about level 20.  The 5th one is Chief Dooga, who just so<br/>
happens to be about a level 30 Shadow Knight.  Occasionally a level 30<br/>
Female ogre shamen will spawn there as well.<br/>
All the ogres except the chief won&#39;t bother you (untill you kill them<br/>
enough times) however if the Chief sees you he will order his troups to<br/>
attack.  You died so fast each time because:<br/>
1. All the ogre&#39;s are sowed due to the shamen<br/>
2. You probably got hit with about 700 damage in harm touches from the 2<br/>
level 20s and the one level 30 Shadow Knight.<br/>
3.  The wolf pet probably belonged to the rare female ogre shamen.<br/>
<br/>
Again sorry to hear about the death, but I did like the story.  Same kind<br/>
of thing happened to me at the brownie village in Lesser Faydark.  My<br/>
screen filled up with debuff spells and then I died a moment later.<br/>
Unfortunately for me I didn&#39;t know at the time you could use invis and the<br/>
/corpse command, so I was left to running through the camp as fast as<br/>
possible with selos on and moving my body out inch by inch, death by death<br/>
till it was far enough away that I could loot safely.  I&#39;ve since learned<br/>
my sesson since Beta and I con everything now, even stuff that looks like<br/>
it should have been green 20 levels ago.  :)<br/>
