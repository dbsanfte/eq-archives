Nothing was more depressing than last night with my cleric twink in SK <br/>
Penthouse...  We had a bard with us that ended up getting aggroed on from <br/>
birds below.  Of course you can&#39;t attack them but they can certainly attack <br/>
you.  So he decides to run to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make it.  His drum was useless.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know HOW to travel with my bard without trusting in our <br/>
blinding speed.  &quot;OK, we&#39;re going to just run through this zone, do not stop<br/>
<br/>
if attacked, just keep going.  We can outrun anything.&quot;<br/>

&gt;There is nothing more ponderous than a High Elf cleric in full<br/>
&gt;bronze...except maybe a bard with broken drums...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ponderous...ponderous...<br/>
