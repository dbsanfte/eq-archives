<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576234354">I&#39;d have to totally and completely disagree.  At 10th level wisps are still<br/>
red even the monk will lose.  At 13-14 though they still provide xp, some<br/>
con blue, and a melee type with h2h maxed could beat one.  I could beat one<br/>
at 14th with just bellow and at the same time could punch normal critters<br/>
for around the same damage 7-8 points.  I would doubt that a 13th level<br/>
warrior would have trouble beating a wisp with his fists if they could hit<br/>
magical critters.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;True, but at the level you are fighting wisps for example <br/>
&gt;a cap of 100<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh I missed the lower level aspect to the story.  I thought<br/>
we were discussing higher levels.  Even at 19 when you first<br/>
start seeing your caps move to 100, H2H still is very lacking<br/>
as my 100 H2H does not beat a level 1 monk with 5 points trained<br/>
in H2H.  So even if a level 10 warrior had a 55 hand to hand and<br/>
magic fists he still wouldn&#39;t be able to beat up wisps, where<br/>
a monk of similar or lesser level could do it with little problems.  <br/>
Magic fists or not, no melee type can win with just fists, except <br/>
a monk, in the lower levels.<br/>
