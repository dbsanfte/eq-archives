<div id="ygrps-yiv-120424046">i&#39;ve found that most of the attitude problem players are either wizards or<br/>
druids.... being kill stealers or/and kiters.  And my personnal favorite top<br/>
hated is Barbarian shamans, i&#39;ve only met one nice one of them so far.  And<br/>
i agree,  when i had my newbie troll i found that most of the trolls and<br/>
ogres i met were very friendly, then again, most newbies are as they havent<br/>
been exposed to kill stealing dungeons yet where they lose their innocence. <br/>

&gt; &gt;OK time for a new wrinkle on the stalker issue, have any of you who play <br/>
&gt; &gt;female characters noticed a trend in the race of the stalkers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever had much of a problem with stalkers.  Had one high <br/>
&gt; elf try it once with my wood elf druid.  I sent him a tell that if he<br/>
&gt; didnt <br/>
&gt; stop it ASAP, i would /report him.  He apologized quickly and never I<br/>
&gt; heard <br/>
&gt; from him again.  I am female in RL, btw.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never had the problem on my wood elf bard from strangers.  Get lots of <br/>
&gt; teasing from flirting from the male members of my guild.  But since I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; known most of them for 3 RL years, its not quite the same thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I have noticed: for some reason, seems like more wood elves and <br/>
&gt; high elves have attitude problems than the other races.  Wood elf male<br/>
&gt; bards <br/>
&gt; being the worst. Of course, this is a subjective opinion.  One thing for <br/>
&gt; sure though, soon as my wood elf characters were old enough to travel, I <br/>
&gt; left Fedwyr and rarely go back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for Trolls and Ogres, I&#39;ve found them to be some of the nicest folks <br/>
&gt; you&#39;d want to be around, so long as you can overlook their disgusting <br/>
&gt; personal habits ;-P<br/>
