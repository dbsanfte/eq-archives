<div id="ygrps-yiv-679884048">Actually call me crazy but juggling songs is one of the main reasons I enjoy<br/>
playing a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Every other class I&#39;ve played, I get exceptionally bored during a fight.  As<br/>
you&#39;re either waiting to cast, or waiting for kick/etc to recycle just to<br/>
hit it again.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas with a bard, I&#39;m constantly doing something, not to mention making<br/>
fast decisions like switch out weapons to instruments, or should I cycle in<br/>
a different song because of some change in the combat.  Even after combat,<br/>
I&#39;m still juggling hymn & clarity to minimize down time.  I&#39;d much rather be<br/>
doing that than staring at a spell book.<br/>

&gt;&gt; philosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that<br/>
&gt;&gt; this change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Actually, though probably not something easily coded into the game,<br/>
&gt;this is a great idea to reduce the twitch-a-mania bards face. Heck,<br/>
&gt;nowadays when I am away from computer, I can see in my MIND the<br/>
&gt;damn hotbuttons (2 and 3, I always keep selo and hymn there) and<br/>
&gt;whenever I see people moving around or myself am walking, I am<br/>
&gt;mentally pressing the 2-key. I can see it depress, and soon flashy<br/>
&gt;balls around and thinking of moving faster =P I would not say I am<br/>
&gt;addicted, I would say the damn keypressing has burned into my head!<br/>
&gt;Though my gf probably has other notions about me not being addicted...<br/>
&gt;Now to think of it.. just yesterday left her place at 11pm to go home and<br/>
&gt;play instead of staying over (to you-know-what), so OK I am addicted.<br/>
&gt;A bit.. not much.. just a bit =P<br/>
