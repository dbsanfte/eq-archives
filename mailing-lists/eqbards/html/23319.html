 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s the whole point.  you can be flexible and use the other class abilities to<br/>
help make up for the short healing.  with the shaman you not only have slow,<br/>
you have talisman to give you a bigger buffer, you have regen/chloro/regrowth,<br/>
you have slow, and the straight heal.  a druid can help end the battle sooner so<br/>
that you don&#39;t have as much healing that needs to be done, fairly efficient dd,<br/>
good dots, regen/chloro/regrowth, damage shields, and the straight heal.  if you<br/>
have a wizard and rogue in the group dealing fast damage you&#39;ll kill the mob<br/>
before it has a chance to do too much damage.  and with a bard (the constant<br/>
i am assuming since this is a bard list) if there&#39;s 3 or fewer mobs, you can always<br/>
pause the fight with mez and let the druid med and the tanks heal (with only 1 or 2<br/>
i can twist 2 or 1 heal song/s in along with the mez).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I WAS four blue bubs away from 53 - but due to an un-rez&#39;d death (long story<br/>
&gt;involving my own stupidity...) I&#39;m not back to five - so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
&gt;to 53.  I&#39;m in a small guild where we have a core group of people around<br/>
&gt;47-51.  We do have a 54 cleric but he is either rarely on - or on alternates<br/>
&gt;not in guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The core group in addition to me is Four Druids between 46-53; two 49/51<br/>
&gt;Paladins; and a 49 Ranger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Two questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Do you all think that a Bard/Druid/Paladin group can handle the &quot;hard&quot;<br/>
&gt;areas?  What minimum levels should my partners be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you should be able to if you do the pulling.  the paladin can chain stun which<br/>
helps a LOT.  the key is to not get damaged too much on the pull which would<br/>
put the druid at a big disadvantage right from the start.  if you can, pick up a<br/>
shaman, they really help more than most people think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Any advise on where to go &quot;practice&quot; my crowd control skills and the<br/>
&gt;groups efforts in general without worry about group wipes?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
&gt;Chardok zone-out.  On Xegony it&#39;s usually pretty empty and you can hunt at<br/>
&gt;the zone out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>depends on what skills you want to practice.  if it&#39;s targetting, then you can go anywhere,<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter if mobs are green or blue or whatever.  doesn&#39;t even have to be in<br/>
a dungeon.  if you want to practice positioning, go to lower guk, frenzy/lord/king, and tell<br/>
your puller to bring 3 or 4 back instead of just one.  plus you&#39;ll still get pretty good experience<br/>
and the mobs are much easier than the equally levelled mobs in karnors.<br/>
