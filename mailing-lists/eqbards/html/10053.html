<div id="ygrps-yiv-131352369"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; But I don&#39;t want to stop surfing, does anyone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I suppose I&#39;m going to be the devil&#39;s advocate here... but I&#39;ve always<br/>
hated the surfing thing.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why is because it is so obviously a bug. Firstly, it isn&#39;t a<br/>
floating song... there is no reason why we should float. (If you were<br/>
levitated then it would be cool...) Secondly, it isn&#39;t like you surf all the<br/>
time... only when the animation runs. So it is very obvious that they just<br/>
forgot or didn&#39;t have time to create the running and playing animation.<br/>
<br/>
I like to immerse myself in the game and really get into it... and every<br/>
time I see a bard running then start to play and start floating... it just<br/>
makes me think this is a buggy, half-finished game.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait til they fix it! :)<br/>
