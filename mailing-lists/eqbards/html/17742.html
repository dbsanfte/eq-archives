There is a goblin Camp North of the chessboard.  A<br/>
15th lvl pet will kill them in no time but they should<br/>
keep the pet occupied long enough for you to go back<br/>
and melee the mage a bit.<br/>
<br/>
...and borrow a thulian claw or something really fast<br/>
from the genius who matched you up with a con-red<br/>
opponent. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also work overtime to make 12th lvl, which you can<br/>
easily do at the chessboard, but a quick place is the<br/>
Derv Camp in West Commons...you might even make 13 by<br/>
then.  You are still at a disadvantage but at least<br/>
you would have bellow as an extra tool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If the pet roots you and you are singing Selo&#39;s you<br/>
can usually break root the next round...<br/>
<br/>
good luck...even if you don&#39;t win, make sure your<br/>
opponent knows he was in a fight!<br/>
