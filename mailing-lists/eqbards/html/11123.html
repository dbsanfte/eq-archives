<b>Subject:</b> An idea for one of our missing song slots <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-379854500">Ok, Verant is at a loss as to how to fill in our slots - and the upcoming<br/>
additions don&#39;t seem to hold much hope of anything &#39;new&#39;. Lets look at what<br/>
we do, and how we do it...hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Any competent bard twists/weaves (insert your favorite teminology for it<br/>
here) songs. This results in constant button mashing (twitching) in a non<br/>
twitch game. I love my bard, I love what we do - I don&#39;t like constantly<br/>
mashing buttons. Same reason I don&#39;t like having to switch out<br/>
weapons/instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the slots we are missing could be something we ourselves could<br/>
write - out of what we already have.<br/>
<br/>
Say, the first one missing is something that allows 2 or 3 songs to be<br/>
scribed together - with the bard deciding, ok...I want Hymn one bar, X song<br/>
for two bars, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d even go so far as to allow this to be setup time and time again, i.e.,<br/>
not permanent - there are too many situations this could be useful in - and<br/>
too much experimentation that would need to be done to write once and<br/>
forget it.<br/>
<br/>
Would this circumvent the number of songs available to us at a time?  Ummm,<br/>
not really - if a song is useful enough to put in a medly - it&#39;s probably<br/>
going to be mem&#39;d anyway - this just saves the bard some carpal tunnel.<br/>
Perhaps require that the compenents are mem&#39;d at the time - this would<br/>
actually DECREASE the number available to us, but IMHO would be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Would this overpower the class?  I don&#39;t think so - it might however even<br/>
up things for folks like me with lousy connects to the net.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY thing I dislike about the bard class is the twitch factor, in a<br/>
supposedly nontwitch game.</div>
