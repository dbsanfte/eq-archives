&gt; What do you mean it does damage? Is it like a fire shield? I just got Psalm<br/>
&gt; of Cooling and it raises protection from heat by 50-60 points, are you<br/>
&gt; saying Psalm of warmth protects from cold as well as causes damage to mobs?<br/>
&gt; I have never read this anywhere before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it puts up a damage shield - it damages anything that<br/>
hits you.  The Psalm songs also seem to have full effect when<br/>
sung, unlike the Rhythm songs which need a drum for full<br/>
effect.<br/>
