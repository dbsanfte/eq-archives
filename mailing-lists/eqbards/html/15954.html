<div id="ygrps-yiv-10785360">Yes, when I&#39;m in tight groups (where fights often get down to low<br/>
health... When its just me and a rogue, and athere are things that<br/>
jump in, this happens more often than I would like... But we<br/>
haven&#39;t died once yet. So What do you say? More fun than crocs!)<br/>
I ALWAYS use my PGT and try to keep the critter on me. The rogue<br/>
does more damage in backstabs and I can avoid taking damage<br/>
quite often using that shield, often making the difference in close<br/>
fights between winning and running.<br/>

&gt;In the groups I&#39;m usually in, ie Cleric, Shaman, and 2-3 melee types<br/>
&gt;including me, procs are very valuable.  I can&#39;t say how many times I have<br/>
&gt;been saved by the Berserker Strength shield or the extra damage from<br/>
&gt;Obsidian Shatter.  Twice last nite for sure.  Our fights last at least 2<br/>
&gt;minutes generally. </span></blockquote></div>
