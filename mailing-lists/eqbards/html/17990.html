&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now that we are getting messages when our song<br/>
&gt; effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; noticed that our snare song amost never lasts<br/>
&gt; the full duration. Many<br/>
&gt; times<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering if any of you were having the<br/>
&gt; same problem and whether<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not this is by design or a bug that we should<br/>
&gt; bring to the attention of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; powers that be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have been having the problem for 2-3 months now (maybe<br/>
longer).  It all seemed to start happening when I<br/>
first entered sol b.  I&#39;d chain the kobolds and they&#39;d<br/>
run off.  As I&#39;m trying to recast I get about 6<br/>
resists in a row.  It is really unreliable.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know whether it is certain mobs that are causing<br/>
trouble or not.  I now let the rangers snare--I&#39;ve<br/>
been playing around with Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>
instead for the slowdown attack.  Whether Chains got<br/>
bugged about that time or whether it is just the<br/>
certain mobs, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; What level are you and what mobs are you using it<br/>
&gt; on?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; found it no less reliable in duration than our<br/>
&gt; charm/fear/mez<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hehe, I mentioned that I had EXTREMELY unpredictable<br/>
&gt; results with chains and<br/>
&gt; that is NEVER stuck for the full duration a couple<br/>
&gt; weeks ago and practically<br/>
&gt; got flamed out of this egroup :).  Talk about an<br/>
&gt; uber-thread (started with<br/>
&gt; something about lazy snarers).<br/>
