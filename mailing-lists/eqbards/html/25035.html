<br/>
Ok, here&#39;s what i&#39;ve found about ME working with it as a computer technician<br/>
since it came out...<br/>
<br/>
One: only put it on machines with &#39;top of the line&#39; hardware...<br/>
Substandard drivers, such as come with &#39;generic&#39; hardware seem to cause all<br/>
sorts of problems.<br/>
If you are using &#39;name-brand&#39; hardware, and keep drivers updated to ME<br/>
compatible, you won&#39;t have too many problems.<br/>
<br/>
Two: Only use &#39;name brand&#39; memory.  Yeah, I know you can go out on the web<br/>
and buy that stick of pc-100 128 mb of ram for 1/3 of what CompUSA or<br/>
whoever charges, but there is a reason for that...<br/>
If you are gonna get new memory, don&#39;t be cheap and go ahead and get<br/>
Kingston or VisionTek or such. Yeah, it&#39;ll cost you a bit more in the short<br/>
term, but it&#39;ll make you alot happier in the long run.  (Compaq and HP both<br/>
use Kingston, or used to, even though it&#39;s labeled as Compaq or HP).<br/>
<br/>
Three: Nortons/McAffee/Other &#39;Suites&#39; and ME just don&#39;t get along at all...<br/>
Run Norton AntiVirus, McAffee Antivirus, etc., but DON&#39;T run the entire<br/>
suites, you will cause more problems than you will solve. (Especially the<br/>
&#39;anti-crash&#39; applications - you will blue screen more often than the<br/>
software will save you).<br/>
<br/>
My wife&#39;s machine has been running ME since it was released, it&#39;s a Compaq<br/>
w/ some upgraded parts (used to be my old EQ machine) and it hasn&#39;t crashed<br/>
since it was loaded, and it runs 24/7 for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
My machine is home-built, and I&#39;ve only put in the best parts I could put my<br/>
hands on, i.e. SB Live, Hercules GEForce, Adaptec SCSI, Maxtor HDD (40GB<br/>
UDMA 100), and NAME BRAND MEMORY.  I crash, but that&#39;s because I have who<br/>
knows what loaded on my system...I run every game I come across, beta&#39;s,<br/>
demo&#39;s, etc. etc. etc., and usually the crashes are from some of that, and<br/>
they aren&#39;t real common.<br/>
