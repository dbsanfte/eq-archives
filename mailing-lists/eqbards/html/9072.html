<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what explains this?<br/>
&gt; Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just <br/>
&gt; watching, &quot;An orc <br/>
&gt; oracle begins to cast a spell.  You feel drowsy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In the middle of combat with a whole other party!  That&#39;s Bard Hate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well.. again I can only comment based on personal experience, and this has<br/>
never happened to me.  The only alternative is that it&#39;s hard coded into the<br/>
program, which I find completely illogical - and again, if that&#39;s the case<br/>
it would have happened to me by now (one would think).  Please don&#39;t think<br/>
that this means I&#39;m implying that what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t true... I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t dare! :)<br/>
<br/>
With that being said, I remove myself from this discussion - which as far as<br/>
I can tell has no resulotion in sight.<br/>
