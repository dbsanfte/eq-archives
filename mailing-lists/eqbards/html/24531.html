&gt;And is it just me, or do the EQ Kerrans look an awful lot like the SWO<br/>
&gt;Bothans?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Who said those were the Kerrans?  From what I understand, the Kerrans are <br/>
the cat people on Kerra Isle.  The creatures in the screenshots could very <br/>
well be just NPC&#39;s, like the Coldain dwarves in Velious.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t think that the current player models will be any different or <br/>
better than what they are now, unless you count new armor (which would <br/>
really only be a new skin, not a new model).  If you remember Velious and <br/>
even Kunark have NPC&#39;s that are much more detailed than old world Norrath...<br/>
