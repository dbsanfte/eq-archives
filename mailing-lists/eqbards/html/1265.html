<div id="ygrps-yiv-5191871">Greetings, I&#39;m new to the list (and fairly new to EQ, not counting a stint in P4)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 8 bard on Povar, nearing 9, and using both a rapier and a short sword, keeping my skills maxxed out. Mainly because I couldn&#39;t decide which one to use, so I decided to use both.<br/>
<br/>
But... since I set my strength to a low 75, I&#39;m not much for melee, even while twisting Chant and the Warsong. 110 dexterity means I don&#39;t get hit often though. And now that I can use instruments, my biggest strength seems to be my songs (well, obviously. But very markedly different comared to my poor melee)<br/>
<br/>
My question, how much more effective will training Hand to Hand make me while wielding an instrument? I&#39;d like to be able to help out a bit.. Right now I&#39;m holding my lute, playing Hymn of Restoration, and punching jackals, pumas, and orcs to death in Northern Ro, and have reached 26 total skill in Hand to Hand.<br/>
<br/>
And to go along with that, what exactly does increased skill do? Is it purely chance-to-hit, or does it increase damage as well?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Cypress, Povar</div>
