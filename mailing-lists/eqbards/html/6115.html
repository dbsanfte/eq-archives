<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851137174">If it makes you feel any better i&#39;ve died 3 times in lev 30 and have been in<br/>
it for over 3 weeks now, going on my 4th week. Its so depressing, this whole<br/>
level i&#39;ve made enough money to buy full steel plate by killing giants, even<br/>
got a box of aku-bar.  While i had almost caught up to most of my group when<br/>
i hit 30, they&#39;ve all jumped ahead and are now all 37-40.  If im lucky i<br/>
might level tonight or tomorrow and get out of my first hell level.  I even<br/>
made a few low lev chars to change my train of thoughts to get away from the<br/>
depressing feeling of 30.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 25 is a mini-hell.  Most people don&#39;t notice it, but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; estimate it took me about 70% longer to get through it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ack say it isn&#39;t so =(.  I dinna want it to be so.  THough I think it is<br/>
&gt; noticable in Unrest since the mobs are mostly blue to me now.  Perhaps 25<br/>
&gt; is one of those inbetween levels where most things are green or even =(.<br/>
&gt; Time to check Mistmoore then.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>
&gt; &gt; level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>
&gt; &gt; back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>
&gt; &gt; a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell-levels + 1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ack, now I am getting depressed my friend.  I was so happy to have cleared<br/>
&gt; leel 24 with only one death.  As my friends know well I am way to big on<br/>
&gt; the honour and chivalry bit and hence forth I die way too often<br/>
&gt; helping/saving friends.  Oh well I guess I will be one of those  bards who<br/>
&gt; will congratulated 20-30 times for getting my level 30 =).  Anyone know a <br/>
&gt; pretty cleric who would be willing to marry a bard who is proone to dying<br/>
&gt; and causing trains?  ... ANy takers?... I guess not =)<br/>
