<div id="ygrps-yiv-530573481">Umm actually, Kit, if you page back several months, I&#39;ve been saying that<br/>
all along.  Bard Melee is pathetic after level 20, when all the other<br/>
Hybrids get double attack.  After 20th level we start to get really dusted<br/>
in melee ability.  After 16th they start to dust us in defensive as well so<br/>
by level 22 or so we are horrendously behind the power curve melee wise.<br/>
<br/>
Bard = Caster in Plate, just like a cleric, with slightly better offense<br/>
skill and a slightly higher dodge cap.<br/>
<br/>
Actually Cleric is a VERY good comparison, melee power wise, to a bard.<br/>
Except that they only get 4 points per level for OFFENSE and DEFENSE and we<br/>
get 5.  And their Dodge, I believe, is capped at 75<br/>
<br/>
Basically a Bard is a Caster with pretentions at being melee.<br/>
<br/>
Any bard who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves.  And I&#39;ve been saying<br/>
that since beta.<br/>

&gt; It is interesting to see that when I long ago argued that our melee skills<br/>
&gt; were only barely superior to that of shamans there were many who argued<br/>
&gt; vehemently that we were far better at melee.  It seems now that more bards<br/>
&gt; are beginning to agree that our melee skills are not far beyond those of<br/>
&gt; some of the &quot;pure&quot; casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kit<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually his statement is exactly right.  Our Melee skills are hardly our<br/>
&gt; defining trait.  Being only barely a notch above shaman and druids in our<br/>
&gt; melee ability.  Sure we get dual wield but they can wield 2h blunt<br/>
weapons.<br/>
&gt; So we&#39;re better at melee, but not near on par with the &#39;true&#39; melee<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; that get dual wield and double attack or just double attack but can wield<br/>
&gt; 2hs weapons or 1hs and use a shield to bash.  Either way, any of the real<br/>
&gt; melee classes are &quot;defined&quot; by their melee skills.  We are &quot;defined&quot; by<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; ability to sing songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (and almost any bard will tell you that our songs are far more powerful<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; our melee ability)<br/>
