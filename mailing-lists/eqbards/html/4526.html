&gt; The canoes are even more buggy than the regular ships. It&#39;s really horrid. A<br/>
&gt; Bard friend of mine and I were taking a canoe from Erollisi to Sister Isles<br/>
&gt; and neither of us could see each other. I&#39;d constantly be checking my LOC<br/>
&gt; (he was navigating the boat) and I wasn&#39;t moving. Our LOC&#39;s wouldn&#39;t match<br/>
&gt; up (not even close). He&#39;d get to land and I&#39;d still see myself and the boat<br/>
&gt; out in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight. Then all the sudden,<br/>
&gt; *poof*. I&#39;m on land.<br/>

on the same canoe (I was piloting) and he asked why we were<br/>
going in circles. I switched to an external view and he wasn&#39;t<br/>
on the canoe.  He said *I* wasn&#39;t on the canoe.  I headed back<br/>
to where we&#39;d left the dock.  He said the canoe was moving<br/>
straight now.  Shortly afterwards, the canoe literally<br/>
disappeared from underneath me and I was dumped into the<br/>
water.  Everything looked odd and eventually I figured out I<br/>
was in the water *under* the land.  I swam towards the &quot;shore&quot;<br/>
and popped up on top of dry land.<br/>

big one, not a canoe) to cross.  If you swim after the boat,<br/>
you will hit the invisible wall while the boat continues on,<br/>
makes a turn, then zones.<br/>
