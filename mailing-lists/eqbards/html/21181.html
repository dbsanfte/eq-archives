<div id="ygrps-yiv-380477941">I&#39;ve tweaked mine out to where I&#39;m very comfortable with it.  You can get it at www.clandlc.com/files/eqclient.ini <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of pastels and light colors in this one, that&#39;s because I play in full screen mode and most&#39;ve the places I play in are dark.  It&#39;s hard to read some of the text in windowed mode, but the text that you have to read in that mode is black (Merchant buy/sells).  I&#39;ve found that in the zones that are lighter or foggy zones (like Burning Woods sometimes), all you have to do to read the text again is toggle on the Transparent Polys (~ key).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know what some of you all think (and if you have color suggestions, please tell me).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, anyone else notice their text disappearing when changing from windowed to full-screen mode and vice versa?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;ve been tweaking mine and always seem to make it worse.  Anyone have one<br/>
out there that they are proud of?  BTW - I have an Nvidia card (Geforce2<br/>
GTS) so obviously using D3D.  I think this makes a difference since on my<br/>
old box I had a Voodoo3 2000 - and the colors somewhat different different..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
