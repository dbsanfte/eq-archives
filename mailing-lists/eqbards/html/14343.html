<b>Subject:</b> Necro balancing (was negativity) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286338032">The real reason that Necros were given the new spells was largely to make<br/>
them more viable for groups, not to compensate for pet nerfing.  Necros were<br/>
correct (whining or not) that all they did in most groups was send in the<br/>
pet and Pact of Shadows people who were low in HPs.  Their DoTs are too slow<br/>
for most situations where they&#39;re in a well-balanced group.  They needed a<br/>
boost to be more group-friendly (especially on the Planes) and I feel like<br/>
they got it (although not the Group Feign Death my friend wanted :).  Verant<br/>
has replaced the manastone with other players guys - this is a very cagey<br/>
move on their part if you ask me.  They gave magicians the ability to summon<br/>
Modulating Rods (Mod Rods) that are basically manastones, and they gave<br/>
Necros the ability to convert their own HPs to mana for someone else<br/>
<br/>
This is smart - they took a class that needed to be more valuable to a group<br/>
and gave them the ability to behave like an item that got nerfed out of the<br/>
planes and the expansion.  Whether or not we agree with the manastone nerf<br/>
is really rather irrelevant.<br/>

PS: IMO, the ultimate whiny brat fiasco was Warriors getting critical hits<br/>
and naturaly increasing MR a few months back.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; To be completely cynical for a minute, I&#39;d argue that the only way to<br/>
&gt; get results from Verant is to be a whiny brat. At least that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; impression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>
&gt; other class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>
&gt; spells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>
&gt; the necros presented their case in an adult manner. </span></blockquote></div>
