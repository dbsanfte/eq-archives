<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777429100">Definitely possible, but this was a wanderer that came up by the zone line.<br/>
Even so, the rest of the evening, nothing resisted 8 times in a row...heh.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well...I&#39;ll be back there, I&#39;ll show them.  :)<br/>

The most likely reason they are resisting charm is that they are buffing up<br/>
their MR.  Try having someone dispel them, then charm.<br/>

Fighting in Dalnir yesterday, I noticed a couple things.  First, for blues,<br/>
they all resist my charm a lot.  A LOT.  A smoldering goo resisted 8<br/>
consecutive attempts at charming.  Others would resist 3-5 times.  My<br/>
charisma is over 125, and I don&#39;t have these troubles with charm anywhere<br/>
else.  The FM giants, the yellow and evens, tend to resist 2 times, and then<br/>
only occassionally.  <br/>
<br/>
The flip side, is the xp in Dalnir.  Even in the hell level that is 30, 2<br/>
kills gives noticable movement.  :)  Just make sure you&#39;re in a good group,<br/>
even with Selos, the death run takes forever.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t pull in Dalnir.  I think there must be a bard hate multiplier in<br/>
there.  Had a druid pulling, and he brings 2 casters.  He turns the corner,<br/>
and 2 heartbeats later, they appear around the corner, stop, and begin to<br/>
cast.  Just take a wild guess at the recipient of all that DD loving.  :)<br/>
Not the puller, oh no.  It was the guy in blue who still had that weak,<br/>
level 20 manasong going.  Full health to 2 bubbles before we do any<br/>
damage...heh.  Too bad for them, the druid healed me.  I then proceeded to<br/>
buff everyones MR to high heck, and I don&#39;t think they landed anything else.<br/>
<br/>
But the second one still resisted my charm like crazy...I&#39;m baffled.  Charm<br/>
does not work in there like it does everywhere else.  But I&#39;m not leaving.<br/>
As long as you get a decent group...oh, the exp!  Hehe...<br/>
