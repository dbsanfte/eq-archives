<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343544145">*The Hole*<br/>
<br/>
We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on <br/>
the continent of Odus.  The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, <br/>
available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status.  The files <br/>
necessary to enter The Hole are available via the &quot;Optional Patch&quot; button <br/>
at the bottom of the patch program interface.  The files are quite large <br/>
(about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to <br/>
postpone downloading the files until later.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support <br/>
characters starting at about level 40.  It should be regarded as extremely <br/>
dangerous.  As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A <br/>
SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST.  The GMs will not recover corpses for people <br/>
who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole.<br/>

*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br/>
<br/>
As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying <br/>
interest in &quot;coin-only&quot; loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain <br/>
item- loot, we have implemented &quot;coin-only&quot; looting rules for PvP combat on <br/>
Vallon Zek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Resurrection*<br/>
<br/>
Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in <br/>
order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection.  Due to <br/>
the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we&#39;ve <br/>
raised this limit from two hours to three.  This should assist players and <br/>
make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection <br/>
within the time limit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Warping*<br/>
<br/>
We put in some code that should help decrease the &quot;ghosting&quot; (NPCs <br/>
appearing to be some place they aren&#39;t) being reported in some of the <br/>
larger Kunark zones.  Please let us know how this goes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Locked Doors*<br/>
<br/>
We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open <br/>
locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to <br/>
pick locks.  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of <br/>
the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through <br/>
locked doors without opening them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Vox and Nagafen*<br/>
<br/>
Over the past couple of weeks, we&#39;ve received more and more reports of <br/>
these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level <br/>
(high 50s) adventurers.  As we&#39;ve always felt that Dragons should be <br/>
special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with <br/>
some choices.<br/>
<br/>
One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a <br/>
level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging.  This would <br/>
have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who <br/>
did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, <br/>
but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon <br/>
raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when <br/>
engaged by a more powerful group of people.  This would have the undesired <br/>
effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a <br/>
dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we&#39;ve instead decided that <br/>
dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to <br/>
pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now encounter <br/>
some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these <br/>
dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their <br/>
chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much <br/>
higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of <br/>
creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the <br/>
elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br/>
