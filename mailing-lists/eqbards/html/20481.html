<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755060939">To answer your question, yes Lullaby does suck.  Basically late last year <br/>
Verant added a second resist to the song that makes it almost useless.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have the numbers, but apparently a level 50 bard with high Charisma <br/>
will have more than 40% resists on level one mobs.<br/>
<br/>
According to GZ (of Verant) it&#39;s only supposed to resist at approximately <br/>
the same level that the enchanters mez spell (which has, what, 15% resists?) <br/>
  They are supposedly &quot;looking into testing it&quot;, which they&#39;ve been saying <br/>
since March or so.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are you sure you have Bard Songs showing?  They added an option to the <br/>
client software a month or so ago that allows people to turn off the <br/>
messages and &quot;fireworks&quot; that bards produce.  I&#39;m not exactly sure, but I <br/>
think it is located in the Options-&gt;Chat Filter or maybe General tab, on the <br/>
second or third page of options (ie. use the NEXT button to go the next page <br/>
of options).  This may be why you are not getting the &quot;a_mob_00 nods&quot; and <br/>
resist messages.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>

PS:  The absolute safest spot on Norrath to practice the Brass instruments <br/>
skill is in the Arena zone in Lake Rathe.  Just make sure you play it <br/>
outside of the PVP area so nobody kills you while you are afk.<br/>

PPS:  I fell for 10000 damage today in Frontier Mountains when I got hit by <br/>
a lag pocket while playing the levitation song.  Made a nice red white and <br/>

&gt;Subject: Kelin the dubiously talented song writer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just who was this Kelin anyway?  Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit of a <br/>
&gt;problem figuring out what to do<br/>
&gt;with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on the <br/>
&gt;list about this song, but<br/>
&gt;usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write <br/>
&gt;this since I got the darn song,<br/>
&gt;because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
&gt;...<br/>
&gt;Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first got it <br/>
&gt;because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&gt;&quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small group <br/>
&gt;of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
&gt;Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; message.  <br/>
&gt;Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song just <br/>
&gt;really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
&gt;wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I thought <br/>
&gt;I recalled from previous<br/>
&gt;discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So why <br/>
&gt;bother for just a few levels of<br/>
&gt;use?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any advice.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a piece <br/>
&gt;of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
&gt;soundly on the butt.<br/>
