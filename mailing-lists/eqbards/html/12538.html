<div id="ygrps-yiv-983854604">Yes, it happens to me all the time now that I have a fast connection.  It is<br/>
not song specific as far as I can tell.  Basically what seems to happen is<br/>
your client message that you restarted the song gets lost by the server<br/>
while its sending the song stops message.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Twisting bug?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the following recently while twisting songs. I&#39;m soloing and<br/>
singing Chant/Chains/Hymn and found that sometimes, just as the Chant or<br/>
Hymn is about to expire I get the following:<br/>
<br/>
You whistle an ancient warsong.<br/>
You stop whistling.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, my song kicks in just before it the buff expires, but still<br/>
expires shortly afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else know about this as a bug?<br/>
