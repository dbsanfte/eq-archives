&gt; Forgive me if this has been covered before..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being 17th level and new to the sneak<br/>
&gt; skill.. Can someone tell me what it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; good for? I try to practice it as often<br/>
&gt; as possible but a few things I&#39;ve noticed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. How do you know if you&#39;re successful?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You will start to walk slowly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. How long does it last if you are?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Untill a mob see you and attack you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. It appears you can&#39;t sneak if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;    playing any song. Is this correct?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. The button will be disabled.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Do we have a skill cap on it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. 75 i think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. What&#39;s it good for?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not mutch... At lvl 19, you get the invisibility song, it is mutch better thank<br/>
sneak.<br/>
<br/>
The only use i can think about is to bring a Vendor to Indifferent( when they<br/>
don&#39;t have any faction, like the Aviak Vendor in South Karana). If they do have<br/>
a faction, use Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrillion, they will become Amiable...<br/>
