<div id="ygrps-yiv-651837075">Sheesh.  I&#39;m not asking those bards to do the mezzing when I&#39;m an enchanter.<br/>
I&#39;m asking them to do it when I&#39;m a druid and there isn&#39;t room to root/park<br/>
or when I&#39;m the warrior.  And they&#39;re simply unable to do it, which is a<br/>
shame because I know they can do it.  I&#39;ve done it with my bard time and<br/>
time again, and I see posts here all the time that you&#39;ve done it, too.<br/>

&gt; I wasn&#39;t going to go there, but the internet being what it is, you can<br/>
&gt; always count on someone else. ;)<br/>

&gt; They probably look at you funny since you are an enchanter asking a bard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; keep two targets mezzed.  That would be your responsibility since you are<br/>
&gt; better at it.  If I group with an enchanter and they ask me to mez<br/>
 </span></blockquote>targets,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then I&#39;m gonna assume they are the one clueless about their class, not me.<br/>
&gt; I will however likely have songs memmed to bail them out in the event they<br/>
&gt; get in trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now if there is no enchanter in the group and the bard can&#39;t perform basic<br/>
&gt; crowd control because he doesn&#39;t know how, then you have a case.<br/>
