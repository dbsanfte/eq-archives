<div id="ygrps-yiv-646994914">There is another faction type quest and you dont have to zone, taking some<br/>
soup up to near the marshal but I forget both party&#39;s in the quest.  It is a<br/>
very very short run though sometimes you can run fast enough  the door on<br/>
the bank doesnt close before you have another bowl of soup.  Although I did<br/>
train the girl a little closer to the bank door before I started doing the<br/>
quest.<br/>

Last I checked that quest, the NPC will only give the turnips to low level<br/>
characters.  Do it early if you want the faction from it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;actually, there&#39;s a quest you can do really quick with selo&#39;s or sow in<br/>
&gt;rivervale (no zoning), the turnip delivery quest, I got a druid to 11 doing<br/>
&gt;it on test server once, he was very very warmly when i stopped doing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have to get ungodly good faction with GuardiansoftheVale, which you can<br/>
<br/>
&gt;gain by killing Goblins, Mooto and Deathfist Orcs; and by turning belts in <br/>
&gt;to Deputy Budo, and goblin warbeads in to Sheriff Roglio.  My Halfling <br/>
