 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how it was for me as well... the 20&#39;s were my hell levels.  I went<br/>
thru 27 - 37 in about 1/4 the time it took to go thru 19 - 27.  I must have<br/>
died nearly 200 times in my 20&#39;s.  One major benefit is being ported out of<br/>
a battle gone awry, rather than trying to crawl to the zone.  But mostly it<br/>
is being with competent people and working lots of blues rather than few<br/>
reds.  I&#39;ve averaged about 1 death a level since 27, quite a change from my<br/>
20&#39;s.  And _that_ definately adds to the fun factor.  _I_ am certainly<br/>
enjoying the game more staying alive instead of trapsing back from my bind<br/>
point. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Right now, my Bard is somewhat on the shelf until they sort out the<br/>
overcrowding problems.  It&#39;s more fun playing a level 8 Shaman in Kerra Isle<br/>
(and training myself to death :), than it is spending 45 mins trying to find<br/>
a place to hunt... Even Paw is crowded on Xegony these days.<br/>
