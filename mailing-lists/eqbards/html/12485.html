<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967377111">i was off the last couple days (busy killing dragons in fact), just saw this<br/>
thread.  gotta go with everyone else on this one Harm.  we can kill either<br/>
dragon with 21 to 24 ppl with few if any deaths.  everyone brings their heat<br/>
or cold equipment.  e.g. all the tanks wear gnomish environmental suits,<br/>
jewelry, froglok crowns, etc.  i ALWAYS (used caps for you there) play<br/>
guardian/elemental with a drum.  everyone is at or close to 200+ MR and<br/>
FR/CR.  we killed 4 dragons this last week (gotta love patches and server<br/>
crashes erasing the 9 day wait) and all were extremely successful.  you are<br/>
right, more people is more lag.  need very experienced group of 24 ppl<br/>
optimally.  and i have done no tests, i just know what works.  obviously the<br/>
people and tactics are most important, but one of those tactics is boosting<br/>
resists.  on this note, the last two times the servers crashed this week, we<br/>
did vox one night while nagafen was done by another guild at the same time.<br/>
we killed all of Vox&#39;s guards and Vox and completed the lotto in under an<br/>
hour.  the other guild had yet to finish the FGs and 5 hours later had never<br/>
killed nagafen, having had to pass to another guild.  same thing next<br/>
dragon, we did nagafen and they did vox.  6 hours after we killed nagafen<br/>
they finally got vox down.  obviously we&#39;re not slamming you Harm, just<br/>
rethink the resist theory.<br/>

P.S. I think Maravana reads this list.  Grats on your drum after the first<br/>
server crash.  I am very jealous.  From what i have been keeping track of,<br/>
Nagafen has dropped a drum on 5 out of his last 8 kills.  I happened to kill<br/>
him on those 3 he did NOT, and missed the 5 he did.  Frustration is setting<br/>
in.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll agree that level does play a big part in resists.  But if you thing the<br/>
CR theory is &#39;bunk&#39;, then I wish you many happy dragon deaths until you<br/>
learn.<br/>
