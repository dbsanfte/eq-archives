<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616404896">Not really a POS, my level 41 rogue switches it out to backstab with...hit for 170 twice tonight with the thing, and thats not even close to max with that weapon, which is alreay far above my SBD which maxed at 160 unbuffed.  Its good to have played a bard, makes weapon switching much more realistic :)   *wishes she had a crystilline spear* Mmm...300+dmg backstabs....<br/>

  &gt; I picked one of them glowing iron pikes up in a lambent trade.  Haven&#39;t been<br/>
  &gt; able to figure what to do with it sense.  Anyone know what they are worth<br/>
  &gt; value wise?  No one seems interested in it for trades so far...<br/>
<br/>
    Just another pos.  I wish he would have dropped the chestplate.<br/>
<br/>
    Ah well, I&#39;m a dreamer in _their_ world now.<br/>
