  If the NPC heading your way has not been engaged or taunted sufficiently<br/>
  any song you play will act as a taunt.  The happens a lot to me in the<br/>
  Plane of Sky.  Monk pulls a mob, mob comes home and sees me up front<br/>
  and whacks me once, and then forgets about me the rest of the battle<br/>
  after it&#39;s taunted and damaged heavier by tanks.<br/>
<br/>
  This is something that ties to basic design of the Bard class itself.<br/>
<br/>
  In early beta, the Bard sang his/her song to everyone around them.<br/>
<br/>
  If a Bard blew by 6 people medding with selo&#39;s and a selo&#39;s pulse <br/>
  caught them, they all would stand up and get the &#39;Your feet move<br/>
  faster&#39; message.  Needless to say, /all/ casters hated bards for<br/>
  that.  Bard song use to reach everyone in the radius.  Of course<br/>
  this is not desired.  Thus instead of Verant recoding their engine<br/>
  to send song signals to just party members, it now sends out a pulse<br/>
  to everyone and everything in your radius, and then does a check on<br/>
  the object to see if it&#39;s in your party.  If it is, the effect is<br/>
  applied, if not the effect is not applied, but it&#39;s not ignored.<br/>
  It&#39;s considered a huge taunt.<br/>
<br/>
  If I stood in the middle of 40 people and played any song, I&#39;m <br/>
  &#39;helping&#39; 40 people, and I become an increased value target.<br/>
  I&#39;ve had things B-line for me out of the blue because of this.<br/>
  This is also the reason why Bards die so much, or are hated by<br/>
  NPCs so much - A coding failure on Verant&#39;s part.  Instead of<br/>
  remedying the base problem, they just patched it.  Usually <br/>
  taunting and constant attack keeps NPCs off me, but that shift<br/>
  doesn&#39;t occur until after L25 when tank skills (taunt/offense)<br/>
  become high enough to overpower my hate rating on the NPC hatelist.<br/>
<br/>
  Still, I&#39;ll always get tagged right off the bat before any mob is<br/>
  engaged if I&#39;m playing songs and close enough.  It gets better<br/>
  as you gain levels however.<br/>
