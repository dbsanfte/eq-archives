<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832302553"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group. I&#39;m a level 10 bard on <br/>
&gt;Tarew Marr. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always <br/>
&gt;looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp <br/>
&gt;to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a group&quot; <br/>
&gt;I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in the <br/>
&gt;area. Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone <br/>
&gt;experienced this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a word, yes. I am, or was, a bard of the 10th rank on Cazic-Thule. No <br/>
matter where I went, North Ro, East or West Commons, and other places that <br/>
are generally very populaated. I&#39;d send out several &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard <br/>
looking for a group&quot;, and never would I get a response. The few times I got <br/>
a response it was from a group of people all several levels lower than me, <br/>
or several levels higher than me. It got me so annoyed, along with the fact <br/>
I couldn&#39;t get any experience towards rank 11 without getting mauled by Gix <br/>
in West Commons while retriving my corpse, that I restarted the whole <br/>
profession.<br/>
