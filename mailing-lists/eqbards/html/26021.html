&gt; Agreed there are periods of a bards life that are a bit boring, but I think<br/>
&gt; that goes for every char.. Bards have a great advantage at the higher<br/>

level range. Intcasters get three sets of useful spells during that boring<br/>
span, wiscasters two, and even with hybrids they get spells at nine, then<br/>
fifteen, then twenty two, never having to go eight levels without anything useful.<br/>
