<b>Subject:</b> The Summoning of Mayong Mistmoore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592979927">If Mayong is in the zone but not reachable by normal methods due to pathing<br/>
problems, is it possible that a solo bard who continues to use the 21st level<br/>
teleport song could eventually teleport to the area where Mayong is at?  If so,<br/>
then it might be possible to pull him outside.  That assumes the bard stays<br/>
alive long enough for the next pulse of the teleport song.  This also assumes<br/>
Mayong decides to track down the bard whereever he is at in the zone.  This<br/>
would be a safe situation for the bard to sing the teleport song as long as<br/>
other groups are controlling the spawns inside the castle.  <br/>
<br/>
Since you said Mayong is somewhere in the zone, was wondering if there is a<br/>
location inside the castle where you get messages that he is casting spells.  A<br/>
good example is right there at the zone border.  If you are standing near the<br/>
corner right at the zone border you will get messages that mobs inside the<br/>
castle are casting spells.  If you use AE songs/spells near the zone, you have a<br/>
chance of aggroing stuff inside the castle who will then nuke you from behind<br/>
the wall even though you can&#39;t see them.  If there is any area in the castle<br/>
where you get messages that Mayong is casting spells that would help the bard<br/>
narrow down the areas to use the teleport song.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; well  i wish you luck on this event, i do know however that you will not be <br/>
&gt; seeing mayong unless a gm takes control of him and brings him out to play. <br/>
&gt; Mayong is currently in the game, albeit in an area which is not reachable by <br/>
&gt; players due to pathing problems. there was a huge thread a while back on the <br/>
&gt; kunark message board about &quot;mysteries of norrath&quot; and somone posted a quote <br/>
&gt; from one of the verant people saying we couldn&#39;t get to mayong.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess one possiblity is that if mayong is somewhere in the zone in reach <br/>
&gt; of an aoe spell/song you might tag him that way and get him to come out, but <br/>
&gt; i would guess that is not the case.there is always a chance that a gm could <br/>
&gt; show up with him however, so good luck. either way it sounds like fun.<br/>
