Arch Mage Answers<br/>
A new section was launched on the official EverQuest site today called Arch<br/>
Mage Answers. This section is a series of questions and answers regarding<br/>
magic-related issues and subjects. The person answering the questions is<br/>
Verant Game Designer Geoffrey Zatkin, aka the Arch Mage of Norrath. Here&#39;s<br/>
an excerpt:<br/>
Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>
When we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for<br/>
expansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because Bards get one song per<br/>
level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room<br/>
for expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>
<br/>
Expect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything that<br/>
radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>
keep the Bard interesting at high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Geoffrey!<br/>
