<div id="ygrps-yiv-882086701">Agreed.  Three bards in a group can be loads of fun.  Be sure to remind<br/>
everyone to turn their Partical Density setting as low as it can go.<br/>
Otherwise they may have massive lag due to all the songs that will be in<br/>
effect.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Bards and Enchanters<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since some people think we bards are very limited when grouped with bards, I<br/>
thought I would relate what happened to me Tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
When I logged in, two of my guildmates (bard and enchanter) were grouped<br/>
together with a warrior and another bard.  I was invited to join them.  So<br/>
our group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us bards were around<br/>
level 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs for all of us<br/>
to twist 3 songs each.<br/>
<br/>
The enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than that, he was just<br/>
medding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  He commented<br/>
on that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>
the ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was the enchanter.<br/>
Just thought it was funny.<br/>
