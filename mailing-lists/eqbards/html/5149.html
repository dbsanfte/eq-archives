<b>Subject:</b> RE: Missed notes on songs- Stealth Nerfing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-32748666">I agree. Basically, Verant feels the need to alter the<br/>
game balance by nerfing from character classes. This may<br/>
be part of a larger effort to help the pure melee classes.<br/>
In any case, I think they have come to the conclusion that<br/>
if they can do it silently, no one may notice or be<br/>
able to prove it. This lets them avoid any headaches dealing<br/>
with pesky paying customers. <br/>
<br/>
The problem with this stealth nerfing policy is that it gets<br/>
characters killed who havent been notified of the changes and<br/>
attempt to do something that has always succeeded in the past.<br/>
As paying customers, I believe that everyone has the right to<br/>
be informed of any substantive changes that affect the gameplay<br/>
that we all pay for. That is why I suggest thated a clause on<br/>
stealth nerfing be placed in the Bard petition (Bards seem to<br/>
have been victimized a couple of times by this). On the other<br/>
hand, it may be more worthwhile to start a separate petition<br/>
demanding that Verant publish and adhere to an Open Disclosure<br/>
Agreement that commits them to release these types of changes<br/>
immediately upon implementing them. The &quot;knife in the dark&quot;<br/>
stealth nerfing policy is very unprofessional. <br/>

&gt; but its the only reason I am all of a sudden having this problem. Any<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; explanation is crap. We only started having this problem when they patched<br/>
&gt; the the Missed Notes on high level songs last patch. We all need to /bug<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; /petition this everynight to get it fixed, or get a real explanation of<br/>
&gt; whats going on.<br/>

I think I mentioned this before, but let me do it again.  It is my<br/>
personal opinion that Verant may be nerfing casters silently.  This is<br/>
particularly noticable on your earlier songs/spells where you very rarely<br/>
fizzle. miss a not or are interrupted.  As of last night my level 17<br/>
magician on a full bar of mana in combat fizzle twice and was interrupted<br/>
five or six times while trying to cast shock of blades.  Please not that<br/>
Shock of Blades is a lvl 8 DD spell that I have been using since I got it.<br/>
My skill is maxed for my level.  So this may be a nerf for casters which I<br/>
think it might be,  I would not put it past Verant for nerfing something<br/>
without telling us at all.<br/>
