<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802635435">Ah, remember the first time I had seen a &quot;real&quot; bard, for I was only but<br/>
a young bardling, and in the Faydark orc camps, late.  Dark and<br/>
crowded, people slaying orcs and I was on my toes because I could be snuffed<br/>
quickly at any moment.  Looked up, a human standing on a tent, strumming a<br/>
lute.  Had never quite seen such a thing, entranced, thought he looked<br/>
great, and the way he was strumming, almost like he was standing up there<br/>
arrogantly showing the world how cool he was (ah, he was just healing).<br/>
<br/>
I went up on top of the tent next to him and said &quot;Hail,&quot; and he hailed me<br/>
back.  So then came all these bardling-type questions, a flood of them.<br/>
Remember, &quot;Why do you use an instrument when you can just sing it?&quot;  Dumb<br/>
things like that.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Sorry, don&#39;t understand, German,&quot; and then I saw accelerando for<br/>
the first time.  &quot;One day!&quot; I cried, looking down at the sparklies where he<br/>
had once been.  &quot;One day!&quot;<br/>

PS: By the way, I find if you&#39;re really busy and someone asks you anything<br/>
stupid like why you use an instrument just to tell them you&#39;re german.<br/>
