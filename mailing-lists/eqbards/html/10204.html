<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-385198457">This is similar to what I noticed last week as well.  I was in Kithicor and<br/>
got a root icon on me (checked and it was root) but I was still running with<br/>
Selo&#39;s all the way to highhold.  I zoned in and immediately was rooted in<br/>
place.  I had assumed an orc medic ahd got me, but now it seems more likely<br/>
there is some Selo&#39;s/Root bug still lurking out there.  Not sure what the<br/>
exact conditions were, but if it happens again I will check for sure.<br/>

When Kithicor first became undead hell, I got rooted by an undead<br/>
healer(?), was able to run into Rivervale, and once I had zoned in,<br/>
discovered that I was rooted.<br/>
<br/>
Early Last week I was in unrest and got rooted, I broke out on the next<br/>
pulse. managed to zone out, and once again discovered that I was rooted<br/>
OUTSIDE the zone.</div>
