<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Q: Will twisting ever be coded against? I.e. is it considered cheating? If <br/>
&gt;it is, I definitely want to know about it now.<br/>
&gt;A: Twisting is not cheating. It won&#39;t be coded against. We are even looking<br/>
<br/>
&gt;at putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower <br/>
&gt;machines twist better, while not allowing those with faster machines to <br/>
&gt;twist more often.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Me: This could be very interesting.<br/>

count on it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Q: If any instruments raise song effectiveness, can you please have that <br/>
&gt;listed when we examine it?<br/>
&gt;A: Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming<br/>
<br/>
&gt;that type of song can be increased by an instrument (example: Any set of <br/>
&gt;Drums will make you run faster when playing Selo&#39;s Accelerando). Some <br/>
&gt;instruments will increase your effect more then others. The same new<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the <br/>
&gt;following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, Solon&#39;s Song<br/>
<br/>
&gt;of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles?<br/>
&gt;A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>none.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Me: If Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens is not enhanced be equiping a flute then <br/>
&gt;why is it listed as a wind song? Using a flute with Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike<br/>
<br/>
&gt;does not increase the MR debuff.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kit: It definitely affects Carillion but nothing else as far as I can see.<br/>
By GZ&#39;s own words it should not affect the MR debuff of Pixie as he says &quot;it<br/>
only affects the primary effect, nothing else&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Q: I play a shaman. This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but I was wondering<br/>
<br/>
&gt;what are the best buffs for a bard? For example, I recently discovered ... <br/>
&gt;that dexterity helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs that a wise <br/>
&gt;bard should be asking for?<br/>
&gt;A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs. Most Bards that I know can <br/>
&gt;also always use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts <br/>
&gt;them dangerously close to encumbrance. AC & HP buffs are also nice - most <br/>
&gt;denizens of Norrath have an inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take<br/>

&gt;Me: **Warning Sarcasm Alert** I do not think the hatred of muscian&#39;s in <br/>

Sonorous Clouding does not grant see Invisible to the party.  However, in<br/>
the limited testing I did last night, which really only consisted of running<br/>
invisible through Nek Forest with a partner, everything could see us if it<br/>
got into what would be a close party range.  Maybe the song now provides -<br/>
Non-group See Invisible.  That sounds like a useful and well tested<br/>
enhancement.  How can anyone support Verant&#39;s claim that they test changes,<br/>
and more specifically that they test bards after yet another example of a<br/>
change that takes 30 seconds to test not working???<br/>
<br/>
After reading the patch message, logging in and running thru Nek without<br/>
being able to see my companion, who laughed and said I told you so in<br/>
response to my disgust at the change not working, I was pretty peeved.  The<br/>
15 tells I got in the next 15 minutes from people asking how I liked the new<br/>
&quot;See Visible&quot; enhancement from non-bard guildmates was the last straw.  I<br/>
camped and went and played AC.  It wasn&#39;t much fun, but it was more fun than<br/>
being lied to and having it rubbed in my face again.<br/>
