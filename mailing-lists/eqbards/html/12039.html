<div id="ygrps-yiv-673070883">Not to mention neither Druids nor Shamans can really fight in Melee...<br/>
<br/>
We can still pretend we do...<br/>
<br/>
Druids and Shamans are kind of the generalist casters, having a great<br/>
variety of spells, but we bards are really the only people who can fill<br/>
almost any role in the party...<br/>
<br/>
I had a good example of this (granted I am low level, 10, so I can still<br/>
tank in a pinch).<br/>
<br/>
Saturday:  Fighting orcs in S Ro.  I joined 4 trolls (1 shaman, 3 War or<br/>
SK) and a Delf SK.  My job was to since my buffing songs (anthem and<br/>
elemental), then heal us all up after battle.  (Does troll regen with<br/>
our bard song?  Being trolls I could not a straight answer out of them: <br/>
&quot;How much are you healing while you sit?&quot;  &quot;EetBugz heel gud.  Lik elfy<br/>
sing.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday: Fighting same orcs with a new group: 2 wizards, 2 enchanters,<br/>
shaman.  I became the tank, having more than a full column of buffs at<br/>
lvl 10 is pretty cool, btw.  I felt like a real warrior.<br/>
