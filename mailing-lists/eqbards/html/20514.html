<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640301643">In my entire EQ career, I can honestly say I never said in shout, out <br/>
of character, or even guild chat, the word &quot;ding&quot;.  I rarely (to my <br/>
recollection) even said anything other than &quot;Hold on a moment while I <br/>
scribe a new song&quot;.  But, the time has come for me to shout &quot;DING&quot;.  <br/>
Rosha Cristi, born on March 26th, 1999 on the server of Innoruuk <br/>
finally achieved the 50th level after 65 days and 20 hours of <br/>
playtime.  Many thanks go out to the people on this list from whom I <br/>
have learned many a thing about being a successful bard.  Thank You.<br/>
