<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036689566">Pathing in MM is insane, and usually what causes the most problems.  Also -<br/>
if you see a pet at the zone - DON&#39;T attack it - it is misspawned from the<br/>
other side of the castle wall - and if you do - not only will it&#39;s master<br/>
come - but a goodly percentage of the castle with it.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping with someone that knows MM well - and all the buggy path problems<br/>
is by far your best bet - and have them point out all the problems along<br/>
the way.<br/>

&gt;Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a level 24 bard, soon to be 25. Seeing as how the next few songs are<br/>
&gt;available in kelethin, I figured I&#39;d make mistmore my new home. I was<br/>
&gt;wondering if you had any advice in so far as what areas are appropriate for<br/>
&gt;my level and what to watch out for (besides the massive trains)<br/>
