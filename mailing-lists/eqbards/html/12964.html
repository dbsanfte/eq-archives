<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020197022">I must admit there are few good piercing weapons that bards can use dispite<br/>
having the piercing skill. I currently wield the following weapons:<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Wriggling<br/>
Obscene Scimitar<br/>
Obscene Shard<br/>
Dragoon Dirk<br/>
<br/>
As my piercing skill is not maxxed yet (it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s) I alternate<br/>
between weapons depending on the situation, so if I am in a group of 6 that<br/>
are doing fine I whack the piercers in, if it gets hairy I swap back again.<br/>
I am only doing this so that I can eventually dual wield the Staff and<br/>
shard (Proc&#39;s galore). The Dirk stays in my range slot unless I am<br/>
practicing piercing.<br/>
What we need is a top quality piercer that is better that the shard, ok the<br/>
shard is a good weapon but I find it gets resisted far too much, in Cazic<br/>
it has a 40% resist rate, don&#39;t know if this is because my skill is not<br/>
high enough or what but it&#39;s not great. And 30 dmg isn&#39;t a great deal<br/>
considering a monk can kick for 80+ every 5-10 seconds. I prefer the look<br/>
when I dual wield piercers though, the so called ugly stick and simitar are<br/>
well out of proportion for a small woodelf bard.<br/>
<br/>
The only good piercing weapon I know of is from the Plains, I believe it is<br/>
the Martune Rapier???<br/>
<br/>
Bards/Rogues are similar classes so I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t let us wield<br/>
the same weapons. However I can understand Rogues getting more choice of<br/>
weapons as they do not have the choice of any other weapon skills.<br/>

Here is a semi-related topic from this thread.  I was thinking about<br/>
including a condensed version of it in my post I intend to write as part of<br/>
the &quot;ArchMage answers everything bards want to know&quot; thread on the official<br/>
EQ board.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to any of the EQ spoiler sites and look at all the piercing<br/>
weapons in the game, you&#39;ll see that a lot of them are Rogue only.  Now I&#39;m<br/>
a firm believer that every class should have weapons that only they can<br/>
wield, but it seems to me there are a disproportionate number of rogue only<br/>
piercing weapons in the game compared to the actual number of people who<br/>
play rogues.  Lets also take into account how many classes actually use<br/>
piercing weapons.  Other than rogues, bards are about the only other class<br/>
in the game that equip piercing weapons on a regular basis.  A ranger here<br/>
and there may use them but most rangers I see use 1HS weapons.  You almost<br/>
never any other class using them.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see is either: 1) some of the rogue only piercing<br/>
items<br/>
changed to where bards can equip them or 2) more piercing weapons<br/>
(appropriate for 25-35 level characters) added to the game that a bard can<br/>
equip.  The counter argument is that bards have a wide variety of 1HS, 1HB<br/>
and piercing weapons already in the game that they can use.  True.  But<br/>
since bards and rogues traditionally resemble one another, IMO it only<br/>
makes<br/>
sense that we can both use the same weapons.  Also, a lot of bards,<br/>
especially those who are wood elves, have a very low Stamina stat.  As a<br/>
result, I prefer to wield light weapons with fast Delay rates to avoid the<br/>
stamina drain.  Most piercing weapons fall into this category.<br/>
<br/>
Am I smoking crack here thinking there aren&#39;t enough medium level piercing<br/>
weapons in the game for bards to use?<br/>
