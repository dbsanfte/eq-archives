&gt; fired up fear to try to clear a space. It wasn&#39;t even 3 seconds later<br/>
&gt; that most of the tower, including the gargoyles from way out by the<br/>
&gt; drawbridge were on our butts. Unfortunately the ghoul beating on the<br/>
&gt; druid resisted so the druid died, followed by the whole rest of the<br/>

In certain dungeons, nod song is simply better because of the way monsters<br/>
behave in that dungeon.  Screech trains in lower guk, but nod doesn&#39;t.<br/>
And, well, I&#39;ve never been to lower guk when I was between lvl 35 and 49<br/>
without a group gater (I&#39;m willing to go now, because dying doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter to me personally anymore).  If there was a bard in my group, I made<br/>
it abundantly clear that if we have to evac out, he plays nod, not<br/>
screech.  Even if most of the monsters resist the nod spell, the hate<br/>
factor is so high that the bard pulls everything off the gater<br/>
immediately.  Then, it&#39;s just a matter of gettting the gate off before the<br/>
cleric is unable to keep the bard alive any longer.  And it&#39;s definitely<br/>
better for the bard to die, than for the whole party to die.<br/>
