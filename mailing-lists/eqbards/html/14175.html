&gt;probably send it in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It IS a big deal if it is also affecting the spell. I believe ENchanters and<br/>
Shamans get the spell. (not sure about shamans) To cast the spell requires<br/>
1)<br/>
memming it (Enchanters usually have enough spells needed that this spell<br/>
would get swapped in and out) and 2) mana. If it is going to continually be<br/>
dropped...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to try the song that gives Infravision and see if it affects<br/>
someone<br/>
that has Serpent Sight up as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if an Enchanter has Illusion: dark elf up, does this song affect THAT<br/>
Ultravision?</div>
