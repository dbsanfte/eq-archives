hard time finding a &quot;free&quot; set) as they&#39;re the same AC,<br/>
weight, and color as steel plate (the ones that cost 420pp)<br/>
and have +5 disease resist(?) to boot.  I saw a lot of people<br/>
offering them the first couple days, but it&#39;s slowly died down<br/>
as more people figure this out.<br/>

The icy greaves are worse than normal plate, but have the blue<br/>
color of lambent.  I expect they&#39;ll become popular too, as it<br/>
gives a nice &quot;blue jeans&quot; effect when combined with normal<br/>
armor.<br/>
