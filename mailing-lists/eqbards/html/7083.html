<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812717466">This message is a repost.  I have sent out and gotten back two different<br/>
messages that were sent out after I originally sent this one.  Sorry if you<br/>
end up getting it twice.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, at the suggestion of a few people from this list, I ventured for<br/>
the first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I had been in South Karana<br/>
before to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had never fought anything<br/>
there.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th level players, four of<br/>
which were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>
avoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that she would sing the level<br/>
25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and anything else appropriate.<br/>
We were camping at the top of the village where avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>
and darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with this group for almost<br/>
two hours.  Me and the other bard were the default tanks.  For the first<br/>
time in a long time, I was no longer the center of attention.  In almost<br/>
every fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get the aviaks initial<br/>
attention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the aviak, they often found<br/>
themselves the center of attention.  I, on the other hand, almost never got<br/>
attacked the entire night.  The most health I ever dropped to was about 50%.<br/>
This happened when an avocet spawned while we were in the process of<br/>
fighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots of fun.  The lower<br/>
level bard also has the luxury of not having to worry too much about getting<br/>
continually whacked on.  <br/>
