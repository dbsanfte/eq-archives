<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-327049814">To clarify, this was a case where the cleric and druid coming in made<br/>
absolutely no effort to do anything but make it into a free for all. The druid<br/>
asked if there was an order, and I said yes, myself and the cleric, and<br/>
another wizard that was present. The druid, instead of asking if she could<br/>
have a turn in the rotation, stated that it would be a &quot;FFA&quot; (free for all).<br/>
Why would a L28 druid barge into the warlord room in that manner, unless they<br/>
were confident they could win every kill? As I said, after my demonstration,<br/>
she apologized for how she acted and said she was not aware a bard could do<br/>
such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
Side note, I also have a lower level druid I play, and it is extremely easy to<br/>
do enough damage to get credit for a kill. However, having played through 26<br/>
levels as a class where I was often having my kill stolen, I instead help<br/>
others and only steal kills off people doing it to others, whether they be<br/>
bards, warriors, or lower level players. I&#39;m sort of a Robin Hood of EQ - help<br/>
those in need, and antagonize the jerks to no end.<br/>
