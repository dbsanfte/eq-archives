<div id="ygrps-yiv-169719197">Kael is a tough zone.  As a 39 bard I&#39;ve found that charasmatic Carrilion has limited effect for me and sneak is the way to go if your faction is low and you need something.  The good quests are all in King Tormax&#39;s area and you can&#39;t get thru there with invis song -- you may be able to sneak but one of the &quot;features&quot; of Kael is that anyone dragging a body is KOS, regardless of faction so plan for a difficult CR if things go badly.  <br/>
If you are going thru Kael using sonorous clouding, be sure to con giants at regular intervals.  If any of them see thru the song, you are likely close to the temple of Rallos Zek, a very bad place to be, even if you are agnostic -- all bards are KOS there.<br/>

Has anyone successfully charm/sneak/invis their way in to some Kael or SS<br/>
armor? I&#39;m thinking of trying the Iceshackles and Dragon Tooth quests even<br/>
though I&#39;m KOS and would love some experienced advice - and hope that<br/>
someday I can get the SS armor if I get the gems.<br/>
