<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676766512">In my experiences in unrest vs. Ghoulroot spells, i&#39;ve noticed that maybe <br/>
more than 50% of the time that &quot;strength returns to your legs&quot; as i start <br/>
selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled two ghouls and a dark boned skel to the zone, as it was very early <br/>
in the morning. I got one down to nearly nothing, then got rooted. I <br/>
immediately started selo&#39;s in hopes that it once again save me. I do believe <br/>
that it was NO coincidence. Besides, I did also notice that once I got to <br/>
the other side (dagnor&#39;s), I was again rooted. Hmm...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Actually, my friend I think you are mistaken.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;pretty sure I have read even Brad say that selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt;originally was supposed to break root.  Now, it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t probably because the sow folks complained that<br/>
&gt;bards were too powerful which is BS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I got rooted last night by something and I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t break it by starting up selo&#39;s.  It did,<br/>
&gt;however, work against my wizard friend&#39;s root.  Or at<br/>
&gt;least it appeared to.  And this was by starting up<br/>
&gt;selo&#39;s AFTER the root was in place.  Since he is 4<br/>
&gt;levels higher than me I&#39;d be surprised if I was<br/>
&gt;breaking it on my own with some strange magic<br/>
&gt;resistance that I don&#39;t know of. </span></blockquote></div>
