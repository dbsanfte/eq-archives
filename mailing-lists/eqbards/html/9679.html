<div id="ygrps-yiv-82343718">Oh hello there, yes I remember you.<br/>
<br/>
How have you been doing?<br/>
<br/>
Alas I am struggling in level 27, I&#39;ve been at 27 for days and have failed<br/>
to get above 1 bubble of exp, then last night I thought I&#39;d help the cause<br/>
and die a few times, back to 26. Oh well, I got back to 27 later that<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your doing better than I am.<br/>
