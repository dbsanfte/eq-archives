<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149509029"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 100 seemed to be the magic number, but.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doing some extensive testing at Dex&#39;s between 85 and 143 I <br/>
&gt; found that procs<br/>
&gt; occurred about twice as often at 100 as at 85.  It doubled <br/>
&gt; again at or near<br/>
&gt; 132 in my tests and not much change thereafter. ymmv.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! one question, was it linear or did it just suddenly double?<br/>
<br/>
If it suddenly doubles then that suggests I should get my agi up to 100 only<br/>
by replacing the BP neclace with something that has 5 agi and some AC. Okee<br/>
doke, thanks!<br/>
