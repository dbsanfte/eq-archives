<div id="ygrps-yiv-543293944">We were kinda desparate for a spot one night and ended up pulling &#39;shrooms<br/>
in lower Seb.  And bored, so I memmed this in and *thought* I could see some<br/>
difference, i.e. shorther fights - less heals by the mobs.  But, ya, that<br/>
was the only time I ever  used it.  Rumor is that in PvP, mana drain from<br/>
this is actually somewhat effective, e.g.: &quot;... there I wuz... I mezzed him<br/>
and twisted Dissention so he had to sit there and watch his mana bar<br/>
dropping... then I charmed him and walked him under water while twisting my<br/>
endure breath song..., then I dropped dirge on him and finished him off in<br/>
one nuke!  Then I woke up...&quot;<br/>
