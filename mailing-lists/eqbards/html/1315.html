<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050721493">I visited Blackburrow today in search of Onyx earrings.  A<br/>
huge train came up to the zone.  I couldn&#39;t just stand and do<br/>
nothing so I hit the lullaby.  It worked.  On more than 4<br/>
mobs.  At one point, I must&#39;ve had a dozen or more gnolls<br/>
stacking away the Zzzzz&#39;s.  So it would seem there is no 4 mob<br/>
limit as had been previously stated.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t attack a single one.  They all attacked me because<br/>
they hated my song.  They only managed to take a bubble of my<br/>
health in about 5 minutes because my AC was 388.  All the<br/>
lower level folks loved it.  They got all the experience and<br/>
took virtually no damage.<br/>
<br/>
I got a ton of faction for it.  The guards and merchants in<br/>
Qeynos now view me amiably (used to be apprehensive).<br/>
