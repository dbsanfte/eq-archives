to finance a CR bag of flutes and drums...hehe.<br/>

&gt; Heh..yeah, I just stood there and took it.  I managed to type &quot;stay back&quot;<br/>
&gt; but with about 3 or 4 random typo&#39;s thrown in before dying.  I don&#39;t<br/>
stress<br/>
&gt; death...course, that time, no cleric was available (or willing *grrr*) to<br/>
&gt; give rezzes that night.  Everyone says how great selos is for CR, and it<br/>
&gt; is...but it&#39;s amazingly, ploddingly slow when you&#39;re running from Firona<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; Dalnirs (through WW is the worst), and used to Selos with the MM<br/>
&gt; drums...hehe.<br/>
