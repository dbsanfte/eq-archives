Sorry about the complaint in the previous message, but it is<br/>
getting annoying to me how many people from every class in this game<br/>
think that verant hates them their class more than the rest of the<br/>
classes.  As the one post said, by what I read about<br/>
EQ, Verant hates every class more than all the rest of the<br/>
classes.<br/>

&gt; specific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>
&gt; at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>
&gt; standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care.<br/>
