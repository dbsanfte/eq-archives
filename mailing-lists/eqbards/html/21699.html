<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784552129">Hmmm. At the time I ran into the jail and found that they couldn&#39;t come out <br/>
and get you, I figured that this made sense since they were all locked in <br/>
their cells. I didn&#39;t see this as an &quot;exploit&quot; in the sense that this is a <br/>
bug that you are exploiting. Someone at Verant had to put in the code to <br/>
lock the 3 mobs in their cells, and figured that this was just a part of <br/>
their world. The cells won&#39;t make you rich, you&#39;ll get exp, but not at a <br/>
rate as fast as you could with a group you could get into at your level.<br/>
<br/>
However, you are right in the sense that the melee mobs are easy to kick <br/>
with no danger whatsoever to the person doing this. However, the casting <br/>
mobs still cast at you even after the door closes. If you have 3 casters in <br/>
the cells, you are getting blasted by 2-3 of them. At least for a bard in <br/>
this room, you have a pretty decent chance of dying if you are soloing. <br/>
With a partner, it&#39;d be pretty easy, but it&#39;s only 3 spawns so it&#39;s kind of <br/>
slow. I just figured this was part of their game balance. I got bored with <br/>
it and have found more fun things to do with my limited time.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I&#39;d be banned for hunting there. If Verant sees this as a problem, <br/>
then one of their programmers can just unchain them. It&#39;s different than <br/>
the Cazic Thule exploits which relied on bad pathing or the rooftop exploit <br/>
where the players found the mobs wouldn&#39;t chase them. In the jail, I open <br/>
the door, they yell at me and some cast at me. I dot them over and over and <br/>
take what spells they could cast. The melee mobs are SOL against me. If <br/>
this wasn&#39;t part of the game design, then they can change it. Would I have <br/>
any problem with them changing it? Nope. Ultimately, I was just sharing <br/>
with you all places that I&#39;ve hunted at this level. I didn&#39;t see it as a <br/>
big exploit since melee classes still have to contend with the melee mobs. <br/>
For bards and casters this is a nice place. That&#39;s all I have to say on the <br/>
matter.<br/>

&gt;Wouldn&#39;t this be considered an exploit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve camped in the MM jail on numerous occasions but always before I got the<br/>
&gt;chant songs.  Also was always in a group so we just pulled them out of the<br/>
&gt;cells.  I assume what you were doing was opening the doors, targetting one<br/>
&gt;of the mobs, closing the doors, and then chanting until the mob died.<br/>
&gt;Curious what happens when the first chant hits.  If it is a caster mob, does<br/>
&gt;it cast through the door?  Melee mobs?  What about the mobs in the other<br/>
&gt;cells that you didn&#39;t target?<br/>

&gt;Maybe they&#39;ve been nerfed since. I did indeed sit and chant everything in<br/>
&gt;the cells to death, repeatedly and they never moved. *shrug*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did this about 3 weeks ago and all 3 of them were chained. The two on the<br/>
&gt;left could move to the door, but couldn&#39;t strike very far beyond it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I admit, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t always camped 24/7 as they were indeed<br/>
&gt;sitting ducks, except that casters were extremely dangerous. Also, the<br/>
&gt;wandering placeholder did make it a bit tougher.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Stuff in the cells are chained?  They sure didn&#39;t have any trouble chasing<br/>
&gt; &gt;me halfway to the zone before I outran them.  I hope you were kidding.<br/>
