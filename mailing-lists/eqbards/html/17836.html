<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168810025">I thought of a compromise that we used a couple of times in the past when we<br/>
couldn&#39;t agree on who should get into the lotto for a couple of items.  We<br/>
setup 3 groups, primary, secondary, and tertiary.  The primaries got to<br/>
random 21-120, the secondaries 1-100, the tertiaries 1-80.  That weighted<br/>
the distribution but at least everyone felt like they were involved.  A<br/>
tertiary won the first lotto strangely enough with a 37 roll.<br/>

I would imagine that the Haste effects jumping to 75% no matter which ones<br/>
you combine is a bug.  As such eventually its liable to get fixed, probably<br/>
sooner rather than later since its a bug that benefits players.  Once this<br/>
happens those lower end Haste items are not going to be as good for a bard<br/>
as the high end ones, any more than they are for melee types.<br/>

&gt; 2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  <br/>
<br/>
CoF and RBB I have no problems with being non-bard.  We don&#39;t<br/>
benefit from the additional haste (unless you&#39;re chain/fearing<br/>
with weapons, and if you&#39;re doing that often enough that you<br/>
feel you need one of these items, what&#39;s the point of being in<br/>
a guild?).  The extra AC and stats are nice, but in no way<br/>
make up for the additional haste (10%-15%) that another melee<br/>
class could gain from these two items.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (fbss only likely<br/>
&gt; one now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in group<br/>
&gt; according to guild rules)<br/>
<br/>
This I would sort of agree with, sort of disagree with.  With<br/>
a low-end haste item like a swirlspine belt or FBSS, a bard<br/>
could arguably gain *more* benefit than any other melee class.  <br/>
Take the FBSS for example.  It gives a 21% haste.  For a L50<br/>
bard whose normal melee haste is 30% (Verses), the FBSS will<br/>
put them at 75% haste - a 35% improvement.  For a sub-50 bard<br/>
whose normal max melee haste is 20% (Celerity), the FBSS gives<br/>
a 45% improvement.  In the hands of any other melee class,<br/>
it&#39;s only a 21% improvement unless they&#39;re grouped with a bard<br/>
or enchanter or shaman (only then does it become a 75%<br/>
improvement).  The difference is even more pronounced with a<br/>
swirlspine belt which from reports is a 15% haste.  I dunno<br/>
how many bard/ench/sham are in your guild so I can&#39;t say how<br/>
compelling an argument that would be.  But if the melee<br/>
classes rarely group with bards and enchanters, then the melee<br/>
argument favors the bard as most able to use a FBSS or<br/>
swirlspine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, OTOH, a bard of the right level to get these items has a<br/>
*lot* of other tools available.  My Belt of Concordance goes<br/>
mostly unused - a single Chant with my Selo&#39;s drum equals or<br/>
exceeds my average melee output with weapons and max haste.  <br/>
The only time I use my weapons lately is when I feel like<br/>
diving into melee, or if the mob is pretty much immune to<br/>
magic, or if I&#39;m prohibited from using the chants (TTs in<br/>
Fear seem to poof if they die from a DoT).<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend to your guild leader that rather than<br/>
completely exclude bards from these items, to set up a<br/>
&quot;scorecard.&quot;  If a bard has helped (say) 5 other people in the<br/>
guild get a FBSS or swirlspine belt, then the next one is his.  <br/>
That avoids the slippery slope problem where newer younger<br/>
guildmembers keep getting ahead of you in priority.  I would<br/>
stay out of the CoF and RBB entirely, but if you really want<br/>
one, I&#39;d suggest something like seeing 25-30 of them given to<br/>
guildmembers before you&#39;re allowed to roll for it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
<br/>
Not many guilds on Karana with 150+ players.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the<br/>
guild<br/>
&gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
&gt; item. (even tho they stack)<br/>
<br/>
Their reasoning is wrong - if you follow it through like I did<br/>
above, bards get the *most* melee benefit from haste items of<br/>
any class.  But for the other reasons I outlined above, I<br/>
pretty much have to side with them.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, they damn well better be willing to break their backs to<br/>
teleport a bard up to air if a Belt of Concordance drops and<br/>
there&#39;s no bard present.<br/>
