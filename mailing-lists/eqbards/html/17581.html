<br/>
Then again I have not spent a long time in the Warden&#39;s room, just kind of<br/>
pass through on my way to lower...never came across him.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s too many zones in this game, you senior guys will probably lose<br/>
whatever respect you may have for me entirely but there are zones that I<br/>
have still never even set foot in yet and I am level 43. I have NEVER been<br/>
in solb or Permafrost, heh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on a kind of bard hiatus lately and rather that getting Faras up<br/>
to 50 I decided to get 5 secondary characters up to 10 to check out other<br/>
classes a bit.<br/>

&gt; Damn, and you&#39;re on E&#39;ci too aren&#39;t ya Faras?  I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
&gt; the squire<br/>
&gt; either, but have &quot;seen&quot; the warden at least a dozen times.  <br/>
&gt; Speaking of<br/>
&gt; troublesome spawns/drops, has anyone here ever seen an <br/>
&gt; alligator skin?  I<br/>
&gt; must have killed 20 bull alligators in Innothoule this past <br/>
&gt; week and no<br/>
&gt; skins.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What other ranged slot options are bards out there using <br/>
&gt; besides Dragoon<br/>
&gt; Dirk and Runed Bone Fork?  I was looking to upgrade soon.<br/>
