<b>Subject:</b> My Guise of the Deceiver saga begins <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976183825">Well the &quot;Bards and cha&quot; thread and Sylly&#39;s post about how he&#39;d gotten a<br/>
guise (and the picture on his web site) made me decide I would give it a<br/>
try.  Yes I&#39;m only 29th, but I decided to try to get into the Assassin&#39;s<br/>
room in Lower Guk anyhow.  Risky?  You betcha - but I decided that I&#39;d died<br/>
before, so what the hell.  I went into the Undead side of Lower Guk and<br/>
asked if anyone was camping the Assassin.  Of course there was a group<br/>
camping him so I asked if I could come and attempt to loot a Guise if no one<br/>
else wanted it.  The groups said &quot;sure&quot;, so off I went.  Not being too<br/>
familiar with LGuk I had to ask a couple of folks to point me in the right<br/>
direction, and a kindhearted Dark Elf in the Bedroom led me to the<br/>
Assassin&#39;s room.  I didn&#39;t join the Assassin&#39;s group, I was merely waiting<br/>
on the sidelines chatting with the folks in the room and explaining yet<br/>
again that I don&#39;t get Clarity until 32nd.<br/>
<br/>
A froggie spawned and we jumped it.  I even got a decent proc off of my<br/>
Staff of Writhing on it before it fled the room.  Much to my surprise no one<br/>
had rooted or snared it, so I fired up Chains and halted it in its tracks<br/>
and we finished it off.  At this point I turn around and start to run back<br/>
to the Assassin&#39;s room (at full health) and hear myself say &quot;Yow!&quot;, hit by a<br/>
spell.  Ok, don&#39;t panic - just continue to run to the Assassin&#39;s room to get<br/>
some help from the group.  &quot;Uh oh.  Why am I moving so slowly?&quot;  I glance at<br/>
my health and I have at MOST 1/4 of a bubble left.  The next cast completely<br/>
destroys me.  If it&#39;d been Quake there would have been gibs on the ceiling.<br/>
A Tal Ghoul Wizard - someone with whom not to mess.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was 3:30am at this point so I had to log off because I had to work<br/>
today.  :-)  I actually laughed about it last night and this morning too.  I<br/>
doubt that corpse recovery will be too difficult at peak hours tonight...<br/>
We&#39;ll see!<br/>
