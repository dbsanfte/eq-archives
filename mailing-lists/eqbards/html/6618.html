&gt; Heh seems like it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes I agree Verant seems to hate powergamers very much although I doubt for<br/>
&gt; the real reasons. Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>
&gt; leaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; beaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people just<br/>
&gt; got bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>
&gt; char or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant would<br/>
&gt; add some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>
&gt; continue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>
&gt; secondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>
&gt; problems as more and more people leave.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. I think they take it personally when we kill their dragons<br/>
and make it look too easy. I don&#39;t really consider myself a powergamer<br/>
in that I didn&#39;t play just to level. I just had so much fun playing, and<br/>
had so much free time for 6 months I couldn&#39;t help but level. Going new<br/>
places, exploring new dungeons, dying a lot until you figured out how to<br/>
survive and beat the mobs in them, that was what made the game fun to<br/>
me, not racing to 50. A lot of people like to say powergamers miss big<br/>
parts of the game but I explored every zone I could. Part of why I loved<br/>
being a bard was that with Selo&#39;s we can go almost anywhere outdoors we<br/>
like and have a real good chance of surviving. A friend and I at L20<br/>
explored for days, hardly killing anything. The only zone in the game I<br/>
hadn&#39;t been in until recently was Kerra Island, and that&#39;s because I<br/>
never found the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess the kiting thing has gotten a bit out of hand in that on<br/>
some of the newer servers, people were leveling druids at rediculous<br/>
rates, but, IMO, so what? There are also people leveling lots of other<br/>
characters at astounding rates compared to the first crop of L50&#39;s on<br/>
the original servers. On The Tribunal, the newest server, there were<br/>
people selling banded on the 4th day the server was up. Heck, I was<br/>
already L16 or so when the first piece of banded went on sale on Tarrew<br/>
Marr.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is probably drifting way too off topic for this list.<br/>
