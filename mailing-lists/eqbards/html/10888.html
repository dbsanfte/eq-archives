<div id="ygrps-yiv-221287783">hehe, the shin armor is easy to get usually, other night i was there with a<br/>
group in the bedroom and we had 2 shins with pants on the ground dead. we<br/>
auctioned them to anyone needing them, then someone auctioned one in the<br/>
hallways, then another auctioned one right at the zone, you just got a bad<br/>
night, if people hunt the corridors or the zone, you will have a harder time<br/>
to get the items.<br/>

&gt; Yes, a bad night probably.  I also try advertising I am looking for the<br/>
&gt; items.  That&#39;s how I got the first one, I advertised I had non-summoned<br/>
&gt; food<br/>
&gt; and a monk immediately came up and killed the Shin knights until I got<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; I needed for 20 muffins and 20 milk.  He got no xp for the Shin but was<br/>
&gt; happy to get the real food without running to Freeport.  a simple /auction<br/>
&gt; &quot;looking for shin greaves/gauntlets that no one wants&quot; will often get the<br/>
&gt; response &quot;Will hunt for food, &lt;grin&gt;&quot;<br/>

&gt; I believe they are live froggies that got stuck with the bad job of having<br/>
&gt; to hang out on the dead side.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having read all the posts recently about getting cool stuff down in Guk, I<br/>
&gt; made my way there using an assortment of maps and directions and finally<br/>
&gt; found the entrance everyone&#39;s been talking about. Sure enough the floor<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; littered with the corpses of dead players, but no dead Shin Knight<br/>
&gt; corpses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a patient bard, as well as one that was invis and feeling quite safe,<br/>
&gt; so I sat down and waited for the dreaded trains to come bringing piles of<br/>
&gt; loot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At that point I got up and walked down to where the north-south hall<br/>
&gt; starts.. &quot;Ah a dead froggie!&quot; I loot and get some gold, but nothing else.<br/>
&gt; While I am looting another Shin Knight spawns and takes no notice of me<br/>
&gt; while I am invis or visible. I tell a friend who is familiar with Guk<br/>
&gt; asking<br/>
&gt; him if I am indeed in the right spot and if people really do train stuff<br/>
&gt; here. He confirms on both issues, so I head back to zone border and wait.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do a &quot;/who&quot; and see that indeed there are many people here, over 60 at<br/>
&gt; that point. I also realize that I am the only player here under level 30.<br/>
&gt; A<br/>
&gt; small shiver overtakes me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I start to wander down to the north-south hall again, two Shin Knights are<br/>
&gt; now there but no one is taking them on. I decide to head south towards the<br/>
&gt; river/stream to see if anyone has left something down there. I turn the<br/>
&gt; first corner to start heading east/south east when I see a dead froggie.<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; first he does nothing to me, so I &quot;/con&quot; him and it says he&#39;s ready to<br/>
&gt; attack, and to boot he&#39;s close enough. Just then as I am thinking how<br/>
&gt; fortunate I am that he&#39;s ignored me, &quot;BAM!&quot; he hits, no too hard, but<br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; he was dark red to me I make my dash back and zone. I also decide once I<br/>
&gt; have zoned that maybe I will come back another time and head back to<br/>
&gt; Freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So my question is, did I just hit Lower Guk on a bad night, or do I just<br/>
&gt; need to be more patient? This being a vulture stuff is hard :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, I guess that they are &quot;live&quot; froggies - but my froggie faction is<br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt; gone and they agro me.  Unless I fade a little (invis to undead) then<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not agro as I go by - I don&#39;t stand around waiting though.  So, I<br/>
&gt; guessed<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they were un-dead since they dint agro when I was<br/>
&gt; invised-to-undead.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Live, ded, unded?  3 distinct categories?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The regular Shin Knight Frogs are live.  They totally ignore<br/>
&gt; &gt; me when I stand<br/>
&gt; &gt; right in front of them totally visible.  Shin Ghouls on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other hand make<br/>
&gt; &gt; me run like a cry baby the instant they smell me.<br/>
