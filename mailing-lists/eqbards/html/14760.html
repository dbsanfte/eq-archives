&gt; I am pretty sure that I got mine in the &quot;bar room&quot; in Sol-A.  <br/>
&gt; We were there<br/>
&gt; about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s <br/>
&gt; rangers with us<br/>
&gt; lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at <br/>
&gt; levels 24 thru<br/>
&gt; 28 group, we got spanked.  If you can recruit some mid 30&#39;s <br/>
&gt; types you should<br/>
&gt; do pretty well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I looted from a champion (with permission of course) who was killed by<br/>
another group, over in the long corridor leading to the Fire King&#39;s room. I<br/>
never saw any of these guys at the bar room.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I died a lot here at my current level 28 just trying to get to places.<br/>
The shamans and wizards see invis and cast see invis on other mobs (I&#39;m sure<br/>
this has been mentioned before on this list, but it was a while back). I&#39;m<br/>
hoping at level 29 they won&#39;t aggro on me anymore, but not sure. I&#39;m sure<br/>
they don&#39;t aggro on level 30&#39;s. Too bad, seems like such a good place for<br/>
exp and items at my level, but I can&#39;t make it to any of the good rooms. So<br/>
you&#39;ll have to con everything and see if something is not indifferent to<br/>
you. Anything not indifferent will jump you.<br/>
