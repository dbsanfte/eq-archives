<div id="ygrps-yiv-536619138">I tend to lurk here more than post, but when I see something perfectly<br/>
written, or just asking for a reply, I cannot help but do so. This is a fine<br/>
topic, and I felt obligated to wake up and post =)<br/>
<br/>
I do like the fact of bards being one of the lesser picked classes in the<br/>
game. Not once will you do a /w in zone and see 5+ bards, like a warrior,<br/>
necro or druid.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been keen on being able to use every song in my repertoire for<br/>
one occasion or another. There are some songs I will simply NOT memorize. 39<br/>
charm and Niv&#39;s seem to be 2 of them. (I love weaving HoR and Niv&#39;s with<br/>
Kelin&#39;s 7string =) )<br/>
<br/>
Bard&#39;s movement speed was always a topic of conversation among the guild and<br/>
group channels. And you bet you life that when we were suddenly lower than<br/>
druid scum in terms of running speed, that was quite talked about too!<br/>
<br/>
I RP my bard very well, but I guess I am a pretty romantic guy IRL. I play<br/>
him to be very suave and there are many lady friends in my life. Of course,<br/>
being the wandering minstrel, one cannot tie him/herself down to one lol<br/>
<br/>
I have made lifelong friends just because I have taken 5mins of my time to<br/>
locate their corpse. Some just fell off the platforms in Kelethin (and<br/>
weren&#39;t but 5 steps from the nearest lift), some fell off cliffs in EJ or FV<br/>
and didn&#39;t know where or if it was underwater somewhere. I&#39;ve done multiple<br/>
underwater CRs in places like Everfrost, Lake Rathe, Oasis, and other places<br/>
with large open waters by simply equipping SS gaunts and firing up good ol&#39;<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s =) And it is indeed rewarding. There are very few places a bard<br/>
cannot get his/her or someone else&#39;s corpse. Icewell keep being one - this<br/>
curious lad levitated down the well and was promptly mugged. Luckily some<br/>
fine upstanding citizens were conveniently killing dorf guards and<br/>
summoned/rezzed my corpse!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure these are all great reasons to be a bard, as Windleaf stated, and I<br/>
couldn&#39;t agree more, or have put it better myself.<br/>

52 years of singing<br/>
100+ days /played (typical social and quest hungry bard)<br/>

<br/>
p.s. How many days has it taken you to make it to where you are  in your<br/>
travels?</div>
