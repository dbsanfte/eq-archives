&gt;no prob, i know its not a flame, i like the discussion.  but as far as my<br/>
&gt;character, i don&#39;t have all the spiffy items yet, and i still have fun with<br/>
&gt;her and don&#39;t see the point of retirement.  in fact, my point is that adding<br/>
&gt;new zones for level 50 characters benefits everyone else.  like i said, when<br/>
&gt;fear was open we were out of your hair.  and these aren&#39;t essentially new<br/>
&gt;zones, they have always been there and intended on opening but they haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;gotten to it yet.  opening these zones has always been in verant&#39;s plan for<br/>
&gt;the game.  so with these zones to be opening soon and the expansion, i do<br/>
&gt;think it is in verant&#39;s plans to have these characters around for a long<br/>
&gt;time.  hurry up and kabong me Talies before it&#39;s too late! =P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh - Actually, the reason I haven&#39;t kabong!ed this borderline thread is<br/>
the fact that gaining 50th *is* important to all of us, and frankly, many<br/>
of us want to know what we will be doing when we get there.  It&#39;s nice to<br/>
have a goal, but right now, I think some of us see that goal as a bit<br/>
darker for all that&#39;s been said.<br/>
<br/>
What can you tell us about 50th level that will make us want to achieve it?<br/>
