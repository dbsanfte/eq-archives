<div id="ygrps-yiv-215116349"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Well, it seems our rogue needs a Ravenscale BP and some boots. So here I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>am asking for advice camping the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>
spent a ton of time in the courtyard and a decent amount of time at 4C, top<br/>
and bottom. I&#39;ve also been to the gator pools (green and blue) and the<br/>
throne room. Specifically I&#39;m curious what dangers to watch out for (besides<br/>
the avatar himself) and any advice in so far as what songs if any are highly<br/>
effective or ineffective. (party is rogue, druid, warrior, bard and possibly<br/>
enchanter and mage, all levels 30-35)<br/>

Assuming the room is clear and your group can walk in and claim the room,<br/>
you can all meet up in the room directly off the AOF room.  This will be<br/>
your camp room.  Use invis to get there, the only thing capable of seeing<br/>
thru invis would be the AOF himself if he&#39;s in the bubble.  If he is there,<br/>
you can use the back entrance to the sewers.  Hopefully, the AOF is NOT<br/>
there right off, because it&#39;ll be a helluva job of clearing the AOF room.<br/>
Start by clearing mobs in the sewer room directly behind you.  Pull to the<br/>
camp room.  This will make your lives easier down the road in case of any<br/>
runners.  You WILL be fighting multiple mobs, so having the enchanter with<br/>
you will be nice.  I always charm if there&#39;s 3 or more mobs (and no<br/>
enchanter)... the rest of the party should obviously be assisting the main<br/>
tank.  I&#39;m assuming you guys play together all the time, so you know how to<br/>
work together. :)<br/>
<br/>
 After clearing the first sewer room, you&#39;ll want to clear the bottom of the<br/>
AOF room.  (Let&#39;s assume AOF isn&#39;t there)  Again, pull to the camp room.<br/>
Here you&#39;ll want to try staggering the spawn.  Kill the AOF PH last if you<br/>
can... and keep him charmed for a minute to give yourselves some extra time<br/>
next cycle.  You WANT to be fighting the AOF alone. :)  After you&#39;ve killed<br/>
the AOF PH, you&#39;ll pull from the sewers again, when ready.  After at least 5<br/>
minutes have gone by, you&#39;ll pull the 4 mobs on top of the Green Bubble.<br/>
Give yourselves enuf time after killing the AOF PH before killing these mobs<br/>
so they don&#39;t spawn on top of you while you fight the AOF.  This is very<br/>
important, because you will be fighting the AOF in the Bubble room.  (He&#39;s<br/>
the only mob you will fight outside the camp room)<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye on the spawn timer, I believe it&#39;s 20 mins in CT.  You&#39;ll want<br/>
to kill the sewers and mobs below the green bubble as they spawn, making<br/>
sure you&#39;re ready for the AOF spawn.  There is 1 mob that spawns in the camp<br/>
room that you can use as your &quot;Timer&quot; if you are able to kill him first.<br/>
When he spawns, you&#39;ll know to start the process over.  (I believe he<br/>
wanders, so it might not be as easy as it seems to make sure you kill him<br/>
first.)<br/>
<br/>
AOF<br/>
He&#39;s a level 37 SK and like all SK&#39;s his harm touch is a bitch.  2 Bubbles<br/>
of Bard life, if I remember correctly.  2 1/2 - 3 bubbles of Enchanter or<br/>
Mage life if they take it by mistake.  When he spawns, everyone should<br/>
collect in the hallway between the camp room and the AOF room.  The warrior<br/>
should enter the room first, drawing attention of the AOF and drawing his<br/>
HT.  Fight him in this room.  The most important thing at this point is<br/>
SNARE.  If the druid can&#39;t stick snare, then you will be ONLY playing<br/>
Chains.  He runs early and if he&#39;s not snared when he runs, you&#39;re screwed.<br/>
It&#39;s difficult to chase him thru the camp room and into the sewers.  Too<br/>
many corners to get a snare off.  If the sewers are camped, you might<br/>
live.... But, too many times our party has been wiped out trying to chase<br/>
him down.  Anyway, he might make it to the first sewer room while snared,<br/>
which is why it&#39;s extremelly important to make sure that room has been<br/>
recently cleaned out before tackling the AOF.  Also, the lizards on top of<br/>
the bubble will sometimes be healers, making it nearly impossible to kill<br/>
him if they are there.<br/>
<br/>
Both the AOF and the BP are rare.  You guys might all be 35 - 40 before you<br/>
leave, if you&#39;re unlucky.  :)  On a side note, this isn&#39;t a bad spot to go<br/>
thru 35 AND 40... Exp is great and mobs are plentiful. :)<br/>
<br/>
If the room is camped when you get there, it&#39;s obviously easier once you can<br/>
get into the group.  Usually there is a waiting list, and you can put ALL<br/>
your party on it and just work your way into the room.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Bard songs go, there is really no difference here than anywhere<br/>
else in CT.  You can use AOE songs in the camp room without worry.<br/>
