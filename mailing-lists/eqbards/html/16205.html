 </span></blockquote>I totally disagree.  If the group of 5 can handle mob X and you add a necro<br/>
who can solo mob Y, the necro can effectively fight mob Y separately while<br/>
you kill Mob X a couple of times adding to the xp of all.  For most classes<br/>
Mob Y in this example would be half the level of Mob X, for the Necro Mob Y<br/>
is 2-5 levels below Mob X at most.  Adding a Necro wisely can nearly double<br/>
the xp if the mobs are available.<br/>
