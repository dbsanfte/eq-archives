&gt; Chief Goonda, man do I how him a dozen or so deaths.  Me and a group of<br/>
&gt; friends foolishly tried to take on that ogre camp one night and then spent<br/>
&gt; the next 4 hours getting all of our corpses back :)  And this was when<br/>
&gt; shamans still had charm. I died 4 times that night, ick.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rokken, if you want to make a Goonda slaying party some night on Karana, my<br/>
party&#39;s all up for it.  We have similar scores to settle.<br/>
<br/>
In beta, a friend of mine went after Goonda and their entire party got charmed in<br/>
about 15 seconds.  The first person to snap out of it did NOT have a long life.<br/>
