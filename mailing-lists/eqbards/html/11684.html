<div id="ygrps-yiv-539084065">What happenned here is simple, you teleported to the bottom, and the<br/>
Avocet jumped off the platform and landed next to you. The birdies don&#39;t<br/>
take the path down, they just jump, and they take no damage from<br/>
falling. (haven&#39;t you seen the elephants in the birdouses before? they<br/>
drop off and are jsut fine).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, even if your plan had worked, the aviak still would have been able<br/>
to hit you from the top of the birdhouse. I played a troll SK, and after<br/>
MANY, MANY, MANY, levels of killing aviaks, (basically 17-29) they would<br/>
attack me on sight. I found that if I just went and stood at the base of<br/>
the birdhouse, the birdies would attack me, jump off and be right next<br/>
to me. needless to say, I was designated puller :).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Was fighting in the aviak roost in SK last night.  Had the 22d level<br/>
&gt; teleport song memmed so I could get down to the ground fast without having<br/>
&gt; to use the ramp.  I was in a party of three people.  The top roost was full<br/>
&gt; of spawns.   Three aviaks on the inside and an avocet on the outside.  If<br/>
&gt; you attack an aviak on the outside, sometimes the ones on the inside will<br/>
&gt; join in.  Told my party I had a neat bard trick to show them.  I lamented<br/>
&gt; the three aviaks on the inside, started singing the teleport song, and<br/>
&gt; attacked the avocet before I teleported.  I was teleported to the base of<br/>
&gt; the ramp.  Before I had time to equip my weapons, the avocet appeared right<br/>
&gt; in front of me and started to whoop my butt.  No way he had time to run all<br/>
&gt; the way down the ramp.  Also, aviaks don&#39;t fly (which is surprising) so he<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get down that way.  I assume what happened is that he teleported to<br/>
&gt; my new location.  The other two party members had not gotten to me yet and<br/>
&gt; by the time they arrived I had lost over half my health.  The avocet still<br/>
&gt; had a lot of health remaining when a rook spawned at the ramp base so we<br/>
&gt; decided to zone.  A good plan went all for naught.    <br/>
