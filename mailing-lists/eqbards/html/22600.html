<div id="ygrps-yiv-530842104">Creediki is 56th and gets 118 MR so you must be right on that. Have you <br/>
gotten one of those nifty Lyran&#39;s Lutes yet? I love that thing, not sure how <br/>
often I&#39;ll use it though once I get my SSS. Also RE: Phara Dar - Grey Suede <br/>
Boots and Robe of Azure Sky finally dropped (last week), I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve <br/>
either seen them drop or saw the pics on FoH&#39;s website. The robe itself <br/>
makes me drool and I HATE playing caster classes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;maybe it&#39;s not exactly 75%, or there is some rounding going on, but it is<br/>
&gt;between 75-80%, and does change as you level.  at 57 i get 120 MR from <br/>
&gt;psalm<br/>
&gt;of mystic shielding with SSS, 67 without, which is a 79% increase.  Thott <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;60 gets 126 MR with SSS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. cleared VP again last night, killed Phara Dar for the second time.  <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;though VI said they were not upgrading items or putting new loot in they<br/>
&gt;obviously changed their mind cause there is some incredible stuff in there<br/>
&gt;now, the caliber of items that should have always been in there and that we<br/>
&gt;expected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shada<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drool, I just heard this today as well. MR with Psalm of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mystic Shielding up<br/>
&gt; &gt; by 118 pts while wielding SSS...<br/>
