<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102725927">I don&#39;t think this is correct - at least in the little spot I was trapped -<br/>
past the lavafall -  near the lava zone to Sol B (unless there&#39;s a &quot;trick&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m unaware of.  Believe me - I tried my hardest to drag that corpse<br/>
anywhere...<br/>
<br/>
Also - maybe something got nerfed..  For example - I don&#39;t recall this<br/>
happening since the most recent Levitate Nerf (granted I haven&#39;t spent much<br/>
time levitated) but if you stay still - and are pretty high up - every few<br/>
seconds you&#39;ll start to sink...<br/>

&gt; You can drag stuff out of lava anywhere else in Sol A (you may<br/>
&gt; have to get creative with your levitate, but you can do it).<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just the section past that lavafall where you can&#39;t pull<br/>
&gt; it out.<br/>
