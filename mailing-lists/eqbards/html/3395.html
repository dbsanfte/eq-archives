I always have my dirk in my main inventory when traveling.<br/>
When I stop by a vendor, I check the price on the dirk.  If it<br/>
is not 4.286pp, I know the merchant is not giving me the best<br/>
possible prices and I hit it with the Charisma song.  If that<br/>
doesn&#39;t help, I find another merchant.<br/>

attack druids and rangers on sight.  I would dearly love to<br/>

wolves.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some merchants are just stingier than others and do not seem<br/>
to give you the best prices despite your faction.  Others will<br/>
give you the best prices even if they are indifferent to you<br/>
(if you have sufficient charisma).<br/>

only visited 3 times.<br/>
