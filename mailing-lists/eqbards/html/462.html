<div id="ygrps-yiv-57895722">If it is true that this song increases mana regeneration, this will make the<br/>
usefulness of a bard to a group even greater than they currently are.   When<br/>
you try this out on a group, tell the spellcasters to go to their Persona<br/>
screen so they can monitor how much mana they regenerate per pulse both with<br/>
and without the Jig playing.  It should be fairly easy to test the<br/>
hypothesis.  <br/>

&gt; I have seen several mentions of this song being &#39;useless&#39;, etc. Actually <br/>
&gt; several of my spellcasting friends tell me that it will cause their man to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; regen a bit faster. Now it does not perform like the high level song of <br/>
&gt; course, but many of my friends swear by it. We noticed this in beta and it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; was widely debated, but many have told me they see a difference. Next time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you are in a group, try it while the casters are medding and see if they<br/>
&gt; can <br/>
&gt; tell a difference.<br/>
