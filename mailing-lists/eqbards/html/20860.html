<div id="ygrps-yiv-670805806">I finally hit level 27 over the weekend.  It&#39;s only taken me 23 days played<br/>
over the last 12 months to get this far... I need to stop getting out more.<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
I headed back over to Kelethin to pick up Solon&#39;s and practiced for a while<br/>
on bats, wasps and Orc Pawns.  What fun!  I came across a wandering<br/>
Centurion and enthralled him.  We strolled up to Orc Hill and caused a bit<br/>
of commotion with the youngsters there.  I quickly informed them that the<br/>
Cent was my thrall, and not to dump mana on him.  If in doubt, I did a quick<br/>
/pet who the leader just for confirmation. ;)<br/>
<br/>
The hill got swarmed by Orcs and I sent my trusty pet in to help.  After it<br/>
was all over, the youngsters were cheering for Chip (as they&#39;d named him ;)<br/>
and couldn&#39;t bear to have me kill him when I wanted to move on.  Luckily, an<br/>
Enchanter came along and took over the reigns.<br/>
<br/>
I then headed into Crushbone and was greeted by a litter of corpses at the<br/>
zone!  D&#39;Vinn was out and he was kicking butt.  A quick /who showed that<br/>
there was no-one over 14 in the zone.  I found D&#39;Vinn laying into a gnome<br/>
round the first corner and quickly charmed him.  I was more surprised than<br/>
most when it stuck ;)<br/>
<br/>
So.  After *many* deaths at the hands of that wretched inkie, he was now my<br/>
most obedient slave!  I paraded him around the courtyard for a while and had<br/>
some fun with him.  When the charm broke, I&#39;d /bonk and tell him to behave<br/>
as I re-charmed.  Much hilarity was had by all.  Darish popped with an<br/>
Emissary and D&#39;Vinn was duly sent in to dispatch them.  He took a bit of a<br/>
beating, and had less than half health after the fight.  I decided to let<br/>
the charm drop and a tower group came down and finished him off as he layed<br/>
into me.  The Paladin from the group cheered as he looted the corpse...<br/>
D&#39;Vinn had had the Dirk on him the whole time!<br/>
<br/>
For sheer fun, this song has renewed my love of the game.  I know it&#39;ll<br/>
become boring fairly quickly and I&#39;ll be using it to solo and help with<br/>
group crowd control, but I had a lot of fun just messing about with my pets.<br/>
I haven&#39;t felt like this since I was a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to try this in the Arena. :)<br/>
