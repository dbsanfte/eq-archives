I&#39;d bet the NT is for customer service people. Probably running some<br/>
kind of graphical database query stuff so the CS ppl can access customer<br/>
records easily. IRIX would be for the art staff, probably for rendering,<br/>
as the artist job requirements list mostly PC type programs like 3d<br/>
studio max, so they would likely be using NT as well. Linux probably for<br/>
the programmers. They have said their world building software was<br/>
custom, so it&#39;s a toss up whether that runs on IRIX or NT (possibly<br/>
Linux as Linux has had glide libraries for several years and OGL for<br/>
about the same) If the programmers are working on Linux I&#39;d even bet<br/>
there&#39;s a partially functional linux client by this time, just cause<br/>
someone would have seen it as a challenge (plus it would save time for<br/>
the programmer for the small amount of testing they do) I know that&#39;s<br/>
how the UO linux client came about.<br/>

Brad always says he can&#39;t answer when questioned about the server set up<br/>
but employment ads can give away an awful lot I think. :)<br/>
