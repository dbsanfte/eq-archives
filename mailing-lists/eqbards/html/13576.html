<div id="ygrps-yiv-666490602"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As well, I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed, but at least one of their<br/>
&gt; &quot;emergency&quot; patchs was because they forgot to buff Vox. We killed her<br/>
&gt; after the main patch fine (got wasted by the new, improved Nagafen) but<br/>
&gt; when we went back after the next day&#39;s &quot;emergency&quot; patch, she&#39;d been<br/>
&gt; buffed up to be as evil as Nagafen was after the main patch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I got rocked by Nagafen.  And my healer couldn&#39;t cast after a few<br/>
  mins. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I took 5 AEs, 1 or 2 group heals, and a 90/225 combo. And my group <br/>
  was the last standing.  I was the only bard there, too.  &lt;sigh, sigh&gt;<br/>
  Now I&#39;ll never get those drums =o(<br/>
