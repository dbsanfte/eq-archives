<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935802043">On the other side of the coin, I hate people who when attacked by a nasty<br/>
mob proceed to lead the train into unsuspecting players in hope of<br/>
transferring the train to them.  That happened to me last night while<br/>
hunting Crocs in Oasis.  I was healing the backside of the pillar.  When<br/>
someone who was being chased proceeded to train the SG across the water<br/>
and onto the pillar.  Sheer stupdity and callousness or just panic?  I<br/>
would think it would be the former. <br/>
