 </span></blockquote>Well, I spent all the time and money required to turn myself into a <br/>
Blacksmith (skill about 140 now), and this was before you could pick a <br/>
single component off a stack with the &lt;CTRL&gt; key (one week before, <br/>
naturally), and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone on a aging server.<br/>
<br/>
The ready availability of Bronze has driven the price of Banded down so <br/>
far that I&#39;m lucky to make a plat or two per item, and the relative lack <br/>
of interest in Banded makes it take an incredibly long time to sell the <br/>
stuff.  This is not to mention the ridiculous trips you need to take to <br/>
manufacture small (and, even worse, large) banded.  Or incredible <br/>
annoyance of juggling lots of junk in your Bank inventory.  Or the long <br/>
and involved conversations you end up having with people who decide that <br/>
they really don&#39;t want anything, or who want the item at cost, or who <br/>
were pricing things out for a friend (who won&#39;t on until Thursday), or <br/>
the people who think you&#39;re ripping them off and do zone-wide /shouts <br/>
insulting your integrity...<br/>
<br/>
I think I managed to be enough in front of the wave that I made a <br/>
reasonable profit, but I sure did trade off a lot of exp to get it.  I <br/>
now sell full suits only, 125pp fixed.<br/>
