<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079110326">go check out hackersquest utility section, they have an xp chart....  We<br/>
need much more then a warrior. Im just curious if we&#39;re considering a &quot;int<br/>
caster&quot; or a &quot;hybrid&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Experience Penalties - Implementation <br/>
<br/>
Though people often refer to the class-based penalties as the &#39;Hybrid<br/>
Penalty&#39;, most classes have a penalty. Hybrids just have the largest. A<br/>
hybrid requires 40% more experience to level than standard, Monks require<br/>
20% more, and Intelligence casters require 10% additional experience. <br/>

Might even experience a slight influx in the number of warriors and rogues.<br/>
Heck...even I have always wanted to be a pure tank from time to time.  :)<br/>

I think he is refering to warriors and rogues.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon:<br/>
5. Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also<br/>
not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we&#39;ve<br/>
decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be<br/>
unbalancing. Bottom line: we don&#39;t feel the bonus is enough to warrant a fix<br/>
that could be interpreted as a &#39;nerf&#39;.<br/>

&gt;&gt; For details on the removal of the hybrid exp penalty<br/>
&gt;&gt; (sort of) look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">http://eq.castersrealm.com</a><br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lest we forget that verant has stated bards are not hybrids.....<br/>
&gt;also look at this I clipped from the post<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a balance issue we decided was also necessary to address. If we are<br/>
&gt;going to make the statement that class experience penalties should not<br/>
&gt;exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with exception to the two<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;How much you wanna bet that bards will be one of the &quot;as-is&quot; classes.<br/>
