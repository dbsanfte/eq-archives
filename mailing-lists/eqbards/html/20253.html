&gt;Hey!  That was you!  I knew it started with an O, but I was honestly so<br/>
&gt;disgusted with my guildmates ridiculous antics I couldn&#39;t think straight.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s the first time I have ever just camped from a group without so much<br/>
&gt;as a see ya later.  I did warn them beforehand and told the other poor<br/>
&gt;unfortunate caught in their stupidity I was leaving.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe, actually I got into a similar group this morning in Lower Guk.  They <br/>
were so pitiful I couldn&#39;t believe it.  After recovering my corpse, I just <br/>
logged in disgust and went to clean the house and do laundry...  More fun <br/>
than fighting with them... lol<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey on a side note Olgwinn, do you, or anyone out there in fact, know what<br/>
&gt;level the scorponids in The Overthere are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Kitasi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Scorpicus are between level 30 and 35 I think.  And they are SK&#39;s, which <br/>
means harm touch and low level necro spells.  They also give bad Venril <br/>
Sather faction, so use care in case you happen to run into the evil outpost <br/>
for groceries (which are expensive as hell, anyone else notice that???)  I <br/>
assume you are interested in the scorpicus scrounger for the Nostrolo <br/>
Tambourine quest.  Well, in case it helps, the other day I and a level 42 <br/>
wizzie killed one.  Basically I ran over to where the chasm starts (where <br/>
they live), tracked the nearest Scorpicus Scrounger, and ran in with Selos <br/>
and Elemental Rythms going.  Tagged him (and another unfortunately decided <br/>
to join, although the rest left me alone) and carefully drew him out towards <br/>
the zone where my wizzie was waiting.  Keep Selos going (just in case), but <br/>
go slowly or you will lose it.  Also keep Elemental Rythms going to protect <br/>
you from the stuff he&#39;ll try to hit you with.  We finished it off fairly <br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
First one I pulled up had a coin.  Case closed.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and a level 41 bard ran into me at the zone Friday night and said, &quot;Hey, <br/>
it&#39;s Olgwinn from the eq bards list!&quot;  hehe<br/>
