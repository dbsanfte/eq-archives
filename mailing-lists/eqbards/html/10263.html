<div id="ygrps-yiv-175670693">Terrific idea Bernwyn!  This would be one quest I would definitely work on.<br/>
As quests go it would be similar to the Trueshot bow quest, which is time<br/>
consuming and tiring but if successful yeilds an excellent item.  Did you<br/>
mean that a bard would have to personally visit each place to get part of<br/>
the song sheet, meaning the song sheets are no drop?  That&#39;s the way I&#39;d<br/>
like to see it.  Something as valuable as this potential song should not be<br/>
bought, it should be personally earned.  Sounds like the perfect diversion<br/>
for Lakosh when he hits his mid-life crisis since he can&#39;t buy a sports car<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
You got my vote!<br/>

&gt; I would like to see the addition of high level group gate song with it&#39;s<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; special twist like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead of gating your party to druid ruins, or some strange magical site,<br/>
&gt; the bard group gate would teleport everyone to one of the many Inns or<br/>
&gt; Tavern in Norath. This may be in a city, out on the country along a road,<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; even out to places like the Ocean of Tears.  In order to get the song, you<br/>
&gt; would have to do a world-wide quest to visit each of these places and get<br/>
&gt; each one&#39;s verses (which may spawn many sub-quests) that would comprise<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; final song which would be created from the combined verses at the end of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The actual mechanics of the song would be to begin singing it, and then<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; a dialog or portion of the interface display the choices of where you<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; like to be taken (kind of like a ranger&#39;s tracking screen). As a balancing<br/>
&gt; mechanism, once everyone in the party had been teleported they would all<br/>
&gt; roll against their alcohol tolerance skill to see how disoriented the<br/>
songs<br/>
&gt; intoxicating lyrics had made them. Those that fail will stumble around<br/>
drunk<br/>
&gt; for a time until it wears off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
