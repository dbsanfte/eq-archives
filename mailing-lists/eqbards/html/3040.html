<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119860193">I&#39;ll answer what I can.  I don&#39;t twist clarity ever.  By the time we get<br/>
level 32, giving your cleric, druid, or shaman healers mana so they can do<br/>
the healing is faster than you healing your party.  Also the song stacks<br/>
with all other bards singing it in your party, and with the clarity spell of<br/>
enchanters.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Hello everyone.  Recently I read a post online claiming <br/>
&gt; that this<br/>
&gt; song does not last for a certain ticks like all our other <br/>
&gt; buff songs do.  <br/>
&gt; (For example, you can twist healing, jig, anthem on a good day without<br/>
&gt; losing any song effect)  However, that person claims that the <br/>
&gt; effect of<br/>
&gt; clarity kicks in whenever the message &quot;your mind clears&quot; is <br/>
&gt; displayed and<br/>
&gt; as soon as you stop singing the song, it no longer helps mana <br/>
&gt; regen.  Can<br/>
&gt; anyone confirm this?  I&#39;ve always twisted clarity with <br/>
&gt; healing to minimize<br/>
&gt; downtime, but if clarity does have this rather unique <br/>
&gt; property, I might<br/>
&gt; have to change my tactics.  I wonder why this song does not display an<br/>
&gt; icon like all our other buff songs do.<br/>
&gt; 	I would also love to find out whether clarity gives a<br/>
&gt; caster a certain amount of mana back per pulse or double <br/>
&gt; his/her amount of<br/>
&gt; mana gained while medding.  I have heard reports that <br/>
&gt; multiple bards in a<br/>
&gt; party can all sing this song to super charge mana for <br/>
&gt; casters.  Does that<br/>
&gt; one instance of one bard song per party rule not aply to this <br/>
&gt; song either?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
