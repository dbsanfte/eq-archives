<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253158307"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ...The wizard is much more difficult to play than the bard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s only as hard as you make it.  <br/>
<br/>
  Still, saying that a wizard is much harder, when the wizards<br/>
  I&#39;ve started all say low difficulty seems to contradict your<br/>
  opinion (in the designer&#39;s mind).  The wizard has two goals in life:<br/>
  <br/>
  1) Stay alive.<br/>
  2) Nuke the crap out of things.<br/>
<br/>
  Wizards have no technicalities to deal with, no decisions to<br/>
  make on the fly.  They wait til X mob is at a certain health <br/>
  and blast it.  I believe wizards are right above warriors in<br/>
  difficulty of play, that being easy.  Bards are below enchanters <br/>
  as far as difficulty of play on the opposite spectrum, which is<br/>
  hard.  The only thing that&#39;s hard for wizards is to comprehend<br/>
  they aren&#39;t the soloing class they used to be.  I rarely group<br/>
  with wizards as they&#39;re not necessary for most of my groups to <br/>
  function nominally.  I&#39;d most likely pick a utility caster: <br/>
  druid or shaman, rather than a wizard.  Just not into the sheer<br/>
  damage factor, which can most often be resisted partially or<br/>
  fully.  I&#39;ve never seen a warrior&#39;s axe or boot get resisted. ;)<br/>
<br/>
  On a side note, when the sh*t hits the fan, I do like having<br/>
  a wizard around to drop something really fast.  But other than<br/>
  bringing along IC casters for dragon/plane raids, I generally<br/>
  stay away from wizards.<br/>
