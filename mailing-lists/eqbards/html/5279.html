&gt; Well, I went out and bought my steele breastplate this<br/>
&gt; weekend.  I had a charisma of 118 and bought it from<br/>
&gt; Kelethin, my home city, I got it for about 757pp.  My<br/>
&gt; ranger friend checked what his price would be just to<br/>
&gt; see, and it was over 900 for him.  Also I noticed that<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t size specific.  No medium or large to it.<br/>
&gt; Pretty cool, eh?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure you won&#39;t be too happy about this when you look more closely<br/>
at it... Kelethin sells MEDIUM plate (and chain and leather and banded<br/>
molds) for some reason.  Wood elves can wear medium, but they SHOULD wear<br/>
small.  For small plate, you have to buy in Rivervale or Kaladim or Akanon.<br/>
If you check the races that can wear the plate, I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s the<br/>
medium races.<br/>
<br/>
Unless there has been a wonderful change lately.<br/>
