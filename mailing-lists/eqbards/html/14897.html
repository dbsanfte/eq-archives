<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, there was one mistake in your post.  Not certain if it warrants <br/>
&gt;posting a correction to the thread.  You listed Lullaby as the level 16 <br/>
&gt;song.  Its the level 15 song.  Level 16 is the underwater breathing song.  <br/>
&gt;I would hope Verant knew you were talking about the level 15 song but you <br/>
&gt;never know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>New response from Verant:<br/>
<br/>
Extensive in-house testing has revealed that the 16th bard song, Tarew&#39;s <br/>
Aquatic Ayre, is working exactly as designed.  This thread is now closed.  <br/>
Thank you, have a nice day.<br/>
