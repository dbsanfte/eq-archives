<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260355032">I bought the game a few days after my friend did.  We were at his house doing a /who all &lt;class&gt; for each of the classes, and I saw that Bards and Rogues had the fewest.  Being a contrarian, I figured it would be cool to play one of the uncommon classes, and I&#39;d always been a Rogue/Thief in FTF gaming, so I figured I&#39;d try something a little different.  My Bard is my first character.<br/>

When I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
