&gt;Left Goblin Ears in Highpass Keep, when turned into Captain Bosec<br/>
&gt;with give you faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos AND the<br/>
&gt;Freeport Militia and a few others. You do NOT take a hit with<br/>
&gt;the good Freeport guards or the good Qeynos guards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I belive Orc scalps turned into the Volunteer (sp?) in Highpass<br/>
&gt;itself will do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since I spent from level 22-32 in HighPass Keep, I had over 200<br/>
&gt;ears saved up. I gave them all to a Paladin who was KOS, and<br/>
&gt;it got her to dubious. (from scowls I beleive)<br/>

&gt;PS. I am offering 50pp for each RIGHT goblin ear, please contact<br/>
&gt;me =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PPS. As for the why you&#39;d want to kill him..<br/>
&gt; When you are young, and starting out, the 50-100pp you<br/>
&gt; got for selling the Bloodforge Hammer was a SUBSTATIONAL<br/>
&gt; amount of money. (Think back to your first level 10 or so<br/>
&gt; character and how broke you were!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>
&gt;&gt; is not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Repairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>
&gt;&gt; enough (visit Blackburrow).  But everything I&#39;ve found that<br/>
&gt;&gt; raises your faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos also<br/>
&gt;&gt; lowers it with the non-corrupt guards.<br/>
