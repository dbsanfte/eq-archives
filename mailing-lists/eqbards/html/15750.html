<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714586786">I ventured out of Sol A at 32 thinking the same thing.  I found every other<br/>
dungeon so camped that I went back into Sol A and didn&#39;t come out again<br/>
until 37/38.  Sol A rocks compared to everywhere else.  Wish the rest of<br/>
them were as much fun and as easy to get a spot in...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been well inundated with the notion that Lower Guk and Sol B will be<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; home from 35 up since there are very few other places to be. My reasons<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; going to guk were two fold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I had to go just because I felt I would be able to do something there.<br/>
&gt; Things went very well for me and I made half a bubble of my first hell<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; in a little over an hour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) I wanted to kill the gargoyle to get my basalt carapace first hand.<br/>
&gt; (which I did) I&#39;m a firm believer in earning my equipment. Besides,<br/>
lambent<br/>
&gt; BPs go for 1000-1500 p on my server, and I just don&#39;t have the cash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Generally I tend to aviod the crowded areas of the server. Although since<br/>
&gt; the tribunal is a fairly new server, it isn&#39;t all that crowded yet. (40<br/>
&gt; people in lower guk on friday night, 30 in sol b)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the last 5 levels I&#39;ve been a sol a junkie. This is one of the most<br/>
&gt; underused zones in the game. The most I&#39;ve ever seen in the zone were 25<br/>
&gt; people. Also, if you have a good group and a good puller, the exp flows so<br/>
&gt; fast you have trouble keeping your skills maxed. (I made levels 25, 26, 28<br/>
&gt; in one day each) My current plan is to stay in sol a until I hit 32 or I<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; my firewalker boots. Once I hit 32 I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be accepted everywhere,<br/>
&gt; so I&#39;ll probably venture over to MM and try to get my instruments and<br/>
finish<br/>
&gt; off my lambent BP. Depending on how camped the castle is on my server I<br/>
may<br/>
&gt; stay and try to get a pair of EBWs. (I figure that ought to be good for at<br/>
&gt; least 3-4 levels) Then I&#39;ll be ready to hit L Guk, Sol B or Kedge. Of<br/>
course<br/>
&gt; if I find someplace less crowded, then I&#39;ll convince my group to follow<br/>
me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, that&#39;s the plan at least. We&#39;ll see how it works out. ;┬¼ )<br/>

&gt; Congratulations on level 30!  It&#39;s not long now until 32 when you&#39;ll<br/>
become<br/>
&gt; every caster&#39;s friend.  ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s excellent that you explored some of Lower Guk, it&#39;s a fun place,<br/>
&gt; however, I&#39;d like to offer a friendly word of advice.  Go elsewhere until<br/>
&gt; you get 35th or so (Cazic-Thule, Rathe Mts., Mistmoore, Paw), because from<br/>
&gt; 35th up about the only places you can go routinely for experience are<br/>
Lower<br/>
&gt; Guk, Sol B and occassionally Mistmoore and Paw.  Believe me when I say<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you will get VERY VERY tired of these zones, and the earlier you start<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; there the sooner you get tired of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to Mistmoore, I do have some tips for getting drums.  I don&#39;t have time<br/>
&gt; to type it up and the moment (cause I&#39;m damn longwinded as we all know),<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I will do so today and post what I know.  That&#39;s an interesting camp.<br/>
