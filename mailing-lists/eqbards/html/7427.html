 </span></blockquote>Very good point.  From what I have gathered, it seems the biggest complaint<br/>
about giving a melee class the ability to bind, or be bound by a caster, is<br/>
that it would change the fighting dynamic.  And it obviously would.  That<br/>
being said, the one major point that has not been proposed by other players<br/>
is a sense of difficulty or loss with getting a melee player bound.<br/>
<br/>
Add in song difficulty and reagents, coupled with real EXP loss to the<br/>
person getting bound (2 full bubbles of lost exp would really make a melee<br/>
person question getting bound or not, of course the song singer should take<br/>
considerable less exp loss :=) ). and the argument becomes less clear.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.</div>
