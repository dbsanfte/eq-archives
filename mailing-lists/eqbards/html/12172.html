<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869280592">If you camp the BR, you can pull to the room between room spawns.  I used<br/>
the right side hall and pulled vampire bat&#39;s.  Then went to the right again<br/>
and saw a hall to some deadly black widows. Pulled them using lament -<br/>
worked good and if you get 3 bugs that&#39;s nowhere near as bad as 5 GIBS.  But<br/>
me being careful I spent the time to pull singles (well ok I did get a<br/>
couple doubles.)<br/>
<br/>
But what I wanna know is where are the basalt gargs?  Did I not go deep<br/>
enough or is there a secret door/illusionary wall?<br/>

		There are two paths leading out of the BR and they both very<br/>
shortly empty<br/>
		into the same room.  This room, the &quot;bat room&quot;, has a<br/>
passage leading off to<br/>
		the left and to the right.  Most people are heading left as<br/>
that takes you<br/>
		over toward the assassin, etc. and most of lower guk.  The<br/>
bat room room has<br/>
		a couple of frog spawns and some sonic bats.  Here&#39;s the<br/>
tricky part.  The<br/>
		invis vs undead that you got at the zone doesn&#39;t help you<br/>
with the bats,<br/>
		only the frogs, however, if you hug the wall going left<br/>
pretty tightly then<br/>
		the bats won&#39;t agro on you.</div>
