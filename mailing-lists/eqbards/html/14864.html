  PS&gt; Good attitudes don&#39;t get problems fixed, or bugs repaired =)<br/>
      I&#39;m not a dreamer, I&#39;m a results kind of person.  If people<br/>
      want to shrug off problems so they can use EQ as their IRC<br/>
      with avatars that&#39;s cool, and I respect that.  But some people<br/>
      are trying to actually play the game and accomplish some more<br/>
      tangible goals.  Keep that in mind. ;)</div>
