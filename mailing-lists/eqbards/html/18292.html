<div id="ygrps-yiv-432855878">Not true.  We got jumped by a Spectral Knight in Karnor&#39;s last night at zone.  Always fun to have a level<br/>
51 mob that can summon (conned yellow to me and white to the other level 51 bard in the party) trained to<br/>
zone.  It kept summoning people back to it as they ran for zone.  Not a pretty picture.  The level 51<br/>
bard and I took turns charming it to cover everyone&#39;s escape.  While I did get more resists then I&#39;m used<br/>
to, the level 39 song certainly did stick and had our cleric not gone down from the initial train, we<br/>
probably would have stuck it out and used it as a pet.<br/>
