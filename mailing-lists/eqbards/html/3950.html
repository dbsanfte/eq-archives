&gt;      Fix.  Randomly put the good stuff on different High level mobs.  Then <br/>
&gt;      have them appear randomly in their zone.  Simple. (maybe not to <br/>
&gt;      program but that&#39;s not my problem)  Why does only the avatar (?) get <br/>
&gt;      the ruby Breastplate, and doesn&#39;t he ever go to the bathroom, or take <br/>
&gt;      a stroll around his domain?  Visit his friends or check out why his <br/>
&gt;      guards are letting these hoards of uptight homicidal maniacs into his <br/>
&gt;      throne room...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect they do this already.  I was playing in Unrest in<br/>
the morning once, with about 12 people in the zone.  The<br/>
Knight of Unrest and hags and I think even the barkeep once<br/>
would regularly roam the yard around the house.  These were<br/>
not trains or returning trains.  They were &quot;making the<br/>
rounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The problem is their spawn points are fixed, and campers kill<br/>
them long before they start to wander.  What&#39;s needed is for<br/>
the spawn locations to be randomized, like with the Warlord in<br/>
Crushbone (and even he is not sufficiently randomized as I<br/>
often see people camping one of several spots where he shows<br/>
up).  If they can&#39;t do that, then they need to randomize the<br/>
spawn times so you can&#39;t separate the spawns out in time to<br/>
where it&#39;s safe to camp the room.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;       I HATE camping.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Brad McQuaid said something about these named mobs being<br/>
nice prizes for people who explore areas?  Good in theory, but<br/>
in practice it&#39;s the campers who get all the nice prizes.  <br/>
Folks who explore and sweep dungeons get all the crap loot<br/>
Verant thoughtfully puts on &quot;lesser&quot; mobs (gee, you don&#39;t<br/>
think *that* could have anything to do with people camping,<br/>
huh?), and when they do run across an area where a named mob<br/>
*should* be, it&#39;s camped.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      the good loot is.  So I hang with him about half the time and rack up <br/>
&gt;      the money and then I buy what I want when I have the Plat.  Much more <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only buy items from people whom I know don&#39;t camp for the<br/>
sole purpose of getting items to sell.  Otherwise I&#39;m just<br/>
encouraging harvesting camping.  I&#39;ve even thought of<br/>
suggesting that unless you or your party did *all* of the<br/>
damage to a mob, if an item is unusable by your class, you<br/>
can&#39;t loot it.  It would suck in some cases, but it would<br/>
completely localize the caster kill-stealing problem to<br/>
caster-usable items.<br/>
