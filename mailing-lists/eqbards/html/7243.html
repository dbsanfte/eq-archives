 </span></blockquote>As your level increases, more languages appear to be trained.  I check<br/>
back every few levels to see if any additional ones appeared.  A few came<br/>
in at 5, then a few more around 10, more still somewhere between 10 and<br/>
20, and at 20 most of the &quot;standard&quot; race languages were available for<br/>
training (gnomish, elvish, etc).  I&#39;d love to train them someday, but no<br/>
doubt it would take a while by someone who does know it (don&#39;t know if<br/>
it&#39;s possible to raise skill simply by speaking in it).  After about 20<br/>
minutes of nonstop spamming from a 6-line /g social, my Elvish is &quot;very<br/>
good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that you must zone before language improvements take effect, at least<br/>
from learning by ear.<br/>
<br/>
And you wondered what to do with all your practice points. -.-<br/>
