<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-61223770">Over the weekend, a new email virus came out, and of this morning we have<br/>
had several cases of users being affected by this virus. Below is the<br/>
information from Symantec.<br/>
<br/>
W32.Myparty@mm is a mass-mailing email worm. The worm arrives via email<br/>
with the following characteristics:<br/>
<br/>
Subject: new photos from my party!<br/>
Body:<br/>
Hello!<br/>
My party... It was absolutely amazing!<br/>
I have attached my web page with new photos!<br/>
If you can please make color prints of my photos. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Attachment name: www.myparty.yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
The worm emails everyone in the Windows Address Book and by searching for<br/>
email addresses in Outlook Express inboxes and folders.<br/>
In addition, the worm sends a message to the author allowing him to track<br/>
the worm.<br/>
Finally, the worm may launch your webbrowser to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.disney.com">http://www.disney.com</a> if<br/>
the filename is &#39;access&#39; with any extension.<br/>
