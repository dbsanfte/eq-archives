<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588186363">I got mine in the upper 20&#39;s.  Actually, I was incredibly lucky.  There were<br/>
only two other people in Paw, a ranger and a cleric.  The ranger was maxxed,<br/>
and the cleric was his alt that he was power-leveling.  He asked me if I<br/>
wanted a Kisch, and after he told me that stats, I jumped at the chance.  I<br/>
invis&#39;d and met him (and his cleric) at his spot in the open area just<br/>
outside near the first door into that old captain&#39;s area.  After 2 or 3<br/>
spawns, he tells me to loot, and -=presto!=-  I am Kisch&#39;d  :o)  Right time,<br/>
right place.<br/>

&gt; Going for a Kisch at 19??  All I can say is...if you pull that off,<br/>
&gt; you are definetly Super Bard in my book!!  It took me at 30ish<br/>
&gt; something with a 50 Enchanter, 48 Paladin, and a 40ish something Mage<br/>
&gt; to take obtain my Kisch.  It&#39;s all the other gnolls in the room as<br/>
&gt; well that make it a tough battle.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There are some Right of Passage places I was forgetting too, like<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oooh, and the Kisch der Pavz....gotta give it a try once I get hit<br/>
