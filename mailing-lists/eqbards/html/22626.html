<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-6397166">Has anyone else noticed that you can now sneak while playing selo&#39;s?   You <br/>
actually go a little slower, but I wonder if this actually works (ie. fast <br/>
sneaking).  But then again I never could quite get the hang of sneak...  All <br/>
the mobs seem to want to hang out with their backs to walls...<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and you can hide while playing songs as well.<br/>

&gt;Patch process complete.<br/>
&gt;**********************************************************************<br/>

&gt;November 21st, 3:00am<br/>
&gt;------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*Patch Day*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today&#39;s patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last<br/>
&gt;week&#39;s big patch.  The following changes were made:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum<br/>
&gt;or below the minimum.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of<br/>
&gt;the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified<br/>
&gt;whenever the volume slider was moved.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association<br/>
&gt;with mipmapping.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the<br/>
&gt;wrong slot.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those<br/>
&gt;carried by dwarves.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of<br/>
&gt;experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that<br/>
&gt;would do around one million points of damage if left to its<br/>
&gt;own devices.<br/>
&gt;- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable<br/>
&gt;by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up<br/>
&gt;following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god<br/>
&gt;of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name<br/>
&gt;if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing<br/>
&gt;&quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- The EverQuest Team<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just hope they didn&#39;t mess with invis song and sneak/hide breakage.<br/>
&gt;If anyone gets on(I didn&#39;t), let us know anything you discover.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
