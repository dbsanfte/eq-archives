<div id="ygrps-yiv-427275822">That is generally true, although the damage bonus does not become too<br/>
significant until higher levels.  At level 32 in your case, you should<br/>
switch slots.  By the time you get high enough level where damage bonus<br/>
is significant, you will have a better fast weapon than your Sainy&#39;s<br/>
Claw.<br/>

I have always heard (my bro is a ranger and follows the ranger board<br/>
closely) that you want your fastest weapon in your primary to be able to<br/>
get<br/>
your damage bonus as often as possible and that in your secondary slow<br/>
ratio<br/>
is what you want to follow (as your secondary does not get damage<br/>
bonus).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using a 6/19 in primary (Sainy&#39;s claw) and a 13/26 (Flameweaver) in<br/>
secondary.<br/>
