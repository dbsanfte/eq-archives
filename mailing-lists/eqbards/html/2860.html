&gt;This is assuming I ever get my Piercing skill up to snuff.  I need to<br/>
&gt;find somewhere quiet with blue critters about to practice on, since<br/>
&gt;in populated areas people keep trying to &quot;save&quot; me... heh.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been kind of &quot;forced&quot; into recovering my piercing skill at 16.<br/>
<br/>
I was zoning out of befallen, and my system locked.  Reset, log<br/>
back in, and what do you know, I&#39;m in a room with cat pictures<br/>
lining the walls, I can hear ooc&#39;s in the West Commonlands, and <br/>
my inventory is EMPTY.  I&#39;d just bough my banded tunic, and a<br/>
dwarven axe (great 1hs btw).  I missed out on two opportunties<br/>
to purchase a Dragoon Dirk (fortunately).<br/>
<br/>
So, there I am, rescued by a GM, and naked as the day I was<br/>
born.  In the bank I still had my Snakeskin Jerkin, a rapier I&#39;d<br/>
purchased with the notion of improving my piercing, a spare<br/>
drum and my sewing kit.<br/>
<br/>
The GM tells me he&#39;ll put in a request for a &quot;leg up&quot; kit, like<br/>
that&#39;ll do me much good.  He couldn&#39;t even guarantee I&#39;d get<br/>
it.  GRRRRRRRR<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already picked up two derv rings, and made a couple of<br/>
pieces of PW, as well as picked up a parrying dagger.  By the<br/>
time they get a hold of me, I&#39;ll  have easily outstripped the <br/>
leg up kit, worthless as it is.  Shoot, with my drum and some<br/>
patience I can turn the mail quests into some decent change.<br/>
<br/>
After looking at my guy with a rapier and parrying dagger in hand,<br/>
I&#39;ve decided I HAVE to go with Dragoon Dirk/Combine Rapier for<br/>
a combo at 17.  Just too neat :)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting note, I lost the Items in my inventory, but not my cash<br/>
/em has a perplexed look<br/>
<br/>
All told, I probably lost 60-80 pp worth of stuff.  If I&#39;d held off for <br/>
just a day more on my spending spree (I was in qeynos, and headed<br/>
for Kelethin when I made 16 so I could get Aquatic Ayre, Lullaby,<br/>
and I hoped to get a dirk) I&#39;d have lost 20 odd plat less.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well, mail runs, Darkweed snakes and kiting wisps till I find<br/>
a new greater lightstone.<br/>
<br/>
Tindayen, the underequipped bard of povar (did wonders<br/>
for my weight though)</div>
