<div id="ygrps-yiv-914415955">agreed.  on all of our raids, only those who can use an item are in on the<br/>
lotto.  now he could have traded to get mithril arms and legs, and mostl<br/>
likely as you said he had only bp and bracers.  the question is, if he has<br/>
this stuff why not just use that on his bard instead of lambent?  the bp&#39;s<br/>
are a toss-up, but the arms and legs kill lambent and would look better with<br/>
a mith bp anyway.  i woulda liked to see exactly what the wiz had.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Mithril Breastplate = hella good<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mithril Bracers = ok.  great for wisdom using casters.  <br/>
&gt; great trade item<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   they arent that good.  easy to acquire too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Runed Mithril Tunic = good for wisdom using casters.  ok trade item<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   this isn&#39;t at all good for a bard.  plus you aren&#39;t likely to see<br/>
&gt;   many of these.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mithril Greaves = hella good<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mithril Vambraces = hella good<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   huh?????  I am willing to bet oh, about 5k pp that this wizard<br/>
&gt;   didn&#39;t intend on, nor had either of these to trade.  Just a hunch.<br/>
&gt;   No wizard gets these items when raiding Tranix.  That would be <br/>
&gt;   incredibly stupid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This wizard had one too many bracers from lucky randoms in the<br/>
&gt;   king room.  And maybe a bp in the bank he wanted to get rid of<br/>
&gt;   so he could pick up another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harm. </span></blockquote></div>
