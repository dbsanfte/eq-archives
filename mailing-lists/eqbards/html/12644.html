<div id="ygrps-yiv-468988924">Ah, I forgot about Misty Thicket! Good advice! I brought up my halfing druid<br/>
here and totally forgot about this place for other classes. No kidding about<br/>
the guards though. Keep your kills away from them. There&#39;s so much to hunt<br/>
in Misty that once the guards go off and chase down 1 creature, they aggro<br/>
on another, and another, and another and are soon pretty far away from their<br/>
posts.<br/>
<br/>
Around level 10 you can start taking out Mooto, gobbo who runs around<br/>
buffing the other goblins in the zone. The orc camp in the corner is good<br/>
too once you get high enough. Turn in Orc belts to Deputy Budo (in a tower<br/>
in the wall) and the warbeads to the sheriff in Rivervale to help your<br/>
faction.<br/>
<br/>
You can sometimes sell to the merchants through the windows of their<br/>
buildings to save yourself from some of that crouching. :-)<br/>

&gt; Hail All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was in my single digit levels I found Misty Thicket to <br/>
&gt; be a great<br/>
&gt; place as a Bard.  There are lots of goblins to kill and you <br/>
&gt; can easily solo<br/>
&gt; several camps with Selos.  Remember to  keep turning in the Runnyeye<br/>
&gt; Warbeads even if they don&#39;t give you xps right away.  Eventually after<br/>
&gt; killing enough goblins the halflings will warm up to you and <br/>
&gt; start giving<br/>
&gt; you xps for the beads.  The only downsides are you have to get through<br/>
&gt; Kithicor Forest, The halfling guards as spastic about <br/>
&gt; stealing your kills<br/>
&gt; and all that crouching makes your back ache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found Misty Thicket to be a great beginning area.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling <br/>
&gt; &gt; areas for a <br/>
&gt; &gt; semi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as <br/>
&gt; &gt; intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>
