<div id="ygrps-yiv-859899618">see my other report (HG investigation).  i have found many melee classes<br/>
capable of doing what you claim can &quot;never&quot; happen or is 1 in a million<br/>
chance of occurring.  and yes!  equipment absolutely defines the melee<br/>
classes.  a naked warrior can do nothing, while a naked wizard can do<br/>
everything.  my point being... i have no point.  oh yes, my point being that<br/>
you must accept the truth and stop clinging to your skepticism regarding<br/>
this case.  it is possible for the great Scully to be wrong!  and in this<br/>
case, you are.  you say something can &quot;never&quot; happen, i show you it can, and<br/>
in the way you implied, straight melee toe to toe battle.  there were no<br/>
provisions in your statement about equipment or armor, whereas i know that<br/>
is the turning point in every fight for a melee class.  not that skills<br/>
aren&#39;t important as well.  even with bardstorm, sword of the ass-kicking, we<br/>
don&#39;t have the defensive skills to do this.  skills+equipment=HG dead by<br/>
melee class.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My point being, we&#39;re investigating a case here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I am dedicated to objectivity and common sense, while still <br/>
&gt;   staying open to extreme possibilities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Clearly, if a one weapon makes the difference in the ability <br/>
&gt;   to tackle a hill giant by oneself, you would question whether<br/>
&gt;   that class itself is balanced in relation to the npc.  Most <br/>
&gt;   warriors are not wielding Monsoon, Sword of the Swiftwind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If Bladestorm or Monsoon are the turning point in the battle,<br/>
&gt;   then I&#39;m not sure it becomes the class&#39; skill which is winning,<br/>
&gt;   rather an extremely rare highpowered weapon which is winning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If I had Bardstorm, Sword of the Asskicking I could probably <br/>
&gt;   solo a hill giant too. ;-)<br/>
