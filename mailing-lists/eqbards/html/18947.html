have been thinking heavily of travelling to Kunark.  At the moment, my<br/>
druid hubby and I are taking a whirlwind tour of Antonica to gather my<br/>
upcoming songs (up to level 18) and to have a taste of what the<br/>
continent has to offer before taking the long boat ride.  We fought in<br/>
N. Karana the last couple of days, and will probably go visit<br/>
Lavastorm next.  We fought plenty of caimans in the Oasis at level 12,<br/>
so will probably not visit there this time around.  Our plans in<br/>
Kunark are to travel to the Fields of Bone.  I just hope we survive<br/>
the run getting there.<br/>
<br/>
Waladen, as I am also on Luclin, send me a tell.  Who knows, maybe we<br/>
can venture into Kunark together?<br/>
