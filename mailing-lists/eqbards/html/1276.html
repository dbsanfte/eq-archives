<div id="ygrps-yiv-232335234">I haven&#39;t had first hand experience with Kelin&#39;s Lullaby since I&#39;m only leve <br/>
13, but I have seen it up close...<br/>
<br/>
About 5 levels ago (a month or two), I got a bit too curious and fell down <br/>
the hole on the first floor of Befallen.  Needless to say, the greater <br/>
skeleton, ghoul, and willowisp killed me rather quickly.  After returning to <br/>
Befallen, a group which was comprised of people from a guild called The <br/>
Mystical Order (thanks a lot, by the way) helped me retrieve my corpse.  On <br/>
the way back, their bard (around level 18) used the lullaby to sleep 4 ghouls <br/>
while the other party members killed them and led me to safety.  Judging from <br/>
what I saw, I think that lullaby could work in dungeons.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do way better in outdoor zones, because in a dungeon not only can I not<br/>
 run, but I am afraid to use my really cool area effect songs (The Level 15<br/>
 Lullaby, The Level 20 Weakening Song, to name a few).<br/>
 <br/>
 Has anyone used these kind of songs in a dungeon, and if so what was the<br/>
 result? Killing your group? &gt;&gt;</div>
