<div id="ygrps-yiv-276760457"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; While what you did may have been warranted, isn&#39;t purposely dropping a train<br/>
&gt; on someone a bannable offense? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bannable or not, do you really want to lower yourself to<br/>
their level? Ignore, Petition, Go Elsewhere. Too bad there<br/>
isn&#39;t an Enemies list to match the Friends list -- &quot;if anyone<br/>
on this list appears, inform me so I can take appropriately<br/>
evasive action&quot;  -- with the limit being, &quot;hey Sony/Verant, if we<br/>
the following &lt;list&gt; keep seeing &lt;badguy&gt; in the game, we are<br/>
going to stop paying our $10/month. Him or us, decide.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Presenting a business with a clear $-vs-$ decision is often a<br/>
quick way to encourage direct action.<br/>
<br/>
Only problem is, if you do this, you have to be ready to actually<br/>
vacate the game, or the threat has no power.</div>
