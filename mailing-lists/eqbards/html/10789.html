I could send it pvt but all I need is the best stuff for a melee bard ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now for stuff within reason, lets assume less than dual Yaks for now.  What<br/>
can a bard dual wield that is better than Staff o&#39; Writhing and Dragoon<br/>
Dirk? (some of these combo&#39;s I don&#39;t know if they are even possible with<br/>
primary hand restrictions whatever)<br/>
<br/>
Staff & Silver axe?	  Better<br/>
Staff & Obscidean Shard?  Better only with Proc<br/>
Staff & Obscidean Scim?	  Not Better<br/>
Staff & Runed Falchion?   Better and Best<br/>
<br/>
What is the best?  Yes I have all my melee skills maxed.<br/>
<br/>
All the betters are ratio only, except shard which is actually worse ratio<br/>
but great Proc.<br/>
<br/>
Lower is better.<br/>
<br/>
Dragoon Dirk	3.83	the mark to measure against, bonuses work in ranged<br/>
slot<br/>
Silvery War Axe 	3.67	barely better and same weight<br/>
Obsidian shard	4.17	worse, but that +6 AGI is hard to argue with<br/>
Obsidian Scimitar	3.9	barely worse, but with a 30pt Proc<br/>
Runed falchion	3.09	far better<br/>
Sharkjaw Cutlass	3.2	definitely better and actually lighter at<br/>
dmg 10<br/>
Bladed Thulian 	3.8	surprisingly close given its 600pp price tag<br/>
Crystalline Sword	3.45	Fave on Innorukk apparently<br/>
Polished G Tommy	4.33	Worse, but ok Proc for comparison<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Writhing	3.67 for comparison<br/>
