&gt;Even with an Enchanter in the party, I&#39;ll often keep Pixie strike memmed,<br/>
&gt;just in case.  I can usually keep 3 targets mezzed (barring resists) quite<br/>
&gt;comfortably, but that effectively removes me from combat completely - I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t melee or twist other songs, since once I&#39;ve re-mezzed one target, I&#39;m<br/>

I keep them alive, they keep me alive. :-)<br/>

&gt;I had *the* closest escape in the Dreadlands the other night.  I was intent<br/>
&gt;on making 46 and decided to solo for a while since group exp in DL is<br/>
&gt;comparatively slow.  I was chain-charming things and my last thrall was a<br/>
&gt;SoW&#39;d Drachnid Widow which was at half health from it&#39;s last fight.  I<br/>
&gt;pulled it to the Karnors east wall and weaved my way through the pillars,<br/>
&gt;chanting, chaining and Selo&#39;s-ing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She got a few big double hits on me which made me wince, but I thought I<br/>
&gt;could handle it.  Then, horror of all horrors, she rooted me and moved in<br/>
&gt;for the kill.  At first I tried to charm her, but she kept stunning me.  All<br/>
&gt;of a sudden I&#39;m down to less than a bubble of health and the realisation<br/>
&gt;that my last couple of hours work was all for nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gave up on charm and started mashing Pixie Strike.  It landed.  I quickly<br/>
&gt;swapped my tambourine for lute and twisted in Hymn.  Another burst of Pixie<br/>
&gt;Strike and she remained mesmerised.  I kept this going for 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>
&gt;Pixie Strike until the roots fell from my feet and I thought &quot;screw this&quot;<br/>
&gt;and made for the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And here&#39;s a /rude to the 49 SK from Prophecy who stood by and watched the<br/>
&gt;whole time. :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I swear, when I zoned into FV, my hands were clammy and shaking.  It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;a game, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pixie Strike is one song I&#39;ll never do without - Enchanter or no.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;wait until 53 for Song of Twilight.<br/>

&quot;Nice job getting out of that one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I almost always like to have &quot;fear&quot; memorized as well when outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
I sure wish they&#39;d give us 10 active song slots. I hate tossing out that <br/>
one song that could potentially save the group.<br/>
