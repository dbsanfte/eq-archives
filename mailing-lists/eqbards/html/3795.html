&lt;&lt; I found out about this quest a few days ago and have been trying to<br/>
 complete it (since I have a lute in the bank). Unfortunately, while I know<br/>
 I won&#39;t have trouble finding Lord Grimrot &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well i found him in SK and was messing around with him , but the only thing i <br/>
can get out of him is this stuff about pestilence and his scythe and what <br/>
not. for kicks i tried all different kinds of phrases but got nothing. Is <br/>
this really the right guy to start the quest?</div>
