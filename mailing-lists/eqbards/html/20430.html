<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007582317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; No kidding. Newbie bard made level 12 last night in Kurn&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; Tower! Woot! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Err, Sunday night, right?  What time Sunday night?  I hit it <br/>
&gt; at 8:00ish EST.<br/>
&gt; Did I beat you too???  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, by &quot;last night&quot; I either meant &quot;last thursday&quot; or &quot;next week&quot;, I can&#39;t<br/>
remember which :o) In fact *puts on Arcane Cap of Linear Time Perception* it<br/>
was about, oh, 11pm EST, so you win! :o)<br/>
<br/>
I have decided I cannot stand monotonic ouvre of Kurns Tower much longer and<br/>
returned to FV (including amazing cliff dive and hair raising Corpse<br/>
Recovery)only to find it SNOWING. It was really pretty, though oddly there<br/>
was no accumulation :o) I took a peek at the Lake of Ill Omen and decided my<br/>
time is probaly now best spent elsewhere, so, off to Unrest! Thanks again<br/>
everyone for all the suggestions.<br/>
