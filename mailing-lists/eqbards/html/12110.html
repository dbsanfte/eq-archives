<div id="ygrps-yiv-111344049">If not so much Bard hate as Bard disdain.  This is a strike, in the balance <br/>
teams mind, against bards.  When they look at adding a new song that might <br/>
be a power up to the class or look at adjusting our skill cap on say dodge, <br/>
someone like Abashi will say, &quot;Well bards have unbalanced tracking so we <br/>
better not do that&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I do not see it so much as a slam against Verant as indicative of their <br/>
feeling that the classes are &#39;finished&#39;, despite player feedback to the <br/>
contrary. It took them 9 months for them figure out that Shaman Alchemy was <br/>
broke (even though Shamans have been petitioning this forever) and about the <br/>
same time to fix our level 22 song (using fix in the broadest term here, ie <br/>
it does something now).<br/>

&gt;How is this evidence of &quot;bard hate&quot; at all?  Gordon said two things:<br/>
&gt;1.  Druids won&#39;t be able to track better than Bards.<br/>
&gt;2.  Bard&#39;s tracking cap is too high, but won&#39;t be changed (i.e. No Nerf).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you think this is an example of &quot;bard hate&quot; then I&#39;d think you are too<br/>
&gt;paranoid and just looking for any chance to slam Verant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; More evidence that &quot;bard hate&quot; is alive and well - unfortunately it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game designers and not monsters:<br/>

&gt; &gt; [clipped off www.eqvault.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com">http://www.eqvault.com</a>&gt;  where Gordon<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Verant&#39;s internet P/R person) was answering questions about druid<br/>
&gt;tracking<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill being raised]<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well we definatly wouldn&#39;t want to increase the cap to a level above<br/>
&gt;bards,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as to do so would devalue the ranger. The bard cap, to be honest, is set<br/>
&gt;too<br/>
&gt; &gt; high, but we&#39;ll just live with that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please keep the comments coming.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am beginning to wonder if _anyone_ at Verant has played chars thru <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50 - start to finish like regular players do?  From what perspective are<br/>
&gt; &gt; they getting these _endless_ visions of &quot;class balancing&quot; needs.  And <br/>
&gt;ya,<br/>
&gt;ya<br/>
&gt; &gt; - I wonder if _any_ of them ever play a normal bard - I dare anyone of<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; to level a bard to 35.  Much less test that new or changed spell/song on<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bats in North Qeynos/G&#39;Fay/West Freep.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s. really looking forward to level 40 - woo hoo Picklocks!!! Already<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; my gnome fiend making me a set of Gnomish Lockpicks.  And when I get<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.... LOOKOUT Befallen HERE I COME!!!!  Woo hoo a level 40 skill in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 20 dungeon!!!  /auction BBC 10pp or best offer - gimme a tell if <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want a sword that lowers your stats!!<br/>
