<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-731406465">First let me appologize if you get 4 or more copies of this.  All the<br/>
mail servers are screwed up around here...<br/>
<br/>
k, this is completely off topic BUT I need your help.  My guild is<br/>
doing a joint guild event in South<br/>
Karana sometime in the near future (with 5 other guilds).  I, being a<br/>
fun loving party bard, have been<br/>
appointed to the &quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very<br/>
creative today and I&#39;m fresh out of<br/>
new and amusing ideas.  I want to<br/>
try to do something fun that isn&#39;t the same old same old.  I figure<br/>
the best place to go for some ideas<br/>
would be here!  The home of the fun loving, party enhancing,<br/>
entertaining bard.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you ideas in advance :)<br/>
