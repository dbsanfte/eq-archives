&gt; &gt; Just made 17th Wheeeeee!!!  (Any ideas on best weapons to Dual?  Since I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt; an extra one in the bank I&#39;m using 2 mino axes)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;ve just gotten dual wield, you want a fast weapon in<br/>
&gt; your off hand to increase the number of dual wield checks to<br/>
&gt; drive up the skill faster.  Definitely not a minotaur axe<br/>
&gt; (delay 37)?  At low dual wield skill level, it will activate<br/>
&gt; so infrequently that the damage it does is negligible, so<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t be afraid to buy a 21 delay dagger off a merchant for<br/>
&gt; 2pp (though if you find someone selling a fine steel dagger,<br/>
&gt; all the better since it is 19 delay).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you get it maxxed out, you want something with a good<br/>
&gt; damage/delay ratio, and perferably with a low delay.  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; also find that dual wield will often drain your stamina faster<br/>
&gt; than you lose hp.  Lighter weapons will reduce this effect,<br/>
&gt; which is more reason to prefer low delay weapons since they<br/>
&gt; tend to be lighter.  (I *think* weapon type affects this too,<br/>
&gt; as I&#39;ve noticed more stamina drop swinging a 5 lb staff than a<br/>
&gt; 5 lb sword.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re 17 and still using minotaur axes?  Beg/borrow/buy some<br/>
&gt; magic weapons - many of the mobs you should be fighting are<br/>
&gt; invulnerable to normal weapons, especially undead.  For<br/>
&gt; combine weapons (can be bought at various gypsy camps), my<br/>
&gt; preference is the rapier, spear, longsword, then scimitar<br/>
&gt; (scimitar is the cheapest).  If you have some friends around<br/>
&gt; L20, drop by Crushbone and kill Dvinn for his dirk - it is<br/>
&gt; perhaps the best weapon you can get in this level range.  I<br/>
&gt; make sure *all* my friends have a magic weapon by L15, even if<br/>
&gt; it means I have to loan one to them.  It is just not worth it<br/>
&gt; having half your heavy hitters standing on the sidelines<br/>
&gt; playing cheerleader if you get an ice bone skeleton, or fire<br/>
&gt; elemental, or any of the other multitude of mobs that require<br/>
&gt; magic weapons.<br/>
