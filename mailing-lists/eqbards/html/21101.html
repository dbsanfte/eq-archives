<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144985431">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
 I agree that Verant comes off with a superior attitude when it comes to<br/>
dealing with bugs and issues feedback from the customers. Maybe it is an<br/>
inescapeable consequence of success. I think they will live to regret this.<br/>
I say this based simply on having worse experience from UO. I was in UO<br/>
beta, and final UO for a year, (Atlantic, ugh!). They Totally disreguarded<br/>
all feedback from the player base. Their attitude was it is going to be our<br/>
way no matter what. Theory: overcrowded servers? Can&#39;t be, we&#39;ll just turn<br/>
down spawn rates and everyone will spread out more. Actual: players turned<br/>
to the best source of items in the game, other players. Did that change<br/>
Designer Dragon&#39;s vision? Not one bit. I will never pay that company money<br/>
again. It was on par with a bad marriage, you keep thinking things will get<br/>
better, things could be fun but it never happened. It wasn&#39;t til EQ beta<br/>
that we realized how tedious and petty UO had become. This isn&#39;t to say<br/>
Verant is great, simply better than UO. There is much room for improvement<br/>
and that won&#39;t happen til another serious competitor comes out, same as EQ<br/>
did for UO. Once Eq was out and UO lost alot of people, they started<br/>
emailing those of us who quit that they were making changes, etc. So I look<br/>
forward to the next new game, maybe I will play it, maybe not, but it will<br/>
have an impact on the other games out there. (It won&#39;t be UO2, having read<br/>
their FAQ and understanding what I do about DDspeak, there seems little<br/>
change in their PK stance.)<br/>
<br/>
Competition is a wonderful thing.<br/>

On a sidenote about heavy weapons, I am using a Sarnak Skullsplitter, better<br/>
damage than a YAK about the same weight, and a Martune Rapier. The splitter<br/>
is heavy and long fights give me some stam problems but I enjoy hitting for<br/>
the occasional 50 points or so. I was using a Runed Falchion/ Sharkjaw<br/>
Cutlass combo and I could swing all day with those 2. Those 2 are currently<br/>
on loan to Gediprime from Brilly&#39;s Weapons Vault. I do carry a YAK around<br/>
since it was a present from my cleric, but I prefer the splitter, also a<br/>
present from the cleric.<br/>
