<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328416865">I&#39;m sorry but for one thing it is not the only way to get to qeynos from<br/>
freeport. You can travel through the mountains. Second a little hardship<br/>
isn&#39;t going to kill you or any other newbies. If worst comes to worst just<br/>
travel through Rathe Mountains like all the evil melee class do. Newbies no<br/>
longer have to dodge griffins or hill giants because us high levels hunt<br/>
them constantly. Newbies have an easier economy to work with then we did.<br/>
Not only that but newbies also get the occasional teleport or sow. Teleport<br/>
was unheard of when we were newbies sow was as rare as teleport back then.<br/>
There are ways around it your just going to have to stick it through.<br/>

&gt;I see from the board that many of you are upset that the undead spawns in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Kithicor is, at one and the same time, a newbie zone AND a zone that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you MUST<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;travel through in order to get from the four eastern cities to RV, and that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you would<br/>

 </span></blockquote>route to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HK/Qeynos/Halas from RV takes you through Runnyeye and Beholder, hardly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>safe zones<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;below level 20 or so, and takes a LOT longer to HK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  The fact that these spawn only appeared at night is not a help.  In<br/>
 </span></blockquote>order to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;traverse the zone safely, this would require you to wait until dawn each<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wanted to get through the zone (unless you were sufficiently high level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that it didn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;matter, see point 3).  If you thought waiting for the boat was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>irritating...   This is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;NOT a good use of playing time.  Plus, although the spawn did not appear<br/>
 </span></blockquote>during the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;daytime, I am not convinced that they actually evaporated at dawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3.  I travelled through Kithicor the other night at the tail end of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>event.  Even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;with sixty people actively hunting, I blundered into 3 spawn points between<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WC and RV,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and 2 points between RV and HP.  Luckily, three of them had not yet<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;dropped&quot; from the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sky, and the other two I was able to put on the brakes for (barely), but I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>note the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;following:  1)  two of these points were so close to the zone wall that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>even the &quot;edge<br/>

&gt;I would love to see a high level outdoor zone, myself, but it should not<br/>

&gt;&gt; I think that it does have something to do with it.  I read plenty of<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;               On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; talked to a gm<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>
