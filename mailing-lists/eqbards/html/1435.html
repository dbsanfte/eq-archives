<div id="ygrps-yiv-761690643">I think most of you know this, but keep in mind that there are a lot of<br/>
situations in which where you stand when you are camping seens to directly<br/>
affect the spawn rates of the creatures you are camping for.  I have seen<br/>
that if you stand to close to a spawn spot a monster often does not seem to<br/>
spawn for a long time.  Also, I have a paladin friend who has been camping a<br/>
popular SK in befallen and when he leaves the room it spawns every few<br/>
mintutes, but if someone is standing in the room it spawns in it takes<br/>
significantly longer to reappear.<br/>

&gt; Though is has nothing to do with the macro setup, I&#39;ll discuss the<br/>
&gt; friendly gnoll Grenix. He does anything but spawn regularly. He know<br/>
&gt; longer follows the 6 hour schedule, and at times he won&#39;t spawn for 12<br/>
&gt; or so hours, and then 3 times the next hour. I&#39;ve sat around, <br/>
&gt; watch many<br/>
&gt; fights(lost too many of them to nukers and high level <br/>
&gt; people), and I can<br/>
&gt; safely say there is no pattern. Even the captain formula(don&#39;t ask)<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t work anymore. Getting one of these is pure luck. And <br/>
&gt; yes, it is<br/>
&gt; strange they spawn there. Too bad the captain is blind heh...<br/>
