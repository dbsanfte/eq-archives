<div id="ygrps-yiv-741736815">If Verant hands my friend a gas-powered chainsaw, gives me a rusty file, and tells us to go chop down some<br/>
trees, I am quite willing to concede that the file isn&#39;t useless, and I am more than smart enough to<br/>
figure out how to do things with it.  I am even willing to admit that, when I succeed in chopping a tree<br/>
down that way, I&#39;ll be pretty darn proud of myself.  That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s balanced.<br/>

&gt; yeah i couldn&#39;t figure out how it got there either.  but i was bored at work yesterday,<br/>
&gt; and my pet peeve is when people can&#39;t figure out uses for things or ways to do things<br/>
&gt; then blame verant for making a useless song/spell/item/game/etc. </span></blockquote></div>
