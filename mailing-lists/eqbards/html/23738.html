<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949298758">I had a similar experience in Cazic that made me glad to be a Bard as well.<br/>
<br/>
We were in the Archon Area (Temple Floor). We had no Cleric or Enchanter. The<br/>
most pulls we had the entire time was 4 mobs. There was Myself (Bard 34), Necro<br/>
30, Paly 30, Shaman 31, Rogue 36, Mage 31.  The Necro would Mez when mana<br/>
permitted and I would Charm/Mez as needed. It worked out well. The 2 Pets and 2<br/>
Tanks chewed through Mobs. I kept most of the casters at 60% mana or better and<br/>
we pulled almost constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Necro had to leave so we got a Monk. First question was do have an Enchanter<br/>
(keep in mind the day before he wouldn&#39;t join our group in TR since we didn&#39;t<br/>
have a Cleric and Enchanter. Only a Druid and a Bard)? I proclaimed &quot;No you have<br/>
something better in a Bard.&quot;  He was a little hesistant and stayed. He later<br/>
admitted he was &quot;raised&quot; to think Enchanters and Clerics were always needed. But<br/>
I definitely proved that theory wrong for the next 1.5 hours as I was able to<br/>
handle 2-3 mobs through Charm/Mez. Went through a String of resists for about 30<br/>
seconds and had 3 mobs beating on me and only lost a bubble of health while<br/>
getting 2 of the 3 under control and the group took the 3rd.<br/>
<br/>
Was my first night using Pixie as a true Crowd control since the patch made<br/>
changes months ago. I was impressed. I was able to weave it in to my rotation<br/>
and keep 2 mobs mezzed while singing Anthen or the level 34 Cantana (Great song<br/>
imo).<br/>
<br/>
All in all a great night and I was able to educate at least 1 Monk on the<br/>
abilities of a bard. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Atonal it only gets better after 28 so keep at it. I noticed a world of<br/>
difference at 32 with Manasong then 34 with the New Cantana.  At 32-34 I was<br/>
invited in to many group in Lower Guk I had business being near. But survived.<br/>
:-) Hit 35 and got Tracking. Time for some Rare hunting in FM and HG&#39;s in Rathe<br/>
Mtns.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last night, I was in the best group ever.  Within the space of 5 hours, I<br/>
went from 1 bubble away from 26, to one bubble inside 28!<br/>
<br/>
The group consisted of:<br/>
Bard (me)<br/>
Monk<br/>
Warrior/Paladin<br/>
Ranger<br/>
Rogue<br/>
Mage<br/>
<br/>
We handled pulls of 3, and even 4 (once I got the hang of charming..heh).<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is a tank/melee heavy group like the one described above<br/>
better than a caster heavy group, or even a melee/caster balanced group?<br/>
Never before had I been in a group that handled so many mobs, within that<br/>
amount of time, and only once did any group member ever drop below two<br/>
bubbles of health.  She did a FD, and at half, got up, and helped us finish<br/>
off the *group* of mobs we had at the time.  Oh, wait, the rogue got beat up<br/>
once...but didn&#39;t die...hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Was it the group, or does the charm song make that much of a difference?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed...I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what was suddenly so<br/>
right about being a bard in a group...and getting that much xp.  Hehe...<br/>
<br/>
Atonal the rambler...  :)<br/>
