I feel as if I am walking in your footsteps a bit: I just achieved 35th 2 nights<br/>
ago; I just received my Mistmoore Drum last night, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of footsteps, I now have Journeyman&#39;s Boots and Selo&#39;s will not override<br/>
the J-boot spell.  Despite that I absolutely love them.  One of the main benefits: <br/>
speed whilst invisible.  A small point to share: you must turn off your songs to<br/>
activate the spell.  No need to wait through all the pulses though such as you must<br/>
do for sneak/hide just wait until the song ends message.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW I use hide in Cazic Thule frequently for those few moments to fetch a drink<br/>
from the kitchen.  Best use for it that I have found.)<br/>
<br/>
12 hours to get the boots and worth it all.<br/>
