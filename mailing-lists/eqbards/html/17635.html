 </span></blockquote>It lasts the same amount of time, which really IMHO is long<br/>
enough.  Once you get a little practice with it, it&#39;s pretty<br/>
easy to recharm almost as soon as the previous charm drops.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to expire early a bit more than the old charm, but<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because the mobs are higher level, or<br/>
because I&#39;ve lost 10 points of charisma during all this time<br/>
Pixie Strike has been broken.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how effective it&#39;d be in the planes.  I can think of<br/>
a couple trains we could&#39;ve derailed with a single charm.<br/>
