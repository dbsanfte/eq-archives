<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490065645">Mistmoore is a great zone and you will quickly advance from level 21 upto<br/>
27ish. Best places to fight in a group is either the the left of the lake<br/>
on the slope (looking at it from the zone), along the wall behind the lake<br/>
or to the right of the tower ( not highly recommended as people run across<br/>
here as a shortcut when running from a train).<br/>
<br/>
There are 10 spawns around this entrance area and 2 gargoyles also spawn on<br/>
the side of the tower. The spawns are very fast and if you are the only<br/>
group then you will probably not need to pull from the chasm area as they<br/>
will respawn by the time you have killed them all. If you find you have<br/>
time there are another 8-10 spawns along the chasm that are no harder than<br/>
the lake spawns.<br/>
<br/>
Because mistmoore is so underpopulated you may not need to avoid trains,<br/>
however if there is a castle group and they cause a train then keep invis<br/>
memmed and just invis the entire group, none of the mobs from the castle<br/>
can see invis (from previous experiences inside the castle) so you should<br/>
be safe and just let the train go back before pulling again.<br/>
<br/>
Always be wary of the caster mobs inside Mistmoore they do lots of dmg,<br/>
especially avoid the negotiator, I had a bad experience at level 26 with<br/>
this mob, it charmed me and walked me all the way into the castle and when<br/>
charm wore off I was in the middle of Mistmoore castle alone. Managed to<br/>
find another group who showed me the way out and I actually survived<br/>
(before being charmed I had 1% health, on my way back to the castle I was<br/>
completly healed by a mob, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Goodluck, mistmoore is an excellent zone you just need to be careful. The<br/>
exp is amazing and you can level very quickly.<br/>

Hi, just visited MM for the first time on late Saturday night (prolly<br/>
the worst time, few ppl there, so I saw and died to several trains).  My<br/>
question is where can my group and I hunt there (I&#39;m 21, the group<br/>
ranges to 26) fairly safely?  (The idea is to be in the zone for a while<br/>
and /auction WTB MM drum.  Anyone have a clue what those would go for?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Really encouraging for a  first time visit (my group decided that<br/>
Unrest is safer then Cazic)<br/>
