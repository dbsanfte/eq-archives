&gt; Ok, I kind of see where you&#39;re going with this.  And it would be neat to<br/>
&gt; have bard buffs that dramatically increase stats for a shor period of time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good point :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The problem with that Wendy, is that Shaman&#39;s are suppose to be<br/>
  the best buffers in the game.  I don&#39;t want to strip them of that<br/>
  title.  That&#39;s my issue I&#39;m torn between.  I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>
  exceed their values, but I think the fact our duration is so, so<br/>
  low that we need some compensation.  Alternatively, one click =<br/>
  6 buffs basically.  So Verant may be counting the easy of use, and<br/>
  the multiplicity factor in there as well.  But still, 6 secs...<br/>
  ugh ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  I really don&#39;t know what the solution is.  I just want us to <br/>
  represent everything a balanced party would be looking for with<br/>
  some unique skills.  I don&#39;t know that super buffs would do it.<br/>
