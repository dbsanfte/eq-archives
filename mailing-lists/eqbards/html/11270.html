<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422781783">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions this morning for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Which room in Mistmoore is the home of the gypsy lute dropping gypsies?  How do I get there?  Is there a secret way (i.e. through the secret room in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group of around 30&#39;s? (I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My train hotkey shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)  Once I get to said room, how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>
<br/>
2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my time on the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?  About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>
<br/>
And in another non-related vein:<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone please post or supply the web address to a comprehensive list of Bard skill caps?  And once more, where do you have to go to train that first point in Instill Doubt?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time for all the help,<br/>
<br/>
