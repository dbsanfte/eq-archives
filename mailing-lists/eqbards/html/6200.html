message from the client saying &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still singing&quot; in<br/>
time for the next *pulse*, it thinks you&#39;ve stopped singing,<br/>
and when the client finally does get a &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still<br/>
singing&quot; packet through, the server considers that to be you<br/>
*starting* a song, and starting a song will make you visible.<br/>
If you ever watch someone suffering from packet loss, they<br/>
will often blink in and out of view (prelude to going<br/>
linkdead) and sometimes show up as linkdead.  Your songs stop<br/>
when you&#39;re linkdead, so if you&#39;re blinking due to PL, the<br/>
server probably thinks you&#39;ve stopped your song even if it&#39;s<br/>
only for a fraction of a second.<br/>
