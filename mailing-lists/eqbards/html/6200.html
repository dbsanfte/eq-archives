&gt; I&#39;m speculating that the client is trying to get a packet through that<br/>
&gt; says &quot;Hey!  I&#39;m still singing Shauri&#39;s.&quot;  However, if this packet<br/>
&gt; keeps disappearing into the ether, then the song interval times out on<br/>
&gt; the server, and the server figures I&#39;ve stopped singing, so I become<br/>
&gt; visible.  Eventually, the client manages to get the packet through,<br/>

message from the client saying &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still singing&quot; in<br/>
time for the next *pulse*, it thinks you&#39;ve stopped singing,<br/>
and when the client finally does get a &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still<br/>
singing&quot; packet through, the server considers that to be you<br/>
*starting* a song, and starting a song will make you visible.<br/>
If you ever watch someone suffering from packet loss, they<br/>
will often blink in and out of view (prelude to going<br/>
linkdead) and sometimes show up as linkdead.  Your songs stop<br/>
when you&#39;re linkdead, so if you&#39;re blinking due to PL, the<br/>
server probably thinks you&#39;ve stopped your song even if it&#39;s<br/>
only for a fraction of a second.<br/>
