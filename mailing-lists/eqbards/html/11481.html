<div id="ygrps-yiv-907953643">Oh, this is just too funny.  A bard that actually knows their class - and<br/>
we are OVERPOWERED? hahaha<br/>
<br/>
This translates to - &quot;I want MY class to kick every other classes butt -<br/>
therefore - they must be overpowered&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like Mr. Ranger here relies on a few techniques, mainly his bow -<br/>
and doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s fair he might have to rethink his stragtegy and<br/>
tactics.<br/>

&gt;&gt;     Last night I dueled a 22nd level bard friend in the Arena at Lake<br/>
&gt;Rathe,<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was hoping I could really plink her with arrows and try to snare her<br/>
&gt;wich<br/>
&gt;&gt; did work. BUT she soon found my range of my weapons and my minimum range<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; the bow (meaning she was too close for me to fire). and she was always out<br/>
&gt;&gt; of range or too close for me to fire the bow. Now that said She on the<br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;&gt; hand could run me down even snared if she was singing the celos<br/>
&gt;&gt; acceleration. HOW is it even possible for a melee type to beat a Bard they<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have to face you to hit you,cus they have an AOE with a huge range<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;&gt; it, they can hit you with a DD well out of the range of the bow you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; root them cus the sow song breaks it. if they stand toe to toe with you<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt; ghet stomped pretty bad but all they have to do is back off a bit and run<br/>
&gt;&gt; from you for a sec or two to regen. In my opinion the bards are the most<br/>
&gt;&gt; unbalanced class in the game.  I can easily take down a wizzy or necro<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;&gt; out much problem if I can ever get a root off on em a warror is a joke<br/>
&gt;once<br/>
&gt;&gt; you hit em with snare and have plenty of arrows,  I have not tried to<br/>
&gt;fight<br/>
&gt;&gt; a druid or shamen yet but, at least I feel it is possible for me to beat<br/>
&gt;em.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am not so sure about a bard. anyone got any advise.<br/>
