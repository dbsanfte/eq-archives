<div id="ygrps-yiv-404239593">I helped my barbarian warrior pal do it.  We met a hummie warrior who had<br/>
done it like 3 times that day - he wanted the 2hs version you get as the<br/>
rare drop.  It&#39;s damn fun quest - old Frosty sure knows how to train you to<br/>
the crazyiest places - can you can Bandits & Brigand, Scarecrow Fields,<br/>
Cyclops camps?  My bard fiend did all the talking and went thru the initial<br/>
dialogs to start the quest - then handed in the stuffs and got the slasher<br/>
no problem.  Of cousre his faction was prolly perfect.  I hear you can build<br/>
faction by giving lotsa gnoll fang to someone in Halas (a woman near the<br/>
pier?)<br/>
<br/>
Or get a barb to do the final dialog (opps he has to loot the head as it&#39;s<br/>
the no drop - well you could run it 2 times and he gets a sword (not even<br/>
lore - so you can dual wield if u think its got good stats))<br/>

<br/>
		Has anyone here done the Langseax quest?  Last night, I did<br/>
this quest, to<br/>
		obtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.<br/>
For those of<br/>
		you who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of<br/>
quest, and though<br/>
		not particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
		I did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item<br/>
(the murderer&#39;s<br/>
		head), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then<br/>
regarded me<br/>
		amiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said,<br/>
&quot;Although the wolves of<br/>
		the north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD<br/>
FOR YOU!&quot;   (Okay,<br/>
		that wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).<br/>
<br/>
		Is it a warrior only quest or something?  It didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
be.  Anyone else<br/>
		had any experience with it?<br/>
