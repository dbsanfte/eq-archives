<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074949805">On the other hand, here&#39;s how I saw it:<br/>
<br/>
I logged in and immediately tested clouding.  After finding out it didn&#39;t<br/>
work, I wrote it off to another snafu and still am happy they decided to put<br/>
the change in.  This doesn&#39;t mean we WON&#39;T get it.  It just means it&#39;ll be<br/>
next patch or the one after.  Big deal.  After a year of playing this game,<br/>
an improvement like this isn&#39;t going to kill me coming in a week or 2 late.<br/>
I don&#39;t plan on quitting the game any time soon, so in 4 months from now I<br/>
won&#39;t even remember &quot;that week or 2 I &#39;should&#39; have had the see invis<br/>
component and didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t imagine being in a job where EVERY thing I did was questioned,<br/>
analyzed, reanalyzed, condemned and 2nd guessed at least 140,000 times.<br/>
Where you do something you see as positive and a section of people will<br/>
always think it sucks.  How many changes went into the patch?  1 or 2 things<br/>
they missed for whatever reason doesn&#39;t account for much.  Especially when<br/>
they WILL be fixed sooner rather than later.  Shit does happen and I&#39;m glad<br/>
someone (or 170,000 someone&#39;s) isn&#39;t there nitpicking at every move I make.<br/>
<br/>
To compare an ever-evolving game with this large of a player base to a<br/>
single player game isn&#39;t fair.  And I can think of numerous &quot;professionally<br/>
released&quot; pieces of software that are released buggy.  Oftentimes with a<br/>
patch that does a worse job of explaining any fix if a fix even comes.  I&#39;ll<br/>
name Windows 98 as a prime example.  I feel Verant is doing as good a job<br/>
with what they&#39;re working with as ANY group could.  With them, at least we<br/>
know they ARE trying.  They may f*ckup, but they will keep trying.  And one<br/>
day another game will come out that we&#39;ll all love to play more.  But, they<br/>
obviously are doing something right, right now, or we all wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
playing or be so passionate about it.<br/>
