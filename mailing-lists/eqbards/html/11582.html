<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127932132">Hey...  That&#39;s a good idea.  I&#39;ll try and test this tonight since I&#39;m in CT.<br/>
However, I know there have been times when I was Clouded and something<br/>
popped in next to me and didn&#39;t see me.  One example I can offer is in the<br/>
little alcove in Mistmoore.  A few times there have been trains in Mistmoore<br/>
(say it ain&#39;t so!) that I threw invis up for.  While we were waiting on the<br/>
backwash mobs popped in around us without attacking.  But it&#39;s still a good<br/>
theory worth investigating.<br/>

&gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>
&gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>
&gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>
&gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>
&gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>
&gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>
&gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>
&gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>
&gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>
&gt; it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>
&gt; this, please do so.<br/>
