&gt; There&#39;s also something to be said for weight here. A shield weighs roughly<br/>
&gt; 10 lbs for the small races, +2.5(dirk)-10(screaming mace) lbs for your<br/>
&gt; weapon. Presently I dual wield a combine long (7.5) and a dirk (2.5) for a<br/>

longsword is 8.5 lbs.  There are some nice shields that are<br/>
lightweight.  The scarab shield for example is only 4.5 lbs<br/>
and has 15 AC.  The Darkwood shield gives a strength bonus<br/>
which pretty much negates its weight.<br/>

I personally cary one purse (negligible weight as far as I can<br/>
tell) for my food and bandages, another purse for instruments<br/>
and small loot (runes, words, etc), and a backpack or<br/>
large/small bag.  One of the weight-reducing packs is high on<br/>
my priority list...<br/>
<br/>
Coins weigh 1 lb per 40.  So if you&#39;ve got 200 cp, you&#39;re<br/>
basically lugging around 5 pounds for 2 gp.  I destroy rusty<br/>
weapons which have a similar price/weight ratio, so I either<br/>
drop the copper or give it to a low level mob to make some<br/>
newbie happy.  :-)<br/>

Given my recent Selo&#39;s/SoW timings, it is almost as fast for a<br/>
L20 bard to run to town, sell, and run back, as it is for a<br/>
spellcaster to gate to town, sell, and run back.  Since my<br/>
charisma is high and I get the best prices, I&#39;ve taken to<br/>
collecting everyone&#39;s loot to sell, running to town (playing<br/>
Selo&#39;s and two strength buffs), selling, dropping by the bank<br/>
to convert to platinum, and running back to my party to<br/>
distribute the platinum.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to a knowledgable monk some time.  They know lots of<br/>
tricks to keep their weight down (I learned how terrible<br/>
backpacks were from a monk).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, odd thing about bards and Unrest and bronze armor.  Both<br/>
my cleric friends are selling all the bronze they&#39;re finding<br/>
instead of wearing it.  They say that with me around, they<br/>
almost never get attacked, and thus feel they don&#39;t need the<br/>
extra AC given the weight penalty.<br/>
