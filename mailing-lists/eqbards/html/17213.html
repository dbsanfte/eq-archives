<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-751078117">I was killing HG last night with a group that contained another bard and the <br/>
other bard told me that using a horn doesn&#39;t increase the effectiveness of <br/>
Screech.  Is this correct?  Does the song just check your brass skill but <br/>
actually using a horn doesn&#39;t do anything?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that if a song has a  specific skill listed that using the <br/>
associated instrument would increase its affect.<br/>
