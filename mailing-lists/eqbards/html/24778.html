A quick comment on the Power lvl&#39;d remark.  You only remember the bad <br/>
ones because the good ones don&#39;t say a thing about it.  You could say <br/>
my warrior is power lvl&#39;d.  Or you could say he grouped exclusively <br/>
with my enchanter from 1 to 45. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realized after I hit send and reread what I wrote that I was a <br/>
little hard on pled characters, hehe.  The &quot;don&#39;t know what they&#39;re <br/>
doing&quot; part is probably more important and can be found plenty in non-<br/>
pled, non-twinked people as well.  I&#39;ve just had some bad experiences <br/>
with characters who&#39;s skills were sorely underdeveloped for their <br/>
level which put the group at risk.  I&#39;ve probably grouped with many <br/>
twinks/pled characters and didn&#39;t even know it. :)  What I was more <br/>
reacting to (from my own thoughts), was the idea that people throw <br/>
out &quot;I made 50 in 4 days!&quot; like it&#39;s some kind of badge of honor.  <br/>
There&#39;s exceptions to everything, but on face value, I would trust a <br/>
Level 50 Warrior with 50 days played MUCH more than a Level 50 <br/>
Warrior with 10.  And that&#39;s on an EASY class to learn. :)  <br/>
Obviously, someone taking the time to research and learn a class can <br/>
make up for the lack of experience, tho. :)<br/>

No worries, Bril, it was chaos at the zone in anyway... I couldn&#39;t <br/>
figure out why we were fighting all the roamers and golems when there <br/>
was another group there (not yours) working for exp, eheh.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that particular CR... Anyone know if they changed the way <br/>
CoH works?  I know it&#39;s not 100%, but it hasn&#39;t cleared aggro twice <br/>
in the recent past.  This time it was a resisted lull in Drusella&#39;s <br/>
room, which normaly means I&#39;m gonna eat it, but we decided to try to <br/>
CoH, which was superbly timed, but every last one of them rushed the <br/>
group.  I had even managed to mez one of the golems so we could <br/>
easily pull a single out of the pile. :/<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, nothing shows you the character of the group you&#39;re in until <br/>
you see how they react to a CR situation... and a pretty nasty one at <br/>
that, hehe.  The RNG (on lull) worked in our favor the next time <br/>
around and we got singles or duo&#39;s out of the room and Drusella <br/>
dropped the not-so-crappy-but-not-an-NOS Rod of Oblations again. :/<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on 57!  Enjoy Rondo and getting your Atk rating above 1000 <br/>
or 1100 or even 1200! :)<br/>

Just another opinionated people on Xegony :)</div>
