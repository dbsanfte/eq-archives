Consonant Chain.  Sure, I move waaay slow, but waaay slow is better than not<br/>
moving at all.  Has saved my fanny more than a few times in lower Guk.<br/>

&gt;Actually I think Selos root breaking effect does work in dungeons. I have<br/>
&gt;ben camping out in Befallen&#39;s basement alot lately with my guildmates,<br/>
&gt;mostly big Barb warriors who covet the BBC&#39;s and we get rooted all the<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt;I have tried it each time and it seems to unstick you or your group members<br/>
&gt;before you get that pesky&#39;you can&#39;t do that in here&#39; message. It is hard to<br/>
&gt;tell in the heat of a battle but now they will say ROOTED and when I hit<br/>
&gt;selos we can move again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to jig and being a mini-mana bard, we found this in beta and I am the<br/>
&gt;darling of the casters my level for it once they figure it out.<br/>
&gt;For hotbuttons, definitely add assist. You need to get used to the whole<br/>
&gt;group concentrating on one mob at a time and assist is the best way.<br/>
&gt;Essential for higherlevel dungeon hunting IMHO. I quit trying sense heading<br/>
&gt;since it always let me down when I had to know what direction NOW. For 3 pp<br/>
&gt;you can buy a compass and put it in your inventory hotkey. It never fails.<br/>
&gt;;)<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s hoping my bard has been restored on Xegony.<br/>
&gt;Brilinnia, currently ghost bard<br/>
