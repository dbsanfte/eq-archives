<div id="ygrps-yiv-373777852">If the mage and the bard were balanced to begin with I&#39;d agree.  They&#39;re<br/>
not.  Even if they were the same level they wouldn&#39;t be.  Without help you<br/>
can expect the bard to do about as well as France vs Geramny in 1940.<br/>
Should we have ignored their pleas as well?  Not to trivialize such things,<br/>
but I don&#39;t see how high-minded issues of balance of power can be used in<br/>
this situation to make the idea of assisting her seem ridiculous.<br/>

&gt; That would be Kae and Companies&#39; domain then, I am on E&#39;ci unfortunately.<br/>
&gt; It would help surprise that mage quite a bit though.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my domain is making do with what you have<br/>
available to you, not twinking up on high level equipment to<br/>
make things easier.<br/>
<br/>
To borrow a theme from Star Trek, I could lend Melodii some<br/>
platinum FO rings (5AC +55hp), but then I&#39;d feel obliged to<br/>
help the mage out with similar high-level equipment.<br/>
<br/>
This is supposed to be a fun event, not some bloodthirsty<br/>
winner-takes-all tournament.  Go there, do your best with what<br/>
you have, and have fun.  If you lose, no big deal.  If you<br/>
win, you&#39;ll be happier knowing you did it through sheer<br/>
ingenuity and not because you got twinked.<br/>
