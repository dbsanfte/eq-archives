<div id="ygrps-yiv-197717923">Hmm, I was buffed and in charisma gear for charming so my charisma was about<br/>
190 or so.  Bet that would help the Lament resist rates :).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I only got one resist on my charm the entire break in... Not bad :)<br/>

&gt; The last efreeti raid I went on was at 48th lvl.  At that time I decided<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; test lament to see how well it would stick.  So I memed it and tossed it<br/>
&gt; into my battle weave.  at 48 with an unbuffed cha of about 115 I was<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; resisted about 40% of the time.  I am itching to try it now on a single<br/>
&gt; party break in to Efreeti :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd<br/>
&gt; &gt; control.  Whenever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second,<br/>
&gt; &gt; command it to /pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ways away, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>
&gt; &gt; Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; too far and<br/>
&gt; &gt; agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; finished off an imp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining<br/>
&gt; &gt; Imps fell leaving<br/>
&gt; &gt; me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; elementals and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra incoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would then tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This had the<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter until<br/>
&gt; &gt; he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; hand in battle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with<br/>
&gt; &gt; great success.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and<br/>
&gt; &gt; used a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; less mana.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; the end I went<br/>
&gt; &gt; with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the<br/>
&gt; &gt; traditional<br/>
&gt; &gt; break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried Lament on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti<br/>
&gt; &gt; raid?  If Lament<br/>
&gt; &gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party<br/>
&gt; &gt; of 6 might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried it, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut<br/>
&gt; &gt; out with only<br/>
&gt; &gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>
