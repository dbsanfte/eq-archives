are attacking, unrelated to your party, will come over and<br/>
start whacking on you.  Sometimes even when you&#39;re not<br/>
singing.<br/>

Surely it can&#39;t be intended that the gnoll soothsayer the<br/>
other group is fighting turns around every 5 seconds to cast a<br/>
spell on me even though they are beating the crap out of it<br/>
and the only thing I&#39;m doing is watching and singing<br/>
Accelerando on myself.<br/>
