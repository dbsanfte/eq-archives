&gt;Okay folks, some of you have been a bit remiss in your bumping <br/>
&gt;duties.  Sure the new thread is on page 6 (making a total of 14 pages thus <br/>
&gt;far).  Yes, the thread had to be split by players.  But does that mean we <br/>
&gt;give up?  Not me ;o)~<br/>
&gt;Feel free to stop by and bump it to the moon and back if necessary  (oh <br/>
&gt;yeah, some lugnut posted a cursing flame that was pulled by the admin, so <br/>
&gt;at least THEY know of the thread :oP  )<br/>

nothing.  Countless posts of his have been ignored, too.<br/>
