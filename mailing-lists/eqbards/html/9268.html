<div id="ygrps-yiv-174331404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think proc is the incorrect term.  Although this is all pure rumor I<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;what is meant is that the weapon allows the user to click it and gate...not<br/>
&gt;that the weapon would randomly fire gate when being used.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;How does a weapon that procs gate make any sense at all?<br/>

into a rumor.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;...was browsing around the Druid&#39;s Grove and I found this link to a SS of<br/>
an NPC in the upcoming Plane of Hate.<br/>
<br/>
I betcha he drops the holy-grail of bard weapons, the quill that procs<br/>
gate!!<br/>
