<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743368455">Shhhh, I have known about this for some time...it has been used on occasion<br/>
when necessary for such useful things like grouping 30 people for one single<br/>
massive TP and the like.  I have grouped with 6 people and here are the<br/>
results:<br/>
<br/>
1. The 7th (and beyond) groupmember is not seen on the group health list to<br/>
the upper right of the screen.  This makes it tough to pay attention to the<br/>
additional groupmembers health if they get in trouble and need heals.<br/>
2. The 7th (and beyond) groupmember cannot see the rest of the party&#39;s<br/>
groupsay, but the rest of the group can see that persons groupsay text.<br/>
Additional group members above 6 tend to feel a bit isolated because of this<br/>
and the rest of the group must use standard &quot;/say&quot; to communicate with them.<br/>
3. All groupmembers will get shared XP for kills, it is just spread thinner<br/>
based on the number of additional members.<br/>
<br/>
It can be useful in a pinch but mostly its a pain in the arse.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] More than 6 in a group?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just read the following on AllaKhazam&#39;s page...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is possible to have a group larger than 6 people that still shares<br/>
experience for a kill.  To do this start with a group of 5.  Then have<br/>
someone outside the group invite the other non party members to form their<br/>
own group.  They should hold off on accepting the invite (don&#39;t decline<br/>
either).  Then invite the person who just did that invite to join the first<br/>
group.  After he accepts, and is added to the group, the other people he<br/>
invited should accept his group invitation.  They will now be part of the<br/>
overall group, but will not appear on the main group&#39;s member list.  They<br/>
will share xp for the kills and can make (but not hear) group tells.  When a<br/>
party member above them leaves, they will move up onto the list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If this actually works, it would be entirely possible to have multiple<br/>
groups combining into one to participate in Vox and Nagafen raids and get<br/>
group experience.<br/>
<br/>
And to keep it on topic, how does one Bard buffing 20 people and providing<br/>
Clarity to a dozen mana-drained casters sound? :)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how long it&#39;ll take to be &#39;fixed&#39;.<br/>
