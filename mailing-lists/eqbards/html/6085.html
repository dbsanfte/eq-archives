<div id="ygrps-yiv-28721105">The other night a crazy Barbarian friend of mine suggests we try working on<br/>
our hand-to-hand skills against the reavers.  Sure, I say, let me learn<br/>
a few appropriate songs (Chords, etc) and I&#39;ll equip the Lute.<br/>
<br/>
We do pretty well at reavers, but I notice my hand-to-hand skill never moves.<br/>
Eventually we get into a bad situation (or more correctly, a bad situation<br/>
is delivered to us by another player) and I switch over to Longsword and Dirk.<br/>
Immediatly I start getting skill-ups in Offense, Dual Wield, etc (I had just<br/>
recently made 19th and spent the session before making the cross-country run<br/>
to get Clouding).<br/>
<br/>
So it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>
hand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>
tell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>
<br/>
After realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that the<br/>
Lute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>
fight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>
take down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my hand-<br/>
to-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>
battle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>
with just songs...<br/>
