<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325952466">I found that it was rather ineffective (totally useless) at 15th <br/>
     level. (thus dangerous since it attracts a lot of attention.)  Only <br/>
     now at 20th level am I finding it useful.  It is great at crowd <br/>
     control when you have a large pull of which several are blue/green.  <br/>
     If (a big if) every one concentrates on the most dangerous mob (also <br/>
     the one most likely to resist) you have a good chance of lulling the <br/>
     blue green mobs.  They will still break out and hit you every once and <br/>
     a while but it works fairly well.  You do need to continually recast <br/>
     it over and over.  I don&#39;t try to weave at all when I am doing this.  <br/>
     So, I would advise not using it till you are higher level.  You might <br/>
     try it at around 18th since I had given up on it and didn&#39;t even try <br/>
     using it again till 20th.<br/>

Hi All,<br/>
     <br/>
This is my first posting to the list and I was hoping by coming out of lurk <br/>
mode I might get some help from some of the elder bards here. I recently <br/>
attained my 15th level and ran to the bards guild in Kelethin to get <br/>
Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye.  I went to www.harpers.net and took a look at the <br/>
writeup for this song. I am not sure of the proper usage for this song. How <br/>
should I use it say if I were approaching a dervish camp (like the one in <br/>
Oasis) with my group as opposed to using it in Unrest?  I did approach a few <br/>
bards who were over level 17 asking how exactly they used the song and I was <br/>
told on 2 occasions that they had gotten into more trouble than it was worth <br/>
with this song and not to use it.  After lurking on this list for the last <br/>
couple of weeks it seems that there are plenty of you out there who know how <br/>
to make this song work to your advantage and I&#39;d like to know how I should <br/>
approach this song.<br/>
     <br/>
Thank you in advance for any help you can give me. I am very very happy <br/>
playing my bard and can&#39;t see myself playing any other character. But then <br/>
again, maybe I&#39;m just a wood elf in human&#39;s clothing =)<br/>
