&gt; played them for 2+<br/>

&gt; us can key mash with the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, because too many of the gamers don&#39;t have enough sense to do things more<br/>
complicated than what occurred to them at random when they started. My wife<br/>
has been playing for a year longer than I have, and yet /she/ still uses the<br/>
newbie screen, only uses the few most basic social macros that everyone was<br/>
telling newbies to write way back when she started, et cetera. I suspect that<br/>
she&#39;s learned as much about the game because of my play than she&#39;d learned<br/>
the entire year before that. Hell, she doesn&#39;t even link skills to movement<br/>
keys...I link sense heading to left/right, loc to forward, and other skills<br/>
(forage, mend, et cetera) to center or forward as necessary, for example, and<br/>
she not only still won&#39;t, but didn&#39;t even know /how/ to link buttons until I<br/>
showed her.<br/>
