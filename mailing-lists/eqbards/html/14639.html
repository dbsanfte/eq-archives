<b>Subject:</b> Does CHR affect Largos? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742607603">I was in the assasin room in LGUK last night.  The ghoul knights we were<br/>
fighting usually either conned blue to me or red.  We had a druid in the<br/>
group ensnaring so I weaved Largos Binding during combat.  My CHR was 130 at<br/>
the time and whenever we went up against a red ghoul, they resisted Largos<br/>
frequently.  Later on an enchanter joined the group and buffed my CHR to<br/>
158.  From that point I was able to get Largos to stick on almost every red<br/>
ghoul we fought.  I didn&#39;t parse a log file so its all subjective, but it<br/>
seemed that higher CHR made this song more effective.  I was under<br/>
impression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind control<br/>
related songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.  Does anyone<br/>
know if higher CHR also effects Largos?  Its quite possible that the random<br/>
number generator was skewed in my favor and thats why I was having better<br/>
success with the high CHR.<br/>
