&gt;   On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party talked to a gm<br/>
&gt;and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
&gt;newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
&gt;perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it was just newbies complaining, that&#39;s kind of understandable.  Kithicor <br/>
can be dangerous if you wander around at lvl 5, or even lvl 10.  However, I <br/>
was a lvl 19 bard when in happened (just turned 20 last night!) and I died a <br/>
whopping 4 times in 4 hours just trying to get my corpse the heck OUT of <br/>
Kithicor.  It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know the way, but I was getting firebombed <br/>
by blood red zombies with HUGE aggro radiuses.  Yippee, it&#39;s a wonderful <br/>
event...  yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
I had passed through Beholder&#39;s Maze just because I heard the war was going <br/>
to happen in Highpass.  Since I knew that Verant never seems to have any <br/>
kind of event that&#39;s not designed for levels 30+, I knew it was something I <br/>
should probably avoid.  (BTW, kudos to Verant for the Qeynos hills invasion; <br/>
had something for everybody for once).  So I run out of Rivervale right <br/>
smack into the middle of it.  Of course I was thinking that I had just <br/>
passed the event (Highpass), I hadn&#39;t bothered to get bound.  So I&#39;m back in <br/>
Arena.  Travel all the way to Rivervale without a drum (no banks anywhere, <br/>
and even if I HAD any money, no place sells drums...).  Then I spent the <br/>
next hour just trying to get INTO Kithicor.  Finally made it (after getting <br/>
scared to death that my character had been deleted; rebooted and it was back <br/>
&lt;whew&gt;) only to be blinded and eventually killed by Hate (which was <br/>
acceptible, since I didn&#39;t lose any exp that time).<br/>
<br/>
Um, maybe I&#39;m just stupid, but don&#39;t you think that even if you&#39;re blind you <br/>
can still tell if you&#39;re dying and hear everything that&#39;s going on around <br/>
you?????<br/>
<br/>
OK, so then I spend the next 2 hours just trying to get my corpse (again) <br/>
out of Kithicor.  Now, if this had been held in Highpass as was rumored, at <br/>
least you can go around it.  Someone please tell me how you&#39;re supposed to <br/>
travel East without passing through Kithicor?  Well, short of &quot;beg some <br/>
high-level wizard to teleport you, that&#39;s not always an option, unless <br/>
Verant decides to set up Wizardly Travel Agency NPC&#39;s in each zone...<br/>
