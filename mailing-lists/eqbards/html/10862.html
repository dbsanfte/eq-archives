<div id="ygrps-yiv-122872290">In all honesty I too hate seeing a bard, and a level 1 bard mind you in<br/>
full rubicite wielding dual Ykeshas.  And yes I had that pang of jealousy<br/>
that we all succumb to, but really what are you in the game for?  If it<br/>
were not for the good friends that I have made I would have left this game<br/>
a long time ago.  I bet you remember how wild some of your adventures were<br/>
and not the 3 hour camp that you did to get a &lt;insert item name here&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
As for making items no drop, it would appease my jealous streak, but it<br/>
will also quell my good nature towards my friend.  As a present to my<br/>
friend who working on a new cleric, I camped 6 hours straight to get her a<br/>
set of barbed arms.  The camp was horrible, but I did love the thanks I<br/>
received from her... If items don&#39;t stroke my ego, then let my friends do<br/>
it for me.  In all truth I really wish some of the other quests were not<br/>
no drop so I could give gifts to my friends for their kindness and<br/>
understanding.<br/>

&gt; hehe, sounds like me, i hate seeing lev 14 bards in full lambent when my<br/>
&gt; bard still doesnt have boots or gloves. but hey, such is life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; as for the TBB, when my group camped for the masks, we got 3 masks that<br/>
&gt; night, and 1 burlap bag (yes he spawned).  but no TBB<br/>

&gt; &gt; Talk about tedious...I realize people&#39;s mileage may vary in respect to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; story I am about to tell, but...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; At level 35 I finally decided to go for the guise of the deceiver and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower guk for the first time in my career this past weekend.  On Sunday I<br/>
&gt; &gt; explored and got familiar with the undead area between the zone and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; assassin room.  On Monday I called out to be put on the mask list at 10am<br/>
&gt; &gt; CST.  I got into the assassin group by 5pm CST and finally looted the mask<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 10:30pm CST.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The whole time I was there, a friend from my guild was waiting for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; TBB.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He had been there for 24 hours straight and did not see one single pop of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ghoul supplier...he finally gave up and logged out due to exhaustion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that&#39;s an absurdly tedious camp, and I thought I was losing my mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; after 5 hours in that blasted assassin/supplier room.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For 5 of the hours we camped that room I was the group leader and it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; extremely hard because when you put 6 people in that tiny little room for<br/>
&gt; &gt; that long they start to get irritated and tempers start to flare...we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; more arguments over stupid inane stuff, mostly how to go about doing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; looting of the alleged TBB shout the elusive supplier spawn (I still have<br/>
&gt; &gt; not seen this supplier to date) that I never ever ever want to be in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; room again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But hey, I got my mask and only died twice for my efforts...heh.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also a late bloomer bard obtaining my lambent armor and I can identify<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Crier in his woes.  I just got my first piece, the breastplate, on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saturday night and before that I kept getting tells from strangers, &quot;why<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t you have any lambent armor yet?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Because I&#39;m not a twink!  I have earned every single item I have the hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; way and Faras is not only my first character in EQ, he is my only<br/>
&gt; &gt; character<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I have over 35 days played too...I am level 35 with one piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lambent.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hang in there Crier, don&#39;t pay attention to those that take the &quot;easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; path&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; because really, they are only hurting themselves.  Play the game you want<br/>
&gt; &gt; and enjoy it as long as can.  Solidarity!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;... Having a monster placeholder for a spawn that is 8 hours is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   absoultely ridiculous.  I don&#39;t envy clerics/shaman.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is obviously someone at Verant that needs the difference between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; challenging and tedious explained to him. Preferable by someone with a<br/>
