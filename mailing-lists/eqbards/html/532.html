a little coin. What is this Belt Quest that you speak of? Would a Bard of<br/>
the Seventh Circle be able to complete it?<br/>

&gt;Well thanks all for the information, think I&#39;ll just rough it and stick in <br/>
&gt;CB for money.  Also I found the belt quest in Kaladim semi satisfying since <br/>
&gt;I can drum run towards Kaladim and take those worthless belts to make 1 gp <br/>
&gt;from gems or bandages and such which isn&#39;t too bad.  Bards near Kelethin may <br/>
&gt;want to check into this to boast their funds also since we got it rough both <br/>
&gt;ways.<br/>
