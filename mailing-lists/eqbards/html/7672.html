<div id="ygrps-yiv-619965723">very true, i hope we can add this.  it is extremely hard to stack verses of<br/>
victory with any other song, usually trying to stack it with mystic<br/>
shielding.  so many missed notes i usually play one or the other.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Another thing you might want to add is it is near impossible <br/>
&gt; to stack your<br/>
&gt; high level songs (I miss on average 20-30 notes a fight <br/>
&gt; trying to twist<br/>
&gt; cessation and cresendo) So if ya think you are smashing <br/>
&gt; buttons now just<br/>
&gt; wait =) Maybe add in that our instrument skills should not be <br/>
&gt; capped at 200<br/>
&gt; but 250 or 255.. (Why on earth would they want to cap us in <br/>
&gt; these skills??)<br/>
&gt; I am fearing the thought of stacking Cessation and Verses...<br/>
&gt; As for skills the only one I am partial to is track...nice <br/>
&gt; high cap ; )<br/>
&gt; maybe hide would be good if they didn&#39;t cap it insanely low.<br/>
