<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-84166753">Hey Ninev, I noticed the fier&#39;dal weapons use regular mithril sheets.  Is<br/>
this true even for the Imbued Weapons?  What skill does one need to have a<br/>
reasonable success rate on them?  <br/>
<br/>
I have a ranger friend on E&#39;ci who&#39;d love to have a Tunare Rapier, what are<br/>
you selling them for?<br/>

Who knows? There seems to be little to base a guess on. The Fier&#39;Dal<br/>
series are all races but the Koda&#39;Dal are elf only and the Tier&#39;Dal are<br/>
Inkie/Human/Half/Troll. I&#39;d think that the halfling weapons might be<br/>
usable by up to at least elves to throw the halflings a marketable bone<br/>
but I&#39;m not too sure because the Dwarven weapons are limited to<br/>
stubbies alone. I do hope they implement bristlebane imbued Fier&#39;Dal<br/>
gear. I have druids and clerics waiting in line for Tunare and Karana<br/>
morningstars and a pile of people asking &quot;Can you make those rapiers in<br/>
Bristlebane?&quot; that I have to turn away. I think this new smithing is<br/>
great, I just wish there were more gem options. Who knows, Yak said<br/>
there would be more recipies added so there may just be some coming<br/>
down the pipe yet. As far as Bristlebane, if no Fier&#39;Dal flavors<br/>
arrive, I&#39;d look to the Gnomes before the Halflings.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as a point of clarity for those who don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t have to<br/>
worship the deity to make the weapons, just to imbue the gems and use<br/>
the gear.<br/>

&gt; So does that mean I can not equip these weapons since I don&#39;t worship<br/>
&gt; Tunare?  And if I can&#39;t equip weapons crafted by wood elves, could I<br/>
&gt; equip deity weapons crafted by halflings who worship Bristlebane?<br/>
