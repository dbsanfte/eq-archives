&gt;I haven&#39;t played it but supposedly Asheron&#39;s Call has this kind of feature.<br/>
&gt;From what I have heard, if you are faster than a mob and are running away<br/>
&gt;from it, after a certain amount of time it will lose interest in you.  I<br/>
&gt;would assume EQ programmers could figure out a way to implement a similar<br/>
&gt;feature in EQ if they wanted to.  Question is do they want to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The real solution is a time-based hatred demotion system,<br/>
&gt; &gt; where a mob&#39;s hatred for you (as well as your kill-credit<br/>
&gt; &gt; potential) declines over time the mob is not being attacked.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes this would be difficult; but if you&#39;re going to fix<br/>
&gt; &gt; something, fix it right.  Unless the problem is very<br/>
&gt; &gt; detrimental to the game (which feign death wasn&#39;t), don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; waste time going from one broken state to another broken<br/>
&gt; &gt; state.<br/>
