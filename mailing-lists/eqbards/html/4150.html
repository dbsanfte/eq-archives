<div id="ygrps-yiv-690627190">I was fighting spiders in E. Karana a while back and got &#39;Halfling <br/>
     parts&quot; as loot. (eeuuww) Twice.  Quite a shock.  I think it was salted <br/>
     by someone with a wicked sense of humor but I&#39;m not 100 percent sure.  <br/>
     It is conceivable that a giant spider would have Halfling parts <br/>
     (Samwise, where is Frodo anyway...) but I haven&#39;t seen this extreme <br/>
     level of humor before from variant.  Anyone else have a similar <br/>
     experience?<br/>

Yes you can place items on mobs. Often times when I forage something, or <br/>
just got done looting a mob, and another agro mob attacks, I simply click <br/>
the item to the mod, kill it then retrieve the items.<br/>
     <br/>
Which if bards had a more permanent charm song could really make a mean pack <br/>
animal/monster exploit.<br/>
