<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024839987"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I didn&#39;t realize Shamans got SoC that soon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some misperceptions about Spirit of Cheetah in these emails.<br/>
<br/>
SoC has a 45 second duration.<br/>
SoC has a 15 MINUTE recycle time.<br/>
SoC is self only.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of Cheetah is kinda like Divine Aura.  If you are in<br/>
deep doo-doo, click this button and run away to save your butt.<br/>
It&#39;s rarely used, and not practical or useful for travelling.<br/>
<br/>
A level 35 bard with MM drums can keep pace with SoC, if not<br/>
outrun it.  At level 40, as I said before...  I can&#39;t outrun<br/>
two things in the world:  Bards higher level than me, and <br/>
anything with Spirit of Norrath (shadowmen).<br/>
<br/>
Hell, I can even outrun GrimFeather in North Karana.  And he<br/>
flies faster than SoC.  Bards over level 38 with MM drums are <br/>
the only classes in the entire game that can escape him, based<br/>
on speed alone.  At level 36 or 37, GrimFeather will catch you<br/>
if you try to flee.  Keep that in mind.<br/>
