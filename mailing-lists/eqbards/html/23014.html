<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150341170">Well, I&#39;m not that far behind you, almost 36 now.  It has gotten better than<br/>
it was in the early 20&#39;s that&#39;s for certain.  But in the 8-12th level range<br/>
I was constantly amazed at what I could do with a little tactical<br/>
forethought.  Nowadays I&#39;m mostly amazed at what I can&#39;t do that it would<br/>
seem I should be able to.  I&#39;m the only hybrid in the guild that can&#39;t stand<br/>
up to a mob that&#39;s barely green to me and not lose 4 bubbles of health.<br/>
Admittedly I can fear chains it, but even then I usually take 1-2 bubbles<br/>
due to resists.  Our druid can kill 4 of the same mob all at once.<br/>
<br/>
In a group I see my flexibility increase, I can fill nearly whatever role<br/>
the group is missing, but in most of the groups I&#39;ve been in they aren&#39;t<br/>
missing any key element.  They usually have a healer, a tank, a nuker, and a<br/>
crowd controller.  The next two slots generally get filled with whatever is<br/>
available and if its me it means I&#39;m expected to play manasong nearly<br/>
continuously.  Oh and help tank.  Fortunately most groups don&#39;t actually<br/>
threaten to kick me out when I refuse to just play manasong in actual<br/>
combat.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s funny.  My hard period was around level 23-26.  Of <br/>
&gt; course, back then<br/>
&gt; Lullaby was an actual song, not a flashy method of suicide.  <br/>
&gt; Levels 8-12<br/>
&gt; were my favorites for a long while I think, Lament and Bellow <br/>
&gt; were extremely<br/>
&gt; useful back then and Warsong was still pretty new.  Carillion is still<br/>
&gt; probably the biggest non-roleplaying reason I don&#39;t quit <br/>
&gt; playing my bard.<br/>
