<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886396221">I love to party with rogues!  The mobs naturally wail on me and the rogue<br/>
backstabs like crazy! It&#39;s great fun to have them mobs flipping back and<br/>
forth every round! Hitting them so much they don&#39;t know which way to turn!<br/>
Rogues and Bards - great combo!<br/>

		Sure I have read everlore, eqvault, harpers, etc. but as<br/>
much as I had read<br/>
		what the effects of Anthem de Arms was, I was never able to<br/>
guage if the<br/>
		weapons speed increase was really working. Part of the<br/>
problem was that I<br/>
		use a Mino axe, (very heavy, long delay) and most of the<br/>
people that I group<br/>
		with are also using mino axes, or equally heavy/slow<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
		Last night I grouped with a rogue double wielding daggers. I<br/>
have never seen<br/>
		someone hit so hit a mob so many times in my life. It was<br/>
almost comical.<br/>

		Still being amazed<br/>
