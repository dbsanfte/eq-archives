<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215386902">The problem is mostly likely your new sound card, if it is a sound blaster<br/>
<br/>
I had the same prob with my SB live card, go to the offical EQ site, and<br/>
there is a troubleshooting guide that is very helpful, also there are links<br/>
to the drivers to dowload.<br/>

&gt; &gt; But anyway, that&#39;s the problem I can learn to live with.  What&#39;s killing<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; now is, I THINK, lag.   See, lag spikes on my old PC basically just made<br/>
&gt; &gt; movements slow and choppy.  What&#39;s happening now is my screen completely<br/>
&gt; &gt; locks up for about 20 seconds, during that time I&#39;ll hear about 5<br/>
seconds<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the me piercing something repeatedly, followed by 5ish seconds of me<br/>
&gt; &gt; screaming in agony repeatedly, followed by 5 seconds of the mob<br/>
&gt; &gt; barking/growling/etc, and so on.  It&#39;s like the client is playing all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sound effects of the battle in order of effect rather than<br/>
chronological.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I can do NOTHING while this is going on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to get something similar to this with my old pc when new graphics<br/>
&gt; loaded. Part of the problem was slow disk drives. Did you load the<br/>
&gt; motherboard udma drivers for your drives? Are they set up as mode 4 or<br/>
&gt; better in the bios? Do they show up in the control panel/system utility<br/>
&gt; as having dma enabled?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other thing I could see that would account for this is if you are<br/>
&gt; using one of those winmodems. Any modem that offloads any part of the<br/>
&gt; signal processing to the cpu can cause problems, especially with games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sound care drivers are another possibility. Go to the manufacturer&#39;s<br/>
&gt; website and download the latest drivers. If the chipset maker has their<br/>
&gt; own reference drivers, also try those.<br/>
