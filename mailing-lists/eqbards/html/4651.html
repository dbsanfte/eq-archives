<div id="ygrps-yiv-66015444">Bards are travelers, right?  People who play bards may be travelers, too,<br/>
right?  So this is bard related.  Right.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking into buying a laptop and obviously it has to run EverQuest<br/>
reasonably well.  Does anyone have experience with laptops and EverQuest,<br/>
or state-of-the-art games in general?<br/>
<br/>
The only experience I have so far is disappointment with the high-end<br/>
Toshiba provided for my job.  It has the one chipset EverQuest doesn&#39;t<br/>
support and when running in any graphic mode below 1024x768 it simply<br/>
reduces the size of what&#39;s displayed leaving a black border.  Is it<br/>
possible for an LCD not to do that?<br/>
<br/>
