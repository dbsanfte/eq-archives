&gt; Of course, if you were bright and immoral.. you could<br/>
&gt; simply do this twice, assuming you were group leader.  <br/>
&gt; Just make a few macros for some fake seed generations..<br/>

&gt; Cheetr could have rolled any number from 1 to 1000<br/>

everyone&#39;s roll carefully, into a problem where you have to<br/>
inspect only the leader&#39;s roll carefully.  And nobody will<br/>
complain if someone requests that the leader re-roll the seed<br/>
number, because it doesn&#39;t determine anything.<br/>
