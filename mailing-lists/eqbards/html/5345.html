<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048997821">I have a base 80 and I am a HE. I never put any effort into buffing my<br/>
strength, just the armors and items I chose happened to have some str buffs<br/>
attached an my str is 93. More than enough, way more. Now dont laugh and I<br/>
will explain myself. When do you need str? In a fight, right? If your party<br/>
doesnt have a Shaman, then your in trouble to begin with. Shamans are by far<br/>
the most necessary and versatile member of a party, next to a Bard of<br/>
course. I get a nice strength buff from him just the lil one that takes me<br/>
to 126 str, then in a fight I am playing Anthem, 136, then my PGT procs in<br/>
the fight, 156. Not too shabby. If he hits me with his 39th lvl str spell<br/>
and all these other things happen I have 173 strength, woohoo!. So basically<br/>
I put all my wearable buffs into dex/agil, also good stuff that a Shaman can<br/>
buff. I love looking at my stats during a fight though.<br/>
Dex=156<br/>
Agil=170<br/>
Str=173<br/>
Stam=125<br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby! Get a Shaman.<br/>

weight is only a problem when you&#39;re high teens/early 20&#39;s.  after that you<br/>
start making money, get str items.<br/>
<br/>
my base str is 85, with my items im up to 112str. 2 str earings +3 each.<br/>
jagged bands(+3str/5ac) are not bad rings, but the +4str/+2wis rings are<br/>
nicer (jeweler made, think they&#39;re ruby electrum.  Plat Ruby veil<br/>
(+7str,+7wis). black iron crown(5ac, +5 str and +5 all resists) or if you&#39;re<br/>
lucky a crested helm (+6str/+3charisma 10ac). Another nice item if you can<br/>
get one is a golden pearl choker, doesnt give str but +7 agi and +7dex.<br/>
<br/>
you see there&#39;s plenty of str buffers out there, im wearing full steel<br/>
medium plate and weight about 82-83, leaves me a good 20 to stock up on<br/>
junk, but we go for giants, which drop more platinum that FS weapons (which<br/>
make you heavy)<br/>

&gt; Calm down bevis, it&#39;s just a game.  My str right now<br/>
&gt; is around 125 with items, and I have a light burlap<br/>
&gt; sack that makes everything weightless and doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; dissapear.  Yes, I was worried about weight a while<br/>
&gt; back, but it&#39;s not much of a problem anymore<br/>
