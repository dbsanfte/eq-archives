I was going to ask you about this.  We took a group of about 40 level 50+<br/>
folks in there Friday night.  That 40 was made up largely of the most<br/>
seasoned players out of the biggest, baddest guild on Druzzil Ro.  Venril<br/>
Sathir completely and utterly destroyed us and he hardly looked up from his<br/>
breakfast to do it.  If we ever had him down to 90% I&#39;d be surprised, as we<br/>
seemed to make absolutely zero dent in his HPs.  The interesting thing is<br/>
that after the battle was over the Senior Guide on our server (a notorious<br/>
hardass) summoned our corpses to the zone for us.  She cited bad pathing,<br/>
low framerates and &quot;server burping&quot; as the reasons (several of us had gone<br/>
LD).  She said when she first tried to zone into Karnor&#39;s after the battle<br/>
that she couldn&#39;t.  She also said that she thought that VS had been beefed<br/>
in the latest patch...  After our attempt on VS mobs weren&#39;t spawning in the<br/>
zone anymore and she had to kick everyone out and repop it.  It was an<br/>
ordeal, but thank god she summoned corpses.  40 corpses as VS&#39;s feet was<br/>
going to be a tough CR.<br/>
<br/>
So VS is on our &quot;unkillable&quot; list, at least for the time being.  A Warrior<br/>
in my guild said &#39;It&#39;s gonna be a long time before I get my Cobalt Greaves.&#39;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; btw, as of the last patch he is back to &quot;unkillable.&quot;  i wasn&#39;t there (was<br/>
&gt; at work) but when i logged on after work and saw him on track in<br/>
&gt; Karnor&#39;s, i<br/>
&gt; knew something bad happened, and found out he was beefed up bigtime.<br/>
