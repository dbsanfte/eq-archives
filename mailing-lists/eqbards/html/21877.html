<b>Subject:</b> Drum model and stuff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-356897128">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 The drum thing bugs me. We said in beta, why do we strum a stick? they<br/>
said, it&#39;s beta we&#39;ll fix it. Release, we still strum a stick, they say we<br/>
forgot to do the drum. Drum gets likened to the barb shield thing, it&#39;s too<br/>
big, maybe we can fix it later. Something like a year later, new lands (and<br/>
all that modeling) still a stick. Nostrolo&#39;s tamborine gets turned into a<br/>
tamborine instead of a stick, all drums are still sticks. Give me odds the<br/>
next addition and the chance to recitfy the drum thing and avoid the large<br/>
d/l (cited as a main drawback to fixing) still won&#39;t have a drum. I&#39;ve<br/>
played a bard for 2 years as of next month, and that seems like a damn long<br/>
time for something to be outstanding. It says they either don&#39;t care or they<br/>
are simply unable to deal with the volume of problems they have. Granted I<br/>
am a perfectionist, and spent 15 years in Nuclear Maintenance to make it<br/>
worse. We tracked outstanding issues based on severity AND the length of<br/>
time the issue was outstanding. The NRC is very interested in cycle times.<br/>
The point was long cycle times says the management of the facility was<br/>
lacking in commitment and efficiency, and would get a plant on the Watch<br/>
list as fast as a real incident. Gaming is not nuclear power of course, but<br/>
the same indicators apply to any industry.<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, I have been in Sebilis the last 2 weekends. My cleric and<br/>
I either join a group or form one. When no enchanter is available, I have<br/>
been doing the crowd control. My best is to charm one, have it fight the<br/>
second or use the 53 mez. The best I can do is 2 mobs mez&#39;ed. I just don&#39;t<br/>
seem to have time to get a 3rd effectively. I was actually down to one<br/>
bubble of mana left at one point, and we were just at bridge 3. The pickup<br/>
wizard was annoyed that I wasn&#39;t singing clarity the whole time. :)<br/>
