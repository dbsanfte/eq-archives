 </span></blockquote>I wanted to clarify:<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t get early breaks.  I said that they weren&#39;t as<br/>
prolific as you were implying.  I was in the magi room last night, as the<br/>
only snarer (the necro was our cleric, and the fights were relatively short,<br/>
so he wasn&#39;t darknessing).  In three hours of nearly constant pulls, I got<br/>
11 early breaks and 2 immediate breaks; these numbers are typical of what I<br/>
expect from blue mobs from past experience.  My Charisma has always been<br/>
between 123 and 148 (currenly 133), if that has anything to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether or not the recent patch made that the breaks more frequent, I<br/>
can&#39;t attest to that, since my sample time was only 3 hours, and I could<br/>
have been getting lucky with the RNG.<br/>
