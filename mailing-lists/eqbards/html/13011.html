<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436206900">Hehe - sounds like you need a new guild.  Our guild leader spends a great<br/>
deal of his time basically doing nothing - &quot;/shout level 50 wiz looking for<br/>
a group!&quot; So, he is happy to move us around, log in a lev 50 cleric and res<br/>
us as needed.  If they are breaking planes, raiding boots or dragons,<br/>
obviously you gotta wait or deal with it.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple weekends ago, in a hi-mid 30&#39;s guild group we went to the live side<br/>
and we took the jail room. The login server crashed and I went LinkDead.  I<br/>
could not get back in and gave up trying after a couple hours.  Next<br/>
morning, I wanted to play but did not want to &quot;bother&quot; the 50&#39;s.  So, I<br/>
studied a map real carefully and uncamped. There I was - face to face with a<br/>
room full of froogys.  I mashed screetch and took off for the exit.  The<br/>
froogys were not my problem but the mino-cows were. Stunned, spun, and<br/>
smooshed.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I had to fess up and get some help.  And I was very embarrassed since<br/>
this was like my first week in the guild.  But they were real nice and both<br/>
a 50 wiz and 50 clr who were not busy came and got me.  &quot;Wow, you made it<br/>
much further than I expected!  But really, there is no need for that - just<br/>
ask us next time.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My guild is quite a unique group of people.  The &#39;culture&#39; is one of making<br/>
everyone better.  They think about how they can get things for other&#39;s and<br/>
work hard to make sure that everyone has the best stuff.  I was really<br/>
impressed when I saw how much they think about others in the guild.  I hear<br/>
&quot;we have to get (this item)... for (that person)...&quot; much more that I hear<br/>
&quot;who will help me get this...&quot; As a result we have a really good team.  <br/>
<br/>
What you say about respecting their time is correct.  I don&#39;t expect them to<br/>
drop what they are doing and help little old me.  Even so, they are willing<br/>
to help us mid levels grow.  Here&#39;s an example:  we had 2 groups in Guk -<br/>
one camping the frenzy and the other camping the king. I was with the frenzy<br/>
crew and had 2 50 ench, 1 50 cleric, a 40ish tank and me bard 40.  The king<br/>
room called for some help and one of the enchanters ran over.  Then he<br/>
called for some help and the cleric gated over.  <br/>
<br/>
Hehe, then our room spawned and we needed some help.  The enchanter and the<br/>
tank were down to less than half a bub of hp and dropping and getting<br/>
stunned/interrupted.  So, I equipped my lute and played hymn.  More out of<br/>
instinct and last ditch attempt to heal (I think I cast minor heal on the<br/>
tank with my crude stein too.)  Anyhow the frenzy or bloodthristy objected<br/>
to me helping them and he helped himself to me. The others lived and in<br/>
short order I was ressed back. <br/>
<br/>
Different guilds have different attitudes.  I am not afraid to ask mine for<br/>
help and they are not afraid to say &#39;sorry&#39; if they are busy.  But we got a<br/>
lot of high levels and a bunch of us have 2 pc&#39;s and can run 2 logins at the<br/>
same time.  That along with some strategic binds makes things work quite<br/>
smoothly.  <br/>

Please don&#39;t ask guild clerics to run halfway across the world to rez you<br/>
(or even up from the deep part of the dungeons) Its rude and it impinges on<br/>
THEIR time. Esp because, if they are guild, they don&#39;t feel like they can<br/>
say No. A guild&#39;s purpose is not to provide teleporters/rezzes. If you want<br/>
these, get in a group where one of your members can do it.</div>
