<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106085217">The ranger will try to snare/root you and shoot lots of arrows.  He will<br/>
also try to cast his DD &  DoT and have his Thorns and buffs up on himself.<br/>
He also has some minor heals for himself.<br/>
<br/>
I would have elemental & guardian memmed and maybe the disenchanting melody<br/>
(if not - have a egg-shaped pumice handy  they can dispell roots - not sure<br/>
about snares).  Selos, hymn, lullaby or pixie, bellow or denon&#39;s, screetch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would start with my MR maxxed out - weaving ele & guardian.  Ranger mana<br/>
is weak and he may panic when you resist and re-cast.  The more you can make<br/>
him cast the better. Get close to him and stay inside bow range.  Use songs<br/>
to damage at first because he will be thorned.  <br/>
<br/>
You might try to fear chain him if you are not in the arena but just out in<br/>
a zone.  (hehe if you can pick the spot - charm an HG or Griffon &lt;eg&gt;)  Once<br/>
you have made him use up his mana, you can play lullaby and continue song<br/>
damage.  They really hate being winced.  <br/>
<br/>
Depending on how long the fight goes, his thorns may wear off. I&#39;d try to<br/>
wait as long as possible to melee him to prevent taking damage from his<br/>
shield of thorns.  And you can play the same game with Psalm of Warmth. If<br/>
you run away to heal or load a different song - remember he has tracking so<br/>
run to a zone edge where tracking gets all messed up.<br/>
<br/>
But like Harm said - you might be well served to go down in the 3rd round<br/>
for future peace and harmony ;p<br/>

		Hello friends,<br/>
<br/>
		As a fellow bard I am faced with a great duel in less than a<br/>
months time.<br/>
		This duel will be fought between a level 30-33 bard and a<br/>
similarly<br/>
		leveled ranger.  From what I have read on the groups most of<br/>
the dueling<br/>
		results have been for extremely high level people like Shada<br/>
and a few<br/>
		lower level duels.  What I am looking for is some sort of<br/>
tactics to be<br/>
		used in the battle.  <br/>
<br/>
		Please understand that the ranger I will be facing will be<br/>
wielding many<br/>
		items that are above her level like Raincaller, Short Sword<br/>
of Morin, and<br/>
		Thulian Bladed Claw.<br/>
<br/>
		Also some thoughts... am I expected to lose?<br/>
