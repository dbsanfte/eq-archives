&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grats!  Great to hear everything worked out so well!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While we&#39;re on the topic of hardware...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you decide to buy an Intel P4, you&#39;re most likely gonna be happy...if,<br/>
&gt; that is, you don&#39;t mind spending more.  Historically, Intel processors are<br/>
&gt; more expensive than AMD processors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Additionally, if you select Intel P4, you will be required to<br/>
&gt; also purchase<br/>
&gt; a new type of memory (RAMBUS - if my memory serves...heh).  This memory is<br/>
&gt; much, much more expensive than the typical memory you see advertised today<br/>
&gt; (eg: $65 for 256MB RAM).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, RAMBUS is much more expensive, however, Intel is working with it&#39;s own<br/>
and 3rd party motherboard manufacturers to get SDRAM and DDR SDRAM (double<br/>
data rate) mobo&#39;s working w/ P4, last I heard, expect them to be out before<br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The bottom line is, do your homework before you buy computers or computer<br/>
&gt; parts.  Pricewatch.com is an excellent source, and I have the<br/>
&gt; Google toolbar<br/>
&gt; as part of my browser.  :)  Know what you&#39;re buying, and what<br/>
&gt; your money is<br/>
&gt; being spent on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, don&#39;t forget the &quot;arcane&quot; science of overclocking.  :)  With proper<br/>
&gt; cooling, you can get an 800Mhz processor to 1Ghz.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ Everquest.  PIII<br/>
600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in old world zones,<br/>
any 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I think it was a<br/>
500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>
input/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything using directx,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Feel free to email me directly for directions to the best (IMHO)<br/>
&gt; overclockers info/support site on the internet.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you try this, good luck, hopefully better than mine :)  (a friend of mine<br/>
has a piii-7xx(?), overclocked to 1.2ghz, plays all manner of 3d games, and<br/>
loves it, he&#39;s also running 1gb of ram...and about a dozen fans in his case)<br/>
