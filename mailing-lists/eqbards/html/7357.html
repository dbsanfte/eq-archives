<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727842095">Umm....sorry about that last post(for me, it came thru as a message about<br/>
spoiler stuff, some spoiler space, and half of an old message from the previous<br/>
digest)...dunno what happened to the info that i had typed up...got lost in a<br/>
zone crash i guess ;P<br/>
<br/>
Ok....the Crystal Staves location info:<br/>

Water Crystal Staff-&gt; Webclaw Murkwave, Named mob underwater in Lake Rathe. <br/>
you have to fight him underwater, and he is a caster.  he will 32K if you pull<br/>
him on land. (and i have heard that he 32k&#39;s if you don&#39;t kill him in a certain<br/>
amount of time)<br/>
Slime Crystal Staff-&gt;  Off of King Xorbb in the Gorge....<br/>
Fire Crystal Staff-&gt;  Off of Goblin Drunkard in Solusek A.  I think he is a<br/>
rare wanderer...don&#39;t think he has a fixed spawn point or time.<br/>
Ice Crystal Staff-&gt;  Off of Goblin Scryer in Permafrost.  Fixed spawn i<br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know who you give the staves to for any quest...but i believe that the<br/>
Visiting Priestess in Najena has something to do with the Blued two-Handed<br/>
Hammer quest.  Alas, non-evils are KOS to her, so i have no other info to<br/>
provide.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, this info will not come thru as a half-a-message again.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
