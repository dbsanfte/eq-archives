<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014334131">If it&#39;s lifetap you need to have the bards sing &quot;Purifying Rhytms&quot; I would<br/>
also throw in Hymn and Nivs and the 50+ healing song as well.  That should<br/>
help to counter the lifetap nicely.  Alternately sing Purifying Rhythms, FCC<br/>
and TCF.  Also any poison resist spells your clerics/shaman/druids can cast<br/>
on you.  Lifetap is a Poison Resist Check.<br/>
<br/>
Maestro of Rancor uses a Lifetap type spell that does nearly as much dmg<br/>
which is area affect and using poison resistance gear/songs/spells people<br/>
can usually take him down without too much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; We took 36ish people to take him on after the patch and the amount of<br/>
sheer<br/>
&gt; &quot;ownage&quot; had us all laughing our asses off. If this had been nagafen we<br/>
&gt; woulda spanked him soundly with zero deaths and clerics all at 50% mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It wasnt nagafen it was Venril unfortunately. He methodically knocked out<br/>
&gt; the tanks one by one in such a systematic manor that everybody was just<br/>
&gt; waiting their time patiently to die. Nuke&#39;s hit him for full damage and<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; 320 melee is laughable. But his 2k&#39;ish lifetap every few seconds just<br/>
&gt; decimated us one by one till we called evac on the one group remaining. We<br/>
&gt; all had over 200mr thanks to the bards and enchanter buffs but it made<br/>
&gt; little to no difference. He was at either 90% to FH when it was all over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as strategy, all i can think of since mr didnt seem to do anything<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; figuring out whether his lifetap is a spell or a proc. If it its a spell<br/>
&gt; then mana drains are the order of the day, if its a proc, then we have to<br/>
&gt; get turgurs on him before anybody bothers nuking or hittin him. I tried my<br/>
&gt; Brusco&#39;s stun on him and he just resisted (stuck on lvl 60 ancient wyv&#39;s<br/>
&gt; np), same with fear. Maybe stuns will stick if you have enough being<br/>
casted<br/>
&gt; on him, but either way you have to prevent that &quot;You feel a tugging at<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; soul&quot; from going off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody has any luck or knows any strategy suggestions please share =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; we grabbed 2 warrior, 2 rogue, 1 cleric, and 1 bard legs from him before<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; got beefed up.  i think that warrior is right before a new strategy is<br/>
&gt; &gt; devised.<br/>
