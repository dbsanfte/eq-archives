&gt; I dont quite understand.  Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear, I meant the widgets are<br/>
&gt; on named all over the same dungeon, thus making pulling them to one room<br/>

all 8 items.  Gotcha.  Still, I can see people camping one<br/>
spot until they get an item, moving on to the next until they<br/>
get that item, etc.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll systematically<br/>
clear as they sweep through the dungeon.<br/>
