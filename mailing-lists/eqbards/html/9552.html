PLANE ITEM UPDATE<br/>
From what I have seen in game today it would appear that certain classes<br/>
equipment are specific to a particular plane.<br/>
<br/>
Magician Items spawn on Male Revenant&#39;s in Hate.<br/>
Enchanter Items spawn on Female Revenant&#39;s in Hate.<br/>
Wizard Items spawn on Frightfinger&#39;s in Fear.<br/>
Necromancer Items spawn on Boogeymen in Fear.<br/>
Off topic a little, but it also appears that Monk, Paladin, Shadowknight and<br/>
Ranger armour is all in Fear. Whilst Shaman, Bard, Rogue, Warrior and Cleric<br/>
armour is in Hate.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which mob drops the bard armor? I heard tell that bard armor has been<br/>
&gt; moved from PoF  (boogeymen) to PoH.<br/>
&gt; Mummy monks - warrior armor, clerics of innorukk - cleric armor, male<br/>
&gt; revenants - mage armor, female revenants - enchanter armor, gargoyles -<br/>
&gt; rogue armor, spite golems - shaman armor.<br/>
&gt; Now this leaves a few mobs.. the ire (somethings or other. they look<br/>
&gt; like ghouls), the ashenbone drakes  (mini dracoliches), the scorn<br/>
&gt; banshees, the liches (mini spectres), and possibly some other mobs left<br/>
&gt; that i didnt see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone knows, please do tell.<br/>
