<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135954221">I paid close attention to this last night. My partner is a Shaman, thus I am<br/>
a buffaholic. He buffs Dex Str Agil Char, because he realizes the effects<br/>
all these have on other factors in a fight. So I have Dex=160 Agil=164<br/>
Str=155 Char=122. In battle I am twisting Anthem,Chain,Bellow. I am level 37<br/>
my skills in all instruments and voice are 190 and I should never miss a<br/>
note on these songs. There can only be one explanation for missing as many<br/>
notes as I am, Verant botched the patch! I know it sounds hard to believe,<br/>
but its the only reason I am all of a sudden having this problem. Any other<br/>
explanation is crap. We only started having this problem when they patched<br/>
the the Missed Notes on high level songs last patch. We all need to /bug and<br/>
/petition this everynight to get it fixed, or get a real explanation of<br/>
whats going on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Something is &quot;up&quot; - I have dex/agi at high 90&#39;s and am not <br/>
&gt;seeing this missed note problem.  I used carrillion last night <br/>
&gt;and it fired off on one click.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is everyone using CCC to try to determine failures?<br/>
You use this song about 2% of the time you play EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I think these things have little to do with failures also:<br/>
<br/>
LEVEL - I mean I miss on Jig constantly.  I got it 22 levels ago.<br/>
DEX   - I gave high 90s dexerity.  It&#39;s not much, but look at all <br/>
        the bards who said they have 140 something.<br/>
AGI   - I have over 100 agility.  Over 100 anything is above average.<br/>
        Again, many bards with extremely high agility miss notes.<br/>
CHA   - I&#39;ve been shaman &#39;snake&#39; buffed with various CHA items.<br/>
        Zero difference, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
I think those of you who want to do a &#39;real world&#39; test, should<br/>
twist anthem and hymm (a very common twist) 100 times and check<br/>
missed note rates.  Do not equip an instrument, pretend like you<br/>
are fighting with weapons up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the fact that it&#39;s hard to start a song.  That&#39;s due to lack<br/>
of the required skill or possibly if you just learned the song.<br/>
It&#39;s the fact that you are constantly stopping and starting songs, and <br/>
each time a song check is made.<br/>
<br/>
I usually end up twisting two party songs, and one target song.  This<br/>
is also a very good test.  Try anthem, hymm, and chains or bellow.<br/>
<br/>
Trying running from south karana bridge to lake rathe, and twist anthem<br/>
and accelerando at the same time.  Count the misses.  I think moving<br/>
around is when I&#39;ve seen the most misses.<br/>
<br/>
Standing in front of any merchant and playing CCC to test your<br/>
failure rate is slightly unrealistic.  So is standing in Qeynos<br/>
clicking one song on and off over and over.  Try moving, try mixing,<br/>
try fighting and testing at the same time.<br/>
