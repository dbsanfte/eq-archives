&gt; &gt;I&#39;m interested in why you think &quot;The Bard was never intended to be a<br/>
&gt; &gt;grunt-class.&quot;  Why do you say that?  We can use all the &quot;grunt&quot; weapons except<br/>
&gt; &gt;the big two handers.  We have strength as a major attribute, just like the<br/>
&gt; &gt;grunts.  How are we not a &quot;big burly type&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t have the HP that the grunts do (not by a long shot).  We don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the innate combat abilities they do.  Although we *can* act like<br/>
&gt; tanks, and we *can* solo, that is not our strength.  If you can get it to<br/>
&gt; work for you, good on ye, mate.<br/>

wear plate... so why would we not be able to?<br/>
