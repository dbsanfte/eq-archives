<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012205708">Not sure about mem blur in charm - probably - but ANY of our songs can be<br/>
used for this purpose. Pull something like this with chains - or hit<br/>
lullaby - and your lowbie friends will love you to death. I used to do this<br/>
with bandits in lesser fay all the time (once they can&#39;t hit ya - they<br/>
can&#39;t hurt ya) while the little bugs were wackin at their backsides. Took<br/>
next to forever, but the xp to low level folks was most excellent.<br/>

&gt;I was showing off for some newbie friends once at the chessboard in BB and I<br/>
&gt;charmed a skeletal knight and told it to sit down.  We all got a good laugh<br/>
&gt;and I said, &quot;when it stands back up, attack it...if you get in trouble I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;recharm it and let you heal up.&quot;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, the skeleton broke charm and my two friends proceeded to beat the<br/>
&gt;marrow of it.  Keep in mind I have not struck the skeleton one, just charmed<br/>
&gt;it.  The fight lasted about a minute and the skeleton never stopped hitting<br/>
&gt;me the whole time...it had absolutely no concern whatsoever that there were<br/>
&gt;two con green PCs standing behind it killing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Hmmmmm....&quot; I thought, and I helped my two friends get to their next level<br/>
&gt;killing one yellow after another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think charm has mem blur, doesn&#39;t it? I once saved myself from a KSing<br/>
&gt;nuker in Highkeep by charming the gobbie he was trying to nuke while I was<br/>
&gt;meleeing.  Not knowing what was going on  he continued to blow mana on it,<br/>
&gt;then I let it break charm and finished it off. </span></blockquote></div>
