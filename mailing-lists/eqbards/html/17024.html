&gt; Interesting numbers.  Did you do the timings on your lvl 50 bard singing<br/>
&gt; the songs on himself and then the enchanter casting spells on himself?<br/>
&gt; What was the original weapon delay?  Not that these numbers aren&#39;t grossly<br/>
&gt; apparent, but if you did use the songs/spells on different characters, how<br/>
&gt; did you control for intrinsic differences?  Also, I take it these numbers<br/>
&gt; were from combat?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes the bard numbers were with the bard, and the Quickness<br/>
numbers were with the enchanter.  I put an instrument into my<br/>
shield hand and punched mobs with stopwatch in hand.  The<br/>
first timing for the bard is unenhanced (no songs).  When I<br/>
did it with the enchanter, I also ran 3 unenhanced timings to<br/>
make sure the delay was the same as for the bard.  It was.<br/>

put SLtW at twice the speedup of Verses.  I don&#39;t mind that a<br/>
L49 spell is that superior to our L50 song.  Yes it&#39;s twice<br/>
the speedup, but if you look at it comparatively, it is only a<br/>
23% improvement over just using Verses.<br/>
<br/>
But for a L16 spell (which due to the exponential exp system<br/>
means probably about 1/20th the played time) to be equal to<br/>
our L50 song is... nauseating is a good word.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been planning to do timings with a FS dagger and rusty<br/>
mace tonight (was /auctioning &quot;Looking for a rusty mace - will<br/>
pay 2pp&quot; last night :).  But looks like we got scheduled for a<br/>
Fear trip at the last minute...<br/>
