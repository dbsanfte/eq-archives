&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin<br/>
&gt; drum&quot; that he<br/>
&gt; said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend<br/>
&gt; who tested<br/>
&gt; it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
&gt; drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
&gt; like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s rediculous.  15% OVER the MM Battle Drum and dropped in Kedge Keep?<br/>
Hell that&#39;s god loot stats, not a drum dropped by some fish in Kedge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after<br/>
&gt; Verant &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any knowledge/comments on these rumors?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Ykesha IMO is not worth 10kpp of stuff, especially since the WAR-only<br/>
Ykesha rumor has been publically denied by Verant.  Can you imagine groups<br/>
of six warriors camping the Ghoul Lord.  That I&#39;d like to see - I&#39;ll bring<br/>
bandages.  That room is a handful to hold with a balanced group of 45-50s<br/>
including a Cleric.<br/>
