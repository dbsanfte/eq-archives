&gt;Yes of course you will make level 50.  However, bards are group-centric<br/>
&gt;class, so if your aim is to more or less solo to 50 I&#39;d look at Necros or<br/>
&gt;Druids (but bards are much more fun).  Soloing is very difficult past about<br/>
&gt;level 12, so if you&#39;re soloing now, that is probably why you&#39;re seeing your<br/>
&gt;experience slow down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually your ability to solo gets a big boost at 18th lvl when you get <br/>
Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.  Just get your brass skill maxed at 18th then <br/>
use the all instrument attack (Horn + Discord, equip Lute play Chords of <br/>
Dissounce, play Hymn of Restoration, equip Horn & play Discord, repeat.)  <br/>
You will take down blues & some whites with little or no down time.  By the <br/>
time this gets too dangerous for solo work you get charm & fear.  Then you <br/>
can solo by getting two like leveled mobs to kill each other & fear/chain <br/>
the victor.  Also at that time (high 20&#39;s) you can go to the High Keep <br/>
basement.  I found this a great place for pick up parties, and since you can <br/>
be bound in the same zone your downtime due to death is virtually nil.<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting!<br/>
