&gt; &gt; Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum&quot; that he<br/>
&gt; &gt; said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; who tested<br/>
&gt; &gt; it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s rediculous.  15% OVER the MM Battle Drum and dropped in Kedge Keep?<br/>
&gt; Hell that&#39;s god loot stats, not a drum dropped by some fish in Kedge.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Err, even been to Kedge?  Swirlspines, Estrella, Phinegal, and some others are all 49+.<br/>
<br/>
Its no wimpy dungeon. :)  Phin is way easier than Naggy, but he still takes a few parties.<br/>
Currently Kedge has kind of crappy loot for the risk involved, so this would be an<br/>
awfully pleasant suprise.  I&#39;ve spent a bunch of time there, but are a few named spawns<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of that don&#39;t show up on any spoiler sites yet.  I&#39;ll have to ask my warrior<br/>
friend who practically lives there.<br/>
