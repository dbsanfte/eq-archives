<div id="ygrps-yiv-972838827">We&#39;re talking about the same thing.  If we had a balanced group of 5 a necro<br/>
would increase our power more as a 6th member than any other class would.<br/>
If we weren&#39;t already balanced as a group of 5 that would be a different<br/>
thing.  It tells me that every instance where I&#39;ve been in a group of 5 and<br/>
had multiple choices for a 6th, the necro was taken in every instance except<br/>
the one time where I was the only tank.  Every other time the group had no<br/>
glaring weaknesses, so the player with the greatest power to offer was<br/>
selected and every time it was the necro.  To quote our group leader&#39;s<br/>
favorite saying, &quot;Why add a 6th when we can get a necro and add a 7th at the<br/>
same time?&quot;<br/>

I think we&#39;re arguing about 2 different things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about a full group.  There are other classes I would far prefer<br/>
over a necro (Enchanter, Bard, a good tank, Cleric)  If I had a group and<br/>
needed a 6th and a necro came up, I&#39;d take him.<br/>
<br/>
But, full group vs full group There are many classes I would prefer over a<br/>
necro.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t _good_ in a group.  I&#39;m saying there are other<br/>
classes that are far more efficient in a group and more advantageous.  David<br/>
posted some VERY good points that I agree with 100% regarding this<br/>
discussion.  Bottom line:  Necro&#39;s aren&#39;t as good in a group as they are<br/>
solo.  But they are still &quot;ok&quot; in a group though there are other classes I<br/>
would highly prefer over one if given the choice in a _full_ group.<br/>
<br/>
Which is what I&#39;ve been stating all along.<br/>

&gt; &gt;True, he does, but a well balanced group _without_ a necro is far better<br/>
&gt; &gt;than a well balanced group _with_ a necro.  A good group will kill things<br/>
&gt; &gt;far faster than a necro can solo thus his &quot;real&quot; damage never gets<br/>
started.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Necro&#39;s are very weak in groups because there&#39;s no time for their DoT&#39;s<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;ramp up in dmg.  Typically it takes a full minute or more for a Necro DOT<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;realize full potential in dmg.  Most fights with a good group last far<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; &gt;than that (unless you&#39;re talking dragons/planes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I totally disagree.  If the group of 5 can handle mob X and you add a<br/>
necro<br/>
&gt; who can solo mob Y, the necro can effectively fight mob Y separately while<br/>
&gt; you kill Mob X a couple of times adding to the xp of all.  For most<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; Mob Y in this example would be half the level of Mob X, for the Necro Mob<br/>
Y<br/>
&gt; is 2-5 levels below Mob X at most.  Adding a Necro wisely can nearly<br/>
double<br/>
&gt; the xp if the mobs are available.<br/>
