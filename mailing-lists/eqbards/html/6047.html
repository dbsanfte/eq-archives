<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629468685"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;They will kill you if you think you are gonna tank damage.<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;ve got no hp.  At level 31, I have 700 or<br/>
&gt;so hp.  I&#39;m fighting monsters that do 50 - 80 damage a pop,<br/>
&gt;and sometimes double attack.  It is YOUR job to pull out as<br/>
&gt;soon as possible from a confrontation, and let the tank TAUNT<br/>
&gt;it off you always.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One note, if we examine the group I am in, there is one warrior, a cleric<br/>
(who of course can&#39;t tank worth anything at his level) and a wizard. We have<br/>
tried having me play instruments but I still do too much melee damage to<br/>
simply play. So the cleric/warrior keep me alive (they are husband and wife<br/>
and in the same room so they work GREAT together) and I melee. I don&#39;t see<br/>
this changing for a long time, unless we get another tank (which I would<br/>
LOVE). But good players are hard to come by, so we will see.<br/>
<br/>
I would play the horn in big mobs but we seem to have better luck with<br/>
focusing on one mob at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and really, nothing beats (the not uncommon occurence of ) having our<br/>
48th level shaman friend drop by to buff us...*laughs* &quot;Hi I am Tszaaz the<br/>
level 23 Bard with 1004 hitpoints!&quot;<br/>
