<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hmmm,  I thought (heard rumor) that you had to attack an underwater goblin<br/>
&gt;and pull him out of the water (and then zone because he was a deep red) -<br/>
&gt;and that would trigger Webclaw to spawn outside of the water at the base of<br/>
&gt;the Fire Tower.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had never heard that.  I have been there several times, and Webclaw has been<br/>
there 90% of the time (no triggers needed) and the other 10% were placeholders.<br/>
(The placeholder is Green to Webclaw, or damn close to it)<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the thing about having to fight him underwater, but watching my<br/>
friend fight him (lvl 34 druid) he could not pull him out of the water.  he<br/>
tried 3 times and all three times he 32K&#39;d.  so, he just killed him underwater<br/>
and had no problems.  I know the Underwater AI has some *Issues* so maybe he<br/>
was just doing things in a way that it didn&#39;t like.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
