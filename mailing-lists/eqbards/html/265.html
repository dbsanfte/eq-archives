 </span></blockquote>Funny you mention that, because while I do not belong to a guild, my<br/>
group of close friends practice just that.<br/>
I locate corpses, and only ask gratitude in return (given reasonable<br/>
risk, of course).<br/>
My friend sharpens the looted &#39;cheap&#39; swords and gives them out to<br/>
new players.<br/>
A mage friend needs platinum for a new spell?  Not a problem.<br/>
Most of their armour was tailored by me (before it was replaced by<br/>
better items, looted from corpses).<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even like to hazard a guess as to how much platinum has<br/>
flowed back and forth, with scarcely a moment&#39;s thought.<br/>
And partying with them is a pleasure.  Alpha loot?  *snort*.  Haha.<br/>
We trust each other enough to divide the loot evenly, once sold.<br/>
<br/>
Playing with people you know and trust does truely make the game much<br/>
more enjoyable.<br/>
I recommend that you find a group of like-minded people and enjoy the<br/>
game together.  Official guild or not, it adds much to the game.<br/>

PS. Don&#39;t take this to mean that I don&#39;t talk to strangers.  Strangers<br/>
are frequenly welcomed into our parties, and most prove to be capable<br/>
and competent people.  Just watch out for those that aren&#39;t!!</div>
