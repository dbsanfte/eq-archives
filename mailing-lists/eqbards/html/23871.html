<div id="ygrps-yiv-264341625">Heh I had an attack of the &quot;Play song XXXXXX&quot; characters this weekend.  From<br/>
lvl 52 paladins who insist their guild has extensivly tested all bard haste<br/>
songs and they ALL stack with enchanter haste.  To lvl XX drewd who insisted<br/>
I wasn&#39;t playing mana song since she was always LOM (I personally think it<br/>
had more to do with her casting group damage shield after our puller (and<br/>
only tank, sans the necro skelly) had left to pull).  I stood right next to<br/>
her, watched the blue particles on her, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Both people had happy &quot;endings&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
Story 1<br/>
Elfson (me) &quot;Are you going to haste, &lt;enchanter name&gt;.  If so I will mem a<br/>
new song&quot;<br/>
Chanter &quot;I&#39;ll haste, do you want it?&quot; (What a great enchanter, she knew I<br/>
might be using instruments instead of weapons!)<br/>
Elfson &quot;Nah, I dont think a 40% increase in my kabonging damage will be<br/>
worth the mana&quot;<br/>
Pally &quot;Sing haste song, they stack&quot;<br/>
Elfson (I should have this sentence hotkeyed for how often I say) &quot;There is<br/>
a bard haste song that stacks, but it is a whopping 5% haste, its not worth<br/>
it.  The song icons will both stay on your buff list as the stat bonuses for<br/>
my song will stick, but the haste will not stack&quot;<br/>
Chanter &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure Elf is right&quot; (I love her, she even late defused a<br/>
fight between me and a drewd who trained us, killing me)<br/>
Pally &quot;No my guild (name left out to protect the few people in this parade<br/>
of fools who I like) tested it, they stack&quot;<br/>
&lt;two fights go by, I am playing Cantata(34), Shield of Songs (I can&#39;t decide<br/>
if I like this or Niv&#39;s for when we lack a cleric), and Absonant Binding<br/>
(spelling butchered)&gt;<br/>
Pally &quot;Where is haste song?????&quot; (I may have added a question mark or two,<br/>
heh)<br/>
&lt;3 fights, same song mix, chanter, drewd and I are discussing merit of Rune<br/>
Song vs Regen song, chanter loves rune song, drewd thinks regen would be<br/>
better&gt;<br/>
&lt;by the way, we kicking major butt right now, an uber warrior is pulling 3<br/>
mobs at a time, and we never stop and rest&gt;<br/>
Elfson&#39;s Buddy &lt;via tell&gt; &quot;Got room for a dead sexy rogue and his feet?&quot; (ok<br/>
my friends are weird...)<br/>
Elfson &lt;via reply&gt; &quot;Not yet, let me see if anyone is leaving soon&quot;<br/>
Pally &quot;PLAY HASTE SONG!!!!&quot;<br/>
&lt;target pally&gt;<br/>
&lt;disband pally&gt;<br/>
God I love being leader...<br/>
Elfson &quot;Sorry I had to do that, if you guys want I will disband and you can<br/>
reform with him&quot;<br/>
Other 3 group members &lt;paraphrase&gt; &quot;No that ok, we&#39;ll stay, should we look<br/>
for a 6th?&quot;<br/>
&lt;necro was Japanese I think, never said 3 words in the 2 hours he was<br/>
grouped&gt;<br/>
Elfson &quot;I know a rogue with some sexy feet who wants in, think we&#39;ll be ok<br/>
with no back up heal?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Story 2<br/>
Drewd &lt;different from above drewd, only the warrior is the same&gt; &quot;LOM, play<br/>
mana song&quot;<br/>
Elfson &quot;Been going since fight ended&quot;<br/>
&lt;pause&gt;<br/>
Drewd &quot;I dont see it on my screen&quot;<br/>
Elfson &quot;It doesnt have an icon&quot;<br/>
Drewd &quot;Then why am I still LOM?&quot;<br/>
&lt;I get up and make sure she was in area of spell&gt;<br/>
Elfson &quot;You&#39;re getting mana song, make sure you med close to the group, its<br/>
a small song.&quot;<br/>
&lt;fight&gt;<br/>
Drewd &quot;Play mana song!&quot;<br/>
UberWarrior (who&#39;s primary I was on a 10 hour raid with the day before) &quot;See<br/>
those little blue sparkles?  Thats mana song!&quot;<br/>
(I think at this point Uber Warrior lost it, he had been drumbling about the<br/>
drewd for a time)<br/>
UberWarrior &quot;For once, I&#39;m in a decent group in Karnors, and I have to<br/>
listen a PhatlewtDrood complain about one of the few bards I&#39;ve seen on this<br/>
server who actually know what the hell they&#39;re doing!  Shut the hell up!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it was nice to some other people tired of clueless players telling<br/>
bards what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Alsi it was a fun weekend for me.  Got to raid CHardok (5 kings, 3 Queens),<br/>
then took a group of lower lvl guildies to Kaesora to get xp while a Ranger<br/>
and I got our keys.  Of course some idiot warrior looted my fang... Grr.....<br/>
But all in all it was fun...</div>
