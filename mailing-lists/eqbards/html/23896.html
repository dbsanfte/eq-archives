<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488949251">I think that bards are probably over powered in the pre 50 game and under<br/>
powered in the post 50 game.<br/>
<br/>
I see absolutely nothing in this patch that addresses EITHER of those<br/>
beliefs. Furthermore, assuming that my personal belief is incorrect, I see<br/>
nothing that does the opposite. Based on what I see in this patch, I have to<br/>
conclude that bards are perfect and all the other classes are being balanced<br/>
to match them, only I&#39;m not seeing any reduction of power in the other<br/>
classes post 50, in fact, I&#39;m seeing modest improvements for them.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m so disappointed it hurts. Why bother trying to &quot;balance&quot; the classes if<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re going to fall so short.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why bother trying to discuss class balance if you&#39;re not going to even look<br/>
at the possibility<br/>
that bards are overpowered already?  And if you won&#39;t accept that if bards<br/>
are currently overpowered<br/>
compared to other classes as a whole that they won&#39;t get major improvements<br/>
while some other<br/>
classes will, then I predict you are about to be even more disappointed.<br/>
