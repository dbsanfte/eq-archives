<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719437967"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes I did notice, sorry to only notice the bad things ;-) force of habit.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;also liked this one (potentially adds a bit more depth IMHO):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:o) Well *I* only appear to notice mails still in the window of my email<br/>
client, which is why I reposted the whole freakin thing *apologizes to<br/>
everyone checking email with a 2400 baud modem*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not exactly sure what it means but I think it means there are a couple<br/>
&gt;of new spell icons so every dang buff doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, I hope<br/>
&gt;so anyway.  Not necessary but a welcomed addition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, it is a pain having to play a song and right click on it to see if<br/>
it&#39;s Psalm or Guardian Rhythms...makes it hard to set up banks...I hope this<br/>
helps solve it.<br/>
