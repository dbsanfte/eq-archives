<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853939880">Sort of a sidebar to our bard loot whines (kidding!  I whine about our loot<br/>
priority too sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
On another Trak raid yesterday (gotta love patches the day AFTER you kill<br/>
him, everyone is camped out nearby with their poison gear), a froglok<br/>
croaking dirk drops. 10/18 small amount of ac, agi, cha and mr.  And its<br/>
awarded to me.  I need to ask our guild leader why me, but I guess he gives<br/>
priority to people who are always there (I have been to all of our 6? Trak<br/>
raids now), cause I cant imagine no one else there asked for it.  (Though it<br/>
peircing so maybe he only considered rouges and bards eligible)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, now I suddenly feel my melee dam could become meaningful, so I think<br/>
I need to get meself a hast item.  Is there really any other option than<br/>
buying a FBSS?  I have about 8k now, so I am close to its going price...<br/>
