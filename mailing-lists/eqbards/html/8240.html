&gt; &gt; That&#39;s been an interesting topic among the developers here at work.<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; had a different take from everyone else on the proliferation of No Drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; items.  There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of<br/>
&gt; &gt; items<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.<br/>
&gt; &gt; By<br/>
&gt; &gt; making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game<br/>
&gt; objects<br/>
&gt; &gt; down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 	Kitasi<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The problem with that theory is that there&#39;s only such much any one<br/>
&gt; person can keep.  8 characters x 8 bank slots x 10 backpack slots = 6400<br/>
&gt; items, plus the items on the 8 characters, per account, per shard.  Of<br/>
&gt; course this is exluding stackable items, but light-stones aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stackable.<br/>
&gt; Stackable items can only increase this by 20 fold, assuming that<br/>
&gt; everything<br/>
&gt; you owned was stackable.<br/>
