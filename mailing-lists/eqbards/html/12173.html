<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283175052">Ya I felt that way at your age too but boy was I wrong.  Turns out what I<br/>
did not like was bad groups - dungeons make them worse.  Also did not like<br/>
trains - but that&#39;s not surprizing.  <br/>
<br/>
Get a good group going - or join a good guild and dungeons can be really<br/>
fun. And good xp and good loots.<br/>

Mind you, I&#39;m not really partial to dungeons, but<br/>
unfortunately a lot of lambent quest items are in them so I guess I&#39;d better<br/>
start liking them. :)<br/>
