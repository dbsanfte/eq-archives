<br/>
It was good to meet you in game this week.  Thanks for your help.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question, at level 23, perceptually, I was moving faster<br/>
last night than before the patch.<br/>

Perceptually Selo&#39;s is about 30% slower for me (level 50, Selo&#39;s drum) since<br/>
the<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
Another 50th level bard with whom I spoke agreed and said he sent feedback.<br/>
I sent<br/>
feedback and petitioned.  The GM who answered submitted a bug report.  I<br/>
also<br/>
contacted Shada and a few others to ask them if they noticed and to submit<br/>
something<br/>
if they had.<br/>
<br/>
I unfortunately have no hard baseline against which to compare.  Would<br/>
someone who<br/>
does please repeat a test?<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note and to address someone who asked about the minotaur hero:<br/>
I<br/>
completed the quest last night.  When I arrived in Steamfont a druid<br/>
gentleman was<br/>
waiting for the hero and said he had been there 4 hours and missed the one<br/>
spawn<br/>
when he left briefly.  He soon logged and I was very fortunate because the<br/>
hero<br/>
spwaned when I had been there less than an hour.  So that is two heroes in<br/>
about 5<br/>
hours.  I know people were camping Meldrath and I was killing minos in the<br/>
maze for<br/>
something to do and with slight hope it would help.  Perhaps I was just very<br/>
very<br/>
lucky; perhaps killing the minos did help.  Either way I am very pleased =).<br/>
<br/>
Oh one other thing: GrimFeather drops lambent stones, did you know?<br/>
