<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919303122">Being a newly 32nd bard I&#39;m getting hit with various questions and claims<br/>
regarding my 32nd level Clarity song.  I have read previously on this list<br/>
that our song does stack with an Enchanter&#39;s Clarity spell.  Does anyone<br/>
have hard number with what percentage increase there is?  Is it in fact<br/>
Enchanter Clarity + Bard Clarity?  The one thing that I&#39;ve been told that I<br/>
had no previous knowledge of is that Bard Clarity stacks with Bard Clarity.<br/>
Is this so?  If so, is it Bard Clarity + Bard Clarity, or a lesser<br/>
percentage of increase.  What about three or more bards in a group, etc.?<br/>
