peopel get tired of camping the trainer with the 800 other people on the<br/>
hill. I sold mine to a paladin with appearantly far to much money that<br/>
offered me 45 for it.. I wasn&#39;t planning on selling it at the time.. but<br/>
hell.. for 45p.. I was all over it.. Bought a new one shortly after that for<br/>

&gt; ...and now what?  I want to trade it in for something better but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know what.  I&#39;m a lvl 11 bard with a mino axe, and an almost complete<br/>
&gt; leather setup (which suggests rightly that I am dirt poor).  I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; if I should sell it for coin (what is the usual ceiling on these? 25 pp?)<br/>
&gt; or try trading it for a better weapon (the Dirk seems like a popular<br/>
&gt; choice), or even try trading it for banded (how many pieces?).  It seems<br/>
&gt; more logical that I would get a better price in a far off city from<br/>
&gt; Crushbone like Freeport or even Qeynos but can someone confirm? So I throw<br/>
&gt; this question to the masses..<br/>
