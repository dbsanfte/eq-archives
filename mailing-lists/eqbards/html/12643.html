<div id="ygrps-yiv-470520607">many people carry both at all times.  others will bank on the way and get<br/>
the gear for only one dragon, because though we can easily do them both, we<br/>
usually make an agreement with another guild on who is doing which, because<br/>
there will undoubtedly be simultaneous raids on each dragon within minutes<br/>
after a server crash, patch, or they normally spawn.  and even though last<br/>
couple times we finished our dragon about 5 hours before they finished (or<br/>
gave up) on theirs, we don&#39;t just barge in and take over.  and same here of<br/>
course, we clear everything to the dragon, then we rebuff, put on gear, med<br/>
up, and charge.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I can&#39;t speak for how things are done on Mithaniel Marr, but <br/>
&gt; when we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; planning on doing both dragons, we bring along both sets of <br/>
&gt; gear so that we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need to stop at a bank in between.<br/>
&gt; Also, nobody puts on resist gear until we&#39;re fighting the <br/>
&gt; dragon itself, so<br/>
&gt; a glance early on won&#39;t tell you what gear people brought with them.<br/>
