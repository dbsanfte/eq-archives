<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479327358">The power curves discuss the ability of the Bard to do damage.  This mean DOTs, DDs, and melee.  When<br/>
melee doesn&#39;t increase in proportion to the pure melee classes (which it demonstrably does not), then to<br/>
be balanced, casting should increase in power MORE than pure casters increase in power, which it<br/>
demonstrably does not.  So unless you want to contend that the OTHER things we get along the way more than<br/>
make up for the shortfall, we&#39;re not balanced.  What exactly is the point of singing DD or DOT songs if<br/>
they do 20% more damage at 60 as they do at 50, when casters do double?  (And, in fact, our songs do less,<br/>
since MOB resists are higher).<br/>
<br/>
The reason that it&#39;s reasonable to look at damage separately is that we do not have the ability to do<br/>
everything at once.  If we choose to do damage, that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.  If damage doesn&#39;t scale up and<br/>
other things do, then it&#39;s pointless for us to be doing damage; we should be doing something else.  That&#39;s<br/>
severely limiting, and essentially means that we do not have a significant part of the flexibility that<br/>
we&#39;re designed to have (and that Verant believes we have when determining how &quot;balanced&quot; we are).  If<br/>
damage doesn&#39;t scale up and other things don&#39;t either, then by definition we&#39;re not balanced.<br/>
<br/>
Caster power increases in 4 ways as they level up:<br/>
1.  They get increased mana regen, which allows them to cast more spells in a given amount of time.<br/>
2.  Their replacement spells have increased durations, which require them to cast fewer spells to maintain<br/>
the same effect, freeing up mana for other purposes.<br/>
3.  Their replacement spells have greater apparent effect (for example, they do more direct damage when<br/>
successful, or they add more strength).<br/>
4.  Their replacement spells become more mana efficient.<br/>
<br/>
All of our songs miss out on #1.  Our limiting factor is time, and time does not go faster the higher we<br/>
level.<br/>
All of our songs miss out on #2.  All of our songs have the same duration no matter what our level.<br/>
All of our songs miss out on #4.  Same constraint as #1, we can only have x effects in play at one time.<br/>
<br/>
This means that the ONLY way to balance our songs is for our effect to become greater.  And in order to<br/>
make up for all of the ways in which caster power increase, the effects should become greater FASTER than<br/>
caster spell effects do.    I don&#39;t believe that they do.<br/>

&gt; the problem that people don&#39;t realize is that the bard pretty much increases the<br/>
&gt; effectivity of other people in his/her party.  if our increases also went exponentially<br/>
