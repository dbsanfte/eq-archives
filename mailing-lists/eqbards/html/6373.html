&gt;<br/>
&gt;Camp at graveyard waiting for trains coming from the secret door (I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;been there this is all blind talk based on suggestions) when the train<br/>

&gt;My question for folks who have done it is, in your opinion, do we stand a<br/>
&gt;chance at ALL? Hints, suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
Sounds is as good a strategy as any... If you wait at the zone for trains<br/>
you have 2 advantages and 1 disadvantage....<br/>
<br/>
Some times people will hang out there to try and pick mobs off trains, so<br/>
you&#39;ll have some help (and some competition).<br/>
You&#39;ll be close to the zone line so if someone gets worked, they can escape<br/>
while the party still might have a chance.<br/>
<br/>
But, you will also most likely have more mobs in the train at that point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion... If you do this method, do not stop to loot.  Anyone looting<br/>
will be run over before they can pick up the item.  Enlist the help of<br/>
someone who&#39;s job is to just stand invisible, wait for the mob to die, and<br/>
the train to move off.  Then, they can loot without any fear of dying.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you all will be run over very fast by these trains.  Trains that<br/>
include Mythi are bad.... Very very bad.  You&#39;re looking at several 30+ mobs<br/>
as well as some under 30 mobs.  You might have to try this a few times<br/>
before getting it down, and then I think it&#39;ll be luck that helps you.  I<br/>
think you&#39;re better off going when it&#39;s crowded... Less mobs in train path<br/>
to be picked up.  More chances of trains (as people get bored and get over<br/>
their heads fast and easy)<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions all based on my experiences... Your milage may vary.  : )<br/>
<br/>
I left MM a few days ago after 3 deaths in 2 hours and proceeded to die 4<br/>
times in an hour in Permafrost.  I went from a hair from 26 down to 3<br/>
bubbles away.  What luck.  : )<br/>
