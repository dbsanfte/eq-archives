<br/>
I was away yesterday, and missed this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Slyde - I did kinda change guilds. Excalibur is a great guild, <br/>
&gt; but just never able to field enough folks of a similiar level <br/>
&gt; to go do anything. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think guild size is hitting a few of us. Dragon&#39;s Claw has always <br/>
been &quot;almost there&quot;, but we have always had to pull in a few friends <br/>
for the larger kills -- VS, Char Royalty, etc... We were lucky enough <br/>
to find another guild -- League of Gallantry -- who share DC&#39;s goals <br/>
and vision, and who were looking to become a bit larger. Tonight is <br/>
the official merger of the two guilds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Darkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to<br/>
&gt; South and hopefully a bard mask. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must have missed this... what Bard mask?<br/>
<br/>
Brilinnia: Grats on the BP!<br/>
Slyde: 54 is bad, but I am sure you will be 55 soon enough.<br/>
Darkfox: Good to actually spend a few minutes talking to you face-to-<br/>
face over the weekend. I think that is the first time I have ever <br/>
talked to you when I could see you. *Grins*<br/>
<br/>
As for the silly Wizard porting your group on accident, our last trip <br/>
into HS was also interrupted by a wizard hitting the wrong spell and <br/>
porting his group out. Although the worst miscast spell I have <br/>
witnessed in there was about two weeks ago -- a druid friend and I <br/>
thought we would get some exp and go solo the entrance to HS (we <br/>
have &quot;broken&quot; it before waiting for others to arrive.) Anway, she <br/>
gets HTed by a new spawn and goes to heal herself... the next thing I <br/>
know she is dead! Seems she accidentially DDed herself (talk about a <br/>
bad time not to resist. *Smiles*) So... there I am, stuck with two <br/>
MOBs and no help. All I can say is thank Erollisi for SoT and Thurg <br/>
gate potions. *Grins*</div>
