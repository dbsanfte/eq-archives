<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s been so long that I&#39;m not sure how accurate this is, but since I was a<br/>
&gt; hardcore solo bard, here&#39;s what I can remember:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 20-23 (not exactly sure) Gargoyles in Ocean of Tears<br/>
&gt; Level 27 - Cyclopses in Rathe Mtns<br/>
&gt; Level 30 - Hill Giants in Rathe Mtns<br/>
&gt; Level 35 - Bloodgills in Lake of Ill Omen (best to have a tambourine by <br/>
&gt; this time and a fishbone earring)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gargoyles in OOT<br/>
&gt; I was able to use all instrument combo to bring it down pretty low (Chords <br/>
&gt; of Dissonance, Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, Hymn of Restoration - swap brass<br/>
&gt; and lute appropriately) and when it got me too low, I would bellow kite <br/>
&gt; using 2 bellows and accelerando. This was pretty hard, so I would only <br/>
&gt; recommend this for someone who is a great kiter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great...this is just the kind of info I&#39;m looking for. I take it you don&#39;t<br/>
remember lower than 20?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Been playing DAOC and believe me, as a Hibernian Bard you can always find a<br/>
&gt; group (I mean, heck, we can ressurect after level 10!).<br/>
