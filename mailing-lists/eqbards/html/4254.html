<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020975707"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>
&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know we<br/>
&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>
&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we both<br/>
<br/>
&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.  No<br/>
&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>
&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>
&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>
&gt; to run. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He hangs out regularly in an inn in (and out and out!) highpass. Open the<br/>
wrong door and well, lets just say you&#39;ll learn to knock first. <br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a certain quest in the area.. after completing a section of<br/>
quest, he usually attacks you as you leave.<br/>
<br/>
If he was out there, someone probably trained him.<br/>
<br/>
He IS very difficult. I, buffed up and ready, opened his door (with my<br/>
level 30 druid). Boom, HT, down to 40% life, whackwhack, down to 30%.<br/>
GATE!!! interrupted. down to 20%. GATE! down to 10% down to to a sliver I<br/>
can&#39;t see.. You resume concentration and continue casting. LOADING, PLEASE<br/>
WAIT.<br/>
<br/>
*phew* When I appeared in everfrost (my bind point) I had 5hp and several<br/>
DOTs on me. I was ready though and cast my fastest heal before I died.<br/>
<br/>
Probably would have gone a LOT better if I had had a tank with me. Because<br/>
of that HT, I had no time to use ANY of my mana, excluding for the gate.<br/>
