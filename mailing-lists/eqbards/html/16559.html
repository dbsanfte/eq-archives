&gt; &gt; On the one hand, you claim you almost never use chain,<br/>

&gt; &gt; about how reliable chain is against high level mobs.  Do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; see the credibility problem here?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Credibility MY ASS!  You really think I always have a druid or ranger in the<br/>
&gt; party?  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been relegated to the role of<br/>
&gt; stopping runners.  The only person who has any credibility in this<br/>
&gt; discussion is the one who has had to use chains as the parties ONLY means of<br/>
&gt; stopping runners AND has seen the other side with a druid or ranger doing<br/>
&gt; their job.  If there is a credibility question perhaps it is you since you<br/>
&gt; always party with a druid... Try without one sometime.  It gives you a whole<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Who said I always party with a druid?  Most of my time is<br/>
spent with clerics, paladins, rogues, and warriors.  I&#39;ve<br/>
deferred to rangers/druids doing snare and been horrified at<br/>
the increased damage our party takes.  If there are two<br/>
snarers, I will drop Chain for Binding and make sure both<br/>
snarers realize I no longer have Chain memorized.  But if<br/>
there&#39;s only one snarer, I keep Chain and arrange to have the<br/>
snarer snare when I tell them Chain is off.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, perhaps because I&#39;m 5 levels lower then you are I&#39;m just stupid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Look, there must be something else going on here because<br/>
except for the situations I&#39;ve outlined (very high blues and<br/>
higher, magic resist buffs), I pretty much haven&#39;t had a<br/>
problem with Chain.  At least two other high level bards have<br/>
posted pretty much agreeing with me.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to have taken the credibility remark the wrong way.  <br/>
I apologize for that.  I spent a few minutes trying to think<br/>
of the right word, and &quot;credibility&quot; was the closest I could<br/>
come up with.  What I was trying to convey was, if you don&#39;t<br/>
believe Chain is that reliable, then you are more apt to give<br/>
up using it and defer to snarers.  That will color your<br/>
experience since you&#39;ll have fewer incidents where Chain was<br/>
the primary means of runner control, snarer or no snarer.  In<br/>
no way did I mean it as a criticism of your character.  Again,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you took it the wrong way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And I&#39;ve had it wear off immediately from a L2 beetle.  It<br/>

&gt; &gt; it works fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to see a log analysis here.  In my experience its more liek 40% to<br/>
&gt; 50%...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, Chain wearing off does not generate a message,<br/>
so it won&#39;t show up in a logfile.  All I can say is that<br/>
except for the exceptions I listed, a mob I&#39;m chaining being<br/>
able to run consistently enough to cause problems is the rare<br/>
exception, not the rule.<br/>

&gt; &gt; area for some reason (probably so set into the camp mentality<br/>
&gt; &gt; that having to run around confusing corridors is terrifying<br/>
&gt; &gt; for them).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Live side on Prexus is just as camped as the dead side...  Got about as much<br/>
&gt; chance getting to see the evil eye or crusader as you do getting in a lord<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The eye and crusader are outside the maze, and thus heavily<br/>
camped.  My friends and I have spent a lot of time in LGuk<br/>
lately on Karana, and the only time I have problems finding<br/>
stuff to pull is when the king, noble, elder, and patriarch<br/>
are *all* camped.  Heck, I practically gained half my<br/>
experience in 48 soloing there during peak hours.<br/>
