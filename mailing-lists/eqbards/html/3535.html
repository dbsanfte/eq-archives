5pp to 10pp. They are found on the island of the Sisters of Erollisi. On this<br/>
island are warriors just named &quot;a sister of erollisi&quot; that carry a rusty halberd<br/>

Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am on a mission today for STR increasing items (my base STR is 75 eeeuoo).  I<br/>
have heard people like Shada talk about a purity belt.  What is it, how much is<br/>
it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides rubicite, is there<br/>
another armor that has the very high AC and yet is light?  Is mesh an option for<br/>
bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  I&#39;ve heard many Looking to buy&#39;s but I<br/>
don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone wearing it.<br/>
<br/>
And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON EROLLISI MARR!!!!!  I<br/>
saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a full suit of bronze<br/>
plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it to him, nice gift.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started about 3 days ago.<br/>
No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport gates than some lvl 20+<br/>
came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he wanted a 2H instead and then<br/>
waved and ran off almost before I could tell him how to say thank you.<br/>
<br/>
So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess I&#39;m just bent<br/>
because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly so there&#39;s no way I<br/>
could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>
