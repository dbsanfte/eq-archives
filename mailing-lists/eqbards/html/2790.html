<div id="ygrps-yiv-123603572">I have one note to add about the silk quest. I completed this quest early on in<br/>
the game multiple times.  Enough times to not fight one battle between levels 3<br/>
and 7.  The money used to be amazing as well, selling the drum after every<br/>
trip.  Many others caught on to the quest and silks became scarce.  Oh well,<br/>
there shouldn&#39;t be many people doing the quest any more, so go earn some money<br/>
and wipe out the spiderling silk vendors across feydwar.<br/>

&gt; Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts? I completed the string quest at the<br/>
&gt; qeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits and a litle bit<br/>
&gt; of exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low level ( at +- 7<br/>
&gt; ), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s and the drum, my<br/>
&gt; shadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think) was very jealous,<br/>
&gt; he walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport :)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for most quests is,<br/>
&gt; because walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not worth it.<br/>
&gt; And getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>
