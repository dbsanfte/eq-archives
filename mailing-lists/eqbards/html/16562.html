<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-351847994">&quot;If you made the chains decision with a ranger or druid in a pick up group<br/>
from my server and forget ever being invited on<br/>
a raid or dungeon crawl again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a sad thing.  My problem is having to turn the raids down (seems most<br/>
folks are on the West Coast, which doesn&#39;t work out well for me on the East<br/>
Coast), and I&#39;ve Chained since level 23.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A lot of times our method for dealing with runners when snare fails these<br/>
days is a BIG blast from our nuker and a BIG<br/>
dot from our shaman...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A spell can be resisted either way, regardless of whether it&#39;s Chains or Ice<br/>
Comet.  There&#39;s still some chance the runner will get away.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I also don&#39;t always have chains loaded... even for backup.  [...]  Thanks<br/>
god the other bard had chains :).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly :).  I&#39;m &quot;the other bard.&quot;  (Not literally)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe here I&#39;m a bit spoiled also since my guild is primarily shamans and<br/>
slowing MOBs down usually only becomes my job on super high magic resist<br/>
mobs like Ogre Guards.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh, you are.  Hug your shammies, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re appreciated enough,<br/>
especially with the whole stats fiasco going on right now.  Again, if I have<br/>
both a snarer and an attack speed debuffer in the group, I can find<br/>
something better than Chains to play for that 3rd twist.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What level mobs are you fighting?  In my experience it is a rule, not<br/>
exception... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bats, LDC&#39;s, dars, boks, etc.  The standard Sol B/LGuk mix.  My unbuffed CHA<br/>
is 121 (I always carry more CHA equip, but mainly just wear it for Lament<br/>
breakins).  Dex is about 120 unbuffed.  I&#39;ve used Chains in all the dungeons<br/>
except Kedge (keep meaning to visit that place), and haven&#39;t had many<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oggok bouncers, specs, giants, etc... you simply don&#39;t need to stop these<br/>
things as they really don&#39;t run far and if they do,<br/>
so what. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aye, outdoors, I LOVE snare + Screech, because runners are no big deal, and<br/>
if I&#39;m using weapons, I get to be lazy and just leave one song playing<br/>
(Screech).  Once you hit 48, though, it&#39;s Screech + CoC + Screech + CoD...<br/>
sigh, no rest for the weary.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I still say that you are asking for trouble with pixie, charm or chains in<br/>
places like Paw or Sol A...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;ve done all three in Sol A and Paw.  Of course, when I was in<br/>
Paw, I pulled to a relatively safe spot deeper down in the dungeon than most<br/>
people go.  It was much safer there, since the only trains were my own, and<br/>
smart pulling avoids trains.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think you would disagree with my assessment of chains on things<br/>
like Efreeti raids or dungeon crawls though :).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nope, I agree with you -- you generally have 12+ people for those, always a<br/>
snarer and an attack speed debuffer.  No need for chains when you have both<br/>
of those present.  But I still keep it memmed.  Besides, Screech with Fire<br/>
Giants is much more fun. ;p<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hmmm, I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to fight for XP in lower<br/>
Guk&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh, those were the days.  Hopefully the expansion pack will relieve some of<br/>
the crowding down there.  Live side isn&#39;t nearly as camped as dead side,<br/>
though.  I went back to my old hangouts the other night, just to see if<br/>
crowding had affected them yet (got my ego busted when I finished the two<br/>
minos in the Patriarch room and only had a bubble of health left, even after<br/>
doing some mez/healing when I was down to one).<br/>
