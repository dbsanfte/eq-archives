<b>Subject:</b> On practicing songs and politeness <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013652239">Was in Cazic last night.  There was a very annoying bard there<br/>
(level 26, twinked with rubicite, staff of writhing, etc) who<br/>
decided he&#39;d practice his brass skill.  First it took him<br/>
about 100 tries to start it up.  Each failure was accompanied<br/>
by the &quot;starts an song&quot; and &quot;misses a note&quot; messages - two<br/>
lines coming about 4 times a second.  It scrolled all messages<br/>
off everyone&#39;s screens and our group simply could not<br/>
communicate with each other.  He kept this up for a good half<br/>
minute, and gave repeat performances every time he decided to<br/>
switch a song.<br/>
<br/>
When he finally did get his song started, it was the Screech.<br/>
He managed to chase the lizards we and everyone else were<br/>
fighting away.  He also tried Discord, which generates one<br/>
line of spam every tick.  This wasn&#39;t a problem for him though<br/>
because we were in the courtyard, and if a train got started<br/>
on him, the zone was just 10 seconds away.<br/>
<br/>
Please folks, realize that some of our songs can be very<br/>
annoying both in terms of spam and graphics lag (especially if<br/>
you&#39;re L24 or over) for other people.  I practiced my brass<br/>
skill in Crushbone (when others weren&#39;t around) and fighting<br/>
aqua goblins in the Cauldron, where I was almost always alone<br/>
(though a few people decided I &quot;needed&quot; help when they saw me<br/>
at the entrance to Unrest seemingly not fighting while these<br/>
goblins were beating up on me).<br/>
