<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704871484">ok i agree with this entire thread regarding songs vs melee in regards to<br/>
damage, i know how our songs work after 56 levels (riposte is at 57 by the<br/>
way).  however, i do melee pretty much 100% of the time, and i completely<br/>
disagree with the exaggeration of how close we are in melee ability to<br/>
casters.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;barely a notch above shaman and druids&quot;<br/>
&quot;not far beyond those of some of the &quot;pure&quot; casters&quot;<br/>
&quot;pathetic&quot;<br/>
&quot;horrendously behind the power curve&quot;<br/>
&quot;pretty much the same [as casters]&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ok we&#39;re going too far here.  no bards are not tanks, we don&#39;t have near the<br/>
defensive or offensive capabilities of the melee classes or hybrids, but we<br/>
are not nearly as close to the priests (you keep saying pure casters, i<br/>
assume you mean priests only, if you think we are close to the pure casters<br/>
in melee ability i would be speechless).  sure i would say we are somewhere<br/>
in between.  if you want to do damage as a bard at high levels, as opposed<br/>
to group buffing, you are going to be using weapons.  you are not going to<br/>
be using our AoE damage songs in dungeons.  z-axis fixed or not (i say it&#39;s<br/>
still not), you do not want multiple mobs on you, let alone if you have an<br/>
enchanter in your group.  the 3 chants are nice until they are resisted too<br/>
much, as well as the fact that you are not doing anything else for the group<br/>
when you are weaving these 3 songs (i&#39;d say most of us can not weave more<br/>
than 3 songs).<br/>
<br/>
i am not singing damage songs, i am helping my group.  i am giving them<br/>
haste, mana, charming, resists, etc. in every fight.  do songs outdamage our<br/>
weapons?  yes.  can you use them to be the most effective bard?  no.  what<br/>
are you left with if you feel the need to do damage?  your weapons.  sure i<br/>
have some good stuff (RBB+VoV with a breath of harmony and symphonic saber)<br/>
but even on average you are telling me i am barely out-meleeing a priest<br/>
against a mob?  or for that matter, that if i stand up to a priest with no<br/>
songs for me and no spells for them, i can&#39;t out-melee him?  put a bad ass<br/>
2h weapon into a priest&#39;s hands, and hear them miss after miss.  put 2 fast<br/>
high-ratio weapons into a bard&#39;s hands and i think you see more than a<br/>
slight difference.  no i did not say we are tanks, not even remotely close.<br/>
i am saying we are better at melee than you think, or at least a bit better<br/>
than you think we are compared to priests.<br/>
