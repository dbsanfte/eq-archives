&gt; &gt; My husband is an enchanter, and quite a good one. Any of the AE songs<br/>
(CoD,<br/>

&gt; Largo&#39;s does not wake up mobs from an enchanter&#39;s mez/thrall, damage is<br/>
&gt; required (or something overriding it that doesn&#39;t stack, e.g. lullaby).<br/>

okay. Good to know. I havn&#39;t used that particular one (Largo&#39;s) as much -<br/>
but i do know that most AE songs tend to have the added &quot;quality&quot; of<br/>
attracting multiple mobs that you don&#39;t necessarily want to pull to your<br/>
group. That&#39;s another reason to be careful what you sing... and where you<br/>
sing it.<br/>
<br/>
Btw... on a side note... I really appreciate all you people posting to this<br/>
list - I learn a lot every day from it and have been adding tactics talked<br/>
about here to my arsinal of strategies. Thank you everyone!!<br/>
