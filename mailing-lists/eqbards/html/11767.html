&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, you are looking at this as a competition. So what if it&#39;s crowded? I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hunt what I can, when I can - if someone else gets it, oh well. Mobs are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; somewhere else to hunt.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is self-contradictory.  On the one hand, you say &quot;so what<br/>
&gt; &gt;if it&#39;s crowded?&quot;  On the other you say if it&#39;s too crowded,<br/>
&gt; &gt;you just logout.  If your attitude towards it is &quot;so what,&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is a condition - while a problem - it is not one attributable to PEOPLE. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My biggest problem with too many folks in an area isn&#39;t nothing to hunt -<br/>
&gt; or having to grab a mob before someone else does - it&#39;s simply a matter of<br/>
&gt; lag. Lag is based (for me at least) solely on the amount of activity going<br/>
&gt; on and mobiles (including players) in an area. I don&#39;t consider this a<br/>
&gt; matter of competition - it&#39;s just a fact given the current state of<br/>
&gt; technology and primarily my connection. It has nadda to do with who is<br/>
&gt; there - obviously if a zone is so crowded I constantly crash - or can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; move - that IS a problem - but not something I attribute to other people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me cut to the chase:  If you were in a zone with nothing<br/>
to hunt, would you continue playing?  Would most people<br/>
continue playing?<br/>
<br/>
Now, if so many people/people of enough capability are in the<br/>
zone so that there is practically nothing to hunt, would your<br/>
answer be different?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can claim it&#39;s not attributable to people<br/>
when everything else is the same and the only differing factor<br/>
is people.  True, they are not deliberately and directly<br/>
preventing you from finding anything to hunt, but they are<br/>
doing it indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you don&#39;t care about finding mobs to kill, then I can<br/>
see why you feel the way you do.  But I hardly think that&#39;s<br/>
representative of the majority of the playerbase.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They have as much right to be there as I do, while I could think of several<br/>
&gt; ways to handle this a bit better - I don&#39;t blame it on other folks - and<br/>
&gt; what they may or may not have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why are you putting an ethical spin on this?  Their reasons<br/>
for doing what they do are irrelevant (aside from how it<br/>
relates to their enjoyment of the game).  If there are too<br/>
many people playing the game as it was meant to be played, it<br/>
has a negative impact on overall player enjoyment.  There&#39;s no<br/>
ill will or malicious intent behind that, it&#39;s just the way it<br/>
is - supply falls short of demand so the public grows<br/>
discontent.  Given that inescapable fact, how do you best<br/>
design the game to mitigate this reduction in enjoyment?<br/>
