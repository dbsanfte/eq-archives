compared the two I hear SS is slower. Draw your own conclusions though. Try <br/>
that test that John posted maybe. I tend to not believe everything I <br/>
see/hear/read unless I see evidence myself, so to me it&#39;s still up in the <br/>
air. Personally I&#39;ll probly give my rogue my FBSS and get a TBB until I can <br/>

I don&#39;t ask for it (which I never do, actually).<br/>

&gt;I am curious as to how the Swirlspine Belt figures into all this.<br/>
&gt;I have heard rumors that it is both faster than, the same, and slower<br/>
&gt;than the FBSS.  Anyone have one they could try out?  If it is indeed<br/>
&gt;the same haste %, then by far it is better than the FBSS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is interesting, I have a monk friend who has some Cape off of<br/>
&gt;Innoruuk that gives what he says is 30% haste, he might be interested<br/>
&gt;to know that my lil&#39; old Verses of Celerity might indeed give him<br/>
&gt;maximum haste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wonder how monk attacks like Dragon Punch and Flying Kick, and also<br/>
&gt;Backstab figure into the equation.<br/>
