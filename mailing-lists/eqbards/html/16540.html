I&#39;ve been getting from casters I&#39;m grouped with, it seems the<br/>
per-level improvement of bard Clarity far outpaces the<br/>
per-level improvement of enchanter Clairty.  If the mana regen<br/>
speedup is what I think it is, at level 60 bard Clarity will<br/>
regen mana roughly twice as fast as the current enchanter<br/>
Clarity at L60.  They are due for an upgrade.<br/>
