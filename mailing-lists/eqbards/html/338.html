<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020962230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The<br/>
&gt;complaining about everything under the sun was a little misdirected,<br/>
&gt;however.  Like the majority of my post said, I am happy with Verant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry Gabriel, the closing remark was not directed at you. I <br/>
misplaced an expression of my frustration with all of the posts <br/>
trashing Verant, trashing the Soerbairds, trashing individual <br/>
posters, and everything else under the sun. Nearly all of it totally <br/>
misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO EQ is the most awesome online game I have ever encountered and I <br/>
am appalled at how people will whine even when a company is as <br/>
responsive to it&#39;s customer&#39;s concerns as Verant has been so far. I <br/>
played Meridian 59 for years at 3 times the cost and 3DO was totally <br/>
UNresponsive to it&#39;s customers concerns. The UO staff was nearly as <br/>
bad. <br/>
<br/>
Gee, I am sorry that I&#39;m not following the crowd, but I actually <br/>
appreciate Verant. (Again, these comments are not directed at you, <br/>
Gabriel, you seem have a good head on your shoulders)  :0)<br/>
