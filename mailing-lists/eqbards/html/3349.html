<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117333676">I have a dilemma :)  Last night I purchased (for 200 plat) an Obsidian Shard <br/>
(6 Dam/25 delay, Obsidian Shatter effect).  I had thought I had read the the <br/>
OS effect did 75 damage, but I only proc&#39;d once last night for 30. The <br/>
effect is very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Now the dilemma.  A rogue offered me a Polished Granite Tomahawk and a <br/>
Dragoon Dirk for the Shard.  Now personally I am leaning toward keeping the <br/>
Shard, but I know I could barter the PGT into either a good bit of plat <br/>
(saving for steel plate) or a nice item or two.  Any and all advise is <br/>
welcome....<br/>
