<div id="ygrps-yiv-839204841">Well, the other class I haven&#39;t played is a magician, mostly due to<br/>
the incredibly bad experiences I&#39;ve had every time I&#39;ve been near one.<br/>
Fortunately those times have been rare, but inevitably every time I&#39;ve<br/>
joined a group with one, it appears to me as if they are soloing while<br/>
only notionally grouping (if that makes sense).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing less as a bard lately and more as an enchanter since<br/>
she&#39;s just tons of fun.  However, I&#39;m hoping to recover a little faith<br/>
in my bard because being a total flirt is what I do best, and no<br/>
matter how much I want it, dark elf enchanters just don&#39;t seem big<br/>
flirts to me!  ;-)<br/>

&gt;I do believe that it&#39;s a shadowknight quest, but haven&#39;t tested it<br/>
&gt;yet! ;-)  That&#39;s one of the two classes I&#39;ve never tried! </span></blockquote></div>
