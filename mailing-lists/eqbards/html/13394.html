<div id="ygrps-yiv-4607613">Well, the Meditate skill is pretty sweet.  Didn&#39;t even have to zone for it<br/>
to work (read somewhere that we would have to zone for it to kick in the<br/>
first time).<br/>
<br/>
Well, technically you zoned in as soon as you logged on.  The patch message<br/>
says that we cannot train on meditate, but can we improve it?  I tried medding<br/>
a bit with the casters, but never got the skill to improve.  Is it capped at<br/>
1?  At any rate, I died (as usual) last night and memming songs was a lot<br/>
quicker.  Huzzah!<br/>

&gt; tidbit... you can no longer consume vast amounts of alcohol.  Once you get<br/>
&gt; to your... uhm... &quot;drunkenness limit&quot;, you now get a message saying &quot;You<br/>
&gt; could not possibly consume more alcohol or get any more intoxicated!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I noticed that even though Verant has finally given bards something we&#39;ve<br/>
really wanted (meditate), that I got in this morning to a full inbox of people<br/>
griping about the fact that we don&#39;t &quot;surf&quot; anymore.  Boo hoo hoo.  It seems<br/>
some people aren&#39;t happy unless they have something to complain about.</div>
