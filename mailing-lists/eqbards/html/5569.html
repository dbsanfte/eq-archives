<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521491201">If anyone has fought Lord Grimrot when he is carrying the Opal<br/>
Scythe, you know how devasting his debuffs and DoTs can be.<br/>
<br/>
Steal Strength<br/>
Heat Blood<br/>
Disease Cloud<br/>
<br/>
Enter Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody... Not only did this song<br/>
cancel the debuffs, but it eliminated the DoTs as well.  This<br/>
song does indeed work as intended as a Party: Cancel Magic<br/>
effect.  It left my Valor, Guard, and Endure Magic untouched.<br/>
<br/>
Very good song to weave when fighting SKs or necros that use<br/>
their dark magic.<br/>
