I want to believe that you are 100% correct.  However, gonna put on the<br/>
devil&#39;s advocate hat here for the sake of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
First:  There is a big difference between the AC of a caster and the AC of<br/>
someone wearing platemail, especially if they are the same level.  The only<br/>
way a caster will have a higher AC over a plate wearing class is if they are<br/>
higher in level and get the benefit of a higher Defense skill rating.  In<br/>
the observations where you have seen casters getting hit for more damage<br/>
than plate wearers, were the casters a lot higher in level or similar in<br/>
level to the plate wearing classes?  If they were a lot higher in level and<br/>
therefore, in theory, had AC values that were close to one another, then the<br/>
fact that the caster was getting hit for more damage than the platemail<br/>
wearer could be attributed to the platemail deflecting part of the blow.  If<br/>
the caster and platemail wearer were similar in levels, I don&#39;t think you<br/>
can compare the two.  The platemail wearer would almost certainly have had a<br/>
higher AC than the caster and therefore shouldn&#39;t have been hit for as much<br/>
damage.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, there have been so many patches since beta who&#39;s to say that changes<br/>
made in beta are still in effect?<br/>
<br/>
I grant that you have a lot more first hand experience than I have (my only<br/>
character is 26th level) and you may be very well correct.  But like I said<br/>
earlier, I haven&#39;t seen an analysis posted anywhere, even on this list, that<br/>
had conclusive evidence that armor type can deflect part of the blow.<br/>
Everything I have read indicates that the only thing that matters is total<br/>
AC.  If you or anyone else knows where an objective analysis with hard data<br/>
is posted on this topic I would like to read it.  <br/>
<br/>

	Well, it is true. Armor TYPE matters. That&#39;s why you see wizards<br/>
taking full <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; dmg when hit alot more than plate-wearers do. That&#39;s why you AVOID getting<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hit at all costs when you are a caster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The patch I spoke of that implemented Armor TYPES (as opposed to just AC) <br/>
&gt; was introduced toward the end of beta 3. An old friend of mine named Tabin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (the person that inspired me to become a bard) was one of a few players<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; was selected to test out the changes with a GM. He was given sets of <br/>
&gt; different armor and attacked monsters so the GM could get an idea of how<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; armor type patch was working The difference was like night and day.<br/>

&gt; &gt;You would expect this to be the case but I don&#39;t think anyone has ever<br/>
&gt; &gt;confirmed it to be true.  This topic has been discussed on many occasions<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt;this list.  As far as I know, no one has been able to determine if AC is <br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;only factor in determining how much damage you receive per hit or if<br/>
&gt; armor<br/>
&gt; &gt;type plays a role (i.e. deflects part of the blow).  Guess the best way<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;test it is to find a monk with the same AC as you and start collecting <br/>
&gt; &gt;data.<br/>
