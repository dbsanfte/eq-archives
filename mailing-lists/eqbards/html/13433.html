<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707587430">Random skill questions...<br/>
<br/>
1)  Am I mistaken, or is it impossible to actually have all of our<br/>
skills set up on buttons?  I have eight ability-only skills now which<br/>
require buttons to use them.  I think I can only set up six at once?<br/>
<br/>
2)  Anyone know the max on Hide and/or Sneak?<br/>
<br/>
3)  What does it mean to have a lower/higher Hide skill level?  It<br/>
*appears* to work perfectly each time.  I hit the button, I disappear.<br/>
Does skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>
the MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>
<br/>
4)  Is there any way to know whether Sneak actually worked or not?<br/>
Other than trying to move and estimating based on your walking speed?<br/>
What does Sneak do?  Is it just a mobile Hide?  Why do we have Hide<br/>
then, when you could Sneak and stand still?<br/>
<br/>
5)  Are they getting rid of Instill Doubt?  Has anyone ever trained a<br/>
point in this skill?<br/>
<br/>
6)  Begging 77 now, never got more than a copper (well, I seem to recall<br/>
having received a silver piece once, but I may be deluded), although I<br/>
now get a copper more than half the time, it seems.  Anyone with a<br/>
higher skill who managed to get more?  In terms of cash received, are<br/>
there &quot;good&quot; begging targets and &quot;bad&quot; begging targets (other than pets<br/>
and ships)?<br/>
