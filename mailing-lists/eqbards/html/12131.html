&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Everyone, please make an attempt to make things simple for <br/>
&gt; people like Uldar <br/>
&gt; &gt; and myself who don&#39;t go on suicide missions in SolB at level 20 or 35, <br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore having no idea what RL (real life) basis you&#39;re using.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   First of all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I will address the &quot;I&#39;m not level 35 yet, I&#39;m only level foo<br/>
&gt;   and I have no idea what you are talking about.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Here it is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You don&#39;t have tracking until L35, so don&#39;t sweat me ;)<br/>
&gt;   Go complain to your significant other because they don&#39;t let you<br/>
&gt;   play the long hours it takes to make that level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Secondly,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you haven&#39;t been to SolB and you are L35, where have you been?<br/>
&gt;   I was in SolB at L32, and the experience is incredible at that<br/>
&gt;   level.  It beats anything else out there hands down, including<br/>
&gt;   giant charming.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Third,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I and others have made posts about Djarn (Efreeti Lord Djarn)<br/>
&gt;   on this list about 2 or 3 weeks ago I&#39;d say.  And I made the<br/>
&gt;   very specific comment that he is deep, deep, deep inside SolB.<br/>
&gt;   Deep enough and well guarded enough that it takes a minimum of<br/>
&gt;   two high level groups to reach him.  This should at least clue<br/>
&gt;   those few people who actually read these emails &gt;8)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As far as measuring distance in terms a L1 bard can understand<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that important to do, however I don&#39;t use<br/>
&gt;   tracking in outdoor zones unless I&#39;m after a random, roaming,<br/>
&gt;   or rare spawn.  Even if I could try to explain how close I <br/>
&gt;   need to be to track Krak Windchaser (now I&#39;ll have L10 bards<br/>
&gt;   hollering at me, because they don&#39;t know that NPC - gimme<br/>
&gt;   a break heh) it would be in terms of hills and trees and <br/>
&gt;   topography.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So how far is bard tracking in simple terms?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I can find any named mob in most dungeons (SolA, Perma,<br/>
&gt;   Crushbone, etc).  This is sufficient enough to make tracking<br/>
&gt;   useful, although druids at 20 skill can see very similar things<br/>
&gt;   that I can see.  They just dont get a wee bit of extra range.<br/>
&gt;   Where the ranger gets a wee bit longer range than us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Verant didn&#39;t really think through the tracking and how the <br/>
&gt;   skill affects radius.  Because I&#39;ve looked at my tracking and<br/>
&gt;   a druid&#39;s tracking at the same time (2 computers, 2 accounts)<br/>
&gt;   and they look the same.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I guess my point is not how Tracking works, which is what you <br/>
&gt;   lower level people want to know... it&#39;s how far in comparison<br/>
&gt;   it is working.  And the answer is there isn&#39;t a big difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Plus........... it&#39;s my birthday in 2 days, so I get to be right<br/>
&gt;   for once here, and you all can be the ignorant ones =)<br/>
