<b>Subject:</b> Beg Skill Info Request <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-228567455">Someone mentioned that it is possible to beg, potentially multiple platnum<br/>
with a skill over 100.  Well I would really like to know more about this.  I<br/>
have done some begging between levels 1-5 and I have never been attacked<br/>
(some say Im lucky).  I have some questions that I would love answers to<br/>
before I invest some of my well earned (and mostly unused) practice points<br/>
toward.  Here are some things I have heard..... confirmation requested.<br/>
<br/>
With a skill over 100 you can beg multiple platnum.<br/>
<br/>
You can beg from NPC, players pets, and monsters.<br/>
<br/>
The Charismatic Carrillion song will help prevent you from getting attacked<br/>
by NPC&#39;s you beg from.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know that if this stuff is true, are there trade offs?  Is<br/>
it worth it?<br/>
<br/>
Please speak up if you know people who beg, or have raised your skill<br/>
yourself.  I am itching to work on this.  I see it as a way to get paid for<br/>
playing my songs.  <br/>
