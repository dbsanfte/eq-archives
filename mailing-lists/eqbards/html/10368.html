<div id="ygrps-yiv-98880708">Well, I went the safe route today...when I&#39;d been kiting gorge&#39;s at level<br/>
15, I would run a small circle with lute equipped and twist<br/>
selo/bellow/cod...found a nice blue griff today at level 16 and<br/>
selo/bellowed it to death, didn&#39;t take any damage :)  Fight laster around 5<br/>
minutes, which is how long it takes me to fight other blues and then heal<br/>
(poisoning ones and such, non-poison non-bash are easy fights).  Got decent<br/>
exp, but only got 4silver 3copper from it =&#92;<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, was pretty exciting in any case :)<br/>

&gt; Well I haven&#39;t done much kiting as my first attempt at level 17 in<br/>
N.Karana<br/>
&gt; was a disaster.  I was grouped with a level 19 Wizard and we were just<br/>
North<br/>
&gt; of the W.Karana zone on the path.  I was using Selo&#39;s, Bellow and CoD when<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ran too close to a house &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;  I do know that griffawns<br/>
&gt; have double attack and I don&#39;t think solo kiting is really even possible<br/>
&gt; till we get Chains.  It&#39;s been very painful everytime I&#39;ve gotten mixed up<br/>
&gt; with a griff, although I&#39;ve never died thanks to Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious about other bards success kiting with level 20 and under<br/>
songs.<br/>
&gt; How do you balance running out of range for such a long kite if your only<br/>
&gt; bellowing?  And if your using CoD or DDD how much success do you have<br/>
&gt; keeping from attracting other mobs and instakill NPC&#39;s?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For that matter how useful is Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and does anyone<br/>
&gt; actually use it?  Having just gotten level 20 I&#39;ve started using Anthem,<br/>
&gt; Hymn, Largo&#39;s, Bellow or Denons.  I mainly group because soloing pre-20 in<br/>
&gt; S.Karana gave me a lot of exercise in running to the zone :)<br/>

&gt; P.S.  I&#39;m trying to find a good unique surname that goes well with my<br/>
name,<br/>
&gt; email me directly if you have any suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.P.S.  If you do a second P.S. it is done P.P.S. not P.S.S.  P.S. stands<br/>
&gt; for postscript, so a second one is a post postscript, not a postscript<br/>
&gt; script.  However if you just want to add a couple items under one P.S.,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; use P.SS. which is the plural of P.S.  :^)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.P.P.S.  I used to confuse/mis-use these all the time:<br/>
&gt;                 i.e. =  id est &quot;that is (to say)&quot;<br/>
&gt;                 e.g. = exempli gratia &quot;for example&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, I&#39;m not a teacher or an english major, just a picky bastard.  As a<br/>
&gt; matter of fact I had to drop Freshman english because I was failing!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Cool :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; No one knows the dmg equation for CoD?  Thats actually one of the more<br/>
&gt; &gt; important ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15<br/>
(just<br/>
&gt; &gt; got 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; &gt; selos/bellow/bellow (using strings).  Any help is appreciated...oh,<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; know if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>
&gt; &gt; sorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks again,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;With Lute (why sing it without?) it&#39;s 4hp +2 for every 6 levels of<br/>
exp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;at 6th level it&#39;s doing 6 hp per pulse and 12th level it&#39;s 8 hp per<br/>
&gt; pulse<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(sitting).  The weird part is that at 24th level I started doing 13<br/>
hp<br/>
&gt; &gt; per<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pulse and 11 sitting down (the difference used to be just one between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sitting and standing) so I that seems to blow the formula but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I always heard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I often sing it while smacking away in combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are confused a bit mixing in the natural regen rate here.  At 12<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn<br/>
plus<br/>
&gt; 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; natural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from<br/>
Hymn<br/>
&gt; &gt; plus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th<br/>
level,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere<br/>
&gt; soon<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or after 20th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Using my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; &gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; without lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual<br/>
result<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the equation is correct.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; &gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from just sitting without the song) and it improves 2 hp per pulse<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; six<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;levels after.  This is not dependent on string skill level because I<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;keeps going up even after we&#39;ve maxed string.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Same as you get with my equation, Hymn does 4pt at 6th, plus the 2 for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting = 6.<br/>
