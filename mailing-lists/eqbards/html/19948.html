I love when someone who played a character to level 10 or so on Test makes<br/>
this blatant statement.  It was never stated that we should expect<br/>
completely un-announced pwipes on the Test server (not that that really<br/>
matters) it was accepted and expected that we would suffer rollbacks and<br/>
level loss and xp loss and item loss and item changes.  This we endured.<br/>
<br/>
It was also accepted and expected that we would receive no GM support<br/>
whatsoever.  Despite all that many of us played and played to very high<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
The reason people were not expecting a Pwipe and the reason I think a pwipe<br/>
is utterly stupid on Verant&#39;s part is there are places in the game that can<br/>
ONLY be tested by high level players.  Do you really think the HOLE is going<br/>
to be adequately tested by Verant?  Do you think Kunark would be as trouble<br/>
free as it was without us, the testers over there, finding literally<br/>
HUNDREDS of holes in the world where people would fall through and die.<br/>
Where people would recieve horrible faction hits with their own guild?<br/>
Where items would literally kill you if you picked them up?  (yup happened!)<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  Pwipes are certainly an option that Verant was, and remains, free<br/>
to exercize.  But I fail to see how that helps them in the long run when<br/>
dungeons like the hole, a dungeon specifically slated for levels 40-55 is<br/>
about to go into testing (in fact it WAS in testing on test server) and we<br/>
have nobody high enough level to play in it?<br/>
<br/>
Also you just casually dismiss the fact that the players who played Test as<br/>
their primary source of EQ are PAYING $10 a month.  Just like you.  And they<br/>
get no thanks or compensation other than &quot;oops, sorry we deleted you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry.  No offense Sylly.  You&#39;re an intelligent guy but your attitude<br/>
and absolute lack of compassion leave me cold.  Sorry, playing to level 16<br/>
gives you NO perspective on what it takes to level to 50 on an<br/>
underpopulated server that had (when I played regularly) about 20 level 50&#39;s<br/>
on it at all.  It was 10-20 times harder to do a planes run and infinitely<br/>
harder to do dragon runs.  Yet you casually say &quot;a pwipe is no big deal, you<br/>
should have expected it&quot;.  No, we were led to believe it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
In fact it had *never* happened in the two years I have played EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Personally yeah I&#39;m a little upset about losing my character on Test.  But I<br/>
had friends there that ALL THEY DID was play on Test.  And no, it states<br/>
NOWHERE that the test server might be subject to pwipes.  In fact Gordon<br/>
specifically stated, once upon a moon ago, that he felt it was highly<br/>
unlikely that Test would ever get wiped due to the need for high level<br/>
testers.  Many players, at that time, decided it was &quot;Safe&quot; to play on test<br/>
because of that statement.<br/>
<br/>
Granted he didn&#39;t make a 100% guarantee (heh like Gordon will EVER promise<br/>
anything 100%) but many people considered his words as such.<br/>
<br/>
I know, personally, of at least 20 players who were avid testers who have<br/>
cancelled their EQ accounts already.  I&#39;m not going to quit but I will not<br/>
be going back to the Test server.<br/>
<br/>
And no, they&#39;ve never done a pwipe before.  Ever.  Even in beta there were<br/>
no pwipes.  The only &quot;wipe&quot; was from Beta 3.5 to Beta 4 and we were all<br/>
allowed to have our characters restored from backup onto the test server<br/>
during Beta 4.  So, effectively, there were never, in two entire years, a<br/>
player wipe.  Get your facts straight before you make a post of this type.<br/>

&gt; Verant could do anything they wanted with<br/>
&gt; Test. Its not a production server. They HAVE done player wipes before. </span></blockquote></div>
