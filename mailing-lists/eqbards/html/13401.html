<div id="ygrps-yiv-655282666">I find Lament great for getting past casters that &quot;see invis&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is especially useful in Sol A, to get to the Zone near the<br/>
Foreman/Efreeti area you have to pass alot of crap, this is ok if none of<br/>
the mobs are casters but you can guarentee 9 times out of 10 there will be<br/>
at least 1 Wizard or Shamen in your way. Just drop invis, Lament the cast,<br/>
then stroll past it.<br/>
<br/>
No need to clear trash, and you can get to the good spawns at full<br/>
health/mana  =)<br/>

Ps, been residing in Kedge the last few days, exp is great there and it&#39;s<br/>
good fun. Anyone know what kind of good stuff drops there? Our group have<br/>
been as low as the 2nd level and it&#39;s damn scary. We killed a Cauldron<br/>
shark and then a Hammerhead shark spawned in it&#39;s place, it was red a level<br/>
38 so I am wondering if it&#39;s a named mob that drops something good.<br/>

Lament worked fine, pathing is goofy there. If you<br/>
lament the 4 static lizzies near the temple steps (2<br/>
silver guards, 2 prot/sent/fan/heralds) and pull one<br/>
by the door, it will path right over the lizard<br/>
opposite of it. Without lament, you&#39;d get all 4. I<br/>
usually pulled for my party, from the temple into the<br/>
&quot;fishbowl&quot; as we called it. (You called it the arena).<br/>
We were lvl 25-29 at the time, and a roamer could hurt<br/>
us bad. We would get 2 lizzies at a time, sometimes 3,<br/>
still easily managable. Lament was great for us, and<br/>
it works everywhere in Cazic.<br/>
