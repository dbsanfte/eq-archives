<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327853282">Sometimes I&#39;m slow so you may all know this, but I&#39;ve learned so much on<br/>
this list I want to at least attempt to share new uses for songs...<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in Najena fighting the ogre captain to help a guildmate get<br/>
some large bronze armor.  The captain is level 30 or so and he always spawns<br/>
with help so its a tough battle.  Just as we pulled the captain the last<br/>
time last night, our magician went linkdead and our two large bodies started<br/>
banging on the wrong bodies.  The officer that came with the captain<br/>
dispatched one of our members in short work and had the other one down to a<br/>
bubble of health (and I hadn&#39;t even put a dent in the captain yet!). I<br/>
yelled the run command, gave my mostly dead ogre friend a head start and<br/>
then it hit me, why should I get stunned all the way out of the dungeon?!? I<br/>
turned on Lullaby and we ran out.  Every time a monster got close in the<br/>
train we created on that run, their head would nod. I got hit only twice on<br/>
the whole run and saved one party members life! Of course, I would never<br/>
have tried it if Najena was an outdoorsy type of place. :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, one side effect I realized as I ran is that my song did get ALL the<br/>
monsters I passed on my tail, even the ones that were green enough that they<br/>
had stopped attacking me on sight.  It could backfire if you don&#39;t know the<br/>
zone very well.<br/>
