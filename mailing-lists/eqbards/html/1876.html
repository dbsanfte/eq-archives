<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994227677">Could I get some more clarification on this song? I know I am only level 8,<br/>
but I prefer to keep meticulous records, and this song appears nowhere in my<br/>
information....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; when you say &quot;We&#39;d kicked around the idea around&quot;, does that mean you are<br/>
&gt; part of the development team?  i know you are level 45+ bard right?<br/>
anyway,<br/>
&gt; any info on where the song is found?  i think the 5 bard vendors have been<br/>
&gt; checked. plus i heard it is level 43, so i want it =)<br/>

&gt; It has no effect at all on Clarity and the rate at which your party<br/>
members<br/>
&gt; regen mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Desperate Dirge is VERY powerful for a bard song.  Most bard songs are<br/>
&gt; classified as cantrips, quick little spells that have minor duration and<br/>
&gt; impact when song once, but add up over time.  This song breaks out of that<br/>
&gt; mold completely.  The mana use, and the lack of regen, was needed to keep<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; from being overused.  As the name implies, it&#39;s a last ditch effort on the<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s part to end a combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;d kicked around the idea of the song stunning the bard for 10 to 30<br/>
&gt; seconds as another balance factor, or using a horn or lute as a consumable<br/>
&gt; reagent, but neither proved practical, or easy to code.  The change making<br/>
&gt; bards immune to mana regen was relatively easy to implement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes of just sitting to regen all that<br/>
&gt; mana once you cast the song, twice that if you remain standing.  And thats<br/>
&gt; as it should be.  The song rivals harm touch at that level in damage done<br/>
(A<br/>
&gt; 43rd level SK can do 430 to a SINGLE target), and this song will hit FOUR<br/>
&gt; targets.  That&#39;s 1600 damage, fast.  It&#39;s use should be limited.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it might encourage bards to wear more mana and mana stat boosting<br/>
items,<br/>
&gt; so they can have a larger mana reserve to draw from, speeding downtime<br/>
&gt; between songs a bit.  This is fine, as it means in most cases that they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; have to give up better armor to wear the low or no AC caster tuned garb.<br/>

&gt; I read it the same way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>
&gt; possible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; change that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana regen for<br/>
&gt; other party members (or maybe I just read it wrong).<br/>
