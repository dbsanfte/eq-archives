&gt;    The NPC binding though seems from the design perspective to be<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve seen there is nothing equivalent to it within the design.  The closest<br/>
&gt;would be to sell an item (scroll?) that cast the same spell.  This might<br/>
&gt;stray from their design philosophy...<br/>

the appropriate trigger.  Why would this be any different?<br/>

&gt;    So perhaps we should ask them to create a scroll or potion or some other<br/>
&gt;item with one charge that casts the same spell that people cast when they<br/>
&gt;bind us (i.e. it will fail if cast in a non-city zone)...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They already have at least one item that does it, also.... It&#39;s not far<br/>
from their design philosophy - they&#39;re just being very resistant.<br/>
