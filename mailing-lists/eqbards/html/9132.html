&gt; Bah, it&#39;s about 81 pounds.  You can run with it just fine.<br/>
&gt; With Accelerando and a drum, you&#39;ll probably still be faster<br/>
&gt; than SoW unencumbered (with a MM drum you definitely will be).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know... that gnome is one fast little dude.  :)   In full gear, an extra 81 pounds would<br/>
slow me down considerably.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that a bard wants to get the boots anyway.  The real challenge is for someone<br/>
like a necro to catch this little guy while carrying that much.  I know that my necro would be<br/>
crawling with that much on him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest working as a team.  One or more people find the guy, then pin him down with /hail<br/>
while you slog over with the cash :)<br/>
