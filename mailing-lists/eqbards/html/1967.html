<div id="ygrps-yiv-397753854">Ah yes! I meant Kaladim. The island of Faydwer is still a mystery to<br/>
me, and the names confuse me quite often. Kaladim, Kelethin, Felwithe,<br/>
who can keep track? Anyway, the dwarf to talk to normally stands right<br/>
inside the entrance to the mine. Of course, the other day when I went<br/>
to look he was standing by the bank. Maybe he was encumbered by<br/>
tongues?<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t remember his name, but like I said, he is<br/>
usually standing just inside the mine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My wandering friend, do you mean Kaladim, since you say you spoke to a<br/>
dwarf.  Would this be one of the dwarves that loiter outside the<br/>
Kaladim<br/>
bank?  Perhaps you recall his name?  Two of my adventuring companions<br/>
have<br/>
full collections of dwarf bandit tongues and have not found a use for<br/>
them.<br/>
