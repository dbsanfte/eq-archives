I think I am missing something- I was helping some guild members with their<br/>
quest when i was lvl 33 or 34- we were fighting shadowmen in West<br/>
Commons,and they all conned green to me. How would greenies kill a lvl 50? I<br/>
only fought them for a couple of hours and got no xp- didnt care because I<br/>
was there for moral support :)- but I didnt realize they were that nasty?<br/>
Was I just lucky? The rest of the group I was helping were mid 20&#39;s as I<br/>
remember.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Problem is that if you don&#39;t have screech, shadow men are going to be<br/>

&gt;  You took the words right out of my fingers before I could type them.<br/>
&gt;  Shadowmen should con even to L26ish people, iirc.  I would avoid<br/>
&gt;  shadowmen at all costs, L1 or L50.  They are simply trouble unless<br/>
&gt;  you are helping someone with quest items.<br/>
