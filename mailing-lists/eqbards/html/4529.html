 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Not only that, the frequency with which mobs were<br/>
breaking out of song effects seems to have increased (either<br/>
that or the random number generator is really crappy).  I mean<br/>
at level 29, you&#39;d think a green drybone wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
instantly break out of four Chains in a row.<br/>

reconfigure it.  Create buttons for all your favorite pet<br/>
commands and put them on your hotkeys.<br/>
