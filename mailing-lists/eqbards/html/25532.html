&gt;No, I didn&#39;t win the contest...<br/>
&gt;E.J., the shaman got 1st place, and the Troll got 2nd.  They get custom<br/>
&gt;art of their characters done for winning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I saw that shaman all day, and kept thinking, &quot;Damn, he looks familiar&quot;  I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize it was the costume, though *chuckles*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Talies, I was in EK as a bard at 16...if you go down by the shore, past<br/>
&gt;the bridge from runnyeye, (around -1000 to -2000) you can pull single<br/>
&gt;gnolls and kite them up and down the shore...but if you get any adds,<br/>
&gt;head for the bridge and zone...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At 18, I learned the 2 instrument/3 song twist here, fighting 2-4 gnolls<br/>
&gt;at a time.  It&#39;s easy xp then...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hopefully easier with my beautiful Lute of the Howler...  I guess I&#39;ll have <br/>
to get a horn before I get that song, though, huh?<br/>
