<div id="ygrps-yiv-28979109">One tidbit to add here...Mystere is the author of *both* stories,<br/>
they&#39;re just written under different names, for reasons I am not aware<br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
He has also said that he&#39;s a happily married man with 5 wonderful,<br/>
un-abused children.  The &quot;14 seasons&quot; reference is meant to convey<br/>
naivete and innocence, not age.  His stories are not fantasies he<br/>
wishes to act out, just dark stories.  The rape one was his attempt at<br/>
a backstory for a dark elven rogue that he was going to create.  (On a<br/>
side note, a lot of people who write backstories for female characters<br/>
have a common thread of rape, and not just men writing them either.)<br/>
I think they went a little overboard here, especially having not<br/>
talked to the guy first.<br/>
