<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032641563">Complain?  I&#39;m not complaining - I am stating an &#39;opinion&#39;. Bards are one<br/>
of the few classes people don&#39;t seem to have reservations about - druids<br/>
and wizards both tend to have bottom of the barrel reputations as a class -<br/>
I don&#39;t want people lumping bards in with it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry YOU don&#39;t like caps and quotes - I type like I would speak - and yes,<br/>
I do put emphasis on certain words.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem with a member of our own<br/>
&gt;&gt; class engaging in behavior that is so intrusive of others? It&#39;s bad when I<br/>
&gt;&gt; do something dumb and endanger myself, or my group - endangering bystanders<br/>
&gt;&gt; is just unforgiveable in my book, especially when it&#39;s unnecessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You do nothing but complain on this list.  And you don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;  sign your name.  I&#39;m a little concerned that you have some built<br/>
&gt;  up anger inside.  (I&#39;ve mentioned it before through the use of<br/>
&gt;  your &quot;quotation marks&quot; and CAPITALIZATION.)  Is there something<br/>
&gt;  we can do to calm you down?<br/>
