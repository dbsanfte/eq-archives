<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188396775">Another point on the idea of backing off or waiting to nuke in the case of<br/>
casters.  Because they have limited mana, if a caster nukes in the first<br/>
half of a fight or the second half of the fight it doesn&#39;t matter they do<br/>
the same damage and are just as effective damage-wise either way.  They<br/>
would be wasting mana if they nuked constantly anyhow.  If a bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
sing for half the fight its a huge hit to their effectiveness, since there<br/>
is no wasting of mana to deal with.  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>
ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>
extra attacks for part of a fight?  Of course not.  The main reason to have<br/>
nukers wait is because they have limited mana anyhow and they will avoid<br/>
getting hurt and still do just as much damage by waiting.  Bards do not have<br/>
this luxury.<br/>
