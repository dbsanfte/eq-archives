<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035986335">My guess is that starting right now overcrowding will hardly be a problem,<br/>
even on Fenin Ro, the most croded of all severs. The &quot;wave&quot; of players<br/>
(i.e. the level that the most players are) is right about level 16 right<br/>
now I think. The newbie areas are not too bad.<br/>

&gt;Well, as I said before I haven&#39;t yet played in commercial. Now that I am <br/>
&gt;settled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially <br/>
&gt;those that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as <br/>
&gt;to what the best servers are to play on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right <br/>
&gt;about to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure <br/>
&gt;powergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep up <br/>
&gt;with them. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of taking it easy. I did all the <br/>
&gt;powergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP <br/>
&gt;aspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even <br/>
&gt;more crowded than before. Any info on this will be much appreciated! <br/>
&gt;Especially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I am <br/>
&gt;thinking getting on the newest server would be ideal, though I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt;which one is newest. Cazic?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance everyone!  =)<br/>
