<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416142899">Does anyone know WHY they thought to fix surfing? I liked surfing.. anyone<br/>
think we have a chance in heck of getting it back?  Other things I have<br/>
noticed..<br/>
<br/>
Better &quot;3d&quot; sound support I can actually hear which direction a creature is<br/>
coming from or where a battle is. At least on an SB live<br/>
<br/>
now get two resist messages on lullaby.. effectiveness of the song is still<br/>
slightly questionable given the second resist is far too common even on low<br/>
level lizard warriors outside Caziac.<br/>
<br/>
Less flicker on some zone graphics<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I saw last night in about 2 hours of play.<br/>

&gt;Well, the Meditate skill is pretty sweet.  Didn&#39;t even have to zone for it<br/>
&gt;to work (read somewhere that we would have to zone for it to kick in the<br/>
&gt;first time).  Also noticed crocs (blue to me at 17) in Lake Rathe, and<br/>

&gt;tidbit... you can no longer consume vast amounts of alcohol.  Once you get<br/>
&gt;to your... uhm... &quot;drunkenness limit&quot;, you now get a message saying &quot;You<br/>
&gt;could not possibly consume more alcohol or get any more intoxicated!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;Also, you get skill increases even when drunk now (maybe it was the fact<br/>

&gt;Anyone else notice any other hidden things?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I did -- I no longer &#39;surf&#39; the landscape when running and playing<br/>
Selo&#39;s. They&#39;ve<br/>
added animations so we now run and play a lute/drumstick.<br/>
