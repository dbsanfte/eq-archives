<div id="ygrps-yiv-184810752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One idea was rather than make it a most-points-wins system,<br/>
&gt; turn it into a weighted lotto.  If person A has 15 points, B<br/>
&gt; has 7 points, C has 4 points, and visitor D has 2 points, then<br/>
&gt; you do a /random 1 28.  1-15, A wins; 16-22, B wins; 23-26, C<br/>
&gt; wins; 26-27 D wins.  I&#39;m trying to figure out a simpler way to<br/>
&gt; do this that automatically incorporates the weighting without<br/>
&gt; requiring you to do the math.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is what we do.  it isn&#39;t most points wins.  we just added a new tier<br/>
for people with 5+ points over the point value of the item.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I also suggested scaling the points down so people who go to a<br/>
&gt; lot of these events don&#39;t have an overwhelming advantage over<br/>
&gt; people who can&#39;t go as often.  If you have 1-10 points, each<br/>
&gt; dragon/god trip is worth 1 point.  If you have 11-20 points,<br/>
&gt; you need two trips to gain an extra point.  If you have 21-30,<br/>
&gt; you need three trips per point.  etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our officers disagreed here apparently.  they feel those who put in the most<br/>
time should have a large advantage over those who don&#39;t.  more time should<br/>
equal more items.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Planes armor should be relatively simple if you can trust the<br/>
&gt; people there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is also what we have done recently.  we are relying more on an honor<br/>
system for armor loot.  e.g. a cleric in our guild, one of the first 50s on<br/>
the server, and spending 6 months in the planes, had still not gotten legs<br/>
or bracers.  meanwhile, every other newly 50 cleric was coming up and<br/>
reaping tons of cleric armor, including items he needed.  this kinda forced<br/>
us to reevaluate how to distribute armor.  soon after, legs dropped and<br/>
another cleric there who needed them but was not in the planes nearly as<br/>
long gladly allowed the veteran cleric to loot.  unfortunately, looks like<br/>
Tyria may have to sit out some carmine lottos =)<br/>
