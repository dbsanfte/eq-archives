<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269600768">Doesn&#39;t take that long to use up a stack of foraged grubs, I always forage<br/>
and save the grubs...when I get a stack of 20 I spend a few minutes before<br/>
logging using them up.  I have fished so much that I have broken a total of<br/>
4 fishing rods since April 1999.<br/>

&gt; And if you spent the same time killing mobs you&#39;d probably <br/>
&gt; come out with<br/>
&gt; more cash and more exp for the same time spent. Fishing at <br/>
&gt; low levels is<br/>
&gt; only worth the time spent on it if you put an extremely low value on<br/>
&gt; your time. </span></blockquote></div>
