<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057118351">I personally think that our songs are what get us in hot water.  For a test,<br/>
try singing nothing when your puller grabs some MOBs.  They&#39;ll stick on him<br/>
- or at least they do in my experiece.  If I have any song going when the<br/>
puller comes back to the group, the &quot;free&quot; MOBs will start attacking me.  I<br/>
often wonder what would happen if I handled my songs in the same manner that<br/>
(skilled) magic-users do (i.e. don&#39;t sing anything until the MOBs in<br/>
question have taken a decent throttling from the tanks).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to be the case for me as well. All extra mobs on a pull will<br/>
attack me almost 100% of the time. And any passing mob will attack me when<br/>
it joins in a fight.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if it is because I&#39;m playing Hymn? I&#39;m guessing that when the<br/>
mobs come over and they&#39;re not really mad at anyone yet (just a little bit<br/>
at the puller) then they&#39;ll want to attack me since I&#39;m healing. Or is it<br/>
the vague &quot;Bard Hate&quot; thing. :) What do you guys think?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to try to NOT play Hymn at the very beginning of a battle<br/>
(so far I&#39;m always twisting Anthem and Hymn, even in the very beginning when<br/>
no one is hurt). Hopefully the mobs that are not being fought yet will hit<br/>
the tanks and/or puller, and then several rounds later when I start to play<br/>
Hymn they won&#39;t be so mad at me.<br/>
