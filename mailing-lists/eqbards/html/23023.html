&gt;yes, if i think we are perfectly balanced I would NOT want that to <br/>
&gt;happen.  it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;a slippery slope.  how about this?  would you want bards to get a lure series<br/>
&gt;of spells and teleports?  It has to do with the integrity of the game and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well put. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons of things that we&#39;d love. But our requests, <br/>
to be reasonable to Verant, also have to take into account the game balance <br/>
and try to maintain it&#39;s integrity.<br/>
<br/>
The haste suggestions that have been put out there are enticing. I haven&#39;t <br/>
had much to say about this thread since I&#39;ve only recently gotten back into <br/>
consistently grouping with other people (really, really bored to death with <br/>
charm kiting the same old places). My understanding of Verant&#39;s position on <br/>
the current state of haste is that it is balanced,  which would seem to <br/>
indicate that have little inclination to change it.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to be able to give them a compelling reason to change it, which <br/>
would improve overall playability but still retain the challenge of the <br/>
game, then you would help position your argument to differentiate itself <br/>
from the tons of the bad &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be great&quot; ideas.<br/>
