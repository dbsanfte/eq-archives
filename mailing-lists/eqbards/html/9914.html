<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037986409">it is 100, 1000 or something very close.  if you find the named treant<br/>
X-something long name, the tower is right in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
also regarding wearing different bracers (until you get your seconde<br/>
lambent)...  place the bracer you do not want people to see in your wrist<br/>
slot 1 first, then place the bracer you do want people to see in wrist slot<br/>
2.  at this time you and everyone will see what is in wrist slot 2.  after<br/>
you zone however, YOU will see what is in wrist slot 1, but everyone else<br/>
will see what is in wrist slot 2.  just a short-term fix, i know its<br/>
annoying i have been /bugging it since the first month of release.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; speaking of which, at some point on this list, someone posted <br/>
&gt; the loc of a<br/>
&gt; spawn spot of a griffene, im so sick of wandering around <br/>
&gt; aimlessly with only<br/>
&gt; griffawns spawning on me, and the few times i do get a <br/>
&gt; griffene it doesnt<br/>
&gt; have the charm. gets annoying to switch bracers all the time <br/>
&gt; so that the<br/>
&gt; blue shows instead of my silver plated one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone able to help me out by giving me a loc of a spawn spot of these<br/>
&gt; annoying critters to find<br/>
