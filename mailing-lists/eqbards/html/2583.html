OK, folks, the whistle has been blown...That means a timeout....<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please, take this argument elsewhere. I&#39;m not trying to be a<br/>
control freak, and I&#39;m not trying to take sides....I just believe (as I&#39;m<br/>
sure some of the rest of you do...) that this thread no longer applies to<br/>
the tenets of this mailing list...In other words, I no longer believe this<br/>
is bard-related material. Please take this to another forum (such as the<br/>
General Message board on EQVault) or even take it private...<br/>
<br/>
This thread was interesting in it&#39;s early stages, but I believe that this<br/>
last message may have crossed the line. But, hey, that&#39;s only my opinion and<br/>
you guys are free to ignore it....<br/>

&gt; Hey, Cooter, I have a message for you.  I won&#39;t be subtle because that<br/>
&gt; would be too far beyond your ability to comprehend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re a boneheaded jerk of limited vision who can&#39;t tell a fantasy game<br/>
&gt; from just another bit of software to wring dry and discard.  You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; recognize a reasonable principle if it slapped you in the face.  You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; also an ignorant bigot who assumes anyone who disagrees is stupid or evil.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re the sort that spoils whatever they do by making it a contest they<br/>
&gt; must win at all costs, no holds barred, no rules, no consideration other<br/>
&gt; than winning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In Norrath a bard name of Cooter<br/>
&gt; Was only a bug-using looter<br/>
&gt; He just didn&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; For a fantasy, fair<br/>
&gt; He&#39;d ride through and shoot from a scooter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m probably not skilled enough to offend you sufficiently that you&#39;ll go<br/>
&gt; away.  I like alternate points of view that make me think but some are<br/>
&gt; simply so ignorant and stupid they make me vomit.  As far as I personally<br/>
&gt; am concerned please feel free to leave us powermad control mongers and our<br/>
&gt; more honorable, perceptive opponents to discuss how many angels look nice<br/>
&gt; arranged on the head of a pin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bob<br/>
