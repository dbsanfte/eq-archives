<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802638195">The key seems to be that it was in a container.  LORE items in containers are<br/>
lost when dropped.<br/>
<br/>
At least that seems to be what is emerging from this discussion.<br/>

&gt; I can verify that some items CAN be lost when you drop<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A week ago, I lost a Dragoon Dirk that was in a<br/>
&gt; backpack.  I acidentally dropped the pack, and the<br/>
&gt; dirk disappeared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, last night, I dropped a Dirk (yes, I broke<br/>
&gt; down and bought another one....Wisps and FS Weapon<br/>
&gt; runs to Cazic are quite lucrative) and it was still<br/>
&gt; there for me to pick it up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not sure what the underlying story is on when items<br/>
&gt; disappear and when they stay, but it&#39;d be REAL nice<br/>
&gt; for us to know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry about your loss...that must have HURT (the dirk<br/>
&gt; did, and they can be had for 30p)<br/>
