&gt; yes it is believed higher charisma definitely makes your charms song last<br/>
&gt; longer.  Dex and Str are melee abilities, Dex allowing you to miss less, and<br/>
&gt; Str allowing you to hit harder (and carry more of course).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anyone found much noticable improvement with these skills over 100<br/>
or so? I tried collecting all the dex, str and agility items I could<br/>
borrow from friends or had stuck away in my bank and I really couldn&#39;t<br/>
see much difference in how often I hit between around 105 dex to up to<br/>
128 dex. Likewise pumping agility from 102 to around 130 (counting<br/>
ranger&#39;s feet like cat buff) seemed to not really cause me to get<br/>
hit noticably less. Strength doesn&#39;t seem to matter much either bumped<br/>
from my usual 117 up to 157 with items, and various strenth buffs.<br/>
<br/>
People seem to think there&#39;s certain &quot;magic&quot; numbers where&#39;s there&#39;s a<br/>
huge leap in improvement. The one&#39;s I&#39;ve heard are 76 and 100, and some<br/>
say another at 150, but it seems over 100 doesn&#39;t noticably make a lot<br/>
of difference.<br/>
