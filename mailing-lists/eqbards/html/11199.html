<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890829093">Greetings and well met everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am just postin a short message about Lady Vox being killed on Tarew Marr server (I think for the first time)<br/>
<br/>
I think I had the most fun time I have had in the game since release excitement. There were several bards there all in great need. People were screaming they needed a bard in their group (mainly for the mr and cold resist factors than mana) me being the lowest person there (i think) at 40th level and my first time on a huge adventure like this I was chain smoking :)<br/>
<br/>
I know at least one of the bards that were there is on this list besides my self that being Maev.<br/>
<br/>
Other bards oncluded Theog, Ryana Fendryl(spelling) and some other blueberries I didnt get the names. We had I think right at 40 people with us.<br/>
<br/>
We cleared the ice giant priests magi etc. We got to her lair and I must say that she has one hell of an area ice spell :)<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY bad part about it and Maev I know will have words on this was the loot randoming at the end. BIG FIGHTING on who should be in the random of each item. Other than that I was honored to be a part of it, speciallly at level 40.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did take several sceen shots if anyone wants them only 2 of vox her self as I didnt really have the time to hit ANOTHER button. But they are neat none the less<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know what she dropped I will list to the best of my knowledge(since I didnt win anyof it :)) if You dont want to know ill leave some spoiler space....<br/>

To the best of my knowledge these are the items and stats that Lady Vox had on her:<br/>
<br/>
Spear 13dmge 35 delay<br/>
Belt 10 str 10dex 10 agil and haste effect they said was broken<br/>
a 2handed hammer that proced the rune 3 spell<br/>
a 10 slot bag that reduced weight 100%<br/>
2 dragon teeth that either were for 49th necro pet research OR had one charge of the necro 49th pet spell ( i could never get a straight answer)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly correct if not EXTREMELY near to the stats of the loot on her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to everyone who took part in her demise...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks maev for you good points durring the horrible loot arguements at the end.</div>
