&gt;Someone asked earlier if there were any bard quests currently in the<br/>
&gt;Temple of Solusek Ro. Well due to level 50 boredom, I make a newbie dark<br/>
&gt;elf on the test server and went to check it out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are indeed 2 bard NPCs there, but they were in fact the only 2<br/>
&gt;NPCs in there who wouldnt talk to me. They con&#39;d apprehensive, while<br/>
&gt;everything else was indifferent no matter what race/class it was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far I&#39;ve only seen NPCs for misc stuff (resetting your specialization<br/>
&gt;skills), Necros, Wizards, Mages, Clerics, and Bards. So guess we lucked<br/>
&gt;out so far unless they&#39;re still adding other quest NPCs for other<br/>
&gt;classes.<br/>
