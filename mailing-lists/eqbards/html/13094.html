<b>Subject:</b> Bards vs Enchanters Part 2 with a little Lullaby thrown in (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-571446784">The enchanter&#39;s AE mez may have worked initially, but we assumed that he<br/>
would be OOM a long time before we killed all the mobs.  If we had gone that<br/>
route, then I and the other bard could have started playing lullaby at that<br/>
point to try and keep all the mobs off the enchanter while he medded.  We<br/>
decided that the enchanter would contribute more by casting his charm, stun,<br/>
and DOT spells and let the two bards handle crowd control.  For each mob we<br/>
faced, he would have his pet attack, stun once, DOT once, then med and let<br/>
the two tanks and other bard finish off the mob.  Doing it this way<br/>
conserved his mana for the rest of the battle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;m curious though why you thought the enchanter wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; able to AE mes.  Most enchanters I know just cast AE mes again<br/>
&gt; before the mobs wake up from the previous one.  If something<br/>
&gt; starts attacking the enchanter, taunt/charm it off him and go<br/>
&gt; back to work.  (Although in this case it probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have worked because the enchanter would&#39;ve been OOM before you<br/>
&gt; killed everything.)<br/>
