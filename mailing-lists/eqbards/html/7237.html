I haven&#39;t been attacked either, but I have seen with my own<br/>
eyes someone killed by a guard for begging from him (something<br/>
like &quot;I hate pitiful beggars like you.&quot;).<br/>

message when I succeed.<br/>

Has anyone noticed that the obscure bard guildmasters seem to<br/>
teach all the languages out there?  The wandering bard in<br/>
Qeynos didn&#39;t teach instill doubt, but she did list every<br/>
language I&#39;d ever heard about.  I&#39;d always wondered where you<br/>
learned Elder Tier&#39;dal (kobold) or Dragon, and it turns out to<br/>
be from my own guildmasters....<br/>
