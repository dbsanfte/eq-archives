Not that I disagree with your other statements. I was also in beta and,<br/>
I felt, was pretty religious about submitting bug reports and actually<br/>
testing things, but when final came and they expected you to pay to test<br/>
for them I took a pass on it. It&#39;s bad enough paying to test their<br/>
release code. I think the best thing that could happen right now is for<br/>
everyone to stop playing on the test server. Verant doesn&#39;t deserve you.<br/>
