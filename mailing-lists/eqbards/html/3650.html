<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030852328">Well, I identified the head that should be a compendium with a song.  It belongs on the body of a one Pungla.  The very same ogre who stole Clurg&#39;s recipes.  A strange coincidence, if this head is a bug.  That bar is an odd place too.  At one time I&#39;ve seen a male bard and a Dark Elf female making comments on his song, and another time a female bard with a drunkard bum who comments.  I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll have to sit it out in that bar one evening and just listen and watch to see all that happens.  The female bard sang this song, which really got me wondering:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Within my head and inside my brain, I hold the key.  It is not much more<br/>
than the size of a pea.  With it I have the power to set free Oggock city.<br/>
Open up its doors to all that is pretty. Instead, here I am in a pile of my<br/>
own dung smelling quite dingy.  Drinking Ogre Swill with which I am stingy.<br/>
I may have the key, but the point is quite moot.  For you see, I am nothing<br/>
more than a dumb, smelly ogre brute.  Thank you.  I hope you enjoyed that<br/>
one.&quot;<br/>
