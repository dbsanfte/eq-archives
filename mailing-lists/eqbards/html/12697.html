<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615969924">ok i asked this before but everyone may have missed it.  i believe Nag&#39;s<br/>
fear spell is called Dragon Roar, correct?  well that&#39;s the one i see that<br/>
looks like fear and it says i resist the Dragon Roar spell.  now, i can&#39;t<br/>
even remember the last time i was feared, but what happens now is sometimes<br/>
i get the resist message as expected, and other times i get the message that<br/>
i lose control of myself and i have the fear icon, but there is no effect<br/>
(i.e. i am undoubtedly not feared).  what&#39;s up with that?<br/>
