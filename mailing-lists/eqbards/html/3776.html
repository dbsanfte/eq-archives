 </span></blockquote>Yes, a halfling rogue dancing. =) Especially when he&#39;s the only thing<br/>
keeping you entertained after hours and hours and hours and hours and<br/>
hours and hours and hours of jboots camping for friends.. bleh.<br/>
<br/>
Our halfling didn&#39;t just do ducking and moving though. He used /wave,<br/>
/gesture and /cheer to move his body while shouting lyrics. It was quite<br/>
hilarious. He had a few dances, some he was still working on (and showed),<br/>
while others were finely tuned and were quite well choreographed.<br/>
