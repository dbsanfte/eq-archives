<div id="ygrps-yiv-694899957">Lower Guk:<br/>
<br/>
Shin Knights (also the ones in Lower) - drops the gaunts - dead side near<br/>
zone or live side<br/>
Shin Ghoul Knights - shin greaves<br/>
Basalt Gargoyles - lower guk dead side near the bridge to the tower - basalt<br/>
carpace for Lambent BP<br/>
<br/>
From the zone to the dead side, you first encounter live frogs, then some<br/>
undead ones.  Most folks get invis to undead after any live froogies have<br/>
been killed at the zone and down the hall going to the waterway.  Then they<br/>
run past any undead froogs to get in deeper to where the good toys drop. So,<br/>
its zone, hall, waterway then bedroom.  At bedroom is both undead and live<br/>
stuff and 2 halls that go past the vampire bat room.  Most folks wait until<br/>
the bedroom campers kill any loose live stuff then get invis to undead and<br/>
run down left hall - past bat room then down left hall but HUGGING the right<br/>
side of it to get past the Greater Ice Bones Skels.  Past that is the bridge<br/>
to the tower.  On left is a 3 spawn od undead froogs - casters and above<br/>
some gargs.  On right is a hall to the live side and the bug rooms and more<br/>
basalt gargs.  If you wait in the bedroom until the campers kill all the<br/>
loose undead stuff, you might be able to invis down the right hall and pass<br/>
the bat room and pass the bugs (deadly black widows) and get out to the<br/>
bridge to the tower.  Either way - it can be real easy if the zone is<br/>
heavily camped like at a busy time - or very deadly if not over crowded.<br/>
Cross the bridge to the tower and go down the hall past a ladder then make a<br/>
left and look for the next ladder.  That 2nd ladder goes up to the<br/>
assassin/supplier room.  Keep you back to the wall in the assassin room - he<br/>
back stabs for huge amount.<br/>
<br/>
You can get invis to undead potions to supplement your invis or go with<br/>
someone who can cast it.  Or go with someone who can revive you and duel him<br/>
in the zone and have him drag your corpse to the room (and revive you<br/>
there.)  Or let your high level friends do the questing - the finished<br/>
Lambent pieces are trade-able. heh.<br/>
<br/>
You mention dark bones - the NK gryfeenes drop the charm needed for the<br/>
Lambent bracers. Have to do that 2 times or do it with a buddy who will<br/>
carry the extras stuffs for you.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Some Guk questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I finally dragged Elfson away from Kunark (went from 20-26 in about two<br/>
&gt; weeks!).  Feeling confident, (25 was the first level I reached without<br/>
&gt; dying since 5, 26 was the second) I began my search for some lambent<br/>
&gt; armor.  After some unsuccesful searching, I decided to come here with<br/>
&gt; some questions...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically with all these peices, I&#39;d like to know is there a specific<br/>
&gt; mob (IE the Shin Knight down the hall from the preist room) or will any<br/>
&gt; mob of that type drop the item I need.  Also any other advice you could<br/>
&gt; offer for getting them would be great. (like where to find them) (Most<br/>
&gt; of these peices are out my reach right now, but my guild has lots of mid<br/>
&gt; 30&#39;s casters dying to get me to 32, so they are very eager to help me<br/>
&gt; get my lambent, (I assume they want me to get my butt back to ROK for<br/>
&gt; more levels))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dark Boned Bracelets (Greater DB skelly in Unrest)<br/>
&gt; Shin Greaves (Shin Knight, upper guk)<br/>
&gt; Shin Gauntlets (Ghoul Shin Knight, lower guk)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also since I am in Guk, I am trying to get the Mask of the Deceiver.<br/>
&gt; The person camping it on Saturday was willing to let me loot it, but I<br/>
&gt; could never find the room.  How do you ge there?  Will I make it with<br/>
&gt; invisibility?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well thanks for the help :)<br/>

&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
