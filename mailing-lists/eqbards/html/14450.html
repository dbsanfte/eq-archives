<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I am able to enter Ogguk without problems when I use the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guise of deception. The Bouncers con indifferent and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; merchants inside con amiable. I am a agnostic woodelf btw.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I picked this because thats what I am. I use the DE<br/>
&gt; &gt; illusion everytime I run through Ferrot or is resting<br/>
&gt; &gt; outside CZ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mask is no-drop and (now) only usable by two classes.<br/>
&gt; There are relatively easy (though time-consuming) ways to<br/>
&gt; become non-KOS to virtually all the good races.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; anyone has figured out a way to raise your faction with the<br/>
&gt; Neriak and Nektulos guards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IF  you can enter neriak with the mask and cinda&#39;s charismatic<br/>
carallion(I dont have one yet :()<br/>
it might be possible to get to lokar tobiath in the library (hes a<br/>
necro, one more problem hehe) and give him red wine (I think 40 should<br/>
raise 1 faction) for factions with inner and outer guards and<br/>
bargainers.<br/>
Im sure you dont want to die in neriak so this would be a very tough<br/>
task :)<br/>
<br/>
