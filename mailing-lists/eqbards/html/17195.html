<div id="ygrps-yiv-165799989">You&#39;re definitely right.  I need to find some friends who are willing to<br/>
play melee types if I am going to play my bard much more.  I have found that<br/>
in a group that melee heavy I can be a huge boon, but in a caster heavy<br/>
group I&#39;m just a victim.  Unfortunately every time I have made a melee<br/>
friend or two they have leveled past me very quickly.  Met a great dwarf<br/>
named Flint a couple weeks ago.  He was 24th at the time.  Last time I saw<br/>
him he was 29th already barely a week later.<br/>
<br/>
I may try a few hunting trips from my sunny retreat over to the isle that&#39;s<br/>
paved in platinum gargoyle eyes from what I hear.  Our 22nd level ranger was<br/>
able to solo there all the way to 24th so I should be able to handle it.<br/>

I&#39;ll resist the temptation to tell you to get yourself some new friends and<br/>
instead suggest you work out a strategy with them where someone else takes<br/>
the initial damage (the cleric, if it&#39;s just you a cleric and an enchanter)<br/>
then you kick in your mega-taunting Hymn and taunt it off.  Maybe then no<br/>
one will die, or at least death won&#39;t be predetermined.<br/>
<br/>
The only other option I see for you, other than getting yourself some new<br/>
friends, which I won&#39;t say, is to take Rokenn&#39;s advice and go solo for a<br/>
while.  <br/>
<br/>
