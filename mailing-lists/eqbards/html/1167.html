<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427602996">The best cash I have found is from killing Dervish Cutthroats.  There<br/>
are camps in NRO that are usually camped out.  There is one rather large<br/>
camp that is in West Commons that is not always camped out because only<br/>
good groups or exceedingly high levels can handle it, but as soon as you<br/>
get a group organized to crack it open, the vultures appear and expect<br/>
you to share it.  There are a couple more derv camps in SRO that I have<br/>
found to be much less busy, probably because a lot of people don&#39;t like<br/>
to travel through Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
The good loot is in the form of bronze weapons and cutthroat rings.<br/>
