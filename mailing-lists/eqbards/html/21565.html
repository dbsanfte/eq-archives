<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535874755">Hmm, I&#39;m wearing 2 electrum star ruby rings (+5 dex,<br/>
+7 charisma), an Opaline earing, some crappy earing<br/>
that I need to replace (+2 agility I think), neck is<br/>
the thingie from the squire (AC 5 +7 to 2 resists),<br/>
back is cloak of the icebear.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you I would upgrade the necklace to a runed<br/>
lava pendant.  It&#39;s AC 5 +6 strength, and +3? fire<br/>
protection I think.  It&#39;s mainly a strength piece.  I<br/>
like charisma pieces pimarily but I always seem to get<br/>
encumbered so strength is the way I&#39;d go.  I would<br/>
also go with either the lizardscale cloak or cloak of<br/>
the icebear.  Same AC and dex vs, resists.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh incidently, the pendent is droped by a 35th level<br/>
mob in Solusek A.  I&#39;m going to go camp him once I<br/>
make 47th.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help on the quest.  I am in SK now<br/>
&gt; and plan just to run over<br/>
&gt; to Queynos and take a trip to Erudin while I am not<br/>
&gt; in Kunark.  Also, thanks<br/>
&gt; for sharing your kite areas.  I am just starting to<br/>
&gt; do OT and find it works<br/>
&gt; pretty well there, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my next question - just keeping the list active<br/>
&gt; =).  I have some<br/>
&gt; Lambent(Helm, gauntlets and bracer) and plan to get<br/>
&gt; the rest.  Yeah, varied<br/>
&gt; opinions on if it is the &quot;best&quot; armor for us, but I<br/>
&gt; want to at least have<br/>
&gt; the look for a while.  My query is on options on my<br/>
&gt; other armor - cloak,<br/>
&gt; rings, earrings, neck, face, etc.  I have a jagged<br/>
&gt; band, a +7 Cha ring, a<br/>
&gt; splintered bronze cloak, 2 oppoline Cha earrings and<br/>
&gt; some + Cha necklace,<br/>
&gt; Splitpaw maybe.  I have been lucky in FM and have<br/>
&gt; used pp from my two loops<br/>
&gt; to purchase a MM drum (800) and currently have my<br/>
&gt; remaining stash (1300ish)<br/>
&gt; burning a hole in my pocket.  I have most of the<br/>
&gt; gems already for my<br/>
&gt; Lambent, so I don&#39;t need to spend for them.  My<br/>
&gt; weapons are Obsidian Shard,<br/>
&gt; Pugius, Dragoon Dirk in range slot and I use Gnoll<br/>
&gt; Hide whips to keep up 1HS<br/>
&gt; and use for stunning casters.  Lately, I have been<br/>
&gt; using the shard in my<br/>
&gt; primary hand and the whip in my off hand - fun to<br/>
&gt; burn and stun at the same<br/>
&gt; time - that&#39;s when I use weapons at all as my melee<br/>
&gt; does not compare(as we<br/>
&gt; all know).  I really want to upgrade my cloak and<br/>
&gt; maybe my neck, but if you<br/>
&gt; have other suggestions for my other slots, please<br/>
&gt; share them with me(face<br/>
&gt; WILL be the mask one day).  Include your opinion of<br/>
&gt; ball park value(I know<br/>
&gt; it varies server to server) and where I could find<br/>
&gt; it if I just traveled<br/>
&gt; there(assuming I can camp there or maybe I can do it<br/>
&gt; in my future) and any<br/>
&gt; stats you can remember.  Again, thanks in advance.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; i just got my tamborine last night and i must say im<br/>
&gt; a happy camper, it gave<br/>
&gt; me 2 pixels in level 40! that and i handed in 56<br/>
&gt; drolvarg fangs at the same<br/>
&gt; time, so i got 3 pixels for all of that stuff,<br/>
&gt; needless to say i was happy<br/>
&gt; the bloody captain was finally where he was supposed<br/>
&gt; to be. I had a spare<br/>
&gt; dalnir coin which i gave to another guy i was<br/>
&gt; grouped with which hadnt<br/>
&gt; started getting his coins, i think he will now...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Hmmm... went by Allakhazam&#39;s and they have no info<br/>
&gt; on the quest... how<br/>
&gt; &gt; odd.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First thing&#39;s first, you must get a Star of Odus<br/>
&gt; (buy it) from the jewelry<br/>
&gt; &gt; shop in Erudin.  Turn it in to the *MALE* banker<br/>
&gt; in FV.  He will then give<br/>
&gt; &gt; you a 6-slot container with a combine button for<br/>
&gt; the coins.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since you already have the ones from Dalnir&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; Kaesora, we&#39;ll skip<br/>
&gt; &gt; those.<br/>
&gt; &gt; City of Mist- One drops from the Captian of the<br/>
&gt; Watch (or something like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, I lost my detailed list :o/ )<br/>
&gt; &gt; Emerald Jungle- Must be Foraged for.  Grab a<br/>
&gt; nearby druid and exchange a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lil<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana for the foraging ;o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake of Ill Omen- The Bloodgill gobbies in the<br/>
&gt; lake (look at the base of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pillars around the center of the lake) carry<br/>
&gt; these, and are probably the<br/>
&gt; &gt; toughest creatures you&#39;ll have to fight in this<br/>
&gt; quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Overthere-  Check out the big pit in the<br/>
&gt; center of the zone and kill a<br/>
&gt; &gt; scorpoid (can&#39;t remember the exact name, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the rarer of the two<br/>
&gt; &gt; kinds<br/>
&gt; &gt; of scorpions in the pit).<br/>
&gt; &gt; -all of these coins are fairly common drops-<br/>
&gt; &gt; Put them in the box the banker gave you, hit<br/>
&gt; combine (now it looks like a<br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure chest), give it to him, and Voila!  you<br/>
&gt; have a Nostrolo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tamborine<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and you will notice the difference IMMEDIATELY).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; NOTE:  Make *SURE* you have an empty spot in you<br/>
&gt; general inventory for<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; he gives you the box for the gem (not sure about<br/>
&gt; the tamborine, but always<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good idea).  If your inventory slots are full, you<br/>
&gt; will get the &quot;dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ground message&quot; but the box will be gone (ie:<br/>
&gt; time to head back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Erudin again).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Enjoy!<br/>
