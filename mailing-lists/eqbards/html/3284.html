<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476048016">I KNOW why only some classes can bind - and I have no problem with that,<br/>
even though ours is not one of them, that is not the question.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is WHY can&#39;t someone bind me anywhere THEY can be bound?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah - I can run really fast - a trip across 5 zones shouldn&#39;t bother<br/>
me, well, guess what, it does.<br/>
<br/>
I would do a WHOLE LOT MORE adventuring in places I&#39;m very likely to die,<br/>
if I could have a friendly caster bind me in the entrance - one of the<br/>
things I hate worse about this - is having to spend an inordinate time<br/>
running (and zoning) back, just to reclaim my corpse.<br/>
<br/>
The mage in the group - they bind themselves at the zone - they are back in<br/>
the action in 2 shakes.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way.<br/>
<br/>
When you res - naked and weaponless, not only is the trip back usually<br/>
alone, I consider it wasted time.<br/>
<br/>
A mage dieing - they have their most powerful defense and offense with<br/>
them, their spells.<br/>
<br/>
A monk dieing - they are their most powerful weapon, they have a better<br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
A warrior dieing - they are really, really dependent on what&#39;s laying in<br/>
that husk a few zones away.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, we are somewhere in between all the classes, yes we have our<br/>
songs - and we can outrun critters, but just our songs alone aren&#39;t likely<br/>
to be enough to take down anything powerful enough to really want to molest<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don&#39;t mind so much not being able to bind MYSELF - but if that<br/>
magic user can bind HIMSELF there, why can&#39;t he bind me?</div>
