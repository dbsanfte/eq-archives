<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785003116">This is about the coolest thing thats happened to me in a while. At the festival on Fennin Ro, I saw aradune! He was standing there and watching the tourney going on. I think the coolest thing by far was the fact that I talked to him, and he answered me back. Anyone else on Fennin Ro that saw him? Well I just thought Id add that cause I thought that it was pretty cool.<br/>
