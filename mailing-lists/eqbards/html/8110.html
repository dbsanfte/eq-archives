PPS. Twinking is a reality of my life. You see, sisters give things to each<br/>
other. Of course, we&#39;d probably kill that bard on sight.. (look, I can RP by<br/>
myself! :) BUT -- think about how it makes the REAL newbies feel. They are<br/>
stuck with cloth, and you have your chintin shield, blackened armor.. sure<br/>
they don&#39;t know the stats, but they sure don&#39;t feel good. Half the people I<br/>
group with are twinks, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
PPS Looking for a guild for my bard! Can&#39;t compose, so I guess Soerbaird is<br/>
out..<br/>
<br/>
PPS. Don&#39;t you wish EQ was so realistic that you could assume any confusing<br/>
things were a result of you not understanding? As in,<br/>
