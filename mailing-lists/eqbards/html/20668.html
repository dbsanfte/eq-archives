<div id="ygrps-yiv-755842857">Again - I found this to be the exact opposite.  The K7V Motherboard runs on<br/>
the VIA KX133.  Never had a single solitary problem.  Note that I upgraded<br/>
the BIOS and the VIA Drivers before passing go and collecting $200.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another issue to factor in is that the GeForce2 GTS has problems with Via<br/>
chipsey motherboards (in my experience).  This mean that most people using<br/>
Athlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>
GTS.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds about right - Athlons and Via are not good bedfellows.  I&#39;ve got a<br/>
GeForce DDR on a P3V4X mobo (Via Apollo Pro) with a P3-800 and it runs<br/>
without problems.  There&#39;s not much to choose from a GeForce DDR and a<br/>
GeForce2 GTS at lower resolutions (anthing less than 1024x768).  I also<br/>
tried a GTS on the same motherboard for a week and it ran without problems.</div>
