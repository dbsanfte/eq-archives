<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372386073">I can sympathize with you because I am finding myself in the same situation.<br/>
Since I made 22d level a few weeks back, I have died more times since then<br/>
than I did from 18-22 combined (at least it seems that way).  I made 23d<br/>
level a week ago. Since then, I have died and gone back to 22d level three<br/>
times. Finally made it back to 23d yesterday but my progress towards 24th<br/>
level is going extremely slow.  Its like taking two steps backward for every<br/>
one step forward.  My tactics, gained from reading this list, haven&#39;t<br/>
changed so it has to be something else.  A couple of times my death has been<br/>
due to being in a bad group.  One time it was strictly my fault.  I made the<br/>
mistake of playing Denon&#39;s in the basement of HighKeep.  I wasn&#39;t getting<br/>
any messages that people were casting so I didn&#39;t think the z-axis bug would<br/>
affect me.  That was a bad assumption and I got killed by the guards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think soloing may be good for me for the time being.<br/>
Someone mentioned soloing the aviaks in Rathe Mountains as an option.  Does<br/>
anyone have any other recommendations?<br/>

&gt; at my level (24)?<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any tactical suggestions to permit me to keep my butt<br/>
&gt; alive when grouped with mediocre <br/>
&gt; players?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate playing for eight hours and earning only one bubble of experience.<br/>
&gt; Or less.<br/>
