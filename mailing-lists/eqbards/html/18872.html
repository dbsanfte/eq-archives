<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240775607">1.  Bards are a Plate class.  We were designed that way as part of the basic class balancing.  It&#39;s part<br/>
of our compensation for getting hit a bunch, our lousy defensive skills, our low hit points and our<br/>
experience penalty.<br/>
2.  Rangers are a Chain class.<br/>
3.  Our new armor AC is at least 3 points lower than all other new plate armor.<br/>
4.  Our new armor AC is identical to new chain armor.<br/>
5.  All armor has spell effects.<br/>
6.  Nobody can possibly argue that OUR spell effects are so superior that it warrants being dropped by 3AC<br/>
per piece of armor.<br/>
<br/>
GZ&#39;s statement may reflect what Verant was thinking in determining the AC of all new armor in general, but<br/>
I think they (once again, as with Imbrued) managed to forget that we&#39;re a Plate class.  That annoys me<br/>
more than the AC itself.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding GZ&#39;s comments about the Psalms:  I&#39;m really irritated by this, too.  I (and I&#39;m willing to bet<br/>
many of you) have been /bugging this for several months.  It&#39;s been included in numerous large threads on<br/>
the gameplay board on Sony&#39;s EQ site, again for several months.  And his reply indicates that he has only<br/>
a vague passing acquaintence with the issue.  How can he be that unaware of the problem?  There really<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be ANY reliable way to get them to understand that a bug exists.  It seems you just have<br/>
to keep telling them over (and over and over and over...) until one day they just happen to notice one of<br/>
the complaints.  It&#39;s really lousy Customer Service (as if that&#39;s a surprise).<br/>

&gt; You have to realize: A ranger is more of a tank than a Bard is. It was,<br/>
&gt; I believe, intended to be that way. RAngers get taunt. Bards do not. (well,<br/>
&gt; our songs) </span></blockquote></div>
