&gt;Huh? I don&#39;t know about this.  I have hunted here quite a bit (100 hours?).<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve never seen a mob smart enough to DoT himself.<br/>

&gt;On a side note I have seen a lot of mobs that I couldn&#39;t mez after Tash and<br/>
&gt;I am not a bard expert by any stretch of the word, I play an Enchanter, so I<br/>
&gt;am not sure of the name of the spell you use says something about &quot;xxxxx<br/>
&gt;hair stands on end&quot;.  This spell REALLY helps alot.  I would have the bard<br/>
&gt;use this first before the argo change to tashania , why  not he was meleeing<br/>
&gt;anyways, and I could slow without having to cast Tashania and get myself<br/>
&gt;beat down.  Then I could tashania after it was slowed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s Fulfil&#39;s Curtailing Chant which does DOT as well as lowering MR. So <br/>
while this will help get your inital spells to stick, it&#39;s definitely not <br/>
something a bard should use on a mob that you intend to mez unless you wait <br/>
for it to wear off (about 18 secs)<br/>
