&gt; How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>

&gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The tentacle whip is a good starter magical weapon, that&#39;s<br/>
about it.  I suppose if you were grouped with a druid who<br/>
could put a damage shield on you, and you played Hymn during<br/>
your battles, you could use the whip&#39;s lifetap effect to<br/>
extend combat long enough that the monster mostly kills itself<br/>
trying to hurt you.  But the frequency with which it procs is<br/>
not great enough to offset the low damage ratio.<br/>
