<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049134566">You make good points - my argument is not about what is &#39;fair&#39; or &#39;right&#39; -<br/>
my point is there is much that you can&#39;t control and the wide variety of<br/>
what is possible makes the game open, creative and interesting.  Life is not<br/>
totally fair as you aptly illustrate - neither is this game. You can burn<br/>
mana worrying about this stuff or you can look for the next adventure.  <br/>

that can be<br/>

commands for their<br/>

entertaining, but<br/>
		the rest of the people on the server or in the zone couldn&#39;t<br/>
care less and<br/>

awhile trying to<br/>
		move up the ladder and then someone that had just started a<br/>
few days ago got<br/>
		a position (or the window desk you wanted, or better pay or<br/>
whatever) higher<br/>
		up than you just because their friend was influential with<br/>
the upper-ups -<br/>
		would it bother you?</div>
