<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002967658">Pardon my cynicism (but it&#39;s hard not) - but despite all the good points<br/>
raised - Abashi made one or two namby-pamby response.  I get the feeling he<br/>
wanted all our comments in one place to make it easier to ignore (please<br/>
forward all comments to /dev/null...)<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the real issue here is that Verant really doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
our class because they think the fact that we don&#39;t use mana makes us<br/>
incredibly powerful.  Someone made a fantastic analysis (sorry forget who)<br/>
with a post describing &quot;Opportunity Cost&quot; - and of course - Abashi ignored<br/>
that post as well...<br/>

Great post!!<br/>
<br/>
There is a bard thread that Abashi has started (and if you haven&#39;t heard of<br/>
it yet, shame on you for not keeping up on your EQ studies ;p) on the<br/>
Gameplay forum.   Currently, it&#39;s into it&#39;s 10th page, over 350 posts (and<br/>
growing), and has yet to leave the 1st page of the forum..  Please support<br/>
the bardic community by posting there (not looking for bumps or flames, but<br/>
more discussion).<br/>
<br/>
Also, check out the latest Daily Screenshot at EQVault featuring Yours Truly<br/>
