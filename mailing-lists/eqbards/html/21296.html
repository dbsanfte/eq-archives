<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095943948">From what I know Beta isn&#39;t starting until sometime in Q1 of 2001.  Release<br/>
date isn&#39;t known.  I can&#39;t wait for it to come out.  Looks & sounds to be a<br/>
great game.<br/>

&gt;will fall through, which will be a shame based on the promise of this game.<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Official confirmation from Ester<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After having a lengthy discussion with two of the folks from Artifact<br/>
&gt;Entertainment (Horizons) over the Labor Day weekend, I can see a night and<br/>
&gt;day difference in their approach as opposed to Verant.  Both David Allen,<br/>
&gt;the president and CEO, and Doug Shuler, the art director and visual<br/>
&gt;designer, were extremely personable and open to suggestions from those in<br/>
&gt;attendance.  Having known Doug personally for several years, I am confident<br/>
&gt;this was not a put on to garner interest.  Both were praiseful of much that<br/>
&gt;Verant has accomplished, but both were also equally horrified and confused<br/>
&gt;over the way Verant treats its customers.  It was that treatment, over and<br/>
&gt;above everything else that inspired them to go out and put together a team<br/>
&gt;to make a game that was willing to treat its players the way they wanted to<br/>
&gt;see them treated.  I hope they get it right.<br/>
