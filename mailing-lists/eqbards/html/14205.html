<b>Subject:</b> Mask of Deception vs Ultravision update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094412409">So far everyone who has responded to my initial post (4 or 5 replies) has<br/>
been a half elf.  It seems that half elves have no problem and get<br/>
ultravision when they activate the DE illusion.  So far no wood elf with a<br/>
Mask has responded.  So if you are a wood elf with the Mask of Deception<br/>
please let me know if you are able to get ultravision when you activate the<br/>
illusion.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I tried it again in Ogguk.  Activated illusion and became blind<br/>
as a bat.  This time I had Psalm of Cooling memmed instead of Psalm of<br/>
Warmth.  While Cooling was up, I got ultravision.  As soon as I stop playing<br/>
I became blind as a bat again.  Faras posted that when he stopped playing<br/>
Cooling that he had to reactivate the illusion to get ultravision back.<br/>
This appears to be a bug but it doesn&#39;t affect me because I never had<br/>
ultravision in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
Both the problem I have and the one Faras mentioned appear to be bugs so I<br/>
will post a message on the EQ board and Concert Hall to try and raise<br/>
support to get it fixed.  <br/>
