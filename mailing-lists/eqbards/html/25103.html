I think you&#39;d be selling yourself short with the Tamborine.  <br/>
Depending how &quot;near-uber&quot; they are, they may have all sorts of Dragon <br/>
loot laying around unused... I think even a Selo&#39;s Drum would be too <br/>
little in exchange for this.<br/>
<br/>
It comes off King Tormax (I believe - you said you got it off an <br/>
Akanon Quest?) and EQPrices lists it for 25k (low, imo).  I&#39;d ask for <br/>
a Breath of Harmony or a Lute of the Howler.<br/>
