<div id="ygrps-yiv-159535982"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; the Crested Helm,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Very rare drop, you&#39;ll probably see 10 spaulders before the helm.<br/>
&gt;   This is a most sought after item, even by higher level people.<br/>
&gt;   The Caitliff in MM drops this, but he is an uncommon spawn, with<br/>
&gt;   a rare helm drop which equals hours and hours or camping unless<br/>
&gt;   you get lucky on the first few shots.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I guess I didn&#39;t know how lucky I was when I got mine then!  I was<br/>
camping the secret room off of the Mistmoore Graveyard for my Black Silk<br/>
Gloves and experience when the Caitliff just sauntered in and we killed him.<br/>
He had the helm and I won the roll and have been wearing it ever since: AC<br/>
10, STR 6, CHA 3, Weight 5.0.  Good bardic stuff.<br/>
