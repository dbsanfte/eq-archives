<div id="ygrps-yiv-842906421">Yeah, I soloed a warrior from 24 to 31 in LoIO, and you can get groups there at lower levels.  I was<br/>
always looking for a lower level Bard to team with (only got lucky a few times), since otherwise I had to<br/>
do the &quot;bind wounds to half and pray&quot; method.  I mostly hung out on the west side of the Lake (easy to get<br/>
single pulls there, take them to the lake shore, just about nothing ever wanders by) and in the Sarnak<br/>
Fortress (needs a group, but fun and lots of stuff to pull).<br/>
