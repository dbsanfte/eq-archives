<div id="ygrps-yiv-855596645">A great story!  My main gripe is that lower level bards without fear have no<br/>
battle of their own to wage.  At higher levels there are lots more options<br/>
but at 15-18 you don&#39;t have much that can disrupt the smashing power of a<br/>
melee mob or player.  Any suggestions other than trying to kite it which<br/>
won&#39;t work if I&#39;m trying to tank obviously.<br/>

     Not too long ago my guild celebrated it&#39;s first member to hit the big<br/>
50.  During this shindig, a lot of duels took place.  The most interesting<br/>
one (no ego here ;p) was the hour-long (yes, it took 1 hour) epic battle<br/>
between yours truly and a ranger friend (We were both level 27).<br/>
<br/>
     What made the fight last so long?  Well, in the early part of it, I<br/>
quickly realized that I was fighting his battle.  He would snare me as I<br/>
chased after him, then get far enough away as turn around, and walk<br/>
backwards as riddled me with arrows, re-snare (which I seemed to NEVER be<br/>
able to resist, unlike he and Chains :o/  ), then do it all over again.  As<br/>
I was almost halfway to having to loot my corpse, I had a nifty thought: why<br/>
don&#39;t I make him fight MY battle instead?<br/>
<br/>
     First thing I had to do was to nullify his ability to puncture me at<br/>
obscene distances (out-of-sight, as a matter of fact) with that damned<br/>
bow-and-arrows of his.  Luckily we were fighting in the newb hunting area in<br/>
East Freeport, so I ducked into a tent that was facing the wall.  Problem<br/>
solved.<br/>
<br/>
     Next, I had to figure out how I was going to do tons of damage on him<br/>
while I kept my own hide intact.  Answer:  When he came charging into the<br/>
tent (because I wouldn&#39;t come out :oP ) I would begin melee&#39;ing him while<br/>
nailing him with DoT&#39;s, then Fear him away while I healed back up.  I tried<br/>
a few times to just fear him and run behind him and hit, but he had this<br/>
annoying habit of simply disappearing and re-appearing somewhere else (Ever<br/>
see a hill giant do that while he&#39;s coming towards you?  Very<br/>
disconcerting).  I may have been able to finish him off that way, but the<br/>
time he ran straight at the guards as I was re-firing Screech made me<br/>
re-think it a bit.  Finally, after a loooong back-and-forth battle, the<br/>
difference was made when he put on his Savant&#39;s Cap.  That little bit of<br/>
extra Wisdom helpped make his PGT a proc&#39;ing machine.  That coupled with the<br/>
lowered dmg DoT&#39;s do in PvP now spelled the end for me (No, I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
PGT or anyother nifty proc&#39;ing eapon... but I do now :oP ), but not before I<br/>
took a big chunk out of his hide.  He finally beat me with less than a<br/>
bubble of health himself.  Damn what a fight!<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story?  Use everything possible to make your adversary fight<br/>
the battle YOU want, not the one they want.  Even if you don&#39;t win, they&#39;ll<br/>
gain an immense amount of respect for bards as a class.<br/>
