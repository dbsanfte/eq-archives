<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806574888">I love Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.  I came to appreciate the song when I<br/>
decided to stay a bit while traveling through Blackburrow.  I went down to<br/>
the foot of the entrance, the place where all the trains seem to converge,<br/>
and wielded my horn.  I have a few faction problems in Qeynos (O killing<br/>
some ridiculous holy fish in my quest for newer and better booze) so I<br/>
figured I would just injure as much as possible in order to regain some<br/>
factions.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up destroying mostly everything in sight, no matter warriors beat on<br/>
the disgusting little creatures, I got the kills.<br/>
<br/>
Some guy doing a gay little dance, braying his horn, and the bodies<br/>
literally began to pile up.  The trains kept coming, and the horn kept<br/>
playing and a gal said &quot;All I can say is WOW.&quot;  And then just a &quot;???&quot;  I<br/>
flashed her a smile, licked my lips, and played on.  They would try and<br/>
flee, but the damage over time effect meant the gnolls just limped off to<br/>
some quiet little corner to vibrate one last time and die.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, my level is too high for most of the beasts O the place, but it<br/>
gave me a feel for how powerful this song can be with an instrument.  There<br/>
is absolutely no way I could do as much damage as I did with Disruptive<br/>
Discord (though the song spreads the greater damage around).  And don&#39;t<br/>
forget the AC reduction bonus!<br/>
<br/>
I used it recently in Permafrost, with another bard in our group.  She<br/>
wielded her whips and sang Anthem, I would play my horn and swap to my lute<br/>
for Hymn occasionally.  Most of the goblins in there did -not- attack me,<br/>
but sporadically!<br/>
