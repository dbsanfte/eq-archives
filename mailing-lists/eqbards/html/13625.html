<div id="ygrps-yiv-614094854">I was in Sol A last night camping the foreman and predator to try and get<br/>
either an obsidian scimitar or shard (got the shard).  At 32d level, almost<br/>
all the regular spawns in those two rooms conned green to me.  I got chains<br/>
to stick around 75% of the time against the green mobs.  I would say that if<br/>
you don&#39;t have a ranger or druid to cast ensnare,  it would take a bard in<br/>
their high 20s to reliably chain goblins in the initial portions of Sol A.  <br/>
