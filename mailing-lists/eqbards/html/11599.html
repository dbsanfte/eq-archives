&gt; The ONLY problem with the PGT is that IF a mob hits you (and they will<br/>
&gt; since you have such poor agility) for more than the shield, the damage<br/>
&gt; comes thru. So if you are fighting any mob that can hit for more than<br/>
&gt; the ammount of the shield, they get one free hit, and then your agility<br/>
&gt; returns to normal<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The shield is for X hp, where X is random.  The damage it<br/>
absorbs is subtracted from X, until X drops below 0.  The<br/>
amount that X drops below 0 is applied as damage to you.  So<br/>
it doesn&#39;t really matter how much damage a mob can hit for -<br/>
the last hit will always get through to damage you (unless it<br/>
does *exactly* the amount of damage remaining on the shield),<br/>
and since it was applied with your lowered AGI (and thus lower<br/>
AC), it will be for a lot of damage.<br/>
<br/>
As you get to higher level mobs that do more damage per hit,<br/>
the extra damage due to this final hit starts to approach the<br/>
amount of damage the shield absorbs, thus limiting the PGT&#39;s<br/>
usefulness.<br/>
<br/>
I think the PGT also overwrites higher level rune spells,<br/>
which is bad if your enchanter just happened to cast one on<br/>
you (they are equivalent to heal spells, but cast before<br/>
damage is applied instead of after - very handy in a tight<br/>
spot).<br/>
