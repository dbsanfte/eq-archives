&gt;remember my average ping is around 500-600?  I take about 2 minutes to zone<br/>
&gt;max, but 15 to cross W Karana alone.  I definitely can&#39;t run from docks to<br/>
&gt;Kaladim in anywhere near one minute, but will time it tonite to be sure as<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s where I&#39;m headed anyhow.  I suspect more like three minutes though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Berthold would like you to know that it took him 1 hour and 15 minutes to<br/>
go from Steamfont to High Hold Pass last night.  This is without any speed<br/>
enhancing spells, and the only magic used was gate and invisibility (gate<br/>
returned him from the Keep to Steamfont.)  This included several side-trips<br/>
to play Mr. Postman on the Bardic FedEx quests., which, btw, netted about 2<br/>
plat.  Cheap night.<br/>
Keep in mind that he knew exactly where he was going, didn&#39;t have to wait<br/>
more than 5 minutes for the boat, and had no zone-crashes.  <br/>
Average zone-time seemed a bit longer than others, but maybe that&#39;s just<br/>
subjective.<br/>
