<div id="ygrps-yiv-384164874">Nice recommendation about EQ Diva.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found Charm Kiting to be pretty fast exp and loot depending on what <br/>
you are kiting. Any type of kiting, however, is carpal tunnel enducing. <br/>
Druids get a break while they med. No such luck for the bard, who&#39;s very <br/>
short downtime means you are constantly at work. Not too bad if you never <br/>
want to be bored, but it is hard on the fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get your charm song, you can solo more efficiently than chant <br/>
kiting. The learning curve on charm kiting, though, is a bit steeper. <br/>
Expect to die while you learn your timing and be prepared to zone when you <br/>
get too low on health.<br/>

&gt;it has guides discussing<br/>
&gt;soloing. The biggest thing is that it is very slow. Here&#39;s my off the cuff <br/>
&gt;thoughts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Chant Kiting is draining because you&#39;re generally twisting while running <br/>
&gt;around in a circle. SOW<br/>
&gt;potions or buffs speed it up if you can sing 3 DOT songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fear Kiting is harder because you have to stay on the mob, get few resists <br/>
&gt;and stay away from<br/>
&gt;wanderers. I found it comes down to location (where the mob doesn&#39;t run <br/>
&gt;far and roames don&#39;t crash<br/>
&gt;the party). That and being able to twist in regen after you get resisted <br/>
&gt;and beaten up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Charm Kiting is very very fun. Again, location is important. I only do it <br/>
&gt;outside and BW was a<br/>
&gt;favorite of mine. However, I was mightily impressed by a Bard ~52nd when I <br/>
&gt;was in my 40&#39;s that<br/>
&gt;solo&#39;d the Bar in SkyShrine. He snared two, ran to the zone-out, charmed <br/>
&gt;one until the other was<br/>
&gt;dead and then zoned out. Too risky for me, but he did quite well in the <br/>
&gt;train-free time I watched.<br/>
&gt;I stuck with the raptors outside :-).<br/>

&gt;OK, gonna drop the beans here and admit it, I suck at soloing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to be versatile and be able to do all the class can do (which in our<br/>
&gt;case is a whole lot)... so..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Am currently 37, was going to wait to solo until I got chant of<br/>
&gt;flame...  but maybe I can get 38 in EW?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have MM drums and decent equipment, but nothing outrageous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you solo there and what techniques, I&#39;m very veyr interested.  My<br/>
&gt;wife&#39;s sick to death of OT and is going to drag her warrior over to velious<br/>
&gt;soon, so thought this would be very pertinent info for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks ahead of time,<br/>
