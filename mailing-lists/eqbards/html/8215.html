<div id="ygrps-yiv-857437165"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The low cost of other magic weapons like the dirk disaster was what<br/>
&gt;caused wisps to be nerfed even further in their loot with no save<br/>
&gt;lightstones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, that&#39;s not why the Burned Out Lightstones were implemented. The<br/>
occurance of Greater Lightstones and Lightstones on wisps is unchanged, but<br/>
instead of getting nothing (which is what used to happen) you will now get a<br/>
Burned Out Lightstone.<br/>
<br/>
The reason they did this is so that ALL wisps have a lightsource - so you<br/>
can no longer tell by how much light they were giving off whether they had a<br/>
lightstone or not. (It used to be that you could run around killing ONLY the<br/>
wisps that gave off light, and would be assured of a lightstone each time.<br/>
Now you must kill em all and taken your chances.)<br/>
