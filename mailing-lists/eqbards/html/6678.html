<div id="ygrps-yiv-569541608">One way we have been nerf&#39;ed is with the DoT changes in the last patch.  For <br/>
all other DoT users the change was only bad if you kited, if you used DoT&#39;s <br/>
in a normal group situation they were upgraded slightly due to the extra <br/>
tick of damage. Our DoT songs did not get the extra tick of damage, but are <br/>
subject to the damage decrease if the mob runs toward the bard when damage <br/>
is applied.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But the fact is in the EQ world we are becoming woefully underpowered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I disagree, I have yet to see some manner in which I am &quot;underpowered&quot; I do<br/>
&gt;okay solo (once I figured out how) I do over 1000pts damage in 36 seconds<br/>
&gt;(on a pull of 5 mobs) I give our group a major decrease in down time. I am<br/>
&gt;just not seeing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;Case in point the new SOW problem, the Z-axis bug, and there are more.  The<br/>
&gt;fact is I love being a bard because of WHAT a bard is.. not because of what<br/>
&gt;Verant made the bard.  It is evident that bards are being treated as a<br/>
&gt;second class, class.  What other class has had their spell deliberatly<br/>
&gt;placed as lesser value?  Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW overpowering<br/>
&gt;Accel was not an accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh pshaw, it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;s clearly a bug. They have a poorly modeled speed<br/>
&gt;data structure and they keep tweeking it (I can almost visualize it now<br/>
&gt;after all these changes). It&#39;s broke, it will be fixed. Petition it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;see some more special items for bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;agreed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;.  I&#39;d like to see some more useful songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;I have to figure out all th euses for the songs I have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing us without reguard to the results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have yet to see proof it is an intentional nerf. As I said, petition it.<br/>
