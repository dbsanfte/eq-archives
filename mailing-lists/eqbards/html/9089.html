<b>Subject:</b> A bardic chef whips up some karma <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-664999391">This isn&#39;t strictly Bardic, but I think it&#39;s in character for bards to be<br/>
social chefs, so...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been getting my cooking skills up (currently 61) and carrying around a<br/>
little spit.  Since I&#39;ve been singing a lot in Cazic-Thule I&#39;ve been<br/>
whipping up batches of Beer Braised Gator and Lizard-On-A-Stick for my<br/>
groupmates.  Since I am in pickup groups a lot this sometimes really freaks<br/>
people out!  It&#39;s amazing that many poeple are completely unaware that you<br/>
can cook all of these meats that you so often destroy.<br/>
<br/>
A female rogue that I was grouping with got a real kick out of my handing<br/>
her a couple of Beer Braised Gator steaks when we were fighting the tough<br/>
little alligators.  After a particularly nasty fight in which the gator just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t taunt off of her and took her down to one bubble, she looted the<br/>
gator, gave me the meat and said &quot;Cook this one for me.  I&#39;m eating his<br/>
ass.&quot;  She then proceded to put those steaks first in line in her inventory.<br/>
&quot;Virtual payback&quot;!<br/>
