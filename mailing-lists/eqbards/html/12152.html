<b>Subject:</b> 1st Impression of Paw <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-475981683">Greetings!<br/>
Spent a whole night in the new Paw, and thought I would share my experiences <br/>
with everyone.  I was only in the old Paw twice, so I had a sketchy idea of <br/>
it (not like some folks who know it inside out).  The first thing i noticed, <br/>
was that the layout of the dungeon is awkward for more than two groups to <br/>
use in the first section.  The first section is what I consider to be up to <br/>
the double doors.  There are 2 places to setup a base, one being much safer <br/>
as it is off the main tunnel to the zone.  The gnolls are linked was the <br/>
second thing I noticed.  Attack a certain one and you may get 3.  Even if <br/>
the other 2 were out of sight.  There is a low level caster in the 1st <br/>
portion that casts fear and charm( I tore up a tank with anthem locked on <br/>
and 2 fast weapons).<br/>
<br/>
Personally I did not like this new Paw.  If I were in the low 30&#39;s then I <br/>
would probably like it more.  The trains are frequent.  There is poor to <br/>
mediocre exp, there isn&#39;t much room for several groups and it is confusing <br/>
sometimes when a group is pulling or training because of the linked mobs.  <br/>
Our group would not help unless we heard a train shout.<br/>
<br/>
What I like about it is that it is a refreshing break from the populated <br/>
zones.  It is so nice (for me) not to see ooc and shouts constantly flowing. <br/>
  The loot is fair, and if you don&#39;t die then the exp bar will move (but <br/>
slowly like I said for over 35).  On the whole I like it better than the new <br/>
Kithicor.  Kith seemed like too much work for too little gain.  The <br/>
challenge of Kith is much higher, so it is obviously intended for higher <br/>
levels than Paw is.  But the loot is better in Paw, mainly because Kith loot <br/>
is very poor.<br/>
<br/>
I will be going back to Paw.  It deserves another chance.  I have not <br/>
explored very far, and with a full party we may have a better time.  Because <br/>
of the nature of the place I will have lullaby, lament, and pixie memmed.  <br/>
Not sure about the other songs yet.  Likely have charm memmed too...but that <br/>
is 4 crowd control type songs (did I mention trains and linked gnolls?)  An <br/>
enchanter in the group seems like an important role here.<br/>

P.S.  Am anxious for other opinions on the place.  Please tell me I am way <br/>
off base with my perception!  I really want to like it there.</div>
