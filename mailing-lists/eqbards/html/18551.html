<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810515495">They&#39;re the most powerful guild on Veeshan. Because of this, your question <br/>
will most likely be answered with the typical: They&#39;re powergaming losers, <br/>
they KS and train people hourly and on purpose, they have GM&#39;s in their back <br/>
pockets, they take over zones and push everyone else out, they perma-camp <br/>
spawns by rotating people in and out to keep someone on the spot, they&#39;re <br/>
all arrogant egotistical pricks (a couple are, but every guild has those), <br/>
they&#39;re all kewld00ds that don&#39;t give a shit about role-playing (some are <br/>
some aren&#39;t, same as any other guild), they farm items to e-bay them <br/>
(LAFFFF), and they own all dragons/planes. The funny thing is none of that <br/>
is true, but people tend to belive whatever they read, and the best form of <br/>
publicity in an online game is word of mouth, so...<br/>
<br/>
Usually, the Veeshan forum on eqvault is spammed and trolled with flames <br/>
stating one or more of the above items, and the person gets shot down, <br/>
but...they keep it coming.<br/>
<br/>
I know enough about them (being former-FoH myself) to know that they aren&#39;t <br/>
deserving of all of the flames, but it happens anyways.<br/>

&gt;FoH?  Not familiar with them, but then again the people I associate with <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;definitely on the &#39;game&#39; end.  Who or what is FoH?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Kit<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That ranger is a character, not a player.  About 5 people played it 24/7 to<br/>
&gt;get it to 60 that fast.  He&#39;s a member of FoH... need I say more?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not a game... it&#39;s a business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At least to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
