<div id="ygrps-yiv-571695759">I&#39;m definitely in, but I can only do weekends.  Possibly we could find a<br/>
guild that would herd us around and keep us alive while we confused the hell<br/>
out of half of Norrath.  Please come up with a time and date (preferably<br/>
Sunday) and we&#39;ll all have a blast!   Perhaps a sheep motif would be in<br/>
order, could be like a cattle drive.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m in, refresh my memory when it is supposed to happen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which server, what time, etc, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe a lot of people missed it due to high list activity yesterday, if<br/>
&gt; so here&#39;s a report. So far I hadn&#39;t got as far as picking a server or<br/>
&gt; time/date. My initial post was just floating a balloon to see if anyone<br/>
&gt; was interested. As to server/time, if there&#39;s enough interest, I will<br/>
&gt; try to coordinate a time that is most convenient to all who want to<br/>
&gt; attend. Server wise, if someone is in a guild that would like to host<br/>
&gt; the event and provide lemming support (binding, resses for gnomes that<br/>
&gt; die along the way, etc, we will hold it there, otherwise, I&#39;ll just pick<br/>
&gt; one of the lesser used servers (heh, maybe a race war server)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the original post.<br/>

&gt; I was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>
&gt; to be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>
&gt; we couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>
&gt; visiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>
&gt; something silly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>
&gt; naked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>
&gt; think borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>
&gt; called the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>
&gt; gnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>
&gt; up to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>
&gt; molten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>
&gt; derivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone interested? How many people are on the list now? Maybe we should<br/>
&gt; put up a poll to see who would come.<br/>
