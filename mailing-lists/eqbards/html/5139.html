&gt; &gt;Very strange indeed.  I may miss a note here and there, but not much.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have absolutely no problem getting my songs started.  Can&#39;t remember offhand<br/>
&gt; &gt;the exact number, but my dexterity is around 110 or so.  I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt;dexterity plays a bigger role in getting a song up and running, rather than<br/>
&gt; &gt;charisma.  If everyone else has good dexterity and experiences this problem<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am mystified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dex of 106, and I have to try at LEAST 5 times to get Carrilon going.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The question is, how often have you played the Carrilon?  I have close to the<br/>
same dexterity as you, 110, and I never miss when starting the Carrilon, at least<br/>
not lately.  I know when I first got the song, I used to miss quite a bit, but<br/>
that&#39;s like any song, the first while after you get it are murder for getting it<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
I have used the Carrilon a LOT, between my smithing and buying steel plate and<br/>
getting oddball quests.  I think that&#39;s a factor that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>
