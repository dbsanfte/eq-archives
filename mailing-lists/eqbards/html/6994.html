<div id="ygrps-yiv-891882894">Lowering deviation from average however, does increase predictability which<br/>
means less dying.  The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less from mobs you<br/>
have easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon you&#39;ll<br/>
sometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly trounced by the<br/>
same white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the best defense<br/>
against clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in a row with my<br/>
Dirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times anyway.<br/>
Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>
straght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight hits are as<br/>
advantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of predictability<br/>
that kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I don&#39;t get bad luck,<br/>
whereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you can handle and<br/>
can&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>

I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>
likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>
deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>

I agreed with John here.  The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>
weapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>
Silver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>
and the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.  I<br/>
have no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>
seems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>
Same mob at same lvl.<br/>
