&gt;   I think this statement pretty much sums up everything that I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;   come up with:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   While the bard class itself is nicely balanced, it has and <br/>
&gt; is lacking<br/>
&gt;   attention during times when Verant continually adjusts <br/>
&gt; other classes&#39;<br/>
&gt;   abilities.  This will inevitably impact bards as their songs are <br/>
&gt;   derived from the essence of other classes&#39; traits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t feel underpowered, (yeah I&#39;ve got a broken song or two,<br/>
&gt;   not to mention the handful of missing songs) but I am severely<br/>
&gt;   overlooked in the grand scheme of things as a bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gee, with everything I&#39;ve read leately you&#39;d think we all have a complex<br/>
about our class. I was in Mistmoore the other night when a Rogue asked to<br/>
join a group of people who were 8 levels below him. When they replied, &quot;Gee,<br/>
don&#39;t you think you&#39;re a little high for this group?&quot; he replied, &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>
Rogue, subtract 4 levels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think out of all the classes that really are screwed up, Rogues would get<br/>
my vote. I haven&#39;t had one in a group I&#39;ve been in for a real long time now.<br/>
They do get backstab and recently got poison, but most of their skills are<br/>
not useful. They&#39;d be more fun from a roleplaying perspective, but this<br/>
isn&#39;t really much of a roleplaying type of game. For better roleplaying,<br/>
you&#39;d only be able to do quests once, and probably have to do them in a<br/>
certain sequence to play out the &quot;story&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty happy with the bard. Doesn&#39;t sound as much fun at the higher end<br/>
of the spectrum on the Dragon/Planes raids playing just the buffing songs as<br/>
at my level a bard really can fill in where ever he&#39;s needed. I guess I<br/>
should be in no hurry to leave the mid 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s, eh?<br/>
