<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610088216">A couple of other things to consider.  If servers only allow 49 & 50 level<br/>
players to go on dragon raids, then how are the 40-48 level people ever<br/>
gonna learn how to do it?  <br/>
<br/>
From reading posts on the E&#39;ci message boards, I know they prefer higher<br/>
level characters (due to dragon fear), but for bards they make exceptions.<br/>
The only time a 40-48 bard would get passed over was if there were plenty of<br/>
49/50 bards already on hand.  <br/>

&gt; other, work well together, and are balanced good for a dragon raid.  takes<br/>
&gt; time and practice, and you&#39;ll get there.<br/>
