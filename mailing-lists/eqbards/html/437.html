I became curious about the effects of the gods&#39; recent tinkering on the worlds (ooc: particularly the &quot;several quest and combat exploits have been fixed&quot; part!).  Since I was on Faydwer, I slew a few spiderlings (feeling like a bully all the while) and went to my home city of Kelethin to visit the guild.  The spiderling silk quest often discussed on this list is no longer lucrative.  Sylia Windlehands (guild leader of the Kelethin SongWeavers) still needs silks for lute strings, and is happy to give you a gold piece and a hand drum for your efforts.  But when you sell the drum to the guild vendor, the price is now 6s 9c (ooc: my charisma is 95, your price may vary).  This is still a terrific way to get a hand drum (or a spare), since they cost over 3gp from a vendor.  Just do not expect to get rich quickly off this quest.<br/>

Yours in Song,<br/>
