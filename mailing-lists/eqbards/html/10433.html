I tested it a day after the latest patch.  The results are at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>
<br/>
under Selo&#39;s Accelerando.  The data fit the pattern I&#39;ve come<br/>
to expect from my speed from level 20 to level 40 (the level<br/>
40 timings were the latest).  I am as fast as ever (if<br/>
anything, Verant made us slightly faster).<br/>
<br/>
I will test it again tonight or tomorrow, but this is getting<br/>
really tiring having to retest to verify that nothing has<br/>
changed any time someone thinks or claims that it&#39;s different.<br/>
If you think our speed has been nerfed, why not test it for<br/>
yourself?  All you have to do is time your normal running<br/>
speed between two fixed points, time your running speed with<br/>
Accel and a drum between the same points, and compare to my<br/>
results.  Or better yet compare to your results the last time<br/>
you did this test.  It takes just a couple minutes for those<br/>
two cases (I take longer because I test the full gamit -<br/>
running, walking, no drum, drum, Mistmoore drum, and sometimes<br/>
SoW and encumberance).<br/>
