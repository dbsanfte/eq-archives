&gt; The last time I saw this guy he was understandably upset, but swimming<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For those of you that do not know (and just click OK instead<br/>
of reading those update messages :-), a recent change allows<br/>
anyone you /consent to to drag your corpse around.  So if you<br/>
get into a tough situation like this, there&#39;s no reason to put<br/>
your main character at further risk.  Simply create a level 1<br/>
character, login with the main character and /consent to the<br/>
level 1 character, then login with the level 1 character and<br/>
go looking for the corpse.  (This assumes of course that the<br/>
degree of risk is the same searching with either character -<br/>
e.g. the sharks are red, but sparsely distributed.)<br/>
<br/>
When you find the corpse, target it, and type /corpse JoeBlow<br/>
to drag it to a safer location.  I would not recommend looting<br/>
it with the level 1 because if he should die, his corpse will<br/>
only last 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is much easier if you have a high level friend<br/>
you can trust and /consent to him.<br/>
