<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095939060">Destroyed from what? I have dropped mine several times and just picked them<br/>
up again off the ground. Either someone grabbed them after you dropped them,<br/>
or you just couldnt see the tiny icon on the ground, and it is a really<br/>
small icon. Try to find it in a dark dungeon while some enraged Zol Knight<br/>
is whackin you upside the head.<br/>

My female half-elf Bard (Crier on Fennin Ro) has leveled up to 18th so much<br/>
faster than my monk did (monk&#39;s 24th) it&#39;s kind of disappointing.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want the fun of being a Bard to run out so quickly!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started numerous characters and have had the most fun being the Bard<br/>
without question.  The only character that was almost as much &quot;raw fun&quot; was<br/>
the Troll Shadowknight that I played up to level 5 and deleted (I was<br/>
spreading myself too thin over too many characters).  I figure in two months<br/>
when my Bard is 50th and the Plane of Fear is getting old (sarcasm) I think<br/>
I&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>
<br/>
The only stressful thing about being a Bard is dropping things through the<br/>
cracks in the Inventory slots moved to the hotkeys.  I dropped a set of<br/>
Bladed<br/>
Thulian Claws the other night and they&#39;re LORE.  They were destroyed before<br/>
they hit the ground - 700pp flushed.  That was Saturday night and I still<br/>
haven&#39;t fully recovered from it - I was genuinely enraged at the game eating<br/>
that much time and money (substatial at level 17/18, I assure you).  My<br/>
stomach hurts when I think about it.  If anyone on Fennin Ro feels like<br/>
selling me another set (or perhaps a Silvery War Axe), please look me up.<br/>
