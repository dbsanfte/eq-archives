&gt; &gt; &gt;   A big problem I noticed that is L25-L30 people popping into lguk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   and solb, and hogging space that a higher level person should<br/>

&gt; You leveled at about the same rate as my friends did, and after asking<br/>
&gt; them to come visit me in many of the zones that they told me were swell<br/>
&gt; for getting experience, they were universally glad that they managed to<br/>
&gt; beat the crowding curve.  It may have been bad when you were coming up,<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s worse now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the end, I actually agree with you, though.  The problem stems from a<br/>
&gt; lack of stuff for high level players to do, which ought to be Verant&#39;s<br/>
&gt; first priority.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s humorous to me to hear a higher level player suggesting a low level<br/>
character is taking up space that could be better utilized by a higher level<br/>
character.  What&#39;s ironic about this is those of in the middle of the level<br/>
curve (I am level 37 now, probably in the thick of the &quot;average player&quot;)<br/>
have been dealing with overcrowding our whole lives.  Newbies areas at low<br/>
levels were packed when the players with the opportunity to play more and<br/>
level faster were moving into empty higher level areas.  By the time the<br/>
curve made it to those higher level areas, those with the time were moving<br/>
into places like Cazic, MM, Guk, Sol A.  When I was moving into Sol A, U<br/>
Guk, MM, and Cazic all these places were crowded (ever fought in MM with 2<br/>
groups in the Graveyard or CT with 3 groups sharing 4C&#39;s?!), whereas Sol B<br/>
was relatively empty.  We&#39;ve been fighting for room to play at every turn.<br/>
Finding alternative places to hunt became a must if you wanted any sort of<br/>
forward exp gain.  I don&#39;t think the fast levelers had any of these issues<br/>
until lately when the level curve caught up.  Now, since they haven&#39;t had a<br/>
chance to deal with this while growing up, it becomes a serious issue and<br/>
the lower levels are all of a sudden not allowed in a certain area?  Were<br/>
there level requirements on dungeons when the fast levelers were entering<br/>
them?  A level 30 is paying the same amount for the game as a level 50.  To<br/>
suggest that he can not go somewhere that he wants to go is absurd.  Not<br/>
only is it impossible (because there&#39;s no room) for him to take the next<br/>
step up (fighting in CT can get boring after 10 levels), he&#39;s also now not<br/>
welcome there in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should not be surprised at hearing this.  It was some of the fast<br/>
levelers that showed the same sort of behavior many months ago when talking<br/>
about the &quot;best&quot; group and which classes would not be invited into a group<br/>
because they didn&#39;t add the most bang for the buck.  This selfish attitude<br/>
surprised the average gamer then, as it surprises me now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the problem now is not having enough high level places to hunt, but<br/>
believe me, if you are level 50 or have been level 50 for awhile, you are<br/>
only just beginning to see the real problem that most of the population has<br/>
been seeing for almost a year now.  Because the underlying problem is<br/>
there&#39;s not enuf places for the curve, whichever level ranges that might<br/>
span at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for Fennin Ro to split so they can move on to splitting the<br/>
next highest servers (Xegony should be one of the top 3!).  Then I might be<br/>
able to wander into lguk and find room for 2 to join.<br/>
