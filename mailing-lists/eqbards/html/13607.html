&gt; &gt; A lot of times I wonder what it&#39;s like to play without a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the group.  :)<br/>

&gt;Not much fun, though with clarity it&#39;s bearably. In fact, I try to avoid<br/>
&gt;playing without an enchanter now. High level Bards are real rare on our<br/>
&gt;server at high levels and there&#39;s only a couple of good ones. &lt;Hi Downs&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, there are no high level bards playing because they get tired of being <br/>
treated as mana batteries by high level casters :p<br/>
<br/>
Also as a high level bard I can tell you I tire quickly of the second class <br/>
status in item lottos as well.  I got into a long discussion about this at <br/>
the last Efreeti camp I took part in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, dispite what GZ said about pixie strike not being broken, it looks<br/>
&gt;like they may have changed it recently. Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>
&gt;druid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>
&gt;basically locked me up with pixie strike. I wasn&#39;t able to move once if<br/>
&gt;I got the message and icon. This is considerably different from my tests<br/>
&gt;with the song months ago.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pixie Strike WAS changed.  It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>
When it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>
debuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>
