&gt; I don&#39;t understand how someone making something that allows you to use<br/>

all the code, art, maps, etc.  Being the owners, they dictate<br/>
what right you have to use it.  I don&#39;t see why so many of you<br/>
are having trouble understanding this.  This falls under<br/>
international copyright law - with books you own the paper and<br/>
ink, with software you own the media.  The original author(s)<br/>
owns the actual content.  Some authors are lenient about<br/>
enforcing their copyright and let you use it as you wish,<br/>
others defend it vigorously.<br/>

&gt; locally use the product that you have purchased (that you are still required<br/>
&gt; to purchase to use) when it doesn&#39;t eliminate the need for the EQ servers?<br/>
&gt; Unless I don&#39;t fully understand what the EQ emulator did, it sounds to me<br/>
&gt; like Bleem would be a precendent that would cause Verant to lose in court.<br/>
&gt; PSX hardware and EQ servers - same thing, you still have to purchase the<br/>
&gt; games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  With the PSX, Sony owned the hardware, not<br/>
the software.  With EQ, Verant owns the hardware *and* the<br/>
software.  If all the companies making PSX games decided<br/>
they were going to code it so it wouldn&#39;t work with emulators,<br/>
there wouldn&#39;t be a whole lot you could (legally) do to stop<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it this way:  If the courts decide that you can<br/>
legally use the EQ graphics on the CD any way you want, do you<br/>
think any company would be stupid enough to invest the time<br/>
and money creating art for an online game when they know their<br/>
competitors could legally just rip it off to use in other<br/>
games?<br/>
