<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I thought Radia paid 9000 pp for it, or was it 10000?  By the <br/>
&gt; way, Radia is <br/>
&gt; not a twink, she made all her fortune via <br/>
&gt; trading/buying/selling.  Last I <br/>
&gt; know she wasn&#39;t even in a guild.  So it is possible for a <br/>
&gt; non-guild twinked <br/>
&gt; character to get all those nice equipments at that level. </span></blockquote></div>
