<div id="ygrps-yiv-700673009">That reminds me, I cannot tell you how many times I get some PC (of<br/>
relatively high level even) giving me a tell when I am singing Area Affect<br/>
songs of any kind and saying things like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you trying to cast on me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your spell is not working on me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stop trying to cast on me! You are spamming my window with your spell&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I have to sit and explain how a bard&#39;s area affect songs work to another<br/>
level 20 player - do these people have no clue whatsoever about how our<br/>
class works?  It is true that many people I group with will admit right out<br/>
that they have no clue how a bard works.  I was talking to one guy and<br/>
decided to pop invisible for a laugh and then they guy says, &quot;what class are<br/>
you?&quot; in a tell because he is confused that I was a solo half-elf with metal<br/>
armor and I went invisible.<br/>
<br/>
I told one guy I am part rogue, part warrior, part cleric, part mage, part<br/>
ranger, part druid, etc...and he goes, &quot;are you crazy!?&quot; completely not wise<br/>
to the fact that we can do a little of what makes every class unique.  <br/>
<br/>
Solidarity bard brothers and sisters, we must educate the masses to our<br/>
usefulness, especially our fellow bards like the one I ran into in Unrest on<br/>
Sunday.  Here is this level 20 bard with full bronze plate and some very<br/>
very nice unique items in a group that I join up with and I don&#39;t even<br/>
realize he is a bard until I am in the group for about 15 minutes and go to<br/>
turn off the healing song and realize I am not singing it.  He is running in<br/>
and out of the house pulling green mobs (we were both the same level at the<br/>
time) and I ask him 3 times, &quot;what songs will you be singing during<br/>
battles?&quot; so I can get an idea of what I should be using to compliment him.<br/>
Finally he responds, &quot;Bellow, unless you have any requests...&quot; and runs back<br/>
into the house.  Next thing you know he is shouting &quot;zone!&quot; and runs to the<br/>
zone with a train of green monsters from the yard following him.  I thought<br/>
I should probably have attempted to educate this fellow but instead I got<br/>
disgusted with the whole absurd scene and excused myself from the group.<br/>

&gt; At level 7 playing my chords of dissonance and whacking on a <br/>
&gt; gnoll a wizard<br/>
&gt; a level higher than me tried to steal my kill but couldn&#39;t do <br/>
&gt; it :)  He got<br/>
&gt; mad because my &#39;chords&#39; were casting a spell on him.  He <br/>
&gt; tried to duel me -<br/>
&gt; I just ignored him.<br/>
