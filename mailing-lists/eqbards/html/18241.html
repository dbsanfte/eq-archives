<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251996891">Okay,  another thought...<br/>
<br/>
We know that mobs do NOT follow the same rules as PC&#39;s...<br/>
You can stack a number of both offensive and defensive effects on a<br/>
pc...(don&#39;t know if there is actually a hard limit...i&#39;ve been well into a<br/>
3rd row of icons, before...<br/>
this is a big what if...<br/>
What if you can only put X many offensive spells onto a mob...<br/>
i.e. root, dot 1, dot 2, dot 3, DD...so you have 5 effects...<br/>
now, here comes ... bellow: 6 effects...nope, can&#39;t have that...overwrite<br/>
the first one...root...<br/>
okay, root it again...6 effects, can&#39;t have that, overwrite the first one...<br/>
now, here comes chant, 6 effects, can&#39;t have that, overwrite the first<br/>
one...root...<br/>
<br/>
i am NOT saying this is how it works, but it would start to fit what you are<br/>
talking about.  Plus, this seems to be shot down by the multi-groups taking<br/>
out dragons and what not, possibly and probably not working on<br/>
uber-mobs...BUT, what if it IS taking place, but we don&#39;t realize it...then<br/>
that Necro&#39;s big DOT get&#39;s overwritten by some effect that is not nearly so<br/>
harmful...you should be getting messages if that&#39;s the case...dunno...just<br/>
supposing<br/>

&gt; No - it&#39;s not that simple.  I tested extensively.  Sometimes Bellows had<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; effect on Root.  Also - there were times when either Chant would break<br/>
root.<br/>
&gt; And other times the Chant didn&#39;t break root.  Also - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; totally random - it definitely seemed that root was broken more often when<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was singing the attack songs over &quot;just singing Mana&quot;.<br/>
