<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551082638">Greetings.  I&#39;m Thrush of Freeport in the Veeshan aspect.<br/>
<br/>
I find anomalies and frustrations in our chosen way of magic and seek<br/>
instruction from those more learned than myself.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that when I play the drum those watching see me as if I were<br/>
strumming a flute and rather than the drum I hear the sweet sounds of<br/>
strings.  Perhaps some perverse enchanter has cast a twisted illusion upon<br/>
us.  Does anyone know if perchance the great powers of magic may some day<br/>
set this straight?<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, recently I attained the 7th circle of skill and after<br/>
saving and even sacrificing a bit of personal jewelery was able to purchase<br/>
the scroll for the Whistling Warsong of the 7th circle.  Imagine my dismay<br/>
when what I thought was newfound power had less effect though concentrated<br/>
on me than the old 1st circle song with which we all start has on me and<br/>
all others in my adventuring group.  Can anyone encourage me that perhaps<br/>
some day my investment in the new song will be of some value?<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some good<br/>
and valued application?<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you.  May sweet harmony accompany your path<br/>
and Erolissi fill your life with love.<br/>
<br/>
	Thrush</div>
