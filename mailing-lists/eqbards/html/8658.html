&gt; Don&#39;t know how much anyone else has looked so far, but my search was a bust.<br/>
&gt; Killed 19 HG&#39;s and no not one had a lambent on it; at least the loot if good.<br/>
&gt;  Wouldn&#39;t have gotten one all night had it not been for someone kind enought<br/>
&gt; to toss one my way (and another for Shada from his friend :) ).<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how anyone else&#39;s luck has been, but if for every piece I go for<br/>
&gt; I have to kill 20+ HG&#39;s. It&#39;s gonna be a LONG time before I have even 2 or 3<br/>
&gt; pieces. Ah well, guess thats Verant&#39;s idea to keep me here :P<br/>

giant I saw all night that wasn&#39;t already taken, and got one stone. <br/>
This was in Rathe Mountains. 	 <br/>
What zone were you in?  All the giant-bearing zones seemed to be<br/>
particularly busy last night.<br/>
