<div id="ygrps-yiv-281826791">Ah yes, an interesting place indeed. And unless you have a very good<br/>
swimming skill the hole in the ice is a bit far away. When I was in there at<br/>
level 25 2 ice bones gave me some trouble. This was mainly cause I was<br/>
caught off guard and didn&#39;t have the right song set up. There is a small<br/>
hollow cylinder in there that I found quite interesting and was the direct<br/>
result of me being caught off guard by the skels... Let me know if anyone<br/>
can actually enter it. =)<br/>
	Ooh, they cast spells too for those who don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I went into that cave region under the Everfrost river that<br/>
8)someone else mentioned.  One goblin diver at the entrance.<br/>
8)It&#39;s dark inside so the ultravision song is handy.  It&#39;s<br/>
8)rather maze-like but very large so it isn&#39;t too bad.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
8)map the place, just wanted to see what was inside.  Mostly<br/>
8)green ice-boned skeletons.  There was one red human, looked<br/>
8)like a necromancer.  Sulan Mcboor or something like that.<br/>
8)Ready to attack, so I stayed away.  There were several more<br/>
8)passages that I didn&#39;t explore.  I&#39;ll try to map it some time.<br/>

8)If ice-bones give you good experience with little chance of<br/>
8)death, then it might be a good uncrowded area to play in.  If<br/>
8)you have to run though, or the bard dies, the rest of the<br/>
8)group is going to be in trouble since I&#39;m not sure you can<br/>
8)make the trip from the ice hole to the cave without the water<br/>
