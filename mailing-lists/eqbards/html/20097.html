<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143178013"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 30th.  A good example is last nite.  I was grouped with an <br/>
&gt; enchanter and the<br/>
&gt; spells I was twisting was Fulfil&#39;s, Hymn, and Guardian.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>With 4 tanks you could be singing:<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth<br/>
Chant of Battle<br/>
Fufils<br/>
<br/>
which would give a damage shield, AC, Dex, Str, DoT and lower the mobs<br/>
resist all while wailing away on the front line. Sounds pretty useful to me!<br/>
<br/>
hitting 32 will change a LOT, but still, there is a lot you can add to a<br/>
group before then.<br/>
