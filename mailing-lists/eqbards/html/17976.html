<div id="ygrps-yiv-400393380">I used three different times yesterday.  Once prepatch (couldn&#39;t sleep) and<br/>
twice afterwards.  All three times used it nearly continuously for over 2<br/>
hrs.  Post patch it was wearing off early on greens about 30% of the time.<br/>
Never had seen it wear off early on a green pre patch.  Will be using it<br/>
again tonite and should get more results, but it certainly looks like a nerf<br/>
to me.<br/>

This is the same question I wanted to ask the list today.  I was in <br/>
frenzied last night and I got a ton of very early wear-off messages on <br/>
this song.  I was wondering whether I had found a sour spot in my <br/>
twisting cycle (e.g., I was twisting just fast enough to get the song <br/>
starts/song stops problem) or if this was a problem with Chains itself.  <br/>
At my level, the stuff we were fighting is mostly normal blue.  The song <br/>
ought to work pretty well.<br/>
