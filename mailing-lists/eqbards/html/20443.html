<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133419664">I can&#39;t speak directly for Ill Omen - (I was already too high level when<br/>
Kunark came out) - but I haven&#39;t found anywhere in Kunark where a bard has<br/>
to worry about traveling.  With Selo&#39;s + Drum you can outrun anything.  Add<br/>
to that they &quot;Forget about you&quot; after a certain distance.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few areas where the accumulation of aggro can be a problem<br/>
(wanderer heads your way and attacks you) but that tends to the exception<br/>
not the rule.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Lake of Ill Omens contains plentiful mobs in all levels from<br/>
&gt; level 3-4 thru<br/>
&gt; 27-29.  You just have to hunt in different regions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that mobs for your level would be just to the right<br/>
&gt; of where the<br/>
&gt; river hits the lake.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm, maybe it was just a slow spawn night...that run through the<br/>
spiders/leaches is pretty scary though, yow. They ARE agro to younuns right?<br/>
Not a one attacked me but I figured I was just lucky.<br/>
