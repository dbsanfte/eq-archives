<div id="ygrps-yiv-627955975">Maybe with DSL.  It takes me 2-3 minutes just to zone and I have a 56k modem<br/>
due to having a nearly 500 ping, which Brad recently said was within the<br/>
average range (200-500).  9 zones takes 18-27 minutes just for zoning.  My<br/>
neighbor who plays on a 33.6 modem takes 4 minutes to zon on average.  Now<br/>
that&#39;s painful.<br/>

Why would the trip from Qeynos to Freeport take 45 minutes? With selo&#39;s you<br/>
can easily make it in 20.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I  think the melee/hybrid/caster thread needs to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be kaboinged.. now. And the bind thread should IMO<br/>
&gt;&gt; go the same way, but first I would like to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have an opinion on it, which you do - then it doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
&gt;&quot;kabonged&quot; after you get your opinion noted. Everyone should be free to<br/>
&gt;speak on the issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If there wasent a penalty like this the game would<br/>
&gt;&gt; turn into something very boring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And boy oh boy it&#39;s such exciting fun running back to<br/>
&gt;your corpse. Yay!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; With selo&#39;s we are pretty well off for travelling and<br/>
&gt;&gt; giving bards bind will seriusly overpower unless it was<br/>
&gt;&gt; made useless by giving it penalties.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Selo&#39;s gives us a good way of GETTING somewhere. It<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t even come close to comparing to gate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d be interested in seeing the results of a caster<br/>
&gt;and a bard racing from Freeport to Qeynos and back.<br/>
&gt;I can see it now. Caster pays 1pp for SOW and nearly<br/>
&gt;keeps up with bard. Bard arrives in Qeynos let&#39;s<br/>
&gt;be generous and say 10 minutes before wizard does.<br/>
&gt;Bard heads back and gleefully waves at wizard still<br/>
&gt;on his way to Qeynos. Wizard gets to Qeynos. Wizard<br/>
&gt;gates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>
&gt;while the bard is still running.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>
&gt;the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>
&gt;his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>
&gt;to Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport. Bard arrives in West<br/>
&gt;Commons on his way to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, Selo&#39;s makes up for all of that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
