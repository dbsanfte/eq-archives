<div id="ygrps-yiv-447398241">I have noticed that too.  Sometimes the code awards the loot randomly for<br/>
some reason, but the majority of the time it awards the kill to the person<br/>
who does the most damage overall.  I can personally verify this from my<br/>
time in the CB tower.  Besides, the funniest thing I saw was my lvl 20 wiz<br/>
friend back when he was level 14 or so blasting Crush with his spell for<br/>
8dmg and getting the kill and the loot.  Sometimes it is not perfect, but<br/>
it is still flawed IMHO.  There is no way that a caster that does 200 dmg<br/>
should get teh kill over a group of 6 melee people who do 150dmg each.<br/>
That is unfair if one group does 900dmg and one guy does 200 and he get&#39;s<br/>
the kill.<br/>
