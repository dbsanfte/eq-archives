<div id="ygrps-yiv-704463230">I have recently had all my worldly good stripped from me. Actually, they<br/>
were on my corpse, way up in Everfrost Peaks, but having died in Qeynos<br/>
Hills, I lost it.<br/>
Taking this as a sign from the Gods, I decided to practice Hand-to-Hand<br/>
attacking until I could generate more coin. Decided to truly live the life<br/>
of an ascetic, I choose to fast. I hoped that I could &quot;live on a song&quot; and<br/>
have Jaxon&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor restore any stamina a lost due to starvation.<br/>
This plan might have worked, but I zoned and the song ended and I forget to<br/>
re-sing it. I cast it as I passed out and watched my stamina and health<br/>
bars creep up and down near their midpoints. Eventually, I began to bleed<br/>
to death. I don&#39;t know why, I guess starvation will do that to you. The<br/>
Coup de Grace (sp?) was right before I died. I received a rather odd<br/>
message. I left it at home, but the gist was:<br/>
<br/>
Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>
Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>
you died<br/>
<br/>
Whoah! Who are these Pain and Suffering beasties? They apparently live in<br/>
the city of Qeynos, since that&#39;s where I was at the time.<br/>
I&#39;ve since decided that I should probably eat. As of this posting, Plastos<br/>
is camped out under the Dock of Qeynos, wishing he had more food and some<br/>
clothing. Tonight, the long climb back begins.<br/>
