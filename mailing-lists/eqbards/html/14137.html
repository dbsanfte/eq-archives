<b>Subject:</b> RE: Mask of Deception and ultravision <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-601409683">One thing I discovered the other day was that I cast the mask illusion and<br/>
got ultravision, but during the course of a fight I wove in psalm of warmth<br/>
and when the song ended, poof, there went my ultravision.  I just recast the<br/>
illusion and got the UV back.<br/>
<br/>
Its annoying but it seems to work still, oh but this is with the pre-patch<br/>
mask too so this test doesn&#39;t really validate your question...it just raises<br/>
a possible issue that I have experienced with respect to the affect.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of when I used to have a shiny brass shield back in the olden<br/>
days and whenever I entered and exited water I would have to unequip and<br/>
re-equip the shield to get the lightsource effect back.  That was a royal<br/>
pain the wazoo when I went to innothule for the first time!<br/>

&gt; Since DEs have innate ultravision, I was always under the <br/>
&gt; impression that<br/>
&gt; when you activated the DE illusion with the Mask of Deception <br/>
&gt; that you were<br/>
&gt; supposed to gain this ability.  As a wood elf, I have <br/>
&gt; infravision so can<br/>
&gt; normally see fine at night.  However, whenever I activate the <br/>
&gt; DE illusion,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m blind as a bat (i.e. I lose infravision and don&#39;t gain <br/>
&gt; ultravision).  I<br/>
&gt; have had shamans buff me with the Ultravision spell and I <br/>
&gt; have also had<br/>
&gt; magicians give me a Coldstone to equip so I know what Ultravision is<br/>
&gt; supposed to look like.  The difference at night when I have <br/>
&gt; either of these<br/>
&gt; two buffs versus the vision I have with the DE illusion is <br/>
&gt; literally the<br/>
&gt; difference between night and day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So is the Mask of Deception supposed to also give you <br/>
&gt; ultravision?  I have<br/>
&gt; talked with enchanters who regularly cast the DE illusion spell on<br/>
&gt; themselves so they can see at night.  Is it possible that <br/>
&gt; this component of<br/>
&gt; the Mask of Deception is broken?<br/>
