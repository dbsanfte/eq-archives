&gt; &gt;I was using the Discord song to just kite fire beetles for real nice xp<br/>
&gt; &gt;at lvl 3, is this considered an abuse? (I actualyl try to never take<br/>
&gt; &gt;advantage of games &quot;flaws&quot;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Congrats! I never managed to get the hang of kiting with CoD.  It is no more <br/>
&gt; abusive then any other form of kiting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, its not too hard, beetles dont run after you...  I could walk<br/>
backwards most of the time and just watch them keep flashing orange, it<br/>
took awhile, but with like 5 at a time it went pretty well...<br/>
<br/>
Then again, backing into a guard wasn&#39;t so sucessful :-)<br/>
