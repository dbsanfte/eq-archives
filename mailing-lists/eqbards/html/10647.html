<div id="ygrps-yiv-259837945"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; song: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge, Lev 43, this site says damage <br/>
&gt; is 311+(lev-43)*2 making MAX dame at Lev 50 only 325, and <br/>
&gt; does not say anything about mana; CH says it does 275 dam and <br/>
&gt; requires 800mana?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i got this song as soon as it was released, and used it once then realized<br/>
it also caused damage on myself if too close.  i did not start using it for<br/>
long after, but i now use it with caution and it absolutely does AE 325dmg<br/>
at level 50.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Instrument: Mistmore battle drums: this site says +20%; CH says +25%<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i heard it was 20% but have not done the testing that others on the list<br/>
have.  i believe the mm drum is 20% and selo&#39;s drum of march is 30% (i have<br/>
missed the last 3 nagafen raids all of which dropped a drum, grrrr).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Instrument: Lute of the gypsy princes: this site says no <br/>
&gt; effect; CH says +5%<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i gave mine to Cryssia a long time ago and never got another to test, but i<br/>
believe it has no effect.  and i STILL need to test Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed<br/>
Lute.  i think it may be 20% increase give or take, but i am very forgetful<br/>
and have yet to make sure.<br/>
