<b>Subject:</b> Is it safe to sing AE songs in dungeons now? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-509229589">With overcrowding a problem on almost every server, I&#39;m wondering if it is<br/>
now safe to add these songs back to our playlist.  Months ago when<br/>
overcrowding wasn&#39;t as big a problem, singing AE songs in a dungeon zone was<br/>
suicide because you were likely to start a massive train due to the z-axis<br/>
bug.  Nowadays, mobs in zones like LGuk are pulled usually within seconds<br/>
after they spawn.  <br/>
<br/>
Case in point.  Last Friday I was camping the assasin room in LGuk for over<br/>
four hours.  There was at least 70 people in the zone at all times.  We<br/>
often had 5-10 minutes of downtime in between fights because we couldn&#39;t<br/>
find anything to pull.  I strongly considered singing DDD (still need to max<br/>
my brass skill:-) but could not convince my group that it was safe to do so.<br/>
I even used the argument that in the rare event it did aggro a mob behind a<br/>
wall, since there were relatively few mobs on track we should be able to<br/>
avoid starting a train.  It might have even been useful in helping us pull.<br/>
That argument didn&#39;t work either and we ended up having a lot of downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions?<br/>
