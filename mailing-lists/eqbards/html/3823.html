<div id="ygrps-yiv-78801224">Hint.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s red.... don&#39;t attack it.  Try conning several of them.  If it&#39;s red<br/>
and killable, chances are good that a couple of them somewhere are going to<br/>
be yellow.  Otherwise, check it out the next time you level.  Or a couple<br/>
levels down the road... cuz if it&#39;s red to you then it isnt going to be<br/>
reasonably killable for at least 2 levels anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Alternately you could check out a site like EQlizer that gives the<br/>
approximate level spread of any given class of monsters without giving<br/>
serious spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Brad personally.  Exploration is good.  The rush of fear when I<br/>
see a new monster barrelling along the horizon in an outdoor zone, or<br/>
standing around the corner in an indoor one... that&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, dying sucks... did it twice in 15 minutes the other night in<br/>
Permafrost getting trained on... and almost did it a few more times than<br/>
that.... apologizing profusely all the while to those around me who I ended<br/>
up training onto because the mobs spawning up front were tougher than usual<br/>
for a couple hours there.  But even the IC cursing and fighting between the<br/>
PC&#39;s was fun.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess, what I am saying, here and in a couple other posts, is... This<br/>
game is as fun as you want it to be.  If you dont have fun unless you&#39;re<br/>
&quot;safe&quot;... well... I feel for you.  If you dont have fun with anything but<br/>
bashing NPC skulls well... I guess I feel for you too.  But you can find<br/>
your sort of fun in EQ, same as the rest of us.  I just wish you&#39;d quit<br/>
bitching about the rest of us getting to have OUR fun too.<br/>
<br/>
(generalized you there, please dont take it personally.)</div>
