<div id="ygrps-yiv-634409653">Uses for combat?  I don&#39;t think it will work.  It would be similar to going<br/>
invis while in the middle of combat, and that sure as heck don&#39;t work.  This<br/>
song has great longterm benefits in the fact that you&#39;ll get better prices<br/>
from NPC vendors when buying and selling.  It also allows you to start /<br/>
finish quests that would normally require a lot grunt work to get to the<br/>
appropriate faction.<br/>

Played with my new Level 11 spell today.  Its a nice faction modifier, have<br/>
seen mysefl go from inddiferent to amiable and from apprehensive to<br/>
indifferent.  Aside from using it to move past the occasional hostile mob, I<br/>
was wondering if it had any use in actul combat?  Thanks for any insight.</div>
