Subject: [eqbards] mana drains<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now that I think about it....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A level 57/58 wizard told me with all his items he has 3200 mana.  Let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; think about the level 49 song and fighting in lower guk.  Say you get 4<br/>
&gt; frogs and 2 of the 4 are casters. Your enchanter mezzes 3 of them and the<br/>
&gt; rest of the group attacks the melee class frog first.  If the fight lasts<br/>
30<br/>
&gt; seconds, that means 10 chances to drain say 200 mana.  So, you might get<br/>
&gt; 2/3rd&#39;s of the next target&#39;s mana - maybe only half since NPC&#39;s seem to<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; so damn much mana.  But after another 30 second fight - not only would you<br/>
&gt; continue to deplete the mana of the mezzed one but also the one being<br/>
&gt; killed.  So it&#39;s strength would be in multiple mob pulls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dunno - it&#39;s hard to imagine that it could be so strong as to make it a<br/>
&gt; really useful thing.  My gut feeling is that they don&#39;t really test it<br/>
&gt; hands-on.  Ie: do you think that Ester, GZ, and Absor go to Lguk on test,<br/>
&gt; shout for a group and try these things?  Or does GZ who knows the exact<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; pool of mobs, kinda make an educated guess and &quot;balance&quot; the song so that<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; theory &quot;on a good day&quot; - it might get like half the mana from a mob (that<br/>
&gt; normally dies before he can burn much mana anyhow - except GZ doesn&#39;t<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; know how fast mobs die.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be funny to depelete all the mobs mana and have your enchanter<br/>
yell<br/>
&gt; at you because he cant cast Theft of Thought on that mezzed Bok Shaman =)<br/>
&gt; &quot;Your target has no mana left to effect!&quot;<br/>
