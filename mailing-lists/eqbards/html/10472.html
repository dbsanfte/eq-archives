<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467494447">WooHoo!  I am definitely up for this!  Nothing could be funnier than 100<br/>
gnomes leaping to their deaths in hot boiling lava!  Maybe we could pile up<br/>
the corpses high enough to poke out of the lava even!<br/>

This idea was brought up on this mailing list quite some time ago, and never<br/>
<br/>
reached fruition. I therefore would like to entreat the EQ bardic community <br/>
to join ranks and set out to do something truly silly and pointless <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I am sure you are thinking, &quot;What can we do together, Aloro, <br/>
that would be silly and pointless and FUN?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You ARE thinking that, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
Good! So here is my proposal:<br/>
<br/>
What: Gnomestock &#39;99<br/>
When: Friday, November 26th, starting at noon PST (or another time if the <br/>
community prefers...)<br/>
Who: Anyone who plays a bard on EQ, or any of their friends, family, or <br/>
pets.<br/>
Where: E&#39;ci, starting in Ak&#39;Anon, we shall make a glorious lemming-like run <br/>
to Lavastorm, there to practice cliff-diving ito lava. We&#39;ll need to get <br/>
bound in Freeport so wave after wave of gnomes can hurl themselves into <br/>
fiery doom.<br/>
How: Create a first level gnome character. We should all have names that are<br/>
<br/>
somehow similar... one idea would be that all our names start with Gn, so <br/>
the puzzled PCs who watch wave after wave of gnomes run by will see the <br/>
connection. If we all have similar names it will make it easier to find each<br/>
<br/>
other too... it might be advisable to try to make a gnomish equivalent of <br/>
your bardic name (thus e.g. I could make a gnome named Gnaloro). I suppose <br/>
it might even be possible to form a guild for this event (Gnomestock would <br/>
be a good one... I don&#39;t really know how hard it is to start a new guild or <br/>
how long it takes, but it would be nice to have guildchat, and the guild <br/>
name would be priceless).<br/>
Why: Because we like you!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see something like this come together. let me know if it sounds <br/>
like a good idea and if you want to participate... if there&#39;s enough support<br/>
<br/>
this could be hilarious. We can make some marching<br/>
songs, and maybe sing cadences as we run...<br/>
