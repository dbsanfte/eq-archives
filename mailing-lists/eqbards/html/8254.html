&gt;The only reason I want rubicite is that I graduated from the University of<br/>
&gt;Alabama and the color of rubicite is our team color (crimson):-).  The<br/>
&gt;breastplate is the only piece I want.  Combined with steel for all the <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;pieces, I think that would look pretty cool.  Call me vain but with a CHR <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;115 it fits my character:-).  Based on the horror stories I&#39;ve read about<br/>
&gt;camping for rubicite, must admit I do not look forward to ever doing it.<br/>

want or need any more rubicite.  Currently have Rubi boots and that is all.  <br/>
Looks good with full visible steel except for gloves and helm.<br/>
