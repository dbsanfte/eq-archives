<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285074797">You CAN sing more than one song at a time...it&#39;s called Twisting. When u<br/>
stop a song, there is a lingering affect for abour 5 seconds, time enough to<br/>
start another song and return to the origional, if u aren&#39;t bashed or<br/>
slammed in combat. The best combo is to play your lyre and &quot;twist&quot; Heal and<br/>
Anthem of arms...u know it is working if both icons are up at the same time.<br/>
Just rotate quickly between the 2 songs. Work on different twising combos as<br/>
u get new songs. For example, notice how when u stop accelerondo u keep<br/>
moving fast for a few more seconds...it works and is an established Bardic<br/>
tactic....There are limits however, it is difficult to twist in battle if u<br/>
are engaged with a weapon, so the tactics is best used with your instrument.<br/>
3 songs at once is Impossible, and when u get Bellow u can only work in one<br/>
Bellow before having to switch back to the other song.    Work on it to get<br/>
the cadence and u will do fine with this tactic. Garet Wynn(18th circle<br/>

&gt;&gt;Simple answer . . . you can&#39;t sing more than one at a &gt;time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;To figure out why, trying singing Happy Birthday and &gt;Three Blind<br/>
&gt;Miceat<br/>
&gt;&gt;the same time to your friends and family. If you &gt;succeed, call<br/>
&gt;Verantand<br/>
&gt;&gt;tell them EQ is unrealistic . . .<br/>

&gt;I must say I agree with this. Though I am as yet young and unskilled in<br/>
&gt;the arts of the bard, I find it difficult to sing two songs at the same<br/>
&gt;time. I tried singing two songs the other day, and people threw<br/>
&gt;vegetables at me! Mind you, I was actually grateful, as I was very<br/>
&gt;hungry, but I don&#39;t think this is the reaction I would desire on a<br/>
&gt;regular basis.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m wondering if anyone understands quite what I am saying.<br/>
