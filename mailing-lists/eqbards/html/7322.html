<b>Subject:</b> RE: Group damage - was Revised? Patch Update today <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390457044"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Did they revise the patch message?  It now says the group <br/>
&gt; damage getting the exp only has been applied to the Fennin<br/>
&gt; Ro server.  Those bums!  How long have we all been waiting<br/>
&gt; for this change?  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If more people played on the actual Test server, things like<br/>
this wouldn&#39;t need to be done. However their only option <br/>
was to test it out on a live server. Instead of putting in<br/>
this change (that might be bugged all to heck) on EVERY<br/>
server and upsetting *tens of thousands* of players if it<br/>
didn&#39;t work, they&#39;re doing the very intelligent thing and<br/>
keeping the test limited.<br/>
<br/>
People would complain if they put it everywhere and it didn&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
People are complaining because they didn&#39;t put it everywhere<br/>
to test it to make sure it works.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true - you can&#39;t make all the people happy all the time.</div>
