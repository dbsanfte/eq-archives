&gt;1) Not all randoms were created equal. What I mean is that I&#39;m sure that<br/>
&gt;some spawns are pure random between several items on an encounter table.<br/>
&gt;(eg. newbie areas, a spawn has an equal shot of getting a bug, a bat, a<br/>
&gt;snake, etc.) However, for the named spawns, I&#39;m equally sure that the named<br/>
&gt;has a lower chance of spawning than the place holder. They have to do it<br/>
&gt;that way to limit the entry of items into the game. The way the game<br/>
&gt;probably works is that it grabs a random number from the generator and then<br/>
&gt;performs additional calculations before arriving at the final number which<br/>
&gt;it uses to check to see what is spawned. This makes it much harder to<br/>
&gt;determine the true randomness of the generator. The only instance I can find<br/>
&gt;where there would be no additional processing would be with the /random<br/>
&gt;command. And my experience has shown it to be fairly random. If you were<br/>
&gt;truly curious, I would advise that you take a large sample set of data with<br/>
&gt;the /random command and analyze that data. But trying to extrapolate<br/>
&gt;randomness from spawn tables and loot drops is somewhat pointless. There are<br/>
&gt;other steps we are unaware of that will not be taken into account.<br/>

but you don&#39;t have to massage the rng for that to happen.  one easy way would be<br/>
to do generate a floating point number between 0 and 1.  multiply that by 10000.  now<br/>
you set up a case statement for the spawn table and you have a 0.01% granularity on<br/>
how rare the spawn is.  if you didn&#39;t want that much control, you could just generate<br/>
a random number between 1 and 100 and do the same thing.  pure random doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily have to mean 50/50.</div>
