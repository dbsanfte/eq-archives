<div id="ygrps-yiv-831717572">Note: For the longest time, Harmony did absolutely nothing and was<br/>
worthless at a spell. I bought it because I am a completist and I<br/>
wanted everything. At some time, they did a &quot;silent de-nerf&quot; and<br/>
made Harmony more than do something -- but actually be WORTH<br/>
using. It is possible, if he doesn&#39;t read the net, this druid<br/>
tried Harmony/heard from like levels that it was worthless and<br/>
thus never actually bought it... and has not been doing outside<br/>
stuff with groups since that someone mentioned &quot;Hey, Harmony<br/>
-works- now&quot;<br/>

&gt;hehehe ok i like this topic... here is one for you all.  in butcherblock<br/>
&gt;killing dwarven citizens (it&#39;s cheesy but easy, hey that rhymes) i met a<br/>
&gt;level 40 druid.  he asked me to help him split up 2 dwarves who were<br/>
&gt;together.  it seemed strange being a druid and all, so i just said use<br/>
&gt;harmony.  he said: &quot;i&#39;m gonna go buy it.&quot;<br/>
