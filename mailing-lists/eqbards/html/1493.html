<b>Subject:</b> Level 8 song in Kelethin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737440473">Hail friends,<br/>
<br/>
My inquiry today has three parts:<br/>
<br/>
1) I am a lvl 8 bard from Freeport.  What are the general directions to get to Kelethin?  I know the boat to Butcherblock part but from there on I am lost.<br/>
<br/>
2) Also as a lvl 8 bard, what should I hunt to get the most loot?  I have been grouping in E. Commons but it is getting rather crowded and there are very few &quot;good loot&quot; monsters besides Darkweeds and Centurions, neither of which I like to take alone.  You see, I spent the vast majority of my cash on leather armor (cap, tunic, leggings, shoulderpads, and neck armor).  I know it will cost me to get the lvl 8 song and I&#39;d like to get the lvl 9 song while I&#39;m there.  How much cash should I take?<br/>
<br/>
3) How dangerous is the passage to Kelethin?  I&#39;d like to not die on another continent if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
And now for my gripe of the day:<br/>
<br/>
How much trouble does everyone else have with lvl 3-8 parties attempting to take things like orc camps?  My party today (me, 2 dwarf clerics, 1 monk, and 2 paladins all lvls 7-10) spent about 3 hours camping one of the orc camps near the Hidden Inn in E. Commons.  After the first hard battle, we took them one or two at a time.  It worked out quite well and nearly got me to lvl 9.  When we disbanded, I moved along to the Hidden Inn to pick up another party.  Within 15 minutes, I had died 3 times from people training Centurions and Legionnaires to the inn from the other orc camp.  For some reason, I feel obligated to help these morons out every time and it tends to cost me quite a bit of my xp.  Needless to say I am 1 1/2 bubble away from 9 now.  Does anyone have any thoughts on how I should handle these types of situations?  From what I understand from this list, the lvl 8 song would be a great help.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for wading through my novella here,<br/>

P.S.  Maybe a rumor, but does killing Bixies really cause Griffins to spawn.  There were three in E. Commons today.</div>
