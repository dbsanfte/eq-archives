<div id="ygrps-yiv-55415518"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The Tier&#39;dal Seargents were blue to me at level 40.  The<br/>
&gt; Tier&#39;dal Lieutenants were red to me, yellow to a L45 friend.  <br/>
&gt; The named NPCs were red to the L45 friend.  If the high level<br/>
&gt; people hadn&#39;t killed all the &quot;good&quot; NPCs (I assume you mean<br/>
&gt; good-potential-loot NPCs), the low level people probably<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve died a lot more.  Of course my server (Karana)<br/>
&gt; crashed before the culmination of the event (210 people in<br/>
&gt; Kithicor will do that).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What *was* amusing was a lot of the high level folks had the<br/>
&gt; &quot;it&#39;s blue, kill it&quot; attitude so ingrained that they ended up<br/>
&gt; killing NPCs that were on our side.  Hope they enjoy the<br/>
&gt; faction loss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These were the good NPC&#39;s I meant...at level 24, I had no hope of<br/>
actually killing them myself, I know they were high level.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
really ranting about not getting anything, I didn&#39;t really expect to,<br/>
I was ranting about the high levels finally getting organized, but<br/>
killing the pivotal NPCs.  After the whole Innoruk and the opening of<br/>
the plane, it seemed like the NPCs were all put on autopilot so...I<br/>
guess I don&#39;t *really* understand what was going on, but it seemed<br/>
really disorganized and as if someone had killed an NPC they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have and ruined what the GM&#39;s were trying to do.  I guess if they<br/>
really don&#39;t want someone killed they make them invincible, but<br/>
whatever.  I thought it was cool to be there for the plane opening.<br/>
