<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-438389480">Last night, I brushed the dust off our plainchant trilogy, and wow.<br/>
<br/>
Testing on myself with no instrument, I was shown the same results as<br/>
prior: 10 dmg/tick for 3 ticks (11 factoring in the 1 hp/tick regen).<br/>
Breaking out the drum (Selo&#39;s), I managed to do a good 81 points of damage<br/>
to myself over three ticks, and reduce resistance by a bit over 30.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get a chance to test it very well (being in Fear at the time),<br/>
but I am very much looking forward to ditching weapons for a while<br/>
(especially in light of John&#39;s recent atk speed analysis).<br/>
