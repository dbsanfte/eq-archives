<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249458831">You can solo as a bard fairly effective till about 21st or 22nd level.<br/>
<br/>
98% of the experience I&#39;ve made from 22nd to 30th has been in groups.  And<br/>
90% of that has been in a dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Soloing is fine, but to a degree it&#39;s actually counter productive.  The<br/>
skills you learn soloing generally aren&#39;t the same types of skills you need<br/>
to be working effectively in a group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it&#39;s *SO* much more fun in a full group, with everyone knowing<br/>
their role.  Once you&#39;ve tasted it, you&#39;ll find it terrible to be w/o a<br/>
group.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well met everyone,<br/>

&gt;&gt; This is not a complaint mind you. Soloing has made me into a hardy<br/>

&gt;Well, I&#39;ve been soloing almost non-stop, all the way up to level 11 now.<br/>
&gt;Due to my random hours and such, even those I used to journey with for a<br/>
&gt;day or two are now too far ahead of me for me to group with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I personally don&#39;t mind soloing, again because of my random hours, since<br/>
&gt;it allows me to go where I want, when I want (well, within reason--Bards<br/>
&gt;still need to have the ability to bind themselves in my mind.  Ain&#39;t no<br/>
&gt;way I&#39;m gonna pay greedy spellcasters for that, especially now that some<br/>
&gt;of them have started charging platinum.)<br/>
