<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002467401">Okee - so EQ caters to men by selling them the idea that playing EQ makes them more attractive to women & makes them more masculine. Therefore, enhancing their social & sexual prowess.<br/>
<br/>
Great! I am a 44 year old mother of 2 teenagers - single - well-rounded (figure wise) - semi-computer literate.<br/>
<br/>
Why was I drawn to EQ? Let&#39;s see the unconscious desire to be Firiona Vie? To seduce young male wood elves & enslave them as my personal sex slaves?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, right. Obviously it is the author of this article that has some suppressed sexual/masculine issues that need to be addressed.<br/>
