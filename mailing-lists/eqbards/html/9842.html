<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637270173">Hmmm, Mistmoore pathing...now there&#39;s an interesting subject.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I can give on this from my limited experience in MM is that<br/>
you really need to know the zone very well and know what spawns where and be<br/>
very very careful if you choose to attack a wandering mob that does not<br/>
normally spawn in the area you see it in and was not pulled there by a<br/>
train.  The pathing is SCREWY here.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
I have been camping the Courtyard extensively as of late and the spot along<br/>
the wall in the lower part of the courtyard as you are approaching the area<br/>
beneath the bridge.  When a train pours out of the castle, as the mobs are<br/>
returning they path so weirdly that they look like they are walking right<br/>
towards you and then through you and through the wall behind you.  I have<br/>
seen mob after mob, gargs, gypsies, vamps, all kinds of stuff walk right<br/>
into me and disappear.  They do not see you and do not attack...their normal<br/>
pathing is screwed and it is a quirk that you can see them at all, if you<br/>
were to attack them while they were on this path their aggro radius has the<br/>
potential of pulling the train back out of the castle on top of you but if<br/>
you leave them alone you are fine.  Weird and very scary at 2am in the<br/>
morning when your group of 6 comprises 60% of the people in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
In the tunnel right as  you enter MM you sometimes see a skeletal pet in the<br/>
corner in front of you just standing around...it will leave you alone but if<br/>
you attack it, its master on the other side of that wall which is deep<br/>
within the castle, will kill you in a jiffy.  Pick your fights wisely and DO<br/>
NOT, I repeat DO NOT use AE songs in this zone unless you are very certain<br/>
of where you are what you might affect that is on the other side of a<br/>
wall...it is utterly deadly.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps Galt, sorry to hear about your misfortune.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, I was grouped with a necromancer in MM.  There were only a<br/>
&gt; handful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs <br/>
&gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; zone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two <br/>
&gt; familiars that we were<br/>
&gt; handling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle <br/>
&gt; appeared.  None of<br/>
&gt; the other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact <br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; lead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the <br/>
&gt; necro was over<br/>
&gt; 75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and <br/>
&gt; was killed.  He<br/>
&gt; checked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>
&gt; explanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>
&gt; familiars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to <br/>
&gt; sing Lullaby and<br/>
&gt; put them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three <br/>
&gt; flouting gargoyles<br/>
&gt; appeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the <br/>
&gt; time.  Before I<br/>
&gt; had a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped <br/>
&gt; and was knocked<br/>
&gt; from 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there <br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t any<br/>
&gt; text messages to indicate I should have taken that much <br/>
&gt; damage in one shot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a <br/>
&gt; bug, which I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; told sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned <br/>
&gt; right next to the<br/>
&gt; zone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  <br/>
&gt; Everyone in the<br/>
&gt; zone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know where<br/>
&gt; flouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere <br/>
&gt; near where<br/>
&gt; everyone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the <br/>
&gt; graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone <br/>
&gt; except due to a<br/>
&gt; bug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by <br/>
&gt; a spell, which<br/>
&gt; could have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot. <br/>
&gt;  Even if I did<br/>
&gt; get hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one <br/>
&gt; shot (usually<br/>
&gt; with Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did <br/>
&gt; get hit for<br/>
&gt; physical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit <br/>
&gt; points of health,<br/>
&gt; which was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>
