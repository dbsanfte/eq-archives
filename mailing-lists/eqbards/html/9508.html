<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958209067">Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>
events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>
Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>
live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has 1.5<br/>
million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the retail release<br/>
of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be very aggressive in<br/>
retaining and growing their current player base.  I don&#39;t envy them having<br/>
to compete against Microsoft.<br/>

&gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
&gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
