  Everyone here is thinking about what&#39;s the norm in the current<br/>
  game.  Max hit on non-plane Norrath is like 400 dmg per strike,<br/>
  and that&#39;s rare.  Max hit on planar realms is in the thousands.<br/>
  Kunark gonna be a bunch of L40 mobs?  Hell no.  Everything is <br/>
  gonna have DT, and melee in the 500-1000s... I have no doubt about<br/>
  it.  I was right about the L60, and about the spells per level,<br/>
  so my track record here is pretty good =)<br/>

When Gordon says that some of the new mobs will make Vox/Nag look like lawn<br/>
trash you bet we need better songs.   When many of the other classes are<br/>
getting group buffing spells our songs need to keep pace with this power up.<br/>
Many of the classes are getting insta-kill spells at 60th (Wizards:<br/>
Distentagrate.  Necros/Clerics: Banish Undead, Magicians: Banish Summoned)<br/>
This is the level of power 60th lvl groups will have.  Makes me think I<br/>
undershoot on my song ideas.<br/>
