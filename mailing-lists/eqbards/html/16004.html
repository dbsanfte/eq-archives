<div id="ygrps-yiv-320210054">Same with Sol Ro.  Now I don&#39;t know how Hate is on everybody else&#39;s server<br/>
but on ours, we prefer to do Hate with 10-16 people.  24 is the upper limit<br/>
of bearable, but needed for teh Maestro, 30 is considered &quot;annoyingly<br/>
crowded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning I logged into Hate and FIFTY FOUR people  The lag was so<br/>
bad you couldn&#39;t move, the SS was so crowded my barb butt couldn&#39;t even sit<br/>
on the floor!<br/>
<br/>
And this is AFTER the split...............<br/>

Yeah, on Fennin Ro we had some of these back when there were 2,800 people on<br/>
the server.  When there&#39;s that many folks on the game is litterally just<br/>
barely playable.  You are routinely dropped when zoning (sometimes 70% of<br/>
the time).<br/>

Ovurcrowding has deafeated Bandwidth in a duel to the death!<br/>

etc. etc.<br/>
