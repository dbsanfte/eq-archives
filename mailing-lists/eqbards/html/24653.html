<div id="ygrps-yiv-140422232">Honestly for me its because since the release of Kunark and Velious, I&#39;ve<br/>
seen our warriors and rogues outfitted in a dozen or more different weapons<br/>
each, approximately 3 sets of new armor and a dozen &quot;uber&quot; items while the<br/>
casters (especially int casters) sit around in jumpy and mana robes (which<br/>
in case you dont know really aren&#39;t goo).  In our guild, Bards fall along<br/>
the same lines, they aren&#39;t considered &quot;important&quot; enough to go in on the<br/>
tank items so end up getting pretty much squat for their time and effort.<br/>
After a few months, its gets frustrating.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I said in my example that when the warrior got the crscent <br/>
&gt; blade, I was<br/>
&gt; given his lammy,  Of course we discovered I can&#39;t wield it, <br/>
&gt; so it went on to<br/>
&gt; another member.  To be honest I don&#39;t think I should have <br/>
&gt; been given the<br/>
&gt; lammy in any case.  I currently wield Sinoche&#39;s Partisan and <br/>
&gt; Trolloch&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Skien (10/25 5pois, procs a poison based whirl type stun, off <br/>
&gt; hand only).<br/>
&gt; The Lamentation is equal to the Partisan, and worth 2-3x as much.  And<br/>
&gt; certainly worth more than an off hand weapon for a class that <br/>
&gt; doesnt melee<br/>
&gt; all the time and doesn&#39;t get double attack.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Getting warriors weapons should be a top priority of a guild. <br/>
&gt;  Warriors are<br/>
&gt; critical for many raids, they tend to live the longest and <br/>
&gt; need to have<br/>
&gt; every oppurtunity to keep the mob taunted on them.  Behind <br/>
&gt; them fall in all<br/>
&gt; the other melees, then behind that gaggle bards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand<br/>
&gt; why bards get upset when weapons are awarded to other classes first...<br/>
