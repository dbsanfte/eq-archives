At L18, twisting guardian and elemental rhythms with a drum<br/>
gives a whopping +50% to magic resist.  That can really take<br/>
the edge off spellcasting or charming mobs.<br/>

Saving the party from an ubermob.  If a sand giant starts to<br/>
attack your L10 party, equip your drum, fire up Accelerando,<br/>
punch the SG, and take off away from your party.  It&#39;s risky,<br/>
but I&#39;ve found that to be a better way to save everyone than<br/>
try to make sure they&#39;re all under the effect of Accelerando<br/>
as they try to run away.  Usually everyone ends up running in<br/>
different directions.<br/>

Also, when doing the Lament trick, make sure you party is a<br/>
ways off before you try it.  If you fail, the mobs should all<br/>
charge you.  You should be able to get away with Accelerando,<br/>
or at least buy enough time before you die for your party to<br/>
get away.<br/>
