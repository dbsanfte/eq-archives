turns it down for my eyes sake<br/>

<br/>
How many songs can you twist? 3 without problems<br/>
Do you slow down when it rains? nope<br/>
How about in Unrest or Kunark? 3<br/>
<br/>
Note: Problems with athlons and Geforce&#39;s are mostly connected to the fact that<br/>
the atlon and Geforce needs LOTS of power, and just because a PS is labeled 300W<br/>
does not mean that its better than another brand labeled  200W, you have to be<br/>
carefull and select one that truely delivers the power it promises.<br/>
