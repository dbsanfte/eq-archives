Subject: RE: [eqbards] Oven located...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went to the Temple of Droga and the Mines of Nurga alone last night<br/>
specifically looking for ovens.  There are NO ovens or other appliances that<br/>
I could find in the Mines of Nurga.  There IS an oven in the Temple of Droga<br/>
in a goblin building waaay in the back in a section of the dungeon that is<br/>
hidden behind a secret wall.  I opened it and it is a standard six-slot<br/>
oven.  In addition to the oven, when I was there one of the guards standing<br/>
directly to the right of the door leading into the space where the oven is<br/>
had a BOOK.  He was the &quot;goblin fanatic&quot;.  The mobs in that space are all<br/>
level 33-38 or so and fairly densely packed, so although I could have taken<br/>
the Fanatic down solo several of his buddies would definitely jump to his<br/>
aid and killed me (many are casters as well).  It would have been similar to<br/>
fighting three or four Greater Kobolds in Sol B simultaneously - I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have won and the corpse retrieval would have been very difficult and time<br/>
consuming.  So I briefly tried to get some guildmates interested, but going<br/>
way to the back of a mid-level dungeon located in the center of a zone that<br/>
no one was near so that I might be able to bake a cake really didn&#39;t<br/>
interest them...  ;-/<br/>
<br/>
One interesting sidebar is that the Jail has a Pottery Wheel in a jail cell<br/>
behind a locked door.  Now this is probably for another quest or something,<br/>
but it raises the remote possibility in my mind that we might have to make a<br/>
Bundt Cake Pan.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-Spoiler:<br/>
When I was there (alone and invis) nothing attacked me and I had free run of<br/>
the place.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any mobs other than goblins except for a<br/>
couple of Iksar prisoners in a jail (i.e. no lone Burynai Prisoner or<br/>
something that might drop some Burynai Meat).  Word of advice: I fell into<br/>
the pit trap located on the map pointed to in this thread.  You fall into a<br/>
jail cell and into a locked room.  Presumably if you kill the three goblins<br/>
in this room one or more will drop a key for you.  I didn&#39;t find out because<br/>
after I memmed some songs and was working up the courage to Lament the first<br/>
couple the wandering goblin was kind enough to open the locked doors for me,<br/>
so I scooted out invis and didn&#39;t have to fight.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no garauntee that the book has anything to do with the quest.  In<br/>
fact, I would think that a recipe would drop as a scroll and not a book, and<br/>
not off of a &quot;Goblin Fanatic&quot; but a &quot;Goblin Pastry Chef&quot; hehe... but who<br/>
knows.  Verant has surprised me before.  A lot.<br/>
<br/>
The pieces are starting to come together on this quest.  Let&#39;s keep pushing<br/>
on it.<br/>
