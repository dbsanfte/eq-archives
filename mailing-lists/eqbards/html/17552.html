Discord, but switching instruments in a dungeon setting mid combat just<br/>
gives me the creeps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	You&#39;re right, screech would&#39;ve given me the option to fear/chain<br/>
and on hindsight that would&#39;ve been a better song choice.  At the time I<br/>
was worried about Shaman and their healing capabilities, so I had Pixie<br/>
Strike.  That really wasn&#39;t necessary though.  Also, Tagar&#39;s and other<br/>
slowdown spells have no affect on you when you go all instruments, which<br/>
is a huge plus :).<br/>
	BTW, your original numbers on damage/second aren&#39;t totally<br/>
accurate, because you didn&#39;t figure in hand to hand damage.  My hand to<br/>
hand skill went up at least 10 points last night.<br/>
