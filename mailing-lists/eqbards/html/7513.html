<div id="ygrps-yiv-628668656">Ok I rarely post here, but when I got something good, I gots to let people know about it.  I have seen the posts about how well everyone has used lullaby and how it kicks ass so much.  Well I had never had a true need to use it until tonite.  My group, 2 druids, 1 ranger, 1 wizard, 1 cleric, 1 bard - me, were in Solusek&#39;s Eye.  The ranger was pulling for us and he had a bad pull.  So I told everyone to assist him while I did nothing but play my lullaby with my mandolin.  Worked freaking awesome.  We had about 2 cinder goblins, 2 young goblins,  and maybe 2 or 3 inferno goblins.  They did the usual resist and whack me pretty good but the cleric helped on that.  Then when they turned on him the ranger taunted them off.  So after about  5 to 10 minutes of killing thes guys we med up.  Then we hear the infamous &quot;Train to zone!&quot;.  Here we go to the good part.  About 9 goblins came running down and I fired up lullaby.  They all stopped and nodded.  The people they were chasing stopped and were like WTF?!?  I kept playing while my group took them all down 1 by 1.  After it was over the bystanders had one word to say, &quot;You guys rock.&quot;  Why yes we did.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Then later that night the ranger went a little too deep and got killed by a rather large train.  There was a goblin shaman that could see invisible so we couldn&#39;t just sneak past to get his body.  So I said let me train them to the zone and then you go /corpse your body out of there.  I issued the normal warnings to the zone, checked to make sure I would not drop any on anyone, and then pulled them to the zone.  I stopped there and lullabyed them while the ranger drug his body to a safe spot to loot.  Then when they got me low and he was safe, I zoned and healed up.  Ahh I just Iove being a bard.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Right before I was planning on logging, I did get killed.  Stupid me was bound in Rivervale.  Oh well not too far to run for a bard.  ;)<br/>
