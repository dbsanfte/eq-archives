<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-762306907"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	Bards, well, we invited Tokisada to most of our raids, and<br/>
&gt; Weadaneye to almost all of them.  We had room for bards, and we happy<br/>
&gt; invited bards from other guilds to come and help.  Weadaneye has Evensong<br/>
&gt; and a Six Note Blade now, and both have Selo&#39;s Drum/Orbs, so it&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; secret we appreciate their time and effort.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I am one of the biggest fans of your guild.  I respect you all<br/>
  as players a lot.  The time and effort you spending into the<br/>
  mechanics of the game intrigues me.  I am a quantitative person, <br/>
  and I like to figure out how things work.  I&#39;ve asked to come<br/>
  on raids before, never even got a response from your GM.  I would<br/>
  love to help you all out by learning some things, but there&#39;s no<br/>
  way for me to get Selo&#39;s Drum or McVax&#39;s Horn if I don&#39;t first<br/>
  go to a dragon raid.  Conversely, not responding to me, and ignoring<br/>
  me also leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m just a bard looking for a piece of the action.<br/>
