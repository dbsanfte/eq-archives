<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208017541"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts about keeping all your skills maxed so you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;pay for it later on and this seems like sound advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  I did nothing with blunt or <br/>
piercing until level 35, at which point I switched to a Staff of Writhing <br/>
and a Sacrificial Dagger.  I&#39;m level 37 now and I have both those skills up <br/>
to the 150 range.  They go up pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
(Last night I accidentally left the staff in the bank so I was fighting <br/>
dual daggers, sacrificial in right hand and dragoon dirk in left.  Gained <br/>
about 30 points in piercing in 4 hours.)<br/>
