<div id="ygrps-yiv-936709921">I think the infinite sphere concept is more likely what is happening.  I was<br/>
hanging out at the Aviak Village a couple weeks ago.  I saw a Harrier<br/>
perched up on top of one of the ledges.  Usually I bellow them off, but this<br/>
time I didn&#39;t have Bellow memmed.  Anyway, I went and stood underneath the<br/>
ledge and fired up CoD - sure enough, the Harrier got popped and jumped down<br/>
to have a discussion with me.  I am pretty sure that his altitude relative<br/>
to me was greater than the &quot;normal&quot; horizontal radius of CoD<br/>

I wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a infinite<br/>
cylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For example, the<br/>
infinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>
cylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter how high), and<br/>
below you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would be an equal<br/>
radius from you in all directions.  I have always been under the impression<br/>
that the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also always been<br/>
under the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>
separated from you by the ground/wall but still within the radius of the<br/>
sphere were still affected.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this?  <br/>

&gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting actively pulled -<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; no problems.  If not, you get attacked by invisible birds (cuz they stand<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>
&gt; SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended along the z-axis.<br/>
