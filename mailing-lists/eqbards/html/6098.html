<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992270895">I recently sent Geoffrey Zatkin an email with a couple questions and gripes<br/>
about our class.  Nothing too major, just looking for some info.  To my<br/>
surprise, he sent me back a fairly prompt response.  I&#39;ve included my<br/>
original message, along with his comments below.  Not a whole lot of info,<br/>
but its something.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; First off, let me say that I&#39;m sorry to be sending you this in an email.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure you get hundreds of messages a day from people complaining about<br/>
&gt; various issues, and I would quite understand if you don&#39;t have the time to<br/>
&gt; answer or even read this message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am currently playing a level 37 Bard on the Erollisi Marr server, and I<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; very happy with my class, and the game in general.  I think you guys have<br/>
&gt; done a wonderful job and I&#39;ve never complained about any changes that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you&#39;ve<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; made to my class, or others.  I understand that changes you do make are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thought out and implemented in the name of game balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, here is my issue.  There was recently a change made to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; level 23 bard song - Selo&#39;s Consanent Chain.  This song now will not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>effect<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; MOBs that are SoW&#39;d.  While I feel that this is a downgrade to the song, I<br/>
&gt; really have no complaint with it, and am willing to take it in stride.  My<br/>
&gt; problem is this; why was this change not announced in the patch message?<br/>
&gt; When a song that I have counted on for 14 levels suddenly doesn&#39;t work as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; always has it is very distressing, especially when used in a critical<br/>
&gt; situation.  (Namely, trying to chain a running frog shamen in Lguk before<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trains back half the dungeon).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want to change the way a song works, that is certainly your<br/>
&gt; perogative, its your game after all.  It would be nice however if this<br/>
&gt; change was aknowleged so that I don&#39;t have to get myself killed when I<br/>
&gt; expect it to work as it always has.  I have also seen no messages after<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fact stating whether this is a bug or a planned fix.  I don&#39;t know whether<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; should be expecting this to be fixed, or if this is the way its always<br/>
 </span></blockquote>going<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to be.  Why is there not some medium of comunication for Verant employees<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; discuss matters like these?  I frequently read message boards and various<br/>
&gt; web sites, so I know I haven&#39;t just missed it.  Maybe a list of current<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bugs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or features so that people could as least know that you are aware that a<br/>
&gt; problem exists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess that&#39;s really my only major issue, I&#39;d just like to know what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; going on instead of being surprised all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    That was an unintentional bug from fixing something else - it has<br/>
hopefully been fixed with this patch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Minor issues that I may as well mention while I&#39;m here:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why when I&#39;m playing my drum does it look like I&#39;m strumming a stick?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    We lost an animation somewhere - hopefully it will be fixed when we do<br/>
our art patch (we don&#39;t do many art patches - too many megs)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why can MOBs SoW themselves indoors, yet players cannot cast SoW or use<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s.  Is this a bug or is it supposed to be this way?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    It is on our list of things to fix - i don&#39;t like it either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bard skills that are capped at 40 (forage, sneak, hide).  This limit is so<br/>
&gt; low that the skill is useless.  I&#39;ve removed these from my hotkey bank<br/>
&gt; becuase they&#39;re impossible to use.  I&#39;m not saying the cap should removed,<br/>
&gt; bards are after all supposed to be jack of all trades, master of none, but<br/>
&gt; how about raising this a bit so that they might be at least worth using.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not, they may as well be removed completely as far as I&#39;m concerned<br/>
 </span></blockquote>becuase<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they fail too much to be worth using.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;ll check on that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How about letting us know when our missing songs will be implemented?  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not saying you have to tell me what they are, or what they do, it would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be nice at least know when they might be available.  I&#39;m approaching level<br/>
&gt; 39, and am wondering if this song will exist when I get there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    There are very few that are not in - and they are waiting for<br/>
something...  :)<br/>
