<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why did you start a Bard (long winded look at the good old da ys) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007974841">First off: Slyde and others on Xegony: I haven&#39;t played much in the last<br/>
couple months, bought a house so massive moving, unpacking, reconnecting,<br/>
painting, wallpapering, etc ensued. Then the Holidays set in. So now things<br/>
are coming slowly under control, we are taking a bit more time to play, that<br/>
and we&#39;re too broke to do much else LOL! We&#39;ve also got 2 crops of twinks<br/>
coming along and I&#39;m about to roll up a cleric (HE or Dwarf?) I&#39;ve never<br/>
spent a whole lot of time in Karnors, but Sebilis is fun. Always good to<br/>
kill froggies! We are hanging out with and making new friends in Venator<br/>
Sapentia since our guild is farily small these days, so they invite us out<br/>
to do new places. Plus some of the VS are Excals that left for a larger<br/>
guild that could &#39;do the big things&#39;. They do this without any squabbling<br/>
over loot and usually with very good organization.<br/>
<br/>
Now why am I a bard. I wasn&#39;t a bard before, UO didn&#39;t have them per se, nor<br/>
did Realm. I typically tend towards a versatile class in most games. I<br/>
started EQ in Beta 3.  I made many many characters, sometimes just to get a<br/>
look at a new town. Some leveled to 5 or 10, sometimes I changed the stats<br/>
and restarted just to see what would happen. I remember a human druid<br/>
starting in Surefall: got stuck in the tunnel out she was so blind. Maybe<br/>
that&#39;s why humans get candles at starting today, hehe. My very first<br/>
character was a WE druid but GFay kept crashing. So I rolled up a dark elf<br/>
shadow knight. She got as high as L10 before Beta 4 and the wipe. Somewhere<br/>
in all these characters, I started a WE bard. Brilinnia was a name courtesy<br/>
of the random generator. Leveled a few levels and explored a bit, as in<br/>
Faydark to Qeynos at L6 (&quot;What race are you??&quot;). I rerolled her more than<br/>
once to see what effect the starting stats would have, played other races<br/>
and classes but always came back to the bard. I think that was the main<br/>
hook, traveling, but it just seemed to be the class that fit and was the<br/>
most fun, even now. I could go places nearly fearlessly because of Selos. I<br/>
ran into another bard in Qeynos, of the unimaginable high level of 30<br/>
something and he took me out to South Karanas after showing me how he kited<br/>
griffawns and borer beetles and explain some of the things he&#39;d learned<br/>
about barding. We went to SK to check on the Liseria lute quest and bug or<br/>
feedback it since it was still broken. Beta was a great adventure as we<br/>
hardly knew what zone connected to which and how to get there. Bards could<br/>
travel better than anyone to explore territory and there were almost no<br/>
tp&#39;ers, the few with that kind of level were deep underground and rarely if<br/>
ever seen. It was freedom and appealed to the type of bard I enjoyed: the<br/>
traveled scholar. Corpse locate was also hugely important in those days. I<br/>
remember helping a 30 something warrior the day they put the muddites in<br/>
Beholder&#39;s Gorge. He got blinded and ganged by them and had no idea where<br/>
his corpse was besides in the Gorge somewhere. He was bound in Freeport.<br/>
I&#39;ve always carried a lightstone since those days, to aid those not blessed<br/>
with good sight. I never got higher than L14 and that came on the last day<br/>
of beta, but I knew my main would always be a bard. After gold, I became a<br/>
specialist in recovering drowned corpses. It&#39;s a funny but good feeling to<br/>
zone into Cazi and have your name shouted across the zone and find out this<br/>
was someone who&#39;s body you pulled out of a river once when they had given it<br/>
up for lost. Or go to OOT and recover one your whole guild believes is a<br/>
lost cause. My bard can&#39;t seem to get lost either. My wizard can get<br/>
hopelessly turned around and have to dig for a map, but my bard always can<br/>
find her way.<br/>
 The world is now known and maybe a smaller place for the knowing, but still<br/>
I enjoy running across the land, knowing I can lend a hand in almost any<br/>
situation. There is a song for everything.<br/>
