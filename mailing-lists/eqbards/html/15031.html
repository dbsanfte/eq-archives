<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215226722">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I was in unrest last night and had the unforutnate luck to be slaughtered<br/>
unrest style in the house. After hitting the bank and grabbing an extra<br/>
flute, I high tailed it into unrest to recovery my possessions. After<br/>
getting my corpse and pulling it to the wall I discovered a potentially<br/>
fatal bug for bards out there.<br/>
<br/>
I had my mino horn equiped and was playing the invis song (as I often do<br/>
while looting my corpse) As I retrieved my items I picked up my original<br/>
mino horn from my corpse. At that precise moment, Shaurii&#39;s happened to<br/>
pulse and...<br/>
<br/>
Shaurii&#39;s Sonorus Clouding stopped and said you must have a wind instrument<br/>
equpied.<br/>
<br/>
What the???<br/>
<br/>
I finished recovering my stuff and decided to test this extensively. Here<br/>
are my limited conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
If you have Mino Horn A equiped and playing Shaurii&#39;s, then you pick up Mino<br/>
Horn B and place it on your pointer, then your song pulses, your song will<br/>
drop citing your lack of a wind instrument.<br/>
<br/>
As of yet I have not tried any of this with actual flutes yet, but I was<br/>
able to replicate this bug over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
So, the moral of the story is, if you are looting while invis in a dangerous<br/>
area, be careful about picking up that wind instrument.<br/>
