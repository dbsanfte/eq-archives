in WWII.  After an extensive review of combat head injuries in<br/>
past wars, the newly redesigned U.S. Army helmets look a lot<br/>
like the German WWII helmets (better protection around the<br/>
temples and back), minus the spire on top.<br/>

After you try on a plate helm, you may decide the banded/BI<br/>
helm look is not so bad. :-)  As alternatives, you could get<br/>
a leatherfoot skullcap (quest turning in a dirk, +10 to<br/>
charisma) which has the look of leather.  Or you could get a<br/>
fine silk turban from Hatar (L20 sand giant, rare spawn,<br/>
turban is AC 10 and does not show up on your avatar).  Be<br/>
prepared to pay though - high fashion comes at a price.<br/>
