&gt; Ok you&#39;ve all convinced me.  Plus I got to actuall see one.  But I need to<br/>
&gt; know one thing.  What is the right price to pay for a Dragoon Dirk?  The<br/>
&gt; best place to get them is Felwithe right?  Its my understanding that they<br/>
&gt; come from crushbone.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br/>

fair price for one though.  See if you can get it for less though by going<br/>
right to the source!  I bet there are people camping Dvinn in Crushbone who<br/>
can&#39;t loot another one until they sell the one they&#39;re carrying, and would be<br/>
anxious to sell it quickly if someone had the cash.<br/>
