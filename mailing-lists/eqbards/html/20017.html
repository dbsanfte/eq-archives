&gt;So after I hit Eurdin for my songs it was off for the Lambents.  I realised<br/>
&gt;when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>
&gt;back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally at about 10:45 last night <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I was given two amazing weapons by a very very sweet high level bard<br/>
&gt;this weekend (as well as a few pieces of armour).  My thulian claw and<br/>
&gt;silvery war axe have been replaced with a Sainy&#39;s Claw and a Gleaming Broad<br/>
&gt;Sword (or is it short sword?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that&#39;s what I call bards luck ;)<br/>

plat for the stones...<br/>

I also had an interesting weekend.  In an unusual twist, I spent some time <br/>
on Friday in LGuk (we had been in Overthere for the past couple of weeks) in <br/>
the Assassin/Supplier room.  I hit 39 (woot!) and got a Thick Banded Belt <br/>
which I won in a roll by one point... heeh  We were going to stay and try to <br/>
get another one, but someone had to log for lunch, the rest of us got <br/>
killed, and someone stole our spawn while we were doing CR.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on Saturday I amused myself by soloing my first HG... lol  Yes, I <br/>
kited it and it took forever, but I was thrilled, and he only did 30 HP of <br/>
damage to me.  Flushed with success I then soloed a Griffon.  Same story.  <br/>
So then I decided to charm a griffon to kill an HG.  Disasterous.  <br/>
Fortunately I fled with 22hp left... hehe<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning, I had only an hour or so to kill, so I decided on my biggest <br/>
challenge.  Grimfeather!  Yes, it took forever and he caught up with me a <br/>
few times, taking me down to half health, but I killed him!  And yes a level <br/>
39 bard with a MM drum can outrun him.  Of course I was rewarded for my <br/>
efforts with a whopping 6gp and some change.  I announced to the zone that <br/>
Grimfeather was down and the Rune of Ivy he had on him was free to the first <br/>
ranger to get to the corpse.  A level 25 ranger was thrilled to get it... <br/>
=8^)<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the time I was wandering around North Karana looking for Zahal <br/>
the Vile on track, but didn&#39;t see him anywhere.  Yes, I want to earn my <br/>
whopping 5gp and Bard faction too... lol<br/>
