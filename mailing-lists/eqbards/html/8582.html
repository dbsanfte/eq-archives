Greets Operaman!  Nice to meet you in game and big thanks for your help. <br/>
<br/>
We sure do have a lot of good bards on our server. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, late in the afternoon, I was meandering north from Oasis having<br/>
hunted spectres the night before and stopped at the N. Ro plat to see what<br/>
was happening.  Also to brag and show off my new song &lt;eg&gt; to the young solo<br/>
casters who hang there for heal & meds.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am inviting everyone into my group and doing heal and mana songs for<br/>
them.  Then I look down and see this cute little lev 6 gnome caster with a<br/>
head bopper (Staff or Writhing) just like mine but smaller scale and a cool<br/>
looking blue robe (my robe id is not good enuf to know by sight and I dint<br/>
inspect but I suspect it&#39;s a pretty good one.)  So I heal and med her up and<br/>
she says mana song is nice!  And she says I have a bard too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh really? What is the name?  Weadeneye she said, do you know?  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, but only from when I do /w 40 50 all &lt;g&gt;  level 50 I think.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a small Norrath - ya never know who you are going to meet &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly the bard!<br/>

		Well met, indeed, sir! In the last three days I have run<br/>
into Sylly (twice),<br/>
		Cappenvarra (heard him bellowing through the walls of<br/>
Highkeep), Jaezebel<br/>
		(wish you had caught me with more clothes on) and now<br/>
Harmonic. A pleasure<br/>
		to meet you all!<br/>
<br/>
		I started the game playing a warrior and made a few friends<br/>
in Blackburrow<br/>
		and Everfrost. I thought that was all I should expect before<br/>
starting my<br/>
		bard. They&#39;ve all drifted away, either to different<br/>
characters, or retired<br/>
		completely. I only have one friend still on my list from my<br/>
former life and<br/>
		I seldom see him online. Life is so different now! More<br/>
rewarding, more<br/>
		social, and much more fun.<br/>
<br/>
		Harmonic, when I told my warrior friend last night that I<br/>
knew you from this<br/>
		bard list he was very jealous. To quote him, &quot;There&#39;s<br/>
nothing like that for<br/>
		warriors.&quot; Based on my experience, I have to agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
		Operaman<br/>
		Meandering Maestro<br/>
		Very fortunate to play a Bard, and on Innoruuk<br/>
