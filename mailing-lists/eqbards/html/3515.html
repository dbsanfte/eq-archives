<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050248377">Well hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
I am Liani, SongWeaver of the 16th Measure, Guardian of Faydwer in the<br/>
alternate reality that is named for Bristlebane.  I have been known to solo<br/>
on occasion but most often can be found fighting with my sister Jyora, her<br/>
betrothed Tyldaryn and my own beloved Theodoric.  The four of us have a<br/>
personal vendetta against all orcs and will pause to slay any that cross our<br/>
path.  Whereever I am is my least favorite place to die at the hands of evil<br/>
and at the moment, we fight in the icy halls of Castle Permafrost.  If I<br/>
recall correctly, the gods have been kind to me in that I have always had<br/>
good friends at my side to protect me as I retrieved my belongings and hence<br/>
have neer died in doing so.  However I do not believe I have been so blessed<br/>
as to pass even a single measure of skill without paying for it with my life<br/>
at least once.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I refer to the practice of playing several songs at once to gain<br/>
the benefits of all as Juggling.  I personally have no use for a Dragoon<br/>
Dirk as the long sword and the axe are my weapons of choice, though my<br/>
beloved has one that he seems quite fond of.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that is everything.  Feel free to ask if I have missed any of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
