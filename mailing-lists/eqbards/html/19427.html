*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on<br/>
the Test Server:<br/>
<br/>
*General*<br/>
<br/>
- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark<br/>
spell vendors.<br/>
- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon<br/>
zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br/>
- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain<br/>
Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br/>
- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle,<br/>
Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br/>
- Upon review we&#39;ve increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.<br/>
They should be more plentiful now. <br/>
- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and<br/>
other NPCs to get around the zones.<br/>
<br/>
*Items*<br/>
<br/>
- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.<br/>
Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword<br/>
out for a working one.<br/>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession<br/>
when you leave the game.<br/>
- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br/>
- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*<br/>
<br/>
Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or<br/>
stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now<br/>
automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive<br/>
spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before<br/>
attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than<br/>
desirable.  <br/>
<br/>
Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different<br/>
than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as<br/>
other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Risk and Reward*<br/>
<br/>
The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.<br/>
Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide<br/>
substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we&#39;ve been identifying areas<br/>
in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary<br/>
adjustments. <br/>
<br/>
In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a<br/>
specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded<br/>
in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated<br/>
with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the<br/>
reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week<br/>
with the Burning Rapier quest.  <br/>
<br/>
However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of<br/>
the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above<br/>
as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary<br/>
and stationary outdoor creature has a &quot;fast spawn&quot;, yielding the reward of<br/>
fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <br/>
<br/>
Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did<br/>
want to let you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next<br/>
several weeks.<br/>
<br/>
*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*<br/>
<br/>
As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and<br/>
Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.<br/>
Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen,<br/>
whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek<br/>
post-production, we&#39;ve decided to allow characters on both servers a<br/>
one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT<br/>
on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm<br/>
PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing<br/>
the &quot;/movelog yes&quot; command during the registration window.  There is no<br/>
limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and<br/>
Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not<br/>
be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week,<br/>
at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not<br/>
moved in a character-move, so we&#39;d recommend against leaving unclaimed<br/>
corpses around after Monday of next week if you&#39;ve asked to be moved. <br/>
<br/>
Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message<br/>
Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br/>
