classes in this game can stop a train - bards and enchanters,<br/>
and bards do it by using Lullaby (or charm or Pixie Strike,<br/>
but those are level 27 and 28).  If you *ever* find yourself<br/>
fighting more than one mob at a time, this song will help.  <br/>
The only caveat is that your group *must* attack only one<br/>
target at a time, and a healer is *highly* desirable because<br/>
all the monsters will really hate you for putting them to<br/>
sleep.<br/>
