<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714331186">Sorry if I babble here, but I agree totally with the post.  Different armor<br/>
types should offer different forms of protection.  And historically, new<br/>
armors and weapons were created in an almost medieval arms race, one type<br/>
designed to combat another.  Like paper scissors stone.  Have heathens with<br/>
swords?  Invent some plate armor.  Bows killing you&#39;re troops?  Invent tower<br/>
shields.  All that medieval stuff came about over time, like the stealth<br/>
bomber in reaction to radar technology.  No radar, no stealth bomber.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, did you know that the proliferation of blunt weapons came about as<br/>
a way to combat knights in plate?  Imagine a big bell vibrating, and you get<br/>
the picture.  Various blunt weapons were invented with the design and<br/>
purpose of &quot;crushing&quot; men in plate.  When plate armor wasn&#39;t around, there<br/>
was no need for such heavy and clumsy weapons (though being the first weapon<br/>
in existance, were around), for a sword was much more efficient and deadly.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the invention of the crossbow came about as another anti-knight<br/>
weapon.  There was only one reason anyone needed a bow-type weapon with such<br/>
ridiculous velocity: to pierce plate.  A knight would train his whole life,<br/>
and be taken down by a fellow who had trained with his crossbow for a week.<br/>
Crossbowmen were often despised for this reason, and for the fact they would<br/>
hide in windows and shadows, never to fight with chivalry as knight&#39;s were<br/>
accustomed.  The crossbow, unlike the bow, ended up being a very easy weapon<br/>
to master... an added bonus.  (The Mongols, though not using crossbows,<br/>
rained arrows down on knights from above, with enough velocity to pierce<br/>
plate as well.)<br/>
<br/>
Most game systems wouldn&#39;t use a system based on this: Plated warriors<br/>
nearly invulnerable unless you hid and shot at them with a crossbow, or took<br/>
them on with a mace.  A mace wielder then ineffective against a faster<br/>
fellow with a stilleto (round one: guy with a heavy mace lying dead).  A<br/>
rock-scissors-paper type game would be very interesting, though EQ ain&#39;t it.<br/>
Real medieval weapons were designed to kill an opponent, if properly<br/>
wielded, in one shot (at least as often as possible, though only<br/>
dismembering or incapacitating sufficed as a kill).  And imagine mastering<br/>
your crossbow at level 4, hmm.  Strict medieval realism might never be in a<br/>
game, though it would be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
But I enjoy EQ&#39;s system, don&#39;t get me wrong, heheh.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most gaming systems factor in some real life concepts about what type of<br/>
&gt;damage armor can and cannot protect against. Assuming that there are three<br/>
&gt;types of damage (slash, pierce, and blunt) various armors protect various<br/>
&gt;ways. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard, most of these are factored in here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cloth armor isn&#39;t really gonna do much since it is easy to puncture, easy<br/>
&gt;to cut through, and offers very little padding to slow the impact of<br/>
&gt;something big and round.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Patchwork usually provides a bit more protection against slash and blunt<br/>
&gt;since it is slightly thicker than cloth. Piercing it may not improve<br/>
&gt;against.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The various leathers (rawhide and normal) are better against piercing and<br/>
&gt;much better against slashing because of the toughness of it. Some are often<br/>
&gt;padded decently so it takes the edge off of blunt damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Studded leather would most likely improve upon slashing since the metal<br/>
&gt;studs would help stop the blade but wouldn&#39;t do much for piercing since the<br/>
&gt;studs cover such a small area. Blunt might actually hurt more if it hits<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of the studs and drives it into your chest. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reinforced is the same thing but now there is more surface area to stop<br/>
&gt;piercing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ring mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>
&gt;metal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>
&gt;and allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>
&gt;seeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>
&gt;the big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>
&gt;reduced to whatever padding is underneath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chain is the same as ring but usually has tigher links making it a bit<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Banded, similar to splint and scale in other game systems, improves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>against<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;piercers quite a bit now that most of those holes are filled up. Still some<br/>
&gt;between the plates though. Slashing prolly isn&#39;t much better than chain but<br/>
&gt;blunt is probably better now that you have plates of metal that won&#39;t give<br/>
&gt;as easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plate, of course, is usually considered the best. It offers very good<br/>
&gt;protection against slashers since it is often hard to cut metal. Blunt is<br/>
&gt;really good since you have that rigitity of a real big piece of metal.<br/>
&gt;Piercing is better since there are relatively few holes to sneak through<br/>
&gt;unless you want to try and force the point of a dagger or rapier through a<br/>
&gt;quarter inch of steel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; Hello all . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>
&gt;it if anyone can help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AC continues to be a mystery. It seems to be no more than an overall armor<br/>
&gt;rating, which increases with level and with type of armor, and exists only<br/>
&gt;so that I can compare AC values with jealous people who still have<br/>
&gt;patchwork. Does AC really have a meaning? If so, what does the total AC<br/>
&gt;value mean? What does the AC value of a single piece of armor mean?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I know from experience that as soon as I went to full banded, my<br/>
&gt;ability to take damage skyrocketed. All of the sudden things which used to<br/>
&gt;destroy me just kept missing me or hitting me for 1 damage. This seems to<br/>
&gt;suggest it has nothing to do with AC value, and everything to do with armor<br/>
&gt;type. The fact that the banded &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 25 from<br/>
&gt;patchwork was irrelevant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now my bronze &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 15, a small amount compared<br/>
&gt;to my overall AC, but again my ability to take damage jumped significantly.<br/>
&gt;I can again solo everything that is blue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read somewhere that each different type of armor (Leather, Chain, Plate<br/>
&gt;and its equivalents) can absorb more and different types of damage as the<br/>
&gt;armor gets better. This seems to be true, and seems to make the AC value<br/>
&gt;worthless . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Besides, full bronze looks really cool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please comment . . .<br/>
