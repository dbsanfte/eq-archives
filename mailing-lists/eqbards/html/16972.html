<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140984506">Perhaps he means shimmering orb - AC 15 equips as a shield.  I got one that<br/>
I use in the Planes.  I can stand in the melee and not worry about getting<br/>
excessive attention.  With 6 Note and Yk, I would draw attention and take<br/>
damage.  Then I went to 6NB and Dragoon Dirk.  Then I got the Shimmering Orb<br/>
and enjoy the ac boost and can pretty much melee the whole time. My personal<br/>
opinion is that my greatest value to my group and our team is my delivery of<br/>
mana.  If i die, it&#39;s a big waste of time and mana and adds to instead of<br/>
reducing the down time.  Plus I am totally sick of dying.  Sure 49/50 res<br/>
gets you 80-90% xp back but 4 deaths with exp res&#39;s is still over half a bub<br/>
and at 48 thats *hours* of boring camping blues.  So my focus is on survial,<br/>
mana delivery and what ever additional buffs or resists are required.<br/>

&gt; Taunt on the orb is huge, and it goes off a lot.  Great weapon when<br/>

&gt; Every 50th level bard I know<br/>
&gt; tells me that what I&#39;m really going to want short of planes weapons is an<br/>
&gt; orb or duel EBWs so I can still damage without the taunt.  We&#39;ll see :) </span></blockquote></div>
