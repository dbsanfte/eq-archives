<div id="ygrps-yiv-107804463">I would have to disagree.  I have used COD as part of my weave for a long<br/>
while.  It takes patience and practice though as it can be very dangerous if<br/>
you are not careful.  With that, warsong, and Rythyms I can solo the yellow<br/>
Shraloks in Kithicor, including the caster without kiting.  You&#39;d be amazed<br/>
how much difference that extra damage makes.  Also when you get two blues on<br/>
you its a big help to be hurting the one you aren&#39;t hitting, since he&#39;s<br/>
beating on you anyhow.<br/>

     What!  gasp!  You mean I&#39;m not the only 30+ year old in the game...<br/>
     Yea!  There is hope for me after all...<br/>
     <br/>
     Bujold  17 level soon to be 16th.... <br/>
     (had a bad night, I actually took someone&#39;s advice on this list and <br/>
     tried weaving Discord into my combat stack and proceed to get pounded. <br/>
     I don&#39;t mean to be rude but those AOE damage spells are only good for <br/>
     harvesting IMHO)<br/>

Ah, Michael. Thank you SO MUCH for the nice &quot;lift me up&quot;. I have so much to <br/>
look forward to! (smile).<br/>
     <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d rather know AHEAD of time, rather than getting there, saying <br/>
&quot;What the...&quot; and then annoying GMs about it. &quot;My XP bar is bugged!!! <br/>
Someone help me!!&quot;. Yeah... sure.... heheheh<br/>
     <br/>
At level 30, I saw it first hand. It WAS slower to level, took several days <br/>
rather than the typical couple of days. There were many times I would say to<br/>
<br/>
my party, &#39;Guys.... it&#39;s moving... backwards.... argh... someone... help... <br/>
me....&quot;<br/>
     <br/>
That does bring me to another point: Love how a lot of players, who see that<br/>
<br/>
you are above 30th, call me a &quot;power leveller&quot;.  I kinda squint my eyes <br/>
because, though I understand what they are trying to imply, I have NO idea <br/>
HOW to &quot;power level&quot;. I kill things that are blue to red for me. I get XP. I<br/>
<br/>
gain levels. I do all of this while hunting for rare items and hanging out <br/>
with friends. It&#39;s almost as though they insinuate that I &quot;cheat&quot; to level, <br/>
or have some unfair advantage to levelling. I guess sometimes I DO have an <br/>
advantage: it&#39;s called a group. A group of friends. I have ALWAYS made <br/>
better level progress while grouped than I do while solo. Some bards have <br/>
claimed great success while soloing. Guess I fit into the geriatric list of <br/>
30+ year olds who play this game who just CAN&#39;T SOLO. I find it difficult, <br/>
unexciting, and frustrating. Most of these people (though I admit, less than<br/>
<br/>
a dozen) who accuse me of &quot;power levelling&quot; have been seen running around <br/>
solo. Well, my friends, drop the attitude, and get a group. Be loyal to that<br/>
<br/>
group, and level yourself. That, or quit being jealous (smile)<br/>
     <br/>
Anyway, I am bored, so thought I would rant a bit. Thanks!<br/>

&gt;&gt; I, myself, made 35th level last night, which I have learned <br/>
&gt;&gt; is the second of<br/>
&gt;&gt; at least three &quot;hell levels&quot; where your experience is somehow <br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;watered down&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; to slow you down. 30th level was like this, but I am told <br/>
&gt;&gt; 35th is worse, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; 40th is worse still. Don&#39;t know anyone on my server to have <br/>
&gt;&gt; reached 45th or<br/>
&gt;&gt; 49th to tell me whether they are the same, as well. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;49th is the same as any other level, just hard to find stuff that gives you<br/>
<br/>
&gt;exp, since a lot of stuff is green that used to be blue.  45th is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>definitely<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a hell level, and is the worst.  Took me 10 days to get from 45 to 46, <br/>
&gt;playing every day several hours.  Half-bubble to a bubble for a long game <br/>
&gt;day is a good thing.  Getting a bubble at 45 is like getting a whole normal<br/>
<br/>
&gt;level it feels like.  Bet you can&#39;t wait now hehe.<br/>
