<b>Subject:</b> bard skill cap (singing vs melee) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323829278">Well, I second John Kim&#39;s proposal to add the &quot;Why do our song skills cap at<br/>
200?&quot; plank to the petition.  It would seem logical that since even the<br/>
&quot;majik gudd&quot; shaman races are able to cap out at 250.<br/>
<br/>
By way of compromise, I could see the instruments going to 225 and perhaps<br/>
singing to 255, but its not like we can send a delegation to the table to<br/>
debate terms of surrender with Verant. :)<br/>

PS:    Verant means hybrid to be &quot;not of the 4 prime classes&quot; - which for us<br/>
old D&D guys means cleric, mage, warrior and thief.  By extension you can<br/>
see the subclasses of mage (heck, even TSR gave you 3 varieties right out of<br/>
the box).</div>
