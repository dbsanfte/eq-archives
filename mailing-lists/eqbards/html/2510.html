from Verant is too hard and takes too long.  I understand that they have a<br/>
problem with staff versus the number of players, and I have no doubt that<br/>
far too many of player attempts to get attention deserve a quick brush off<br/>
to play the game rather than look to officials for hints and in-game help.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, they are not doing a very good job of helping people with<br/>
legitimate problems that, as in your case, lead to hours or days of being<br/>
unable to play.  Verant needs to find a way to get communication and<br/>
legitimate help flowing back to the players.<br/>
