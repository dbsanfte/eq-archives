<div id="ygrps-yiv-147479150">Sure the granularity could be refined, but you get the USA Today perception <br/>
of bards, which may be the general perception of bards. :-P<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me when I visited Neutral Ground a while back and watched a group <br/>
hunting in Karnor&#39;s I think. This one cleric was just sitting and cussing <br/>
about a bard twisting with an instrument in his group just because she was <br/>
swinging away with hand to hand combat. He just felt that the bard was a <br/>
wasted slot anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Interesting perception about bard&#39;s on Allakhazam&#39;s poll:<br/>

&gt; &gt;You can bypass voting if you want by just clicking on &quot;View the Results&quot;. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t mean to start a grip session. As a bard I consider us quite powerful,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but then again, I&#39;m level 38 and pretty much loving life as I&#39;m able to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;all the things a bard can, without just getting the &quot;sing manasong only&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;too often.<br/>
