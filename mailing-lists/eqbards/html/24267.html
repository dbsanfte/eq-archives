<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114301895">If you&#39;re doing dreadlands to solo try pullin only ragers, petrified birdied<br/>
(these i found were better) and brutes... spiders can be good too but a real<br/>
pain in the butt.  Try the spider webs near FV zone as there&#39;s lotsa<br/>
widows/recluse there. As well as roaming petrified birds there with other<br/>
stuff.  Sadly, I&#39;ve found that in the wee hours of the morning dreadlands<br/>
and karnors have been the easiest spots to find a group/solo. Which ever was<br/>
my mood that morning.  I know there are better spots but I don&#39;t like<br/>
wasting my time running around/gating in order to get to  these spots and<br/>
seeing that they&#39;re camped.  One of these spots being the bloodgills in lake<br/>
of ill omen. They&#39;re great xp and you can tank them and go toe to toe with<br/>
them. I finished my level 49 on them.  Have about 6 ancient coins sitting in<br/>
the bank from them.<br/>

Speaking of which, anyone have good spots for experience at 48-50ish?  I<br/>
usually duo with a monk and we have a regen tunic at our disposal.<br/>
However, I also want to be able to solo in the mornings on weekends, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We tried Dreadlands, mobs too low blue to get good xp, hit really hard.  Sol<br/>
b was great and would still be good except for the crowded factor and I dont<br/>
think I can solo bats, even if I get a solo pull.<br/>
<br/>
GD is too green, as is EW.  Let me know your ideas please :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve gotten really nice Experience (probably as much from <br/>
&gt; frequency of pulls<br/>
&gt; and fast disposition of mobs) in the Hand Room...<br/>

&gt; i dunno, at least on saryrn pickup groups in the mid 50&#39;s <br/>
&gt; still seem to be<br/>
&gt; fairly<br/>
&gt; competent.  karnors sucks for exp, btw, you know that most of <br/>
&gt; the mobs in<br/>
&gt; there range from 39 to the low 40&#39;s right?  i&#39;d suggest <br/>
&gt; parking your bard in<br/>
&gt; sebilis and trying to get a group, and if that doesn&#39;t work, <br/>
&gt; play your alt.<br/>
