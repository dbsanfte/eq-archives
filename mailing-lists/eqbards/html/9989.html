<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535903524"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
&gt;WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>

&gt;My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful.<br/>
&gt;especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that dog<br/>
&gt;that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Druids get track at 20.  They get to put one practice point into it, and <br/>
there it stays, never improving.  Yet it IS useful, sometimes even more <br/>
useful than high level ranger tracking. This is because the druid tracks <br/>
what is nearby, the ranger tracks what is on the other side of the zone.  <br/>
Many times I&#39;ve had rangers tell me high level tracking sucks.  In this one <br/>
instance, maybe bards got the best deal of all - mid range tracking. :)<br/>
