<div id="ygrps-yiv-141294621">hiya, just killing time at work so i figured i&#39;d ask this question.  First<br/>
off let me state that my main character is a necro, lev 52 and that my bard<br/>
lev 36 has been on the shelf for over 6 months. I dunno about all of you but<br/>
i find 50+ levels to be extremely depressing, i feel like im taking one step<br/>
forward 2 steps back. I find that in general all classes become extremely<br/>
powerfull over 50 but its brain numbing repetition. I been playing my little<br/>
warrior (almost 14 with 400hp weeee). Its kinda cool to play a warrior, i<br/>
did 2 crippling blows in a row for 96 dmg to a kodiak at lev 12, i was in<br/>
shock. <br/>
<br/>
But anyways, the reason im writing this is because im thinking of restarting<br/>
my bard, but he&#39;s nekked (i stripped him when i started my necro). You have<br/>
anything that you could suggest to re-equip with that is easy to obtain with<br/>
my big boy necro? i need armor and weapons. He&#39;s got lambent arms or bracer<br/>
still, and shin pants and gloves and his mask still, and i think he has a<br/>
barbute too, not sure. I was thinkin of goin to guk to get a carapace maybe<br/>
for a bp till i get him something better. Any suggestions of something i can<br/>
solo easily with my necro to give to him?  and weapons.... all i have is a<br/>
fs long sword hehe (if only my wakizashies on my ranger were not no drop).<br/>
maybe i could go terrorize the avatar of fear or something, but im hoping to<br/>
avoid the claw. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as i think its<br/>
time to take the dust off that old drummer boy. I think i&#39;d like to go to<br/>
hate one day with that bard<br/>
<br/>
Your opinions/suggestions will not be taken lightly and will be greatly<br/>
appreciated<br/>
