<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-295762695">I don&#39;t see kiting as a problem - never done it myself - but then - I was<br/>
primarily a tradesman anyway and have given my account away to a friend who<br/>
DOES like to monster bash since Verant raped the trade skills - but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Why am I still on this list?  Well, I have a dream - a dream of making a<br/>
game like what *I* think folks want to play - and I keep my ears open to<br/>
lessons learned elsewhere - I digress again.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what needs to be done about training IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Monster latches onto target and does not switch unless attacked. If<br/>
acquired target is lost - they pop back to spawn point.<br/>
<br/>
This would end the practice of training as antisocial behavior. It might<br/>
also end kiting, if you get so far away from the MOB, perhaps make it so<br/>
you can outrun them - but have to be closer than most try to do it. Let<br/>
kiters continue their tactics - but if they find all of a sudden that if<br/>
they outdistance the MOB they all of a sudden have to turn around and go<br/>
back to the spawn point - I think you&#39;ll see this behavior modified to some<br/>
extent.<br/>
<br/>
This would also make it quite interesting for campers back at the spawn<br/>
point - no need for a ubermonster to spawn to clear camp sites - would<br/>
certainly make it a bit more challenging to just sit on your butt and camp<br/>
a site with folks pulling it clear constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Verant went a long way to prevent antisocial behavior - one reason I<br/>
started EQ in the first place. Now, they need to observe and figure out<br/>
what other ways pinheads insist on being jerks - and address those if<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, purposeful training is right at the top of the list.<br/>
<br/>
This change would also help bards - if not everyone they pass is added to<br/>
the shitlist - perhaps it would help with that problem too.<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02.<br/>

&gt;this. On Veeshan, people train Spectre&#39;s for<br/>

&gt;are non-existant so what the heck? </span></blockquote></div>
