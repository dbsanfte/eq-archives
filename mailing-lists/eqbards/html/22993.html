<div id="ygrps-yiv-836188150">That&#39;s the most amazing thing.  Okay - there are a lot of classes and a lot<br/>
of things to test - and things will get missed.  I can live with that.<br/>
<br/>
	But what&#39;s the point of even having a test server - and having people<br/>
report bugs if you&#39;re going to ignore them?  Pretty sad..<br/>

You would also think that they test stuff or at least listen to the folks<br/>
who do. Well, not if you have been playing EQ for very long - they dont test<br/>
well at all - who knows why - never have - maybe never will.<br/>
<br/>
This whole Selos problem *was reported one the Test server*! Way before the<br/>
recent patch.  It was a reported problem on Test.<br/>
