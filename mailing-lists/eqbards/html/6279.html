&gt; Someone stated earlier that there are only 2 high level <br/>
&gt; dungeons for all <br/>
&gt; those lvl 50&#39;s out there.  Well actually there are many more, <br/>
&gt; the cities of <br/>
&gt; races that are KoS to you and your friends.  I have already <br/>
&gt; seen Teir&#39;dal in <br/>
&gt; North Freeport killing the paladins there.  I know of at <br/>
&gt; least 2 attempts by <br/>
&gt; good players to breach the gates of Neriak.  Personally I am <br/>
&gt; looking forward <br/>
&gt; to storming the foul holes the Trolls and Orges call home.<br/>
