I&#39;ve LONG said that pure instrument attack (where we can pull it off) is far<br/>
more effective than weapons ;)<br/>
<br/>
If they find out I dread the nerfing that will occur.  I still remember the<br/>
godawful nerfing that went on in beta when they found out we could stack our<br/>
Warsong with the Chant of Battle type songs... (Can you say 40% speedup?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord: 33 + 4 (McVaxius&#39; Horn of War) + -AC to mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation: 50 + 2 (Gypsy Lute) + -atk speed to mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Effect: 122 dam/target/round<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chords of Cessation with a lute does more damage than I do<br/>
&gt; with my weapons.  I tested it against some L8 mobs, took them<br/>
&gt; to half, then fought with weapons and added up the damage.<br/>
&gt; The 50 figure above is about right.  To compare, that&#39;s about<br/>
&gt; 9 damage/sec.  My weapons test against the Allizewsaur yielded<br/>
&gt; only about 7-8 damage/sec (admittedly against a L50 mob).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CoC + CoD do so much damage, that using them with a lute does<br/>
&gt; more damage than using them with weapons.  It took 10 attack<br/>
&gt; rounds (36 seconds) of these two with a lute for me to take a<br/>
&gt; wan down to half.  It took 14 attack rounds (45 sec) for me to<br/>
&gt; beat it the rest of the way with my weapons and singing these<br/>
&gt; two songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The 122 dam/target/round Rokenn lists above works out to 1220<br/>
&gt; damage/minute.  This is *on par* with two of the top necro<br/>
&gt; DoTs stacked.  You can do a helluva lot of damage with these<br/>
&gt; songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hymn + Niv&#39;s at 47 heal 29 points/tick.  At 48, it is 33<br/>
&gt; points/tick (tick = 6 seconds).  Over a 2 minute solo fight,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s 660 points I&#39;m healing, and thus 660 &quot;extra&quot; hp I get.<br/>
&gt; In comparison, Resolution is only about 200 points, Symbol of<br/>
&gt; Piznarn is about 300 points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Using Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, and CoD with a lute, I&#39;ve been soloing<br/>
&gt; greater kobolds and wan knights losing about 0.5-1.5 bubbles.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been soloing Solusek kobolds and zols losing about 2-3<br/>
&gt; bubbles.  Yes, that&#39;s right, you can solo once you hit 48<br/>
&gt; without having to resort to charming or Pixie Striking.  The<br/>
&gt; only fights that gave me problems were a high level SK armed<br/>
&gt; with a FS 2h sword, a high level zol also armed with a 2h<br/>
&gt; sword (both too high level for me to charm), and a fight with<br/>
&gt; a zol where an urd jumped in (had to throw charm into the<br/>
&gt; above 4-song medley - finished at a half bubble, thought the<br/>
&gt; next hit from the zol was going to kill me and instead it just<br/>
&gt; fell over and died).  It is sick just how much more effective<br/>
&gt; I am using these songs instead of my weapons.  I don&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; about planes weapons anymore - I want a 7-stringed lute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the DoTs turn out to be 3 ticks like I think they are, then<br/>
&gt; I plan to see if I can arrange a Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, CoD, DDD<br/>
&gt; combo.<br/>
