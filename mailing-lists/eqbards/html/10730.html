<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169646297">This would be true if they gated out of the zone, but noooooo, these beight<br/>
ones gated to the zone entry.  Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>
immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>
SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>
only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>

PS Yes Unrest is famous for trains.  None of the ones I have seen were<br/>
caused by speedy runners but by stupid parties.  Its the lower level,<br/>
greater incompetence, and large agro radius that causes horrible trains in<br/>
Unrest.  The more pickup groups that are in a zone the more trains there<br/>
are.  The worst trains of all occur in Guk where it is underground.  Being<br/>
above ground is not the train causing factor at least in Unrest, never spent<br/>
any time in Mistmoore so not sure about there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not quite.  They are not concerned about you avoiding a train.  They don&#39;t<br/>
want you pulling huge trains to zone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>
&gt; not I fail to see.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instantaneous travel doesn&#39;t cause the train to keep running to zone.  Fast<br/>
travel allows someone to lead the entire dungeon to the<br/>
zone exit, causing many people to die.<br/>
<br/>
Think about some of the worst zones for random deaths from trains,<br/>
Mistmoore, Unrest, BlackBurrow.  All these zones are &quot;outdoors&quot;<br/>
and allow speed effects.  The trainmaker can run fast and make it to zone,<br/>
and lets everyone else deal with the trainwreck.<br/>
<br/>
In the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are usually less trains to<br/>
zone (there are exceptions).  This is because the person<br/>
who gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make it to zone.  They will<br/>
die 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>
<br/>
A caster gating out has the same effect as death.  The monster drops the<br/>
player off the hate list.  Unless someone else is also on<br/>
the hate list (or too close), the monster will return to it&#39;s normal spot.<br/>
