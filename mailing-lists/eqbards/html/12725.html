<div id="ygrps-yiv-617953683"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; BTW about getting a character buffed to your present level on test? dont<br/>
&gt; hold your breath...they havent done anything like that since the population<br/>
&gt; explosion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The test server is for testing, if they don&#39;t understand that -<br/>
  then I won&#39;t bother wasting my time.  It does seem that those <br/>
  few people who play on the test server and invested time into<br/>
  a character feel bad about importing a L50 character into it.<br/>
  I completely understand your position, but I&#39;ve earned all my<br/>
  levels already, there&#39;s no surprise or falsity in copying my<br/>
  bard to test.  You kind make it sound like you&#39;ve earned your<br/>
  levels on the test server, so everyone else would have to.  I<br/>
  don&#39;t want to play there, I simply want to test there.<br/>
 <br/>
  The truth is at L16 you cannot really test the majority of the<br/>
  changes that are going on as of late.  By promoting a character<br/>
  straight to L50, you cut the anticipation of getting new songs<br/>
  by just giving it all to them.  That is bad.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve done it all, leveled frustratingly, and have all the song<br/>
  knowledge from experience.  You&#39;re right, it makes too much sense<br/>
  to do something practical like give an already L50 bard the<br/>
  privledge to test out his songs on a non-live server.<br/>
<br/>
  And I had a level 10 monk on the test server... made level 10<br/>
  in about 10 mins via guide buffing.  So obviously, they don&#39;t<br/>
  mind upping levels.<br/>
