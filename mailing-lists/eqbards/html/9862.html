<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695476364">Today I was attacked in Beholder&#39;s Maze by a magician&#39;s pet that had been<br/>
charmed by an evil eye (I assume, at least :)  It was red to me, and it<br/>
kept rooting me, or whatever it&#39;s specific spell. I never resisted or<br/>
anything :(  I had no clue what to do, just kept singing Hymn for a<br/>
while.  Finally, at about 2 bbls of health left, I realized I had<br/>
Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion memorized, and tried it out just to see if it<br/>
would work.  It did!!! I was able to back up the 2 feet to the zone and<br/>
start breathing again.  Does this song break other types of roots?<br/>

&gt; &gt; GZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.  We had it<br/>
&gt; &gt; breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful, since it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a free song that bards keep mem&#39;d all the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we had all suspected that Selo&#39;s breaking root had been deliberately<br/>
&gt; changed while they were in fixing the Selo&#39;s/SoW issues.  Selo&#39;s breaking<br/>
&gt; root *was* very powerful, as you not only broke root but were in Turbo Mode<br/>
&gt; when it broke.  That said, the song that we wouldn&#39;t keep memmed all the<br/>
&gt; time and that *should* break root is Disenchanting Melody, and it&#39;s broken.<br/>
&gt; So let&#39;s hope ADM gets fixed very soon.<br/>
