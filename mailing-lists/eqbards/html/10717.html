&gt; Subject: Selos and trains underground<br/>
&gt;In the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are<br/>
&gt;usually less trains<br/>
&gt;to zone (there are exceptions).  This is because the<br/>
&gt;person<br/>
&gt;who gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make<br/>
&gt;it to zone.  They<br/>
&gt;will die 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A caster gating out has the same effect as death. <br/>
&gt;The monster drops<br/>
&gt;the player off the hate list.  Unless someone else is<br/>
&gt;also on<br/>
&gt;the hate list (or too close), the monster will return<br/>
&gt;to it&#39;s normal<br/>
&gt;spot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not always true. We had a real jerk bind himself just<br/>
inside the zone in lower guk, head DEEP inside, whack<br/>
one frog, and gate. The ensuing trained killed almost<br/>
everyone between frog #1 and the zone. Gate is only<br/>
safer when used by non-idiots - an all too rare<br/>
commodity these days. I for one, would love to play on<br/>
an adults only server. Make you have to prove you&#39;re<br/>
over 18, maybe pass an IQ test first. Maybe have<br/>
stricter rules and make it easy to get booted off the<br/>
server. You wouldn&#39;t be banned from eq, just from the<br/>
one server.  That&#39;d be so nice, a server with no<br/>
stupid children shouting to zone, causing trains,<br/>
typing without using consonants, swearing flagrantly,<br/>
etc. Too bad it would never happen.<br/>
