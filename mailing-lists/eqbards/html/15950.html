&gt; So what happens with this point system when non guild members are hunting <br/>
&gt; with you?  On my server (The Rathe) some of the more powerful guilds use <br/>
&gt; this method for distributing planes goodies.  The problem occurs when others <br/>
&gt; are there with them and they still apply their &quot;point&quot; system to looting.  <br/>
&gt; As most of their guild has been going to the planes since they opened late <br/>
&gt; last summer if other people go that aren&#39;t in that guild they usually get <br/>
&gt; squat.  This has led to MANY arguments between guilds.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The multi-guild group I often play with is thinking of<br/>
instituting a system similar to Shada&#39;s guild&#39;s.  A tossed in<br/>
a couple ideas for incorporating new/random guests relatively<br/>
fairly.<br/>
<br/>
One idea was rather than make it a most-points-wins system,<br/>
turn it into a weighted lotto.  If person A has 15 points, B<br/>
has 7 points, C has 4 points, and visitor D has 2 points, then<br/>
you do a /random 1 28.  1-15, A wins; 16-22, B wins; 23-26, C<br/>
wins; 26-27 D wins.  I&#39;m trying to figure out a simpler way to<br/>
do this that automatically incorporates the weighting without<br/>
requiring you to do the math.<br/>
<br/>
I also suggested scaling the points down so people who go to a<br/>
lot of these events don&#39;t have an overwhelming advantage over<br/>
people who can&#39;t go as often.  If you have 1-10 points, each<br/>
dragon/god trip is worth 1 point.  If you have 11-20 points,<br/>
you need two trips to gain an extra point.  If you have 21-30,<br/>
you need three trips per point.  etc.<br/>
<br/>
Planes armor should be relatively simple if you can trust the<br/>
people there.  Just have each person take the number of planes<br/>
trips they&#39;ve been on (scaling as above if you like), divide<br/>
it by the number of planes armor pieces you have, multiply it<br/>
by the total number of planes armor slots (8?), and that&#39;s<br/>
your integer weighting for the /random.<br/>
<br/>
