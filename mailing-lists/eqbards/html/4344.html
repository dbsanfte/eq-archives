<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832990033">Nixx Nenix - or whatever his name is - is not new. He killed me in Paw<br/>
a few months ago. He has been on my list of NPCs to kill for quite some<br/>
time.<br/>

&quot;I found the same thing in Paw a couple of weeks ago.  There was a<br/>
darkelf necromancer named Nixx Nenix roaming Paw.  I was just coming<br/>
out after<br/>
successfully defeating Shaman Ren Rex and saw a dark elf swimming.  I<br/>
figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over<br/>
time(DOT). I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out<br/>
and theDOT still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571<br/>
hit points at level 19).&quot;</div>
