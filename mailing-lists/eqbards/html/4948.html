<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686876648">I&#39;m also told that the exp. penalty becomes more noticable at mid-levels<br/>
and up and that thet difference in a human hybrid and an &quot;other&quot; hybrid<br/>
(specifically Paladin, SK players) gets to be noticable.  I spoke just<br/>
yesterday to someone who switched from a Troll SK to a Human Paladin (same<br/>
hybrid penalty, but no race penalty) since they had gotten frustrated at<br/>
L15+.   I don&#39;t know if the Bard has as significant a penalty as some of<br/>
the hybrids (my Bards stay low leveled because this middle aged person has<br/>
a skill cap on her mash key skill).  I also think from personal experience<br/>
(empirical data only!) that some races may have more/less of an exp.<br/>
penalty.  Though access to good non-overcrowded hunting grounds with a<br/>
spawn rate exceeding your rest time seems to have a bigger effect on<br/>
ability and time to level than any bonus/penalty IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Though I agree with the personal preference option.  Also the vision may be<br/>
more of an issue with a Bard since many of the caster classes get vision<br/>
spells and/or light spells.  Some of the light spells at L1, and vision<br/>
spells as early a L9.<br/>
