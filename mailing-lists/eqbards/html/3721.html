Hmmm. Seems to me there is one more influence on the halfling design than<br/>
what was mentioned by my esteemed colleague Qefnir:<br/>
The Lone Ranger!<br/>
Jeeeze. Someone please tell what this is about. I near about pee all over<br/>
myself every time I go through that part of the world,  just seeing those<br/>
halflings with the masks.<br/>
<br/>
Acinonyx of Bristlebane<br/>
*<br/>
* And because I see no evidence of the definition of the Halfling race in EQ<br/>
it&#39;s safe to assume they are either Middle-Earth-style or TSR-style </span></blockquote></div>
