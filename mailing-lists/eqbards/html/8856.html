<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502311307">I found a lambent stone on the first giant I killed, then had a mini-drought.  I would say from<br/>
my experience, which is four lambent stones worth, that about one in four giants in Rathe<br/>
Mountains seems to drop a stone.  This seems to be higher than the reported incidence from other<br/>
bards though.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m finding it easier to get the armor quest components versus getting a<br/>
&gt; lambent stones.  So far I have five quest components.  I have been<br/>
&gt; auctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the patch came out.  I have<br/>
&gt; tried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once has anyone had one to<br/>
&gt; sell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for them.  Despite killing<br/>
&gt; numerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one.  Do lambent stones only<br/>
&gt; get dropped in specific zones or can they get dropped in any zone with a<br/>
&gt; giant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests in order to sell the<br/>
&gt; lambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I guess its possible that<br/>
&gt; people are hanging on to lambent stones so they can complete the quests.  I<br/>
&gt; know most of the quest components are NO DROP but I can&#39;t remember if the<br/>
&gt; lambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this for me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
