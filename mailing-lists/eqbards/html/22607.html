While you are learning dual wield you want to have your fastest weapon in<br/>
your off hand.  This will allow more skill checks, allowing you to increase<br/>
the skill faster.<br/>
<br/>
Once the skill is maxed you want to have your fastest weapon in your<br/>
primary(for the primary hand bonus) and your best ratio weapon in in your<br/>
secondary.  Another thing to consider is procing weapons.  If you have a<br/>
weapon with an excellent proc, or a proc that you need to maximize the<br/>
chance of it going off, place that weapon in your primary.  For example when<br/>
I want to make sure I get a proc off my Orb of Tashan I will wield it in<br/>
primary, even though I have faster/better weapons I normally use in primary.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly you have to consider how the weapons look, we are bards after all.<br/>
Personally my main weapons are now a sainy&#39;s claw (EBW look) and the Skean<br/>
(from the rogue epic weapon quest).  I had a partisan but gave it away as it<br/>
was too ugly :)<br/>
<br/>
One thing on the Skean, I am deathly afraid it is going to get nerfed.  I<br/>
have had stun procs last as long as 8 secs!  Once I get my SSS I think I<br/>
will be pretty happy with my weapons for a long time.<br/>

&gt; Even by lvl 20 your chance of interuping a caster with a <br/>
&gt; single hit is real<br/>
&gt; small (non PVP).  MOnsters (rightly so, otherwise they would <br/>
&gt; be WAY too<br/>
&gt; easy) have insane channeling skill.<br/>
