&gt;the ability to bind anywhere because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a<br/>
&gt;corpse can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly 40% less<br/>
&gt;effective in melee combat because of their reduced OFF/DEF, and priests are<br/>
&gt;down 20%, and neither group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>
&gt;classes.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You gotta be kidding me.  I can&#39;t take a tough blue reliably, and after 20th<br/>
it has been the general consensus none of these classes can solo a tough<br/>
blue, and that&#39;s with all our equipment.  If a warrior over 20th level meets<br/>
a tough blue naked, he dies.  Not most of the time, nearly every time.  He<br/>
has zero chance of beating it without his primary equipment.  The caster can<br/>
at least root and run, if not root and nuke.  The warrior can just run and<br/>
either zone or die.  Fortunately bards can run fast and zone, or die.<br/>
<br/>
A caster without his equipment is far more effective than any melee class,<br/>
monks excepted, when he is naked.  A caster&#39;s main equipment is his spells<br/>
which he can regain immediately.  All other classes rely on thing they left<br/>
on their body to survive.  In truth it is far less dangerous for a caster to<br/>
run back to his body than for any of the melee classes.  <br/>
<br/>
Case in point.  My 5 level Druid was able to travel the length of Antonica,<br/>
through the gorge without incident.  He has camo.  An enchanter of 4th level<br/>
can do the same.  My 9th level Paladin was killed three times trying to<br/>
cross the karanas to Highhold.  He had no way to evade, no way to fight, and<br/>
he could not run fast enough.  Of all the melee classes, only the bard can<br/>
safely return to his corpse by outrunning the dangers.  Goodness imagine how<br/>
long it would take to Sneak from freeport to Guk, egads you&#39;d be running to<br/>
your corpse for over an hour.<br/>

The argument I make is that there is a compelling need for magic-users and<br/>
priests to be able to bind and bind anywhere.  That need is not present for<br/>
fighters and hybrids; rather, it would simply be a convenient ability to<br/>
have.     <br/>
<br/>
With all the work that Verant has done to balance the various classes, I do<br/>
not believe that one can reasonably expect them to make this major change to<br/>
the game without a compelling need.  I believe that it is also important to<br/>
consider the outcry Verant would get from the seven classes that can bind if<br/>
they let everyone bind.  Can&#39;t you already hear Namby Pamby the Necromancer<br/>
shouting across the zone about how badly Verant nerfed the casters, and how<br/>
they are owed some special &#39;hot death from above&#39; spell to offset the loss?<br/>
<br/>
My parting thought is this: sure I&#39;d love to have bind.  I&#39;d also like to be<br/>
the flying cuisinart of death, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;ve been endowed<br/>
by my creators with a wide variety of marvelous abilities (most of which<br/>
work), but bind is not one of them.  Being adaptable, I make do with what I<br/>
have, and frankly, I do pretty well.<br/>
