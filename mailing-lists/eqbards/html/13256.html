Good post.  Did you include this as part of your post to GZ for inclusion in<br/>
the next ArchMage Answers message?  I&#39;d like to see what he has to say about<br/>
some of the issues you raised.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The delineation of melee skills is compelling in my eyes as one reason<br/>
&gt; bards <br/>
&gt; &gt; are not hybrids.  As John said, we&#39;re &quot;not-a&quot;, or put another way we<br/>
&gt; share <br/>
&gt; &gt; characteristics of many classes without being classified as a member of<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; class.  We&#39;re kinda like rogues (silly skills), kinda like enchanters<br/>
&gt; (some <br/>
&gt; &gt; buffs, debuffs, and crowd control), kinda like shamans (some more buffs,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; minor healing).  Yet we&#39;re not-a-fighter, not-a-healer, not-a-caster.<br/>
&gt; We <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, I guess I was a bit too subtle in my cynicism.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the classes get good stuff, we&#39;re a &quot;not-a-&quot; class.  <br/>
&gt; Casters get bind, but we&#39;re not-a-caster.  Melee classes get<br/>
&gt; parry and riposte, but we&#39;re not-a-melee.  Hybrids got those<br/>
&gt; minor resist bonuses, but we&#39;re not-a-hybrid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, when classes get nerfed, we&#39;re a &quot;everything&quot; class.  <br/>
&gt; DoT damage gets nerfed, we&#39;re a kiting class.  Monster damage<br/>
&gt; gets increased to make life tougher on melee classes, we&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; melee class.  etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with being a &quot;not-a-&quot; class is that it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; definitive subset.  It changes based on the whim of what the<br/>
&gt; speaker wants it to be.  Verant uses it to make good sounding<br/>
&gt; excuses to deny us things they give other classes.  You want<br/>
&gt; bind?  But you&#39;re not a real casting class.  You want parry?  <br/>
&gt; But you&#39;re not a real melee class.  OTOH, if they&#39;d classified<br/>
&gt; us as hybrids for example, we would&#39;ve gotten parry and the<br/>
&gt; resist bonuses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; and 1 bard class (bard).  Our songs are NOT like the spells of any other<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; class in the way they are implemented (pulses?  what&#39;s a pulse?  why<br/>
&gt; would I <br/>
&gt; &gt; weave spells?);<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funny you should mention that.  My speculation is that this<br/>
&gt; weaving business was completely accidental.  I suspect the<br/>
&gt; game works on a 6 second heartbeat, so the shortest possible<br/>
&gt; spell/song duration is 6 seconds (this is a MUD-derived game<br/>
&gt; after all).  If you start/stop Accel and time its duration,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s always between 12 and 18 seconds.  That&#39;s 2 heartbeats +<br/>
&gt; [0 to 1.0 heartbeats depending on when you started the song in<br/>
&gt; the initial heartbeat].  So I suspect they made a song system<br/>
&gt; which had &quot;instant&quot; on/off effects, then found out that it let<br/>
&gt; you weave two songs, and decided it was a neat enough effect<br/>
&gt; that they increased some of the durations to make it easier to<br/>
&gt; do.  At its inception, I think bard songs were intended to<br/>
&gt; only last while the bard was singing them.  They just found it<br/>
&gt; impossible to code it that way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; others; and almost every one of our spells improves linearly with the<br/>
&gt; level <br/>
&gt; &gt; of the caster.  Plus of course there&#39;s the fact that we only get one<br/>
&gt; spell <br/>
&gt; &gt; per level (well, in theory anyways).  Ok, ok, they&#39;re songs, not spells<br/>
&gt; - we <br/>
&gt; &gt; differentiate our effects from all other casters&#39;, don&#39;t we?  = )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s another gripe that I have.  Since we only get one song<br/>
&gt; per level, I don&#39;t see why *all* our &quot;spells&quot; don&#39;t improve<br/>
&gt; with level.  Specifically, Chain&#39;s slowdown.  I mean here are<br/>
&gt; all these high level mobs which are designed to still be<br/>
&gt; challenging if an enchanter or shaman tosses a 100% or so<br/>
&gt; slowdown, and they won&#39;t improve our slowdown over the initial<br/>
&gt; 30%?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, I still enjoy playing the game.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; the bard class was implemented very well.  Mind you I would<br/>
&gt; never have decided this if I hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to play<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s implementation.  They didn&#39;t screw up, they tried<br/>
&gt; something and IMHO it wasn&#39;t very successful.  I think a good<br/>
&gt; way to implement a bard class in a real-time RPG will involve<br/>
&gt; different musical skills, phrasing, key, complexity, etc.,<br/>
&gt; each having a different magical effect.  The bard can then<br/>
&gt; pick and choose, effectively composing on the fly to make<br/>
&gt; different combinations of effects.  e.g. Minor key debuffs<br/>
&gt; opponent, major key buffs party; brass affects speed, drum<br/>
&gt; affects stats, and so on.  As your skill increases, so does<br/>
&gt; the complexity of your song and thus the power of the effect<br/>
&gt; (including being able to mix together things that are<br/>
&gt; typically mutually exclusive like major and minor key).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That and the stupid missed notes, which IMHO are pointless<br/>
&gt; with a class that doesn&#39;t have any mana to fizzle.  :)<br/>
