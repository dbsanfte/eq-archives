<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951208857">Melee can power level much faster than casters...  A caster will<br/>
always need mana to kill anything.  A melee with enough twinked armor<br/>
and a super weapon can kill a camain with a bubble of hp.  A twinked<br/>
melee with a lot of cash can pay someone to walk behind him and heal.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to superpower level is to get damage shields from high levels<br/>
on you.  24 damage each time you get hit... stuff dies fast.<br/>
<br/>
Also, ... usually you do not power level off a random spawn very well.<br/>
Caiman are random spawns... ickie.  Better to find an NPC with a very <br/>
quick spawn rate in your level range.  Stuff like the dwarves or elves<br/>
in OOT are favorites for necro&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The other day I was in Cazic deep in the sewers with a pretty good pickup<br/>
&gt; &gt;group.  I was the lowest at 31st level.  We only had five people in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;group so when a 34 necro shouted he wanted to join a party I told him we<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt;a spot.  When the necro joined the party, he told us that that he had<br/>
&gt; almost<br/>
&gt; &gt;no experience fighting in groups before.  He stated that he had soloed all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the way from 1st level to 34th level and only had 10 days played time.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt;stated that only now since he was at 34th did he find it necessary to join<br/>
&gt; &gt;groups to get good EXP.  I have heard that necros were the best at soloing<br/>
&gt; &gt;so I had trouble believing what he said.  I am 31st level with 29 days<br/>
&gt; &gt;played time.  A friend of mine is a 36 enchanter with 50 days played time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Someone in the party asked him if he had friends that helped him powerlevel<br/>
&gt; &gt;to 34th.  He said that he had done it all by himself and that he just knew<br/>
&gt; &gt;the right places to camp.  Does this sound credible that a necro can solo<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;34th in only 10 days played time?<br/>
