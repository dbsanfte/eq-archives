<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449950077"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was wondering how do you know all of this?  Is the song on the test server<br/>
&gt; or out on live server already?  This is a great song.  Ahh I love being a<br/>
&gt; bard. ;P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Someone wrote a program to parse the spell effect data file that<br/>
  Verant sends out with each new patch involving spell changes.<br/>
<br/>
  You can also find similar information on the EQSS Spells Database.<br/>

<br/>
  (If you log onto the test server your spell data file will be<br/>
   patched and you can see the new song/spell data)<br/>
<br/>
  This just gave me an idea too... We can take all the bard songs<br/>
  and after a new spell data file comes down to our computers then<br/>
  run some sort of program on the two files, old and new, and see<br/>
  what changed.  read:  what secretly changed.<br/>
