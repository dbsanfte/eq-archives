<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899724308">Mid-30s SK. His worst feature is his Harm Touch, 250-300 if he hits for<br/>
full. He is a tough fight even at 50 to solo. The item goes in the neck<br/>
slot. I was surprised to see some people use this item, everyone I know<br/>
that melees uses a gold black pearl necklace (if not a mithril torque<br/>
pal/rng/sk) and considers this &quot;cape&quot; to be a P.O.S.. ;P<br/>
