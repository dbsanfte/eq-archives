legend = - and | are walls and the platform in the middle of the room<br/>
       ~ is the water<br/>
       y are frogloks<br/>
       * is the warden<br/>
       O are troll prisioners in cells<br/>
the warden is sometimes not there, and will be replaced by a badass<br/>
froglok knight. he&#39;s been there for over 50% of the time for me, however.<br/>
notes on the warden: he can invis himself and _fight while invis_. you<br/>
NEED someone who can cast see invis if you are going to go down there. the<br/>
warden can also backstab for 150+dmg, so make sure that everyone is facing<br/>
him at all times.<br/>
the two frogloks on the platform will usually not come if you pull the 2<br/>
frogloks who are on ground level. the only time they have come down was<br/>
when the warden attacked at the same time, so be careful.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1 more question to add to this thread - how much do these go for?  I was<br/>
&gt;lucky enuf to acquire a pair of elf-hide gloves (thank you Lamont :)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on fennin ro, the gloves typically go for 100pp, and the belts probably a<br/>
bit more, since they seem a little more rare than the gloves. of course,<br/>
the economy on fennin ro is completely out of wack now.<br/>
