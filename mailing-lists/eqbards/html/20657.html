<div id="ygrps-yiv-201199185">Another issue to factor in is that the GeForce2 GTS has problems with Via<br/>
chipsey motherboards (in my experience).  This mean that most people using<br/>
Athlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>
GTS.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m in the process of return my GTS and will be purchasing a Voodoo5 5500<br/>
tonight.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes assuming this doesn&#39;t get Kabong&#39;ed<br/>
before then.<br/>
 <br/>
Other than compatibility, I will agree that the GTS is the better bang for<br/>
the buck.<br/>

Expect that this will get Kabong&#39;ed soon but:<br/>
<br/>
Price per pound the best card out there is the GeForce 2 GTS at around $290.<br/>
The only card that can touch it is the (as yet) unreleased Voodoo 5 6000.<br/>
It performs slightly better but costs $600.<br/>
<br/>
The Vodoo 5, 5500 isn&#39;t bad either at $290ish as well.  I personally prefer<br/>
the GeForce 2 because it&#39;s performance window is far higher and it offers a<br/>
lot of features that games are now starting to support.  As of right now<br/>
there aren&#39;t many but the game industry is starting to support more and more<br/>
features that NVidia is offering.<br/>
<br/>
If the system is JUST for EQ I would get the Voodoo card since EQ was<br/>
specifically designed for Voodoo technology back when it was built (circa<br/>
1997).  If you want to have the performance of the GeForce 2 on future<br/>
games, however, I&#39;d recommend the GeForce.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO:  GeForce is better bang for the buck.</div>
