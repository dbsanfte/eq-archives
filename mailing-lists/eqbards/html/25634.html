see 20 of the 29 new models... seems to be<br/>
running the same as before other than that. I<br/>
have a PIII 933mhz with a 60gb hard drive and am<br/>
using a Radeon 32mb video.<br/>

As far as lag is concerned - most of it stems<br/>
from your connection, I believe. I&#39;m only on a<br/>
26.4K dial up (blech!!) and the game doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
any worse now for lag than it did before. /shrug<br/>
