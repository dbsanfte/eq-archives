&gt;      Also, here&#39;s a question for the folks that are against any change in<br/>
&gt; binding:  If there were a change (whether it&#39;s bards able to bind, everyone<br/>
&gt; gets self-bind, anyone can be bound in any zone, etc), woudl you use it or<br/>
&gt; keep through the multiple zones to get to your corpse?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d probably keep myself bound in a city. But then I play with clerics,<br/>
so I haven&#39;t run back to my corpse in months. Corpse recovery is much<br/>
more an issue than mere running for your corpse at higher levels.<br/>
Getting a second group together to help fight to your corpse when<br/>
fighting the ghoul lord or the efreeti are much harder and take way<br/>
longer than merely running to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
With my druid I don&#39;t bind close to where I&#39;m fighting either. Usually<br/>
there&#39;s a druid gate within 2 or 3 zones of where I am, and I&#39;m used to<br/>
running that far as a bard anyway so it&#39;s no big deal. Currently my<br/>
druid is bound in quenos and fighting on Faydwer.<br/>
