&gt; how long does the song usually last?  i mean is it like druid harmony<br/>
&gt; where i cast it and it lasts a good 5 minutes per mob casted on? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Well, there have been reports of it lasting quite a while, but since<br/>
it doesn&#39;t take any mana, just time, I would always redo it before a battle.<br/>
Remember, if something goes wrong, you can always use Selo&#39;s to get out of<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
	Still not sure how great effect using an instrument has on it, but<br/>
just to be sure, I always use my lute.<br/>
