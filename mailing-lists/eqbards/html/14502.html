<div id="ygrps-yiv-699902950">My interpretation of these drawings has always been that the ligher colored<br/>
things were goblins from Sol A, while the red things were kobolds from Sol<br/>
B.  There are some inconsistencies with that, however, such as #14 that you<br/>
mention.  There are drawings in Sol A that you might want to factor into<br/>
this discussion as well.  At least one of those in Sol A (Gabbie&#39;s room I<br/>
think) has a map that seems to depict a coordinated attack on Lord Nagefen<br/>
by the Goblins.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at #8, I always thought that that picture depicted a failed<br/>
Nagefen attempt by the Golins.  You have Goblins charging Naggy with weapons<br/>
in hand, and a slew of dead Goblins around him.<br/>
<br/>
When I look at #13 from the King Room, I always thought that this depicted<br/>
the defeat of a former King at the hands of the Goblins, perhaps prior to<br/>
the Nagefen raid from #8?  The gold is a crown.<br/>

&gt;    #14, obviously 4 figures.  One large white one with three small<br/>
&gt;    white figures.  They appear to be worshipping the the big figure.<br/>
&gt;    As note that the big figure has a feathered headpiece (chief/king?)<br/>
&gt;    Each of the small figures has a unique color.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Could this be the Kobold king, with priest, champion, and noble<br/>
&gt;    worshipping him?  I mean the bigger white things do look like<br/>
&gt;    kobolds in a way.<br/>
