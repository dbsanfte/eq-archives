<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947273983">hm... i must admit that i had to search some time to find some answers,<br/>
especially the answer to the question regarding the bard npc in nektulous<br/>
for the mail-quest. didnt know his name, cause i actually never did the<br/>
quest there.<br/>
<br/>
twas very annoying to find out that all of my guildmates knew his name (they<br/>
are not bards), not because of the quest but because they killed him so many<br/>
times for xp... DOH! why are bard npcs such weenies?<br/>
<br/>
;)<br/>
