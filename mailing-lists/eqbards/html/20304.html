<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283097082">Thanks for all the replies folks (and keep &#39;em comin&#39; *grin* particularly<br/>
any 10-20 suggestions in Kunark) <br/>
<br/>
I forgot about how much fun reavers are and how effective the hermit is<br/>
(assuming you can get the camp) and how great NK is for teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
There are some Right of Passage places I was forgetting too, like wisps in<br/>
Erud&#39;s crossing at 12.<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, and the Kisch der Pavz....gotta give it a try once I get hit 19 and<br/>
get invis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
