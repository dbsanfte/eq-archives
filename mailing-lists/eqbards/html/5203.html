&gt; I went into Mistmoore for the first time last night.  While standing near<br/>
&gt; the zone border, I got messages similar to those you get in Unrest when<br/>
&gt; standing near the left wall.  For example in Unrest, you get the message &quot;a<br/>
&gt; festering hag casts a spell&quot; even though the hag is nowhere in sight but<br/>
&gt; instead underneath you in the basement.  I assume that means that the z-axis<br/>
&gt; bug also exists in Mistmoore and that I should be very careful when singing<br/>
&gt; are of effect songs like Denons Disruptive Discord.<br/>

dungeon are behind the wall next to the zone.  The area around<br/>
the gargoyle towards is also buggy (I&#39;ve died there twice due<br/>
to level 35-45 stuff casting on me through walls).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Any area effect songs.  The *only* place I&#39;ve found to be safe<br/>
for AE is the area to the left of the pond as you come down<br/>
the zone ramp, and wide open spaces like the middle of the<br/>
graveyard (do NOT use AE near the walls of the graveyard - I<br/>
saw an entire level 30 party wiped out in 5 seconds because of<br/>
this).<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I&#39;ve even had something cast at me through the walls<br/>
while I was in Lesser Faydark standing right next to the<br/>
Mistmoore zone.  I know this is supposed to be impossible, and<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if it hadn&#39;t happened to me.<br/>
Something with a Mistmoore-ish name behind the walls tagged me<br/>
with tashan and a DD.  I moved away from the zone and it<br/>
stopped casting at me.<br/>
