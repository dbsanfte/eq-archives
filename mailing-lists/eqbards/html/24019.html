<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520746489">Yeah, you had a bad roll there.  That scared me off Lament for quite awhile myself.  For that reason,<br/>
Lament isn&#39;t especially useful when trying to break an area that you can&#39;t handle if things go wrong,<br/>
unless you&#39;re willing to eat a death.  It is VERY useful trying to break an area that would be really<br/>
difficult and mana-exhaustive but doable.  Chef in Sebilis is an example.  There are five MOBs there.<br/>
With mez, a solid group can handle all five at once.  It isn&#39;t pretty, it takes a long time to recover<br/>
afterwards, and it doesn&#39;t break the room up very well for later respawns, but it can be done.  It&#39;s much<br/>
better if you can take the room apart in pieces, though - one, two or three at a time.  Which Lament lets<br/>
you do.  Basically, it lets you get smaller pulls a large part of the time, which helps a lot with<br/>
downtime and mana management.<br/>

&gt; if I&#39;m wrong, but we are *not* dungeon pullers, correct?  As in, pulling one<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I refuse to pull in Dalnir&#39;s now.  Last time I tried, the first lull on the<br/>
&gt; first mob was resisted...and it took the long way around to get me.  So many<br/>
&gt; casters, I was dead faster than I could warn the group.  With that less than<br/>
&gt; stellar record, even contemplating trying to lull 2 or 3 before pulling 1 is<br/>
&gt; less than appealing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m missing anything, but just wanted to check here, and make<br/>
&gt; sure.  :)<br/>
