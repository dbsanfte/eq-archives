<div id="ygrps-yiv-218038182">BTW - Joyjoy got a Melodic BP - on a raid that continued after I left<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;.  I&#39;m not sure how often Icewell is camped - I fought there once and<br/>
there was a warrior waiting to loot armor - I&#39;m sure if you can find a group<br/>
camping and they don&#39;t need the armor they&#39;ll let you loot it.<br/>
<br/>
Note that before a couple of patches ago - this wasn&#39;t bard usable..<br/>

Really cool, but sorry about your luck Slyde. I&#39;ve been in the Warlord all<br/>
of two times and the hand was camped seperately, but at peak hours with<br/>
60+ peeps in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hope to meet up on one of the XA raids. And thanks for the advice.<br/>
Prob need to get back to SS where I won the roll on my Sentry BP.<br/>
<br/>
As for Icewell, I&#39;m already KOS in SS and Kael. Think there&#39;s any<br/>
possibility of looting a Bard only No Drop in Icewell without killing and<br/>
taking the faction hit? I&#39;m no familiar with the zone (i.e. getting out)<br/>
or the drops.<br/>
<br/>
The only Bard I&#39;ve seen so far with the Melodic BP got it in a free loot<br/>
from a group in POG with no Bard. Talk about being in the right place at<br/>
the right time!<br/>
