Level is God, AC is King, Resist Stats are your best friends.<br/>

Sorry, imho, 47 is &quot;too low&quot; for Karnors, Seb and Chardok. I would say 50 is<br/>
too low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>
these places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>
you can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>
groups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>
do with class specific issues.  It&#39;s purely a level thing.<br/>

no kidding, like me yesterday was getting wailed by a cleric that i wasnt<br/>
high enough to be in karnors. Yet i was outdamaging the tanks (or<br/>
overtaunting).  To me that means that maybe i wasnt too low to be there,<br/>
after all i was crowd control as well and other then a bad streak of resists<br/>
compared to usual i was doing just fine...  But i dont like taking hits<br/>
either, we&#39;re not ment to be first line of defense, we&#39;re more like air<br/>
support 8)<br/>
