<div id="ygrps-yiv-808172237">Bind sight is a good thing to have - especially when you get to some higher<br/>
level places.  I really enjoy having it in all the Planes and on Dragon<br/>
runs.  Bards are usually in demand - ie not enough to go around - so you end<br/>
up sticking pretty close to the important mana casters in your group<br/>
(healers, nukers, etc.) So, the pullers get to go out and have the fun but<br/>
you can bind sight and watch through their eyes.  You can also bind to<br/>
wandering mobs and &quot;chain&quot; from one to another:  &quot;I can see the Maestro!<br/>
He&#39;s dual wielding! woo hoo!!! Opps he&#39;s got 4 golems as guards....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dont be afraid or forget to use it - I think you will enjoy it.<br/>

&gt; Anyway, pull carefully and you will rake in the exp.  Of course the zone<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; right near by in case you don&#39;t pull carefully... =8^)<br/>
