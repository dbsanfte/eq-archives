&gt; I have managed to PS three mobs (CT gators) at once (out of necessity not <br/>

&gt; one to the next once I had them all lined up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, once you&#39;ve Struck them a couple times, they will<br/>
usually chase after you and you can pull them away from your<br/>
party and what they&#39;re fighting.  Then you can let Strike<br/>
expire to further position them for easier targeting.  And <br/>
don&#39;t be afraid to turn or move to get a better targeting<br/>
angle.  You don&#39;t have to be facing your target to Strike<br/>
them, and the &quot;glaze&quot; or resist message still shows up on<br/>
your screen so you can elect not to retarget until you see<br/>
that Strike wasn&#39;t resisted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done three mobs as well, though you give up the safety<br/>
margin of being able to restrike if one of them resists.  <br/>
It&#39;s tremendously useful when a healer or caster joins late in<br/>
a fight.  Instead of the party having to break off from the<br/>
almost-dead mob to kill the healer/caster first, I just Strike<br/>
it over and over until the party finishes off the almost-dead<br/>
mob free from the aggravating nukes or heals.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the best warrior friend I had deleted his<br/>
character out of disgust at his ineffectiveness before Verant<br/>
beefed up the class.  They are a lot of fun to watch fight,<br/>
though I don&#39;t envy how much mana it must take the clerics to<br/>
heal them.  :-)<br/>
