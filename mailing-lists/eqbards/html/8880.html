&gt; Just wondering why you wouldn&#39;t use Lullaby over Pixie in this situation<br/>

&gt; level to sing Pixie yet so can&#39;t speak from experience.  It just seems that<br/>
&gt; it would be harder and more time consuming to target the three mobs in<br/>

(before it broke) has a much higher rate of keeping a mob<br/>
asleep for all 3 song rounds.<br/>
<br/>
With Lullaby I&#39;d guesstimate that on average it lasts 1-2 song<br/>
rounds.  I&#39;d only try weaving a second song with Lullaby in<br/>
certain situations (casters nuking the party = Lullaby/Rhythm,<br/>
everyone but me at low hp = Lullaby/Hymn).  Pixie Strike was<br/>
consistent enought that I&#39;d frequently weave two other songs<br/>
with Strike, or even keep three low-blue mobs asleep (same as<br/>
you can do with a L4 enchanter spell, so there&#39;s no balance<br/>
issue).<br/>
<br/>
In its current buggy state, the consequences of letting a<br/>
Strike exire are so dire (basically 15-30 seconds trying to<br/>
get it asleep again) that I won&#39;t risk weaving more than one<br/>
song with it, which as you point out makes the song rather<br/>
pointless in lieu of Lullaby.  As I said before, I&#39;m finding<br/>
that I take so much damage trying to get the first Strike to<br/>
stick that it&#39;s often more effective just to charm the mob,<br/>
or let it beat up on a real tank the entire fight.<br/>
