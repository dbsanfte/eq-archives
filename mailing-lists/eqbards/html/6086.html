&gt; So it seems that you don&#39;t get any chance to increase your skills (hand-to-<br/>
&gt; hand or any other offensive skills) when using the Lute.  As far as I could<br/>
&gt; tell, you don&#39;t increase in Dodge or Defense either...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your hand-to-hand skill will indeed go up while using an<br/>
instrument.  It may be one of those skills that doesn&#39;t go up<br/>
except upon success.  I spent a half hour running around with<br/>
a level 1 monk wondering why he was rarely hitting for more<br/>
than 1 point of damage when I finally got the &quot;You have become<br/>
better and hand to hand (1)&quot; message, after which it went up<br/>
pretty quickly.  (Doh - remember to train at least one point<br/>
in each weapon skill.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Your songs continue to improve as you level, so what<br/>
might not have been a viable strategy at level 10 can be a<br/>
very effective strategy at level 20.  That&#39;s another element<br/>
of complexity that I really love about the bard.<br/>
