<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434701546">gatorsmash maul sucks, as did 98% of all pre kunark 2h blunts.<br/>
<br/>
The gatorsmash is dam 30, delay 70, which is not even better than a .5<br/>
ratio. This is pathetic compared to the 2h slashes that were pre kunark<br/>
(mith 2 hander is 21 / 40 + haste making it more like 21 / 30, there are<br/>
several 35 / 50 weapons etc.) Pre kunark 1h blunts followed the same sort of<br/>
disadvantage where the 1h slash were FAR superior in ratio to the 1h blunts.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, pre kunark 2h weapons did not have the additional damage bonus<br/>
which further skewed the bias to fast 1 hand weapons. Bards had pick of the<br/>
litter of both 1h slash and 1h blunt and could far outdamage druids or<br/>
shamen of similar melee ability.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point:<br/>
A bard dual wielding yaks will put a shaman using a gatorsmash to shame.<br/>
<br/>
Pre kunark, bard defense skills were superior to shamen, clerics and druids<br/>
so we had the advantage there also, albeit slight a slight one.<br/>
<br/>
All of that isn&#39;t to say that we were good at melee, but if you put 2 decent<br/>
weapons into the hands of a bard, they can dish out some damage. If you put<br/>
a decent weapons into the hands of a druid, it&#39;s still useless.<br/>
<br/>
Now a days, with the release of kunark, melee between druids, shamen,<br/>
clerics and bards has evened out a bit because the weapon selection in the<br/>
blunt arena is on par with the selection of slashers and piercers. This<br/>
means that now, bards only have the slight advantage in melee skills that we<br/>
have to put us ahead of one of the healing classes in a straight melee<br/>
fight. Thus, relatively, we have lost melee skill when compared with a<br/>
druid, cleric or shaman.<br/>

Actually our melee &quot;Skills&quot; pre-kunark were &quot;worse&quot; than they are now.<br/>
After all we now get parry and riposte (admittedly at godawful high levels).<br/>
So this statement isn&#39;t entirely true.  Our Melee &quot;Skills&quot; have never been<br/>
much better than pure casters.  And there were always some freakin brutal<br/>
weapons available to casters that were 2h blunt (Gatorsmash maul comes to<br/>
mind for shaman).  The weapon field was a TAD skewed in our favor but the<br/>
bottom line was that our melee ability isn&#39;t much better than that of a<br/>
cleric, shaman or druid.  All four of them get 4 offense/defense points per<br/>
level (to our 5) have only slightly lower dodge caps (75 or 80) and can wear<br/>
equivalent armor (Cleric armor is actully just as good, if not better).<br/>
<br/>
So, sure we were &quot;Better&quot; at melee.  But we were FAR from &quot;Good&quot; at melee.<br/>
We have always been a VERY poor substitute for any of the &quot;melee&quot; classes in<br/>
the game.  Early in final, as Kit has said, a lot of bards who hadn&#39;t been<br/>
beyond level 20 yet were adamant that bards were only slightly worse at<br/>
melee than other hybrids.  Which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are the &quot;Caster&quot; hybrid.  The others are &quot;Melee&quot; hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, Kit is right.  A lot more bards understand themselves better these<br/>
days ;)  It&#39;s actually nice to think back to some of the rather humorous<br/>
assumptions that newbie bards used to start with ;)  Now days most newbie<br/>
bards (the good ones anyway) get educated by the best (those on this list)<br/>
early on and learn how to be very effective bards indeed.  I would say that<br/>
overall the quality of bards has improved because of the bards on this list<br/>
and, to a slightly lesser extent, the bards on the Concert Hall.  Rokken&#39;s<br/>
site, Caster&#39;s Realm and Concert Hall have all become excellent resources<br/>
for bards.  When I started barding we didn&#39;t have anything but word of mouth<br/>
(usually in the chat area when servers were down).<br/>
