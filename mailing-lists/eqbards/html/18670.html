<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050619775">Of course the &quot;feature&quot; is nothing more of an annoyance to us non-cheaters<br/>
who simply got to the character selection screen and forgot to un-mute the<br/>
sound!  Ahhhh damnit!  I did it again!  Esc...Esc...Esc...Esc...<br/>

&gt;The key strokes will now disable the EQ connection...<br/>
&gt;I used it to research the web, but the strokes WERE....<br/>
&gt;Ctrl+Alt+Del ...  Choose &#39;Cancel&#39;  (You&#39;re in the desktop now)<br/>
&gt;Do whatever you need to do...<br/>
&gt;Click on the EQ tas in the task bar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you did this, your desktop mouse cursor would remain visable, but you<br/>
&gt;were unable to move it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Someone once posted a sequence of key strokes that would successfully<br/>
&gt;&gt; let<br/>
&gt;&gt; you hotkey out of EQ and back in.  I can&#39;t find the post now and was<br/>
&gt;&gt; wondering if anyone here knows how to do it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
