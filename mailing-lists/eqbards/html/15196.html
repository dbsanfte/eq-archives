<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-80494441">I love this place, went here on saturday with 2 guild mates (43 monk, 36<br/>
druid and me, 38 bard). In an hour we got a Crystalline blade, Zaharns<br/>
Coronet and I kill the scryer and got an Ice crystal staff.<br/>
<br/>
The incident that happened was when we was happily controlling the spawn in<br/>
the king room when two low 30&#39;s people came along, decided to run down<br/>
through the doors and trained 2 Giants (we had killed the diplomat). After<br/>
killing both these people they came for me. I tried to make a runner but<br/>
only got to the flag room.<br/>
<br/>
I was so angry, these 2 idiots came along and ruined my fun, luckily a<br/>
level 48 cleric was in Everfrost and agreed to res me for free (I still<br/>
gave him a serp bracer for his kindness). I was bound in Freeport so didn&#39;t<br/>
fancy running back to Perma from there.<br/>
<br/>
This also shows that bard song taunts have not been reduced, god knows how<br/>
but we was near the top of the king room and the giants killed the 2 guys<br/>
down near the King spawn and the giants still came for me.<br/>
<br/>
Enough of my rant, I got the exp back and am now level 39. Also won roll on<br/>
Mithril Breastplate last night, on testing it I notice that when worn<br/>
compared to the Lambent BP it gives 8 less hp&#39;s and 2 less ac points than<br/>
Lambent but the +15 Agi is nice. I really like the look of the mithril<br/>
whilst in dark elf form too.<br/>
