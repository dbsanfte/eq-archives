<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444939551">Actually our melee &quot;Skills&quot; pre-kunark were &quot;worse&quot; than they are now.<br/>
After all we now get parry and riposte (admittedly at godawful high levels).<br/>
So this statement isn&#39;t entirely true.  Our Melee &quot;Skills&quot; have never been<br/>
much better than pure casters.  And there were always some freakin brutal<br/>
weapons available to casters that were 2h blunt (Gatorsmash maul comes to<br/>
mind for shaman).  The weapon field was a TAD skewed in our favor but the<br/>
bottom line was that our melee ability isn&#39;t much better than that of a<br/>
cleric, shaman or druid.  All four of them get 4 offense/defense points per<br/>
level (to our 5) have only slightly lower dodge caps (75 or 80) and can wear<br/>
equivalent armor (Cleric armor is actully just as good, if not better).<br/>
<br/>
So, sure we were &quot;Better&quot; at melee.  But we were FAR from &quot;Good&quot; at melee.<br/>
We have always been a VERY poor substitute for any of the &quot;melee&quot; classes in<br/>
the game.  Early in final, as Kit has said, a lot of bards who hadn&#39;t been<br/>
beyond level 20 yet were adamant that bards were only slightly worse at<br/>
melee than other hybrids.  Which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are the &quot;Caster&quot; hybrid.  The others are &quot;Melee&quot; hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, Kit is right.  A lot more bards understand themselves better these<br/>
days ;)  It&#39;s actually nice to think back to some of the rather humorous<br/>
assumptions that newbie bards used to start with ;)  Now days most newbie<br/>
bards (the good ones anyway) get educated by the best (those on this list)<br/>
early on and learn how to be very effective bards indeed.  I would say that<br/>
overall the quality of bards has improved because of the bards on this list<br/>
and, to a slightly lesser extent, the bards on the Concert Hall.  Rokken&#39;s<br/>
site, Caster&#39;s Realm and Concert Hall have all become excellent resources<br/>
for bards.  When I started barding we didn&#39;t have anything but word of mouth<br/>
(usually in the chat area when servers were down).<br/>
