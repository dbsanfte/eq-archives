<div id="ygrps-yiv-819184595">Hmmm bet I can guess what the new quests are like.  Here&#39;s a sample:<br/>
<br/>
Aloro: Hail, Wethyl Stringplucker!<br/>
Wethyl: Hail, Aloro.  Can you help me?  I have need of some [special picks].<br/>
Aloro: What special picks?<br/>
Wethyl: In order to perform my latest composition I need only the finest <br/>
quality picks.  [Sylia Windlehands] in Kelethin stole my last one.<br/>
Aloro: &lt;looking nervously around&gt; You mean the bard guildmistress there?  <br/>
The one who trained me in the fundamentals of music?<br/>
Wethyl:<br/>
Aloro: What do you want from Sylia Windlehands?<br/>
Wethyl: Slay her and bring me the pick she carries.  I will make it well <br/>
worth your time.<br/>
Aloro: Listen, Wethyl, thanks and all, but 1) Sylia is a friend of mine, and <br/>
2) I already have a mandolin.  Push off, you sick monkey!<br/>
<br/>
OK, ok, I am a trifle cynical, but we&#39;ll see. = P<br/>
