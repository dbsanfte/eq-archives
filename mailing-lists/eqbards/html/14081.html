&gt; &gt; the anchor perhaps?) the ship would get a big speed boost.  But you <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; crash while zoning.  So now stop making fun of me or will have to <br/>
&gt;keel-haul<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lot of you :p<br/>

&gt;   Hey Rokenn, if this gets old let me know.  I&#39;m still having fun with<br/>
&gt;   it.  Unless other people are sick of the analogy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Admiral Rokenn, and &#39;Rear&#39; Admiral Shada it seems now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic, 1/8th a bub my ass. hehe. go take that breath like a bard ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh, your just jealous thats all :)  I do have to say Vox is a lot harder <br/>
now.  It seems that Bash/Slam no longer will interrupt her complete heal <br/>
spell, ouch!  I am thinking I will try to talk my guild into forming a mana <br/>
drain team to see if that helps reduce the CH&#39;s she gets off.<br/>
<br/>
It is not too late for you to join Rokenn&#39;s Navy.  Just get your resistance <br/>
up over 220 and you can join today, haha.<br/>
