&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve seen, the dev teams idea of extensive testing is to look at<br/>
&gt; the code and say &quot;oh yeah, that should work&quot;.  They can&#39;t even tell when a<br/>
&gt; quest is broken from day one they implement it so they obviously don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; unit test their code by running it once.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can say that again. I&#39;m sure a few of us remember when they first<br/>
released our 30, 38 and 46 songs and they didn&#39;t work except when you<br/>
targetted yourself. Nice QA there guys. Someone couldn&#39;t even find the 2<br/>
minutes needed to test the songs against a bat in the newbie zone.<br/>
<br/>
Dispite Brad&#39;s claims to the contrary I think they are running an<br/>
extremely small crew of programmers and little to no testers (they<br/>
probably make the GM&#39;s responsible for QA as well as their regular jobs<br/>
of phone support for all Verant&#39;s games and their GM duties.<br/>
