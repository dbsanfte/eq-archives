<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-986696062">Specific instances are not coming to mind at the moment, but I can say I<br/>
have actually had more positive (or at least neutral) group experiences<br/>
with mages than I have negative.   Then again, I have so seldom grouped<br/>
with mages in the last year+ that maybe I just got lucky.<br/>
<br/>
Only reoccuring beef I have had with them are ones who do not understand<br/>
that Earth pets interfere with snaring when in critical positions.<br/>
<br/>
/g Train passing, make sure that thing is snared<br/>
Jabobn begins to cast a spell<br/>
/g Ack, no, not the pet!<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
/gu Hey, could someone TP me back to Kunark?  No res<br/>
XXX tells the guild &#39;Geez, woman, collar that pet! I am getting sick of<br/>
TPing your butt every ten minutes ;P&#39;<br/>
ZZZ tells the guild &#39;Keep group with that mage, Kar...you might be low<br/>
enough to group with me again soon :)&#39;<br/>
