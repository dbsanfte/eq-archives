<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022703675">Heh - I guess it&#39;s time to &quot;agree to disagree.&quot; (Fwiw: I have an entirely<br/>
different interpretation of the Dirkson quote.  I read it as so-called<br/>
&quot;small things&quot; - is a billion dollars ever small? - do add up.  The irony of<br/>
the quote being that some folks consider &quot;a billion here & a billion there&quot;<br/>
fairly trivial.)  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the fact that there are so many choices.  With bards your choices<br/>
change over time as you get more songs to choose from.  <br/>
<br/>
Another situation where damage shields and every increment that can get<br/>
added to them becomes important is on the bigger mobs that are hitting alot<br/>
of folks at very fast rates.  Damage shieds can do a considerable amount of<br/>
damage - especially when the mob is hitting very fast on many people. Sort<br/>
of the converse of many mobs hitting a few people - one very fast mob<br/>
hitting a bunch of people.  We (our guild) use them.  When we fight big<br/>
mobs, one of the very first concerns is getting the damage shields on the<br/>
mobs - off as fast as we can.  As much for preventing players from going LD<br/>
as mitigating the damage everyone will take attacking a mob with a DS.  The<br/>
other thing that gets done as soon as possible is MR debuffing the mob.<br/>
Tash, Malo, etc. Then we slow the mob if at all possible: tugurs (sp?),<br/>
shiftless deeds, etc. And of course snare.<br/>
<br/>
So, when I see a bard following that line of thinking: MR debuff, slow<br/>
attack, slow movement, damage shield; it does not seem so wrong.  I grant<br/>
you that there are other choices - and I mentioned that we would need to<br/>
know what level the bard is/was to know what choices he did have.  I just<br/>
bristle at blanket statements like &quot;...it&#39;s always this...&quot; or &quot;... that&#39;s<br/>
never right..&quot;.<br/>

Uh, Dirkson&#39;s point was that adding more money wasn&#39;t necessarily a good<br/>
idea just because the amount you were adding was seemingly insignificant.</div>
