<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875419013"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 22 -- Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody.  As far as I can tell, this<br/>
&gt;       doesn&#39;t do squat.  Never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It removes any malicious spells on you or your group members.<br/>
It actually is useful in an area with lots of necros or shamans.<br/>
This is confirmed, 1st hand information and not off a website =)<br/>
Especially if those shamans are casting drowsy-line spell one<br/>
after one after one, if the song cancels those too =) (not sure)<br/>
Also, have not tried, but I bet you 100:1 ratio that it will remove<br/>
root.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;       fought anything with disease, it was the undead gnolls in Lake<br/>
&gt;       Rathe (at the S Karana zone border), and we just had our druid<br/>
&gt;       cure us after the fight.  No biggie.  I don&#39;t think anyone in<br/>
&gt;       the party would have even cared for extra disease resistance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Wonder if some spesific song would have been a nice fast<br/>
way to get rid of all those (only) annoying bad spells laid on<br/>
you and your group ;)<br/>
