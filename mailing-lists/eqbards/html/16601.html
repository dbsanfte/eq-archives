<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-613810559">This would fall under the category of a crowd control song and function very<br/>
similar to Lullaby.  Everyone knows all the problems associated with<br/>
Lullaby.  The only difference between this song and Lullaby is that the mobs<br/>
would follow you around while with Lullaby they just stand there (if you get<br/>
it to stick).  Now if this song made it where the mobs didn&#39;t attack the<br/>
bard when he stopped playing it then it has some merit.<br/>
<br/>
Along similar lines:  <br/>
<br/>
The ultimate crowd control song would be one that is a combination of<br/>
Lullaby, the Charismatic carillon, with a mem blur component added in just<br/>
for shits and grins.  This song would be the ultimate train derailer.  Group<br/>
gets in trouble, bards fires up this song, mobs stop attacking, mem blur<br/>
kicks in to erase hate list, carillon kicks in to make the bard non-KOS to<br/>
the mobs (would require an improved version of Carillon).  While the song is<br/>
playing, the rest of the party can move to a safe location.  Bard quits<br/>
playing and safely walks away.  Effects of song go away if mob gets attacked<br/>
by anyone, party or non-party.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea for a high level song is a straight up improved version of<br/>
Carillon that makes the bard non-KOS to everything in the zone (raises you<br/>
at a minimum to Indifferent against everything except undead).  This would<br/>
mean that bards could pretty much go anywhere in the game with relative<br/>
safety.  All they would have to do is tweak the code for Carillon and this<br/>
song would be ready for release.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now *this* is an original, highly useful song idea that I think the list<br/>
should give a lot of attention to...I can see how it might be considered<br/>
too powerful, but I think it is an idea worth working with, at the very<br/>
least.  Any ideas?<br/>
