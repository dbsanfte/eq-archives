<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591581927">Noon on a Friday?  What college student is organizing this shindig anyhow?<br/>
I don&#39;t want to sound *too* much like the decrepid cog in the workforce that<br/>
I am, but some of us might have to work and stuff.<br/>

&gt; OK, some details on the running of of gnomes...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make a first-level gnome on E&#39;ci.  Give him/her a name beginning with Gn,<br/>
&gt; preferably followed by your bard&#39;s name (e.g. Gnkitasi, Gnaloro).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meet at noon PST this Friday (11/26/99) in Ak&#39;Anon.  We have offers of<br/>
&gt; teleports, and will try to get everyone rounded up and bound in<br/>
&gt; Freeport for<br/>
&gt; the run.  I understand that some people can&#39;t be there then, but<br/>
&gt; we all have<br/>
&gt; scheduling problems, and some people can&#39;t make it at other times.  Once<br/>
&gt; gathered in Freeport, we will run to lavastorm and hurl ourselves<br/>
&gt; into the<br/>
&gt; lava pits en masse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far about a dozen people have responded...  I&#39;d really like to<br/>
&gt; see this<br/>
&gt; bring the EQ bardic community together, as much as possible.  I&#39;ve posted<br/>
&gt; this information on the bard boards I frequent, and will send it into the<br/>
&gt; spoiler sites soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope to see you all there!<br/>
