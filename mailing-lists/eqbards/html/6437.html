<br/>
I do remember seeing the message saying the song effect was working.  Then I<br/>
looked to see if it made any difference (how can you tell if attack speed is<br/>
decreased - let alone decreased ac?)  So I looked at the scroll and tried to<br/>
see if the monster was getting hits on our party and watched the health bars<br/>
of the party.  I do believe that the song worked. <br/>
<br/>
The party could kill this monster without the song - so that is not the<br/>
test.  Without song party kills monster but suffers some damage.  With song<br/>
party kills monster but suffers less damage.<br/>

		For one - they resisted my chain but not my binds. Two, when<br/>
under the<br/>
		effect of song - they did not fight back as the party beat<br/>
them down<br/>
		&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		I do not see any different in bind at all.  Do u need to<br/>
play an instrument<br/>
		for it to work?  I see chain as working a little bit better<br/>
being that it<br/>
		cannot run away.<br/>
