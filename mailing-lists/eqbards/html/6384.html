25, starting a couple weeks after you and I got the song<br/>
(which is why there was some disagreement here about exactly<br/>
when the damage goes up to 6 points).<br/>

As for bards doing nothing but bellowing or druids (and it<br/>
seems mages) tanking, I think it comes from too much solo play<br/>
and not enough group play.  When soloing, these tactics often<br/>
make sense.  It all changes when you group though.  For bards,<br/>
an attack or AC buff that makes little difference when applied<br/>
to just one person can make a big difference when applied to 5<br/>
people.  Druids are used to tanking out of necessity, and<br/>
mages to keep their pets alive.  But they may not yet<br/>
understand the tactical advantage of letting someone with<br/>
better AC and defensive skills tank.  I&#39;ve found that most<br/>
people appreciate when you explain this to them, and several<br/>
are even thankful that you took the time to help them better<br/>
understand it.  They may not change their tactics immediately,<br/>
but they do try.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, saying someone&#39;s tactics are wrong is a great way to<br/>
polarize them to oppose anything you say. Explaining how<br/>
things work in a neutral manner, then suggesting how they<br/>
might improve their tactics against this explanation often<br/>
gets them to &quot;see the light&quot; without the negative reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the one time I did do nothing but Bellow was when chasing<br/>
down runners.  Due to lag I couldn&#39;t reliably stay within<br/>
melee range so Anthem or Warson didn&#39;t help, and the mob was<br/>
not attacking me so Rhythms or Hymn was pointless, but Bellow<br/>
was almost always guaranteed to damage the target.  Then I<br/>
reached 23 and got Chain and haven&#39;t looked back...<br/>
