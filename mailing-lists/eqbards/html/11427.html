<div id="ygrps-yiv-613052951">I&#39;ve recovered 6 or 7 corpses from the lava in Sol A (so far none of them<br/>
mine :-)).  In each case, I simply locate with my song, get a levitation and<br/>
then just bounce out over the lava and back to safety before I have the<br/>
chance to float down.  In every case, I&#39;ve been able to /corpse the body<br/>
back (through the Z axis bug?) without any problems...  Even the ones where<br/>
people panic and tried to swim for it (my wife tried to climb the<br/>
waterfall).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I died in the lava - fell off the ramp running to zone on first visit to<br/>
&gt; &gt; that place.  My wiz fiend levi&#39;d over and dragged it out - I<br/>
&gt; was rezzed and<br/>
&gt; &gt; looted it at the zone - but boy was I nervous while sitting in Rivervale<br/>
&gt; &gt; waiting for them to get it. She musta blindly clicked until she got it<br/>
&gt; &gt; targeted.  I consented and she dragged.  She might have pulled<br/>
&gt; it to a place<br/>
&gt; &gt; where Z-axis effect can pull it up to the top, zoned out,  then<br/>
&gt; /corpsed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; up to the top. (We /corpsed one from the bottom of HH canyon<br/>
&gt; straight up to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the top ledge one time.)<br/>

&gt; You can drag stuff out of lava anywhere else in Sol A (you may<br/>
&gt; have to get creative with your levitate, but you can do it).<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just the section past that lavafall where you can&#39;t pull<br/>
&gt; it out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava<br/>
&gt; pool into Sol-b?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would<br/>
&gt; end up in Lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone<br/>
&gt; out of sol-b<br/>
&gt; &gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That particular zone point goes from lava to lava.  I spent<br/>
&gt; the better part of an hour (my first hour ever in Sol B mind<br/>
&gt; you) finding a friend&#39;s corpse after he fell in in Sol A,<br/>
&gt; zoned through to Sol B, and died.  We had no idea where in<br/>
&gt; that lava zone came out in Sol B, and I had to rely on the<br/>
&gt; song to figure out where his corpse was.  (I was not attacked<br/>
&gt; the entire time, and figured Sol B wasn&#39;t so bad so decided to<br/>
&gt; play there a bit, and problem died to a sonic bat train. :-)<br/>
