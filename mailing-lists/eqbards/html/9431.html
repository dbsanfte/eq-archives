<div id="ygrps-yiv-595205703">I think that&#39;s the point.  The stats on the armor are INCREDIBLE!<br/>
Definately gotta be high level material.  The cash issue will be outta the<br/>
way, easily, by level 35 for me.  (28 now).  Vox... well, did I mention high<br/>
level material?  : )<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I don&#39;t seem to be noticing any effect off Pixie Strike.... Message<br/>
says something to the effect of &quot;Eyes glaze over&quot; then immediately after &quot;An<br/>
Ogre Shaman hits you for 48 pts of damage&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this not working or is that the feeble attempt of stun I get at level 28?<br/>

&gt; &gt;The Dragonscale armor sounded sweet as well - I saw that it was quest<br/>
&gt; &gt;obtained and my jaw nearly dropped from my skull.  Unfortunately, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;requires an item that I have a snowballs chance in hell of getting and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have no idea what the Vial of Swirling Mist is, or where it comes from?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I remember correctly, the Vial of Swirling Smoke is the famous Gate<br/>
&gt; Potion, sold in Kelethin for the reasonable and economically feasible<br/>
price<br/>
&gt; of 1000pp, give or take a hundred. = )  I believe it is also sold<br/>
elsewhere<br/>
&gt; (East Freeport?) but I do recall seeing it in Kelethin.  Sooo to get this<br/>
&gt; armor all you need is roughly 2000pp... oh, and you have to kill Nagafen.<br/>
