 </span></blockquote>Another issue to factor in is that the GeForce2 GTS has problems with Via<br/>
chipsey motherboards (in my experience).  This mean that most people using<br/>
Athlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>
GTS.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds about right - Athlons and Via are not good bedfellows.  I&#39;ve got a<br/>
GeForce DDR on a P3V4X mobo (Via Apollo Pro) with a P3-800 and it runs<br/>
without problems.  There&#39;s not much to choose from a GeForce DDR and a<br/>
GeForce2 GTS at lower resolutions (anthing less than 1024x768).  I also<br/>
tried a GTS on the same motherboard for a week and it ran without problems.<br/>

If your friend is on a budget, he might want to consider a GeForce DDR (such<br/>
as the Creative Labs Annihilator Pro) which you can pick up for half the<br/>
price of a GeForce2.</div>
