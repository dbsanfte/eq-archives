<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053245870">My base is close to yours - when I created I thought the same thing and<br/>
dumped into agi, dex and cha.  I am ok with agi and dex but didn&#39;t know the<br/>
cha is so easily boosted and that str would also impact how hard your hit<br/>
for and how much weight you can carry - rtf-web page I guess.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I was twinked with a full set of bronze one night.  I can&#39;t even wear<br/>
all the stuff I have and not be encumbered with 20 milk and muffins.  So, I<br/>
choose to wear the visible pieces and get str boosters where ever I can.<br/>
Now I am pretty good - str wise with no buffs or songs going.  I am still in<br/>
situations where I have to melee and am not always assured that I can be<br/>
buffed - so I want to be sure that I am not encumbered in the melee.<br/>
Encumberment really penalizes your agi and dex (I think).  I have dex rings<br/>
and str rings and carry both.  Depending on what I need - or think I need I<br/>
will switch them and go from str to dex - but I think it&#39;s a marginal<br/>
effect.  if I am light weight - I go for more dex to hit better. if I get<br/>
heavy, I go for str to stay unencumbered.<br/>
<br/>
Now if things change and I can find a regular group that lets me stand off<br/>
and play instruments, I&#39;d add more pieces and up my AC.  I do think that AC<br/>
is AC and the type of armor does not matter - beyond whatever special things<br/>
it gives you (str, agi, dex, sv poison, magic whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
Bronze is heavy and you may want to try for a mix.  Some blackened iron<br/>
should start hitting the market soon and maybe you can mix that in or work<br/>
for an all black look.<br/>
<br/>
So to your question - AC is AC but weight per AC varies greatly.  Analyze<br/>
weight to AC ratios and choose accordingly.  Look at each piece and you will<br/>
see some are lots more efficient than others. More AC per weight unit.  Agi<br/>
is yor ability to dodge blows and Dex is your ablilty to hit your opponent.<br/>
Encumberment will degrade your AGI and you DEX - avoid the melee when<br/>
encumbered.<br/>
