<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602219550">LOL, actually I have a good connection just a bad server.  E&#39;ci is so<br/>
desperately in need of splitting we have been down at some point almost<br/>
every night for the last week.  Several of the servers that have been split<br/>
had less people on most of the time but since we don&#39;t have any uber-guilds<br/>
to uber-whine our regular whining falls on deaf ears apparently.  I expect<br/>
we will top 3000 at some point this weekend since we are hitting 2800+ on<br/>
weeknights now.<br/>

&gt; that&#39;s what I thought.  The problem I encountered with mine was that one<br/>
lag<br/>
&gt; spike or disappearing mob and you died, period.  They just don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; hp&#39;s to survive getting caught by one of the charmee&#39;s I found.  Our<br/>
regular<br/>
&gt; enchanter in the Armigers had even less luck charming than I did, probably<br/>
&gt; due to not having to deal with it on a 12 second basis before ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Maybe if you have a particularly bad connection. Otherwise, with<br/>
the color line of stuns and mez an enchenter shouldn&#39;t have too much<br/>
trouble re-charming.<br/>
