<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678533859">would warsong or VoV be better in a solo situation?  i ask because last<br/>
night i finally won my first duel against a melee class (without kiting or<br/>
running, i stand up to them!).  out of 4 duels, i won 2.  he&#39;s a level 50<br/>
rogue in my guild, full hateplane armor, crystalline spear, vexthorne, bone<br/>
razor, cloak of flames, badass rogue by all accounts.  obviously not a huge<br/>
amount of hit points, but a massive damage dealer.  and i have full hate<br/>
armor and weps, for comparison.  anyway, i never thought to play warsong.  i<br/>
played VoV instead.  being level 50 he resisted a lot of songs i tried to<br/>
hit him with, so i stuck to buffing myself.  when cessation or chains did<br/>
hit him tho, he was noticeably slower, but even with only 45 MR, just being<br/>
level 50 he resisted too much to help.  first tried instrument only attack,<br/>
but like i said he resisted too much.  second i played VoV/Niv&#39;s and tried<br/>
to slow him, again he resisted but i won with 36hp left.  third time he got<br/>
some lucky backstabs in, and he also got too close when i dirged and i hit<br/>
us both.  4th time was the best, i played VoV/Niv&#39;s and with psalm of<br/>
cooling he tore himself up on the dmg shield.  won with 246 hp left.  also,<br/>
i have joined the AC bandwagon.  still have my 4 primary stats over 100 (str<br/>
130, dex 117, agi 110, cha 113) and i hit 801 AC and 1314 hp unbuffed.  what<br/>
can i say i&#39;m a tank in a bard&#39;s body.<br/>

&gt; - Yes, you can use Chain and Warsong to get an equivalent to a<br/>
&gt; 56% haste (1.3*1.2) relative to the mob.<br/>
