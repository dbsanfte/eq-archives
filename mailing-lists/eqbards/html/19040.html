<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040488378">Well, they did patch saying that Dalnir mobs were casting spells WELL above thier ability. Hopefully that<br/>
was fixed.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hehe.  And I got one long before I went to Dalnir.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HOWEVER:<br/>
&gt; The boss mob of the dungeon drops the Necklace of Superiority or whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5AC, +5 to all stats.  +10 to all resists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be warned:  His placeholder has a 1000dmg AOE Attack.  So does he and he has<br/>
&gt; 2x the hp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The placeholder (Kly Overseer) dropped a full group of 6 40+ members<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (oh, did I mention he was blue to level 39 ?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; We&#39;re starting to explore Dalnir now in force.  I&#39;m told there&#39;s bard<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; there but I think it&#39;s just a ploy to get me to log in my bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Without huge spoilers, anything a bard can look forward to in here?<br/>
&gt; Cleric?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course I&#39;ll continue going even if there&#39;s just xp and good times<br/>
&gt; alone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s just nice to have a goal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (admit it, lower guk was a lot more exciting to explore when you saw what<br/>
&gt; &gt; people were hauling out of there :P)<br/>
