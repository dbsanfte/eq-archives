&gt;It only has one anyhow, but even having 1 Greater Heal handy for emergencies<br/>
&gt;is a nice boon for 2pp, especially since Light Heal potions cost 11pp and<br/>
&gt;are Lore.  With my Squad Ring (Healing 1chg, rechargeable), Prayer Beads<br/>
&gt;(Healing 2chgs), and new Ring (Greater Healing 1chg) I have quite an arsenal<br/>
&gt;of emergency healing on hand.  Thankfully the Ring and Prayer Beads are no<br/>
&gt;No Drop so I can move them to another character if necessary.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Had a really weird thing happen the other night.  I was running thru Qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt;looking for tailoring supplies and checking all the vendors.  I found a HQ<br/>
&gt; &gt;bear pelt which made me happy, but the merchant also had Mistmoore Drums<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;a Blessed Ring of Nife.  The Drums were way out of my price range, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;couldn&#39;t imagine why anyone would sell them to a merchant even if they were<br/>
&gt; &gt;quitting their bard.  The Ring of Nife is also very useful and was only 2pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;or so.  I can&#39;t wait to see the look on our cleric&#39;s face the next time he<br/>
&gt; &gt;is OOM and we desperately need a Greater Heal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Better pray that it isn&#39;t out of charges.<br/>
