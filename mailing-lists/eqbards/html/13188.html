<div id="ygrps-yiv-270382271">Hmmm, my character on the new server is a wizard - never had a wizard<br/>
before.  And *I* haven&#39;t died in 2 weeks.<br/>

The poor bard in our group on the other hand suffers pretty much as I did<br/>
on Veeshan.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Regardless of whether bards are or are not hybrids, I think Verant&#39;s <br/>
&gt;publicly expressed logic for why some classes get bind is easy to apply to <br/>
&gt;bards.  They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I <br/>
&gt;contend that bards die as often as any single casting class.  Regardless of <br/>
&gt;arguments about travel time (e.g. bards don&#39;t need binding because they run <br/>
&gt;so fast - which would also eliminate druids from needing bind, as they can <br/>
&gt;SoW, SoC, and port about), the reason why some classes have bind is claimed <br/>
&gt;to be due solely to the frequency of deaths of said class. </span></blockquote></div>
