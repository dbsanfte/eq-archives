&gt; Here is an idea on how they can actually test changes on the test server.<br/>
&gt; Allow people to export copies of their characters from regular servers but<br/>
&gt; give them a tag that indicates they are an imported character.  Their names<br/>
&gt; would show up as a different color, say yellow since that will visibly stand<br/>
&gt; out.  Yellow tagged characters can only be used on Test during specific<br/>
&gt; date/times to test specified areas of the game.  They don&#39;t gain experience<br/>
&gt; and they can&#39;t loot any items.  They don&#39;t need EXP or items because they<br/>
&gt; are there for one reason only, to test changes made to the game.  Once the<br/>
&gt; test period is complete, those characters can&#39;t log in to the Test server.<br/>
&gt; Yellow tagged characters also would not be allowed to group with normal<br/>
&gt; characters.  This scenario should alleviate any concerns of the regular Test<br/>
&gt; server players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>
