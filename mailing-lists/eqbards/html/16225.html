<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756816408"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Thanks for the info!  From this and the maps I believe the room that was<br/>
&gt;referred to earlier is the one leading to Sol B #3 zone line.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It looks as<br/>
&gt;if that would be an obvious place to pull to.  What&#39;s across the zone line<br/>
&gt;from it in Sol B?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bad scarry ugliness, in the distance at least, but as I said in the last bit<br/>
I never once died upon arriving in SolB, people don&#39;t seem to bail to that<br/>
zone much, possibly due to the likeliness of zoning into a screech of fire<br/>
goblins :o) But keep a lookout and be prepared to zone back to Sol A if the<br/>
growling gets too close.<br/>
