<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543112919">These guys I think will out aggro Lament song range. I&#39;ve been close enough<br/>
just to read their names, and I had at least 1 shaman and one guard (a<br/>
Shadowknight) come running. They don&#39;t have quite the aggro range of a<br/>
dragon, but a decent one nonetheless. I&#39;m not one who&#39;s camped them really,<br/>
only a driveby on occasion if they&#39;re uncamped when I breeze through. Goonda<br/>
drops a few nice pieces I can give to the guild. He&#39;s a pain to kite, as he<br/>
is a shaman, has SoW, heals, slows, nukes, etc... I get rid of his pet first<br/>
by charming Goonda, and have him beat his mutt down.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is &lt;30 for the guards, 35 tops for Goonda?<br/>
