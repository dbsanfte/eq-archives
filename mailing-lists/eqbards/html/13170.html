<div id="ygrps-yiv-269602432"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hrmph.  I had absolutely no problem at all keeping the extra<br/>
&gt; giant fixated on me instead of the cleric.  Heck, I even had<br/>
&gt; to stop weaving songs and attacking from time to time, or BOTH<br/>
&gt; giants would&#39;ve been attacking me.  :(  The really odd thing<br/>
&gt; is that I haven&#39;t had this problem (mob everyone is attacking<br/>
&gt; deciding I should die first) with normal mobs.  The ice giants<br/>
&gt; were the first time I&#39;ve faced this amount of bard hatred<br/>
&gt; since my low 20s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I must say that is very odd.  Anytime someone heals me (in <br/>
  either Plane for example) when we encounter a roaming mob <br/>
  which wails on me the mob instantly flocks to the healer <br/>
  and, until the enchanter mez&#39;s it, the mob will not leave <br/>
  the healer alone.  <br/>
