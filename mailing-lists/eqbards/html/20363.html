<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364475660">Dual wield is ok, but it&#39;s not earth shattering, esp now, as Draelon said,<br/>
that the 2hb weapons have started to get decent stats.<br/>
<br/>
The big difference, melee wise, is that we get 5 skill points per level in<br/>
our weapon skills (I misspoke myself earlier, you are correct it&#39;s melee<br/>
weapon skills that are different, not offense/defense)  whereas they get<br/>
only 4.  Which means that, in the long run, we will hit more often than<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
As to why your cleric isn&#39;t hitting very hard that is due to the fact that<br/>
he is only level 24 and his weapon skill is probably still below 100 (24*4<br/>
is only 96) and you do not get dmg bonuses until after 100 weapon skill (or<br/>
so I&#39;ve observed, that&#39;s not a hard fast 100% for sure thing but I&#39;m about<br/>
80-90% sure of that).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, bottom line:  Our melee skills are, and always have been, only<br/>
marginally better than that of a pure caster.  Our songs always have been,<br/>
and always will be (barring any major changes), far superior in dmg output,<br/>
and prevention, if used properly with instruments after level 18 or so.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with those that have posted that until the kunark release we<br/>
had more Melee POWER than pure casters due to the fact that 1hs weapons were<br/>
so out of balance with 2h weapons for various reasons but our melee SKILL<br/>
was always only slightly better.<br/>
<br/>
Dual Wield nowadays really isn&#39;t all that huge an advantage over 2h weapons<br/>
(if you&#39;re luggin kunark stuff around anyway).  Dual Wield plus Double<br/>
Attack is superior to 2h weapons but since we don&#39;t get double attack that&#39;s<br/>
a moot point.<br/>
<br/>
I still chuckle when I remember a post by someone a while back who thinks he<br/>
can out dmg a shadowknight in straight melee with no spells.  That&#39;s<br/>
something I&#39;d LOVE to see, especially since they fixed the disparity between<br/>
1h and 2h weapons.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, you&#39;re absolutely right, our weapon skills are better than<br/>
theirs (slightly) otherwise we&#39;re pretty much the same.  And our dodge is<br/>
only slightly higher.  At much higher levels the gap widens when we hit 53<br/>
(lol like many of us are gonna see 53 ;) and again at 56.  (Parry and<br/>
Riposte).  I personally doubt I will ever see 53 or 56... my time in EQ is<br/>
dwindling.  I dunno if I&#39;ll even reach 50 for Lyrnia (currently 45 and 2<br/>
bubbles).  And Lyrnali (my 51 bard on Test) has already been deleted in<br/>
disgust over the whole Test fiasco.<br/>
<br/>
Uhh jeez where&#39;d I go with this?  LOL<br/>

&gt; Clerics get 5 per level to offense and defense (I&#39;m pretty sure, my cleric<br/>
&gt; never melees).  However they get 4 per level to their weapon skills, where<br/>
&gt; as we get 5.  We also get dual weild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After level 20 where you start raising your max damage this seems to make<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; biggere difference.  My 24 cleric has NEVER hit for more than 13 with his<br/>
&gt; Bullsmasher (dam 6).  Keep in mind he has a str of 108 vs Elfson&#39;s 97.  I<br/>
&gt; tried meleeing same very green BB gnolls, and still never went over 13.<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure how the extra damage is calculated, but clearly the wis casters<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; behidn bards in this regard too.<br/>
