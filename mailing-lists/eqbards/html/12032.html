<div id="ygrps-yiv-810811073">Right, a good example is Lord Searfire in the Sol Ro temple. He gives<br/>
you a generic message, but nothing more. However, if you ask him &quot;what<br/>
about ronium?&quot; and have sufficient faction, he makes a secondary<br/>
statement with a braceketed term that yields the Sol Cauldron. Searfire<br/>
never mentions Ronium - the paladins in Rathe Mountains tell you to see<br/>
Searfire about it. Also note asking things like &quot;What about armor of<br/>
Ro?&quot; What about paladin armor&quot; etc yield no results, only the speech<br/>
trigger &#39;Ronium&#39; brought up further conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if the same held true for the bardic weapon - perhaps<br/>
some NPC somewhere tells you to ask Walthin about &quot;the bard sword&quot; or<br/>
something, and walthin doesn&#39;t respond to the prompt unless you ask him<br/>
about the specific name of the weapon.<br/>
