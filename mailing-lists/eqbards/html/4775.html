<div id="ygrps-yiv-907219648"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is also happening in Brell Serilis (level 2 Bar SHM).  I <br/>
&gt; petitioned<br/>
&gt; and the answer I got was to beg from higher level players.  Some help.<br/>
&gt; Personally, I dislike beggars and will never beg for <br/>
&gt; anything.  It&#39;s too<br/>
&gt; bad that the GM&#39;s either won&#39;t or aren&#39;t allowed to help with <br/>
&gt; this legit<br/>
&gt; problem.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem appears to be fixed now so the point is moot, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
totally absurd that they encourage begging and twinking when it&#39;s extremely<br/>
easy to see what level you are, and that you don&#39;t have any food, water or<br/>
at the least, a default weapon. Now, if the GM&#39;s giving you your items back<br/>
requires that they come to you, and trade the items to you then I can<br/>
understand them not wanting to travel for hours to hundreds of people doing<br/>
that. But if it&#39;s just a matter of typing something like &quot;give equip #104<br/>
player_name&quot; then there&#39;s no reason for them not to have done it.<br/>
<br/>
My main complaint (sorry, ranting here a bit) now is that on Veeshan (and<br/>
other servers) it seems that we get a 2 minute warning whenever the server<br/>
is going to go down. Last night a GM comes on and makes an announcement that<br/>
the server is coming down - log off now. About a minute later he makes<br/>
another announcement. Then less than a minute later the server goes down.<br/>
Now excuse the heck out of me, but what about people in the middle of<br/>
seriously hard fights or deep in a dangerous dungeon? How about fighting in<br/>
the water in the Oasis? They&#39;re supposed to leave the fight, get out of the<br/>
water sit and camp (without being chased & attacked) within a minute or two?<br/>
Methinks not. My aggrivation comes after having sat on the boat for 20<br/>
minutes, hitting the final zone to my destination and then the server going<br/>
down before I could reach the dock or jump in the water. Server comes back<br/>
up and guess what.. I&#39;m in the OOT zone heading back to where I started,<br/>
looking forward to another 30-40 minutes on the dang boat. Grrr.. A 10<br/>
minute warning is all I ask. Is that so much? People on other servers said<br/>
they get that, why can&#39;t Veeshan-ians?</div>
