&gt; I tried to Chain/Fear Choon the other night at level 31.  My Fear just<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t seem to be taking hold on this guy.  It was like he was out of range<br/>
&gt; (no resist message), but he was hitting me for 60s and 70s.  I dutifully<br/>
&gt; stood at his feet Screeching while he pummeled me trying to get it to take<br/>
&gt; hold.  Screech *finally* worked and he turned and fled.  I had exactly 12<br/>
&gt; HPs left at that point, so I decided chasing after him was probably a bad<br/>
&gt; idea.<br/>

have to be done from melee range, they also seem to have extended<br/>
giant&#39;s melee range to a huge distance. Giants can now hit you from an<br/>
insanely long way away compared to back when I first hunted them several<br/>
months ago at 30th level.<br/>
