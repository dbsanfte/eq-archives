&gt; &gt;   Now I don&#39;t want to be a spoil sport but central loot collection and<br/>
&gt; &gt; no split schemes seem to me to have too many bugs to allow to be used in<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups I am in. If you need money my opinion is &quot;Alpha auto on&quot; is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only way to go !! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having played thousands of card and board games since college, and having been <br/>
scorekeeper for more than 95% of them, I am quite comfortable with calling alpha <br/>
loot order.  I don&#39;t like FFA loot at all, for three reasons:  1)  it cheats the <br/>
spellcasters, who are too far from the action to get to loot the &quot;good&quot; bodies <br/>
(plus I&#39;d rather have them sitting on their tushies medding than running around <br/>
madly trying to get their fair share of treasure); 2) nobody ever thinks that <br/>
they&#39;re looting their fair share of FFA bodies; and 3) too many people leave the <br/>
&quot;junk&quot; bodies behind, then mentally count them off against you if you choose to <br/>
loot them yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if split is on or not; I usually call no-split because it evens out in <br/>
the long run, and some people really don&#39;t like it.  (I think their reasoning is <br/>
wrong; I don&#39;t believe that auto-split makes change, it just divides up whatever <br/>
coins are there, which doesn&#39;t increase the total amount of copper or silver.)<br/>
<br/>
I am not high enough in level to have gone to places where there is one uber-mob <br/>
and a bunch of much less worthwhile loot targets.  It seems that random selection <br/>
is reasonable here, although alpha loot starting at a random spot in the alphabet, <br/>
then ensuring that the older party members get a loot before replacements, seems <br/>
more equitable.<br/>
