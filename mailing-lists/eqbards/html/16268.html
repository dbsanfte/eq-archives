<div id="ygrps-yiv-765265124">Hee hee!  We have a cleric in our guild that we always count as a 1/2<br/>
warrior + 1/2 wizard when deciding if our group is balanced.  He once sent a<br/>
screenshot to the guild-list from an adventure where several people died do<br/>
to lack of healing and wondered how with two clerics that happened.  The<br/>
answer presented by his screen was very telling, at level 15 he had only 7<br/>
spells memorized, 1 heal, 3 summoning, 2 DD, and gate.  Needless to say we<br/>
were in shock.  In the middle of a romp thru Najena, this guy has summon<br/>
food, summon water, and that Hammer spell memm&#39;d.  What a maroon.  His name<br/>
appropriately is Banestrike.  We have trained him to be a bit better, but<br/>
he&#39;s still not really a cleric and we never count on him as such.  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t surprise me one bit if he is specialized in evocation.  He&#39;s the<br/>
only cleric I know who though Befallen was way too tough a dungeon.  Of<br/>
course since he was using his generic DD&#39;s instead of his undead specific<br/>
ones (which he hadn&#39;t bought yet) I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.<br/>

[snip]<br/>
<br/>
Back in my early 20&#39;s I met a cleric in Mistmoore who told the group he<br/>
planned to specialize in evocation and had chosen a cleric because<br/>
Wizards couldn&#39;t wear enough armor. I think he made it to the mid 30&#39;s<br/>
before his reputation as the cleric who didn&#39;t heal kept him from<br/>
getting groups anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
At least for the first few months of a server&#39;s life, it&#39;s a very small<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
He probably restarted as a druid. <br/>
