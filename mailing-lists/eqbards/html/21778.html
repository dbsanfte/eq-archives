Did you read the post?  I mean, I may tend to turn a cynical eye to things<br/>
Gordon says, but even so I can&#39;t see how even the most optimistic of people<br/>
could find that post anything but an insult.  There was no promise to look<br/>
at anything within any sort of definable time frame.  Gordon said the skill<br/>
caps would be raised, probably to the 235 the other casters have.  Other<br/>
than that we got zero in the way of positive response.  saying that Summon<br/>
Food might be inappropriate as an effect and that they would look at it<br/>
again was nothing different from the same sort of brush off we have gotten<br/>
before.  There was no battle, we were told in no uncertain terms that A: we<br/>
are not a high priority, nor is anything related to our class, and B: the<br/>
songs which are ineffective or useless are so by design.  I&#39;m way past down.<br/>
I&#39;m at resigned.  Acceptance, the final phase of being cured of the notion<br/>
that Verant gives a damn.  I&#39;m also secure in the knowledge that neither I,<br/>
nor 90% of my guild will ever buy a future Verant product.<br/>

As I mentioned in that thread, you can&#39;t expect to win everything in one<br/>
battle.  We recieved a great many concessions yesterday, and as such,<br/>
instead of getting down about it, I feel much more optimistic about future<br/>
enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
Things like Lullaby and Chains won&#39;t be fixed until someone at VI begins<br/>
playing a bard as their primary character.  That, therefore, is something<br/>
that I am willing to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; for now.  The fact that Abashi<br/>
answered the whoe demmed list also gives me great optimism.  Why?  Because I<br/>
think Abashi now feels great empathy for bards?  Heck no!  Read between the<br/>
lines of his own post. Someone &quot;handed&quot; him the list that came from the<br/>
Concert Hall?  He has now recognized that the Concert Hall is the main hub<br/>
for the bardic community.<br/>
<br/>
The list of issues has been posted and re-posted on the EQ boards, and<br/>
summarily ignored by Gordo lo these many months (except for the one time<br/>
where he just picked a few weenie items out and posted on them).  Also, the<br/>
Concert Hall has been KNOWN and MENTIONED in many posts as the main bardic<br/>
gathering place, yet he has posted that any place like that doesn&#39;t &quot;truly&quot;<br/>
represent a given community.  Now we have an about-face, and that tells me<br/>
that someone above GW&#39;s head got wind of bards being ignored, watched it go<br/>
on for a while, then came down on him.  How else would you explain the<br/>
instrument skill caps getting raised so quickly?  That&#39;s a MAJOR balancing<br/>
issue for this class, yet he tossed out the &quot;it will be in the next patch&quot;<br/>
phrase as if it happened everyday.<br/>
<br/>
Patience my friends... patience.<br/>

&gt;apparently many of our songs are &quot;working as intended&quot; or &quot;may need to be<br/>
&gt;re-evaluated at some point&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;this may be the end for me.<br/>
