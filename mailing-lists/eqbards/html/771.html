A bard&#39;s normal skill cap in Forage is 40, and Hide is 35.  As a wood elf,<br/>
you STARTED with 50 in both, so you&#39;ve exceeded the cap, thanks to your<br/>
racial choice.<br/>

&gt;&gt;- Wood Elves end up with better forage skill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you played a wood elf bard to high levels?  Maybe it&#39;s just my<br/>
&gt;character that&#39;s glitched, but I found that forage and hide are buggy.  I<br/>
&gt;have never been able to train either of them past their starting values.<br/>
&gt; As a bard I&#39;m supposed to be able to train forage at 12th level and hide<br/>
&gt;at 25th level, but they both said I&#39;d reached my maximum limit when I<br/>
&gt;reached those levels and attempted to train.  (I don&#39;t know the numerical<br/>
&gt;value, but it&#39;s very bad.)<br/>
