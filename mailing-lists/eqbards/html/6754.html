&gt; The problem I&#39;ve found that ever since the bard melee skills started<br/>
&gt; capping, it becomes more and more important to treat them as a caster<br/>
&gt; (meaning the tanks stop to pull creatures off of them) than as a full<br/>
&gt; fledged melee class, where the group happily allows 3 things to beat on<br/>
&gt; the bard while trying to kill something else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. I&#39;ve always said clerics are a bard&#39;s best friend. At least you<br/>
have noticed that. This is why I find it so frustrating that I can&#39;t<br/>
pull a mob off the cleric anymore. And it&#39;s worse without a cleric. I<br/>
got the itch to play again last week so I logged in and ended up in a<br/>
party with 2 rangers, a warrior and wizard deep in Sol B hunting bats.<br/>
Got 3 bats in one pull than the extra 2 decided to beat on me. I got<br/>
real low and no one could get them off, then of course when I was at a<br/>
bubble the third frenzied on me too and down I went. Then, after I found<br/>
a friendly cleric to res me, a lava duct crawler showed up just as she<br/>
cast the res spell, so I reappeared, under the influence of the new<br/>
resurrect effect, and it immediately dotted me with it&#39;s blood boil<br/>
dispite being in combat with others.  And, before she could med up<br/>
enough mana for another res my second corpse disappeared as it was<br/>
empty. Sigh. A full bubble out of 49 down the tubes.<br/>
