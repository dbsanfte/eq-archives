<div id="ygrps-yiv-684857334">YES! This is what I was complaining about in the first place (in<br/>
hind-sight - I am sorry for the minor flame-war that broke out - I guess I<br/>
misunderstood as much as I was misunderstood)..<br/>
<br/>
    The actions of Verant are - If you are a Bard or Necro - you are<br/>
required to get someone to help you (levitate and gate).  But for other<br/>
classes they don&#39;t require you to get help.  If they were consistent - they<br/>
would tell all other classes to get a bard/necro (OR again - the Locate Rod)<br/>
to retrieve the corpse.<br/>
<br/>
    On further thought - I suppose this isn&#39;t entirely reasonable - the<br/>
bard/necro would actually have to loot the corpse for them - which is<br/>
problematic with the concerns of finding someone you can trust enough.  On<br/>
the other hand - they could put the Locate Rod for sale by nearby Vendor<br/>
Druid...<br/>
<br/>
    But regardless - someone posted an email from a GM about how Verant<br/>
wants to have consistent policies and avoid favoritism; but I think this<br/>
situation is exactly the opposite.  To be consistent; regardless of the<br/>
abilities of you class - corpse retrieval in lava should be done the same<br/>
for all classes.  We&#39;re not talking trivial tasks here - it literally took<br/>
me many hours (and three of my deaths and two of my druid friends deaths) to<br/>
get my corpse back...<br/>
<br/>
Okay enough of a rant on this subject (your probably sick of it by now)...<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So if you aren&#39;t a bard/necro, the correct course of action<br/>
&gt; would indeed be to get a GM or guide to retrieve the corpse<br/>
&gt; for you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>
&gt; your corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>
&gt; the original poster was griping about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless I&#39;m remembering wrong and the /corpse command targets<br/>
&gt; the corpse for you...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
It doesn&#39;t... </span></blockquote></div>
