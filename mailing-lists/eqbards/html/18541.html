<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dragon Raids:<br/>
&gt; Elemental+Guardian.  On Nag I tend to get right under his <br/>
&gt; tummy and punch<br/>
&gt; him in the junks for 10-15 or so.  This is by far the most <br/>
&gt; fun I have in EQ<br/>
&gt; and where I&#39;ve got my most treasured screenshot:  You punch <br/>
&gt; Lord Nagafen<br/>
&gt; for 8 points.  You have slain Lord Nagafen.  You recieve <br/>
&gt; party experience. <br/>
&gt; Welcome to level 49!  In the loot window is my drum and orb. =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now that is a dragon raid.  get the kill, get the exp, level, and get 2<br/>
items =)  hmm what do i play... obviously elemental no matter what.  then i<br/>
mix in VoV since augmentation can get cancelled.  i haven&#39;t played guardian<br/>
in a while cause normal MR buffs seem to be enough to thwart dragon fear.  i<br/>
don&#39;t punch, but i am right under his belly as well.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Vox has a much larger melee range and we (my guild) tends to <br/>
&gt; spread out a<br/>
&gt; bit more in her lair, so I usually don&#39;t get to stand right <br/>
&gt; under her and<br/>
&gt; have to move around quit a bit more.  I still melee with the <br/>
&gt; ol&#39; wood elf<br/>
&gt; fists of might!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we pull vox out to the ramp outside the movable rock that opens to her lair,<br/>
then we push her down into that corner.  so i am still right under her belly<br/>
and there is no chance to get feared into the bear pit.<br/>
 <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My current Superman outfit is red dragon scale, rubi boots, elf hide<br/>
&gt; gloves, 2 orbs with the rest lambent.  I&#39;m going to try for <br/>
&gt; Wolverine now<br/>
&gt; that there is a pair of claws that can be wore in the off <br/>
&gt; hand... what helm<br/>
&gt; is black plate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the helm you get off deepwater gobs for the lambent quest is black.  those<br/>
duel claws look cool, but you soon tire of having a 7 33 weapon in your<br/>
off-hand =)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On Singing Steel:<br/>
&gt; The effects are that bad, maybe its just how I play.  Having <br/>
&gt; food and water<br/>
&gt; is nice, enduring breath is great for exploring too.  The AC <br/>
&gt; is ridiculous<br/>
&gt; however.  Each peice could use a +2-3 point boost *minimum*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think the boots and gloves (and all other classes common drops so far) may<br/>
not have the best AC and stats, but i think the other items (legs, BP for<br/>
example) may turn out to have phenomenal stats, as did the cobalt greaves we<br/>
got a warrior in my guild<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/cobaltgreaves.html)">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/cobaltgreaves.html)</a> which are just<br/>
absoultely amazing.  maybe bards can look forward to similar stuff on other<br/>
pieces.  and hey, i actually ran out of water the other day and grabbed the<br/>
boots out of my ee bag for a minute to make some =)  and i do wear the<br/>
gloves, just to be a little different and you can&#39;t go wrong with enduring<br/>
breath as an effect.  looks like the BP of each melee class could have<br/>
effect: gate.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Uberguilds:<br/>
&gt; I hate the term but my guild (LoS, Legacy of Steel) gets <br/>
&gt; accused of it too.<br/>
&gt;  We&#39;re small as things go, 50 real people but we can do <br/>
&gt; anything in the<br/>
&gt; game at anytime and we always share our info, tactics and <br/>
&gt; assistance once<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re confident its correct, so I tend to reject a lot of the <br/>
&gt; critism that<br/>
&gt; is leveled against us by a very small very vocal segment of <br/>
&gt; the server.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our leadership is pretty strict about keeping information within the guild.<br/>
we work very hard and sacrifice a lot to accomplish goals we set out for,<br/>
and i guess they just would rather keep what we do our own, and let others<br/>
accomplish their own goals.  so i guess i am in a sense a hypocrite when i<br/>
ask others for info, which isn&#39;t often but i shouldn&#39;t do it if i know i can<br/>
return the favor.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On Loot:<br/>
&gt; We NEVER random, we NEVER do multiguild events.  Our GM (or <br/>
&gt; officer if he<br/>
&gt; is not present) calls loot and that&#39;s that - we work so well together<br/>
&gt; because we&#39;re like a family.  Who ever gets the drops we all <br/>
&gt; consider it to<br/>
&gt; have been worth it, that&#39;s just how we are.  In the rare pick <br/>
&gt; up groups I<br/>
&gt; join (rare because we almost always are doing some sort of <br/>
&gt; event) I simply<br/>
&gt; fore go loot because of all the difficulties and hard <br/>
&gt; feelings that often<br/>
&gt; arise.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we have a complex loot system based on time of participation which i&#39;ve<br/>
talked about before.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On Weapons Vs Songs:<br/>
&gt; If we&#39;re in a situation that requires tactics and team work I <br/>
&gt; almost always<br/>
&gt; opt for weapons, since our DoTs complicate mes.  I also go <br/>
&gt; with weapons in<br/>
&gt; a &quot;normal&quot; group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same, i have always been a battle bard myself.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On Kurnark Loot:<br/>
&gt; I HATE it not being NODROP most of all, but also I HATE <br/>
&gt; soloable yard trash<br/>
&gt; at the zone line dropping stuff better than stuff my guild <br/>
&gt; spend MONTHS<br/>
&gt; /played in planes for and I HATE the Monty Haul stats.  I had <br/>
&gt; a really long<br/>
&gt; rant typed out but in the end I deleted because there&#39;s no <br/>
&gt; need to subject<br/>
&gt; you all to it. =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>big ditto.  all that time for planes/dragon/god armor and weapons, and<br/>
better stuff drops randomly in kunark.  oh well, though there are items i<br/>
would like to have, nothing is really amazingly better than what i have or<br/>
has me falling out of my chair yet.  heh i&#39;m sure the higher level people<br/>
get and deeper they go in the new dungeons, that kind of stuff will show up.<br/>
<br/>
now look what you did Tork, two long novels =b<br/>
