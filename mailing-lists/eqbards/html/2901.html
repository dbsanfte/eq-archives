<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510172387">I bought a pair of these last week for 50 plat, no idea if that is a good<br/>
price, bad price, or what, but I wanted them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, bard and rogue only<br/>
<br/>
and yes, agil and dex boosts of 5.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t ask the guy where he gottum.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I may have paid too much, but had someone offer me 100 plat for them,<br/>
and I turned em down.<br/>

&gt;I am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>
&gt;+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>
&gt;someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>
&gt;in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>
&gt;never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>
&gt;sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>
&gt;invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>
&gt;course, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>
