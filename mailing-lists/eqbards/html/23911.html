<div id="ygrps-yiv-25416835">actually i was under the impression that druid and necro abilities were being<br/>
nerfed in order to promote grouping vs soloing.  note that the necro gained<br/>
some group oriented abilities during this time, including mana transfer and<br/>
health transfer.  the druid was already a pretty kickass group member and were<br/>
probably overpowered already.<br/>

&gt;It is the primary reason druid and necromancer abilities have been nerfed<br/>
&gt;for the last ohh 2 years.<br/>
