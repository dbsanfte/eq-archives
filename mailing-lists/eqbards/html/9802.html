<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314140812">THe last few days while in search of Griffennes to hunt for my Griffenne<br/>
charms I found that greens can be you best friends while hunting with<br/>
charm.  Normally we use charm on two similar blues and have them beat each<br/>
other senseless.  Now what happens if you are unable to find 2 blues and<br/>
you really need to kill that Uber mob?  <br/>
<br/>
A few days ago me a level 27 bard and a my friend a level 29 wizzie<br/>
decided to kill Griffenne in hopes of me getting a wonderful bracer to add<br/>
to my collection.  What I noticed was that after two or three successful<br/>
charms on the Griff, my wizzie friend was able to nuke 3 times in a row<br/>
with his biggest nuke with out being agroed against.  Now what can you do<br/>
if you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a few times.<br/>
He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you completely.  Now find<br/>
a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>
attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>
griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>
manner.<br/>
