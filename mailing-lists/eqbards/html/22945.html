<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-258819121">I was thinking South Ro as opposed to Innothoule.  I do think we will see a<br/>
bind point for Dark races up north, maybe in BlackBurrow?  A bind point in<br/>
North Karana at the gypsy camp might work too.<br/>
<br/>
In Kunark I&#39;m not sure.  Binding there is annoying but I don&#39;t see any<br/>
obvious places for it to be added.  Something near Kaesora would seem<br/>
logical as that place is a ghost town most nights.<br/>

Pretty close to my guesses.  Though I&#39;m betting no on the Innothule, Feerot<br/>
ones...<br/>
Iagree on Lavastorm, South Karana, Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.<br/>
<br/>
I think they may add a coule in Kunark too, outside Kaesora  and Droga<br/>
(Field of Bone and Frontier Mts)<br/>
