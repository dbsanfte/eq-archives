<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-202600767">That&#39;s good to hear.  I saw the damage figures and the potential double<br/>
resist and thought my lvl 30 song might turn out to be as unexciting as the<br/>
level 29 one I just got.  It still seems peculiar that our level 2 song<br/>
outdamages it though.  At what level will my songs start moving up the<br/>
scale?  I noticed last night something that has been bugging me a bit for a<br/>
couple of weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
Here I am 29th level and except for special situations I still pretty much<br/>
use mostly the same songs I did at 10th.  I&#39;m using Anthem (or Chant of<br/>
Battle depending on enchanter), Jig, Hymn, Accelerando, and Chords.  Of the<br/>
other 3 slots only Largo&#39;s and Psalm of Warmth see extensive usage.  Charm I<br/>
keep for mega taunting off our casters.  So basically 5 of my 8 spell slots<br/>
are still 10th level or below.  I tried using Denon&#39;s instead of Chords for<br/>
a while, but the double resists on Denon&#39;s definitely lower its performance<br/>
significantly.  I found it to be resisted by whites and up 14.7% more than<br/>
Chords.  That lowered its damage potential to below Chords.<br/>
<br/>
Even in all instrument I&#39;ve found that in my combo of Largo&#39;s, Chords, Hymn,<br/>
and Denon&#39;s, its Chords and Hymn that have the most effect.  Denon&#39;s gets<br/>
resisted too often, and Largo&#39;s isn&#39;t far behind.  These experiences leave<br/>
me wondering how songs with 3 or 4 effects will ever stick.  What sort of<br/>
resists are you higher levels seeing?  Maybe I&#39;ve just had a bad run of<br/>
randoms lately but from what I&#39;ve seen, songs with more than one effect just<br/>
get resisted way too much.  A grouping class ends up fighting mostly stuff<br/>
that cons above them which just magnifies the problem at least in my<br/>
experience the last month or two.<br/>

I&#39;ve found FCC to be pretty reliable against yellow and below mobs.  The<br/>
double<br/>
resist rate problems you have with Lullaby don&#39;t appear to work the same way<br/>
with this song.  In fact, I&#39;m inclined to believe the mob only gets one<br/>
chance<br/>
to resist.  And if it sticks, then it helps getting your other songs to<br/>
stick.<br/>
I&#39;ve had this song memmed every since I got it.<br/>

So FCC never outdamages our level 2 song???<br/>
<br/>
With double the resist rate (due to two effects) and less damage is this<br/>
really worthwhile for the -MR?<br/>
