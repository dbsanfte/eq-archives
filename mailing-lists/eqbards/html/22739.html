<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647576136">Wondering why you would call it an exploit?  Players, especially clerics,<br/>
force link death/camp out all the time when major raids go bad.  <br/>

Sounds to me like an exploit that I wouldn&#39;t care to discuss. :-P<br/>

&gt;A group of folks were in the Hole to help someone with their epic quest.<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t know the details of the quest, but you have to talk/give something to<br/>
&gt;one of the NPCs there.  So a cleric by mistake aggroed the quest NPC.  If<br/>
&gt;the groups killed the mob, they wouldn&#39;t be able to complete that portion<br/>

&gt;cleric.  Since no one else was on the NPC&#39;s hate list, once the cleric died<br/>
&gt;the NPC would not be aggro anymore and they could finish the quest.  The<br/>
&gt;cleric (59th level with an AC over 1100) thought he might have a chance of<br/>
&gt;surviving if he went LD.  So he turned on autoattack and then typed in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now here is where the funny part starts.  The cleric had Complete Heal<br/>
&gt;loaded in the first spell gem.  Apparently when you go linkdead, the game<br/>
&gt;automatically switches you over to NPC AI.  If you can cast spells,<br/>
&gt;apparently the only one the AI will cast is whichever one is loaded in the<br/>
&gt;first spell gem.  So as everyone else watched the NPC beat on the cleric,<br/>
&gt;every once in a while (when he wasn&#39;t stunned) the cleric was able to get a<br/>
&gt;CH spell off.  He was able to cast CH enough that he didn&#39;t die before his<br/>
&gt;character disappeared from the server.  To say the least he was quite<br/>
&gt;pleased when he discovered he didn&#39;t die after going LD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge to somehow help<br/>
 </span></blockquote>us<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;survive a fight after we go linkdead.  Fear sounds like a good option but<br/>
&gt;then again it could potentially screw over the rest of the group by causing<br/>
&gt;a train.  The new Shield of Songs is a possibility as well.  Third option<br/>
&gt;would be whatever song that you think would best help your party kill the<br/>
&gt;mob(s) you were attacking before you went LD.  That would be situationally<br/>
&gt;dependent on where you were fighting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone got other suggestions?<br/>
