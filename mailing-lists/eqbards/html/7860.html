<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655613858">Its probably the best piece of equipment my bard has.  It has saved my life<br/>
innumerable times.  It has one charge of 80 pt Healing.  That almost 25%<br/>
additional hp&#39;s at least until 17th level.  It is rechargeable as you have<br/>
seen, although I have to sing Carillion to get it recharged as my<br/>
Indifferent faction isn&#39;t good enough to get Hendi to recharge it.  To use<br/>
it, it needs to be in an open inventory slot, or on your finger.  You target<br/>
yourself and rt click it.  It cannot be interrupted and has no casting time.<br/>
Just like spring crystals etc.  You cannot be actively singing a song (song<br/>
buttons all grayed out) or it won&#39;t work.  Its amazing the critters yu can<br/>
beat with just a extra 25% or so hp&#39;s.  I imagine it will become less useful<br/>
after 25th level or so, but so far it has saved me and other party members<br/>
several times when the cleric has screeched OOM!<br/>

Pardon my ignorance, but what exactly does the Squad Ring do?  I&#39;m assuming<br/>
it&#39;s a good thing for Bards to have?<br/>

when I got the ring (It was just yesterday evening, so even my swiss-cheese<br/>
memory recalls it).<br/>

&gt; you should accidently give your ring to Hendri before singing<br/>

&gt; the marshall and get another ring.<br/>

don&#39;t have to cause two more species&#39; extinction to do it! : D<br/>
