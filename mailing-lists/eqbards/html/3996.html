<div id="ygrps-yiv-225538296">How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
be?  I have both, and was planning on using them at level 17 for dual wield.<br/>
Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>
a Dragoon Dirk.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>
