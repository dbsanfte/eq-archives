<div id="ygrps-yiv-878798475">Huh.  I&#39;m a female half-elf, and the Shin Greaves look just like normal steel color to me.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently quite clashing, with bronze breastplate, shin greaves, Lambent boots and vambraces,<br/>
snake skin gloves (of all things!), hero bracer (which is GREEN), bracer of erollsi, and<br/>
blackened iron crown (looks like banded helm).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to being mostly blue (except for the green hero bracer).<br/>

&gt; &gt; An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing wood-elf males out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>
&gt; &gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose<br/>
&gt; tinged<br/>
&gt; &gt; silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
&gt; &gt; examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf<br/>
&gt; females<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>
&gt; &gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is<br/>
&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; &gt; then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
