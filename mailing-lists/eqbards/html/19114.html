Selo&#39;s Song of Travel is a high level Bard song that grants a faster run<br/>
speed, levitate, invis, and see-invis. We&#39;ve heard complaints from a few<br/>
bards that the invis component of the song hurts the song overall, due to<br/>
events occurring that break invis cause all of the song effects to be<br/>
broken.<br/>
As such, we&#39;re considering removing the invis and see-invis effects from the<br/>
song, figuring that bards could always twist the other song in if they want<br/>
the other effects.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

I&#39;d love to comment myself, but I&#39;m a few levels off that atm, so I won&#39;t<br/>
plague the board with my ignorance. ;)<br/>
<br/>
However, isn&#39;t it true that twisting anything with Sonorous Clouding will<br/>
cancel clouding?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll happily update the post from time-to-time for those that don&#39;t have<br/>
