<div id="ygrps-yiv-645646219">True, but if they borrowed from the levitate code, which apparently &#39;knows&#39;<br/>
where the current surface level is, or the falling code, they could<br/>
accomplish that I think.  There may be some untrivial issues, but zone based<br/>
data ranges ought to be able to solve that.  They can&#39;t afford to implement<br/>
that kind of check for things that happen instantaneously on the fly like<br/>
movement for bandwidth/delay reasons, but who will notice if a mob that<br/>
spawns after a random amount of time spawns after a random amount of time<br/>
plus a processing time to be sure he&#39;s not in a wall.  It would all be<br/>
server side computationally so shouldn&#39;t impact performance significantly<br/>
unless they are pushing their boxes immensely.  I imagine their box usage<br/>
looks a lot like some of ours, cpu usage at 80% available, io bound at 60%.<br/>

Heh, that&#39;s all we&#39;d need is monsters popping up in the middle of walls, or<br/>
halfway in sloped floors, then<br/>
falling into netherspace to attack us with impunity.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a<br/>
bad idea, but I think you&#39;re<br/>
oversimplifying the difficulty in implementation.  It has already been<br/>
demonstrated how fragile the thin<br/>
plane of ground we walk on is.  Certainly with respect to getting things to<br/>
stay on that ground, and not<br/>
below it.<br/>

&gt; I can think of a couple ways to fix that fairly easily.  Whenever a Mob<br/>
&gt; spawns, just offset its location by a random number in the X and Y<br/>
&gt; directions and pop him to the nearest surface.  This would make the game a<br/>
&gt; heck of a lot more difficult at higher levels where a spawn that pops up<br/>

&gt; their design is any good, this should be easy to implement.<br/>

&gt; In all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>
&gt; corner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>
&gt; predictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>
&gt; the same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>
&gt; only things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>
&gt; and exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; virtually impossible to make things challenging - once you<br/>
&gt; figure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>
&gt; challenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>
