<div id="ygrps-yiv-916832126">The difference between EQ and AC then, according to what I&#39;ve read, is that<br/>
the mobs completely forget about you after a time, there is no increased<br/>
agro radius, and its safe for you to turn around and go back.  Now if you<br/>
get to close to the mob the second time around thats a completely different<br/>
story.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; EQ mobs will do this too, but they remember you unless you camp or zone.  <br/>
&gt; And their agro radius to you is huge afterwards.  I used to out run<br/>
&gt; bandits <br/>
&gt; in West Commons all the time and see this.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t played it but supposedly Asheron&#39;s Call has this kind of<br/>
&gt; feature.<br/>
&gt; &gt;From what I have heard, if you are faster than a mob and are running away<br/>
&gt; &gt;from it, after a certain amount of time it will lose interest in you.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;would assume EQ programmers could figure out a way to implement a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt;feature in EQ if they wanted to.  Question is do they want to?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The real solution is a time-based hatred demotion system,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where a mob&#39;s hatred for you (as well as your kill-credit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; potential) declines over time the mob is not being attacked.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes this would be difficult; but if you&#39;re going to fix<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something, fix it right.  Unless the problem is very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; detrimental to the game (which feign death wasn&#39;t), don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; waste time going from one broken state to another broken<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; state.<br/>
