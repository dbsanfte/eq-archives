a green Nektulos inky guard despite about 15-20 attempts.  I<br/>

(med-high blue) in Cazic last night.  Though I did botch it<br/>

the prot, then charmed the fanatic or other prot while I ran.  <br/>
Instead I just ran, and with my drum I was so fast I missed<br/>
the exit from the maze, got lost, and died.  Grrrr - that&#39;s 6<br/>
times I&#39;ve died so far at level 32.  The most deaths I&#39;ve had<br/>
in a level prior to this was 3...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I guess I need to work myself up to L33-35 so I can<br/>
start using it on griffins and giants.  Right now at L32 it&#39;s<br/>
not reliable enough.  The main problem is that the servers are<br/>
so crowded it&#39;s tough to find two &quot;open&quot; mobs near each other<br/>
to play around with.  In fact a lot of times, people seem to<br/>
ignore that the mobs are fighting each other and just decide<br/>
to take one.  I had a group do this, then kill my (former) pet<br/>
while I was explaining to them that I was charming them and<br/>
could they please leave me alone.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes you do.  But if your pet is not charmed when the creature<br/>
dies (due to a DoT, other players, freak timing), you will not<br/>
get experience since your former pet did most of the damage -<br/>
the corpse will disappear in this case.  If the corpse did not<br/>
disappear, someone else probably cast a DoT on the creature<br/>
and &quot;stole&quot; the kill from you.  There *may* be a bug where<br/>
your pet gets the kill and you don&#39;t get credit for the kill -<br/>
it&#39;s happened to my enchanter once with his animation.  I<br/>
triple checked the messages and replayed the entire fight back<br/>
in my head and I am absolutely sure nobody else damaged my<br/>
target.  Yet it died, left a corpse, and I didn&#39;t get the<br/>
kill.<br/>
