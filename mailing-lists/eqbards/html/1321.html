&gt; &gt;&gt; A question about the lullaby spell.  Is its area of effect centered<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; on you as the caster, or can you target something some distance from<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; you and it is centered on your target?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Centered on you.  Goatnatos&#39; guide says it also clears the<br/>
&gt; &gt;hate list.  Has anyone found this to be the case?  They always<br/>
&gt; &gt;seem to attack me when they wake up, no matter how far I run<br/>
&gt; &gt;away. I tried testing it on mobs other people were attacking<br/>
&gt; &gt;but the results were inconclusive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OOooh nononononono - It INCREASES the Hate list, as near as I can tell.<br/>
&gt; Bards are public enemy #1 when singing this song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I know that.  What I was wondering was if someone has<br/>
fought a mob past half dead (at which point it would normally<br/>
be almost impossible to pull the mob off him), can you fire up<br/>
the song and mob will now attack the bard or the next person<br/>
to attack him?  That&#39;s what I was trying to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, even if this effect exists, hatred for the bard<br/>
seems to be excepted (stuff you put to sleep for a long time<br/>
will attack you until they die even though someone else is<br/>
killing it), which kinda makes it useless except for a<br/>
twinking exploit.<br/>
