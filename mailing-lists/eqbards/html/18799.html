&gt; &gt; Answer: 	&quot;Hmmm, me neither, hey that fishbone earring is popular,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being only level 14, I don&#39;t have the enduring breath song yet, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t it work like SoW?  If I&#39;m singing Selo&#39;s and someone tries to<br/>
cast SoW on a group member, it won&#39;t stick.  But if I stop singing,<br/>
and then they have SoW cast upon them, and then I start singing again,<br/>
the rest of the group gets Selo&#39;s, while the person SoW&#39;ed keeps his<br/>
SoW.  So assuming enduring breath works in the same way, if group<br/>
members get enduring breath cast on them before the bard sings his<br/>
song, they should be using the spell, while the bard is using the<br/>
song.<br/>
