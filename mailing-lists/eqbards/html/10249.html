<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563992939">I would like to see the addition of high level group gate song with it&#39;s own<br/>
special twist like this.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of gating your party to druid ruins, or some strange magical site,<br/>
the bard group gate would teleport everyone to one of the many Inns or<br/>
Tavern in Norath. This may be in a city, out on the country along a road, or<br/>
even out to places like the Ocean of Tears.  In order to get the song, you<br/>
would have to do a world-wide quest to visit each of these places and get<br/>
each one&#39;s verses (which may spawn many sub-quests) that would comprise the<br/>
final song which would be created from the combined verses at the end of the<br/>
quest.<br/>
<br/>
The actual mechanics of the song would be to begin singing it, and then have<br/>
a dialog or portion of the interface display the choices of where you would<br/>
like to be taken (kind of like a ranger&#39;s tracking screen). As a balancing<br/>
mechanism, once everyone in the party had been teleported they would all<br/>
roll against their alcohol tolerance skill to see how disoriented the songs<br/>
intoxicating lyrics had made them. Those that fail will stumble around drunk<br/>
for a time until it wears off.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d like to see a bind song!  hahaha, just kidding.<br/>
&gt; What I&#39;d really like to see is a memory blur song.<br/>

&gt; Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>
&gt; discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>
&gt; before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>
&gt; classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>
&gt; discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>
&gt; we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>
&gt; useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are<br/>
raises<br/>
&gt; to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>
&gt; disappointed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>
&gt; list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>
&gt; list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>
&gt; expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>
&gt; seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>
&gt; could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>
&gt; the lead on this:-)<br/>
