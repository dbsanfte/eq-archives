<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999810978">*grins* at Kitasi. Most of our guild&#39;s secondaries are there as well.<br/>
I, too, don&#39;t level that fast and I&#39;ve gone from 19 to almost 26 since<br/>
Kunark came out.<br/>
<br/>
The others of the secondaries, of course :P Are convinced that Kunark is a<br/>
deathtrap for 20s and won&#39;t come near the place :(<br/>

&gt;Definitely.  My guild has been so successful in the Lake of Ill Omen zone<br/>
&gt;that our entire guild roster from level 17-24 now resides in that zone.  It<br/>
&gt;took me about a week to convince one person to try it, but once they<br/>
&gt;realized I had made two levels there in a week they knew it must<br/>
&gt;be the land<br/>
&gt;of milk and honey.  I just don&#39;t level that fast. </span></blockquote></div>
