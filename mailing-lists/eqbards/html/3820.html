<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896374860">I know a lot of people don&#39;t trust it, but here&#39;s what I do. I leave my shield<br/>
(or second weapon) on my cursor. If you die or get disconnected the item just<br/>
goes back into your inventory so it is safe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>
&gt; (i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>
&gt; a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>
&gt; instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>
&gt; it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>
&gt; trying to switch weapons later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, =)<br/>
