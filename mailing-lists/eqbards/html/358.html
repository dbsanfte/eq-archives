<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588690276">Alas, I too have given in to vanity. I like the look of a long sword and<br/>
dagger. How does a 6th level accomplish this classic mold. I must admit it<br/>
is fun when asked, An I tell people I am below 17th level. They ask how did<br/>
you get duel wield? Usually I tell them. Except for one that kept pestering<br/>
me, without offering any help, while I was being attacked by 3 Fire Beatles.<br/>
After finishing my task, with less than 2 drops of blood left in my system,<br/>
I told him the following OOC.<br/>
<br/>
	There is an embedded Easter Egg in the software that the company does not<br/>
want people to know about. If you promise not to tell I will tell you. For<br/>
if it got out they will remove it. so whatever you do keep it to your self!<br/>
<br/>
	First, you have to go to the Theatre of Tranquility, &#39;Run&#39; to the top and<br/>
jump over the wall three times. Then walk to the dwarf rogue and say,<br/>
&#39;Co-co-ca-ju Miss, Robbenson.&#39;. And after dunking your head off the peer in<br/>
South Freeport while auctioning, &#39;Yes we have no bananas!&#39; You will get the<br/>
Dual Wield skill at a 31.5 rating.<br/>
<br/>
	After about an hour, my inquisitive friend returned saying it did not work.<br/>
I said oh I forgot, when jumping hold the ALT and A, P, R, I, L, then CTL<br/>
and F, O, O, L and S keys. After a long pause he was off again. I decided to<br/>
camp and leave for my new found friend alas did not get the joke. It is<br/>
amazing what some will do for dual wield...<br/>
<br/>
	Of course as we all know the dagger is not a weapon, but a parrying dagger<br/>
only usable as armor, not a weapon. It looks good, but does nothing but<br/>
maybe intimate someone on a PvP server into thinking you are of a higher<br/>
level than you really are.<br/>

&gt; Greetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>
&gt; Soebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>
&gt; a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>
&gt; with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>
&gt; slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>
&gt; sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>
&gt; switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>
&gt; you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>
&gt; level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>
