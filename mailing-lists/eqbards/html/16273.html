<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346700898">Ah. That makes sense. My regular group is me and a monk. And we rely on<br/>
the monk&#39;s Mend. (She keeps promising to learn Bind Wound and keeps<br/>
forgetting)<br/>
<br/>
Last night we had a real good adventure with a warrior and wizard who also<br/>
adventured together. The four of us did ReALLY good in Mistmoore. I just<br/>
wish it wasn&#39;t so late!<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m lucky in that my druid&#39;s main group already includes two clerics.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;only the emergency healer, and am the secondary nuker.  I am<br/>
&gt;generally right<br/>
&gt;there waded in swinging away and nuking/DoTing as I can get them in.  I<br/>
&gt;rarely get hit till the poor bard needs to back out or flee. </span></blockquote></div>
