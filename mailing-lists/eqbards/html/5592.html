<b>Subject:</b> Chain vs. snare <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-782978628">Let me give you a snarers perspective (my bard is only level 5, so I have no<br/>
      personal experience with chain, except when it cancels my snares.<br/>
<br/>
Snare is an amazing spell. It almost always lasts the entire combat. It&#39;s a good<br/>
      additional taunt for a ranger. When the creature turns to run, they run<br/>
      slowly. Eventually, they stop dead in their tracks and don&#39;t fight back.<br/>
      It&#39;s quick to cast, so I can get off many attempts in the course of a<br/>
      battle, which is useful is the MOB is red to me. The only limitation is<br/>
      that if my party is fighting a whole lot of monsters, I typically don&#39;t<br/>
      get around to snaring all of them. If the party is smart and concentrates<br/>
      on one mob at a time, then no problem. But if the fighting break up into<br/>
      multiple battles, I may not get to all of the monsters.<br/>
<br/>
Now druids, often aren&#39;t very good at snaring because they are too busy with<br/>
      healing and burning and casting swarm. But, as a ranger, my battle spells<br/>
      aren&#39;t all that great and I snare constantly.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have an effective snarer in your group, please do not use chain, it<br/>
      really pisses us off to see the monster we so diligently snared go running<br/>
      off. If you have an ineffective snarer, chide them about it. It&#39;s one of<br/>
      the most useful spells in the game.</div>
