&gt; Do any of our great bards out there have some good ideas for dungeon<br/>
&gt; crawling for a 20th going on 21st level bard?  I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>
&gt; outdoors, and can make money pretty fast now if I need to, so I&#39;m more<br/>
&gt; interested in going somewhere that might have interesting loot items.  I<br/>
&gt; have considered Solusek&#39;s Eye but not sure if I am high enough to do well<br/>
&gt; there.  Any other suggestions?  I can solo high blues even I have found<br/>
&gt; since I reached 20th, but prefer to group.  Would there be groups in Sol A<br/>
&gt; that would be the right levels for me?<br/>

quite that early, but the goblins at the entrance were green to me when<br/>
<br/>
However, if you haven&#39;t got a regular group yet, none of these dungeons<br/>
is likely to be all that useful. The best place I found on my server to<br/>
find pick up groups, where I eventually met people I ended up grouping<br/>
with into the late 40&#39;s was Unrest. <br/>
