<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043463200">This usually happens after you had a Packet Loss spike while you were <br/>
playing a song.  You would see your PL goes up to 30% and back down to 0 and <br/>
your song would be stuck.  You don&#39;t need a missed note to fix it, just keep <br/>
spamming one of your song (Selo works for me) really really fast.  It is <br/>
very difficult to do it with mouse clicking.. so you will have to use the <br/>
hotkeys.  I can unstuck my song everytime within a second or 2.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, your songs will also stuck when your DE mask illusion effect wears off, <br/>
or someone casted wolf form on you, or wolf form wears off, or any other <br/>
effect that changes your apparence while you are playing a song.  You can <br/>
fix any of those by spamming your song.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 7) Fix that bug that only I seem to get once in a while where my songs<br/>
&gt; &gt;    get stuck on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Had this happen to me the other night.  I finally decided to run for the<br/>
&gt;nearest zone to clear it and while I was doing that, I spammed out the<br/>
&gt;hotkey I have for Selos and it finally gave me a &#39;missed note&#39; message and<br/>
&gt;went back to being normal--just as I hit the zone. Doh!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Next time it happens, I plan on spamming out one of my higher level songs<br/>
&gt;(since I get a higher missed note response on them) until it clears<br/>
&gt;instead of just trying to zone.<br/>
