&gt; I don&#39;t know either.  I broke a level last night and several skills were going<br/>
&gt; up and I didn&#39;t see any difference in the messages being printed.  &quot;You have<br/>
&gt; become better at percussion and now pass other players even more quickly using<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s Accelerando (84).&quot;  I expected (84/200) or something.  So I switched to<br/>
&gt; the Skills screen hoping that instead of &quot;Feeble&quot; my fishing would be shown as<br/>
&gt; &quot;Feeble 12/200&quot;, but nope...  Anyone know where they hid the one thing that<br/>
&gt; they *did* document?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Typically, the stuff they do document doesn&#39;t often work. Such as the<br/>
invisibility flashing before it wears off as they documented in the last<br/>
patch. Perhaps that&#39;s the case here.<br/>
