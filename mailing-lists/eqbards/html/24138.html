&gt;that makes it easy for us to get into groups - especially given the small<br/>
&gt;number of bards in general.  The Druids and Rangers in my guild get<br/>
&gt;frustrated at how much more difficult it is for them to get in groups in,<br/>
&gt;say Karnor - while I get often get tells asking me if I&#39;m a group (even when<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have LFG flag on).<br/>
&gt;Arguing semantically even further - I could argue you have made not a single<br/>
&gt;argument towards power - only versatility - but that would pretty much be<br/>
&gt;arguing for arguing sake - I think you DO make a good arugment that bards<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t underpowered and are consistently powerful vis-├á-vis other classes.<br/>
&gt;On the other hand, I have yet to see an effective argument by you or anyone<br/>
&gt;else that bards are &quot;Over&quot; Powered.  To be &quot;Over Powered&quot; would imply that<br/>
&gt;the class needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot;.  If we were overpowered - you would often<br/>
&gt;see people say &quot;we can&#39;t start this group until we have a bard&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt;this said about clerics, enchanters, even Shaman, but never Bards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>what i mean by &#39;&#39;power&#39;&#39; is how effective a character is, as a whole.  this includes in<br/>
a group and soloing, indoors and outdoors, big raids and experience groups, etc.<br/>
in the group setting for example, power would be how effective you make the group.<br/>
in other words, say you have a 5 person group, shaman, sk, druid, rogue, necro, around<br/>
level 55ish who could get to and handle the necrosis in sebilis fairly easily.  they may not<br/>
be able to handle the kitchen or commander/broog/pickler or crypt.  now add a class<br/>
to this group.  how many classes will now enable them to do kitchen or back disco or<br/>
crypt?  cleric possibly, enchanter maybe (due to the fact that if the enchanter gets resisted<br/>
he&#39;s probably dead), bard almost certainly (i&#39;m assuming a good bard who knows lament<br/>
pulling and is fairly good at crowd control), any other class probably not.  now admittedly<br/>
if you had a 5 person group consisting of cleric, enchanter, warrior, rogue, wizard, the<br/>
bard will not add as much effectiveness to the group, but what other class will?  i believe<br/>
that in the &#39;&#39;average&#39;&#39; group makeup (for exp hunting) we are add more effectivity to a<br/>
group than most if not all other classes.</div>
