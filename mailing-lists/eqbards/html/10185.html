<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902907529">I spent some time in Kerra Ridge in my teens, it was fun if a bit trainy (is <br/>
that a word?).  It could use a make over and and some itemization as well.  <br/>
Also I heard that The Hole is supposed to be a level 15-30 zone.<br/>

&gt;i agree kerra ridge has so much potential, but its just horrible, that zone<br/>
&gt;is just hilarious, some of my friends wanted a paw (damn druids)  and while<br/>
&gt;we were bored waiting for her to spawn, we would cause trains, just to<br/>
&gt;myself i looted 31 catpeople, and think about this, we&#39;re not aggro to <br/>
&gt;them,<br/>
&gt;but think about a level 18 group trying to reach mitty. They&#39;d get their<br/>
&gt;butts kicked so bad.  You pull one cat at lower level and the whole place<br/>
&gt;comes.  They need to fix aggro range or pathing or linkage or whatever it<br/>
&gt;is, this zone is just horrible right now, and yet its a very cool zone<br/>

&gt;gloves? i cant use the bracer as im a wood elf<br/>
