<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674574610">LOL!  I can see it now, &quot;Evulia closes her eyes, belts out a few tunes, and<br/>
slashes wildly at Evulia.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, if anyone gets alarmed by it I&#39;ll just tell them I play punk rock and<br/>
thought slashing myself before battle would be really hardcore!  /em Evulia<br/>
climbs up onto her groupmates shoulders and begins crowd surfing.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m just getting silly, and I REALLY should get some work done.  ;<br/>

I know a few people who include emotes in their assist keys.  Heres the<br/>
problem, if the assist fails (IE talk isn&#39;t hitting anything) they usally<br/>
end up emoting ME since if there target was blank, it has probably switched<br/>
to me when my song pulsed.<br/>
<br/>
So I get all these horrible emotes done to me :(<br/>
