<div id="ygrps-yiv-952245802">Hopefully someone has posted this to the FAC board.  They are a group that<br/>
actively fights First Amendment Abridgements pro bono.  I can&#39;t find the<br/>
link or I would post it myself.  Obviously Verant has never heard of Larry<br/>
Flynt or they probably would have taken a different course in this case.<br/>

Yea I&#39;m just starting to read some of this thread.  Its pretty crazy.  I am<br/>
not someone who really gets excited about much, but this really irks.<br/>
Enough so to consider action.  The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>
EQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>
should organize a protest this weekend.  I might even show up for this one<br/>
:-)<br/>
