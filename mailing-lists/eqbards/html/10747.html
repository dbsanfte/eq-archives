&gt; an off-hand remark to a lev 50 wiz who was killing them&quot; &quot;... he would kill<br/>
&gt; his grandmother if she conned blue or better to him...&quot; and he said: &quot;That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  bahahah...  that&#39;s rich, I&#39;m laughing.  Even though there is this<br/>
