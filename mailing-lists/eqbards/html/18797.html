<div id="ygrps-yiv-605695933">i think i have had the same experience.  i went from high 130s dex to under<br/>
high 100s, so i lost about 30 points.  i don&#39;t know if i am missing more<br/>
notes or if i  am just imagining it.  but i do often get pissed when i have<br/>
to hit a key 2 or 3 times to get a song going, that&#39;s when it is noticeable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I cannot say that it is for sure, but when I moved from being <br/>
&gt; a dex/chr<br/>
&gt; bard to a more focussed AC bard, I noticed significant <br/>
&gt; amounts of missed<br/>
&gt; notes than before.  Mind you when I gained 25 AC, I lost about 20-30<br/>
&gt; points of Dex so the drop was pretty significant.  Prior to <br/>
&gt; the change I<br/>
&gt; was in the area of about 140 dex and now I have 107.<br/>
