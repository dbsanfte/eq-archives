&gt; I think I can help corroborate the theory that a flute boosts Charismatic<br/>
&gt; Carillion&#39;s effect (at least slightly).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; example:<br/>
&gt; About a month ago I spent most of a week helping my roommate&#39;s barbarian<br/>
&gt; warrior repeat the Langseax quest to get him a Langseax of the Wolves.  I<br/>
&gt; was 29th level at the time and I&#39;m pretty sure my wind skill was maxed, if<br/>
&gt; that matters.  My base faction with the Wolves of the North was <br/>
&gt; indifferent.  I Carillion&#39;ed Renth before I gave him my first Basil head<br/>
&gt; and it bumped my faction up to amiable.  Gave him the head and got &quot;Run<br/>
&gt; while you can... blah blah&quot;, faction still wasn&#39;t high enough to get the<br/>
&gt; langseax.  We go do the quest again and this time I Carillion Renth with<br/>
&gt; my flute.  It still only bumps my faction up to amiable, but this time he<br/>
&gt; gives me a langseax for the head.  On the next repeat of the quest I<br/>
&gt; forgot to use my flute with Carillion and he wouldn&#39;t give me the langseax<br/>
&gt; again.  We had to do the quest 20 times to get Paglan to spawn, by the<br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had occasions where using the song will not let me start<br/>
a quest, but using it with a flute will.  Also, the effect<br/>
seems to become greater as you level (raises you to a higher<br/>
faction).  Stuff that I could only take from dubious to<br/>
dubious now goes from dubious to apprehensive.<br/>
<br/>
I happened to run into Paglan while helping a friend chase<br/>
down the Ghoul Messenger.  Was mighty tempted to kill him, but<br/>
let him be since someone else had done all the work of<br/>
initiating the quest.  Hope they enjoyed their LotW.  :)<br/>
