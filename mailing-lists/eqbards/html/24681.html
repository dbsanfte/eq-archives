Gratz on the croaking dagger, I think that&#39;s the dagger Ihave. Supposedly it<br/>
is pretty rare. For haste item, I have a sash of dragonborne. It comes out<br/>
of Howling Stones South Tower. One decent group can get this and it&#39;s great<br/>
exp for +50&#39;s. It is a rare drop but you won&#39;t mind the wait while watching<br/>
your exp actually move!<br/>

Last night was yucky. We ported up to Air with the intentions of going to<br/>
the 4th Isle to finish the necro epic only to have IC port up on top of us.<br/>
They decided to roll to see who stayed and who left and we lost the roll!<br/>
