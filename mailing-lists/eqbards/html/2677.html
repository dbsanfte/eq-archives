<br/>
Verant was trying to make sure you didn&#39;t get both effects from Selo and<br/>
SoW.  But it appears they buchered the code.  They also realized that this<br/>
bug also caused Selo (and SoW) to cancel out Root.  I guess they figured it<br/>
evened out in the end and decided to make this bug a &quot;feature&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If Verant ever fixes this bug, you will probably lose the ability to<br/>
root-break too, since this was a side-effect of the bug and not something<br/>
planned.<br/>
<br/>
If you like it the way it is, then be happy.  If you want to lose the<br/>
root-break and SoW-cancel, then bug it.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Bard songs canceling spell effects, bug or feature?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When i found out selo&#39;s accelerando cancels a root i was pretty happy with<br/>
&gt;that unexpected feature. I was similarly pleased when i found out i can<br/>
&gt;charm a party member back into the group if he gets charmed. I was very<br/>
&gt;unhappy to find out however that levitate, underwater breathing, and<br/>
&gt;accelerando are over half the time useless in a group situation. All these<br/>
&gt;songs do nothing more than get everybody pissed at me because i just<br/>
&gt;canceled their sow or broke their journeyman boots. And Quellious help me<br/>
&gt;if i turn on levitate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These songs are rendered basically useless in a group setting because of<br/>
&gt;how they cancel their equivelent spell effects. So my question is, is this<br/>
&gt;a bug or a feature? I am torn between wanting to be able to cancel roots<br/>
&gt;and not cancel sow&#39;s. Ideally i would like to be able cancel roots and not<br/>
&gt;screw up a sow. Either way i would love to hear an official answer. The<br/>
&gt;whole spell stacking/canceling issue seems to still be fubard, for instance<br/>
&gt;i cant use the mask of the deciever to turn into a dark elf while a song is<br/>
&gt;playing. And if a song happens to be playing while the mask effect wears<br/>
&gt;off my songs lock up and i cant change or stop or start a song unless i<br/>
&gt;camp out. </span></blockquote></div>
