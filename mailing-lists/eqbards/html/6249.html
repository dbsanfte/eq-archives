&gt; P.S. to jhenders i finally got a ykesha last week to replace one of my wakis<br/>
&gt; =)  pretty close to dueling yaks cause the second hand doesn&#39;t proc as much<br/>
&gt; anyway and waki has same dmg/del ratio.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Woohoo. Congrats. Since I started a full time job again recently I<br/>
haven&#39;t been able to play long enough to be able to organise a party to<br/>
even try. Also, when I do log in, seems like most of my friends are<br/>
either playing second characters or out hunting lower level mobs to<br/>
twink said characters. Since the last fear plane nerfing the amount of<br/>
things for L50 chars to do is pretty dismal. I find this especially a<br/>
problem with our class. If I was a cleric I could at least wander around<br/>
and cast heals and buffs on random newbies when I was bored, but as<br/>
people need to be grouped to benefit from our songs there&#39;s really not<br/>
much we can do on that score.<br/>
