<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161535065">Heh, I&#39;m finding out that a safe spot in Mistmoore is just about as safe as<br/>
the &quot;Safe Spot&quot; in Fear ... but my favorite spot (and I&#39;m 21 fighting with 2<br/>
other 21s - admittedly pretty twinked) is on the other side of the tower<br/>
base at the bottom of the ramp.  If you hug that corner, the trains from the<br/>
castle to the zone won&#39;t get you.<br/>
<br/>
There are two or three spawns right there that can be pulled singly, as well<br/>
as any of the lake spawns (if they&#39;re not camped).  I still have yet to<br/>
figure out how to singly pull the little cavern to the graveyard (although<br/>
the druid harmony works ok as does my lull).  <br/>
<br/>
Also, after being terrified of using AE and aggroing the tower, I finally<br/>
tried it and I had no problems.  Anyway keep Selo&#39;s handy and your little<br/>
magic resist song cuz those casters suck.  <br/>

P.S. While playing twinks is fun, its pretty funny to watch someone with a<br/>
50th warrior play a 19th cleric as they get to two bubbles of health..and we<br/>
say: &quot;Run, run, no really run, we&#39;re leaving you, run run, ok bye&quot;.....<br/>
cleric dies. <br/>

Hunting I can&#39;t recommend any zone more than Sol a. I went from 26-33 in 3<br/>
weeks there.<br/>
<br/>
MM drums on tribunal are generally trade only (greedy caster bastards) but<br/>
the one person who was willing to sell was asking 3k p. Naturally I<br/>
declined.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m begining to explore the splendors of MM.<br/>

Hi, just visited MM for the first time on late Saturday night (prolly<br/>
the worst time, few ppl there, so I saw and died to several trains).  My<br/>
question is where can my group and I hunt there (I&#39;m 21, the group<br/>
ranges to 26) fairly safely?  (The idea is to be in the zone for a while<br/>
and /auction WTB MM drum.  Anyone have a clue what those would go for?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Really encouraging for a  first time visit (my group decided that<br/>
Unrest is safer then Cazic)<br/>
