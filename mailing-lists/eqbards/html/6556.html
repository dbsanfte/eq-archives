&gt; Enough ranting...those that got nailed on the box of Abu-Kar <br/>
&gt; are much worse<br/>
&gt; off considering the investment they made on it.  I wonder if <br/>
&gt; this was a ploy<br/>
&gt; to get all the people in the game with too much coin to blow <br/>
&gt; it on the box<br/>
&gt; only to have it devalued and then resold to the poor people <br/>
&gt; in the game at a<br/>
&gt; loss to help &quot;balance&quot; the economy?  Nahhhh, sounds like I am <br/>
&gt; heading down<br/>
&gt; conspiracy theory lane and will soon be seeing black <br/>
&gt; helicopters on the<br/>
&gt; horizon.<br/>
