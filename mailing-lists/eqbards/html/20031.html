<div id="ygrps-yiv-433827219">OK, my question:<br/>
<br/>
I won a staff in Chardok with some boring name that I can&#39;t quite <br/>
remember (Wood something Staff, something Wood Staff):  8/24 2hb MAG <br/>
only, unlimited charges of Cinder Bolt (~300DD?).  I gave it to a MAG in <br/>
my guild to &quot;borrow&quot;, but I&#39;m wondering what this is worth, ballpark <br/>
figures.  He seemed wildly ecstatic, so I have to think it&#39;s a darn good <br/>
item.<br/>
<br/>
I ask only because, aside from my two extra YKs, I have nada to trade.  <br/>
(Well, I have an Iksar mask and a Jade Mace, but I&#39;m not giving them up.) <br/>
At level 51 I still have no haste item, I have no resist gear to speak <br/>
of, and aside from the visible armor (Lambent/Imbrued/one Singing), my <br/>
other stuff is pretty mediocre.  What could I get for it?  What kind of <br/>
haste item do you all suggest I shoot for?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, some of you said that if I&#39;m happy with a trade I should go for it. <br/>
But I don&#39;t buy a car without checking alternatives and prices...<br/>

PS - The level 51 Binding Song is busted, too, right?  Yet another song <br/>
that my guild insists that I not play.  Sigh.  (Not that I necessarily <br/>
listen to them, mind you...)</div>
