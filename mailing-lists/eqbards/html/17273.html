<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435665899">I noticed with the new DOT messages that when my Obsidian Shard procs I get<br/>
a &quot;Your Obsidian Shatter has worn off&quot; or something like that about 10 ticks<br/>
after it procs.  I thought this weapon was just 30 DD with no DOT or debuff.<br/>
Does anyone know what the other part of the proc is?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, I have the option to start playing a friends&#39; account (who<br/>
is leaving EQ) who has a 35 lvl Pally.  Any advice on a class I&#39;ve never<br/>
played before?  I want to play with my other friends who are 50, 47, and 40<br/>
respectively, and I am concerned that I will never get my 19 Bard up there<br/>
quick enough.<br/>
<br/>
Also, by the way, this is by far the best EQ list I have subscribed to;  I<br/>
played a Necro since Day 1 of retail and put EQ up on the shelf for 6 months<br/>
after I got disenchanted with the class, the people playing my class, and<br/>
the game in general.  I also played a Cleric to 19 and simply didn&#39;t find<br/>
staring at my spell book all the time that appealing.  I &quot;rediscovered&quot; my<br/>
love for the game with my Bard and have been having the time of my life the<br/>
last month or so.  I am concerned that 1-19 was pretty easy (with some cash<br/>
and items from friends, :) ) but that 20-40 is gonna be pretty hard.  Any<br/>
thoughts on this?<br/>
<br/>
Eh, time to stop rambling.<br/>
