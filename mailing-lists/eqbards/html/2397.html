&gt; My problem is using programming internals to further my<br/>
&gt; ability to beat the computer program.  That&#39;s not the game<br/>
&gt; I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like disassembling code to<br/>
&gt; decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>
&gt; programs of my own, or getting playing hints by printing<br/>
&gt; out all the text messages from the software.  That&#39;s<br/>

&gt; /loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are a variety of mathematical coordinate transforms you<br/>
could do with the numbers /loc generates.  This would result<br/>
in the numbers still being useful for debugging since each<br/>
point would still have a unique value, and nearby points would<br/>
have similar values.  But it&#39;d be much less useful for<br/>
navigation, distance calculation, and mapping since it&#39;d no<br/>
longer be a grid (think of it as deforming the grid by pushing<br/>
and pulling parts of it out of shape).<br/>
<br/>
I still say that compasses need to give exact headings before<br/>
/loc is gimped.  Then they could add surveying equipment so we<br/>
diehard explorer/roleplayers could develop maps by surveying<br/>
and triangulating distances...  :-)<br/>
