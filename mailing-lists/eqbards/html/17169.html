<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240933263">The first bard I ever saw in combat was in lake<br/>
Rathe...she was a wood elf, 19th lvl and using the<br/>
classic all instrument attack to much better effect<br/>
than my 19th lvl druid could have done.<br/>
<br/>
She saved my life twice that morning and I was so<br/>
impressed with the way she played, I decided to make<br/>
up a bard too.<br/>
