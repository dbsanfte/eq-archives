<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 16MB, but the game is designed to run on a card with 4MB, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think this is the case.  Like I said, I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something about the mouse acceleration freaking out when one<br/>
&gt; &quot;instant&quot; the mouse is here, and the next &quot;instant&quot; (after the<br/>
&gt; hard drive and CPU have done the data transfer) the mouse is<br/>
&gt; all the way over there.  I don&#39;t have the problem when I turn<br/>
&gt; with the keyboard, but the turn rate doing that is much lower.<br/>
&gt; The problem is much less pronounced in glide mode.<br/>
