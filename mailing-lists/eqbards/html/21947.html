&gt;I think there&#39;s a heck of a lot of difference between an e-bay twink and<br/>
&gt;a character who&#39;s played to 50+ switching to another character. And<br/>
&gt;especially a bard, who&#39;s probably in the best position to watch how<br/>
&gt;other&#39;s play their characters. Assuming some intelligence in the<br/>
&gt;person involved, I&#39;d say the 2 harders characters to pick up would be<br/>
&gt;the cleric and the enchanter myself. I&#39;ve run across L50+ enchanters I<br/>
&gt;know played those entire 50+ levels themselves who still aren&#39;t very<br/>
&gt;good. At the same time, I&#39;ve played in guild groups with one of our<br/>
&gt;enchanter characters played by a cleric who was excellent.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would have to agree.  I think I can make a good effort at being an<br/>
enchanter since I&#39;ve been watching them at work for a long long time<br/>
and mostly wishing I, as a bard, could be even a fraction as<br/>
effective.  Now, as my sig suggests, I&#39;ve taken it seriously and<br/>
become an enchanter for real.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To introduce another possible discussion point, the most noticable thing<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed about enchanters I don&#39;t consider very good is that they<br/>
&gt;seem to stun less. The enchanters in my guild always seem to stun first,<br/>
&gt;sometimes twice, before going to mez. This seems to allow them to keep<br/>
&gt;way more mobs mezzed than other enchanters I&#39;ve played with. Anyone else<br/>
&gt;notice this? I have a rl friend on another server who has a 50+<br/>
&gt;enchanter who said she doesn&#39;t use stun much because she&#39;s paranoid of<br/>
&gt;the through walls and ceiling problems with AoE spells in dungeons. The<br/>
&gt;only time I&#39;ve seen this be a problem for our guild enchanters was on<br/>
&gt;the first isle of Sky where the AoE stun brought the quest mobs up from<br/>
&gt;inside the island (twice, we still don&#39;t let him forget that one). It<br/>
&gt;sure served to show how ingrained the stun first, mez later habit was<br/>
&gt;with him though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me the stun is extremely extremely extremely important.  In fact I<br/>
can&#39;t say that enough.  There are 2 key stuns for me as an enchanter<br/>
at level 20 and above ... colour flux (lvl 4 - 4 sec stun) and colour<br/>
shift (lvl 20 - 6 sec stun).  Colour skew (lvl 44 - 8 sec stun) is yet<br/>
another upgrade.  All are AOE.<br/>
<br/>
The key to mezzing when something is hitting you is to stun with the<br/>
very fast casting lvl 4 spell, then immediately cast the lvl 20 spell.<br/>
This then gives you enough time with everything about you stunned to<br/>
cast your mez spell off and you don&#39;t need to rely on channeling to<br/>
get through an interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
I actually found this to be very obvious and I&#39;m surprised more people<br/>
don&#39;t use it when I watch them.  A lot of enchanters I&#39;ve seen rely on<br/>
getting only the longer stun off, but I&#39;ve found it easier to do the<br/>
short one first, then the longer one, then mez.  The mana cost is just<br/>
insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough said ... this isn&#39;t an enchanter list after all =)<br/>
