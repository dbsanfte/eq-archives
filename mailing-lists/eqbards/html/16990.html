<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891763315">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Well, it seems our rogue needs a Ravenscale BP and some boots. So here I am<br/>
asking for advice camping the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve spent a ton of time in the courtyard and a decent amount of time<br/>
at 4C, top and bottom. I&#39;ve also been to the gator pools (green and blue)<br/>
and the throne room. Specifically I&#39;m curious what dangers to watch out for<br/>
(besides the avatar himself) and any advice in so far as what songs if any<br/>
are highly effective or ineffective. (party is rogue, druid, warrior, bard<br/>
and possibly enchanter and mage, all levels 30-35)<br/>
