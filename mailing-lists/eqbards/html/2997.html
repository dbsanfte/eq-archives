Lullaby or am fooling around with Discord.  Nearly all the<br/>
tanks I play with can outdamage me enough that they can pull<br/>
anything off me within a song or two.  I toss in Chain every<br/>
now and then to better distribute the damage (pulling the/a<br/>
mob off someone really getting beat up).  On average I&#39;d say I<br/>
go through about two rounds of twisting three songs before I&#39;m<br/>
stunned.  My connection is good enough that I can miss a note<br/>
or two and I still have enough time to keep three songs going.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or are you standing off with an instrument and playing for extra party<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll sometimes switch to a drum twisting Rhythm songs if we&#39;re<br/>
up against a really nasty magical mob, especially if it can<br/>
charm.  It really depends on the makeup of the group.  If<br/>
there are plenty of tanks, you can back off and act sort of<br/>
like a caster with enhanced buffs and heals.  If you are the<br/>
only tank, or one of two, then you&#39;re probably going to be<br/>
interrupted frequently enough that melee is more effective.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it ever help to equip lute for hp if you are getting hit on by strong<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends. :-)  If your party has multiple mobs hitting you,<br/>
then the damage you as a group are taking will far exceed what<br/>
you can heal, and you&#39;re better off killing the mobs ASAP.<br/>
Once the rate they&#39;re damaging you starts to approach your<br/>
healing rate, then it makes more sense to twist in healing. It<br/>
can make sense to equip a lute in a fight to heal, but usually<br/>
only if your group is all pretty badly hurt and you are<br/>
basically mopping up.  Otherwise, healing during a fight is<br/>
basically slowing down the rate you&#39;re dying at and<br/>
lengthening the fight as a tradeoff.  (Wish I could draw this<br/>
- it&#39;s much easier to explain graphically.)<br/>
