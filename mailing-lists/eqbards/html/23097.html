&gt;well, keep trying to talk the group into bagging one on our way into Howling<br/>
&gt;Stones but they&#39;ve been in a rush to get in everytime so far. I never log in<br/>
&gt;and hang out, consequently I have a bank full of old armor and dropped<br/>
&gt;spells and assorted stuff that could be sold or traded. If I don&#39;t log the<br/>
&gt;bard in expressly to go do something, we go play twinks or move stuff<br/>
&gt;between characters and then go do something. (4 accounts between the 2 of<br/>
&gt;us, now that&#39;s addiction!)<br/>

I did get a SOW off of someone, invis&#39;d myself, found a Scrouger and DOT&#39;d <br/>
him. Reinvis&#39;d myself and had him follow me out of the chasm. He will DT <br/>
you, and that happened to be when I was passing another scorpion, but that <br/>
actually made it easier as then I just charm-kited once I got them both out <br/>
of the Chasm.<br/>
