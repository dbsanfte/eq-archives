I soloed in EW thru my late 40s.  Charm kiting is really the way to go there.  Once your pet is worn down, chant it to death.  Yes it gets easier once you have chant of flame but the xp is great.  fear kiting ulthorks and doing the tusk quest in CS is also an option.  Coldain villages offer the best charm kiting in my opinion -- simply because you have less risk of adds.  If you are on dorf faction tho you might consider the giant fort instead.  Once you get chant of flame, chant kiting becomes an option.  I have to agree that SoW potions give you a much easier time.  By the time you get your third chant, you&#39;ll be able to kite snow griffins while running backwards (SoW potions don&#39;t really give you enough speed for this so you should either mem anti magic aria to stop griffin-SoW or chain them if you use potions for speed -- Griffs are a good money maker because there are always those trying to do ring quests who need a no drop egg from them and either can&#39;t track or get a group to help them )<br/>

I want to be versatile and be able to do all the class can do (which in our <br/>
case is a whole lot)... so..<br/>
<br/>
Am currently 37, was going to wait to solo until I got chant of <br/>
flame...  but maybe I can get 38 in EW?<br/>
<br/>
I have MM drums and decent equipment, but nothing outrageous.<br/>
<br/>
What do you solo there and what techniques, I&#39;m very veyr interested.  My <br/>
wife&#39;s sick to death of OT and is going to drag her warrior over to velious <br/>
soon, so thought this would be very pertinent info for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time,<br/>
