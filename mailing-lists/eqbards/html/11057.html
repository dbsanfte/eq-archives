<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711409289"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;LOL, how do you know who our characters know? =) Please don&#39;t ASSume such<br/>
&gt;things. Mine come from the same town, it&#39;s highly likely they know <br/>
&gt;eachother<br/>
&gt;and may even be related!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Currently the facts are there is not much to do for lvl 50&#39;s on a server<br/>
&gt;crowded with high levels so twinking is going to happen. Until Verant gets<br/>
&gt;off their asses and stops nerfing the freakin game, and does something <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;it that&#39;s the way it&#39;s gonna be. There are many things we could do, but you<br/>
&gt;know what - on my server almost EVERY night those many things we could do<br/>
&gt;are already being done by someone else. 80 people in Lower Guk average, 60<br/>
&gt;people in Sol B, usually at least a group doing Kedge, and it&#39;s hard to get<br/>
&gt;the right people together for a planes raid so when those raids happen they<br/>
&gt;happen. Dragons pop once a week, FG&#39;s pop every 8 hours - BOTH life spans<br/>
&gt;are a couple hours at most (no lie). We complain to Verant, and what do <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;do? They add a bunch of rediculously high level mobs to Kith, screwing all<br/>
&gt;the low level travellers. Now you tell me what else is there to do. Please<br/>
&gt;tell me now - thx info! Trust me, I have tried and tried lately to find<br/>
&gt;something xp-gaining for Sart to do with NO luck. Maybe if Paw doesn&#39;t suck<br/>
&gt;it may help a LITTLE, but it is not a very large place (comparatively).<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll see how that turns out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ph34r my bad grammar! =P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My druid is now level 44, and more and more I am seeing/hearing the same <br/>
thing, &quot;There is nothing to do for high levels&quot;  Granted, she hasn&#39;t hit 50 <br/>
yet, but at this point, I doubt she will.  Most places that give her <br/>
experience are over crowded and camped.  It&#39;s gotten so bad on Povar, that <br/>
good races are camping the dwarf NPC&#39;s in Butcherblock.  Gate into BB and <br/>
the first thing you hear is, &quot;Anyone camping Den?&quot;  I guess if thats what <br/>
floats your boat, go for it, but personally, I prefer to gain my experience <br/>
in a roleplaying method, and killing good race NPC&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit with that.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my druid&#39;s group have left EQ.  After adventuring with them for <br/>
30-odd levels, she is now alone.  This doesnt particularly bother me since <br/>
I&#39;ve taken to playing my bard more, and am having a great time with her.<br/>
<br/>
Still and all, I wish Verant would have given a little more forethought to <br/>
what would happen down the road to the high end players.  I suspect many <br/>
more ppl will leave the game in the coming months.<br/>
