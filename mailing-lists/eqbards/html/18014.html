<div id="ygrps-yiv-366697327">The former.  While some people have suggested your level is a factor in how<br/>
Clouding works - I don&#39;t believe Wind Level is a factor (beyond missed notes<br/>
on starting the song if the Wind Level is very low)<br/>

&gt; So my question is this, was something in the king&#39;s room casting see<br/>
invis,<br/>
&gt; or did those skill increases in wind get me to the point where I was invis<br/>
&gt; to more things?  If the second is the case, I would recommend that you try<br/>
&gt; to max that wind skill if you&#39;re having problems with not being invis to<br/>
&gt; certain mobs.<br/>
