<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134437561">Hmm, ok, here are a few sugestions for you<br/>
pettition....<br/>
<br/>
Chick Stuff<br/>
I&#39;d like to some one fix the fact that female pc&#39;s<br/>
have more stuff given to them.  I&#39;ve been travling<br/>
with a lady wizzie friend since 5, and every week she<br/>
has a story about some new item she got super cheap or<br/>
next to nothing.  I&#39;m 24 now, and the only thing I<br/>
ever had given to me were banded sleaves. <br/>
<br/>
Neural Sensors<br/>
The game needs to be able to tell when I&#39;m asleep at<br/>
the keyboard so it can notify my party that keeps<br/>
trying to defend me.<br/>
<br/>
Alpha Loot<br/>
How many times have I been in a party of Aeric, Ariel,<br/>
Aalamondi, Ashley and Almar and heard, &quot;Well guys, I<br/>
got my super cool item, boy am I tired now, see you<br/>
guys later&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Idiot Flag<br/>
Some sort of warning for clerics who melee and<br/>
repulse, but never heal, mages who burn early that you<br/>
spend the rest of the battle trying to pull mobs off,<br/>
and neurotic pullers who insist &quot;30% mana is fine, now<br/>
where was that level 30 evil eye?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
RL sex flag<br/>
To ID people role playing other sexes.  I say this<br/>
because my guild already had it&#39;s version of the<br/>
crying game, ewwwwww<br/>
