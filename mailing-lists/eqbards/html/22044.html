Drop the hardware acceleration down one notch<br/>

This should do the trick<br/>

&gt; &gt;I recently got a new PC.  It IS like playing a totally new <br/>
&gt; game now and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was finally able to twist 4 songs.  :)  But one of the <br/>
&gt; changes I noticed<br/>
&gt; &gt;with this PC is for the worse.  Actually two changes are, <br/>
&gt; but I think I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;live with the fact that everywhere I go I hear women screaming, bears<br/>
&gt; &gt;roaring, wisps whizzing, etc.  I guess that&#39;s supposed to <br/>
&gt; make you feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;like you&#39;re in a zone full of dead bodies and monsters.  Bit <br/>
&gt; nerve racking<br/>
&gt; &gt;though, and I can no longer track by ear.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But anyway, that&#39;s the problem I can learn to live with.  <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s killing me<br/>
&gt; &gt;now is, I THINK, lag.   See, lag spikes on my old PC <br/>
&gt; basically just made<br/>
&gt; &gt;movements slow and choppy.  What&#39;s happening now is my <br/>
&gt; screen completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;locks up for about 20 seconds, during that time I&#39;ll hear <br/>
&gt; about 5 seconds<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the me piercing something repeatedly, followed by 5ish <br/>
&gt; seconds of me<br/>
&gt; &gt;screaming in agony repeatedly, followed by 5 seconds of the mob<br/>
&gt; &gt;barking/growling/etc, and so on.  It&#39;s like the client is <br/>
&gt; playing all the<br/>
&gt; &gt;sound effects of the battle in order of effect rather than <br/>
&gt; chronological.<br/>
&gt; &gt;And I can do NOTHING while this is going on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I tried going back to all my old PCs settings (no particles, <br/>
&gt; about a 15&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;clip plane, most chatting off, etc) but if it helped any, it <br/>
&gt; only made<br/>
&gt; &gt;these lag spikes less frequent.  It didn&#39;t make them any <br/>
&gt; more manageable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh and I&#39;m calling these lag spikes for lack of a better explanation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Since the screen stops updating for such a long time I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know what the<br/>
&gt; &gt;status bar would be showing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyone have any insight on this?  Is this what lag is <br/>
&gt; &quot;supposed&quot; to look<br/>
&gt; &gt;like?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My new PC is a 1GHz P3, with 128 RAM & 64 video RAM.  (Nice <br/>
&gt; toy, eh?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought so &lt;g&gt;) Old PC, if I recall correctly, was a 200Mhz <br/>
&gt; P2, with 64 RAM<br/>
&gt; &gt;& 32 video RAM.  Both use 56K modems.<br/>

&gt; &gt;On an unrelated note, Talies, sorry to hear your out of the <br/>
&gt; game, glad to<br/>
&gt; &gt;hear your staying with the list.<br/>

&gt; &gt;And on another unrelated note, Thex, how&#39;d the Naggy raid go <br/>
&gt; last night?<br/>
