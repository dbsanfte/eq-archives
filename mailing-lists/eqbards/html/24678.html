<b>Subject:</b> dueling a druid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-481490736">In preparation for this weeks guild event: duelmania, I got silly and dueled my wife last night.  She is a 40th lvl druid and I am at 41.<br/>
I was curious about how my songs would work -- here&#39;s what I discovered:<br/>
<br/>
Multiflorious motion dispels root every time.<br/>
Denon&#39;s dissention does work, but not well enough to use in a duel <br/>
(**There is a potential psych factor tho -- maybe combining it with an &quot;emote /e drains mana from %T&quot; and /cast &lt;song #&gt; would work...)<br/>
Fear is resisted alot and pixie strike too -- my wife&#39;s MR is 57.<br/>
anti magic aria is a great song<br/>
chains is a great song, in spite of numerous resists (great psych factor)<br/>
Never dismiss the effectiveness of guardian rhythms and a drum<br/>
Bellow is a great song<br/>
punching interrupts casting<br/>
<br/>
Best overall tactic of the night turned out to be:<br/>
<br/>
drums equipped, twist GR, chains and anti-magic aria to debuff (she had 9 buffs up for each of our 11 duels...)<br/>
(Most druid spells bounce with MR over 120 but DRONES OF DOOM usually landed and was difficult to for me to dispel.)<br/>
Once chained, I was able to punch and interrupt spells<br/>
Once damage shields and most buffs are off, druid is also LOM by this time<br/>
Equip weapons and commence to thrash.<br/>
<br/>
 Note <br/>
<br/>
Dispelling DOTs can be a real pain with targeting, singing, retargeting, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend setting up a social key:<br/>
<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/target &lt;yourname&gt;<br/>
/cast &lt;song number&gt;<br/>
/target &lt;opponent´┐¢s name&gt; <br/>
The nice thing about this social is your opponent is very quickly retargeted so you can immediately resume punching/dismembering them.<br/>
