&gt; Some kind of geek code is my guess.  I know how to recognize it, but<br/>
&gt; never took the time to decipher it.  Seems to be standard in<br/>

I post a lot in alt.games.everquest, also the rpg and strategy game news<br/>
groups. Back when I worked at an isp I was quite active in news.admin.*<br/>
and some other comp.* groups but lately most of the areas I&#39;m interested<br/>
in are better served by mailing lists.<br/>
<br/>
The geek code now has a web page, www.geekcode.com. I&#39;m not sure how my<br/>
sig translates now as I made it up back around version 1.0 and the code<br/>
is appearantly up to 4.0 now. The Artificial Intelligence thing I made<br/>
up but I&#39;ve since been told there&#39;s a very similar one on a wall at MIT<br/>
somewhere. I had the &quot;they keep making better idiots&quot; phrase in mind<br/>
when I made up mine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic a bit, I finally went back and played my bard on my old<br/>
server last night after having burned out on playing for quite a while.<br/>
It was rather fun. A RL friend I had introduced to the game finally was<br/>
L52 so we could actually play together. He and I teamed up with a L40<br/>
druid and went hunting ice giants. As I&#39;d read that the chants finally<br/>
did different damage we tried an all instrument attack. The druid snared<br/>
and dotted, I wove fear, chant of flame and fufil&#39;s with a MM Drum and<br/>
my friend used a lute and played fear, CoD and CoC. We also had a L36<br/>
warrior with us who beat on the giant&#39;s back. The giants went down quite<br/>
quickly. In a couple hours play I&#39;d got a quarter bubble at 49 and the<br/>
warrior had got over a bubble in 36. Looks like I may play my bard more<br/>
for a while, as I&#39;m definately tired of 53 with my druid.<br/>
