&gt; &gt; Greetings Arch Mage,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a question regarding the Bard song Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I now many Bards and non-Bards the say this song increases mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; regeneration.  I now just as many Bards that say it does not.  A while<br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt; &gt; a poster named J.M. Capozzi posted to the EQBards OneList mailing list<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he had spoken to someone at Verant that told him it did not increase <br/>
&gt;mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; regeneration.  If you could lay this Urban Myth to rest one way or <br/>
&gt;another<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Bard community would be very grateful.<br/>

&gt;I know what everyone has said on this subject of the Jig not helping mana<br/>
&gt;and I have done my own tests. My exgirlfriend has a highelf enchanter and <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;tested that rumor out. I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she had <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;total bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>
&gt;self till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>
&gt;meditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at lvl <br/>
&gt;18<br/>
&gt;with her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this time<br/>
&gt;i sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>
&gt;13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My theory<br/>
&gt;is the reason why it helps slightly is because when you are sing the Jig <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;dont consume food or drink. so perhaps the programming has taken the time <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;would take for it to do checks on wheather you ear and drink or not and<br/>
&gt;applied that to the meditating process. Frankly whether it helps or not. I<br/>
&gt;sing it anyways during spell caster down times. It is the song i use with<br/>
&gt;most of my Bad Poems has almost become a tradition in my guild that when i<br/>
&gt;am singing that song i am telling a bad joke or poem.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I had the exact same experience a couple of weeks ago - also in<br/>
&gt;Highkeep!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (You play on Xegony server?) had two other bards in the group.  <br/>
&gt;Neither<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;twisted&quot; at all - they just each kept one song going the whole time.<br/>
&gt;One<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing Hymn the other doing Jig.  I don&#39;t think they even bellowed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I got into a major argument with one of the bards about the Jig thing.<br/>
&gt;It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was funny that laughed off &quot;the old rumor that Jig DOESN&#39;T increase <br/>
&gt;mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recovery&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The interesting thing about it - one of my best bud&#39;s and guildmates - <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric - felt that it WAS helping him.  This is a VERY knowledgeable<br/>
&gt; &gt; player.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I explained to him the &quot;apparent speed&quot; issue - and he still felt it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; increased mana recovery.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The thing to keep in mind about my bud - he lives in a remote part of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wisconsin - has TERRIBLE connectivity - goes linkdead constantly.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; ALWAYS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has bad PL/ping.  So I suspect that in the case of these people bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; connectivity - the jig song actually may help.   Jig may essentially<br/>
&gt;force<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more frequent server updates.  For those of us lucky enough to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; broadband access - or clean dialups - more frequent server updates <br/>
&gt;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; difference - so we KNOW jig doesn&#39;t help.  But perhaps for the others <br/>
&gt;-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it negates the lag caused by the bad connectivity?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just one bard&#39;s theory here..<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then <br/>
&gt;after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level <br/>
&gt;32<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she <br/>
&gt;said<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I <br/>
&gt;ran<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot;<br/>
&gt;(I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should make a hotkey for that :). Can&#39;t Verant just put a note in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; news confirming and denying some basic rumors like this and the 6<br/>
&gt;person<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; XP bonus? Would make our lives easier :)<br/>
