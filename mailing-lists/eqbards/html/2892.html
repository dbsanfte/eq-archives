<div id="ygrps-yiv-346395800">No, it&#39;s not the level, because I was level 20 when I did the quest.  It<br/>
sounds like it&#39;s random.  OR, if you did the quest before they started<br/>
boosting the rewards, that could explain it.<br/>
<br/>
I tried luring the deputy away with critters.... he&#39;ll graciously attack<br/>
anything you bring near... I started a train (hard to do cause I almost kill<br/>
the little crap with 1 swing, hehe) and lured him away.  He got back before<br/>
I could run back, up the ladder and hit Bronin.  I&#39;ll try it with help<br/>
luring him away, and I&#39;ll wait upstairs and hit him.  I&#39;ve been jumping off<br/>
the tower to try and get away from the Deputy and guards.  Also, the first<br/>
time I did it, nobody else helped.  Was just me and Bronin.  The second<br/>
time, I was being hit by Bronin, 2 other weasels, and the Deputy.... Guess<br/>
this is definately group strategy time.  My &quot;Reputation&quot; which preceded<br/>
&quot;Slaythe&quot; to the captain musta been wrong.  : )<br/>

&gt;You don&#39;t, you need to attack the little thug with several PC&#39;s and just<br/>
&gt;sacrifice one of them (you) to the Deputy&#39;s wrath. An alternative is to<br/>
&gt;attack mister deputy yourself, then run his little butt across the entire<br/>
&gt;zone. You zone, he starts trudging back, you zone back and speedrun past<br/>
&gt;him to the now alone thug. (Good roleplay there huh? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t believe you got a Dwarven Axe for this. I was maybe too high level<br/>
&gt;when I did it (17th?) but I remember being really surprised as to how<br/>
&gt;especially crap the reward was. Literally something like 3 sp&#39;s.<br/>
