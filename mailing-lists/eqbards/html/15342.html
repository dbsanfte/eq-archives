<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884966883">So by &quot;GAME OVER&quot; did he mean he was retiring his bard and/or quitting EQ<br/>
altogether?  If so then I say don&#39;t let the door hit you on the ass on the<br/>
way out.  To roll for and loot a magic item like that only to &quot;complete your<br/>
set&quot; and then retire your character is an example of EQ greediness at its<br/>
worst.  If he had no intention of ever using the weapon, he should have let<br/>
someone loot who could have actually used it.  <br/>

&gt; to another bard with a lot more Planar experience than I have.  He now has<br/>
&gt; the whole set of weapons and Imbrued.  In his words &quot;It took 10 months,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; GAME OVER&quot;.<br/>
