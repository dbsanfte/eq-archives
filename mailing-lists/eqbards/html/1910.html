enough that it goes off several times in succession.  Last<br/>
night with a dirk (delay 23, primary) and whip (delay 28,<br/>
secondary) equipped, I watched it go off 4 times in<br/>
succession.  The messages went:<br/>
<br/>
whip<br/>
dirk<br/>
 [pause]<br/>
dirk<br/>
whip<br/>
 [pause]<br/>
dirk<br/>
 [pause]<br/>
whip<br/>
 [pause]<br/>
dirk<br/>
 [pause]<br/>
dirk<br/>
whip<br/>
<br/>
So the two swing independent of each other, each at their own<br/>
delay.  The minotaur axe and combine longsword have very<br/>
similar damage/delay ratios.  I wouldn&#39;t fret over which one<br/>
you have equipped in your primary hand.  I would think you&#39;d<br/>
want the combine in your primary so you don&#39;t have to switch<br/>
weapons if you run into a magic-only mob.<br/>
