&gt; I haven&#39;t kept track of how much the tap is taking per cast, but with<br/>
&gt; resistances I&#39;ve never saved completely outright.  My tactic over this<br/>
&gt; weekend for the two fights we had against him were to weave verses and<br/>
&gt; niv&#39;s, I had trouble adding a third with the number of people there.<br/>

proper song - you should have the enchanters/shaman speed buff<br/>
everyone ahead of time.  Against mobs that do dispel and where<br/>
time is critical (Innoruk/Cazic, and to a lesser extent the<br/>
dragons), I&#39;m still undecided as to which is better - healing,<br/>
resists, or attack speedups.<br/>
