<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764273321">Well Steve, it really depends on what you&#39;re looking for.  There are<br/>
slightly diminishing returns on stats above 100, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>
surpassing 100 on any given stat.  I would recommend putting an extra 5<br/>
points into agility, just to bring it to 100 (that is for a Wood Elf).  Then<br/>
the rest are up to you.  I brought my Str up to 80, since wearing plate is a<br/>
good thing as a bard, though some might argue that you should put points<br/>
into charisma so that the songs you sing have stronger effect.  I&#39;ve not<br/>
witnessed any change when I have my enchanter friend buff me with<br/>
Sympathetic Aura, so I&#39;d say the added effect is slight.  Dex is nice so you<br/>
can twist songs with greater ease.  Nothing is more embarrassing for a bard<br/>
than a frog in the throat.  As a wood elf, your Stamina is fairly low,<br/>
around 65 starting I believe, and I find that since i kept my stamina low I<br/>
tend to run out of it almost after every fight.  Songs drain stamina quite a<br/>
bit.  It will also help to curb the naturally low HP of a bard.  So you can<br/>
see many stats are useful for a bard, follow your heart and you&#39;ll do fine.<br/>

Okay, I&#39;m new to this list....<br/>
<br/>
I want to start a new Bard. It looks like the Wood Elf is the best race for<br/>
a bard. My question is, how should I spend my 25pts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info,<br/>
<br/>
