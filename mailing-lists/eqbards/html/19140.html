<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076528007">Hello all my first post.<br/>
Abashi started that post himself asking for &quot;OUR&quot;<br/>
opinions.  I can&#39;t bring myself to blame him for<br/>
not knowing the Clouding wouldn&#39;t twist, really.<br/>
I think what is most important is that HE asked<br/>
for OUR opinion.  The first few posts I read were civil.<br/>
I really think we should remember He was asking &quot;US&quot;.<br/>

I don&#39;t doubt that he&#39;s a nice guy and knows his own class inside out and I<br/>
have a lot of respect for him for putting up with the flak from disgruntled<br/>
players daily.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m with Galtin on this one.  Before tossing some ideas into the<br/>
lion&#39;s den, he should have checked with the spell gurus or at least someone<br/>
in-house that plays a Bard. It sounds like he even spoke with GZ about it.<br/>
<br/>
If he did check, it&#39;s safe to assume the spell guys don&#39;t know how some Bard<br/>
songs interact with each other and/or they don&#39;t have a Bard of sufficient<br/>
level in-house to verify that twisting Invis with anything else doesn&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
