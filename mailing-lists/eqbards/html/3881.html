Depends on the spellcaster.  Wizards are bad, I try to avoid<br/>
them even if they&#39;re green.  The others are usually not too<br/>
bad, but fights against them tend to be very unpredictable,<br/>
depending on what spells they cast and whether or not you<br/>
resist.  Half the time I have to run, half the time I kill<br/>
them barely losing a bubble.<br/>
<br/>
White/black/yellow/red grunts can be kited if you&#39;re so<br/>
inclined.  The only ones I fear are the ones with really long<br/>
stuns (the Knight of Unrest has this).  The rest I can run<br/>
away from if need be.<br/>
<br/>
Green trains are not a problem.  Lullaby and Screech let you<br/>
control them, Discord and Dissonance let you kill them.<br/>
