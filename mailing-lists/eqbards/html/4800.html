<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122542619">I can&#39;t speak for DSL, but I have a cable modem, which I believe is faster<br/>
than DSL, and here is what I&#39;ve experienced.<br/>
<br/>
	I just signed up for DSL Access and hopefully will have 1.024 MBs<br/>
accessin about five weeks.  Two questions<br/>
<br/>
	1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be<br/>
lessof an issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>
<br/>
With a cable modem, I still experience tremendous lag at some points.  Most<br/>
recently, I have been in Unrest playing in non-peak hours  (I live in Hawaii<br/>
so when I play at night its after midnight on the mainland).  Most of the<br/>
time there are only around 20 people in the one.  Even with that low number<br/>
of people, lag still hits during the peak of battle.  I am starting to<br/>
believe lag is more a function of the zone you are in versus your connection<br/>
speed.  Other people I am grouped with all seem to experience lag at the<br/>
same time I do, and they have regular modem connections.  In other zones<br/>
this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.  I was adventuring in the Karanas and<br/>
Beholder all last week and I never had any lag problems.  In regards to<br/>
zoning times, the amount of RAM you have makes a big difference.  I upgraded<br/>
from 64MB to 128MB of RAM and it makes a world of difference.  I can follow<br/>
people into a one and get to the other side 30 seconds before they arrive.<br/>
<br/>
	2) The service I&#39;ve signed up for eventually will charge $20/GB<br/>
upstream after the first GB (i.e. the first Gigabyte is free) any idea how<br/>
much data EQ is pumping upstream?<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t help you here.  <br/>
