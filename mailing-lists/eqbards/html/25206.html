<div id="ygrps-yiv-974809345">I don&#39;t have Tboots, I have Jboots, but for my purposes they&#39;re comparable, and I find them quite useful.<br/>
I use them to enter areas where Selo&#39;s isn&#39;t good (dungeons, for example), as well as to DOT kite.  It<br/>
makes kiting a lot faster - you don&#39;t have to twist in Selo&#39;s.  Plus, if you aren&#39;t in a real hurry to get<br/>
somewhere (because the rest of your group is coming from other places and will be awhile), you can sing<br/>
other stuff instead and still run fast enough to stay out of danger, for the most part.<br/>
