&gt; So, how encumbered do you generally find yourself? What&#39;s your natural<br/>
&gt; strength before magic items? I&#39;m wondering if 90 strength would be a safe<br/>
&gt; amount, when planning to wear bronze and steel plate down the road.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think 90 would be a bit low, you won&#39;t be hauling around too much loot<br/>
until you have a fair number of strength enhancing items and/or a weight<br/>
reducing bag. And the big problem here is hauling stuff around is a lot<br/>
more of an issue at lower levels when you need money the most and the<br/>
good strength enhancing items are out of your reach. I was still wearing<br/>
a spiked collar at L30 for the extra +3 str it gave me and my half elf<br/>
bard has a base strenth of 98. At later levels loot and money become way<br/>
less of an issue unless you are trying to train the jewelry skill, so<br/>
most people end up leaving those fine steel morning stars lying on the<br/>
ground rather than carrying them, and dumping excess copper when their<br/>
weight creeps up too much. As I usually find I&#39;m still dumping 40-60pp<br/>
in the bank every couple of days and don&#39;t really have much I can spend<br/>
it on anyway this really isnt much of a problem. Dispite the fact that<br/>
you can carry some weight over your max encumberence without it visibly<br/>
degrading your stats, I still try to stay below encumberance just<br/>
because I find the constant messages as anthem (or now berserker&#39;s)<br/>
wears off to be too annoying to put up with.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people like the Wood Elf for their easy access to bronze plate<br/>
at lower levels (not to mention the ability to wear a Crush tunic, which<br/>
I&#39;ve always been amazed fit an Orc three times the size of my Half Elf<br/>
but wouldn&#39;t fit my Half Elf) but personally I prefered the Half Elf, as<br/>
much for the stats but as for not having to start in Greater Faydark<br/>
(despite having the goofiest looking plate helm in the game - ok maybe<br/>
we tie with humans on that. :)<br/>
