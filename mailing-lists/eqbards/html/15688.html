<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554295708">Yes, I have tried to lower the hardware accel, that was the first thing they<br/>
suggested.  No effect.  I have tried every setting in EQ at high low and mid<br/>
levels.  I have tried changing sound levels in my volume controls, all 6 of<br/>
them.  I have turned all the other sounds off and turned the volume way up<br/>
to see if I can hear any hint of a sound as something walks past me, no<br/>
luck.  I have an Aureal 3D card and have always had these problems.  Thanks<br/>
for the ideas though.<br/>

We had the same problem here (6 of us play at work, all have SBLive<br/>
Values)...one of the guys here figured out how to fix most of it.  Go to the<br/>
Control Panel, then Multimedia.  There should be a group box at the top<br/>
labled &quot;PlayBack&quot;...click on the Advancded Properties button.  Click on the<br/>
Performance tab, then check your hardware acelleration.  If the slider bar<br/>
is all the way to the right (&quot;Full&quot;), then drop it left one notch.  Then<br/>
click on the OK buttons till everything is closed : )<br/>
<br/>
I did this the other day, and the sounds seem to be working _a lot_ better<br/>
now.  (BTW....have a SBLive! Value with a Cambridge Soundworks DTT2500<br/>
speakers....now only complaint I have is the sub woofer...setting it to what<br/>
it should normally be at, it works fine...but my mage friend starting<br/>
summoning stuff and the walls start shaking :).<br/>

I have the exact same problem with my SB live card.  Spells sounds are<br/>
muffled when I stand (and being a dwarf, thats not very impressive) but<br/>
I sit down, and my roomate starts to complain about the racket...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Well - they&#39;re still doing weird things with sound.  I know that recently<br/>
&gt; all of my combat sounds started sounding &quot;really far away&quot; - Like they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; happening to someone standing near me, but not to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if I sit down, the sounds are suddenly right??  I guess they have the<br/>
&gt; &quot;center of source&quot; as the center of the model - not the model&#39;s head?<br/>
