<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s not the complexity or difficulty, its the bugs/bogus upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
  Fear, sheer raw volume of monsters with aggression ranges that make<br/>
  a 150 range arrow look like a spitball.  However, that said, fear is<br/>
  still the same fear it was months ago, there are just more things to<br/>
  kill.  It&#39;s the easiest (read: least buggy) of the planes.<br/>
<br/>
  Hate, pathing and pets.  When a monster doesn&#39;t have a pet by it&#39;s<br/>
  side, try to count to 10, you should be dead before you finish.<br/>
  I once saw a forsaken reverant on a pull run from the SW corner to<br/>
  the SE corner, then up the north patrol and back to the SW corner.<br/>
  (bind sight on him)  He came back with many friends.  It&#39;s ashame<br/>
  our armor is here.  I killed 6 static spawn banshees on Saturday,<br/>
  not one of them dropped a damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
  Sky, well you&#39;ve got two choices in sky.  Teleport in to a highly<br/>
  aggressive area with numerous L53+ monsters or teleport to an island<br/>
  with 3 monsters (L61, and two L53+) hehe.  People have been cheezin&#39;<br/>
  out the aggressive island by getting killed on the fairy island and<br/>
  and warping to the Aza island agro&#39;ing a few things and then getting <br/>
  a rez back to fairy island and flip a coin as to whether the npcs<br/>
  follow you back.  Pray it&#39;s not all of them.  PoS was not built with<br/>
  the current L50 in mind.  It really doesn&#39;t matter who you go with<br/>
  not many groups can handle mobs that deal thousands of dmg per round.<br/>
<br/>
  Nagafen, sometimes casters get bugged when AE fear wears off.  I<br/>
  think they fixed this last patch.  But Nagafen is still old naggy.<br/>
  He just has had his numbers tweaked for dmg output.<br/>
<br/>
  Vox, numerous upgrades.  She tends to want to stand and cast now,<br/>
  very hard to pull her out.  She resists slam/bash for all purposes.<br/>
  And she just sits there and c.heals all day.  Breath attack still<br/>
  does the same dmg to me, although others say it&#39;s upgraded.<br/>
<br/>
  Vox, Nagafen, and now the Noble in PoS...  one bubble hp lost to AE.<br/>
  Regardless of my resistance, I always get hit for a bub.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Verant can&#39;t make these things much harder.  The crappy client network<br/>
  code they have doesn&#39;t allow for more than 30 people to be in the same<br/>
  place at the same time fighting something.  They are making the dragons<br/>
  and the planes so hard that it feels like they want more people there.<br/>
  Even Gordo&#39; said it himself, Verant expects X number of people to be<br/>
  able to slay a dragon/god, and Y of them are expected to die.  If Y<br/>
  people don&#39;t die, Verant acts like a 12yr old GM and throws a little<br/>
  fit and whines and pouts, and gets even next time.<br/>
 <br/>
  &#39;5d10 wasn&#39;t enough, next time I&#39;ll make it 10d10, let&#39;s see how they<br/>
   like that.. hah&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  They couldn&#39;t handle the fact that people were doing Meteor Island<br/>
  in the Plane of Sky.  So what did they do?  Bump the numbers... add<br/>
  the most cheesiest thing ever, a friggin DT.  Try to pull those pretty<br/>
  shimmering meteors now, Verant thinks.  They melee in the 750s and<br/>
  DT every 30 seconds... I mean come on, that&#39;s kinda overboard.  They<br/>
  cannot make their NPCs smart enough with tactics, so they just add<br/>
  a DT so that those Y amount of players are bound to die.  If it takes<br/>
  2 minutes to kill CazicThule/Innoruuk/etc then thats at least 4 people<br/>
  who will be dead without even getting the chance to do anything about<br/>
  it.  I realize that when fighting a god, he should have godlike powers.<br/>
  But now Verant is equiping their normal mobs with Summon, with DT, with<br/>
  you must be in melee range to cast.  I don&#39;t think there will be a<br/>
  future if these sort of brute force tactics are continued to be applied.<br/>
