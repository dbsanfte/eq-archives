<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809347683">There&#39;s a nasty &#39;hole&#39; in Skyfire, behind the left wall just beyond the<br/>
Veeshan statue. We assumed that high wall was the zone wall when hunting<br/>
there once, and the monk ran up it to avoid getting a second mob on a pull.<br/>
He went over the top and fell to his death. I got a lev ring from our mage<br/>
and went corpse hunting. Over the top of the wall and down again, it looks<br/>
like a canyon, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any real exit. I loc&#39;ed the corpse<br/>
and pulled it out by finding one piece of the rockwall slanted enough to let<br/>
the combo of Selo&#39;s and the lev get me and the corpse out. We came out near<br/>
the statue. I never had the time since to go back and follow it the other<br/>
direction. Having fallen through the world a couple times, it gave me the<br/>
willies to top that steep wall both ways.<br/>
