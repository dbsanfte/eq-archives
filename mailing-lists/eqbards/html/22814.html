<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469607521">Killing Giants raises dwarves and dragons, I aimagine killing dwarves would<br/>
raise giants and dragons but am not sure.  I also imagine that killing<br/>
dragons will raise dwarves and giants.  Seems like you basically choose one<br/>
faction to hurt out of the three.  Note that the minus faction hits are more<br/>
significant than the plus hits so you can&#39;t kill the same number of giants<br/>
and dwarves without expecting to be KoS to both.<br/>

To you all that have been to Velious... Which factions are you watching out<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
from the little that I&#39;ve been/understand of it is that you kill 1 other 2<br/>
like you and so on<br/>
<br/>
Dragons/Giants/Dwarves</div>
