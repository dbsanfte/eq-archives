<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622817973">Well if you decide against Everlore there is always Allakhazams site as well<br/>
as the EQLizer site.  IMO those two are much better sites than Everlore.<br/>

This is totally not Bard related, but it is EQ-related.<br/>
<br/>
I was (asked? offered?) a place on EverLore.com for the EQ Glossary.  I&#39;ve <br/>
turned down one previous offer because the site looked like crud, and had <br/>
nothing to offer in return.  This one, however, is offering to build a <br/>
database to house the glossary (making updates Ooooh so easy), at the cost <br/>
of losing my banners.  While this may seem like a no-brainer (especially <br/>
considering I make NO money from the banners I&#39;m currently hosting), they <br/>
are for friends of mine, and I&#39;d hate to lose even this piddling little <br/>
advertising for them.  Unfortunately, Everlore is very strict :P  No <br/>
banners from outside sources.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the contract yet - waiting on a reply about that now.  But I <br/>
am really ambivalent about this (I *knew* I&#39;d find a way to use that word <br/>
this week ;)<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my dilemma - and I&#39;m not saying that you guys are going to solve <br/>
it for me - I just need some unbiased input here - Do I take the Lady or <br/>
the Tiger?<br/>
