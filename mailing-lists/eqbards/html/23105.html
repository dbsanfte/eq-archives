<div id="ygrps-yiv-869682307">Ummm, I think both of those would likely HT me for far more that a bub or 2<br/>
at 35th???  Wouldn&#39;t they?  Heck I don&#39;t know, if that&#39;s all HT does at that<br/>
level it is hardly fearsome in an outdoor situation.<br/>

probably for about a bub or 2 of health... Just think of how the king HT&#39;s<br/>
in sol b or lord in guk.  Just a hunch<br/>

How much does he Harmtouch for?  That&#39;s the primary concern that has kept me<br/>
from going to get this one.  I have little experience with shadowknights<br/>
past about 15th level so I have no idea how much their HT does.<br/>

I did get a SOW off of someone, invis&#39;d myself, found a Scrouger and DOT&#39;d <br/>
him. Reinvis&#39;d myself and had him follow me out of the chasm. He will DT <br/>
you, and that happened to be when I was passing another scorpion, but that <br/>
actually made it easier as then I just charm-kited once I got them both out <br/>
of the Chasm.<br/>
