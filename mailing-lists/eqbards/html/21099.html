<b>Subject:</b> Is there any hope?  was RE: [eqbards] Getting really Annoyed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593925303">Monday night I did a dumb thing.  My inventory was full from having<br/>
adventured for 4 or 5 days without visiting a merchant, so I refreshed my DE<br/>
illusion, memmed Carillon and went to Tin Merchant IX in the Overthere.  I<br/>
switched out my weapons for the drum to run there.  There wasn&#39;t a slot open<br/>
so I just left my Wraith Bone Hammer floating on the pointer.  I know, I<br/>
know, I should&#39;ve destroyed some muffins or carried them on the pointer.<br/>
Hindsight is 20/20.  Anyway I left clicked on the merchant to target him for<br/>
the Carillon and the trade window came up.  I cancelled the trade and the<br/>
Hammer dropped to the ground and the merchant picked it up and destroyed it.<br/>
I had Nodrop set to confirm.  I immediately petitioned it.  <br/>
<br/>
The Guide after some discussion promoted my petition to the Senior Guide.<br/>
The Senior Guide spoke to me Tuesday night, he wasn&#39;t online on Monday, and<br/>
asked where and when the event occurred.  He never got back to me before he<br/>
logged and I finally logged myself.  I haven&#39;t heard back from him yet.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion even in this situation the confirm drop window should have<br/>
come up and I could then have emptied an inventory slot, picking up<br/>
something less valuable to drop. <br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve been a Senior Guide, tell me, do I have any hope?<br/>
