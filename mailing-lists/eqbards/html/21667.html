<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195369186">Yea, that&#39;s mainly the reason I use Solon&#39;s Song of Siren&#39;s for most of my <br/>
fights and use Bewitching Bravura only when I have to. Also, if I have 2 <br/>
mobs, and 1 is 37 or less and the other is higher, I will keep charming the <br/>
lower level one with Solon&#39;s until near death, then switch to Bravura at <br/>
the end. I&#39;ve never run out of mana yet, but then again, I rarely <br/>
concentrate on just the 38th and higher ones. At least there&#39;s a quantified <br/>
reason to sing manasong for yourself during downtimes.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I cant tell you how much of a relief it is to hear the exact<br/>
&gt;problems I have been having over in Kunark!  I now know that the assumptions<br/>
&gt;I was going on were for Antonica rather than Kunark.  Let me ask you this --<br/>
&gt;how hard is the Dreadlands charming game.  The dreadlands seems pretty<br/>
&gt;crowded with hostiles, which is both an advantage and disadvantage when<br/>
&gt;charming for obvious reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Lago Bardoon<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also remember that while Hill Giants remember their last pet command<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will reattack automatically when recharmed, the Kunark giants will<br/>
&gt; &gt; not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generally have to reorder them to attack every time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         THIS is the problem I have been having!!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Anyone have a trick to this without getting the crap beat out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Lago Bardoon<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Depends on where you&#39;re hunting. The forest giants in the Frontier Mtns<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t remember their last command when you are having them fight each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other. However, they do remember if they are fighting other things. So it<br/>
&gt; &gt; may be good to have giant vs brute battles (kinda like watching one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; those Japanese monster movies)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In the Dreadlands, I have had pretty decent luck getting the various<br/>
&gt; &gt; steeps, craigs, and braes to attack each other by always keeping just 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; charmed and not switching targets. It seems like if I just charm 1 target<br/>
&gt; &gt; and then switch only if my target is about to die, I can keep them<br/>
&gt; &gt; targeted<br/>
&gt; &gt; on each other about 75% of the time (not really quantified, just an<br/>
&gt; &gt; approximate guess).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I run into problems when I charm the other one instead, as my previous pet<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems to remember how much he hates me and chases me all around the snowy<br/>
&gt; &gt; tundra despite having my new pet beat his head in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But just like in FM, I have no problems with my targets aggroing on each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other if they aren&#39;t both giants. Spiders vs yetis vs drolvargs vs giants,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; they all hate each other and forget about me as soon as charm kicks in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ------<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for what to do when both forget about each other and come after you<br/>
&gt; &gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; after you have charmed one, I have my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key set at #1<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; my number keypad. After I get a charm to stick, I immediately turn back on<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; selo&#39;s, target the other creature, and instead of running directly away<br/>
&gt; &gt; from them run at a path roughly perpendicular to their incoming path, then<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; mash the &quot;pet attack&quot; key.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Either my pet will get close enough to hear it and start attacking, or my<br/>
&gt; &gt; path is at a shallow enough path that the other giant is just barely able<br/>
&gt; &gt; to hit me before I get out of his range. That gets my pet on him one way<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other.  I suppose if you are a master charmer, before you charm, get a<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; consonant chain on your intended victim, switch targets and charm your now<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; faster pet, and give him his order without getting beaten on. I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; this a little bit, but after twisting for a few hours just find this a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; too tricky.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You still get beat up pretty good at times, and the 1 fatality I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; &gt; (in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a long time) was because I had 2 steeps and a brae on me and between their<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuns and interruptions of my songs, couldn&#39;t get away. Now I find when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; get in a tough spot like that, I just run out of their aggro and zone/camp<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and return.<br/>
