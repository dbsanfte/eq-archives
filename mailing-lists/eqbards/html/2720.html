<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789411545">the level 50 song is called Verses of Victory, but it doesn&#39;t say who wrote<br/>
it =P  i am guessing Vilia, who also wrote Verses of Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
i am assuming the fact that Desperate Dirge hurts yourself also has to be a<br/>
bug.  it is supposed to be a desparation song, so using it should not kill<br/>
yourself, since you would be low on health when you use it!<br/>
<br/>
my other bard friend suggested using Curtailing Chant before one of the<br/>
tuyens songs to lower the mob&#39;s magic resistance thus making chant of flame<br/>
not get resisted, and she said it worked pretty well.  plus you can stack<br/>
the fufil&#39;s and tuyen&#39;s chant songs to do some decent DoT damage.<br/>
<br/>
by the way, no new songs in erudin, just level 43 and 50 in freeport and<br/>
qeynos.<br/>

&gt; Actually those 2 showed up a few patches ago. We appear to have gotten<br/>
&gt; the promised L43 song Desperate Dirge, and a L50 song, whose name I<br/>
&gt; forgot to write down. (sorry) I managed to check everywhere but Erudin<br/>
&gt; last night so there may be more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the Dirge, it will also damage you as well as the monsters it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; targetting, so watch it if you attempt to actually use it if you are<br/>
&gt; desperate and low on health. It took about a RL hour to fully <br/>
&gt; regain my<br/>
&gt; mana after using the song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The various chants supposedly had their damage increased, but at least<br/>
&gt; on testing on myself, it appears that it has actually decreased. Chant<br/>
&gt; of Flame used to do about 30, 10 over 3 ticks. Now it appears <br/>
&gt; to do 22,<br/>
&gt; 11 over 2 ticks. Also, Chant of Flame, at least, appears to <br/>
&gt; be resisted<br/>
&gt; so much that I&#39;m finding it questionable whether it&#39;s worth keeping<br/>
&gt; loaded. Like many spells that have 2 effects, it appears that this<br/>
&gt; doubles the chance for the mob to resist the song, and in my tests<br/>
&gt; yesterday, I rarely saw it actually take. It&#39;s too bad too, because if<br/>
&gt; we bards could lower fire resistance significantly it would allow the<br/>
&gt; higher level Druid&#39;s who&#39;ve been complaining that their only good in<br/>
&gt; dungeon direct damage spells were useless to have a better chance of<br/>
&gt; hitting too.<br/>
