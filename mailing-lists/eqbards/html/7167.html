<b>Subject:</b> RE: Soloing, and Vs. other Classed(was: Bards) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660892549">I am going to have to agree with Wayne on that. (being that bards can out-spell<br/>
other melee-based hybrids, and out-melee spell-based hybrids or casters [even<br/>
armor wearing ones])<br/>
<br/>
As for soloing, i have had absolutely no problem soloing up to 20. (i realize<br/>
that is not high level or anything, but i will get to a point i hope)  Soloing<br/>
is all a matter of finding the right MOB for your skills. the case example for<br/>
bards are the Beetles in North Karana for Bards.  they range in level from 11<br/>
to 19.  At 12th Level, i was able to kite the 18th lvl ones (19th resisted too<br/>
much) and could kite/melee the rest.  as the level of the mob got lower, i<br/>
could melee more, and kite less. This was the PERFECT spot for XP for levels<br/>
12-20 for a bard.  Keep in mind, NO LOOT.  I do not need to find another spot,<br/>
since i have caught up to my friends close enough to be useful.  <br/>
<br/>
Bards CAN solo effectively, but they have to find the right mobs to hunt.  I<br/>
don&#39;t feel like i have been going with one hand tied behind my back or anything<br/>
:-)  Of course, soloing is BORING and ANTISOCIAL, so i am glad that i don&#39;t<br/>
HAVE to do it.  (but i feel that lvl 1 to lvl 20 in 6 days played is pretty<br/>
good for a self-styled non-powergamer (mastered Baking in that time too!))<br/>
<br/>
My second point is about the no weapons as good as the Crook that aren&#39;t 30+. <br/>
I have to disagree.  Dirk is just as good.  Barbed Leather Whip is just as<br/>
good.  If it is pre-dualwield then having an SBS is VERY powerful, post<br/>
dualwield and you can use 2 very good weapons. My melee skills are much better<br/>
at 20 (MUCH) than my friend&#39;s (lvl 20 Barbarian Shaman).  But, my Strength is<br/>
up to 103, which probably makes a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Post is too long already...but i ramble.<br/>
(i don&#39;t think i ever did make a point :-( )<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
