&gt;a lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>
&gt;everyone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>
&gt;songs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>
&gt;coming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>
&gt;just saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>
&gt;shields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at the<br/>
&gt;druid)<br/>

Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just watching, &quot;An orc <br/>
oracle begins to cast a spell.  You feel drowsy.&quot;<br/>
In the middle of combat with a whole other party!  That&#39;s Bard Hate.<br/>
