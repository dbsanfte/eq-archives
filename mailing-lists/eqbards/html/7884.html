<div id="ygrps-yiv-389313011">An open-ended roll would acount for the extremes without messing up the fit<br/>
from a straight subtraction.  that means if you were 96% sure you would<br/>
instantly be 146% sure on the average, heh heh.<br/>

&gt; suddenly its a whopping<br/>

Yup.  I&#39;m 95% sure this is how it works, although I suspect<br/>
it&#39;s not a straight subtraction, rather it&#39;s curved near the<br/>
extremes.<br/>
