wield has a 40% chance of activating, it doesn&#39;t matter if the<br/>
weapon in your off hand has a 10 delay or a 100 delay, it will<br/>
still activate 40% of the time and thus do 40% of the damage<br/>
it would do if wielded in your primary hand.  There are some<br/>
slight nonlinearities that favor faster weapons, but the #1<br/>
factor in deciding which weapon goes into your primary hand<br/>
should be avg damage/time (use a log parser) + procs.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for putting a fast weapon in your primary is to<br/>
raise dual wield skill - a 10 delay weapon would give 60 dual<br/>
wield checks (and thus chances to improve) every minute.  A<br/>
100 delay weapon would only give 6 checks.  If your skill is<br/>
maxed, this is a non-issue.<br/>
<br/>
(For those of you who remember, the disagreement JM and I had<br/>
over this was a matter of definition - he was using dam/delay<br/>
ratio, I was using average damage over time.)<br/>
