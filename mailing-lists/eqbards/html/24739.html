<div id="ygrps-yiv-759296332">I have charm kited quite a bit -- both in Rathe Mtns and EW coldain camps.<br/>
BEFORE the patch you could charm the cook, who has the most hps, and zip away quickly -- since your pet takes on your faction, all the other dorfs would beat on it for the next 12 second and bring it down to about half health.  Only worked on the first charm and then they all wanted your blood.  <br/>
After that I would simply charm until one of the mobs started to wander off--signaling very low hp.  I would let charm expire and then chant whichever mob was lowest for full xp.  I would gain a quarter bubble of xp per coldain village at 41 doing this and solo four in about 20 minutes.  Your pet will poof if it&#39;s killed while charming but that&#39;s the only way it happens.  Killing stuff with our dots doesn&#39;t make it poof either.<br/>
With the nerf, coldain charm kiting is still possible but it&#39;sa lot riskier.  and you don&#39;t want to do missionaries this way -- takes too much time to target -- command the pet -- and retarget and also run when you are being chased by four coldain and being struck down by wrath spells.<br/>
My xp has slowed now -- and my 51st druid friend can still quad kite wyverns for a quarter bubble of xp every time.  Why does it always seem like bards are the ones to get &quot;nerfed&quot;?<br/>

That may work while soloing (I&#39;m not sure as I don&#39;t charm kite), but <br/>
he was trying to show with his example that &quot;allowing charm to break&quot; <br/>
in a group setting would poof the mob you&#39;re fighting.  In that <br/>
situation, it would be pretty difficult to try and recharm the mob <br/>
you&#39;re fighting (to clear it&#39;s damage list) while everyone&#39;s beating <br/>
on it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as mana regen goes, without numbers to back it up, I&#39;d trust <br/>
Kaeria&#39;s findings before I&#39;d trust anyone else&#39;s.  Kaeria&#39;s findings <br/>
show that NO mana regen works on Bards except sitting.<br/>
