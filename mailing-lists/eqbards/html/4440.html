<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778374286">&quot;So what&#39;s in the lake in the West Commons anyway? Can you zone<br/>
to/fromthe<br/>
Ocean Of Tears? Who needs a stinky boat - I&#39;m swimming from Freeport to<br/>
Butcherblock!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I know what you&#39;re saying. I can&#39;t wait for this song myself. I am<br/>
dying ot jump through the holes in the ice in the frozen river in<br/>
Everfrost. But, alas, you cannot zone thorugh Ocean of Tears without<br/>
being on a boat. Can&#39;t even zone if you are on the little canoes.<br/>
<br/>
You learn things from falling off of the boat.</div>
