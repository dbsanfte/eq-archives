The main problem I had was the mob being dispelled and my<br/>
Chants being canceled.  At least it doesn&#39;t cost me any mana<br/>
to reapply them.  Also, once you get a feel for how long it<br/>
takes your group to kill a mob, you can stop your Chants and<br/>
wade in with your weapons for a little extra damage.  For the<br/>
folks I&#39;m usually with, that happens on the second application<br/>
of the Chants in Fear, and when the mobs are at half hp in<br/>
Hate.  From that point on, the Chants I&#39;ve put on will last<br/>
most of the remainder of the fight, so I go ahead and switch<br/>
to weapons.<br/>

experience - you&#39;re also helping wizards land IC for more<br/>
damage, druids land starfire for more damage, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just a warning - be very careful using them on Tentacle<br/>
Tormenters in Fear.  Every time one of those has died to a DoT<br/>
for us, the corpse has poofed.  I usually try applying two<br/>
Chants at the beginning of a fight with TTs, then switch to<br/>
melee.<br/>
