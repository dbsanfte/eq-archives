<div id="ygrps-yiv-685495018">Hehe - my mind boggles too! <br/>
<br/>
My best levels were 4,5,6 (Locate, speed & heal)!!! I don&#39;t feel much<br/>
different that when I was around 15-17ish (getting dual wield was a great<br/>
achievement to me &lt;g&gt;) Then 20 was great for invis and I could explore some<br/>
and learn who can &quot;see invis&quot; -- ugh Borxx and his dazed buddys.  And then<br/>
the 26,27,28 songs (fear, charm, mez) I felt like a real bard.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah -=&lt;*32*&gt;=- and uber-bard now - well kinda.  I see someone (caster)<br/>
sitting and so I toss an invite.  And I get &quot;ack! u r green to me!&quot; (like<br/>
they think I wanna go deep into the dungeon with them) So I go, &quot;hey I&#39;ll<br/>
heal med then dis u - unless my mana is too green for u? &lt;smiles&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is different.  I can&#39;t (solo) fight anything that will give me xp<br/>
in any sort of efficient manner unless I am with a good group.  The places<br/>
for my level are pretty hard now (Old Guk, Nagafens) and I can&#39;t join just<br/>
any group.  The chances are pretty high that I will die and if I do, it&#39;s<br/>
probably impossible for me to get my own stuff.  So, I gotta be in a group I<br/>
can trust enuf to consent and it&#39;s gotta have a cleric.  First off to keep<br/>
me alive and secondly to rez me when I do die.  Although I seem to be<br/>
getting past this die-ing business.  I have not died with my regular group<br/>
in sometime now.  Either we are not stretching our limits like we used to or<br/>
we have just gotten a bit better. <br/>
 <br/>
I think the next step is getting to know more players who are my level and<br/>
know who I can safely group with.  I had a good expedition into Permafrost<br/>
to the King room - with a &#39;pick-up&#39; group - but I knew the leaders and they<br/>
were pretty high levels.  We killed some stuff and got the champion to spawn<br/>
and got him too.  Everyone had one all ready or could not use so I got my<br/>
CrysBlade the old fashioned way!  I looted it!  Then the Ice Giant Priestess<br/>
was pulled and we had more than we could handle.  Thank thee Gods that our<br/>
druid had the good sense to evac when he did -  Loading, Please Wait... You<br/>
have entered Butcher Block, never thought I would be so happy to be there!<br/>
<br/>
Later last night, my reg group has camped the assassin room in old guk.  I<br/>
meet our Shadow Knight at he zone and she guides me thru upper - something<br/>
sees thru my invis and attacks me like always and without my guide I&#39;d<br/>
prolly be running back to the zone.  But at least now, in lguk, I can find<br/>
the bedroom and can hug the wall past he greater dark bones and from there<br/>
on to the assassin room.  So we spend a few good hours in there and I did<br/>
get mine!!  Now WOO HOO!!!  That is almost as great as getting my speed<br/>
song!  Hehe, the guise is great - for some reason - I really wanted one!<br/>
And hack, slash and killing my way up to 35 - how I did it boggles my mind<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  but it was really fun to &quot;be there&quot; in one of the really hard places<br/>
and loot one of the treasures of the game.  And now, here&#39;s what I have been<br/>
working on for 35 levels -- so ok - where can I buy some milk and muffins in<br/>
Neriak???<br/>
