<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707370679">funny you should mention that.  I was asking the same question today on<br/>
concerthall.  for some oddball reason our mez overwrites chanter mez. I&#39;ve<br/>
had a few bored chanters/confused when I start CC. Was grouped with an old<br/>
guildie from sol ro yesterday when I had to mez 4 at a time while they beat<br/>
the 5th down and she was quite &quot;wow bards can do that?&quot; and rest of group<br/>
was somewhat like that too.  I told her, I&#39;m not a manasong bard...<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here&#39;s the thread<br/>

Played Tani for most of the weekend, had a blast.  I&#39;ve spent most of my<br/>
higher levels soloing or duoing, and this weekend, I ventured into Sebilis.<br/>
Wow, what an education.  When we had a chanter, life was all fun... he<br/>
slowed, messed and hasted.  I really didnt have to do any work but when I<br/>
was the crowd control.. well, wow.. its really hard to mes things and then<br/>
still fight the target mob.  I started to get the hang of it though and<br/>
found outside views really help a lot.<br/>
 <br/>
My question is, what is up with the 53 mez and chanter mez?  I found out the<br/>
hard way (i.e. group death spree) that they don&#39;t seem to stack!?!  But my<br/>
53 mez seemed to overwrite the 59 chanter mez???!!! Whats up with that?  Am<br/>
I wrong here?  What am I missing?<br/>

about? Seems like lots are lately =/<br/>
