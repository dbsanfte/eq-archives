&gt; A pity.  I don&#39;t remember such great things existing in UO in its first 6<br/>
&gt; months either so maybe you should give EQ more time to mature as a<br/>
&gt; community, not necessarily as a game.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how much I am going to miss the bard class, the feeling<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; running around the countryside exploring, hunting (which is so much finer<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; EQ than UO, I mean duh).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But my wife, of all people, pointed out that hearing about UO stories used<br/>
&gt; to be great, the interactions, the intruiges, the plots the schemes, and<br/>
&gt; that largely hearing about EQ was boring. Killed this, killed that, got<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; got that, had goofy fun with a small group of folks. Which is all fine,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; not very creative sounding. Then on the very same day friends from Siege<br/>
&gt; Perilous start sending me emails out of the blue...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For all the thrill of EQ hunting, visuals, for all the total rockingness<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the Bard class...I am left feeling like I am not creating what I want to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; creating in an online world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In UO I raised huge armies (more than anyone else actually) got whole<br/>
shards<br/>
&gt; in an uproar, wrote a lot of story, all without one bit of help from OSI.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And now once again I am off to Siege Perilous, where have gathered some of<br/>
&gt; the best story people from all the shards. The Imperium, The Sinful, the<br/>
&gt; Temple of Monadain, Shadowclan orcs, the Mordain sisters and more. I go<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; to revive Tengu the Summoner, but to reinvent him. (Heeee! I just HAD to<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; that *laughs*).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back to the old stinky interface the old stinky spawn, the old stinky<br/>
combat<br/>
&gt; system...all those I can live with, but I can&#39;t live without large scale<br/>
&gt; creative community. And all the biggies of large scale creative community<br/>
&gt; are on SP. So off I go. It&#39;s been a total blast, I will miss the Bard<br/>
class<br/>
&gt; most of all...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep your lutes dry and your blade polished.<br/>
