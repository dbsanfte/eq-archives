<div id="ygrps-yiv-281989346">The &quot;Hail&quot; range is smaller than normal &quot;say&quot; range.  I have found that you<br/>
need to be up close and personal with NPC&#39;s when you &quot;hail&quot; them.  This guy<br/>
is the banker too.  Has a name that is like Wellsian Faragan (or something<br/>
to allude to Wells Fargo.)  He has bracketed key words but also has some<br/>
&quot;hidden&quot; ones too.<br/>
<br/>
The differences we see in mob agro behavior is probably mostly the level<br/>
difference factor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; * Yes *  And talk to the guy banker - he talks about giving you<br/>
something &quot;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; composer&quot; left with him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woohoo, a quest!  I was being total newbie dork last night.  Hailing<br/>

&gt; looking. </span></blockquote></div>
