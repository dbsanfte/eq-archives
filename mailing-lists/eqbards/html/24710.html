<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553099040">A good friend and guildmate of mine, Tularane attended the event. As a bard,<br/>
naturally I was curious as to who got the scales. When I heard that 2<br/>
dropped ( has it always been that she drops two?), I said to myself that I<br/>
needed to get my alt up and Vox capable. If our guild would host it, we&#39;d<br/>
fully random the scales, not to bards only. I was thinking that if everyone<br/>
can roll on the scale(s), more people may attend. It&#39;s already stated that<br/>
if one of our guildmates or allied members win the lotto, they will give me<br/>
the scale. I don&#39;t know how fair it all sounds, but as the hosting guild, we<br/>
could actually claim a dragonscale to our own, no matter what but we aren&#39;t.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem so underhanded if you think about it. :) A kill is a kill.<br/>
What is done with the loot is up to the hosting party, and we want to be<br/>
fair as we can!<br/>
<br/>
As of last weekend, I have everything but the 2 dragonscales and trak guts,<br/>
and the minor metal bits. (Like the NPC can&#39;t make his own darn bits...)<br/>
