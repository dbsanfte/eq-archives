You do not have to constantly tried it.  if it fail then I would understand<br/>
you trying it again but if it is successful use one other song at least.<br/>

Well there are excuses to play only one at a time, but only a few. I will<br/>
often only play Chain when my primary function is to slow a mob for my<br/>
casters to Kite. If I am consistently Chaining without fail then I will<br/>
twist in a Fear or a Bellow between Chains, but if your fighting large red<br/>
mobs like Griffins and Hill Giants slowing them is the primary function and<br/>
takes precedence over anything else.<br/>

I know what you mean.  I do not understand how a lvl 24 bard not know the<br/>
usefullness of playing multisongs.  Last night I was group with a bard and 4<br/>
other plp.  This bard is a lvl 24.  She will play Bellow while fighting only<br/>
then Hymn after battle.  I asked her that she know that we can play 3 song<br/>
at a time right and she said yeah and that was it.  When I started playing<br/>
my Anthem, Psalm, and healing during battle the group was so impress.  They<br/>
were like wow you can play 3 songs at a time?  I was like yes.  I told them<br/>
that if they ever group with a bard expect at least 2 songs at a time.<br/>
There is no excuse not to play more than 1 song.<br/>
