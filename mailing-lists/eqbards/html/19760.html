<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-124278186">Um. My bard used to be able to equip the Lisera&#39;s Lute... She just couldn&#39;t<br/>
use it as a lute. I would use it to travel through town wiht a weapon plus<br/>
a instrument at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
It is ALl/All so is also that way to make a &quot;troll bard&quot;<br/>

&gt;i can&#39;t remember the exact name, but i think i have this lute called a<br/>
&gt;lisera lute (i think). i was just wondering if it was any better/worse than<br/>
&gt;my present lute (plain, boring, found in any store).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried this recently, but Lisera (from Cassius at the Bard Guild<br/>
&gt;in Qeynos)<br/>
&gt;is not equippable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I completed this quest when I was level 5 and so couldn&#39;t equip the Lute if<br/>
&gt;I wanted to.  I was scared out of my wits running all that way to South<br/>
&gt;Karana, and then amazed at seeing a bull elephant walk right past me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ahh. Happy days. :) </span></blockquote></div>
