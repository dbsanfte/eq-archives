<div id="ygrps-yiv-972622828">Hi,<br/>
Great stories. esp the cyclops wrestling one *rofl* Keep em coming.<br/>
Well I have seen quite a few posts these last days around money. I agree<br/>
that 200pp is not something you make in a night at my level, but who<br/>
counts, Currently my belongings consist of:<br/>
- 100pp (could have been more like 200 if I dident borrow money to everyone<br/>
who asks and wasent fooling around with baking)<br/>
- Combine scimitar (my first magical weapon bought from gypsies and still<br/>
in use)<br/>
- Dragoon dirk (Travelled to CB and bought one before they went Lore)<br/>
- Bloodstained mantle (helped a Highlevel char with corpse retriveal..<br/>
Dident expect this WOW)<br/>
- Full set of banded/ringmail (I think bronze is too damned heavy)<br/>
- Couple of dervrings and Onyx rings<br/>
- Complete set of leather in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
 I know its not any fiery avenger like magic items, but I think my<br/>
equipment is allright for my level =). I am in no rush making big money or<br/>
buying the latest greatest stuff published on EQlizer. Some (if not all) of<br/>
my caster friends are quite poor. Mostly because they spend alot of thier<br/>
money on spells. Also some of my non caster friends are poor as hell, but<br/>
thats mostly because they buy alot of magic stuff.<br/>
Ohh btw. I make around 5-10pp in a 2-3hours session - If its money I was<br/>
after I think I could boots that 10-15pp.<br/>

Sorry for the late post.  I have been on vacation.<br/>
I hate checking my mail on vacation.  I like playing EQ tho.<br/>
<br/>
Topic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>
for 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>
<br/>
1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw<br/>
   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>
   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>
<br/>
2) People who claim that plat is worthless, and that making<br/>
   a couple hundred pp is no big deal are full of it.  That&#39;s<br/>
   that traditional level 35+ person talking.  Refer to earlier<br/>
   comment on my level at the time.  You don&#39;t make that much<br/>
   money if you are a lower level adventurer.<br/>
<br/>
3) I&#39;ve seen those gloves sell for 35pp to 45pp, in fact people<br/>
   are willing to hand those gloves out at no cost sometimes!<br/>
   I like to deal the price down on anything I buy, I don&#39;t just<br/>
   throw plat at people for good items.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I bought elfhide gloves from a friend of mine last<br/>
week for 75pp.  She needed the money, and you know what?  I had<br/>
the money.  For once in my poor EQ career, I was starting to earn<br/>
money.  Anyone under level 25 can appreciate that... you won&#39;t<br/>
make money until you are around level 30 or so.  All the people<br/>
who claim to make mad money are all over level 25 - there is no<br/>
trick to it.  Level = Money.<br/>
<br/>
I also bought two star ruby golden rings (300pp total - killer deal)<br/>
Yes, because I had the money.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels ago,<br/>
when I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down around<br/>
50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my money. =)<br/>
