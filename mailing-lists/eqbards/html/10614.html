I agree. If there were npc bards that use songs I wouldn&#39;t care to fight one <br/>
unless he dropped something really nice...there is one mob that I know we <br/>
could kill, but the effort isn&#39;t worth it to me - the froglok noble in guk <br/>
liveside. I hate that thing.<br/>

&gt;Ok, two quick things here, One, I agree the Mail Bards suck just<br/>
&gt;punching and stuff. my 23 sk was able to solo Dark Deathsinger in<br/>
&gt;Innothule regularly, and he was YELLOW (around 25th level, try THAT with<br/>
&gt;any other Named NPC).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Two, If Bards WERE to get a combat AI including songs, every player on<br/>
&gt;every server would immediately complain: &quot;I ran into some Froglock, who<br/>
&gt;conned blue, named &quot;A froglock minstrel&quot; but as soon as I pulled him, he<br/>
&gt;started singing! Then ALL my songs were resisted, he interrupted all of<br/>
&gt;my spells, and chained me when I tried to run.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;We went back with 5 tanks and this time the thing charmed our lead<br/>
&gt;tank, sang some horrible AE song, and made all the warriors nod off!<br/>
&gt;then when we thought we had him, he teleported away, with us losing<br/>
&gt;health to the AE song the whole time. Still we just about had him when<br/>
&gt;he let out some Dirge, and POOF killed 4 of the tanks&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; It seems a reasonably obvious assumption that the reason why there are <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt; &gt; froglok bards etc.  or any bards other than in guildhalls or mail <br/>
&gt;delivery is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that there is NO combat AI for NPC bards.  they are treated as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warrior/rogue/monk with our poor melee skills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; my (slapped together) justifications for this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.  When charmed, we Punch, or melee with whatever we have equipped.  I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; not seen or heard of a bard play a single song while charmed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  the Mail delivery bards just stand there and punch when they are <br/>
&gt;attacked.<br/>
