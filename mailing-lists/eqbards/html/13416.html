<div id="ygrps-yiv-440529194">That&#39;s pet peeve number two for me - number two - because at least it&#39;s only<br/>
one mouseclick.  But how about having to hit enter three times to see the<br/>
logos? And worse - is it really necessary to agree to the license agreement<br/>
the hundreds if not thousands of times I&#39;ve logged into the game?  And to<br/>
make it worse - they set the default focus on the decline button!<br/>
<br/>
I can understand the marketing bozos wanting to make sure we see those<br/>
Corporate logos - because they sure are going to want us to shell out the<br/>
bucks for the new games when they come out.  But to the lawyer bozos insist<br/>
on this crap or is it just incredibly lazy programming?<br/>

&gt; Speaking of which, is it unreasonable to set our default travelling pace<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Run&quot; so that we don&#39;t have to turn this on whenever we log in. Does<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; &quot;walk&quot; in this game? (&quot;sneakers&quot; don&#39;t count) This is one of the ways I<br/>
&gt; &quot;spot a newbie&quot; is the fact that they&#39;re walking around in the newbie<br/>
&gt; killing zones, casually sauntering around trying to catch up to things to<br/>
&gt; kill.<br/>
