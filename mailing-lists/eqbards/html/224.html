<div id="ygrps-yiv-706477266"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Anyway, I tried using it (lament, that is), and besides &quot;&lt;creature&gt;<br/>
&gt;looks sad&quot; or just pissing it off and making it come at me, I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t figure out what it does.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like a Lull.  It&#39;s a very specialized song, but incredibly useful in <br/>
the right circumstances.  Say you have two monsters standing near each <br/>
other (like the orcs at the front gate of Crushbone) and you&#39;d like to <br/>
fight them one at a time.  You edge up towards them, targeting one with the <br/>
Lament and trying it until you get close enough for it to go off. When you <br/>
see the &quot;looks sad&quot; message, quickly run up close enough to get the other <br/>
monster&#39;s attention and then back away again.  The &quot;sad&quot; monster won&#39;t <br/>
chase you, if everything worked right.<br/>
<br/>
This of course works much better with a group, where you can lull one <br/>
monster and have someone throw a spell at the second one.  Far less chance <br/>
of accidentally picking up both of them.<br/>
