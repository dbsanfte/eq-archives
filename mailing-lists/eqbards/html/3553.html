<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885947409">Well, my alter-ego, a Gnome enchanter, was playing Mr. Postman on his way<br/>
to High Hold to buy a new spell, when he ran into the most interesting<br/>
situation.  Being the naturally curious sort, he wondered what could<br/>
possibly be so important that it&#39;d be locked in a cabin in the middle of<br/>
the Kithicor woods? So, after determining that the door was impassable<br/>
without a Rogue&#39;s assistance, he took a tour around the house.  He noticed<br/>
a snake heading my way, so he stepped aside to let it pass, when suddenly,<br/>
he noticed it slide UNDER the house.  How interesting, he thought to<br/>
himself, and crouched down to get a better look.  Apparently the foundation<br/>
wasn&#39;t very solid, and had been a bit washed away in the omnipresent rains.<br/>
 Crawling underneath the building, he poked around for a moment to see if<br/>
perhaps the chimney, which was still firmly attached to the earth, would<br/>
provide a possible entrypoint.  Forgetting where he was for a moment, he<br/>
stood up to ponder, and suddenly realized that he was INSIDE!  How could<br/>
that be?  He checked for trapdoors or holes in the floor, to no avail.<br/>
Suddenly he realized the full enormity of the situation.  The door closed,<br/>
locked, he on the inside meant only one thing: he was trapped.  *sigh* Good<br/>
thing he&#39;s a spellcaster, and had Gate available.  The bad news is, he was<br/>
heading for High Hold Pass, and was still bound to Steamfont.  Sooooo, 4<br/>
hours later, he FINALLY made it to the Keep and bought his new spell.  No<br/>
more wandering in Kithicor for him!<br/>
