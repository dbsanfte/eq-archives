<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210513862">Good advice. Thanks to those who replied! Think I&#39;ll focus on making it to<br/>
17 then see what I can afford. The Dirk will get me that far.<br/>
<br/>
3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>
 &quot;I don&#39;t know yer server but on the Rathe Hell NO&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pinen: LOL, appreciate the blunt truth )<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unless you get a group to help you camp the PGT spawn, it will be almost<br/>
impossible for you to get a PGT by yourself. &lt;snip&gt; The going rate for a PGT<br/>
on E&#39;ci is around 300PP if<br/>
you don&#39;t want to camp for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Galtin: No way I can afford that today. But appreciate the camping advice.<br/>
Already noticed the group benefit last night in a FFA battle (bards and<br/>
shamans rock!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Depends on the jerk ratio on your server.  On Karana it&#39;s<br/>
seemingly forever camped by kill stealers and casters who<br/>
can&#39;t use it (hint - write down their names, and never group<br/>
with them once you get the mana song).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
John Kim: Excellent idea. I&#39;ve found that to be true in other areas as well.<br/>
When you discover a player is just self-serving and gives nothing, not even<br/>
a thanks, I think the best response is to ignore them. You can&#39;t teach these<br/>
people anything, and they are more than happy to escalate a confrontation<br/>
with posturing, profanity, and character-defaming shouts. Wit and wisdom are<br/>
lost on them, so why bother wasting the gift of your presence on such as<br/>
they? : )<br/>
