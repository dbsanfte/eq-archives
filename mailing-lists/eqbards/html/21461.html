<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-575035924">You know what&#39;s really irritating?  It&#39;s quite possible that they noticed this because of comments in one<br/>
of the many Bard threads discussing Bard balance.  I certainly didn&#39;t see it on the Quality and Assurance<br/>
board.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that it&#39;s clearly a bug, and wasn&#39;t what they intended.  But it&#39;s also true that the game as<br/>
currently designed was balanced at least in part by observing how well players were doing with the current<br/>
set of rules, and this is a pretty big change.  And as Mike Merck noted, this now means that OUR haste<br/>
adds are inferior to other classes&#39; haste adds, not equal.  So chalk up another &quot;X&quot; in the players vs.<br/>
Verant debit column, and another &quot;X&quot; in the Bard balance debit column.<br/>

&gt; Looks like we&#39;re going to get nerfed again...  Here&#39;s a quote I just got off<br/>
&gt; Everlore about today&#39;s patch...  OK, granted it&#39;s not just a nerf to us, but<br/>
&gt; all the &quot;battle bards&quot; will definitely be affected by it...  Now watch as<br/>
&gt; they make it so that ONLY bards using haste songs and FBSS&#39;s will fight<br/>
&gt; SLOWER...<br/>

&gt; In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a<br/>
&gt; bug with the way &quot;haste&quot; items stack with &quot;haste&quot; spells. Basically, even<br/>
&gt; the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the<br/>
&gt; wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items<br/>
&gt; and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste<br/>
&gt; items aren&#39;t any better than the FBSS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is being fixed in tomorrow&#39;s patch.<br/>
