<div id="ygrps-yiv-60635845">Great another unannounced change to a spell every member of certain classes<br/>
depends on acting a certain way.  I think they should just go to patch<br/>
messages that say &quot;we changed some stuff, good luck&quot; if that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot see how this was unbalanced in any way so I wonder if this change<br/>
was purposeful, assuming it has occurred.  Its always been like that for all<br/>
snare spells, so why change it now?  They find out people could snare kite<br/>
Venril Sathir? ;-p<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that Verant has changed our snares to no longer completely stop<br/>
mobs dead in their tracks.  Might wanna be careful tonight guys.<br/>
