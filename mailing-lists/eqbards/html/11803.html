<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609341603"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How hard is the Efreeti to kill, where does he spawn. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The Efreeti Lord is in SolB, opposite the giants, pretty<br/>
  deep back.  He is L50.  His placeholder is a lava guardian.<br/>
  He is guarded by two L48 imp protectors.  It absolutely takes<br/>
  at least two groups to reach him.  Every time I&#39;ve seen one <br/>
  group persue the boots, they were doing CR afterwards.  You<br/>
  have to dispatch a handful of L39-41 sonic bats, possibly<br/>
  a few lava beetles and lava duct crawlers to reach the stepping<br/>
  stone room.  There you will find two or three lava guardians.<br/>
  Beyond that there are two or three imp protectors.  Beyond <br/>
  that &lt;g&gt; there is another spawn of lava guardian / imp protectors.<br/>
  Then you can reach the Efreeti&#39;s Room.  Enchanter required the<br/>
  whole way, imo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And how often does he drop those Boots?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Boots are common, the ring is &#39;rare&#39;.  The boots seem to drop<br/>
  less than 75% of the time.  Getting the Efreeti to spawn is<br/>
  a whole &#39;nother story.  He usually has his darn placeholder <br/>
  pop up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve heard those Efreeti boots trade VERY highly - I&#39;ve seen mithril or<br/>
&gt; Ykesha&#39;s trade with that one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Chances are, if you have a pair of these you looted them from the<br/>
  Efreeti yourself and are wearing them.  Bards have no real reason<br/>
  to want to wear these boots.  In fact, I dont include myself in <br/>
  the random, nor would I let other melee classes do so.<br/>
