&gt;I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and cloack, and<br/>
&gt;blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>
&gt;help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>
&gt;charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>
&gt;isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>
&gt;level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>
&gt;support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel. May your songs be well<br/>
&gt;recieved!<br/>

helped her get the ingredients for the Brewer&#39;s Compendium as she<br/>
can&#39;t charm those halflings in Rivervale like I can ;-)  So now she<br/>
owes me.<br/>
