<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111713845">of course it depends on the group.  but you will eventually run into this,<br/>
and i think we are just trying to give you a heads up of what to expect.  i<br/>
have never had one chain last a whole fight.  it can last several seconds,<br/>
but even on greens it won&#39;t last nearly as long as snare.  if you have a<br/>
ranger or druid in the group, and they are doing a consistently good job of<br/>
snaring, you should loet them.  it is superior to chain if they are doing<br/>
their job.  if they are doing poorly, tell them to start doing their job or<br/>
you will do it for them.  i have been in groups with rangers/druids where<br/>
this is done well, and others where it is not.  hell i even forget or don&#39;t<br/>
chain in time because the mob&#39;s health bar is lagged to me.  bottom line: if<br/>
those snaring are doing their job, then snare is better for keeping the mobs<br/>
from running, it lasts longer and is broken out of less.  and yes i have<br/>
gotten my bard past level 23.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hopefully you&#39;ll learn to do otherwise. If you don&#39;t, I can <br/>
&gt; &gt;guarantee you&#39;ll have a very difficult time getting groups <br/>
&gt; &gt;as you advance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, because I disagree with you and then you rattle off a <br/>
&gt; comment like above will make me say this.  I am one of the <br/>
&gt; more popular 2nd wave bards on our server.  No one has ever<br/>
&gt; questioned my tactics, and I have people immediately asking<br/>
&gt; me to join up with them.  Druids and rangers are NOT typically<br/>
&gt; extremely intelligent people, and either like to pure melee<br/>
&gt; or pure burn/heal.  The bard has always been stuck with making<br/>
&gt; many songs work to their advantage, where other classes specialize<br/>
&gt; in one or two areas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Druids don&#39;t group much.  They solo anything they can.<br/>
&gt;    I&#39;ve been in group with druids about 5% of the time I<br/>
&gt;    play EQ.  And half of that 5% was with you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Rangers are melee people.  Their spells are for the extra<br/>
&gt;    utility perks.  They are not the best casters, I often see<br/>
&gt;    the snare spell cast (the green/yellow flying circles) and<br/>
&gt;    almost always see a full resist.  (ie: no snare message)<br/>
&gt;    I don&#39;t have time to wait for the snare to kick in.  I<br/>
&gt;    do not get resisted that often on chains.  I miss more notes,<br/>
&gt;    than I get resists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) In the last two weeks, my steady group DOES NOT have a<br/>
&gt;    druid or ranger.  Tactics change based on the group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...and all this speculation about breaking out of chains,<br/>
&gt; I think you should get your bard to level 23 and then come<br/>
&gt; back to the table, J.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In cazicthule, I can chain blue defenders/sentinels and it lasts<br/>
&gt; the whole battle (~20 secs), without reapplication.  Yellow/Red<br/>
&gt; zealots, judicators... different story... however, once I chain<br/>
&gt; them near the end of the battle - they do not move.  This may<br/>
&gt; takes four or fives resists, but the end goal is to stop runners.<br/>
&gt; And I accomplish this without ANY problems.<br/>
