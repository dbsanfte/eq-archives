&gt; &gt; I would say that having his pet kill him is a pretty jerk thing to do,<br/>
&gt; since that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would cause him to lose experience.  i would hope that people on this<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; &gt; nasty that they would be advocating this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well, exp loss is also not as bad as it once was. I died in the basement<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; /Kurn&#39;s Tower/ *winces at the thought* to a host of very green Bucky<br/>
&gt; Badgers, it took less than an hour at the giant fort in the Frontier<br/>
&gt; Mountains to get that back and then some.  Just a thought, I don&#39;t know<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; it is like at other levels. Another ameliorating factor is that since he<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; in your guild you will be able to make yourself available for his ensuing<br/>
&gt; exp-twinking needs *smile*<br/>
