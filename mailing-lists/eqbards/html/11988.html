<div id="ygrps-yiv-539819244"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you don&#39;t mind my asking, just where the heck do you FIND seven HGs.  <br/>
&gt; In the last four days, I&#39;ve seen exactly three, and one of them was<br/>
&gt; dead.  I have also seen zero Griffons.  The new Gnolls are fully<br/>
&gt; camped, the Spectres have three groups sitting around the lake, <br/>
&gt; Kithicor is (as I predicted) utterly uncamped yet still a killer to<br/>
&gt; move through half the time.  Bah!  I hate being level 35 on an aging and<br/>
&gt; crowded server.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  We&#39;ve got this huge influx of people who want to advance very fast<br/>
  (read: Lazy).  So they hear if you pick a yellow or red creature <br/>
  and kite it around you get tons of exp.  Everyone and their brother<br/>
  is doing that now it seems, not just druids.  I saw a ranger arrow<br/>
  kiting a giant the other day (sheesh that must have been long and<br/>
  boring).  Innoruuk is full of idiots, ugh, what are we going to do?<br/>
