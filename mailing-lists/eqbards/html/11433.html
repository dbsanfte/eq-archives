For the most part on target in my opinion if a bit too pointed.  You are<br/>
mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>
gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>
about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>
songs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic<br/>
instrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the<br/>
instrument.<br/>

Actually, you must either have to have a magic instrument AND magic gloves,<br/>
or just the magic gloves will suffice.  If you have non-magic gauntlets and<br/>
a magic instrument, you still can not punch magic creatures.<br/>
(Coincidentally, when they did the bard punching patch, they also changed<br/>
the INVULNERABLE message to be a &quot;Your Misses&quot; message, instead of a &quot;Your<br/>
Hits&quot; message.  Since I play with &quot;Your Misses&quot; chat turned off (hey, gotta<br/>
keep my ego up), I was no longer getting the INVUL message after they did<br/>
this patch, and was getting frustrated that I couldn&#39;t even get one punch in<br/>
on those froggie ghouls, heh.<br/>
