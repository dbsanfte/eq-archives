<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778837024">he&#39;s a god, shouldn&#39;t he have special powers? =)<br/>
and unless i am wrong, all gods and dragons have 32k hp, they just have<br/>
different powers and hit for more or less than others.  the ghoul lord has<br/>
10000 hp, so i&#39;m sure CT has a bit more.  and 6 or 12 wizards wouldn&#39;t last<br/>
2 seconds.  their nukes won&#39;t all land and they&#39;ll all die in one or two<br/>
attack rounds.  i know you said that this is because of the special powers,<br/>
i&#39;m just talking for the sake of argument/discussion.<br/>
<br/>
along the same lines as melee classes being invaluable, it goes the same for<br/>
others.  every situation needs clerics.  many situations require an<br/>
enchanter.  many situations require a monk.  many require a bard (contrary<br/>
to what some discussion has said, i still don&#39;t think you want to be doing<br/>
dragons without us).  the same can be said of many classes.  that&#39;s balance<br/>
to me.  i guess you are saying this should not be dependent on level, but it<br/>
is, and i don&#39;t know if that is right or wrong.<br/>

p.s. i know john kim is going to say something about hating level-dependent<br/>
systems, don&#39;t let me down ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If it wasn&#39;t for the <br/>
&gt; &#39;special&#39; powers<br/>
&gt; given them, any group of 6 wizards of 49th level could simply <br/>
&gt; walk up to<br/>
&gt; Cazic and Nuke him to oblivion.  He has what 10,000 hps?  10 <br/>
&gt; Ice Comets<br/>
&gt; would do more than that.  Use 2 groups of wizards and it becomes even<br/>
&gt; sillier.  Unless you make these Uber-mobs nigh on immune to <br/>
&gt; magic there<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be any strategy, you cannot give them enough hp&#39;s.<br/>
