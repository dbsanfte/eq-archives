<div id="ygrps-yiv-281367341">I was wondering if any of our loremasters might know where to find Medium<br/>
and High quality wolf pelts.  Are they available anywhere outside of Qeynos<br/>
Hills?  Hunting wolves there is very problematic with Holly and that other<br/>
Ranger guy running about.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about yesterday&#39;s rant, but when multiple people post yelling at me<br/>
not to give Verant any &#39;funny ideas&#39; about taking plate away from bards<br/>
after I clearly stated I don&#39;t care if bards are allowed plate or not,<br/>
pushed me over the edge.<br/>
