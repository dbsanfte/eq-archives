&gt; &gt; Last night in PoA I had one of my guild members ask me to put on my plane<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor so they could take a screen shot (my current look is all black plate).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sadly informed her my only piece of plane equipment (after nearly 2 months<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 46+) is my Six Note Blade.  She was apalled :)<br/>

&gt;   I guess you could go with azure sleeves and bracers that were silver.<br/>
&gt;   Ugh, then I&#39;d look like a freakin dark paladin ;-)<br/>

guild out of bronze, and tossed a bunch of miscellaneous armor<br/>
onto him.  He ended up with a steel BP, steel arms, silver<br/>
plated bracers, charred boots, and black chitin leggings.  He<br/>
looks like he walked out of a tuxedo shop.  He says he&#39;s never<br/>
been inspected so much in his life.  It&#39;s a nice look for<br/>
formal events like weddings, or if you want to avoid the dark<br/>
paladin look.<br/>
