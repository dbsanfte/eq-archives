guild out of bronze, and tossed a bunch of miscellaneous armor<br/>
onto him.  He ended up with a steel BP, steel arms, silver<br/>
plated bracers, charred boots, and black chitin leggings.  He<br/>
looks like he walked out of a tuxedo shop.  He says he&#39;s never<br/>
been inspected so much in his life.  It&#39;s a nice look for<br/>
formal events like weddings, or if you want to avoid the dark<br/>
paladin look.<br/>
