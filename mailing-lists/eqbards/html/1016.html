<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734419363">I agree with you on most of that, and if all the other magic classes turn<br/>
out to be the same, maybe I&#39;ll try a monk or warrior. And alot of the really<br/>
usefull stuff that makes us versatile isnt untill the higher levels.Disarm<br/>
Trap is 30th, Pick locks is 40th, and track is 35th....Maybe I am just<br/>
expecting to much, I dont know<br/>

&gt;Gotta disagree here.  As an enchanter, I generally had a standard &quot;spell<br/>
&gt;kit&quot; that I seldom changed.  As a Bard my song kit is much the same, but as<br/>
&gt;I get more protective songs they will take some precedence.<br/>
&gt;Note one VERY important thing:  We are NOT defined by our songs the way<br/>
&gt;spellcasters are defined by their spells.  We are also middlin-fair<br/>
&gt;warriors (You watch a wiz try to go toe to toe with a fast melee mob and<br/>
&gt;see who&#39;s still standing).  We are also the SINGLE MOST VERSATILE CLASS IN<br/>
&gt;THE GAME.  Read that sentence again.  There is NOTHING we can&#39;t do:  pick<br/>
&gt;locks, disarm traps, put monsters to sleep, heal our party, hide our party,<br/>
&gt;take our party underwater....  Bards in EQ are the single-most powerful<br/>
&gt;Bard class I&#39;ve ever played (and this is from someone who&#39;s played Bard in<br/>
&gt;nearly every conceivable RPG).<br/>
&gt;As has been stated before, we enhance a party.  If you want to convert a<br/>
&gt;Bard to a mathematical formula, where fighters = 1, and spellchuckers = 1,<br/>
&gt;and Clerics = 1, Bards = x2 multiplier.  We make everyone better.<br/>
