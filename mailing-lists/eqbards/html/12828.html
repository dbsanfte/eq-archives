&gt;Brownies can&#39;t see thru invis - the most reliable way to fetch a corpse<br/>
&gt;from the brownie camp is invisible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guards and merchants inside (also rather ugly critters) seem to be<br/>
&gt;different factions - if one of them had seen you, might not have been so<br/>
&gt;lucky. Buying that enchanter spell was a two step process - had to<br/>
&gt;Benevolence the guards - then use minor illusion to go indifferent to the<br/>
&gt;merchant. Least it&#39;s not 3 zones deep into darkie territory like the<br/>
&gt;enchant metal spells in Neriak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t feel too badly bout dying to them tho - I&#39;ve had to help lvl 50<br/>
&gt;friends get their corpses out of there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, actually, I didn&#39;t have a problem with the merchants, either.  After <br/>
I had re-equipped myself, I decided to see just how good this song was, so <br/>
I went back.  The guards were still indifferent, and when I peeked inside, <br/>
so were the merchants.  Maybe that&#39;s changed now - in which case just <br/>
getting to buy from those guys is a quest in itself....<br/>
