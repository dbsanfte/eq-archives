&gt; I too have recently been hunting Aviaks in South K. <br/>
&gt; I have been in several<br/>
&gt; groups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights. <br/>
&gt; While I have never grouped<br/>
&gt; with a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting<br/>
&gt; in a group of 2) with<br/>
&gt; several different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A<br/>
&gt; Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>
&gt; and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have<br/>
&gt; had a problem that I as a<br/>
&gt; bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt<br/>
&gt; Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>
&gt; once I would be the one ending battle with most of<br/>
&gt; my health, while my<br/>
&gt; partner was near death.  This is nice but<br/>
&gt; unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>
&gt; would have a terrible time trying to get my share of<br/>
&gt; dammage.  I think that<br/>
&gt; some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a<br/>
&gt; lot of resists from<br/>
&gt; Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I<br/>
&gt; think that there is some<br/>
&gt; other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a seperate note,  I did group with 2 other bards<br/>
&gt; in unrest once.  WOW...<br/>
&gt; that was cool, and I can attribute not getting all<br/>
&gt; the attention, due to<br/>
&gt; multiple bards.  What fun.  If we had one more bard<br/>
&gt; we could have been the<br/>
&gt; Beatles :)  I also dont think I have ever seen Sooo<br/>
&gt; many icons for Buffs on<br/>
&gt; my screen :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, at the suggestion of a few people from<br/>
&gt; this list, I ventured for<br/>
&gt; the first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I<br/>
&gt; had been in South Karana<br/>
&gt; before to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had<br/>
&gt; never fought anything<br/>
&gt; there.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th<br/>
&gt; level players, four of<br/>
&gt; which were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th<br/>
&gt; level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>
&gt; avoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that<br/>
&gt; she would sing the level<br/>
&gt; 25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and<br/>
&gt; anything else appropriate.<br/>
&gt; We were camping at the top of the village where<br/>
&gt; avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>
&gt; and darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with<br/>
&gt; this group for almost<br/>
&gt; two hours.  Me and the other bard were the default<br/>
&gt; tanks.  For the first<br/>
&gt; time in a long time, I was no longer the center of<br/>
&gt; attention.  In almost<br/>
&gt; every fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get<br/>
&gt; the aviaks initial<br/>
&gt; attention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the<br/>
&gt; aviak, they often found<br/>
&gt; themselves the center of attention.  I, on the other<br/>
&gt; hand, almost never got<br/>
&gt; attacked the entire night.  The most health I ever<br/>
&gt; dropped to was about 50%.<br/>
&gt; This happened when an avocet spawned while we were<br/>
&gt; in the process of<br/>
&gt; fighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots<br/>
&gt; of fun.  The lower<br/>
&gt; level bard also has the luxury of not having to<br/>
&gt; worry too much about getting<br/>
&gt; continually whacked on.  <br/>
