&gt; Of course, playing a bard when your party is mob-chasing is<br/>
&gt; dangerous at best - everything that is not being attacked by<br/>
&gt; the party (and in a good party I believe this will be everything<br/>
&gt; except the ONE creature being attacked) will attack the bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, they really need to tone this down.  I&#39;ve had monsters<br/>
that other people were attacking (people not in my party and<br/>
lower level than me) break off their attack and come attack me<br/>
for simply walking by with Accelerando or Restoration playing.<br/>
When our party got squashed by a wandering sand giant, it hit<br/>
me first instead of the clerics who were sitting and<br/>
meditating.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which is why I think lullaby is so great! :-)  They&#39;re all<br/>
targeting me, but they&#39;re not attacking so who cares.<br/>

I twist in a group simply for the added AC to cut down on the<br/>
amount of damage I take.<br/>
