&gt; Of course, playing a bard when your party is mob-chasing is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, they really need to tone this down.  I&#39;ve had monsters<br/>
that other people were attacking (people not in my party and<br/>
lower level than me) break off their attack and come attack me<br/>
for simply walking by with Accelerando or Restoration playing.<br/>
When our party got squashed by a wandering sand giant, it hit<br/>
me first instead of the clerics who were sitting and<br/>
meditating.<br/>

targeting me, but they&#39;re not attacking so who cares.<br/>

I twist in a group simply for the added AC to cut down on the<br/>
amount of damage I take.<br/>
