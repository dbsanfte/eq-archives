<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601654383">Just out of curiousity,  why did your friend retire his 30th level bard?<br/>
I&#39;ve found leveling a bard (particularly soloing) to be pretty easy, and I&#39;m<br/>
17th level now, but I&#39;ve had this feeling that bards at the higher levels<br/>
don&#39;t quite cut it compared to other classes.  I&#39;ve heard of how great high<br/>
wizards are, and I&#39;ve seen a Necro solo hill giants and griffons with his<br/>
pet, but does anyone know how well high levels bards compare to other<br/>
classes?<br/>
