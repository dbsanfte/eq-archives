I ran into this problem in Kedge and Permafrost.  The mob&#39;s<br/>
eyes would glaze over, then they would finish casting.  In one<br/>
case they happened quickly enough that I think the messages<br/>
were just got to my client out of order.  But in all other<br/>
cases, the Strike hit long before the casting completed, and<br/>
it still had no effect.  I think this is the missing resist<br/>
message at work here, same as for Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, it seems the different effects seem to have<br/>
separate resist checks.  Playing Pixie Strike on myself, I<br/>
will often get the &quot;you send forth music&quot; message - there is<br/>
no stun, but my MR does go down for the duration.<br/>
