&gt;Sorry about posting off-topic but for some reason I have email access but<br/>
&gt;not Internet access. As a result, I can&#39;t post this question on EQVault.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was attacked by <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Spider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never seen this NPC<br/>
&gt;before so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we killed a lot <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;giant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, after we <br/>
&gt;killed<br/>
&gt;her, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  Right-clicking on<br/>
&gt;the item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t mention anything<br/>
&gt;like Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever heard of this<br/>
&gt;item.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking it may be a<br/>
&gt;quest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison sac from the<br/>
&gt;Queen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking like a kidney.<br/>
&gt;My guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used by a rogue to<br/>
&gt;create poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been implemented yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP but if its<br/>
&gt;part of a quest would like to try and solve it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>
&gt;night.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named fairie whose<br/>
&gt;name I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In addition to the<br/>
&gt;Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  There were <br/>
&gt;several<br/>
&gt;groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures.  The general<br/>
&gt;consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these creatures caused<br/>
&gt;Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>
&gt;enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant has started to<br/>
&gt;beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar additions in other<br/>
&gt;zones?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ever since beta Verant has been steadily adding more critters to the various <br/>
zones. In beta 3 there were no monsters (or npc&#39;s) in the East Karanas. They <br/>
stocked it ful of baddies in beta4 taking many travellers by surprise. My <br/>
friend was talking to the npc paladin (forget his name) there one evening, <br/>
and was attacked by a werewolf. He was saved by the paladin, thankfully. <br/>
First time I saw Equestrielle was in beta4, it was a black horse with red <br/>
eyes and no horn, looked kind of like a nightmare(sp?) from AD&D, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t aggressive. Crookstinger is probly about as new as Equestrielle. Not <br/>
sure about the named faerie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking the same thing - they probly spawn the same way the Minotaur <br/>
Hero in Steamfont does, after you&#39;ve killed some of the weaker of their <br/>
race, they want revenge =)<br/>
