<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126725605">I&#39;m almost there... how many thousands of undead frogs have I killed and yet<br/>
the live ones still hold that one little GB incident, more of a<br/>
misunderstanding really, against me! :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow just because I&#39;m curious has anyone tried MMM in Air to see where it<br/>
puts you?  I understand if you fall off an island you end up in the water<br/>
off E FP, but perhaps MMM might reveal a hidden area or maybe let you do<br/>
some out of sequence island hopping.  I&#39;ll test this the first chance I<br/>
get - right after I bank all my gear. =)<br/>
