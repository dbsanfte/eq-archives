<div id="ygrps-yiv-68105918"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I heard of a L40 full group holding the tower on live side.<br/>
&gt;   Anything less than that I think you&#39;d be asking for trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Crown of the Froglok Kings is not dropped at the Live tower. The Froglok <br/>
Crusader and Priest spawn there.  The crown is dropped by the Froglok King <br/>
(who else?!) which is a tough camp. At lvl 40 I&#39;d rather do the tower - <br/>
though King may be doable by a lvl 40 group. Hrm.. I do need to build up my <br/>
50 xp buffer...better hit the throne room!<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the Lambent Helm?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   of the two pieces for this, the opaline helm is carried on<br/>
&gt;   deepwater goblins.  They are much harder than they look.<br/>
&gt;   During Sylly&#39;s event last week, two deepwater goblins were<br/>
&gt;   pulled and Sylly, A level 50 cleric, and myself were almost<br/>
&gt;   slain.  Nasty critters.  Again, if you happened to loot a<br/>
&gt;   helm on the first try when L50s were farting around pulling<br/>
&gt;   the DWs, then you got lucky.  We killed 5 that night, and<br/>
&gt;   saw no helm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Use Charm. =)  Charmed DW Gobs make nice pets. I also find it&#39;s a nice way <br/>
to avoid getting nuked by them. When they start casting and your charm hits <br/>
them their nuke bounces off you harmlessly.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   Which is easiest -&gt; hardest?  (minus the luck factor)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Lambent, Crested, Froglok, in that order I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   HARDEST:<br/>
&gt;   Froglok requires you penetrate a fairly tough dungeon, and<br/>
&gt;   engage in a fairly decent fight with the king and guards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   HARDER:<br/>
&gt;   Crested helm, the Caitliff isn&#39;t hard, he&#39;s just hard to get<br/>
&gt;   to drop the helm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   HARD:<br/>
&gt;   Lambent helm, practice and patience.  No dungeons, easy zone<br/>
&gt;   if things go wrong, most pieces acquirable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic. </span></blockquote></div>
