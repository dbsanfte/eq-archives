<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327077105">The problem with using our Cancel Magic song to remove spell effects is that<br/>
it checks against your MR.  I think, but am not 100% certain, that Cancel<br/>
Magic will always remove the first spell effect.  So if you are rooted, in<br/>
order to get rid of it the root icon needs to be listed first.  Then the<br/>
song has to actually succeed a MR check.  When I want to remove my DE<br/>
illusion, I usually have to try 2-3 times before the song sticks.  <br/>
<br/>
Using Disenchanting Melody to remove root would work OK IF you didn&#39;t have<br/>
any other positive buffs.  It could easily remove one of your cleric buffs<br/>
instead of the root.<br/>

What i was pondering is :<br/>
<br/>
Were we able to remove buffs on ourselves before? except for DE illusion<br/>
which i know we can<br/>

I know Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura works on removing Damage Shields and <br/>
other buffs on mobs as I used it last night in Sol A.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to strip your own enchantments with Alenia&#39;s <br/>
Disenchanting Melody. I know this used to clear my dark elf illusion.<br/>
<br/>
I just logged on and tested it and it worked fine. Did my inkie illusion, <br/>
then started up Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody and it cleared it.<br/>

&gt;Now in the past the only thing i used to dispel on myself was dark elf<br/>
&gt;illusion...  Were we able to dispell our buffs in the past with our song?<br/>
&gt;or has this changed since last patch?  I could not dispell clarity, i tried<br/>
&gt;multiple times, morphed into DE form, was able to dispell that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just curious<br/>
