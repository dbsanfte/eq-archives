<b>Subject:</b> Quick question re: choices of primary & secondary weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913262563">So if I&#39;m using a Combine LS and one of those FUNKY Dvinn&#39;s daggers, I&#39;m <br/>
better off sticking the dagger in my secondary? As it stands I&#39;m doing the <br/>
opposite, cuz I figure since I have a veryfast weapon to play with I&#39;d best <br/>
give it all the chances I can to do as much dmg as possible by using it in <br/>
my primary. I might&#39;ve just confused the issue ;) What I&#39;d love is to stick <br/>
another Dvinn&#39;s dagger in my secondary hand... *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Just had rather a dull session in Mistmoore. The leader of the group I <br/>
joined commanded me to &quot;do just heal and combat song&quot;... which is what I <br/>
did, along with a bellows every few secs. Kinda boring, but effective. It <br/>
led me to thinking: the most efficient way of fighting is to whackum the <br/>
mob as fast as possible. Less damage done to the group, less chances of <br/>
things going wrong... so if one were to stick to the most boring, <br/>
statistically correct methods, most of the bard songs would be pretty <br/>
unused apart from in rare situations. Am I wrong here? Don&#39;t mistake me <br/>
however - although I behaved according to the leader&#39;s desires (didn&#39;t have <br/>
the energy to lead them through the &quot;look at what I can do!&quot; routine) - I&#39;m <br/>
much more fond of doing a wider variety of songs, twisting different <br/>
melodies that enhance and obstruct... far more elegant and poetic, I think, <br/>
not to mention entertaining. Felt like an office drone hitting my hotkeys <br/>
at the right time without having to think about what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
But do folks agree that it&#39;d technically (using Vulcan logic here) be best <br/>
simply to do Anthem with 2 bellows, repeat? This is for me at lvl 20 btw. <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t even heal, leave that for after the battle. The aim is to zap the <br/>
critter as fast as possible from what I&#39;ve seen. And remember - this is <br/>
hypothetical. Why I&#39;ll never deny that sometimes there&#39;s a need and a <br/>
desire to be all efficient about this game, most of the time I&#39;d rather <br/>
have fun even if it involves more risk.<br/>

There are more efficient<br/>
weapons that can be dual wielded, but that efficiency is counterbalanced by<br/>
the higher delay, making them less effective in the secondary.</div>
