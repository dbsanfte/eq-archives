<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977997634">The non-technical term we use for how we kill Nag/Vox is &quot;gimps&quot;. I bring my <br/>
49th Rogue to raids. At least half of the people involved in our raids are <br/>
&lt;53 secondary characters. We almost always have 53+ <br/>
clerics/shamans/enchanters present to buff us, though, and I usually bring <br/>
the bard for pumping mana into the buffing team. You can also use the scales <br/>
from Ragefire if you have any clerics working on their epic quest.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;My guild can&#39;t do Vox or Naggy straight up because almost all of us are <br/>
&gt;above level 52.  I&#39;m curious if<br/>
&gt;anyone can give me some guidance on how level 53+ characters can contribute <br/>
&gt;to a Vox/Naggy raid without<br/>
&gt;being tossed (or with being tossed, if that&#39;s useful).  I don&#39;t understand <br/>
&gt;the mechanics of when someone<br/>
&gt;is tossed and when they aren&#39;t.  We have a couple of small guild allies <br/>
&gt;that we could use as front men.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, does anyone have links to any good information on taking down the <br/>
&gt;Kunark dragons?  We haven&#39;t done<br/>
&gt;any of them yet; everyone keeps saying we have too few high levels (50 over <br/>
&gt;level 53 doesn&#39;t seem that<br/>
&gt;weak to me, but what do I know?  We have about 5 level 60s now.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m never getting this epic weapon, we have too many warriors, and two <br/>
&gt;Bards in front of me.  But it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;nice to dream.<br/>
