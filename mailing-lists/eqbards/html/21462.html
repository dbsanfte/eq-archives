<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851489926">Since it seemed no one was wanting to take the bull by the horns and get this thing rolling, I tossed this post up at the Concert Hall:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, how&#39;s this...<br/>
Saturday evenings from 9PM CST til whenever you feel like leaving?<br/>
Although the idea of holding it in Kelethin (for the size of the zone) was bandied about, I am still in favor going from the gates of Qeynos to the campfire at the Surefall Glade entrance.<br/>
Why? Glad you asked  <br/>
A. Fewer folks than in Kelethin (at least on The Rathe)<br/>
B. With the fewer folks, a lot of the other folks in the two zones we were in NOTICED the large number of bards (anything over 3) when doing /who.<br/>
C. Less wandering MOBs to deal with.<br/>
D. Can see farther  <br/>
E. No &quot;E&quot;, but I just couldn&#39;t resist  <br/>
<br/>
To give enough time for the news sites to get the info and post it (not to mention word-of-mouth), how about starting things off on the first server (alphabeticly) not this Saturday, but the next one?<br/>
