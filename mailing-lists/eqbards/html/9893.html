leader.  The systems we use most are FFA, and a homebrewed<br/>
system.  I loot all the coin and split it as we go, if there&#39;s<br/>
an item I give it to people in alpha order making sure each<br/>
person gets about a FS weapon&#39;s value in items before going<br/>
on.  The coin splitting is a bit tricky since it requires I<br/>
wait until I get an amount of coin that&#39;s divisible by the<br/>
number of group members and add any remainder to subsequent<br/>
loots, but then math has always been a strong point with me.  <br/>
:-)  I usually split coins every 2-3 mobs, so it&#39;s difficult<br/>
to &quot;miss out&quot; due to never getting to your turn.  We destroy<br/>
all silver and copper too unless someone wants it.<br/>
<br/>
This requires everyone to trust the looter, but it&#39;s worked<br/>
pretty well.  We&#39;ve had 4 hour playsessions and by the end<br/>
everyone was within 2-3 plat of me (mostly roundoff errors -<br/>
if I&#39;m in a 6 person group and have looted 4pp and 17gp, I&#39;ll<br/>
just go ahead and split 6 pp).  The only complaint I had was<br/>
from someone who said he liked the thrill of looting a kill<br/>
himself and the uncertainty of knowing what it had.  OTOH,<br/>
several people actually like being relieved of the burden of<br/>
having to loot coin and destroying the silver and copper.<br/>
