<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038600370">I&#39;m only level 20, so I don&#39;t have any experience with this, but could the<br/>
MR debuff effect of the level 39 charm song explain how you finally got<br/>
charm to stick?  Sounds like something to test anyway since you couldn&#39;t get<br/>
the charm to stick until the level 51 bard charmed the knight first.<br/>

Ok, I pulled my log from last night and checked...  I actually had 8<br/>
charm resists (long enough for our cleric to die) in a row before the<br/>
level 51 bard in our party charmed the Spectral Knight for the first<br/>
time.  After her charm broke, she charmed it again and when that broke<br/>
I was able to take control of it and sit it by the castle as we moved<br/>
to zone.  After that she charmed it 3 or 4 more times while people<br/>
made their way to zone and then I charmed it once as she made her way<br/>
out this time with no resist.  Definately a con yellow at level 50<br/>
too, and the other bard said it conned white to her at level 51.  I<br/>
got summoned by the Knight first and then the cleric second, probably<br/>
from healing me which was his death sentence.<br/>
<br/>
The level 51 bard barely got resisted by the Knight where as I started<br/>
with 8 in a row (I almost never get resisted...).  Don&#39;t know for sure<br/>
if the resists were level dependent or if it was because of the<br/>
infamous Verant semi-random number generator.<br/>
