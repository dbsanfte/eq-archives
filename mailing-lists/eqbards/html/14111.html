<b>Subject:</b> RE: Ok I need advice... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207266022">Ok, I&#39;ll start something... I think of you all as friends<br/>
and could really use some advice.  Its not bard related (well there was a<br/>
bard there!) but I could really use some input...<br/>
<br/>
		Last night....  Got invited to a Plane of Sky trip - my<br/>
first trip to the planes.  It was not a guild trip but a bunch of people<br/>
just going.  Everything went surprisingly well - we had 4 groups and few<br/>
deaths considering we had never fought together before.  We cleared out<br/>
everything and were on the last kill of the night, the Heart Harpie I think<br/>
it is.  The group I was in actually got the kill (2 druid, me (shaman) and a<br/>
paladin if you can believe that).  <br/>
<br/>
		Well we all sit down to med, and the rest of the group is<br/>
OOC-ing for us to &quot;shout out the loot&quot;.  I hardly ever loot so I was<br/>
expecting someone else (i.e. my group leader) to do this.  Well nobody in<br/>
our group did right away - I don&#39;t think.  The rest of the group kept<br/>
shouting to tell them the loot was so I finally got up and looted the<br/>
corpse.  All that was on it was an animal figurine - basically nothing.  And<br/>
this was supposed to have the big loot of the night.<br/>
<br/>
		Immediately, several of the people started making loot<br/>
stealing accusations.  And these were not calm and collected but ranting and<br/>
raving of the type I haven&#39;t seen since 8th grade.  It was frankly quite<br/>
awful.  I don&#39;t know many of these people well so I can see where they don&#39;t<br/>
have proof of my honesty but the extent to which they carried on and accused<br/>
was unbelievable.   The fact that seemed to condemn me the most was that it<br/>
took &quot;too long&quot; (i.e. 1 minute) for me to announce the loot... <br/>
<br/>
		I have no way of knowing if I was the first to loot the<br/>
corpse or not.  So perhaps there was something on it that someone else in my<br/>
group stole - but I honestly doubt it.  <br/>
<br/>
		So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>
set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
you?  <br/>
