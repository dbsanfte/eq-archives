<div id="ygrps-yiv-598252741">A 53 SK and 52 Shaman MIGHT be able to kill the hunter/forager, but it will<br/>
be very tough.  You as a 35 bard will not be contributing very much to the<br/>
fight so it will be up to the two of them.  My regular group when I did the<br/>
hunter/forager cycle consisted of me at 47, another bard 50th level, 49<br/>
cleric, 55 warrior and a 50 enchanter.  One of the bards would track and<br/>
pull the hunter/forager.  Once we brought it back to camp, one bard would do<br/>
nothing but chains/fear the entire fight.  Even though we got chains/fear to<br/>
stick most of the time, if the cleric had not been there, the warrior<br/>
probably would have died since he took a lot of damage in between fearing.<br/>
Your SK can darkness/fear, but the shaman might not be able to keep the SK<br/>
healed up when fear breaks. With the group combo I listed, it would take us<br/>
a couple of minutes to kill the mob.  With your group, it will take even<br/>
longer, even if the SK and shaman summon pets.  IMO, you need a couple more<br/>
45+ folks to do the hunter/forager.  With the extra folks, you would also be<br/>
able to kill some of the named mobs if they happen to appear.  With just the<br/>
shaman and SK, you won&#39;t be able to take on any named mob, which are all<br/>
higher level than than the hunter/forager.      <br/>
<br/>
BTW unless you are extremely lucky, the hunter or forager will not show up<br/>
on track when you zone in.  If thats the case, you will have to run<br/>
thoughout the zone to find them.  If you get lucky, they will show up on<br/>
track further in the zone.  If you get unlucky, you will have to manually<br/>
look for them by left clicking on mobs to target them (there are a ton of<br/>
frogloks in the zone so the hunter/forager are easy to miss).  One time my<br/>
group had finished doing the forager cycle so we moved over to start looking<br/>
for the hunter so we could complete the key quest.  No one else was in TT<br/>
hunting them so I knew the hunter was out there somewhere.  I ran around for<br/>
15 minutes or so and never found him.  No matter where I was at in the zone,<br/>
the hunter never appeared on track (no named mobs either).  Suddenly out of<br/>
the blue the hunter attacked me.  While taking him back to the group, I hit<br/>
track.  Even though he was right behind me, the hunter still did not show up<br/>
on track.  The reason he didn&#39;t show up on track even though he was right<br/>
next to me was because there were 20 other mobs within tracking range who<br/>
had spawned after he did.  Bottom line is that it can be a pain in the arse<br/>
to find the hunter/forager if they don&#39;t immediately show up on track. <br/>

Well it will be me 35 bard, Shaman 53 and Sk 52 (told you I was helping out<br/>
higher levels) so I am not sure how much of a problem it will be for<br/>
wandering<br/>
mobs etc. They may bring more people and I get to be the<br/>
manabattery/tracker/magic resist buffer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info so far everyone.<br/>

There are, in essence, two &quot;lines&quot; with the hunter and forager and they are,<br/>
indeed, instant spawns.  I believe Druid tracking is the best as it is<br/>
refreshed more often... Each of the lines has a variety of other named<br/>
spawns that can take the place of the Hunter or Forager.  I have heard that<br/>
it is great xp and loot to get ONE of the lines and just keep following<br/>
it... havign your puller constantly moving.<br/>

&gt; They spawn near the lake and it seems hit or miss finding<br/>
&gt; them. This weekend<br/>
&gt; we had 2 rangers (51 and 52) and a 51 bard running around<br/>
&gt; searchlighting<br/>
&gt; with tracking and we couldn&#39;t find them. Usually they spawn<br/>
&gt; instantly after<br/>
&gt; the last is killed, maybe there was a mundane placeholder.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me any advice or point me to a resource for<br/>
&gt; finding the<br/>
&gt; Froglock<br/>
&gt; &gt; Forager and Froglock Hunter in Trak&#39;s Teeth?  Two of my higher level<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to use my tracking and attempt to find them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any information would be much appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
