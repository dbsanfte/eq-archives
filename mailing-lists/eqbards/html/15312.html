<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543665452">First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all everyday. =D<br/>
<br/>
  I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.  I may not<br/>
  play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>
  I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>
  my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>
  endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>
  the game came before she did in all cases.  <br/>
<br/>
  Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>
  it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>
  have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with <br/>
  that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>
  shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get <br/>
  &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>
<br/>
  I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>
  right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>
  caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>
  post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>
  time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding <br/>
  more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return and play the<br/>
  length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in <br/>
  a few more weeks.<br/>
