<div id="ygrps-yiv-118629516">Not certain if this is the same problem you were having but the other night<br/>
I was getting chased by a sarnak and had Selos up with a MM drum equipped.<br/>
I got the message that I was moving faster but the sarnak kept attacking me.<br/>
Ten seconds or so went by and I was still getting attacked.  I switched out<br/>
of first person view and saw that the sarnak was right on my tail.  Under<br/>
normal situations I should have been pulling away from the mob.  I then<br/>
started to go LD and eventually got disconnected.  When I logged back in I<br/>
was naked at my bind point.  I attributed Selos not working with the<br/>
horrendous lag I was having at the time.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Selos/SoW problems?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to hear reports of problems with SoW that have been bugging me<br/>
for a while now with Selos but I have not been certain it wasn&#39;t just a<br/>
perception thing. At times I check to make sure I am using a mistmoore drum,<br/>
or am singing the correct song, or maybe it&#39;s a perspective thing (like when<br/>
levitating) or even I got left on walk after /following. But I think there<br/>
may be some client vs. server issues with speed you are supposed to be going<br/>
at and speed you actually are. Has anyone else noticed anything?<br/>
