<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015424522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; 1)  It&#39;s a lot more than &quot;A couple pulses&quot;.  Typically it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;about 2 entire twists (30 seconds or so) before I get mobbed.<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2)  We have far more AC than an enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt; 3)  We have far more HP than an enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt; 4)  We have far more melee ability than an enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt; 5)  We have higher dodge skill than an enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt; 6)  We can cast while being hit (an enchanter cannot)<br/>
&gt;&gt; 7)  We can outrun anything that comes near us (outdoor) they cannot.<br/>
&gt;&gt; (technically we can indoors too if you use jig and jump the whole way)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;1)  I usually get jumped before we even have time to realize there<br/>
&gt;are more, and react; sometimes I get as many as 3 pulses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And i know bards that don&#39;t get mobbed at all. This seems to be entirely<br/>
style/location dependent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2-5)  Exactly my point.  The poster stated that we had different ways to<br/>
&gt;handle the mobs, outside of AC, and then used an Enchanter as an<br/>
&gt;example.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No I stated that you said you needed AC because you were always getting<br/>
hit, and that Verant obviously doesn&#39;t take that view. Because the Enchanter<br/>
can get mobbed just as badly, and has way less AC.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was pointing out that the Enchanter has the tools necessary that mitigate<br/>
&gt;the need for AC under these particular circumstances.  We have been able to<br/>
&gt;wear steel class armor for this reason since at least release; the game<br/>
&gt;mechanics have not changed in regards to the bard getting jumped in a<br/>
&gt;multi-mob scenario.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanters and Bards BOTH have tools to mitigate the need for AC. Frankly,<br/>
I&#39;m not asking that Enchanters be given more AC. That&#39;s one of the drawbacks<br/>
of playing a pure caster. Just like it is a drawback of bards that, as you<br/>
go up in level, you become less and less able to really tank -- taking the<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6) Rune.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To begin with, at least up to my level, we get enough Rune to absorb ONE<br/>
blow from<br/>
an enemy (perhaps two. Depending on its level relative to you) And if you&#39;re<br/>
trying to cast mez, you&#39;re certainly not going to waste time Rune&#39;ing<br/>
yourself<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Rune doesn&#39;t stop stunning. And doens&#39;t allow you to cast while<br/>
being<br/>
hit (People keep saying &quot;Cast this on the cleric so they cast through while<br/>
being<br/>
mobbed. It doesn&#39;t work that way.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;7) At my level, the only time the enchanter can&#39;t outrun the<br/>
&gt;outdoors mob is if there is no druid, ranger, or shaman in the group,<br/>
&gt;or the mob can keep pace with SoW.  If they want it, it&#39;s rather easy<br/>
&gt;for an enchanter at my level to have JBoots, as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At my level, rangers don&#39;t have SoW, Shamans can be hard to find, and I<br/>
really do get into groups<br/>
without druids sometime. And bard song is a LOT faster than SoW to begin<br/>
with.<br/>
Even at lower levels you can tell this difference.<br/>
<br/>
(However, for the most part, if someone is beating on me, I stand and hope<br/>
for a<br/>
heal/die. Running is not that effective unless the group has called for a<br/>
&quot;Flee&quot;<br/>
and running just makes the job of the tanks/clerics more difficult in<br/>
getting them off of you. I will back off a couple of paces after something<br/>
tauntish has been done. To see if its still on me. But I don&#39;t try<br/>
outrunning.<br/>
Its not effective enough often enough. And can easily get other stuff on<br/>
ya.)</div>
