<div id="ygrps-yiv-405446171">Life in here again.  :)  Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
How do you determine what weapon to put in what hand, for best results?  I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen this come up in a looong time, and until recently, it has been<br/>
a no brainer for me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
But, for a while, I had an 8/24 and a 6/19, and I assumed the 8/24 was best<br/>
in the primary hand, but someone said it might be better to have the 6/19 in<br/>
primary.<br/>
<br/>
Well, now I have an 11/23 and a 12/26.  Initially, I&#39;d put the 11/23 in<br/>
primary, since it&#39;s faster, but..well, I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Atonal the slow<br/>
Would you believe 45!  :)</div>
