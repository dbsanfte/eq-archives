Guys, this one ain&#39;t gonna fly.  One of the big<br/>
complaints about UO (from a designer&#39;s standpoint) was<br/>
people recalling from the bank to the hunting grounds,<br/>
fighting until full of loot, recalling to the bank,<br/>
selling and dropping stuff off, then recalling bank. <br/>
While it was convenient, it destroyed most of the<br/>
immersion factor of the game by eliminating the<br/>
travel component.  Verant has been very careful to<br/>
avoid this (why none of the teleport points are in or<br/>
very near high level hunting grounds, PoH and PoS<br/>
excepted since it costs money to teleport to them). <br/>
They&#39;re not going to give us a song that lets us do<br/>
it.<br/>

I am curious John, is this the only problem you see<br/>
with this song?  What about the song the way it was<br/>
originally stated with &quot;in zone&quot; party members only?<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that this teleport song treads on other<br/>
classes, but we already have the Mell. Motion song.<br/>
This is basically just the opposite of that song, so I<br/>
am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I have lurked on this for a long while and you seem to<br/>
always think of things or problems that I overlook.  I<br/>
am highly curious as to what you think of the original<br/>
idea.<br/>
