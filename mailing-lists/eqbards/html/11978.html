&gt; 	If you want something akin to the BBK then I have three words for you<br/>
&gt; instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Kicsh Der Pavs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Got one last night and it is a very nice blade. Stats are 10/38 (bit<br/>
&gt; slower<br/>
&gt; than the BBK). Weight is 8.0 (bit lighter than the BBK). Gives you DEX +5.<br/>
&gt; Procs for Strong Poison. 30 DD and 14 per tick (dunno duration). With some<br/>
&gt; help you should be able to go an get it from Paws.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey<br/>

&gt; Well I think I am getting tired of my measly well balanced long sword,and I<br/>
&gt; think its time for a new slasher :)<br/>
&gt; I was thinking of the Brazen Brass Kilij and was wondering-how common is the<br/>
&gt; sand giant with the plans for this quest-is he camped?<br/>
&gt; Can he be camped?<br/>
&gt; I hate to say, I have been in high keep so long,I forget what the rest of<br/>
&gt; the world is like(blinks in the sunlight as he steps outside the keep).<br/>
&gt; I never really hunted much in Ro-went to Guk for the first time last<br/>
&gt; eek( pretty sad for my level)-never been to CT,or MM. Yes I&#39;ve led a very<br/>
&gt; sheltered life-but back to my original question-any help would be<br/>
&gt; appreciated- or is there a better weapon out there i should look for-I dont<br/>
&gt; get alot of  play time-most I can play at one stretch is maybe 3-4 hours on<br/>
&gt; a night when the little woman is asleep :)- so I cant really do a 10 hour +<br/>
&gt; marathon.<br/>
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated. By the way, this is gotta be the best<br/>
&gt; list out there :)-Thanks in advance.<br/>
