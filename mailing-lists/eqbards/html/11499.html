<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Song: Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation (47th Level)<br/>
&gt; Skill: Stringed Instruments<br/>
&gt; Effects: Strength: 10<br/>
&gt; Protective Skin: 10<br/>
&gt; Healing/Damage: 1<br/>
&gt; Max HP: 25<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do we know that it is a 10 dmg shield?? It could last 10 seconds, or<br/>
absorb 10 hits.<br/>
To me it looks like a multiple use song like what you people was suggesting<br/>
our songs should be like.<br/>
<br/>
It gives a Str buff, a protective skin (not sure on effect), to me it looks<br/>
as though it heals 1 point of dmg and dmg&#39;s the enemy with 1 point of dmg<br/>
per tick. Kind of like a life tap spell. Not sure about the last bit<br/>
though, might be that it gives bonus hp&#39;s to a max of 25 (skin like wood<br/>
buff sorta thing.<br/>
All these details are very vague, best wait for it to be properly tested.<br/>

PS Did a lava corpse recovery last night, dumb monk&#39;s first visit in the<br/>
zone and he falls in the lava and dies, I can&#39;t locate the corpse till he<br/>
gets back so I wait, when he gets back I tell him to follow me but be<br/>
carefull and watch your step, what does he do? He falls in again, lucky my<br/>
group could levitate him and he got out, and I got his corpse so he was ok.<br/>

Still though, if you&#39;re fighting more than 1 monster, you better have<br/>
more than 1 healer.  An optimistic number would be 30 damage saved by<br/>
using this song.  How much mana does 1 tick of manasong regen?<br/>
<br/>
It just sounds like a disappointingly low effect for a level 47 song.<br/>

&gt; Remember though this effect the entire party, not just one person.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I would assume it would reduce any attack by 10 damage also?  Still<br/>
&gt; &gt;sounds questionable as one more pulse of mana song would give the cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;more than enough mana to heal 10 damage?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just a lowly level 27 bard.<br/>
