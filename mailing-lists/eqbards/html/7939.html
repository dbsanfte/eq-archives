&gt; I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember <br/>
&gt; this is my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ <br/>
&gt; for about 2 months now, so many of these comcepts are still <br/>
&gt; new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I have read <br/>
&gt; the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a <br/>
&gt; very high level player, I did not understand the EXP share <br/>
&gt; problem. He just asked me to keep singing my heal song and he <br/>
&gt; would look after me, I grouped with him for several hours and <br/>
&gt; didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he said <br/>
&gt; he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told <br/>
&gt; him I needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he <br/>
&gt; had some stuff for me and initiated a trade. I asked my <br/>
&gt; friend via tell if I should accept and he said yes as I earnt <br/>
&gt; it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair <br/>
&gt; of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good <br/>
&gt; (I could see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he <br/>
&gt; said they were, too good for my level. I have banked them for <br/>
&gt; now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear them/sell <br/>
&gt; them or give them away. I have no problem with twinking but <br/>
&gt; dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an <br/>
&gt; opinion on what I should!<br/>
&gt;  do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regards<br/>
