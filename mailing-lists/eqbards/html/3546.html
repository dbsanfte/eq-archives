<div id="ygrps-yiv-736094763">This reminds me of a funny story...<br/>
<br/>
My necromancer is, well, evil.  I enjoy playing him as having a vengeful<br/>
side, though not really as a bad person.  The reason he kills Sisters of<br/>
Erollisi is that they would kill him if he didn&#39;t, simple as that.  That<br/>
being said, he does enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the story...<br/>
<br/>
After killing many a Sister of Erollisi, I went to Freeport to sell off<br/>
my booty.  As always, the market for the belts was very brisk.  One of<br/>
my customers was a wood elf druid, who had her roleplay switch on.<br/>
After we made our transaction, she walked away, and then said, in a<br/>
/tell, &quot;So how do you come by these belts?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thinking that this was just a casual request, and not being one to hold<br/>
back this information, I sent a /tell back saying, &quot;You get them from<br/>
the Ocean of Tears.  I doubt you would want to try and get them yourself<br/>
though, because you have to kill wood elves to get them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, I was beseiged by /tells from this character along the lines<br/>
of &quot;You killed my sisters to get these belts?  Thou art an evil swine to<br/>
profit by the death of such goodliness!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on for a while, and then I finally sent back, &quot;You know...<br/>
/tell is not an in character method of communication.  If I had known<br/>
you were asking in a roleplaying sense, I wouldn&#39;t have told you dead<br/>
wood elves were involved&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To which she replied, &quot;Spin me no more lies evil one, my mind will not<br/>
be clouded by your tales of deceit!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Finally I just gave in and taunted her back in a roleplaying sense.  She<br/>
then followed me around from zone to zone, admonishing players not to<br/>
buy the belts from me, for they had come from the evil slaying of good<br/>
wood elves.<br/>
<br/>
The best part was, it did wonders for my business.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My bard is my #1 character, but it is really fun being evil sometimes.<br/>

&gt; In the name of Erollisi I hope there is another way to get these than<br/>
&gt; by killing one of the sisters.  I feel dirty at even the thought that<br/>
&gt; there are Necromancers hunting sisters for there pelts, I mean belts.<br/>
&gt; I guess I will have to make a pilgrimage to that island and cast my<br/>
&gt; belt into the sea.  I have much pennance to do for profitting by the<br/>
&gt; death of such an unfortunate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Good thing I&#39;m not on the pvp server or I&#39;d spend all my time<br/>
&gt; dying while trying to prevent people from killing the poor little<br/>
&gt; sisters.  come to think of it that&#39;s why I&#39;m not on the pvp server.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be spending all my time dying trying to protect all the good<br/>
&gt; people getting killed by other supposedly good people.  Nothing like<br/>
&gt; watching a paladin slaughtering stonecarvers in Butcherblock, asking<br/>
&gt; him what he&#39;s doing, and having him respond, &quot;They&#39;re the only thing<br/>
&gt; in BB that gives me xp, and I can kill them while waiting for the<br/>
&gt; boat.&quot;  If that isn&#39;t bad enough, he was in /roleplaying mode!  Some<br/>
&gt; people will never get it.<br/>
