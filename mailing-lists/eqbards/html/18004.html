<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408284228">Just wanted to add a couple of things.. And reiterate<br/>
what Sylly said about chasing down the fleeing mobs...<br/>
BE SURE LARGOS (or DDD .. or COD) is OFF!!!!  I dont<br/>
know how many deaths ive had to that bit of<br/>
foolishness on my part.  The other thing is that since<br/>
the lowered agro of our songs, I can use all<br/>
instrument attack (hymn, cod, ddd) in there just fine<br/>
with out a healer.  I use the instruments then for<br/>
maximum hymn benefits, and as long as I have my<br/>
mandolin out, I can also feel useful with CoD, and<br/>
DDD.<br/>
<br/>
Ive spent many hours in there with no healer and it<br/>
can be done.  The only bad combination Ive seen is 3<br/>
bards, and no other melee.  <br/>
<br/>
I love HK, because, as you said no long corpse<br/>
retrieval runs, relatively safe, and really good xp. <br/>
The downside is that if you get on in prime time (on<br/>
bristlebane anyway) expect to wait at least an hour<br/>
and often two for a group.  One saturday night, I got<br/>
a tell five (yes 5) hours later saying my name was up.<br/>
 Needless to say, I had found a group at aviaks by<br/>
then.<br/>
