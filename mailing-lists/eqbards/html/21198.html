<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617251679">I&#39;m gonna apologize, Lyrnia, because in the context it was an <br/>
insensitive comment.  My comment wasn&#39;t really directed at you in <br/>
particular but in general when I see people post &quot;Blah Blah since <br/>
Beta 1&quot; as part of their sig line, it usually comes when they&#39;re <br/>
contradicting someone else&#39;s opinion... To me, it seems like they&#39;re <br/>
saying, &quot;I&#39;ve been around longer than you, so I know.&quot;  I really <br/>
don&#39;t buy into that philosophy and personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s <br/>
anything more special about a Level 60 Bard compared to a Level 25 <br/>
Bard.  Or someone who&#39;s been playing since 4000 BC vs. someone who <br/>
bought the game yesterday.  Obviously, not everyone who uses a <br/>
similar sig is implying the same thing and that&#39;s where some more <br/>
information would have been important to illustrate what I meant.  <br/>
Sorry for what looked like a cheap shot.<br/>
