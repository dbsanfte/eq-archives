<div id="ygrps-yiv-184283768">Sylly and I ran into each other yesterday in the Karanas (I still have the<br/>
bruise) and I was privileged to accompany her on a mission to E Commons.<br/>
Among the discoveries made that day (one being that a 14th song Bard is<br/>
pathetically slow compared to a 31 with a Mistmoore Battle Drum - thanks for<br/>
scarring me for life, Sylly!) was that her Accelerando cancelled mine if we<br/>
were both playing it. The higher level song apparently takes over, which was<br/>
a good thing in this case, otherwise she&#39;d still be waiting for me. I left<br/>
mine on to test, and when we got out of range, I got the message &quot;You Slow<br/>
Down&quot;. And indeed I did slow down to normal running speed, no boot icon<br/>
displayed, even though I was still singing my Selo&#39;s. We were out of range<br/>
for several seconds one time and my Selo&#39;s never kicked in. Now, if I was<br/>
playing something else and switched to Selo&#39;s it would activate if I wasn&#39;t<br/>
in her range. So my conclusion is that the weaker song is cancelled until<br/>
the next time it is started outside the stronger singer&#39;s range. If it is<br/>
true, I suspect that other Bard songs probably don&#39;t stack, either, like the<br/>
heal song. Anyone else test this?<br/>

p.s. The best experience was gliding up the Highpass ramp in E Karanas, me<br/>
playing Selo&#39;s, Sylly levitating us with Aria. Nice to have a taste of the<br/>
future, if only for a little while. Thanks, Sylly!</div>
