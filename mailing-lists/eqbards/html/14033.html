<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-37445787">does it bother anyone else that our drum still appears as a flute when<br/>
equipped?  i know this is only an aesthetic fix and not gameplay<br/>
important, but it cant be that hard.  not that big a deal, but i would<br/>
like to see it done.<br/>

Goaltending is a normal job.  Sure!  How would you like it in your job if every time you made a small mistake, a red light went on over your desk and fifteen thousand people stood up and yelled at you?<br/>
