<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739210124">No you are not crazy, i did this for my entire EQ life until two days ago.<br/>
i wore a full set of rubicite for looks (minus appalling helm of course),<br/>
even though i had mithril bracers and chest, serpentine bracers, elf-hide<br/>
gloves, dwarven work boots, etc.  well finally the stats on the armor in<br/>
Fear have finally won me over.  So all i need is the BP to start looking<br/>
great again.  for now it is rubi gloves, serpentine bracers, azure sleeves,<br/>
rubi BP, and imbrued (yellow armor from fear) boots and legs.  one i get the<br/>
yellow bp and get some elf-hide gloves back i can be happy with my looks<br/>
again.  not quite sure how badly the rubi and yellow clash.<br/>
