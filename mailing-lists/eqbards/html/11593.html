&gt; &gt; Yes you may get the occasional butthead with money to burn who will throw<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100pp+, but I think these people are few and far between-hang in there, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; make friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think its fair at all to call someone a butthead because they can<br/>
&gt; pay more for items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pay what you want, lambent stones sell for 3pp in the shop.  It is<br/>
&gt; a major waste of my wizard&#39;s time to sell these for 10-20pp to people,<br/>
&gt; when the average HG drops 30pp, why waste 10 minutes moving through zones<br/>
&gt; trying to sell for only 7-17pp gain, I could just kill another HG.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is also a waste of your time to not sell one, kill a hill<br/>
giant, and find another one that you can&#39;t loot because they<br/>
are lore.  Somewhere therin, there is a balance which is the<br/>
appropriate selling price.  These things are nowhere near rare<br/>
enought to warrant 100pp.  My guild is currently chock full of<br/>
them.  I&#39;ve already gotten all the lambent stones I need<br/>
(hint: if you convert them to the appropriate lambent gem<br/>
stone, you can loot another lambent stone), and I wish people<br/>
would just stop asking me if I need any more.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You have to remember, people that are looting lambent stones are usually<br/>
&gt; level 30-45, and most of them don&#39;t consider it worth their time<br/>
&gt; to sell an item to a player for 20pp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consider that lambent stones drop at 25x the frequency (my<br/>
estimate) of black pearls.  Consider that black pearls sell<br/>
for 100-200pp.  Consider that black pearls are not no-drop so<br/>
you can hoard them until you find a buyer willing to pay a<br/>
high price.  Why on earth would you expect to get an<br/>
equivalent price for a lambent stone?<br/>
