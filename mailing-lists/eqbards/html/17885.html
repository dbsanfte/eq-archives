<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109999982">Obsidian Shard (and the Obsidian Flamberge) both have the &quot;Obsidian Shatter&quot;<br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
The Obsidian Shatter Effect has these properties:<br/>
1)  DD 30 DMG<br/>
2)  DEBUFF:  -10 AC for approximately 6 heartbeats (Tics)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a DoT, but it is a Debuff.  Therefore you will get the message that<br/>
it wore off.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Shard procs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Saturday night, my guild held a promo/FFA event for our members and<br/>
recruits in the Arena (the zone).  All folks engaging in the event were told<br/>
to un-mem any DoT spells/songs, and leave any weapons that proc DoT&#39;s either<br/>
in the bank, or unequipped.  Seeing as I was the organizer, I left my<br/>
beloved Kisch in the bank (-=sigh!=-) and whooped out the ol&#39; Obsidian<br/>
Shard.  The Shard (from all I have read is SUPPOSEDLY a simple 30pt DD proc.<br/>
right?  Well, imagine my suprise when a few ticks (not sure hopw many) after<br/>
it procs, I get the old &quot;The Obsidian Shatter effect has worn off&quot; message.<br/>
Question:  Was there an update to this weapon that I missed?  (haven&#39;t used<br/>
it in over a month)<br/>
&gt; btw... No matter what Abashi says, Necro and Bard fears STILL work in the<br/>
Arena&#39;s PvP zone, and in a Duel(he even replied to a post of mine about it<br/>
saying they disabled it).<br/>
