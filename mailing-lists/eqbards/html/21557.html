<div id="ygrps-yiv-622391529">Sounds like you might be able to set up some weaving via the social keys <br/>
with this new &quot;pause&quot; command. It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Pauses in Socials*<br/>
<br/>
You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause <br/>
takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number <br/>
of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>
<br/>
For example, a social consisting of:<br/>
<br/>
/sit off<br/>
/cast 1<br/>
/pause 100<br/>
/sit on<br/>
<br/>
...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds <br/>
after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as <br/>
another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the <br/>
pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the <br/>
same line.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
/sit off<br/>
/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>
/sit on<br/>
<br/>
...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to <br/>
note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from <br/>
another, and MUST be specified first on the line.</div>
