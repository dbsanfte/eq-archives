<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165806832">I&#39;ve heard that they have reduced the effect of this song, but can not say<br/>
for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it is designed to allow you to walk into a group of mobs and make<br/>
some of them ignore you for at least one round, unless they resist.  It&#39;s<br/>
also supposed to make them forget that they are mad at you, and you should<br/>
be able to go on your merry way.<br/>
<br/>
However what I have found is that if you are fighting with a group of mages,<br/>
as soon as the mage does more damage than anyone else in the party, the mob<br/>
tends to immediately attack the mage.  With this song going, the mob forgets<br/>
the amount of damage that the player has done to it.  This does seem to<br/>
work, as I have saved our Enchanters butt on many occasions, he&#39;ll fire off<br/>
a chaotic feedback and suddenly the mob is on him.  I sing the song, walk up<br/>
and smack it with my dwarven axes and it&#39;s back on me.  But it also seems to<br/>
work as kind of a taunt skill.  If the mob resists the song, it enrages the<br/>
mob and it will usually turn on you and start attacking you.<br/>
<br/>
If you are soloing and you get jumped by a creature that is way over your<br/>
head, I usually kick on run song, get going, then switch to this song, if<br/>
the creature doesn&#39;t resist, then it will stop and seem to sleep for about 1<br/>
round, this usually gives you enough distance to get away.  If the mob is a<br/>
spell caster, sometimes, if your lucky, you can get far enough ahead of the<br/>
mob that it won&#39;t be able to cast on you.<br/>
<br/>
This strategy doesn&#39;t always work, but the times it didn&#39;t, there was no<br/>
other option except to die.  So either way I was going to die, it just might<br/>
save your butt.<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly if you are at the entrance to a dungeon and someone trains a mob<br/>
of monsters on you, sometimes you can play this long enough to get away from<br/>
the train.  Again, not always.....<br/>
<br/>
From what I had heard, it used to have an indefinate number of mobs that it<br/>
would affect, now supposedly it only affects 4.  So far the most mobs on me<br/>
at once has only been 4, so I can&#39;t confirm or deny this rumor.<br/>
<br/>
The most important rule is tho, do not play it around NPC&#39;s, i.e. Vendors,<br/>
Guards, etc.  As it will affect them, it&#39;s an area effect spell, so if they<br/>
wander into it, or if you get to close to them, they will kill you.<br/>
<br/>
So be careful, and have fun.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi fellow mistrels and other friends,<br/>
&gt; ´┐¢<br/>
&gt; I guess I have never really figured out how to use the lullably song<br/>
&gt; correctly.´┐¢ I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it<br/>
&gt; might be best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might<br/>
&gt; encounter.´┐¢ I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use<br/>
&gt; it....ok things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.´┐¢ Also<br/>
&gt; it is an area effect right, so do I target a creature,´┐¢myself, what?<br/>
&gt; ´┐¢<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>
&gt; ´┐¢<br/>
