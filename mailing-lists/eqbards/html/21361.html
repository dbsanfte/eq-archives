<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360392941">Since I have given up ever getting mez again, I have moved on with<br/>
(Dark)Elfson Allegro.  My guild has fallen in love with City of Mist this<br/>
week (after past affairs with Dalinars and Kaesora).<br/>
<br/>
So last night we actually had no enchanter (not usually an issue for us as 3<br/>
of our 20ish 35+ players are enchanters).  So our group is 45 warrior<br/>
(puller), 42 Wiz, 42 Druid, 35 Druid, 36 Shaman, and our hero (43 Bard).<br/>
<br/>
We were able to handle 3 and even 4 pulls with little trouble.  Pretty<br/>
simple too, Warrior beats (and taunts) the biggest mob, while I sing<br/>
beserker and target the second biggest mob (takes a little time to figure<br/>
out which one I should charm), I hit charm and back up a few steps.  When I<br/>
have my pooky charmed, I hit Binding, which agros at least one of the extra<br/>
mobs on me.  This causes my pooky to hit him, and I back up a bit more.<br/>
They fight each other, while I restart beserker.  (repeat cycle as needed,<br/>
though it easier to target my pet now).<br/>
<br/>
This leaves us with either the warrior eating 2 mobs or he and I each eating<br/>
one.  Either case is fine...<br/>
<br/>
While this is going, wiz and higher druid are blasting the day lights out of<br/>
mob1, and it quickly falls. Leaving us with an easily handled 3 mob pull.<br/>
By the time mob two has been dropped by the warrior/wizard/me (druid then<br/>
lays off and saves mana for heals), mobs 3 and 4 have beaten each other down<br/>
to like 2/3 of their original life.<br/>
<br/>
Whack whack whack...<br/>
<br/>
4 mobs dead.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing innovative or paticularly difficult going on here.  I<br/>
learned most of these techniques on this mailing list.  Was it ideal?  No,<br/>
but when is life in Norrath ideal?  (Ok maybe when you hear the<br/>
&quot;Cleric/Warrior/Enchnater/Rogue/Druid group looking for a bard to explore<br/>
the depths of Dungeon_MegaLoot&quot; shout and are the only bard in the zone).<br/>
<br/>
My point is life in Norrath goes on without lullaby.  And without an<br/>
enchanter in your group.  Most every group would like to have one, and you<br/>
lose some of the every important xp/time ratio without one.  But the same<br/>
can be said for warrior and cleric also.  Maybe this is a bigger drop off<br/>
from enchanter to bard then from warrior to pally/sk or cleric to<br/>
druid/shaman.  But to be honest, I love grouping without enchanters.  My<br/>
life is pretty boring when the enchanter is there (I become a mana pump).<br/>
With no enchanter I get to do so much more.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am sorry to see some of the old guard leaving, you guys have<br/>
taught me so much.  But you have to do what makes you happy.</div>
