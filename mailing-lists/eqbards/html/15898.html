<b>Subject:</b> Diamondine Earrings <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-856203155">Although I get harrassed by other bards in my guild for not having<br/>
Diamondines, I just don&#39;t feel that the stats are that great *for a bard*<br/>
(AC 2, STR 3, HP 12).  Definitely great earrings for a proper tank though.<br/>
I currently have Opallines from Unrest that are AC 2, CHA 5 and a jeweler<br/>
made STR/INT pair that I swap out when I want to feel butch.  But come on...<br/>
STR just isn&#39;t that important for a bard, and even with two Diamondines you<br/>
only add 24 HPs.  24 HPs is almost insignificant fighting most of the stuff<br/>
I fight (i.e. a Spite Golem that doubles on me for 130).  So to me it&#39;s down<br/>
to just the 4 AC points, the same as I get from my Opallines, along with 10<br/>
CHA points which are (should be :) significant to a lot of our songs.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome arguments in favor of Diamondines.<br/>

&gt; the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>
