&gt; I have inside sources that say she may have been taken off the server for<br/>
&gt; a little moment to fix a bug with the vendor.  This was evident because I<br/>
&gt; heard that people who can track her often see her name as !Genni which<br/>
&gt; signifies a broken NPC.<br/>

<br/>
-----<br/>
You say, &#39;what is sapphire?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
* Genni says &#39;My Brother Gardern holds the secret to making Sapphire Lambent Stones. Though he will<br/>
not speak of it, if you give him two sapphires and a Lambent Stone he will make you Sapphire Lambent.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s her brother who makes the lambent sapphires, which is what I need.  Do you think that Gardern<br/>
would still cough up lambent sapphires if Genni wasn&#39;t around?<br/>
