<div id="ygrps-yiv-434575506">Really?  The other night in at nox area in Sol B we had a bad pull coupled<br/>
with a respawn and ended up with 5 sonic bats.  I shouted for the cleric and<br/>
druid to keep me healed and went with Niv&#39;s + Hymn + CoC.  It was as long<br/>
fight but we won.  Every single person in the group was amazed that we did<br/>
not have to zone and lost no members.  Never underestimate your power as a<br/>
Bard ;)<br/>

You&#39;ll run out of hp&#39;s before any of them run out of mana.<br/>

I agree Sylly, I have no problem with our power level.  To me the key to the<br/>
our class is the diverisity in our abilities.  You also left out another<br/>
comparison:<br/>
<br/>
bard vs nec in DoT<br/>
bard vs shm in DoT<br/>
bard vs drd in DoT<br/>
<br/>
One night in Sol B I had a team member (a druid) ask me how long I could<br/>
keep doting for 120+ a tick and I told her, &quot;As long as I have HP&#39;s&quot; :)<br/>

Hehe,<br/>
<br/>
if you are going to compare bard vs ench to sha vs ench, compare all the<br/>
others too:<br/>
<br/>
bard vs wiz in nuke<br/>
clr vs wiz in nuke<br/>
ranger vs wiz in nuke<br/>
war vs wiz in nuke<br/>
<br/>
If you think that bards should be 67% as effective, should not everyone also<br/>
be 67% effective?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jack of all - master of none&quot; does not equate to &quot;almost as good&quot; or<br/>
acceptable substitute or second best at or &quot;67% as good as.&quot;  Bards can do a<br/>
variety of things.  Some better than others. Some lots worse.  There are<br/>
examples of that in all classes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It makes me nauseated because a level 14 cleric can cast invis to undead<br/>
and bards can&#39;t&quot; (well we can hope for level 39 song can&#39;t we?).  That&#39;s<br/>
just me showing class envy.   For whatever reason (design by Verant,<br/>
oversight by Verant), we cant do it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Verant gave us a taste of speed buff with our songs and that makes<br/>
us lust for more.  At some point, we just need to accept what we are and go<br/>
out and kill stuff.  It is good to know what is an effective technique but I<br/>
have liitle hope that Verant is gonna make dramatic improvements for us.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I find it nauseating is because a group with a L49<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bard can improve their performance by getting a L16 enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to buff them.<br/>
