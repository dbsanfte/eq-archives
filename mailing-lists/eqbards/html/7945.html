<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233787346">Oh so true!  What the heck is up with that anyhow?  Maybe I&#39;m awfully<br/>
old-fashioned for my age, but gads why do some men, no scratch that, boys in<br/>
this game think its socially acceptable under any circumstances to send<br/>
every female in the game a /tell commenting on their cleavage and can they<br/>
show more?  I&#39;ve seen a couple reasonable rp&#39;ing events of this sort that<br/>
were pretty funny, like the female bard in Freeport offering &quot;entertainment&quot;<br/>
for pay, singing optional.  On the whole though there is a frightening<br/>
dichotomy between the gentlemanly, &quot;Yes, I&#39;d love to help you, btw do you<br/>
need a rubicite helm?&quot; to the ridicuous pre-teen comments I have seen on my<br/>
friends screen.  She gets some of the most insulting and lewd /tells I have<br/>
ever seen.  Her /ignore list now numbers at somewhere over 100 people as a<br/>
result.  Of course her /friends list is also about 3 times as long as mine.<br/>
Just goes to show I guess, eerything has a price.  Must be Veran&#39;t idea of<br/>
balancing the sex not to make such things a bannable offense.<br/>

	LOL.  I personally would wear them, you earned them :-)  And yes,<br/>
women do get very preferential treatment I think.  I have stayed out of the<br/>
whole binding argument because I have never had a problem getting bound.<br/>
Ever.  Because my character is female, all I&#39;ve ever had to do is walk up to<br/>
a group and ask &quot;will one of you please bind me.&quot;  My warrior friend can<br/>
shout for HOURS and have no response.  I&#39;ve also been given numerous items<br/>
because I&#39;m &quot;cute.&quot;  Is this fair?  No. But then again, men don&#39;t have to<br/>
put up with tells from strangers who want to know if they like to be spanked<br/>
:P<br/>

	I will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is<br/>
my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now,<br/>
so many of these comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping,<br/>
farming ??). I have read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the<br/>
concept.<br/>
<br/>
	Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very<br/>
high level player, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked<br/>
me to keep singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with<br/>
him for several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about<br/>
this he said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him<br/>
I needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for<br/>
me and initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and<br/>
he said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate<br/>
and a pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I<br/>
could see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too<br/>
good for my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if<br/>
I should wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>
twinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an<br/>
opinion on what I should!<br/>
<br/>
	 do. <br/>
<br/>
	Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ? <br/>
<br/>
	Regards <br/>
