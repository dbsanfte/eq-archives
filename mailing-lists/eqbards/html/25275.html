Where can I find the info on how to spawn the &quot;bard trakanon&quot;?  Might be<br/>
time for me to finish this off too.<br/>

<br/>
Well, last night, after months of not even trying to work on it, I finished<br/>
my<br/>
Singing Short Sword quest. :)  A guild-mate won a scale on  a Vox raid a<br/>
couple<br/>
weeks ago, and that was the turning point for me.  We had I think 9<br/>
consecutive<br/>
Vox kills with only 1 white scale dropped.  It&#39;s been rough on MM ;p.<br/>
<br/>
My guild, Deadly Virtues, took the spawned Trakanon down with no problems;<br/>
our<br/>
first Trak kill (like may other servers, it&#39;s difficult to find him up to<br/>
kill!).  We had deaths, but learned a lot so that next time will be much<br/>
easier.<br/>
 <br/>
I am thrilled with the sword!  I think that the effort for our epic is<br/>
proportional to its quality.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share this with you all, with a hearty &#39;Thank you&#39; because so<br/>
much<br/>
work has been done by the community, of which we are all a part.<br/>
