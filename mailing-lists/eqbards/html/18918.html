<b>Subject:</b> Interesting tidbit from GZ on bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076198919">Although this was an enchanter post on EQCasters, the answer shows GZ may<br/>
actually be playing a bard even if he hasn&#39;t figured out some songs are<br/>
broken.<br/>
<br/>
Baelish: Since Enchanters are beat on more than any other class in the game.<br/>
Could the stats on insidious armor be looked at give higher ac / hitpoints?<br/>
Perhaps a self only AC spell be introduced at higher levels to help out?<br/>
Unlike other casters, Enchanters are forced to engage mobs that are<br/>
currently not attacking them in order to be effective in performing their<br/>
duties. With the use of charm and mesmerise at high levels this is even more<br/>
dangerous, yet Enchanters get no new tools to really help in this. Even<br/>
700HP on Rune V won&#39;t last more than a couple of rounds, and at a cost of<br/>
14p a cast.<br/>
 <br/>
GZ: Actually, Bards are beat on more then any other class in the game. And<br/>
no - Enchanters, need a party to help keep monsters off them - it is a<br/>
downside to being one of the most powerful classes in EQ. <br/>
