<b>Subject:</b> Re: Rubicite Armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602965661">Well rubicite is very good, but very hard to get. First, you&#39;ll have to<br/>
be in yours mid-20s. Then you&#39;ll have to travel to cazic-thule, near the<br/>
ogre home city. Once you eneter cazic you&#39;ll need to find a group and<br/>
hunt down the creatures that spawn with the armor, which is easier said<br/>
than do. The tae ew templar in the throne room has the leg greaves, a<br/>
golem(forget which one) has the hands, the avatar(which also holds the<br/>
demon claw) has the breastplate, and I forget who has the helm and the<br/>
arms. Of course, expect much camping of the mobs that have rubicite, as<br/>
the rubicite is very valuable and they usually carry something else that<br/>
is very valuable(like the demon claws for instance). On the other hand,<br/>
most high level(above 30 or so) people have rubicite now probably,<br/>
because, as I hunt in cazic, I tend to see 90% of the people in cazic<br/>
above 27 or so using it.<br/>

&gt; I would like information on Rubicite Armor, where does each piece come<br/>
&gt; from and how difficult are they to get?  I have seen many things on<br/>
&gt; rubi armor but not the actual monsters that carries each one.<br/>
