<div id="ygrps-yiv-357367725">Something I&#39;ll do is keep some throwing daggers on me. You can chuck one at your<br/>
target from just outside his bubble, that gives you a bit extra time to swap<br/>
weapons. The cost of daggers really isn&#39;t that high compared to the loot you can<br/>
get.<br/>

&gt; This is how I handle it:  First, in one section of my quickkey slots I have<br/>
&gt; my 2 weapon slots in hotkeys 1 & 2, and for the rest I have the slots in my<br/>
&gt; inventory.  Then I wield my mandolin and lament 3 beasts.  Rather than<br/>
&gt; bellowing (bellowing takes too long, first lament will wear off), I run up<br/>
&gt; to the fourth and wack him with my fists, turn and run.  While the creature<br/>
&gt; gives chase I can easily pick up my shield and place it on the mandolin in<br/>
&gt; my quickey slot, then put the madolin on my weapon and take it over to wield<br/>
&gt; it.  By this time I can then turn around and begin fighting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Realize that you should press F1 to target yourself, and go ahead and try<br/>
&gt; out a lament on yourself.  Now you can see just how long one of your own<br/>
&gt; laments will last.  Try it with just voice and a stringed instrument.  Voice<br/>
&gt; lament doesn&#39;t last long at all, but is probably best if you only need to<br/>
&gt; use on one creature.<br/>
