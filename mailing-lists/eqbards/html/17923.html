<div id="ygrps-yiv-3544591">Not really unprofitable...you just have to know who to sell it to.  I can make a full suit (assuming near zero failures) for ~37pp....I can then turn around and sell it for ~90pp (I have a very good Excel spreadsheet for anyone who&#39;s interested in cost per piece, per AC, per piece of material, etc...just email me and I&#39;ll send it to you).  It&#39;s not as profitable as other skills, but it&#39;s a living.  The ppl I have found who buy it--high levels twinking newbie friends or their lower level characters, and clerics (lots of them getting rid of bronze for banded).  There&#39;s also a thriving trade for small banded or large banded (harder to get the materials for).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Banded Armor is usually less than 1P per AC.  Bronze is normally 1+ a<br/>
&gt; bit per AC.<br/>
&gt; If you can carry it, skip banded and go right to bronze.  Its cheap<br/>
&gt; enough now, and no one makes banded anymore (since its so unprofitable) </span></blockquote></div>
