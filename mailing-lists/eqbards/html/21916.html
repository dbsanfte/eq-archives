&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gosh. Lets see... well, there&#39;s me and...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Me.  That&#39;s it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact of the 60 people in my guild (Praetoriate on Bertoxxulous), I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; only serious Bard.  We&#39;ve got a level 8 twink, and he only ever comes on<br/>
&gt; when his regular hunting partner isn&#39;t on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes I feel like the proverbial redheaded stepchild, but in time I<br/>
&gt; suppose that&#39;ll have its advantages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know Windleaf is on Bertoxx, too, but I&#39;ve yet to see him on the /who<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; bard 30 60 list... (are you anon?) Our server has tons and tons of newbie<br/>
&gt; Bards, but they all seem to drop off the face of Norrath when they hit 20<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; thereabouts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At peak times, I&#39;ll maybe see 16 post-30 non-anon/rpg Bards.<br/>
