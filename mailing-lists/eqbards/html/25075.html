<div id="ygrps-yiv-804343611">Grats!  Great to hear everything worked out so well!<br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re on the topic of hardware...<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to buy an Intel P4, you&#39;re most likely gonna be happy...if,<br/>
that is, you don&#39;t mind spending more.  Historically, Intel processors are<br/>
more expensive than AMD processors.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if you select Intel P4, you will be required to also purchase<br/>
a new type of memory (RAMBUS - if my memory serves...heh).  This memory is<br/>
much, much more expensive than the typical memory you see advertised today<br/>
(eg: $65 for 256MB RAM).<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, do your homework before you buy computers or computer<br/>
parts.  Pricewatch.com is an excellent source, and I have the Google toolbar<br/>
as part of my browser.  :)  Know what you&#39;re buying, and what your money is<br/>
being spent on.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t forget the &quot;arcane&quot; science of overclocking.  :)  With proper<br/>
cooling, you can get an 800Mhz processor to 1Ghz.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me directly for directions to the best (IMHO)<br/>
overclockers info/support site on the internet.  :)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] New Video Card and more Ram - the results for me...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, I created a topic should I add RAM and on what video card<br/>
to buy to help my EQ graphics.  I got a variety of replies, all much<br/>
appreciated.  Using that information, I surfed to find a good deal on a<br/>
Geforce2 Nvidia chip set video card.  Pricewatch.com helped with prices and<br/>
Google.com helped to search for hardware reviews.  From there, I decided on<br/>
a Geforce2 64MB Ultra - last revision of that chip series prior to the<br/>
Geforce3 that just came out.  Basic difference the Ultra gave on the earlier<br/>
Pro or GTS was faster memory and higher clock speeds which all equaled<br/>
higher frame rates.  I got it for $248 (price has come down with the release<br/>
of Geforce3 cards and will probably come down more, but I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
wait) and purchased it from 3D Graphics at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sg3d.com/">http://www.sg3d.com/</a> at the<br/>
recommendation of a friend who had purchased from them before.<br/>
<br/>
Just to remind this list, I have a PIII 450 mhz Pentium with 128 MB RAM.<br/>
The video card I had originally was a 16 MB Voodoo 3000.  <br/>
<br/>
First thing I did was install the additional 128 MB of memory bringing my<br/>
total up to 256 MB.  That cut the time from server select screen to<br/>
character select screen in half.  I don&#39;t know how much time the rest of you<br/>
take to get to character select, but my previous average time was around 2<br/>
minutes; it now takes about 50 seconds.  I also used to be the last one to<br/>
arrive when zoning or teleporting - no longer the case.  For the $40 dollars<br/>
at CompUSA I spent, I am happy with my new memory. <br/>
<br/>
Then I uninstalled my current Voodoo 3000(just follow the directions<br/>
included in your new card documentation) and installed the my new Ultra<br/>
card.  No hiccups during install - hardware is simple and drivers then<br/>
restart - no problem.  So I logon.  Looks nice.  Then I proceed to turn on<br/>
everything - all particle effects (I never knew our songs looked so neat or<br/>
spells in general were so cool), clipping plane maxxed, from 800 x 600 to<br/>
1024 x 768 (may even go higher - lol), cloud layers, mip mapping, etc.<br/>
Restarted to get mip mapping in effect.  Ran to Warsilks Woods, zoned in and<br/>
Woot!  I ran full tambourine Selos speed in and around all those damn trees<br/>
and my frame rate was solid and fast.  Can you tell I am happy?  Then I<br/>
remembered the EQclient had a setting to go from 16 to 32 bit mode.  So I<br/>
went out, changed that setting and started EQ back up - everything was still<br/>
great.  I am a happy bard!<br/>
<br/>
Now I know a better CPU/computer can help.  And I will go there someday.  If<br/>
I stay PIII, I will continue to have 256 MB, but the top speed of a PIII is<br/>
limited.  If I go P4 at that time, it&#39;s only $40 gone due to that memory (or<br/>
I can have a 2nd 256 MB computer to have a friend come over and play on or<br/>
bring up the info on that loot that just dropped).  The nice thing about the<br/>
video card is it will stay usable through that next CPU/computer.  I know<br/>
the Geforce3 is out, but this is a solid card that will give me gaming<br/>
pleasure for at least a few years.<br/>
<br/>
So to all of you that said to get a Geforce2 card, many many thanks.  As for<br/>
the memory, I got my bang for the buck, but your mileage may vary (some<br/>
folks on this list didn&#39;t have the same impact to login or zoning that I<br/>
got) as your system surely does.  BTW, the friends I normally play with all<br/>
use some variety of Geforce2 cards - GTS or Pro 32MB - and are also getting<br/>
good gaming results.  I just mention this as the cost of a GTS or Pro can<br/>
range from $100 to $200 which might fit your budget better and may now be<br/>
less - we all know how hardware prices drop as the next best thing is<br/>
released.  Good luck to you all.<br/>
<br/>
See you in Norrath,<br/>
