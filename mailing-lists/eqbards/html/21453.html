<div id="ygrps-yiv-282295054">The reason for the uproar is that the ENTIRE game up to this point has been<br/>
tested and balanced with the &#39;haste bug&#39; in place.  All those fast spawning<br/>
kunark dungeons we are supposed to due are now going to be much harder, as<br/>
either the groups will be killing things slower or spending more mana to<br/>
kill things at the same pace.  Either way total combat time (battle +<br/>
recovery) will be longer as more mana will be spent (more mana for haste or<br/>
more mana for healing/damage spells).  The PvE balance is about to get a<br/>
huge push, to the detrement of the players.<br/>

&gt; *snip haste stacking bug being fixed*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>
&gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>
&gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>
&gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>
&gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>
&gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>
&gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>
&gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  Could happen.<br/>
