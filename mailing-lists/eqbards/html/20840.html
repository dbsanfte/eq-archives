<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-677725684">When I first got pixie strike I used it to great<br/>
advantage along with my T Claw and silvery axe.  Even<br/>
in the Temple room of Dalnirs when that coerced caster<br/>
is running around casting, you can pixie strike it<br/>
still and beat the snot out of it, interupting most of<br/>
its spells.  The groups I was with loved me for this.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re in a full group and are facing multiple<br/>
casters, GR and ER/PR and drum with either COB or FCC<br/>
are a much better bet. <br/>
<br/>
And while the results are not as showy as lighting<br/>
that coerced edutite B*tch like a xmas tree, your<br/>
party will be in much better health after the fight.<br/>

Just my 2 notes<br/>

&gt; The kaesora coin I had to shell out 50P, but it was<br/>
&gt; the last one I needed,<br/>
&gt; and I wasn&#39;t about to let a measly 25p extra get in<br/>
&gt; my way (little did I<br/>
&gt; know that my guild had gotten me one in Kaesora the<br/>
&gt; night before after I<br/>
&gt; left).  Still whats 50P?  At lvl 35 I usually make<br/>
&gt; at least 200P a night<br/>
&gt; (keep in mind when I play I play for like 5 hours).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This brings me to a question for all of you out<br/>
&gt; there.  When fighting<br/>
&gt; casters I normally go to full pixie strike mode.  I<br/>
&gt; can usually get about<br/>
&gt; half the spells interupted (including almost all<br/>
&gt; heals as they are fairly<br/>
&gt; slow cast).  When fighting mellee mobs I normally<br/>
&gt; play Chant of Battle (drum<br/>
&gt; song), Binding (our enchanters LOVE me for this, as<br/>
&gt; it seems to taunt all<br/>
&gt; the mezzed mobs to me when they break) and something<br/>
&gt; else (hymm, damage<br/>
&gt; shield, rhythm, depends).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you think I would now be better served throwing<br/>
&gt; the drum in my hand and<br/>
&gt; singing rhythm, chant of battle and either guardian<br/>
&gt; rhythms or Curtaling<br/>
&gt; chant or hymm (with mandolin) against casters?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I may experiment this weekend, but I&#39;d like some<br/>
&gt; input first.<br/>
