<div id="ygrps-yiv-604048053">Interesting - I never heard about Vox doing that (but I only fought Vox<br/>
about three or four times before hitting 53).  I wonder if it&#39;s a &quot;Dragon&quot;<br/>
thing; I&#39;ve fought MANY summoning creatures; particularly fear kiting in<br/>
Skyfire - was doing Chants - possibly doing more damage than a Ranger - who<br/>
kept on getting Summoned...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the summoning rule is different in Velious than Kunark and<br/>
&gt; Old World<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would beg to differ, just because of one of my most spectactular<br/>
deaths--at Vox&#39;s lair, during my first Vox raid.  We had a buggy IG that<br/>
warped most of the way back to her lair, and then started summoning.  I<br/>
had not done melee damage or non-melee damage, or anything...all I was</div>
