<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488982315">Aye, thats funny on the Jagged Bands. I camped the Ghost all weekend last<br/>
week and we killed him every 20 minutes or so for about 15 hrs, with some<br/>
Hag spawns in his place every once in a while. We must have had 30 bands<br/>
though and were giving them away to everybody. I didnt really understand<br/>
there amazement having never really camped Unrest before. Then I heard<br/>
someone the next day auctioning one for 200pp, ROFL, and it sold for more. I<br/>
only kept one ring myself because I was 1st in line for the boots and we<br/>
never got them Saturday. Sunday morning though I was working the hallway to<br/>
the Ghost and some Druid cut in front of us clearing the way to the ghostand<br/>
pulled the whole room and the pit and ran. I Chained the Ghost out of the<br/>
train and killed him, and got both the boots and a ring, woohoo!<br/>

i myself prefer the bloodstained mantle for the magic resist... though the<br/>
ac is abit lower. As for the Jagged band, you really didnt pay much for it<br/>
there.  I&#39;ve bought 2 for 225 and sold em for 250pp each jagged band on<br/>

Just thought i&#39;d give ya a heads up on the ring<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] Crested Spaulders<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday, as I was about to Log off for the night A level 2 Enchanter was<br/>
&gt; offering 30pp for a Sow at the Qeynos Gates.  I gave him a tell and was<br/>
&gt; offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked there by<br/>
&gt; his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we ran down to<br/>
&gt; Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat back across<br/>
&gt; the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and I was 100pp<br/>
&gt; richer.<br/>
&gt; Today, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his<br/>
&gt; level 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I<br/>
&gt; arrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of Bronze<br/>
&gt; Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked him and<br/>
&gt; he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in the bank<br/>
&gt; was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and purchased my new<br/>
&gt; peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old Amber ring, the 2<br/>
&gt; bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old Rusty Spiked shoulders<br/>
&gt; to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I met the Cleric again and<br/>
&gt; he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter at the Caster Guild because<br/>
&gt; everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him there and once again thanked<br/>
&gt; him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am wondering   if The Crested<br/>
&gt; Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, or maybe I can trade it for<br/>
&gt; things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, a Second Jagged band,<br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am happy with my current<br/>
&gt; Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon dirk, so I think that<br/>
&gt; Armor is the way to go.<br/>
&gt; Any help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>
