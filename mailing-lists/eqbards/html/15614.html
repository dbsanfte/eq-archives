&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, none of the companies have really addressed the<br/>
&gt; &gt;full implications of this.  You&#39;re not playing a game; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;running around in a virtual world.  To prevent it from<br/>
&gt; &gt;dissolving into the anarchy where every guttersnipe can get<br/>
&gt; &gt;away with whatever he wants to do, you need a social support<br/>
&gt; &gt;structure - laws, some form of government<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem is that game mechanics, which are a simple system,  can never<br/>
&gt; ever hope to address the highly complex organic system that is human<br/>
&gt; behavior. It just can&#39;t be done. Look at Faction Hits on RZ, it seems<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Laws and social systems can&#39;t be coded in to a game with more than one<br/>
&gt; person playing it, all you can do is code to minimize the effects of those<br/>
&gt; who see freedom as lack of consequences for selfishness, after that it is up<br/>
&gt; to the players to *make* something out of the tools of their world, and make<br/>
&gt; the benefits of what they have created so desirable that people want to<br/>
&gt; support it.<br/>

human-operated laws and enforcement in these things.  Step 1<br/>
would be empowering the GMs to actually do things based on the<br/>
info they have available in these grey areas, instead of<br/>
parroting &quot;I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;<br/>
