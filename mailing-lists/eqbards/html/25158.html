<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044222929">If that was a &quot;problem&quot; there would be no selling or e-baying.  All accounts<br/>
sold this way require the account to have previously been established with<br/>
the original account owners credit card.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll split the chars off to a new account and then sell it.<br/>
<br/>
Long term - this isn&#39;t necessarily an e-bay issue - but short term it&#39;s a<br/>
huge one.  Every person with a reasonably (to very) high level character<br/>
they don&#39;t use any more will be tempted to split them off and sell them.<br/>

&quot;This should be rather interesting.  Power level a char up on a secondary<br/>
account, transfer to a friend that is too slow leveling or something...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cant transfer between accounts that are owned by different people (IE<br/>
different billing info including credit card.<br/>
<br/>

Wonder how big an impact this will be to the community.  Hmm have a friend<br/>
who quit and doesnt have the heart to start over, no problem, transfer him<br/>
one of your old characters...<br/>
