<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460002174">A level 30, yes, but they don&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
Griffons and Griffins are 34th through 36th, and would generally have any<br/>
melee based 40th level character for lunch in a solo stand up fight.<br/>
<br/>
With 3000 and up hitpoints, 98 point attacks, bashes, etc, it&#39;s well nigh<br/>
impossible to go toe to toe with one, alone, at that level.<br/>
<br/>
Any two melee types 35th and above can do it, though, and some of the finger<br/>
wagglers can dump enough mana on one to fry it, providing they get a chance<br/>
to cast.<br/>

&gt; Is it possible for a level 40 bard to take<br/>
&gt; out a level 30 griffin without using kite?<br/>
