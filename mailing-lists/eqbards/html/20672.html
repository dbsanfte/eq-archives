How many songs can you twist? 3-4 easily, if there is is a lot of AE going<br/>
on (because of the damn Blade of Fiery Lamentations) I still have to switch<br/>
to overhead view to lose the lag. The BoFL will at times cause slightly less<br/>
than 1 second screen freezes.<br/>
<br/>
Do you slow down when it rains? no, sometimes I get a little sad, but I have<br/>
some nice Earl Grey Tea and read some Rainer Maria Rilke and after a while<br/>
everything seems like it is going to be okay...<br/>
<br/>
How about in Unrest or Kunark? Unrest is now wonderfully huntable<br/>
