<div id="ygrps-yiv-61658362">I&#39;m only a lowly 22d level bard and have spent most of the past few levels<br/>
in Unrest.  I don&#39;t think I have ever fought any mob that was buffed with<br/>
SOW/SOC.  How many types of mobs are we talking about here?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
that the only mobs who can cast SOW/SOC are shamans.  How much of an impact<br/>
is this?  If camping these shaman-type mobs that can cast SOW/SOC are like<br/>
most of the places I&#39;ve been, as soon as they spawn the campers are all over<br/>
them.  Do they even have time to cast the SOW buff before they are attacked?<br/>
As I said earlier I&#39;ve never fought a mob that was buffed with SOW, but I<br/>
see this as a problem only if they have time to cast their buffs before they<br/>
are attacked.  <br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll find out on my own soon when I make 23d level.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; You can now no longer use Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains on rooted, ensnared or<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d mobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped. Especially in dungeons where the NPCs can cast SoW indoors,<br/>
&gt; &gt; although PCs cannot. The mob will flee from you and bring back a nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; train.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is very distressing.  I&#39;ve written at length about the<br/>
&gt; problems and ill-feelings that develop when you make monsters<br/>
&gt; work by different rules than players.  Instead of reducing<br/>
&gt; these differences, Verant seems to be increasing them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless of course this means that players with SoW or<br/>
&gt; Accelerando cannot be rooted by mobs?  That still seems<br/>
&gt; terribly unfair to the classes who cannot SoW or Accelerando<br/>
&gt; themselves.<br/>
