&gt; I would sure hate to see you go.  I think you are a really great Bard.  And<br/>
&gt; to see you quit just cause you see some twink that has an attitude - would<br/>
&gt; sadden me greatly.  So, hang in there and have some great adventures!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or start a new bard on Innoruuk and Harm and I will twink you to the max!!!<br/>

thought THAT was ridiculous!)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt; and I just hit level 36.  ...  I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing <br/>
&gt; a game that makes me feel this way.<br/>
