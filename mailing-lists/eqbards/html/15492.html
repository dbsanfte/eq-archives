<div id="ygrps-yiv-91707863">There are also giant skeletons to the left just after you come in from<br/>
Feerott. You go through this V between two mountains, follow the right wall<br/>
until you get to a lizard camp. GO across the green area to the hill and<br/>
follow that<br/>
hill to the LEFT until you get back to the GS camp.<br/>

&gt;Greetings everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hunted Giant Skeletons over the weekend near the entrance to Lake Rathe.<br/>
&gt;I was in a low 20&#39;s group of 4 and the xp was great.  Is there another area<br/>
&gt;besides the one at the entrance to LR that has the GSs?  We were having to<br/>
&gt;split the spawn with another group and could have handled a faster spawn<br/>
&gt;rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
