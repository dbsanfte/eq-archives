&gt; One note, if we examine the group I am in, there is one warrior, a cleric<br/>

&gt; tried having me play instruments but I still do too much melee damage to<br/>
&gt; simply play. So the cleric/warrior keep me alive (they are husband and wife<br/>
&gt; and in the same room so they work GREAT together) and I melee. I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; this changing for a long time, unless we get another tank (which I would<br/>
&gt; LOVE). But good players are hard to come by, so we will see.<br/>

effective using just instruments (casters don&#39;t count because<br/>
they kill mobs so quickly my songs aren&#39;t in effect long<br/>
enough for the difference between singing and instruments to<br/>
become apparent).  If there&#39;s just one other tank, I still use<br/>
my weapons.  If there&#39;s two, I will use weapons or instruments<br/>
depending on the situation and the other party members.  <br/>
Three or more tanks and it&#39;s instruments all the way.<br/>
