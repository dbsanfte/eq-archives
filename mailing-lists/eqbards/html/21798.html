&gt;for some reason or another attempts to shoot down many of the issues<br/>
&gt;Kaearia, Rokenn and other well known bards have been fighting for.  She<br/>
&gt;apparently has no problems with how Verant is handling the many issues<br/>
&gt;facing bards.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, that&#39;s not me.  of course kaearia posted on the concert hall that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a lot of problems with the way verant is handling the issues either, at least<br/>
with regard to gordon&#39;s monster post.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One other point to make.  Just because Kitasi (31st level) and I (39th<br/>
&gt;level) are not high level bards doesn&#39;t mean we are not aware of all the<br/>
&gt;problems higher level bards have to put up with.  Both Kitasi and I have<br/>
&gt;been members of this mailing list since it was created.  Because I read this<br/>
&gt;list as well as the Concert Hall board, I probably know more about the 50+<br/>
&gt;bard songs than some of the 50+ bards on my server.  If you are content with<br/>
&gt;primarily functioning as a mana battery, then you don&#39;t have anything to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>say what?  where have i ever said EVER that i am functioning as a mana battery???<br/>
everyone else is saying that this is all bards are good for.  i have CONSTANTLY<br/>
been saying that i do NOT see this with my bard and that i have just as many<br/>
options in playing my bard as i had before.  I notice that you two never address<br/>
the logical points in my post re: options available to bards at any level.  you simply<br/>
continue the same old line of lullaby is broken, mez is broken, snare is broken<br/>
oh 90% of my options are gone.  i say that if that kills 90% of your options<br/>
then you aren&#39;t playing your bard to the fullest capabilities.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;worry about.  No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>
&gt;these issues.  For the other 99% of the bards out there who want full,<br/>
&gt;working functionality out of the class, then there are still issues to<br/>
&gt;discuss.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your definition of full working functionality seems to differ with the game creator&#39;s<br/>
definition of full working functionality.<br/>
