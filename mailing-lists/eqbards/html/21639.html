What i&#39;ve seen in planes when grouping with the bards was pretty much nivs,<br/>
haste, mana, heal and i think poison resist or disease resist. Sorry been so<br/>
long since i went up. Im sure one of the big boys on the list would be much<br/>
more qualified to answer that question<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d suggest you nag your 3 people that go regularly, strong chance that they<br/>
might not have a bard on their regular trips or their bard is pretty decked<br/>
out, meaning you can have leftovers stuff.  A tip, dont sing when they&#39;re<br/>
pulling or you&#39;ll be seeing the ol &quot;someone wishes to ressurect you, do you<br/>
wish this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My bard isnt planes ready yet, but damn i cant wait. <br/>

<br/>
Woohoo!  I broke out of 45 last night (man that level stunk).  I am well<br/>
into my death buffer (got 2 bubs in an empty SolB last night due to lag, we<br/>
held all three King, Priest and Champ rooms), so I am raring up for planes.<br/>
<br/>
A few questions:  How do you get invited to go on Planes?  I only know like<br/>
3 people who go to them regularly, and my guild is still at least a month<br/>
away from being capable of doing it on our own.<br/>
<br/>
Any sites have a goodplanes guide I could read?<br/>
<br/>
What songs seem to be the songs of choice there?<br/>
<br/>
