<div id="ygrps-yiv-931602889">I don&#39;t know about Xegony, but on Tunare generally the dragons die within 12 hours of the servers coming up.  That, and we use a reservation type system (based on EzBoard) where leaders will sign up for entire weeks such that they can lead given a patch day or a regular respawn and anyone interested in joining the raid can contact them well ahead of time.  Oh, the dragons are booked months ahead of time on Tunare, too, just as something to possibly look forward to dependent on your server.<br/>

<br/>
  Just starting the epic quest at 52nd and hoping to get into one or two<br/>
  more Naggy/Vox dragon raids on Xegony before I hit 53rd. So I wanted try<br/>
  this idea out on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
  On my second account would it make sense to create two first level rogues?<br/>
  One Barb to sneak and park in EF/Perm and one DE to sneak and park in<br/>
  Lava/Sol B?<br/>
<br/>
  While I&#39;m playing Tzeetch, I&#39;m thinking I could check for late night raids<br/>
  on the second account. (My usual playing time is 10pm ~ 2am PDT.) Sounds<br/>
  simple, but since I haven&#39;t heard of anyone discuss I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m<br/>
  missing something.<br/>
<br/>
  Btw, any fellow Xegony Bards know of any Friday raids going on for these<br/>
  two? I have the day off from family and work this Friday :-).<br/>
