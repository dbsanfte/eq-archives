&gt; I see from the board that many of you are upset that the <br/>
&gt; undead spawns in Kithicor were <br/>
&gt; stopped.  I&#39;d like to make the following points:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But this is a FRPG!  It would be similar to telling the Ringwraights that<br/>
they couldn&#39;t come into Hobbiton, because it&#39;s a &quot;newbie zone&quot;.  Don&#39;t get<br/>
me wrong : The points you listed are reasonable and valid, but why should we<br/>
feel perfectly safe each and everytime we cruise through Kithicor?  Waiting<br/>
for daybreak to make the journey is *cool* - of course it isn&#39;t time spent<br/>
powerlevelling, but it&#39;s time spent in a FRPG world.  If I was Verant, I&#39;d<br/>
be popping out little suprises like this ALL the time.<br/>
