<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467251496"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Heh.  I was just thinking it might be neat to have a +/-<br/>
&gt;rating for EQ characters, kinda like they have for hockey.<br/>
&gt;For those that don&#39;t follow the sport, your +/- rating in<br/>
&gt;hockey is the number of goals your team scored while you were<br/>
&gt;on the ice, minus the number of goals the other team scored<br/>
&gt;while you were on the ice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So you could inspect a player and see the number of<br/>
&gt;experience-giving monsters killed while grouped, divided by<br/>
&gt;number of group members who&#39;ve died while grouped.  i.e. avg<br/>
&gt;number of monsters killed per death incurred.  So if a cleric<br/>
&gt;had a tendency to let group members die, you could avoid him<br/>
&gt;without having to experience several deaths for yourself.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nutty idea, doesn&#39;t fit into roleplaying, but fun to think<br/>
&gt;about.  Though a number like this would focus attention away<br/>
&gt;from self-improvement (or self-preservation as the case may<br/>
&gt;be), and more towards group cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I think it fits into roleplaying as well as any stat does - how <br/>
conducive to roleplaying is it to know exactly how charismatic you are, or <br/>
how many hitpoints you have?  For that matter, how exactly can I tell the <br/>
level of difficulty (con)  of a monster I have never seen before, nor even <br/>
heard of?  None of this information should be available to me in-character.<br/>
<br/>
John, I think this efficiency rating is a wonderful idea, though it is also <br/>
sadly a pipe dream.  I end up in a lot of pickup groups, and would dearly <br/>
love to know what I am getting into before putting my life in their hands.  <br/>
I am getting to the point now where I give a brief description of the songs <br/>
I am going to play and what reaction to expect from the monsters (e.g. <br/>
&quot;they&#39;re all going to pound on me preferentially - please please watch my <br/>
health&quot;).  I think after last night&#39;s wretched repeat of my Unrest woes <br/>
(another 3 deaths, the last one a doozy and really funny in a grim sort of <br/>
way) I will start asking clerics when I first am considering joining a <br/>
party, &quot;If I am badly wounded, will you heal me?&quot;  If they can&#39;t or won&#39;t <br/>
answer in the affirmative, I will not join.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that clerics can be a bard&#39;s best friend.  I have some cleric <br/>
friends with whom I group whenever possible, and I never die when with one I <br/>
know and trust.  However, places like (argh!) Unrest seem to appeal to the <br/>
kind of cleric that secretly wishes he were a wizard - the kind that will <br/>
spend all his mana blasting the undead.  The cleric I was grouped with last <br/>
night refused to give anyone any buffs, and only healed himself as far as I <br/>
noticed.<br/>
<br/>
How would efficiency ratings help?  I&#39;d love to see a number that says <br/>
&quot;Group average experience gain&quot;, one for &quot;Average experience gain (personal) <br/>
while grouped&quot;, and one for &quot;Average experience gain solo&quot;.  Thus I could, <br/>
by looking at the numbers, determine that such-and-such a druid (e.g.) has <br/>
far more experience soloing than grouping, based on the comparitive numbers, <br/>
and could see that such-and-such a cleric (e.g.) had a good record of <br/>
keeping group members alive while gaining experience, or that he seems to <br/>
get a lot more experience than his group members, indicating that he&#39;s not <br/>
to be trusted with your life.<br/>
<br/>
You know, the more I think about it, the more I agree that this kind of data <br/>
would really aid in group dynamics... and would quite possibly function as <br/>
both a lifesaving selection criterion and a source of useful information on <br/>
self-rating (how well am I doing?  well, I gain about 9 bubbles per death <br/>
while solo, versus about 5 bubbles per death grouped, though when grouped my <br/>
group members tend to get around 7 bubbles per death - hmmm I am dying too <br/>
often in groups, must look for better people).  Considering the focus placed <br/>
on groups in EQ, this sort of data could transform pickup groups, and quite <br/>
possibly save bards like me from pointless and aggravating deaths.<br/>
