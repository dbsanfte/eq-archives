 </span></blockquote>Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power, and perhaps<br/>
overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd control.  Whenever<br/>
two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, command it to /pet<br/>
guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a ways away, and<br/>
reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
<br/>
However, I heard through the grapevine of a bard on another server who<br/>
charmed the Key Master in the airplane to attack Sirran the Lunatic.  The<br/>
lucky bard took such a faction hit that he is now scowling to all quest<br/>
NPCs in the zone.<br/>
