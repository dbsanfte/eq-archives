<div id="ygrps-yiv-185138518"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; i think Adam is right, there is always something better to do than <br/>
 </span></blockquote>DDD. lemme think a sec, yes always.  and if there is always something <br/>
better to do than DDD, then it is useless.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, what <br/>
changes would need to be made to make it worth memming in place of <br/>
some other song?<br/>
<br/>
Put it on a timer, rather than consuming mana?  10 minutes?<br/>
<br/>
Increase the damage?  What damage would be sufficient to make it <br/>
worth memming?<br/>
<br/>
Make it DD rather than AE? <br/>
<br/>
What would be the point of ever memming our 55 BBB (except maybe for <br/>
the stun effect) if DDD was made single target?  Other than having 2 <br/>
songs to cycle through, but who has 2 free song slots?<br/>
