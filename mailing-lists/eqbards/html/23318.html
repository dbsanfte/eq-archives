&gt;killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.  Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky with<br/>
&gt;the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>
&gt;Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well i wouldn&#39;t use charm in sebilis without a shaman or cleric, i would use pixie<br/>
or twilight.  the shaman or cleric just opens up more opportunities for flexibility.<br/>
note that you&#39;ve already backed down from the original statement which was that<br/>
a cleric and enchanter are 100% required for any group post 50 (in a kunark dungeon),<br/>
and that statement was the only thing i had a problem with.  i don&#39;t know how well<br/>
pixie works, they fixed both songs after i had twilight and i always use twilight instead.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...  Regardless - maybe you feel that 80 per<br/>
&gt;cent of the people in the game are mediocre.  Maybe they are - but to me the<br/>
&gt;game is about having an enjoyable entertainment experience; not about<br/>
&gt;competing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that may be true for you, but the &#39;&#39;hard&#39;&#39; parts of the game need to be tuned to the<br/>
good players, not the average players.  otherwise where are the good players going<br/>
to go for challenge and fun?  (this is all in the context of a single group, not raids like<br/>
trakanon or vs or other dragons)<br/>
