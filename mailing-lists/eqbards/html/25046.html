<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675045243">I do mostly what Kenross does, especially when travelling. I have 3 chants<br/>
memmed and selos in the first 4 slots.  The trick with sticking all 3 for<br/>
me, is stick the first two, be within range of the mob, cast the 3rd chant<br/>
and haul arse while selos icon is still up... on a good lag day, i can see<br/>
the song hasn&#39;t been resisted, the selos icon will fall, and I&#39;ll be<br/>
stopping my 3rd chant and begin selos. selo&#39;s will be up in time for me for<br/>
my feet to move faster just as the mob is catching up. Now this is way<br/>
harder if the mob has natural SoW or faster. Snow griffins, shadowmen, and<br/>
other speedy mobs i don&#39;t recommend trying the 3rd chant. If you have<br/>
jboots, you can kite slow mobs around all day<br/>
One bard on my server was telling me how easy that was. I thought it was an<br/>
insult to our class to even wear/use jboots, much less occupy the AC camp<br/>
for that period of time, when someone who clearly needs them more than you<br/>
could be in it.<br/>
Hehe and I tire of getting in groups where I have to travel, I&#39;m forever<br/>
telling them to click off lev/sow/jboots, so they can keep up (with selos),<br/>
or go invis (with song of travel). Where have these people been ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic... that&#39;s for travel. this is for battle without<br/>
shaman/chanter....<br/>
<br/>
#1 Elemental - for any unexpected caster encounters<br/>
#2 Chorus of Celerity (45%haste iirc)<br/>
#3 Chant of Battle - Stacks with everything I love it :)<br/>
#4 Largo&#39;s Binding - 40%?? target slow/snare<br/>
#5 Cantana of Replenishment - mana/stam/hp regen - I&#39;ll toss in a pulse or<br/>
two for the ailing tanks when they&#39;re fatigued<br/>
#6 Niv&#39;s Melody of Pres. - A great song to stack with #5 for hp regen when<br/>
healer is medding hard. (equip lute of course)<br/>
<br/>
#7-10 are various hotkeys, a bag slot with all my weapons, /assist hotkey,<br/>
and my 1st and 2nd melee slot<br/>
<br/>
With chanter/shaman<br/>
I&#39;ll substitute #2 haste for L50 VoV. It&#39;s a nice str/ac/atk buff.<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll take  snare out of the rotation if there&#39;s a competent<br/>
ranger/druid, but I *still* keep memmed. (accidents happen)      and I&#39;ll<br/>
put in dmg shield or something completely random hehe. (for laughs I like to<br/>
put in melifluous motion LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Never a dull moment.<br/>
<br/>
Ranger tells the group, &quot;wtf?&quot;<br/>
Bard tells the group, &quot;LOL!!&quot;<br/>
Chanter tells the group, &quot;/sigh&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pava<br/>
CT<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Just last night i had to use that song to get someone unstuck while he<br/>
was in a trade window with someone after Trakanon. He said his computer was<br/>
acting strange. I said hold on boys!! *swishing sound* He was like cool! The<br/>
bards and their songs...</div>
