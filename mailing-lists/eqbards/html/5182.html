<div id="ygrps-yiv-905847523">Could the missed notes only happens on certain server(s)?  I am a lv 44 bard <br/>
on Cazic-Thule server, and I haven&#39;t notice any extra missed notes since <br/>
this thing started.  Not enough to notice it anyway.  Or maybe it only <br/>
affects wood elf or human bard?  I am a half elf.  Or maybe it is level <br/>
related?  Seems like a lot of the people who have the missed notes are in <br/>
their high 20s to high 30s.<br/>

&gt;Let&#39;s consider the possibility that it (the missed note bug) may not happen<br/>
&gt;_for_everyone_ - _all_of_the_time_.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s very possible that there is a bug but it does not affect everyone the<br/>
&gt;same way.<br/>
