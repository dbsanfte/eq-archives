&gt; OK, cool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really appreciate all of your comments about my unfortunate human banded<br/>
&gt; helm situation.  I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban from<br/>
&gt; the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with almost<br/>
&gt; no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I can<br/>
&gt; start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hatar is a spawn so rare, I, and most people I know, have never seen<br/>
him. He spawns in either Oasis or S Ro (so I&#39;ve heard) and I used to<br/>
check tracking every time I passed through there. I even auctioned that<br/>
I would pay 100 plat for a tell from someone when he was sighted and<br/>
never once got a message. I lucked out and got one from someone who did<br/>
stumble across him, and I traded a serpantine bracer for it. I&#39;ve only<br/>
run across 3 of them on Tarrew Marr, counting the one I have.<br/>
