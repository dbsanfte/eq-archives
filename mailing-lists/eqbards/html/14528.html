<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467650901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.    Last week I was in SK beating up treants(I know, I know bad juju<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with druids, but I have faction to burn) when the necro in the party went<br/>
LD, I was still singing DDD and suddenly his Pet is on me like white on<br/>
rice(glad it was the level 20 pet hehe) has anyone else had this happen to<br/>
them? I was able to kill it with 59 HP left.<br/>
<br/>
This happens to me all the time when my GF&#39;s mage goes LD.  When someone<br/>
goes LD, their character turns into an NPC.  The pet is then able to be<br/>
damaged and thus pissed off at you.  The only way I know to stop it is for<br/>
the player to log back in in time, or to kill the pet.  Or, to stop playing<br/>
ANY AE song as soon as you see the LD message.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.    I like many here only can play for about 2-4 hours a night 4 nights<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a week, so a regular group is out of the question, hell my guildmates second<br/>
chars are starting to pass me in levels. So my question is where is good to<br/>
hunt solo or in a pickup&lt;shudders&gt; group? I&#39;m burnt out with Lake Rathe and<br/>
SK been there since 17th when I left that hell on Norrath HighPass.<br/>
<br/>
The courtyard in Cazic might work, tho all trains from the other areas run<br/>
thru there.  It&#39;s also very laggy for me, for some reason.  Courtyard in<br/>
Mistmoore is similar, with more trains and less lag. :)  EK has some crag<br/>
spiders that might be soloable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.    My current weapon load is Bladed Claws in Primary, Silvery 1h axe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>secondary, and Dragoon Dirk in Ranged slot, I sometime switch in a BE Mace<br/>
in secondary to raise 1hb so I can use the Head Bopper Staff I have in the<br/>
bank when I make 29th. Is this a good weapon load or should I change<br/>
anything around ?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest to put the Dirk in one of your main weapon slots occasionally,<br/>
just to keep piercing maxed.  The stats on the Mace are better than the<br/>
Thulian claws (bad weapon other than the look, imo)... I would use the Mace<br/>
and Axe as main weapons.<br/>
