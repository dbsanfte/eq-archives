<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840315099">What &quot;items&quot; do you need to get in Runnyeye?<br/>
<br/>
A lone bard at 30 will have a tough time in Runneye.  The dungeon has agro<br/>
tied closely to levels and at 30 you will still get too much attention.  If<br/>
it&#39;s always empty, you will have a tough time breaking any of the popular<br/>
spawn spots because there will be 3-4 gobs that will agro when you attack<br/>
the first one.  The dungeon boss, Lord Borxx (sp?) - a named evil eye - will<br/>
own you if he finds you. Lev 40+ druids stop by from time to time to hand<br/>
him some paybacks.  Invis works for about 90% of the gobs but you will get<br/>
some that see thru it and they will agro you if you are merely exploring.<br/>
<br/>
I got killed there a few times from 8 to 20 just passing thru and avoided<br/>
ever exploring it.  I kept telling my self this is a place for foolish high<br/>
20 and brave lo to mid 30&#39;s.  Then one day I noticed I was 38 and doh!  Time<br/>
to check out Runnyeye.  Thru my 40&#39;s I would cruise through and grab various<br/>
things but I missed the dungeon when I was the level it would give exp to.<br/>
Except one time, I got in a group that knew what to do: invis and go to the<br/>
warlord room.  Camp there and keep the door shut.  Spread the spawn and fite<br/>
once every 18 minutes or so.  The place looks like it would be good for 2 or<br/>
3 mid 20 to lo 30 groups to work if they worked together.  But at that age,<br/>
we were still learning how to be a good single group - let alone coordinate<br/>
with 2 others.<br/>
<br/>
One time I was passing thru and helped by dragging a couple corpses out.<br/>
Then some one trained the banker to the zone and was getting beaten. So, I<br/>
attacked the banker to taunt him off and while we were fighting, I did a<br/>
mouse over and the bank windows opened up - heh.  So, I changed my small<br/>
coins while he hit me for 2 and 3 and then killed him - was funny.<br/>
<br/>
Runnyeye is one of the best dungeons in terms of the detail and art.  Very<br/>
interesting things in there - your imagination can go wild.  It also has<br/>
some really fun tunnels and mazes.  It&#39;s really pretty sad that it is so<br/>
under utilized.  I need to come back with a party of mid-20 char&#39;s and see<br/>
how it works.  I&#39;d like to see how a party fares with a bard playing<br/>
ele&guardians or purifiyn&guardians - then camp the evil eye room behind the<br/>
baracade:  evil eye, & 2 dazed goblin guards for a total of 3 casters.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; How would a lone bard fare soloing in Runnyeye at level 30?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know its a weird question but I need to get some items and every time I<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; into Runnyeye its empty and all my guildmates are in Kunark.<br/>
