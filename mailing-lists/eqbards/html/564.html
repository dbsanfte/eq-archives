<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008671042">I pointed out to the GM that Meldrath was casting Charm through walls without<br/>
ever having clear line of sight to me and told him I thought it was a bug.  The<br/>
GM told me that it is NOT a bug and that there is nothing that can be done for a<br/>
player in this circumstance.  Anyway, I have not found the GM&#39;s to be too helpful<br/>
and while it sucked for me at the time, I am more glad that they are not passing<br/>
out favors and goodies to every person that can think up a good story.  Too many<br/>
people would abuse it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; FYI, any monster casting a spell or charming through a wall is considered a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bug!  So if you are charmed in this manner, you may petition to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself resurrected.  Do not rule out this option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *SNICKER*<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s funny!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, seriously though, I guess it is TECHNICALLY an option.  But be<br/>
&gt; warned - after losing my corpse due to a game bug, I petitioned, and<br/>
&gt; a week and a day later I finally was contacted by a GM.  Actually,<br/>
&gt; that is not true - a friend of mine contacted a GM, as he is on for<br/>
&gt; at least double the amount of time that I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if you are not contacted by the GM before your corpse decays,<br/>
&gt; then it is GONE!  No they can not, or maybe will not reimburse you<br/>
&gt; for items you were carrying.  Mino axe?  gone.  Magic armour? gone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, you may be lucky and play during &#39;peak&#39; times, when the<br/>
&gt; concentration of GMs is likely to be higher.  And I guess that the<br/>
&gt; number of GMs has increased since my sad and sorry experience.<br/>
