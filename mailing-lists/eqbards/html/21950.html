&gt; &gt; You can believe I&#39;m going to start pouring over enchanter spells at EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; Casters right now. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Note that the enchanter spell list refers to a lot of things as stuns<br/>
&gt;that really aren&#39;t. It says mez &quot;stuns&quot; the target, as well as the whirl<br/>
&gt;till you hurl line of spells. This is different from the color<br/>
&gt;shift/slant/skew line which are really stuns. i.e. you can beat on the mob<br/>
&gt;for the duration of the spell without them hitting back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By 44 enchanters have 3 stuns that are aoe around themselves and can be<br/>
&gt;chain cast almost repeatedly for very little mana. Cast time 1-2 sec<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even at 20 however, they have a 4 and 6 sec stun with recast times of 12<br/>
&gt;seconds, so they can almost keep a mob nailed down permanently just with<br/>
&gt;them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea, I noticed that Casters Realm doesn&#39;t seem to use the word &quot;mez&quot; <br/>
accurately at times. My definition of a mez would be if you damage the <br/>
creature, the creature breaks the mez vs stun where the creature remains <br/>
stunned.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clarification!</div>
