to help you, or you can get up around 6am eastern to camp the<br/>
spot.  Highpass basically is a place for mages and wizards to<br/>
camp and kill things and sell the special weapons to the melee<br/>
types who could easily have killed the mobs themselves if the<br/>
mages and wizards weren&#39;t there.  Come to think of it, most<br/>
places are like this, but nothing exemplifies it more than<br/>
Highpass (well, maybe Crush&#39;s tower in Crushbone).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind this so much if there were named mobs who<br/>
carried nice mage-type items and were so resistant to magic<br/>
that you needed to melee to kill it.  Unfortunately, things<br/>
are very one-sided right now.<br/>
