&gt;(lol like many of us are gonna see 53 ;) and again at 56.  (Parry and<br/>
&gt;Riposte).  I personally doubt I will ever see 53 or 56... my time in EQ is<br/>
&gt;dwindling.  I dunno if I&#39;ll even reach 50 for Lyrnia (currently 45 and 2<br/>
&gt;bubbles).  And Lyrnali (my 51 bard on Test) has already been deleted in<br/>
&gt;disgust over the whole Test fiasco.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uhh jeez where&#39;d I go with this?  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting. I&#39;ve been hearing a lot more like this of late...<br/>
Meara (my enchanter) has been a bubble from 29 for over 4 weeks<br/>
now. I tried creating a new character and logging on -- i&#39;ve ALWAYS<br/>
in the past had fun with a new character. But... No Go. Its just not<br/>
as fun as RL is anymore. Or maybe Everquest has lost its charm. Or.<br/>
Something.<br/>
<br/>
But... I&#39;m hearing more and more people not having fun of late.<br/>
