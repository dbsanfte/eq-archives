<div id="ygrps-yiv-11899210">Just finished parsing my log file from a night killing<br/>
seafuries.  With a six-note, wakizashi, haste belt, and<br/>
augmentation (putting me at max haste), I averaged just about<br/>
11.0 damage/sec in melee.  Factoring out a haste belt and<br/>
factoring in Verses, that would&#39;ve been about 8.2 damage/sec<br/>
which agrees with the average Raiel got.<br/>
<br/>
How does this compare to instrument attacks?<br/>
<br/>
CoC+CoD with a lute at L50:<br/>
CoD = ~50 damage/6 sec<br/>
CoC =  32 damage/6 sec<br/>
total = 82 damage/6 sec = 13.7 damage/sec<br/>
total w/ gypsy lute = 85 damage/6 sec = 14.2 damage/sec<br/>
total w/ Kelin&#39;s lute = 98 damage/6 sec = 16.3 damage/sec<br/>
<br/>
Chants with a drum at L50:<br/>
<br/>
FCC = ~31 damage/6 sec<br/>
CoF = 48 damage/6 sec<br/>
total = 127 damage/6 sec = 21.2 damage/sec<br/>
total w/ MM drum = 148 damage/6 sec = 24.7 damage/sec<br/>
total w/ Selo&#39;s drum = 169 damage/6 sec = 28.2 damage/sec<br/>
<br/>
So the Chants offer superior damage, but the Chords can be<br/>
mixed in more easily with healing.  Since healing affects your<br/>
entire party, that can easily make Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD better<br/>
than the Chants.  Chords are also better against multiple<br/>
targets (obviously), since just one extra target doubles the<br/>
damage rate.<br/>
<br/>
If I used the Chords while fighting with weapons, that would<br/>
put me at 18 damage/sec.  But I lose out on half the healing<br/>
with the Hymn+Nivs+CoC+CoD combo as well.  OTOH, using the<br/>
Chants with weapons equipped puts me at about the same damage<br/>
rate as if I were using a normal drum (21.7 damage/sec).  <br/>
Since there&#39;s no healing factor here, if I&#39;m going to use the<br/>
3 Chants, it clearly makes more sense for me to use my Selo&#39;s<br/>
drum than my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m using only two chants (CoFl+CoFr), then with a Selos<br/>
drum my damage is 128 damage/6 sec = 21.3 damage/sec.  With<br/>
weapons it&#39;s 19 damage/sec.  So it still makes sense to use a<br/>
drum.<br/>
<br/>
FCC debuffs MR though, which is arguably more useful, so if I<br/>
use FCC+CoF, then with a Selo&#39;s drum my damage is 105 damage/<br/>
6 sec = 17.5 damage/sec.  With weapons and singing the Chants,<br/>
it&#39;s also 17.5 damage/sec.  So this will be a toss-up<br/>
depending on resist rates.<br/>
<br/>
So in a nutshell, there are very few situations where our<br/>
weapons will be superior to an instrument attack.<br/>
<br/>
On a whim, I tried FCC+CoFl+CoFr+CoC on one seafury, switching<br/>
instruments.  I managed to steal it from my friends who were<br/>
grouped (L38 bard, L35 cleric, L43 monk w/ FBSS, L44<br/>
enchanter).  My calculated damage was 221 damage/6 sec = 36.8<br/>
damage/sec for that configuration.  Obscene.  :)<br/>
