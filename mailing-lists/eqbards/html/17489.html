Faesong [Angelfire]@Solusek Ro has finally surpassed Faesong [Joat]@Test<br/>
<br/>
She made 17 last night, and can dual wield like a true bard (I<br/>
also learned that this is the level of Sneak.) She reached this<br/>
&quot;exalted&quot; level at 3d, 23 h, 1 min.<br/>
<br/>
What is even more surprising is that I learned she can dual wield<br/>
WITHOUT training. After I hit 17, I put two weapons in her two hands...<br/>
(Staff of Writhing and PGT in the off-hand) And it let me! On my way back<br/>
to Qeynos to buy my song, I saw a highland lion that conned blue.<br/>
I went and attacked it. I saw BOTH crushing and slashing attacks.<br/>
AND I got two increases in Dual Wield (which evidently starts at 35...<br/>
Very odd. It went up to 36 and 37 as I watched)<br/>
<br/>
Definitely a Stamina drain though. She was down just under 2bub of stamina<br/>
after killing the blue.<br/>
<br/>
What level does Obsidian Dagger start proc&#39;ing? That weighs less so may<br/>
make a better offhand weapon and trade off with slashing and crushing in<br/>
the main hand. (I want to keep all three skills maxed)<br/>
<br/>
Now that she&#39;s 17, I&#39;m going to park her down in the ARena area. Get<br/>
a bind in Arena. Fight kodiaks in Rathe Mountains (they were doing<br/>
good for FAerain and Anna at 18-19. if she can get a partner, I don&#39;t<br/>
think they will be too bad at 17 either.) and aviaks in Lake Ratheteer<br/>
and South karana. (Don&#39;t ask me. I like fighting aviaks.)<br/>
<br/>
What comes next:<br/>
I ordered Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get Meara [Daring] to 20 before the expansion comes out and<br/>
make her EARN that last name. (Right now, appears 20 is when Illusion:<br/>
Iksar is going to be available) She went to Sol A at level 9. I want<br/>
her to go to Kunark -- all the way down to the newbie areas -- at level<br/>
20. Once she has done this, I will deem her worthy of the name she wants.<br/>
She can hang out down there, make friends with all the newbie Iksars. And<br/>
maybe group with them as they get of age to be grouped with. Do quests,<br/>
hopefully get her faction up such that she can do some selling and not be<br/>
KoS with the guards. (Hopefully there will be a bank at the outpost.<br/>
If so, I&#39;ll make do without banking privileges in Iksar... Don&#39;t want to<br/>
be KoS in Freeport either, really... I like being able to go anywhere I<br/>
want.)<br/>
<br/>
I *think* that this is doable (getting Meara to 20), even for my rate of<br/>
leveling. It just takes actually being online and wanting to play... Faesong<br/>
got from 16 to 17 in just two nights of playing... And I think meara is<br/>
halfway to 17 already.<br/>
