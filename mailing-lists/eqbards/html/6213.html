<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848820587">for strenght items, get a platinum (7str, 7wis)  or silver ruby veil (4str,<br/>
4 wis)<br/>
earings can get cheap +3 str ones or go abit more and get +4str/+2int ones.<br/>
for rings there&#39;s electrum ruby rings that give 4sr/2wis or get something<br/>
cheaper, jagged bands are becoming more and more common too and have 3str 2<br/>
ac i think.   Dont fear your str much as the more you level the less its a<br/>
biggy.<br/>
<br/>
my base str is 85 and im up to 98 now (one of my lower stats)<br/>
my base str  with my items on me is 62 and im in full steel (visible) and<br/>
have 2 silver plated bracers (7ac, 7disease/7poison resist and weight is<br/>
minimul on em).  so right there i can loot a nice amount of stuff, but as i<br/>
said the more you level the better you&#39;ll be off, im 30 and have a box of<br/>
aku-bar (weightless items in it and holds 10 slots) and got an evil eye bag<br/>
(reduces weight 75%) so my weight rarely goes over 75 (damn coppers are<br/>
heavy)<br/>
<br/>
jewelry i have on is mostly dex/agi/charisma oriented.   you may want to get<br/>
a blackened crown to raise your str of 5 and all resists by 5 as well.  If<br/>
you can get the 2 ogre heads in butcherblock then you have a good chance of<br/>
getting a crown by completing the quest in kaladim, thats how i acquired my<br/>
crown when i had one.<br/>
<br/>
my stat boosting items are:<br/>
crested helm   (6str/3char)<br/>
oppaline earing  (5char)<br/>
4str/2int earing (4str/2int)<br/>
golden black pearl choker  (7dex/7agi i think, cant remember)<br/>
Platinum Star Ruby veil (soon to be replaced by a guise of deceiver i hope)<br/>
(9dex/9char i think)<br/>
electrum Star ruby ring (7dex/5char)<br/>
gold star ruby ring  (5dex/7char)  (one of each metal as one is 7dex 5 char<br/>
and the other is opposite)<br/>
silver plated bracers (low weight, look like plate and 7 resist<br/>
poison/disease)<br/>
cloak of the icebear (i forgot the stats)<br/>
bloodstained mantle (i forgot the stats)<br/>
<br/>
So you see most of my stuff is charisma and dex and some agi<br/>
im at 98str<br/>
119 charisma<br/>
124 dex <br/>
and 121 agi i think<br/>
<br/>
I dunno if this helps you any, but might give you ideas what to keep an eye<br/>
out for. the plat star ruby veil is much cheaper to make then the plat ruby<br/>
veil as the star ruby is only 68pp or so.<br/>
the 3str earings usually go for about 30-40pp each.  <br/>
<br/>
Dont worry too much, you will start making money, just give it time. I know<br/>
i remember vividly the high teens low 20&#39;s and i would never loot anything<br/>
but money almost cause i was always encumbered. it sucks i know but that<br/>
time will pass and you will start getting nice boosting items and the armor<br/>
you&#39;re seeking.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hail and well met fellow bards of Norrath,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I come to you today with several small problems looking for assistance and<br/>
&gt; advice.  When I first joined this list, you all seemed to think that the<br/>
&gt; major component of a bard&#39;s attributes was Charisma, so on all of the<br/>
&gt; suggestions I axed my human bard with low charisma (who&#39;s body I could not<br/>
&gt; recover anywho) and made my half-elf bard with a whopping 110 starting<br/>
&gt; charisma.  Anyway.....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That has now come back to bite me in the ass.  I am now at level 20<br/>
&gt; (FINALLY!!!!!!) and am in search of bronze plate.  Unfortunately, med<br/>
&gt; bronze seems incredibly rare (and expensive-I still haven&#39;t found the cash<br/>
&gt; cow that everyone talks about hehe) to purchase.  So I am now in<br/>
&gt; Permafrost where the bronze lives.  So now I have 3 pieces-breastplate,<br/>
&gt; sleeves (vambraces, whatever) and a mask.  Only problem is that now I am<br/>
&gt; only 10 from my total carrying weight (which is a whopping 82 buffed).  I<br/>
&gt; plan on just getting the visible pieces, minus the boots-they just seem so<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable.  With a pair of greaves, one bracer and the helm, I shan&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be able to carry anything anymore!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Here are my questions:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Please tell me of STR items it would be possible for me to get.  (I have<br/>
&gt; one ring (I forget what kind) +2, and a purity belt, and a spiked collar.)<br/>
&gt; Please bear in mind that I am poor (50pp in the bank on a good day) and I<br/>
&gt; like to live.<br/>
&gt; Also if any other people out there know off the cuff, who drops the<br/>
&gt; greaves (bronze leggings) and the bronze helm in Permafrost.  Is it a<br/>
&gt; named somebody or is it a random thing?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thank you all in advance!<br/>
