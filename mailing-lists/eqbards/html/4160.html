<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216728770">The person who brought up the Jig thing is obviously new to the list <br/>
     and thought that (s)he had some juicy info for us.  It happens. There <br/>
     is a lot of bad info out there on the net.  No need to blast the poor <br/>
     person.  As per the twinking thread, it is a very emotional issue and <br/>
     people need to vent their frustration.  It&#39;s a very human need.  I <br/>
     found it a bit boring after awhile but it is not that hard to hit the <br/>
     delete button, even 30 time.  And it is a lot more interesting then <br/>
     reading some work related e-mail.  :)<br/>

Is it me or do the same stupid subjects come back every week? Such as Jig, <br/>
people please lay this subject to rest, its been overdone, it doesnt do <br/>
squat to help the party regen rate....  And whats with the off topic stuff? <br/>
why is it that a subject will get started on a quest or an item, and next <br/>
thing you know, you get 30 more emails with the same subject but its about <br/>
favorite weapons or twinking?  come on guys, give it up. stick to quests and <br/>
stuff like that please. Some topics are great, like the rubicite threads, <br/>
the dream weapons and such, but they always take a left turn and end up <br/>
being a huge spam of the ol inbox about twinking and irrelevant stuff. I get <br/>
in the morning and read about 7 or 8 emails, and delete well over 40 emails, <br/>
thats not including the ones i delete during the day.<br/>

&gt;      Ummm...  This has been thoroughly researched by many of us on this <br/>
&gt;      list.  It seems to effect how often the bar is refreshed but does not <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      actually improve the speed of mana regeneration.  We have conducted <br/>
&gt;      many tests with stopwatches and such.  In fact we have beat the <br/>
&gt;      subject to death..  (he he)  It doesn&#39;t help at all.  Period.  We <br/>
&gt; WISH <br/>
&gt;      it did, in fact it would be a great way to cure the level 15 to 32 no <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      one wants to party with Bards blues but, sigh, it is not to be. Trust <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      us, that web site is wrong.<br/>

&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful... <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate for <br/>
&gt; all <br/>
&gt; three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6 <br/>
&gt; sec/pulse.  <br/>
&gt; So what? Well, what this means is: <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; - If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana <br/>
&gt; regen <br/>
&gt;   (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
&gt; - If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should <br/>
&gt; increase at the <br/>
&gt;   same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even <br/>
&gt; more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this <br/>
&gt; information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>
&gt; Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-) <br/>
