spell on yourself, you can cancel it at any time by left clicking on the<br/>
icon. You cannot rid bad effects or any effects that someone else places on<br/>
you. Same holds true for our songs when special circumstances arise.<br/>

8)Don&#39;t use the levitation song within a dungeon.  There is a<br/>
8)bug, or Verant<br/>
8)calls it FEATURE, that let MOBS hit you from anywhere while you are<br/>
8)levitating.  Actually for us is better since we can stop the<br/>
8)song and land<br/>
8)anytime we want.  But for the other classes, they have to<br/>
8)wait until the<br/>
8)spell wears out.  Druid friends also told me not to use it<br/>
8)over water, since<br/>
8)shark can hit you from anywhere and there is no way to fight<br/>
8)back when you<br/>
8)are above water.  I guess it is only for the spell not the<br/>
8)song, we could<br/>
8)always drop down into water anytime we want.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)&gt;<br/>
8)&gt;Well, I finally got out of the first level of hell, and was<br/>
8)able to try the<br/>
8)&gt;song I had prebought two weeks prior to hitting 31,<br/>
8)Agilmente&#39;s Aria of<br/>
8)&gt;Eagles.  Boy was it nice.  Not only did it levitate me, but<br/>
8)when it pulses<br/>
8)&gt;it actually raises you up a bit, so when it pulses during<br/>
8)the highest point<br/>
8)&gt;of the wavey motion, it actually lifts you higher.  I took it through<br/>
8)&gt;Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, soaring past the aqua goblin camp, and<br/>
8)paying no heed to<br/>
8)&gt;the steep cliffs.  I entered Unrest and floated around in<br/>
8)the outside a<br/>
8)&gt;bit.<br/>
8)&gt;I perched atop the small island to the right next to the gazebo, and<br/>
8)&gt;attempted to fly over to the door&#39;s canopy.  I didn&#39;t quite<br/>
8)make it, and no<br/>
8)&gt;sooner was I simultaneously attacked by a Greater Dark Bone,<br/>
8)a Tentacle<br/>
8)&gt;Terror, and a Dark Terror from the depths of the basement.<br/>
8)These were no<br/>
8)&gt;where to be seen, but my text box was spammed with red.  My<br/>
8)health quickly<br/>
8)&gt;dropped, and despite my efforts to flee, my pursuers were<br/>
8)always right on<br/>
8)&gt;my<br/>
8)&gt;tail.  I eventually fell to their blows and received a birds<br/>
8)eye view of my<br/>
8)&gt;corpse while I loaded to my home point.  Rather than being in the<br/>
8)&gt;courtyard,<br/>
8)&gt;as I was when I died, my corpse was in a cavernous very<br/>
8)basement like area.<br/>
8)&gt;Seems as I was floating serenely around unrest I was really floating<br/>
8)&gt;noisily<br/>
8)&gt;down in the basement and disturbing the peace of some very<br/>
8)nasty creatures<br/>
8)&gt;that dwell therein.  Three hours later, after delving fully<br/>
8)invis into the<br/>
8)&gt;basement scouring it&#39;s entirety for my corpse, locating it<br/>
8)through a wall,<br/>
8)&gt;and dealing with a very uncooperative guide (who said it was VERY<br/>
8)&gt;retreivable and levitation worked just fine) it was summoned<br/>
8)to me, and I<br/>
8)&gt;went about my merry way.  The point of this story is to ask<br/>
8)at any attempts<br/>
8)&gt;at an explanation as to why this happened, and how I can safely use<br/>
8)&gt;levitation.  It really is a blast as I thought it would be,<br/>
8)but who knows<br/>
8)&gt;what mischeif and trouble I could get myself into in other<br/>
8)multi level<br/>
8)&gt;dungeons.  So, sorry for rambling, but has anyone else<br/>
8)experienced this,<br/>
8)&gt;and<br/>
8)&gt;does anyone want to venture an explanation?<br/>
