<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063343461">You mean, the &quot;working as intended per the sock puppet&quot; song.  <br/>
Actually, this is kinda funny.  But, you have to admit our songs do <br/>
have funny names.  Haven&#39;t you ever listened to the radio and someone <br/>
will call in and say play that one song by Soandso.  DJ says, &quot;sing <br/>
it.&quot;  Hey!  Now that&#39;s an idea!  Next time they say &quot;play mana song,&quot; <br/>
tell them to say the name of the song or try singing it themselves <br/>
first, LOL! :p<br/>
