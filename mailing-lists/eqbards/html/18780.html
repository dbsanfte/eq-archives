<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106746268">I&#39;d be perfectly happy to accept the lower AC if the effects given were in<br/>
any way in balance to those gained by the other classes.  Point is they are<br/>
not, in fact they patently suck.  <br/>
<br/>
Being able to Summon Food and Water is totally a joke.  It would be a joke<br/>
if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>
insulting.  I&#39;m not sure how anyone could reasonably defend that it is<br/>
really useful to have at 50+.  What do we have now, Verant clones?  Please.<br/>
Why would characters who have been leaving behind 5pp weapons for 10+ levels<br/>
because they were trash loot suddenly care about 6cp muffins and milk?<br/>
Great, now we can save everyone in our party 1.2 sp a day, whoopee.<br/>
<br/>
Enduring Breath is minorly useful.  Is it anywhere near as useful as +25 STR<br/>
or Invisibility is to a warrior?  No.<br/>
<br/>
I am more irritated by the overall combo than just the AC points.  It shows<br/>
the usual lack of any kind of thought when it comes to the bard class.  We<br/>
aren&#39;t a tank so we get lower armor.  How does this mesh with giving us a<br/>
weapon that reduces our level on the hate list?  If we aren&#39;t a tank why<br/>
should we need a weapon to reduce hate?  It certainly won&#39;t help if we<br/>
aren&#39;t up there mixing it up.<br/>

snip &gt;I think some of us are losing sight of what the bard class is.  We&#39;re<br/>
traveling minstrels, not warriors.  Symphonic Harmony proc (Evade) and<br/>
<br/>
Guys, we&#39;re a support class not warriors remember?<br/>
