<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659761318"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This example was taken from Unrest but it has also<br/>
&gt; happened to me once in Beholder and I have read<br/>
&gt; that it occurs in almost every other dungeon also.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another notable place this happens is the Mino caves in Steamfront. It&#39;s not<br/>
z-axis but side to side in large distances. Maldrath or whatever his name<br/>
is, seems to be able to cast a spell on you from his little spot no matter<br/>
where you are in the caves.</div>
