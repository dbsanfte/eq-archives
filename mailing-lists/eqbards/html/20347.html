<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010423741">Yah true.  But it&#39;s a melee page.  And since we don&#39;t strictly fit his<br/>
definition of &quot;melee&quot; perhaps his wording was wrong.  I doubt that he is<br/>
totally clueless about bards.  His understanding that we aren&#39;t exactly gods<br/>
at melee is fairly indicative that he at least has passing knowledge about<br/>
how a bard works.<br/>

&gt; sarcasm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m fully aware that it&#39;s our songs that define our class and my songs are<br/>
&gt; memorised dynamically to compliment the abilities of the group I&#39;m in.<br/>
&gt; Depending on the make-up of the group, I&#39;m almost exclusively singing with<br/>
&gt; an instrument equipped during combat, hot-swapping and twisting as<br/>
&gt; necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Defining characteristic or not, at lower levels (up to the mid-teens and<br/>
&gt; often beyond) a Bard&#39;s time is spent meleeing whilst singing.  To dismiss<br/>
&gt; Bards from melee discussion because it &quot;doesn&#39;t define us&quot; perhaps shows a<br/>
&gt; lack of comprehension of a Bard&#39;s abilities and how one is played.<br/>
