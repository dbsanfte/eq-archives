<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045249100">i understand your position, i just don&#39;t know how many people it applies to.<br/>
i actually am enjoying this discussion, i like debating intelligently,<br/>
without getting TOO offensive =)  and damn it really got this list going, i<br/>
haven&#39;t even been able to read the other posts like the bard letter to GZ<br/>

&gt; true but it has obviously been a small percentage of your <br/>
&gt; actual playing<br/>
&gt; time as evidenced by your levels.  Your lowest level <br/>
&gt; character probably has<br/>
&gt; more playing time than my highest.  Dying for me doesn&#39;t just <br/>
&gt; mean running<br/>
&gt; across some zones and back to playing.  It often means <br/>
&gt; running across some<br/>
&gt; zones and quitting for the night. </span></blockquote></div>
