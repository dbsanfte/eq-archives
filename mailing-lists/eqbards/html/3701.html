<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494992023">Hehhe, in my original reply - I think something has been misunderstood<br/>
along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not against helping a new character a LITTLE - little patchwork, maybe<br/>
a mino axe (easy and cheap enough to come by) few plat to ease the initial<br/>
startup pain - and knowing an area is a HUGE plus on a second character.<br/>
<br/>
I was outraged by lvl 1&#39;s in better stuff than I expect to have at lvl 30,<br/>
maybe even 40.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just over the top. Now, if they had this stuff - and banked it for a<br/>
few levels, I wouldn&#39;t have NEARLY as much trouble with that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just amazed Verant found a way for it not to matter all that much - as<br/>
I see these guys dead on a regular basis. It&#39;s nice to know character<br/>
development apparently counts for a LOT more than &#39;stuff&#39;, even stuff as<br/>
nice as that.<br/>

&gt;Oh the difference a little twinking can make though...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The first bard that I started was a poor lad that barely made enough in loot<br/>
&gt;sales to buy his new song each level.. and perhaps like a fool I would<br/>
&gt;always buy the song as soon as a leveled. I was endlessly walking around in<br/>
&gt;cloth or patchwork armor, with my trusty tarnished hatchet, and my exotic<br/>
&gt;small wooden shield, dying often, and dreaming of the day I would be able to<br/>
&gt;buy a single leather gorget.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My second bard was lucky enough to receive the gift of mino axe and small<br/>
&gt;shield at level one from a friendly ranger. It was like night and day.<br/>
&gt;Killing stuff was much easier, my death to lvl ratio hit the floor, and I<br/>
&gt;was soon buying extra containers (backpack, sacks, etc.) just so I could<br/>
&gt;increase the efficiency of my killing/looting binges. By lvl 5 I had a full<br/>
&gt;set of leather, and was comfortably adventuring to places that my original<br/>
&gt;bard had been afraid to venture at lvl 8.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, being very familiar with greater faydark and the surrounding<br/>
&gt;areas may have made the second bard easier to play as well.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Think thats bad?  I saw a low level Half Elf female, also<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; toting full bronze<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and weilding a demon claw,  I really hate seeing this around.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Although,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; little bit of twinking I do is whenever I see a brand new<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bard in the guild<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I hand him/her 2plat to let them get the songs and whatever<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; else they need.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Another person did the same for me at level 1 ).<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am on a mission today for STR increasing items (my base STR<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; is 75 eeeuoo).<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have heard people like Shada talk about a purity belt.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; What is it, how<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; much is it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; rubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and yet is light?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Is mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard many<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; wearing it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; EROLLISI MARR!!!!!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; full suit of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to him, nice<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; gift.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; about 3 days<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; gates than<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted a 2H<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; him how to say<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; thank you.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just bent<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; so there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; way I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>
