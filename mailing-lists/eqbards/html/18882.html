<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Some Guk questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087150371">I finally dragged Elfson away from Kunark (went from 20-26 in about two<br/>
weeks!).  Feeling confident, (25 was the first level I reached without<br/>
dying since 5, 26 was the second) I began my search for some lambent<br/>
armor.  After some unsuccesful searching, I decided to come here with<br/>
some questions...<br/>
<br/>
Basically with all these peices, I&#39;d like to know is there a specific<br/>
mob (IE the Shin Knight down the hall from the preist room) or will any<br/>
mob of that type drop the item I need.  Also any other advice you could<br/>
offer for getting them would be great. (like where to find them) (Most<br/>
of these peices are out my reach right now, but my guild has lots of mid<br/>
30&#39;s casters dying to get me to 32, so they are very eager to help me<br/>
get my lambent, (I assume they want me to get my butt back to ROK for<br/>
more levels))<br/>
<br/>
Dark Boned Bracelets (Greater DB skelly in Unrest)<br/>
Shin Greaves (Shin Knight, upper guk)<br/>
Shin Gauntlets (Ghoul Shin Knight, lower guk)<br/>
<br/>
Also since I am in Guk, I am trying to get the Mask of the Deceiver. <br/>
The person camping it on Saturday was willing to let me loot it, but I<br/>
could never find the room.  How do you ge there?  Will I make it with<br/>
invisibility?<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks for the help :)<br/>
