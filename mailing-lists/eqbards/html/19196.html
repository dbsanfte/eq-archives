Sorry to burst your bubble, but bards do not get an effective 2hs or 2hb.<br/>
They can equip some weapons and can hit greens and see some nice numbers<br/>
but....  blues and higher will skill check and you will not be able to hit<br/>
very well at all.  Bardic losre says it&#39;s left over from beta days when<br/>
bards had 2hs and 2hb but it was taken away by simply capping the skills at<br/>
level 1.<br/>
<br/>
Try smacking some blues - have Selos memmed though!  Good luck, good hunting<br/>
and keep us posted on your adventures!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Giant Grub Digger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This guy just gave me a Giant Grub Digger (12dam/47dly, +20HP, +5<br/>
&gt; SVDisease), *2HS* weapon that can be wielded by bards!  Now, last<br/>
&gt; time I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a<br/>
&gt; skill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards<br/>
&gt; anyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this<br/>
&gt; is not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because<br/>
&gt; Bards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time<br/>
&gt; I do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war<br/>
&gt; song, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able<br/>
&gt; to establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT<br/>
&gt; soloing weapon!<br/>
