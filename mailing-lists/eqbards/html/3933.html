<b>Subject:</b> Another note on Sirens, Pixie Strike <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-198425534">I played around with Sirens a bit more.  Charming a creature<br/>
clears its damage list.  Yeah, the one that determines who<br/>
gets the kill.  The person who does the most damage between<br/>
when the creature is uncharmed and when it dies gets the kill.<br/>
This has implications both for anti-kill stealing and kill<br/>
stealing.  A friend remarked that a bard was kill-stealing<br/>
from his group earlier.  Now we know how.<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike does not have a memory blur effect I&#39;d read about<br/>
somewhere.  When the mob becomes unmesmerized, it makes a<br/>
beeline straight for you, just like with Lullaby.  It could be<br/>
that everyone except the bard is removed from the hate list,<br/>
but you will not be able to use this song to get an annoying<br/>
green mob to leave you alone.  You still need an enchanter for<br/>
that.  It is single target only, so if you need to heal up in<br/>
the middle of a one-on-one fight, weave Strike and Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
Brag:  I found a mob that I can (barely) solo at L27 (28 now),<br/>
gives good experience, and great loot.  I made about 100pp in<br/>
just under two hours this morning soloing, half of which was<br/>
running back and forth from town overloaded with loot because<br/>
I can carry only 8 pounds before I&#39;m encumbered. :-P<br/>
