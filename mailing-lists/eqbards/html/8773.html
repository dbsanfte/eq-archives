<b>Subject:</b> RE: Gypsy Lute? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-486134515">It looks like some tests are warranted on the new gypsy lute before it gets<br/>
turned in for the quest to see if it enhances songs that use the lute.  Lets<br/>
hope the tests come out positive.  Would be nice, although highly unlikely,<br/>
if that +5 magic resist that the gypsy lute gives is given to all party<br/>
members when the lute is played.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So it appears there is a Lute of the Gypsy Princess and now a Gypsy Lute.<br/>
&gt; The screenshot of the gypsy lute says +5 Sv Magic which makes me want one<br/>
&gt; simply for that fact.  I&#39;d be curious if anyone gets their hands on this,<br/>
&gt; if maybe this is the equal to the Mistmoore Battle drum (I know this is<br/>
&gt; probably just a fantasy. . . but hey, this is a fantasy game huh? =).<br/>
