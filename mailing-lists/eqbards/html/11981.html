&gt; Brazen Brass Kilij? sure I know the damage is good on it, but the<br/>
&gt; WEIGHT! What are you a Barbarian Bard? (totally skipping the part about<br/>
&gt; how rare the low level SG is and how he is instantly mobbed by everyone<br/>
&gt; who /cons him and says &quot;hrmm, that SG is even to me!&quot; AND the fact that<br/>
&gt; according to sceeen shots posted here his name is NOT &quot;sand giant&quot; but<br/>
&gt; &quot;a sand giant&quot; just like all the other sand giants in the desert).<br/>

&gt; 35th Bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>
Uldar  believe  it or not, I saw &quot;a sand giant&quot;  not 30 minutes in the zone-<br/>
it     conned  blue, but as I   am having  terrible LD problems lately, I<br/>
shouted for help-a nearby lvl 40 SK killed it-then said to me- he&#39;s got<br/>
plans on him you want em?!.......uhhhhhhh........YEAH! :)<br/>
Got the  plans, got the gold, friend enchanted gold for me, got the BBK.<br/>
All in about an hour and a half.-only thing  is I hate the look of<br/>
scimitars- could they  make em any bigger?<br/>
As for Staff of W., im saving my cash for  gems  for my armor- and I&#39;m one<br/>
of them poor bards :).-Someday-<br/>
