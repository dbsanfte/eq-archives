<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010317082">I am so sorry it took me this long to reply, last week an impending sale of<br/>
company suddenly went through and I was without a computer...  I finally got<br/>
my new one hooked up and I have 354 emails!!!!  I hope people have answered<br/>
your questions already...<br/>
<br/>
In any case at level 26 I&#39;d stay in Lake of Ill Omen.  You can solo there<br/>
(especially around the skeleton in the south) or get a group for the sarnak<br/>
fort or goblin mine.  There are so many nice spawns there.  If you get bored<br/>
there go to Warsilk Wood and fight the forest giants.<br/>
<br/>
At 28 or so head towards frontier mts for the mountain giants.  You wont<br/>
believe how much money you make.  Another option around 28-30 are the<br/>
driders in Firona Vie.<br/>
<br/>
If you can a dungeon capable group anytime after 25, Dalinar&#39;s is the place<br/>
to be.  Just know that corpse retrival is horrendus as there are basically<br/>
no safe spots and the only exits (after level 1) are teleporters...<br/>
Weee!!!!</div>
