<div id="ygrps-yiv-614495386">Heh - have not heard anything about HS on our server.  One of our bards<br/>
picked his way in (before they changed that) and was greeted by the zone<br/>
mobs.  A GM summoned him out because he was not supposed to be able to get<br/>
in.  Suladan can elaborate &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile.....<br/>
<br/>
Old Sebilis is a high level dungeon that requires a key to get in.  To get<br/>
the key you need to camp 2 different blue to 51 froogs that are pretty darn<br/>
mean.  Also, they trigger spawn the named mobs for the zone. And you need to<br/>
kill the names to get more of the Forager and Hunter Froogs to spawn.  Then<br/>
you take these no drop lore items to a npc in a cave behind some specs and<br/>
he makes a key for you.  I have 2 keys.  Carry one and one in bank (where I<br/>
am binded in FV).  Also its a one-way zone in.  The teleporter out is some<br/>
dozen or so mobs away.<br/>
<br/>
The zone into Seb is benign (unless train by the zone in campers) and you<br/>
can ease you way in.  A simple 2 blues to pull (or lament one).  Then 4<br/>
more. Then a group of 3.  Then the bridge area and possible patrollers who<br/>
are even or higher cons ro 51.  Then the fun begins.  On the top floor, you<br/>
can clear to the zone out and camp off there for exp (also zone in is camped<br/>
for exp).  Then there are 3 ways you can go deeper (and stay on the top<br/>
floor): to the Chef, the Emperor or the Commander (and the Pickler).<br/>
<br/>
We went to see the chef one night and had 3 to 4 groups.  We were doing fine<br/>
and set up for the Chef.  Stuff happened and 18 ppl died.  The six who lived<br/>
and those who had 2nd keys went back in.  They died trying to clear back to<br/>
where we were. Now we have 24 nekkid ppl who need keys to get back in.  Heh,<br/>
we camped the Froager and Hunter and got keys for everyone, went back in and<br/>
summoned corpses.<br/>
<br/>
Six hours of CR. Some folks had to eat exp on 2 deaths, everyone ate exp on<br/>
at least one death.  Alot of folks are not going to like these keyed<br/>
dungeons - a bunch already dont like them.  On the other hand, I have been<br/>
in all of the top floor now - sometimes with only 1 group of 6 - sometimes<br/>
with only 2.  Evac plays an important role - very important.  You can evac<br/>
out to the Emerald Jungle and run back to TT and Old Seb easily.  It&#39;<br/>

&gt; Howling Stones is super high level dungeon that requires each person in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; group to have a key to get inside.  To get a key you supposedly have to<br/>
spend a<br/>
&gt; lot of time camping a greenie mob.<br/>

&gt; Howling Stones for Breastplates perhaps?  Has anyone actually explored<br/>
&gt; Howling Stones at all yet that anyone knows of?<br/>
