<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952829213">I tried to help a ranger get a dirk off Dvinn  (I already had mine, as did<br/>
the enchanter I usually group with).   We fought Dvinn 7 times, and he had a<br/>
heart 3 times, dark elf parts the other 4.  No Dirk. Suffice to say the<br/>
ranger was a little perturbed.  Of course he had no idea on the stats of the<br/>
dirk at the time, he was actually only killing him for his heart.<br/>

&gt; People don&#39;t sell the Dragoon Dirk for nearly as cheap now, (I found out<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; myself) because now Dvinn does not always have the Dagger on him.  You<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; to kill him 3 or more times to get one these days. I managed to get one<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; 30plat.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hang out just outside Crushbone, they usually will loot<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dvinn, run outside and auction it, I have seen them sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 10 pp.  You might get lucky.  The dragoon&#39;s dirk is<br/>
&gt; &gt; better than almost any combine/well balanced weapon.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would not waste any money on the store bought variety,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Demon claws are nice, but very expensive, and so is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; PGT,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While the dirk by all means should be your first magic weapon,<br/>
&gt; the combines are still a good choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are around L10 and have managed to save enough for a<br/>
&gt; combine and can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to make the trek to Crushbone for<br/>
&gt; a dirk, by all means buy one.  You should be able to sell it<br/>
&gt; later to a player for a profit, or to a merchant at a 10%-15%<br/>
&gt; loss, so they do not really cost as much as their price<br/>
&gt; indicates.  While the dirk has dropped the bottom out of the<br/>
&gt; combine rapier market, the combine longsword and scimitar<br/>
&gt; markets are still doing well because several classes that can<br/>
&gt; use those but cannot use the dirk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are L17 or higher and already have a dirk, a combine<br/>
&gt; for your off hand can be a good choice for the same reason.<br/>
&gt; If you ever upgrade your off-hand weapon, you can easily<br/>
&gt; liquidate the combine and get 80%-90% of your money back (more<br/>
&gt; if you sell it to a player).  Unless you need the money *now*<br/>
&gt; for something else, most combines only end up costing 5-10pp<br/>
&gt; to own.<br/>
