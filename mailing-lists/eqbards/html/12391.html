<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995883104">The other day in Kelethin a level 6 bard twink offered to buy every piece of<br/>
lambent armor I was wearing ( I have complete set minus 2 pieces).  He offered<br/>
me a helluva lot of money for it all.  I laughed in his face.  Told him that I<br/>
had been working on completing the quests ever since they came out in the patch.<br/>
No way was I gonna sell it and do the quests all over again.  He bumped his<br/>
offer by 1000PP.  Put him on the /ignore list.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was running through EC on my way to Solusek Temple to complete the<br/>
lambent breastplate quest.  Someone was auctioning a lambent breastplate for<br/>
sell.  Sent him a /tell that I was interested in knowing his asking price.  He<br/>
said 3000-5000 PP or items of equal trade. Also told me that he had already sold<br/>
three breastplates for that price.  I would have thought that they sold for no<br/>
more than 1000PP.  Only cost me 270PP to buy the two rubies.  Guess these newbie<br/>
bard twinks have a lot of money to throw around.  <br/>
