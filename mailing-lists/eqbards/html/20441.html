<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477628237">sigh, yes i agree as well.  you don&#39;t think i know all this?  i knew i would<br/>
get completely misunderstood.  my simple point was that we are more<br/>
effective by singing songs that increase the effectiveness of the group<br/>
while killing high level mobs, rather than singing damage songs.  but IF you<br/>
feel the need to do damage you should probably use weapons instead of songs.<br/>
if you are singing damage songs, you are not singing buffs.  i did say this<br/>
many times, and thanks Lyrnia for taking it as an argument instead of an<br/>
intelligent discussion.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Agreed Sylly, which is exactly what most of us have been <br/>
&gt; saying.  The &quot;most<br/>
&gt; effective&quot; bard isn&#39;t one that locks themselves into one <br/>
&gt; pattern of play.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;Most effective&quot; bard is the bard that knows when to put <br/>
&gt; the weapons<br/>
&gt; away and use a different tactic.  Sometimes you just dont <br/>
&gt; WANT to be up<br/>
&gt; there swinging away.  It all depends on your situation, group <br/>
&gt; makeup, mob<br/>
&gt; makeup, level, etc.  A truely effective bard understands that <br/>
&gt; there is never<br/>
&gt; any one way to handle a situation and an extremely effective <br/>
&gt; bard knows<br/>
&gt; which methods to use for each situation that comes up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Done arguing this thread myself ;)  It&#39;s turning into a <br/>
&gt; &#39;tastes great&#39;,<br/>
&gt; &#39;less filling&#39; thread.<br/>
