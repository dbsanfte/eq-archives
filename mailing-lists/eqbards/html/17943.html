<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316197819">My guild went to Everlost last night and took a swim under the ice.  Found a<br/>
cave and after our pally gave the skelly something we killed this other guy<br/>
Miragul (sp?) something to help our pally do some kinda quest.  After that,<br/>
we went up to the Plane of Sky and started working on getting to I4  - guess<br/>
his quest is up there.  I forgot to try charm on the Sky Princess but soon<br/>
enough had a go at an azarack.<br/>
<br/>
Me and Suladan (48 bard) tried to charm aza&#39;s.  100% resist. 100% taunt.<br/>
100% dead.  Meanwhile, a lev 50 enchanter stuck mez on one so looks like the<br/>
bard uber-charm is gone but aza&#39;s are now mezz-able.  Things were kinda<br/>
scattered and we shoulda done better clearing azaracks as we have cleared em<br/>
in one pass before but this time we fought until we were all dead.  Anyhow,<br/>
we were staging in Gfay for CorpseRecovery when the freaking GM event starts<br/>
up and soon  180, 190, 200 ppl are in the zone.  Then 205, 210 and at<br/>
215.....<br/>
<br/>
You have been disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
Login and find songs unmemmed due to restoring to a previous save. Then,<br/>
disconnected.  Re-log, rinse, repeat. This goes on for way too long and<br/>
finally it dawns on us to run to Lfay.  We CR and clear the rest of the<br/>
aza&#39;s.  Then its 3 hours longer than I should have stayed and I jumped off.<br/>
Read this morning that one of our druids has stuff to complete a quest -<br/>
might be a first for our server.  What a night - ugh.<br/>

&gt; Hot off the www.eqvault.com presses:  I guess we can&#39;t complain as long as<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a REASONABLE Cap!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Today&#39;s patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that was put<br/>
&gt; in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped. Someone was<br/>
kind<br/>
&gt; enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a *really nice* pet named<br/>
&gt; Cazic-Thule.<br/>
