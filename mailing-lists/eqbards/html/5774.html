<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677989702"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This seems kind of odd that the 1st level spell is better than the 24/29/34<br/>
&gt; spell.  What are the differences between the two other than time and mana.<br/>
&gt; I wonder if these 24/29/34 level druid spells are the druid equivalent of<br/>
&gt; the Libretto and Teleport songs, i.e. almost worthless?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Essentially. About 60% of the druid spells are the equivalent of those two<br/>
songs. For a while there was a druid DOT that was less efficient that a<br/>
DD.<br/>

A lot of people tend to think that Ensnare is resisted less than Snare.<br/>
However, I think Ensnare just comes at a temporary difficult time when for<br/>
some reason Snare is resisted a lot. A few levels later, snare usually<br/>
catches on the first try.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have number handy, but I know people who&#39;ve done testing of it<br/>
(about 100 castings per) and found that Ensnare is resisted /slightly/<br/>
less (like 15%), but since the effect is useless because it runs out after<br/>
&lt; 10 seconds, the resist rate is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
How about &#39;Sense Animals&#39;? =)</div>
