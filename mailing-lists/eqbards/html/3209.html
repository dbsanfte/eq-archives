<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146603913">No it is not worth 500pp.  It is worth about 300pp.  This is the coolest<br/>
weapon in the game for a bard.  Yesterday I traded my Tomahawk for the claw<br/>
and I was doing more dmg than before because with Anthem and Warsong I was<br/>
hitting with non stop.  To also answer earlier question as to which weapon<br/>
is better: Tomahawk or Barbed whip?  Neither.  I would get a tomahawk then<br/>
trade it for the claw.  One, it looks cool and it is a lot lighter than a<br/>
Tomahawk and a lot faster too.  For a bard, speed is everything in this<br/>
game.  I hoped this help.<br/>

Anyways, is a demon claw worth 500 pp? It&#39;s a dam 5 delay 19 weapon and<br/>
comes off the Avatar of Fear in Cazic. <br/>
I don&#39;t want to shell out my entire bank just because it&#39;s the loot of a<br/>
high level creature.<br/>
