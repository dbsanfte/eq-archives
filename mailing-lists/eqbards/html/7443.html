<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-445882097"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;NPCs will never be given the ability to bind.  This would kill &quot;Binding for <br/>
&gt;donations at gates&quot;, and the sale of binds.  Verant does not want to do <br/>
&gt;this (In fact in the Policies and Procedures manual for Guides it forbids <br/>
&gt;Guides from binding players because it would &#39;damage the economy of players <br/>
&gt;selling binds&#39;).  NPCs binding would lower caster&#39;s value to the <br/>
&gt;non-casters in Norrath and eliminate a point of player interaction, Verant <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t want that either.  I&#39;ve got a 14th level Enchanter and I bind for <br/>
&gt;free all the time even though I could use the cash.  Why?  Because I like <br/>
&gt;that feeling I get when some 10th level player say &quot;Hey, thanks a lot!!&quot; <br/>
&gt;when I turn down his 2gp that he&#39;s trying to donate.  NPCs binding would <br/>
&gt;eliminate that four thousands of players.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get bound over a dozen times a week.  I have never paid for one, nor have <br/>
I ever been asked to.  I don&#39;t honestly believe this to be a valid reason <br/>
why NPCs could not sell binds.  Say for instance the NPC binds for 5 or <br/>
10pp... players could still underbid.  Those like you who just want to help <br/>
people and feel good still could.  Having said that, I hear people all the <br/>
time auctioning free binds.  While this occurs, those selling binds will <br/>
find little, if any, business.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bind anywhere?  Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably <br/>
&gt;lucky to have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing <br/>
&gt;when fighting uber-mobs like dragons.  &quot;Yeah, I lost a level dying 14 times <br/>
&gt;while fighting Vox, but I would just spawn, mem my spells and nuke until I <br/>
&gt;got killed.&quot;  This is precicely why Ressurection effects have been made so <br/>
&gt;horrendous.  Probably casters being able to bind anywhere was to offset how <br/>
&gt;fragile they are should the group get overrun by mobs.  The casters are the <br/>
&gt;least likely to make it to the zone alive in a bad situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must respectfully disagree.  In my experience, casters die less than other <br/>
group members due to their ability to evac in times of crisis.  Gate is a <br/>
phenomenally potent spell.  I think casters&#39; ability to bind themselves in <br/>
cities is unbalanced, and unfair to all other classes.  I think that <br/>
casters&#39; ability to bind themselves in non-city zones is a bad joke.  I have <br/>
been hunting lately in the Ocean of Tears - an excellent example of how <br/>
unbalanced this policy is.  My cleric and enchanter friends simply bind <br/>
themselves to Errolisi, while I must return from Freeport, wait for the <br/>
boat, and (hopefully) I will be back within 30 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; it&#39;s a very <br/>
&gt;important part of the game.  Many people make the &quot;game fun&quot; or the &quot;I can <br/>
&gt;only play two hours a week&quot; argument, but when you consider the impact that <br/>
&gt;binding anywhere would have on group dynamics and strategy, you quickly see <br/>
&gt;that it works best the way that it is.  Verant has decided that getting to <br/>
&gt;your corpse, in addition to the experience lost is what that penalty is.  <br/>
&gt;When there is a penalty for dying you coordinate your actions and fight <br/>
&gt;with more strategy.  Verant (and I) want this VERY much.  Conversely, if <br/>
&gt;there were little or no penalty for dying, sloppy unbalanced groups would <br/>
&gt;just go into a place like Mistmoore with little or no regard of how the <br/>
&gt;zone works.  They&#39;d just pull the castle and beat on stuff until everything <br/>
&gt;was dead with the minor annoyance of having to loot their corpses.  I <br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be addicted to that game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There must be a penalty, and there is, over and above the need to run to <br/>
one&#39;s corpse: experience loss.  I don&#39;t know about you, but it is seriously <br/>
distressing to me when I die a few times (argh!) and lose a weeks&#39; work.  <br/>
Moreover, the ability to bind in cities (or to pay NPCs for the same) would <br/>
do nothing to negate the difficulty and duration of these runs to recover <br/>
corpses.  If I die in a non-city zone I will still be forced to run the same <br/>
distance to my body whether I was bound by myself, an NPC, or a caster.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have never had the problems that you describe getting a bind.  Getting <br/>
&gt;bound in Erudin can be tough, as that continent is currently underutilized. <br/>
&gt;  There are only two types out there now.  Newbie Erudite players that are <br/>
&gt;trying to get up to level 4 or 6 or so before going to Qeynos where the <br/>
&gt;real action is, and higher level Druid types running out to Kerra Isle for <br/>
&gt;a questing reason that I won&#39;t disclose here.  However, since nothing is <br/>
&gt;really going on out there I never really need a bind out there.  Paineel is <br/>
&gt;due to open in the next few weeks.  It is a higher level zone built off of <br/>
&gt;Tox Forrest.  Erudin is likely to get a lot busier soon, and when it does <br/>
&gt;Kerra Isle will also probably start being used for its intended purpose (a <br/>
&gt;teens level zone) instead of just having 6 high level druids in it.  I <br/>
&gt;would personally never sit for two hours waiting for a bind.  I&#39;d continue <br/>
&gt;to solicit binds if people didn&#39;t show up within five or ten minutes.  11pm <br/>
&gt;Mountain?  I routinely play until 3am Central and I never have problems <br/>
&gt;getting binds in the major cities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am truly happy that you never have this problem.  I play on E&#39;ci, one of <br/>
the oldest and most crowded servers.  Last night, for example, I arrived in <br/>
Qeynos, supposedly the Trading Hub of Antonica (so we are told), at midnight <br/>
PST.  Searching through both city zones, I found not one person who could <br/>
cast bind (nobody was anonymous, so I was able to easily ascertain that <br/>
nobody could help me).  This has happened to me on numerous occasions in the <br/>
past, sometimes in Qeynos and Rivervale, quite often (more than 50% of the <br/>
time) in Kaladim and Halas, and every time (8 visits to date) in Erudin.  In <br/>
fact, I have longed to explore Odus for several months now, and have only <br/>
given it a cursory examination because I can never find anyone capable of <br/>
binding me there.  No casters over 14th level, and often I am the only <br/>
person in Erudin or one of 2 or 3.  I also am hopeful that the new zones <br/>
(coming in a few months) will add some vitality to Odus&#39; straggling <br/>
popluation, but these do nothing to address either my existing inability to <br/>
even explore there nor the fact that many other cities share the same <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I travel frequently, and quite enjoy it.  I want to have the freedom to go <br/>
to any city in the world and be bound, even if I am the only one there.  I <br/>
would prefer it if bards were able to bind, as I feel we are not <br/>
substantially different in our design from druids, shamans, and clerics, but <br/>
I would be satisfied if NPCs could bind me.  The current state of affairs is <br/>
ridiculous, clearly offering casters a level of security and convenience no <br/>
other class can match.<br/>
