<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-233179330">Well I considered that argument and promptly rejected it after we ran a<br/>
simple test.  The enchanter can cast Breeze on themself and keep a group of<br/>
4 mobs that are even cons, mezzed forever.  The resist rate isn&#39;t high<br/>
enough to give them much trouble since it&#39;s below 10% and the mez lasts<br/>
longer than it takes to med back the mana.<br/>
<br/>
I then tried the same tactic with lullaby.  6 greater heals later I gave up.<br/>
Lullaby met with about 40% success on the even cons.  That means it reduced<br/>
damage by 40%.  Largo&#39;s reduces damage by 30%, is seldom resisted, and<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop reducing damage when someone smacks the target.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want 90% success.  If it worked 75%of the time on even cons at high<br/>
charisma Lullaby would be viable.  Not as good as an enchanter by any means<br/>
since it lasts 6 seconds, it&#39;s all you can do if you keep them mezzed other<br/>
than swing waking up the one you are hitting.  It doesn&#39;t even begin to make<br/>
enchanters obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
Its duration of one tick should be more than enough to balance it out.  Add<br/>
a higher resist rate than enchanters and it would still be ok.  I certainly<br/>
don&#39;t recall anyone ever claiming it was ridiculously powerful back when it<br/>
did work 85% of the time.  Nobody claimed that enchanters were made obsolete<br/>
by this.  This song used to be very useful and got me into quite a few<br/>
groups from level 15-18.  Since it has been broken I  have used it combat<br/>
exactly 3 times.  I put it away in disgust all three times.<br/>

I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>
is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>
would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>
will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>
<br/>
An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>
to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>
than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>
song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>
make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>
mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>
