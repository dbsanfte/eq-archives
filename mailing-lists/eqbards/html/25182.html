<div id="ygrps-yiv-703058495">It probably matters little to those of high level, but as someone who<br/>
decided to try a new idea and roleplay a low level merchant/tradeskill<br/>
character on the new deity server I am really torqued off.  Because some<br/>
people exploited an mistake in the fish fillet/ fresh fish prices to make<br/>
exorbitant amounts of money on Sullon Verant in typical fashion has<br/>
responded childishly by choosing the worst possible solution.<br/>
<br/>
There I was happily fishing/baking my way to being able to slowly work up<br/>
some tradeskills when suddenly the patch comes down today.  Now the one way<br/>
to actually make some small amount of money without endlessly fighting and<br/>
camping and killing is gone.  A fisher can now no longer make even the small<br/>
amount of slow money they once could by fishing then baking their catch and<br/>
selling what they made.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been a simple change to just make merchants charge more for<br/>
the Fresh Fish they sell and eliminate the infinite profit syndrome that<br/>
caused the problem, but that would not allow them to strike back at those<br/>
who bested them.  Alas, those they hurt have nothing in common with those<br/>
who caused Verant the grief in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
The sole reason I posted this here is that you have all become friends of<br/>
some kind and I feel that the one experience that had started me turning<br/>
back to playing my bard and EQ in general after several months away has now<br/>
been killed.  I&#39;m not sure how much longer I will choose to give my money to<br/>
a company that cares more for its own importance than it does its customers<br/>
despite the promising aspects of its game.<br/>
