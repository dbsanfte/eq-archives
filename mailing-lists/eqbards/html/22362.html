&gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean if us American&#39;s can&#39;t figure out which darn holes to punch in a<br/>
&gt;ballot card (even a person with a doctorate was quoted as saying that it<br/>
&gt;was confusing) then how can we expect Verant to always get things right. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mmh no comments, apart from that the ballot card looked pretty confusing to me,<br/>
luckely Im Danish we still cast our votes with a ball pen and an X.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m just glad that it was detected and fixed before it went live. I&#39;d give<br/>
&gt;them more credit had they found and detected the bug themselves, but then<br/>
&gt;again, we never hear about those.<br/>
