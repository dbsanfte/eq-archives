<div id="ygrps-yiv-210620894">I have been told that a named gypsy NPC drops the battle drum.  Don&#39;t have<br/>
one myself but looking forward to it.  I have only been in Mistmoore 3-4<br/>
times but on two of those occasions someone was auctioning the battle drum<br/>
for 500PP.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, one time someone pulled a train of the gypsies to the zone.  There were<br/>
two regular gypsies and the named gypsy.  I had just zoned in.  There were<br/>
about 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.  People started<br/>
dropping like flies and one of the gypsies started attacking me.  I quickly<br/>
got pummeled hard so I zoned.  Soon, everyone who were fighting them and<br/>
didn&#39;t die zoned.  They were pretty beat up when they arrived in Lesser<br/>
Faydark.  That leads me to believe you need a group of 30+ players to<br/>
survive against the gypsies.<br/>
