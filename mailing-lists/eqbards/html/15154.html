<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947468765">Cool thought Gaelaian.  An you should be able to run away from anything in the<br/>
game, except one- Hasten Bootstrutter.  One hint to high level bards- don&#39;t use<br/>
your AOE non-party spells while running around trying to get named critters to<br/>
spawn unless you know he&#39;s not up.<br/>
<br/>
This guy outruns anything.  Could be because he had me to below 1/2 health when<br/>
I started running (in about 2 seconds).<br/>
<br/>
Was pretty funny- glad my friendly neighborhood cleric was there!<br/>
