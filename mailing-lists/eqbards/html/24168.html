<div id="ygrps-yiv-977710414">well, if they wanted to keep the same idea, they need to...<br/>
<br/>
1) Drastically reduce the mana cost or put the song on a recast timer that<br/>
is much shorter than 40 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
2) Drastically increase the damage.<br/>
<br/>
3) Scrap the song and start over. My dream song would be an AE stun that<br/>
used mana at a rate slightly faster than our charm song.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i think Adam is right, there is always something better to do than <br/>

better to do than DDD, then it is useless.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, what <br/>
changes would need to be made to make it worth memming in place of <br/>
some other song?<br/>
<br/>
Put it on a timer, rather than consuming mana?  10 minutes?<br/>
<br/>
Increase the damage?  What damage would be sufficient to make it <br/>
worth memming?<br/>
<br/>
Make it DD rather than AE? <br/>
<br/>
What would be the point of ever memming our 55 BBB (except maybe for <br/>
the stun effect) if DDD was made single target?  Other than having 2 <br/>
songs to cycle through, but who has 2 free song slots?<br/>
