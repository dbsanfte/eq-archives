&gt; &gt; It does not refute it at all.  Clarity pulse once every six seconds, our <br/>
&gt; &gt; songs have a 3 second casting time (time from when you start the song till <br/>
&gt; &gt; the first effect is felt). So weaving clarity with 1 song = little to no <br/>
&gt; &gt; loss of mana regen, as the clarity song will pulse every 6 to 7 seconds <br/>
&gt; &gt; depending on your manual dexterity, computer&#39;s framerate, and missed notes.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; You can even weave it with to songs and still get nearly the same effect <br/>
&gt; &gt; like this:  Song1 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song2 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song1 -&gt; Clarity, etc...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So start-stopping clarity to force it to pulse every 3 seconds doubles<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s effectiveness?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, the shortest duration a song can last seems to be 6<br/>
seconds.  When GZ says you get a &quot;dose&quot; of the song, it means<br/>
you get the song effect, and cannot get another dose of that<br/>
effect (from the same bard) for another 6 seconds.  If the<br/>
stop/start trick worked, it should in theory double the<br/>
effectiveness of Clarity.  I found it had no effect.  The only<br/>
other person I know who tested it found it helped by about<br/>
30%(?), but he had bad lag and PL (in which case stop/starting<br/>
it *would* help since it would reduce the chance of you<br/>
exceeding a 6 second window due to lag).<br/>
<br/>
I do wish someone else (without lag or PL :) would test this<br/>
though.  I&#39;m confident in the results I got, but it&#39;d be nice<br/>
to get someone else to verify the results.<br/>
