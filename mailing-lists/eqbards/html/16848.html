<div id="ygrps-yiv-434948179">Aye it&#39;s not as good as screech.  But test isn&#39;t as uhh... populated as the<br/>
live servers (or wasn&#39;t back then.  I haven&#39;t played over there since my<br/>
corpse got stuck in a wall and I lost all my stuff ;(  No GM&#39;s there so if<br/>
you lose your corpse you LOSE your corpse ;(.  This pre-dated the necro<br/>
&#39;fetch the corpse&#39; spell.  Not to mention, nobody would have been high<br/>
enough back then ;)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, using screech to taunt like that would have caused a massive<br/>
train (lower guk) and probably would have wound up wiping out one, if not<br/>
both, of the other 2 groups in the area.   I used to try very hard not to<br/>
train others when we got into a bad situation.  All of us did :)  So, sure,<br/>
Screach would have been better but it wouldn&#39;t have been polite.  In guk on<br/>
a live server at worst you&#39;re going to get a few folks a little<br/>
inconvenienced.  In Guk on test you could wipe out several people, causing a<br/>
hellish CR.  (I was 30ish at the time and there weren&#39;t many of us at all)<br/>

PS:<br/>
It worked, it didn&#39;t work super well, but it worked.  And it kept the group<br/>
alive.  Once or twice it actually made the situation manageable again...<br/>
though usually it got me killed while getting the party out.  Like I said,<br/>
it&#39;s not perfect, and there are better ways but there were situations where<br/>
it was a god-send.<br/>
<br/>
On a live server?  I wouldn&#39;t use it.  I don&#39;t remember the last time I was<br/>
in a situation where our group couldn&#39;t handle every mob that we could get<br/>
our hands on... IF we could get our hands on them.  On Test?  Dunno, I hear<br/>
its starting to get crowded there now too.  I should probably go visit again<br/>
and see how things are.<br/>

&gt; &quot;I used to use it a LOT on test to get things off the evac&#39;er&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve loaded Dirge a few times specifically as a taunt.  I&#39;ve found it<br/>
&gt; incredibly unreliable compared to just Screeching, since our Evac&#39;er has<br/>
&gt; often done far more damage or healing than Dirge by the time we realize we<br/>
&gt; need to Evac.  In the old days, even Lullaby would have been more reliable<br/>
&gt; (ie, back when the resist rate wasn&#39;t such crap, and it wiped the hate<br/>
&gt; list).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an example to the (unusually) low taunt of Dirge: we decided to blitz<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Sol B king room with full spawn, since we had an enchanter with us.  I<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; them I&#39;d lead with Dirge as we ran in, which I did.  You&#39;d expect that at<br/>
&gt; least one mob would have rushed me, but all 3 latched onto our warrior as<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; ran in (ie, he hadn&#39;t even taunted or hit anything yet.)<br/>
