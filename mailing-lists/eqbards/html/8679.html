&gt; &gt;Oh come on, you can take HG&#39;s. Be creative, I can do 2 HG&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt;within about 8 minutes, Im sure you could do better than that :)<br/>

I just got two HG&#39;s to duke it out yesterday as well (my first time).  Got<br/>
the EXP for both.  I am level 30 with 104 Charisma.  If I remember<br/>
correctly, they only resisted once or twice.  Needless to say, that was the<br/>
quickest 54pp I&#39;ve ever made.<br/>
<br/>
However...<br/>
<br/>
Feeling pretty macho, I went down to Rathe Mnts to do some serious Giant<br/>
killing.  For some reason, or another, the HG&#39;s there resist A LOT more than<br/>
the the HG&#39;s in West Commons.  I had one resist about 9 times in a row.<br/>
Very disconcerting.  In fact, I didn&#39;t even bother to finish the fight..</div>
