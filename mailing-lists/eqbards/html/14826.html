because so many mobs disease (I felt bad having to ask for a cure after<br/>
nearly every fight).  This for single mob pulls, and when I start getting<br/>
attention I stop attacking for a few rounds.  If more than one comes in,<br/>
songs go by the wayside.<br/>

My biggest peeve with the 50 song is that the message is exactly the same<br/>
as Chant of Battle.  I usually pick what to weave next from the last<br/>
message I see, and this makes it rather difficult.<br/>
