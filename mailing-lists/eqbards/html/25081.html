Reliability is up...a lot.<br/>
<br/>
On the overclockers forum I frequent, I can recall no posts lamenting DOA<br/>
processors offhand...and these are people who share every step they take<br/>
when OC&#39;ing their machines.  :)  The 2 biggest processor killers on the<br/>
forum are heat casualties and crushed cores from trying to install<br/>
heatsinks.  :)<br/>
<br/>
There is no real reason to not consider equally an AMD machine vs an Intel<br/>
machine, when shopping around.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I know before K7<br/>
AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about any problems<br/>
with k7 series though??<br/>
