<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196910672">Call me crazy (shouts from the crowd &#39;YOUR CRAZY&#39;) but<br/>
upon further inspection of my bronze, no where on it<br/>
does it have a size, much like blackened iron, which<br/>
can be slid off of a wood elf and on to, say, a troll.<br/>
 And besides, I didn&#39;t buy it for ac or weight, I<br/>
bought it for looks.  Not a lot of wood elves on my<br/>
server wearing it, and at least 4 times when I get on<br/>
some one asks me if it&#39;s crested :)</div>
