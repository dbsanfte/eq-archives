<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928151340"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You can solo as a bard fairly effective till about 21st or 22nd level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a matter of playing style, as well as character race and<br/>
strength.  I have been unable to solo without dying every five minutes since<br/>
level 12 or so.  Mainly because I am a wood elf and most of the things that<br/>
are blue to my character have a nasty habit of hitting hard and stunning<br/>
often, as well as gathering friends to help them.<br/>

&gt;their role.  Once you&#39;ve tasted it, you&#39;ll find it terrible to be w/o a<br/>
&gt;group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This I have to agree with.  There is nothing as satisfying to me as spending<br/>
a few hours fighting with my party at my side.  Regretfully, we know each<br/>
other and our personal responsibilities so well now that on the rare<br/>
occassions that we find someone else to join us it is difficult to integrate<br/>
them into our party.<br/>
