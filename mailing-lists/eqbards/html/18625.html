there are several large guilds that can handle large targets solo, and there<br/>
are many alliances of guilds that take on large targets in the rotation as<br/>
if they were one guild.<br/>
<br/>
granted, we&#39;re getting almost 10 guilds/alliances in the rotations, but it&#39;s<br/>
working great.<br/>

<br/>
    I know this isn&#39;t Bard Related -but no Kabong so far - so I have a<br/>
question - is it impossible to do a Dragon or Plane raid with members from<br/>
multiple guilds?  Granted the ability to use guild chat makes communication<br/>
easier (although once in the plane - isn&#39;t Shout the equivalent)?  People<br/>
use shout in Sol B all the time for Fire Giant Raids.<br/>
<br/>
    I can understand the concern for having people you trust to know how to<br/>
play their chars and not &quot;ninja-loot&quot;.  But unless I&#39;m missing something -<br/>
this concept is what causes people in smaller guilds to complain of<br/>
&quot;uber-guilds&quot; and &quot;Character Stealing&quot;.  Is it TRULY necessary to have a<br/>
single guild complete these events?<br/>
