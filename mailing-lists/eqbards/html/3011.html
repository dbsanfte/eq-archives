<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319572800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So if it really is time for a new ISP any suggestions out there?<br/>
&gt; Who is good, since mine is obviously far worse than I thought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would suggest AT&T Worldnet as a good choice. I used to use Earthlink, but<br/>
they go the whole way thru UUnet and with the troubles that UUnet seems to still<br/>
have occasionally I would suggest staying away from any ISP that leases their<br/>
bandwidth from UUnet.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T Worldnet goes thru a combination of AT&T&#39;s own lines and Cerfnet. If you<br/>
are on one of the servers that is on the Cerfnet backbone (as I am) this is a<br/>
great way to go. Ping times are in the 175 to 240 range and I almost always have<br/>
0 0 packet loss. And did you ever notice that when UUnet was having fits that<br/>
there were still a couple hundred people on the servers? THEY weren&#39;t going thru<br/>
UUnet. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you call the various ISP&#39;s in your area you might be able to give the the<br/>
address of your server and ask them to do a traceroute to see what backbone(s)<br/>
it goes thru. Dunno how receptive they&#39;d be buy you could try.<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble opinions,<br/>
