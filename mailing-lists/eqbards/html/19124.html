<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096771909">My guild has four bards over 40,  myself still plugging along at 36, and a<br/>
couple in their 20s.  Not certain if that is classified as an &quot;enormous&quot;<br/>
quantity but we do have more bards in the guild than any other class.  One<br/>
of the good things about having a lot of bards in your guild is that there<br/>
is a good chance there will always be at least two bards in your group.<br/>
Good example of what you can do with two bards occured last night in The<br/>
Overthere.  Me and another bard guildmate were partnered up and ripping thru<br/>
everything in the zone.  He would sing chains and fear non stop and I would<br/>
weave celerity, chant of battle and FCC.  If a mob got more than two or<br/>
three attacks on us the entire combat they got lucky.  Later on a rogue saw<br/>
us and asked what we were doing.  We explained the chains/fear trick to him.<br/>
He asked to join and all me and the other bard could see were visions of<br/>
massive backstabs in the immediate future.  After the rogue joined we were<br/>
shredding thru mobs like a cuisinart.  The only time we ever lost a visible<br/>
portion on our health bar was if a 2d or 3d mob aggroed on us.  At no time<br/>
did we ever get into serious trouble.  All in all it was non-stop killing<br/>
with almost zero downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is after he had been with us for a while, the rogue mentioned<br/>
that he had never seen any bard fighting in the style we had.  The rogue had<br/>
a 50+ primary character so he had been playing EQ for a while.  I had though<br/>
the chains/fear trick was a bard standard, especially in Kunark with the<br/>
small aggro radius of most mobs.  Does everyone else use this trick whenever<br/>
the situation supports it (i.e. outdoors) or is it a largely non-used trick?<br/>

I&#39;m in Armigers of Mirth.  There is usually a group of Armigers hanging out<br/>
at the windmill, the Hounted Tower, or the Sarnak castle most nights.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been in Frontier Mountains lately hacking away at big giants. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Galtin&#39;s guild Disciples of Honor has an enormous number<br/>
of bards in it.  I think we have only three, me at 29 still, Rylos at 25,<br/>
and a very young bard<br/>
whose name escapes me right now.  We are working on organizing an alliance<br/>
with DoH to do those tougher things later on like Dragons etc.<br/>
