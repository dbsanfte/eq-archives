<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652790467">the worst orders are the ones where you ask 20 times &quot;are you SURE you want<br/>
a gorget? a spiked collar would probably be a lot better and cost as much&quot;<br/>
they reply &quot;sure sure, full suit&quot;<br/>
<br/>
then an hour later running back and forth from misty thicket to HH because<br/>
you&#39;re making small and you run to EC and finally show up after a bunch of<br/>
impatient tells and he says &quot;Oh!  i just need a tunic, legs and cloak now.<br/>
how much for those 3?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
hehe ulcers coming back to me from this.  i charge 1000pp to make a full<br/>
suit of banded now.  very effectively tells people i&#39;ve hung up my<br/>
sledgehammer.<br/>
<br/>
but there is something to be said for being able to create actual armor<br/>
(that isn&#39;t half bad) from your own hands.<br/>

As a Master Smith on the Karana server it is just not worth my time or<br/>
effort to make and sell Banded anymore.  As most people are not willing to<br/>
pay enough to make it worth while.  That combined with too many flakey<br/>
customers, last 2 people who wanted a complete set flaked on me after I had<br/>
made it, have led me to stop making banded for sale.  The only time I make<br/>
it now is for friends that need it.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know about banded being unprofitable...Shamans<br/>
&gt; need it for totemic armor and there are usually a few<br/>
&gt; people making it, I think it&#39;s rare because the skill<br/>
&gt; required to make the stuff takes a long time to build.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got most of my bronze (just upgraded) from a 43rd<br/>
&gt; lvl magician camping Einhorst in the Barb village in<br/>
&gt; WK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But up until this week I had a full set of banded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WK might be a good place to buy bronze cheap since<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s so heavy and Einhorst apparently drops quite a<br/>
&gt; bit of it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Banded armour (and what level should we upgrade to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dragoon Dirk: 40P<br/>
&gt; &gt; Banded Armor is usually less than 1P per AC.  Bronze<br/>
&gt; &gt; is normally 1+ a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit per AC.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you can carry it, skip banded and go right to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze.  Its cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough now, and no one makes banded anymore (since<br/>
&gt; &gt; its so unprofitable)<br/>
