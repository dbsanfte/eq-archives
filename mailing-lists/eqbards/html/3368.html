&gt;I have the drum as well. Here&#39;s hard facts on the Mistmoore Battle Drum - same<br/>
&gt;weight (0.5) as a hand drum, but definitely gives some increase in speed <br/>
&gt;over the<br/>
&gt;handdrum when using selo&#39;s, and a documentable feature would be when using <br/>
&gt;either<br/>
&gt;Guardian or Elemental Rhythms it boosts resist by 5 points MORE than a <br/>
&gt;handdrum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What exactly is this noticable effect you refer to with the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>
&gt;Princess? There is no difference at all with Hymn of Restoration, nor with any<br/>
&gt;other song as far as I can tell. I am Level 27. Feel free to quntify your<br/>
&gt;statement with something more useful then &quot;it does extra stuff&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well i was almost positive that it gave me an xtra 4hps per tick with hymn,<br/>
however another bard of the same lvl tried it out and said it didnt. So i<br/>
might have been getting confused with the natural healing rate, its a<br/>
little tricky to judge sometimes with the server actually *dropping* your<br/>
hps below what the client software thinks it is. So when the servers come<br/>
back up i plan on doing some testing. I hope im right, but its starting to<br/>
look like i am wrong. :(<br/>
<br/>
PS check out the psalms if you havent, i havent seen any source mention<br/>
this but they give damage shields too. At least the psalm of warmth does, i<br/>
need to go pick up the rest of the psalms now :)<br/>
