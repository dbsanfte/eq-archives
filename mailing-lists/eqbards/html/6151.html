<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053882067">You don&#39;t make not of the fact that you&#39;re doing damage to every mob at once<br/>
with the songs.  Dual Ykeshas is obviously very strong, but you&#39;re only<br/>
damaging one mob at a time with them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class is that as you<br/>
&gt; &gt; mature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over time, start to do<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.  So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; &gt; research into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game<br/>
as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; wife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you<br/>
develop<br/>
&gt; &gt; your skills more fully.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Where is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My<br/>
guess<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; instruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>
&gt; &gt; crossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>
&gt; will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>
&gt; upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>
&gt; L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>
&gt; see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>
&gt; party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>
&gt; which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>
&gt; damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes when I&#39;m in a bad mood I think that if it wasn&#39;t for the mana<br/>
&gt; song, Bards would be lower on the list for getting in a group than a<br/>
&gt; rogue in most people&#39;s eyes. (assuming both characters are played well<br/>
&gt; by people who are fun to have in your group)<br/>
