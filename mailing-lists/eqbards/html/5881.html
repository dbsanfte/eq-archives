&gt; &gt;Addendum. If you drop a container with a nodrop item in it the entire<br/>

&gt; &gt;I highly recommend people keep their weapons in regular inventory slots,<br/>
&gt; &gt;which can be hotkeyed. Then keep your instruments in a bag which can be<br/>
&gt; &gt;on another hotkeyed inventory slot. This makes swapping a lot easier.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Only problem might be the Battle Drum. Is it lore? I haven&#39;t played in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;couple of weeks now so I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I play in fullscreen mode, thus I cannot &quot;open&quot; containers in hotkey&#39;d<br/>
&gt; inventory slots. I keep my most important instruments in general slots, and<br/>
&gt; just deal without for the rest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do this in fullscreen mode, but you have to be in 640x480. One<br/>
of several reasons why I still play in 640x480 mode dispite my<br/>
computer&#39;s ability to handle higher resolutions. <br/>
