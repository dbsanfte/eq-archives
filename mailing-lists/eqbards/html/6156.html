&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if there is a helm comparable Banded that looks<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; &gt;on Humans, and where might I get one?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looks are soo important.  I was wearing Banded, Loved the look, hated the<br/>
&gt; helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>
&gt; looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>
&gt; Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>
&gt; buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>
&gt; like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>
&gt; went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>
&gt; Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>
&gt; helms, too :P<br/>
