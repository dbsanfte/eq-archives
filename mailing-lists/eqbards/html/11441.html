<div id="ygrps-yiv-235689492">You got to be kidding me?  Brad leaves out the Charm nerf for levels over 35<br/>
and the nerfing of Accelerando, which GZ himself admitted was a nerf, not a<br/>
bug fix, and you think Brad&#39;s on target?  How about the reduction to our<br/>
DoT&#39;s? another minus.  That&#39;s three big minuses in like 30 seconds, and Brad<br/>
got other developers input on his list?  What were they working on,<br/>
sovereign?<br/>

For the most part on target in my opinion if a bit too pointed.  You are<br/>
mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>
gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>
about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>
songs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic<br/>
instrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the<br/>
instrument.<br/>
