My take on whether I will wear plate is based on the look and the weight vs <br/>
the AC gained. I put alot of points into STR and STM and have boost items <br/>
for both currently. As a wood elf dual wielding barbed whips, I am stam <br/>
starved in a long fight (love Jig), even with a blackened girdle +5 stam. I <br/>
have mostly banded or magical pieces of armor and weight wise, I&#39;m pretty <br/>
heavy. I will likely hold out for some ruby just due to weight. I really <br/>
hate the art for wood elf plate helms, and being a woman, it really does <br/>
matter how I look, so its off the list. I will probably go for boots and <br/>
gloves first in plate. The rest willmean giving up barbed and Bloodstained <br/>
and will take alot of thought. As far as RP&#39;ing a bard, I try to take the <br/>
outgoing, knowledgeable, well traveled tack, not the minstrel fop tack. Also <br/>
my guild is mainly barbarians so we never lack for full tanks, so I can be a <br/>
healer or tank as I choose.<br/>
Next is a question, we were in lake Rathe last night and found a big hole <br/>
under the island (underwater) that has 3 aviak guards on a tower. My guild <br/>
mates did not know what this went to. I just got L17 back after being reset <br/>
a week, and was not keen on losing it. Any idea what lives in there? Is it a <br/>
zone?<br/>
I also think we have a good list here. No real flames just lots of different <br/>
opinions. Great discussions. :)<br/>
