<b>Subject:</b> Re: UnBroken Song--Selo&#39;s and root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220713969">Actually, I was dueling a wizard friend of mine--he<br/>
was 30 and I was 26 level.  I broke root with selo&#39;s<br/>
everytime on a pulse.  I even wouldn&#39;t run it<br/>
constantly and I could start it up and break the root<br/>
on the first pulse.  Haven&#39;t checked on mobs. <br/>
Usually, the ones that root me lately can kill me in 3<br/>
casts anyway, so I don&#39;t really have a good way to<br/>
test.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I<br/>
&gt; tested some more to see<br/>
&gt; what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted<br/>
&gt; and Accelerando is not<br/>
&gt; up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running<br/>
&gt; when you get Rooted<br/>
&gt; however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot;<br/>
&gt; pulse message will break you<br/>
&gt; free.  This happened every time I tried it, both<br/>
&gt; with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>
&gt; The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new<br/>
&gt; zone caused the Root<br/>
&gt; icon to again take hold.  <br/>
&gt; For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you<br/>
&gt; get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>
&gt; the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording<br/>
&gt; despite my actual real<br/>
&gt; testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando<br/>
&gt; goes down though you will<br/>
&gt; not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that<br/>
&gt; Root icon still on your<br/>
&gt; screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>
