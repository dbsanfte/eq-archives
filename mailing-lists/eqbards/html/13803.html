&gt; I played a bit at lunch.  Now that we have a the<br/>
&gt; secondary resist message on Lullaby, it is<br/>
&gt; disturbingly easy to see just how incredibly<br/>
&gt; poorly lullaby works.  I was fighting groups of<br/>
&gt; faeries in lfay (that are barely blue to me) and<br/>
&gt; getting less than 50% success rate at lullabying<br/>
&gt; them.  This is with singing the song continuously<br/>
&gt; like GZ said we should.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my hope - that once it becomes obvious how poorly the<br/>
song works (whereas before people could just say it was our<br/>
imagination), enough people will complain that they&#39;ll unnerf<br/>
it.  Send /feedback saying that the new resist message should<br/>
be red, not blue.  That will make it even more obvious.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I&#39;m going to try getting my charisma up around 200<br/>
(still need a couple more items) and see what the resist rate<br/>
on level 1 mobs is like.<br/>
