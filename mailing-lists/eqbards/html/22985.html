<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why Did You Start a Bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-217147112">I recall that everytime they tinker with snare/root, Selos breaks. You&#39;d<br/>
think someone somewhere would have a Sticky note: check bard speed when<br/>
changing root/snare!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I play a bard because there&#39;s always something to do. I actually don&#39;t<br/>
get insulted when asked for mana song, just bored! So I had that to sing<br/>
during downtimes and maybe during a fight if mana was running short, but I<br/>
had melee to do and that&#39;s always fun. Then the new song Catana comes along<br/>
and my cleric makes me sing that and clarity. So suddenly I&#39;m instrument<br/>
bard! We compromise on a macro for Battle that has Catana and some other<br/>
songs to benefit the meleer&#39;s but I&#39;m playing a lute during the whole fight<br/>
now. I find it a bit duller than melee&#39;ing but the cleric swears he heals<br/>
less and the group can more faster overall this way. Now I get a haste sash,<br/>
(the ranger in the group had a haste item and wasn&#39;t concerned about the one<br/>
that dropped, I got it by default!). The cleric is the one who points out I<br/>
have no haste item, I wasn&#39;t concerned since he&#39;d converted me to instrument<br/>
bard. (Maybe he just wanted his TBB back, hehe.) Anyway, now I&#39;m back to<br/>
melee bard as we seem to be tank poor again and clarity comes mainly during<br/>
downtimes. I will be back on the lute whenever we have tank support, I&#39;m<br/>
sure. To me, it&#39;s  a case of listening to Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star when<br/>
you&#39;d prefer Metallica.<br/>
