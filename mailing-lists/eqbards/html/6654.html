<div id="ygrps-yiv-791410956"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I propose that we on this list work together on creating a guide that<br/>
&gt; educates all non-bards on the Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s when grouping with a bard.<br/>
&gt; Let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Geeze ! Tom scores again ! In 2 hours I am running &quot;The First Bardic<br/>
Boot Camp&quot; on Caz-Thule for the Guild I just joined, House of Rising<br/>
Phoenix. In addition to training all Bards I made up a &quot;Guide BooK&quot; that<br/>
includes this kind of information. I also sent an outline to the Guild<br/>
members of a general &quot;Guide Book&quot; for all classes that we could give to<br/>
Members and new &quot;hires&quot;. I am sure that every class will want impute and<br/>
it will be a valuable reference. I have &quot;pasted&quot; the outline I emailed<br/>
to the membership yesterday for their comment.<br/>
 Feel free to copy it if you wish. <br/>
