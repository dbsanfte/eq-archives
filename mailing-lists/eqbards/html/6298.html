<div id="ygrps-yiv-479341506">aye i went and trained it when i first heard about it, and put some practice<br/>
points in it, but no matter how many times i used the skill, i never saw an<br/>
increase and it never scared anyone hehe.  and yes the fear song is so much<br/>
better, and even though it is AE, it&#39;s range is not too dangerous.<br/>

&gt; about our level<br/>
&gt; 26 skill, Instill Doubt. I have never heard this one <br/>
&gt; discussed at all, most<br/>
&gt; likely because our level 26 fear song is much better in <br/>
&gt; accomplishing the<br/>
&gt; job, but is there anyone out there who can share some <br/>
&gt; experiences with this<br/>
&gt; one? </span></blockquote></div>
