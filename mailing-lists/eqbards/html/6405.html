NK.  You will zone into WK on a route while takes you over<br/>
some really high hills (mountains really).  Weave Accelerando<br/>
and levitate while running.  The mountains get you high enough<br/>
up that you literally feel like you&#39;re flying an airplane over<br/>
West Karana.  It was high enough up that I didn&#39;t want to risk<br/>
letting levitate stop to see how much damage I took.  It works<br/>
in EK too if you get a lift from the cliffs near the Highpass<br/>
ramp, but the zone is much smaller.<br/>

inventory mode while running with the mouse.  If I want to<br/>
check one of my stats while running, I have to switch to<br/>
auto-run, switch to inventory mode, switch out, then stop<br/>
auto-run.  This was so much easier when I could just hit &#39;i&#39;<br/>
while running.<br/>
