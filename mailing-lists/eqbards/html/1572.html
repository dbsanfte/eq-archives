<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583765953">It&#39;s in highhold city itself, which is another zone. I assume you&#39;ve been <br/>
around and around if you&#39;ve been searching so no need to tell you where the <br/>
gates are. So... go into the city zone, beyond the square and it&#39;s then <br/>
take a door to your left, and go into the room beyond. Mister Justin Rhymes <br/>
hangs out there with some enchanter fellow.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, just for people&#39;s info... NPC necros really seem to hate anyone <br/>
playing Guardian Rhythms. Got totally hosed by the unkempt (or whatever) <br/>
crowd out beyond Kerra Ridge in Erudin, they ignored everyone else and <br/>
DOT&#39;d me to hell. No chance of resisting all 50 or so spells aimed at me.<br/>

It&#39;s a harsh harsh life.<br/>
