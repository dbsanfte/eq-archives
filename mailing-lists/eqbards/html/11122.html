<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054945676"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The named cyclops in the Ocean of Tears (Queg?) is not quite<br/>
&gt; as bad, and he took 6 of us at L40-46 a good 5 minutes to<br/>
&gt; kill.  Not surprisingly, we got 2gp as loot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Queq Maelstrom isn&#39;t so bad so long as you don&#39;t let him melee your<br/>
party casters. He does attempt to ManaDrain quite a bit. when we did<br/>
seafury cyclops I pulled for a party of casters. The cleric didn&#39;t do<br/>
much more than stun, there was really no need to heal. The wizard and<br/>
necro DoT&#39;d/nuked while I tied it up in melee. It&#39;s a nice exp place<br/>
since a bard can team up nicely with a good wizard and double up on the<br/>
abundant supply of seafuries. <br/>
