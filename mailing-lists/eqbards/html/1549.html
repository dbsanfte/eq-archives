&gt;For real fun, find Innothule Swamp in the SW corner, hang a left and<br/>
&gt;follow the coast, and enter upper Guk.  Kill a lot of frogloks, and<br/>
&gt;you should come out with a nice collection of woven armor.  (I&#39;ve been in <br/>
&gt;Guk for hours and found not a thing, then found 3 woven gloves in a row.)  <br/>
&gt;Take the woven to Qeynos where there are lots of<br/>
&gt;monks and higher demand for the stuff.  Sell any gloves you find for<br/>
&gt;as much as you can, O&#39; 8pp or more.  I made 60 pp with a few packfulls from <br/>
&gt;Guk to Qeynos, and that was with people telling me<br/>
&gt;my prices were more than fair.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i have to disagree about killing in guk right now, because you will be hated <br/>
at higher levels when you wish to return to lower guk, when you really hope <br/>
to go to guk.  blackburrow, paw, and misty thicket are all the places id <br/>
suggest to go to get exp and money.<br/>
