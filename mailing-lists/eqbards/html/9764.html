<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777647984">This is something that I mentioned in an earlier message today and that<br/>
Kitasi later added on to.  Kitasi&#39;s theory, which I believe is correct, is<br/>
that Lament only reduces the agro range of a mob.  For example, you have<br/>
three mobs standing near another.  In order, you Lament the first two and<br/>
then attack the third one.  Once you attack the third one, you turn around<br/>
and run back to where your group is at with the third one chasing you.  If<br/>
the third mob gets close enough to the first two mobs (i.e. within their<br/>
reduced agro range), he will activate them and now you have three on your<br/>
tail.  The way to get around that is to Lament all three and then go back to<br/>
the first one and attack it.  If you do it that way, you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about it activating the other two.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to test Kitasi&#39;s theory is to Lament a single mob.  Once you<br/>
Lament him, get right up in its face.  If Lament only reduces the agro<br/>
range, then this should set him off.  Will test it when I get the chance.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Has anyone else had this song (Lament) behave weirdly on them?  There have<br/>
&gt; been a handful of occasions where I get the message (&quot;XXXX looks sad&quot;),<br/>
&gt; attempt to pull another nearby MOB, and then both of them come running<br/>
&gt; (even<br/>
&gt; the lamented one).  Just recently, I was trying to pull some elites out of<br/>
&gt; the king room.  I lulled the patriarch (got the &quot;sad&quot; message) and then<br/>
&gt; everything started coming at me (including the patriarch).  Like I said,<br/>
&gt; this has only happened maybe 2 or 3 times in my whole career.  A druid<br/>
&gt; friend of mine also stated that she occasionally has the same thing happen<br/>
&gt; with Harmony.  It&#39;s somewhat similar to how Pixie Strike or Apalling<br/>
&gt; Screech<br/>
&gt; apparently do nothing, even though you get the message.<br/>
