 </span></blockquote>  Gimme a break, it&#39;s not that useful.  That&#39;s what your L26 song does.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a different way of doing it ;)  And it&#39;s fun ;)  Besides.  What else<br/>
are we going to use it for :)<br/>
<br/>
  Dirge = cute and useless, nuff said, thx.<br/>
<br/>
Sure it&#39;s useless but you can use it ;)<br/>
<br/>
  You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>
  Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>
  Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>
  a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>
<br/>
Oh give me a break Harm.  You disagree with me, that&#39;s all.  I wasn&#39;t being<br/>
all knowing.  I was merely posting my opinion on the topic.  Last time I<br/>
checked I lived in a free country.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a<br/>
  word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like<br/>
  you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the equivalent<br/>
  of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>
  escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>
  come from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jhenders@...">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>
  proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>
  voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>
  the composure they do.<br/>
<br/>
Proper Nettiquette:  Using allcaps in a sentence is Shouting.  Using allcaps<br/>
on 1 word is used to emphasize that word.  It&#39;s been that way on the<br/>
internet since before there was HTML or email clients capable of RTF format.<br/>
Therefore, since those of us who were around back then learned to talk<br/>
without bold, italics, underline etc, we used allcaps (on 1 word in a<br/>
sentence) to emphasize the importance of that word.  It&#39;s not shouting.<br/>
<br/>
  Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>
  through a program that to_lowers everything   /sigh  =(<br/>
<br/>
Oh give me a break.  1 word and you are getting upset over an issue.  The<br/>
reason you&#39;re upset, frankly, is that someone disagreed with you and has<br/>
actually found a use for the song.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the only way to use<br/>
the song.  Nor am I saying its the best option.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I don&#39;t have to prove everyone wrong.  Just those who post their<br/>
opinions as if they were the only one possible.</div>
