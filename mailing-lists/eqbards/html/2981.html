<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-971432806">I&#39;m a fairly young Bard, and &quot;discovered&quot; twisting on my own<br/>
just fooling around with my early spells.  It&#39;s useful, but as<br/>
one of the &quot;dextrously challenged&quot; I&#39;m also a bit disappointed<br/>
since it seems to violate the EQ designer&#39;s statement that &quot;This<br/>
isn&#39;t a twitch game&quot;.  Esp, if what I&#39;m hearing about twisting<br/>
being both needed at higher levels, and impacted by connect speed,<br/>
graphics, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Would there be any support for trying to get a game mechanic to <br/>
actually sing two songs at once w/o building up your &quot;Twitch <br/>
reflexes&quot;.  Perhaps have it based on DEX and level?  I do really like<br/>
my Bard so far, but if what I&#39;m reading is true .. I&#39;ll be an L20 <br/>
class drop out.<br/>
<br/>
I do software dev. for a living, and already have had to go to a track<br/>
ball to dodge carpal tunnel as I age (and play more computer games for<br/>
leisure). :)<br/>

BTW. My data point.<br/>
<br/>
-Pentium II 350 MHz<br/>
-224 MB 100 MHz SDRAM (I dual boot and need this<br/>
when running NT and doing development work)<br/>
-Diamond Permedia 2, 8MB AGP<br/>
-56K USRobotics Modem usually get 33.3 off my ISP<br/>
-Win98, Registry regularly cleaned up, disks<br/>
 defrag&#39;ed etc ... <br/>
<br/>
I usually run in 1024x768 no trouble.  <br/>
Main problem is in-game lag in crowded zones, and<br/>
a DNS lag issue with my ISP.<br/>
If I do suddenly run into a zone with trouble, I usually<br/>
F10 back to the small view window, rather than the transparent<br/>
overhead view.  Its faster than changing the res.  <br/>
<br/>
With my Bard to do twisting I NEED to be in the F10 view<br/>
with the small window at 1024x768 or the graphics refresh on the <br/>
spell buttons is too slow.  I can twist 2 easily, should be able to do<br/>
3 when my songs have more staying power.<br/>
<br/>
My graphics card is no longer that amazing, but with the expected life<br/>
time of this system at about 1 year, I can&#39;t see replacing it now. But<br/>
if it becomes the kid&#39;s game system (as its predecessor did) when I have<br/>
to upgrade, maybe its not such a bad idea.<br/>

&gt;I can easily twist 3 songs, and often 4 (Anthem + Bellow x 3)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not 24th yet, so no extra sparklies... maybe framerate will tank<br/>
&gt;then? </span></blockquote></div>
