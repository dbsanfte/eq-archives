<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359734432">I really wish Elyana still subscribed to this list.<br/>
She was doing both dragons, weekly, at lvl 42 - and<br/>
they never failed. I&#39;m not disagreeing, or arguing,<br/>
and I can&#39;t say anything (I&#39;m too young, myself), but<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear what people that have done it did,<br/>
and what they have to say about it. I only know<br/>
(personally) 2 bards that have done dragons, and won.<br/>

  It&#39;s not worth your time to twist those songs. <br/>
Here&#39;s why from<br/>
  my limited experience in both planes, and inside<br/>
info from<br/>
  other servers dragon raids:<br/>
<br/>
  1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>
     With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with<br/>
all options<br/>
     off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your<br/>
misses,<br/>
     your hits, all spell, all song, I still got<br/>
lagged something<br/>
     horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to<br/>
update 30 people<br/>
     in a very tight area, nothing you can do about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
  2) You will get more attention than you wanted,<br/>
starting and stopping<br/>
     a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so<br/>
as it tripled me<br/>
     for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted<br/>
and he clobbered<br/>
     me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta<br/>
twist, so twist<br/>
     the right stuff ;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;buncha stuff snipped&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power<br/>
(L50) again.<br/>

  Harm.<br/>
