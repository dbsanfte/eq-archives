&gt;If Mayong is in the zone but not reachable by normal methods due to pathing<br/>
&gt;problems, is it possible that a solo bard who continues to use the 21st level<br/>
&gt;teleport song could eventually teleport to the area where Mayong is at?<br/>

you could normally walk to (thus preventing it&#39;s usefullness in<br/>
&quot;de-trapping&quot; oneself from such lovely areas as that stupid door in one of <br/>
the dungeons and that locked house in Kithicor.  I suspect this will <br/>
prevent it from being used in this manner.  Sad, too.<br/>
