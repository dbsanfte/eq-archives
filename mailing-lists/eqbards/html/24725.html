<div id="ygrps-yiv-324339401">Someone had showed an analysis regarding bard mana regen. They showed the <br/>
differences between just standing around, medding, medding while singing <br/>
clarity song, and medding while singing clarity song and having clarity <br/>
buff. Surprisingly, it showed that we do indeed recover mana faster with <br/>
things that enhance mana regen.<br/>
<br/>
If someone knows where this research is, I&#39;d love to see it again myself.<br/>

&gt;I am not trying to cause problems, but what do you have in your<br/>
&gt;flute? *Smiles* As far as I know, this will do you no good unless<br/>
&gt;your &quot;between fights&quot; is 40 minutes. *Grins*<br/>

&gt;Did I miss something with Bard, Mana, and medding?<br/>
