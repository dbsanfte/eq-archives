&gt; I don&#39;t know where the hell you were in Beta but the song is exactly the<br/>
&gt; same. I did the same combo at lower levels. Hell at 15th level I was soloing<br/>
&gt; 3 Fire Elementals at a time in Lava with that song. If you try it make sure<br/>
&gt; you are wearing decent armor (chain or better).<br/>

experiment in beta with different results.  Who cares really, I&#39;m just<br/>
reporting how it works now, for sure, because some people, most<br/>
importantly (to me) me, have been saying otherwise.<br/>
