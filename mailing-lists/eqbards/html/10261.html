aye i do understand how some skills do not require a point but will take<br/>
long to build, but others MUST have 1 point put into them to have you learn<br/>
the basics, otherwise they will never raise no matter how much button<br/>
mashing hehe.  some skills when you reach the level and put 1 point in them,<br/>
it will say &quot;You have increased your skill in...&quot; but different ones will<br/>
say &quot;You have learned the basics of...&quot;  with the first, you don&#39;t need the<br/>
1 point, but with the second you do.  i thought that our duel wield needed<br/>
one, but i am not positive.<br/>

&gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point <br/>
&gt; into the skill.<br/>
&gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through <br/>
&gt; actually using<br/>
&gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>
&gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>
&gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in <br/>
&gt; my youth back<br/>
&gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from <br/>
&gt; Butcherblock and<br/>
&gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>

&gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought <br/>
&gt; we had to put 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be <br/>
&gt; wrong though<br/>
&gt; &gt; hehe. </span></blockquote></div>
