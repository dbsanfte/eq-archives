&gt; &gt; I also don&#39;t think that the current player models will be any different<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; better than what they are now, unless you count new armor (which would <br/>
&gt; &gt; really only be a new skin, not a new model).  If you remember Velious<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; even Kunark have NPC&#39;s that are much more detailed than old world<br/>
&gt; Norrath...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, some of the interviews have specifically mentioned that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; re-doing the pcs to take advantage of the graphics upgrade...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;JB: I personally can&#39;t wait to see all the new player-character models<br/>
&gt; and textures and the attachable armor that they will be able to wear.<br/>
&gt; Visually, Luclin should raise the bar higher than either of the first two<br/>
&gt; expansions did&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

may not get invited to EXP groups alot as my Gnome wizard, but I think they<br/>
look cute and I still like my wizard for fun value reguardless.  They make me<br/>
look like that, they better give me some illusions.<br/>
