<div id="ygrps-yiv-668225960">Actually, from what I have seen, this only truly works for seven people. <br/>
You can do eight, but the eighth person no longer gets exp (I have heard<br/>
they used to, a few patches ago).  In addition, your cleric cannot see<br/>
person number 7, or if they are person number seven, they cannot see the<br/>
rest of the group.  Bard songs do hit the seventh person, though.  It<br/>
used to be that the seventh person got solo exp for the kill--too bad<br/>
they fixed that one :)<br/>
<br/>
A great use for this is for porting for raids--one wizzy, seven-grouping,<br/>
and /qing managed to get all of us up to Hate last night in three groups<br/>
instead of four, saving some money and time on the way.<br/>
<br/>
(OT) Being on my first ever raid I was a little surprised.  Is there<br/>
usually a one piece of cleric armor dropped for each of the non-cleric<br/>
ones?  We had four or five pieces, and three of those eight hours we did<br/>
not kill a single cleric--as opposed to one shammy, one warrior, one<br/>
pally, and one bard (last kill of the night gave me gloves, woohoo!).  We<br/>
probably ended up killing more spite golems than clerics.  We actually<br/>
had a set of cleric arms rot because all three clerics had them *and* a<br/>
backup pair, and did not want a third. Sorry for wandering so far<br/>
off-topic, I am just still psyched about how well the raid went, forgive<br/>
me ;)<br/>
