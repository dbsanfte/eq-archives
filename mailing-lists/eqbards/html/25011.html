your success with &quot;twisting&quot; songs.<br/>
1) How many songs can you twist at once - assuming constant effect songs.<br/>
2) What do you do to optimize your twisting?<br/>
3) What is your current playlist?  What do you sing in battle, and what out <br/>
of it?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few questions from a young-again bard<br/>
