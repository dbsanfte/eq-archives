<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-444138398">If I want to remove someone from my friend list I just type /friend soandso<br/>
and it removes them, just type the name of the person you want to remove<br/>
after the /friend<br/>
Works for me, might be a bit tedious but it saves deleting files etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

Ps, I am currently re-doing my Lambent armor quests for a friend who is<br/>
exchanging a Ykesha for a full suit of Lambent, seeing as I had alot of the<br/>
components before agreeing to this I thought it was a great idea. I<br/>
actually get to work for my Ykesha by doing some hard work. I have now got<br/>
everything except the Gypsy Lute and Black Silk Gloves. Guess where I&#39;m<br/>
heading tonight  =P<br/>

Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start over?  I typed<br/>
in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t seen in a long<br/>
time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed in addition to<br/>
players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, or /groupsay<br/>
but<br/>
instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the phrase I typed<br/>
to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire list, there<br/>
are<br/>
a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made numerous attempts<br/>
at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces before I type<br/>
in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my friend list.<br/>
<br/>
I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ directory this<br/>
will<br/>
delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
