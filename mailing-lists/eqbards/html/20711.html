<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510001701">I&#39;ve got one guildmate who, in an effort to RP more, say&#39;s Hi in guildchat,<br/>
then turns it off.  She&#39;s also got RP flag set.  So, basically, if I miss<br/>
her Hi, and do a /who all on the guild, I&#39;ll never even know she&#39;s around to<br/>
hook up with.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I take a different approach.  I look at guildchat and /who as being possible<br/>
because of gnomish inventions called Communicators and Tricorders.  ;^)  I<br/>
also have no issues personally with conversing with evil races.  My two<br/>
guilded characters, bard and rogue, feel associating with the dregs of<br/>
society is a necessary part of their profession.<br/>
<br/>
I have not yet found an IC way around discussing strategies though.  That<br/>
information NEEDs to be clear & concise.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well I&#39;d love to have you on Tunare, but the guild I&#39;m in <br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t RP enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Still if you do move to Tunare, give me a tell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have pondered what I see as an anti-RP pressure in EQ a <br/>
&gt; lot. I think it is<br/>
&gt; because the game itself requires so much logistics <br/>
&gt; discussion. Logistics can<br/>
&gt; be diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data much less <br/>
&gt; gussying it<br/>
&gt; up, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends to sound <br/>
&gt; pretty OOC.<br/>
&gt; Guildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there is no <br/>
&gt; premise at all of<br/>
&gt; sharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location. How do <br/>
&gt; you RP for more<br/>
&gt; than a short span when one person is in the Field of bone as <br/>
&gt; an Iksar and<br/>
&gt; another in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the High Elf <br/>
&gt; wants the Iksar<br/>
&gt; player to quit playing a secondary and come help... Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; possible to counter the effect, just that it is hard work.<br/>
