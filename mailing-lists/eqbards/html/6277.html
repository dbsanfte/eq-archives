 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  The problem now is actually finding two like-level mobs<br/>
to play charm tricks with, and managing to keep them far<br/>
enough from other people so that they don&#39;t decide to attack<br/>
because they can&#39;t find anything else to fight.  (For some<br/>
reason most people don&#39;t seem to understand that if two mobs<br/>
are fighting each other, then someone is causing it.  They<br/>
don&#39;t see a player fighting them so they think the mobs are<br/>
free.)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem yet on the younger shards (I<br/>
saw lots of giants last night on Tunare), but it&#39;s painfully<br/>
evident on the older ones.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen two giants<br/>
at once (except ice giants) in the entire last month on<br/>
Karana.  And when we did try fighting ice giants, the kill<br/>
stealers descended like flies to sh!t within a half hour.<br/>
