&gt; have no Enchanter)...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As an addendum, we know that Lullaby only works if all of the MOBs remain unattacked other than the one we are<br/>
focusing on (all of your group members are /assisting the puller, right?)  This means that if ANYone else in<br/>
the party is:  a) hitting the wrong MOB, b) casting AE spells, or c) has a weapon with an AE proc, Lullaby<br/>
will appear to not work.  To use this song effectively, you have to make certain that nobody else is doing<br/>
anything with Area Effects!  I really got hammered the other night when one of my party members had a weapon<br/>
that proc&#39;ed AE damage.  I had no clue what was going on until he asked if he should switch off....<br/>
