<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259018583">Now those are great ideas.  That would make it a scary place even if you<br/>
were fairly sure your group could handle some mobs.  Knowing anyone in your<br/>
group might run away screaming at any random moment, even while medd&#39;ing<br/>
would be downright fearsome!<br/>

Just an idea, but perhaps Verant could reduce the toughness of the combats<br/>
in the Planes so people have a better chance of survival but also make the<br/>
Planes somehow reflect what they are.  For example, in Fear, the players<br/>
magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become scared.<br/>
Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>
they start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a player<br/>
can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and start<br/>
attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are hit by<br/>
constant heat that affects health and/or stamina.  In Air, constant gales<br/>
that cause damage.  I came up with these on the fly so I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
other things that could be done similar to these.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another year<br/>
or so.  By that time, who knows how the game will work.<br/>

&gt; &gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider<br/>
&gt; it a<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.<br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>
&gt; want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>
&gt; cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>
&gt; and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>
&gt; effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>
