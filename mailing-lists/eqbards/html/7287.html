 </span></blockquote>    Ok, this is how it&#39;s done (I&#39;ve never personally done this btw).<br/>
When you teach another PC, their skill goes up to your skill + 1.  So<br/>
what you do is:<br/>
<br/>
1)  You teach the other person, until their skill is maxed (i.e., it<br/>
    becomes your skill + 1)<br/>
2)  The both of you zone (to update the skill list, like, if you get <br/>
    trained in a language up to excellent, you have to zone before it <br/>
    shows up as excellent)<br/>
3)  The other person now has your skill + 1, so he teaches you (to his<br/>
    skill + 1, which is your skill + 2)<br/>
4)  Zone<br/>
5)  Repeat<br/>
<br/>
Eventually you&#39;ll max it.<br/>
