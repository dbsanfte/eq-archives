<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006463706">Hail all.<br/>
<br/>
I am Atonal Steelstring, as most of you know from my posts on here.  I have<br/>
a request.<br/>
<br/>
I am level 35.  My guild is level 55+.  However, leaving my guild is not an<br/>
option.  They are truly my friends, as much as any friend I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>
Leaving them would be like leaving family.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time, when I was closer in level to them, however, I don&#39;t get a<br/>
whole lot of playing time, and never have.  As a result, I&#39;ve been<br/>
outlevelled.<br/>
<br/>
My request is simple.  I&#39;m missing huge portions of the game, being limited<br/>
strictly to pickup groups in such everyday places as FM and OT.  I&#39;m missing<br/>
doing the truly fun and dangerous stuff like Nurga, Droga, Dalnir, Guk, etc.<br/>
because I have no one to raid with.  I&#39;m sick of the safe, boring, pull kill<br/>
pull kill pull kill exp grind sitting on the side of a hill, with the only<br/>
danger being wandering Dragoons and inept groups.  I want to dungeon crawl.<br/>
I&#39;m sick of dying due to ebay pullers (no offense to ebayers in general,<br/>
just ebayers who don&#39;t at least start a new char to learn on before<br/>
subjecting the rest of us to inept high level characters).  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
deaths....as long as I can sit back while I&#39;m &#39;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&#39;ing,<br/>
and say, Damn, that was AMAZING!<br/>
<br/>
If any of you will have me, please consider me when doing mid-level raids.<br/>
If any of your guilds are of the appropriate level, I&#39;d be glad to drop by<br/>
your message boards and post a note, to introduce myself.  Just send me a<br/>
link.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
