strategy on Vox runs is to stamina drain her so she can&#39;t get<br/>
as many complete heals off.  Vox (and probably Naggy) were<br/>
changed so that they can&#39;t be stunned/bashed/mesmerized to<br/>
interrupt their casting anymore.<br/>

Dunno how our song compares to their spell, or even if it<br/>
stacks.<br/>
