&gt;Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>
&gt;Clarity)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon<br/>
&gt;on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>
&gt;seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this<br/>
&gt;means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the<br/>
&gt;song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>
&gt;Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>
&gt;Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>
&gt;does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.<br/>
