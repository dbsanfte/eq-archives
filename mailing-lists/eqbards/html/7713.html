&gt; I hate to say this, but you&#39;ve misspoken.  Gain some levels and <br/>
&gt; graduate from Blackburrow.  We had to Succor to North Karana<br/>
&gt; 3 f&#39;ing times the other night.  It&#39;s a MINIMUM 10 min run<br/>
&gt; back to Permafrost.  But the casters just personal gated <br/>
&gt; right back into the action.  It doesn&#39;t always have to do<br/>
&gt; with corpse recovery.  I was bound in Halas, and _still_ had<br/>
&gt; a long walk ahead of me.   I am the fasting moving thing in <br/>
&gt; Norrath save two things, bards higher than me and SoN.<br/>

back from an evac? Not that I disagree but I think what really is the<br/>
problem in your case here is that there&#39;s not gates in that part of the<br/>
world at all which is a huge oversight on Verant&#39;s part. There&#39;s a druid<br/>
circle in Perma, IIRC, but no spell to gate there. I haven&#39;t run across<br/>
a wizard circle there though. But I think we&#39;d have a hell of a lot<br/>
better chance of getting gates to everfrost put in the game than to get<br/>
other classes gate and bind. To see how inflexible Brad and Co. are on<br/>
their supposed balance of the classes check out this interview a Rogue<br/>
managed to get with Brad at the LA gathering.<br/>

If Brad and Co. won&#39;t make changes to Rogues, arguably one of the most<br/>
borken classes in the game, I think the chances of much change to gate<br/>
and bind are pretty non-existant. All Verant seems to do for class<br/>
balance now is take things away from other classes, not add things,<br/>
unless it&#39;s the Ranger, where a supposed typo had some of their combat<br/>
values set lower than supposedly they were supposed to be.<br/>
