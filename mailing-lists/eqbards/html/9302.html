<b>Subject:</b> Re: Usefullness of Jig <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240419956">Jig is useful at my level (25) i was grouped with 2 SK and a paladin,<br/>
fighting conituous battles (that is, i was able to heal them enought<br/>
that we had ZERO down time, since they taunted well and spread out the<br/>
damage among them). after 2 or 3 battles they would say OOS (out of<br/>
stamina) and i would switch from anthem, chain, heal to anthem, jig,<br/>
heal. Later i figured out it was better to START with anthem, jig, heal,<br/>
and switch to chain only when the mob was about to run.<br/>
<br/>
Jig allowed us to fight mobs for a good 15 minutes without rest. As in<br/>
one after the other, without pausing at all. which ever tank was<br/>
strongest would run and pull, when the mod was down to 20% hp.<br/>
<br/>
After 15 minutes or so of fighting, we would have to rest for mana and<br/>
just to top off health, then we were back at it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, there are a couple that are arguably useless (or so I hear, not at a<br/>
&gt; level to see for myself), so not having ALL your songs doesn&#39;t make you less<br/>
&gt; of a bard (imho).  I&#39;ve got two bards at level 8 on two servers.  The second<br/>
&gt; one I started never bought Jig and hasn&#39;t missed it yet.  Eventually I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get that one, but stamina hasn&#39;t been a thing to worry about yet.<br/>
