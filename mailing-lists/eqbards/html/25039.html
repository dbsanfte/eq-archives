<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Two: Only use &#39;name brand&#39; memory.  Yeah, I know you can go <br/>
&gt; out on the web<br/>
&gt; and buy that stick of pc-100 128 mb of ram for 1/3 of what CompUSA or<br/>
&gt; whoever charges, but there is a reason for that...<br/>
&gt; If you are gonna get new memory, don&#39;t be cheap and go ahead and get<br/>
&gt; Kingston or VisionTek or such. Yeah, it&#39;ll cost you a bit <br/>
&gt; more in the short<br/>
&gt; term, but it&#39;ll make you alot happier in the long run.  <br/>
&gt; (Compaq and HP both<br/>
&gt; use Kingston, or used to, even though it&#39;s labeled as Compaq or HP).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye I myself say Kingston or Micron :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My machine is home-built, and I&#39;ve only put in the best parts <br/>
&gt; I could put my<br/>
&gt; hands on, i.e. SB Live, Hercules GEForce, Adaptec SCSI, <br/>
&gt; Maxtor HDD (40GB<br/>
&gt; UDMA 100), and NAME BRAND MEMORY.  I crash, but that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; because I have who<br/>
&gt; knows what loaded on my system...I run every game I come <br/>
&gt; across, beta&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; demo&#39;s, etc. etc. etc., and usually the crashes are from some <br/>
&gt; of that, and<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t real common.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Im using a homebuilt system too. Much like yours (Although I still need to<br/>
upgrade my HD and will most likely buy a IBM ATA100)<br/>
You mention that your PC crashes and there is a little thing that I know I<br/>
overlooked when I built my machine and that is the fact that the AGP port<br/>
and the PCI port right next to it - shares resources! I put my SB LIVE next<br/>
to my AGP port, because I did not know better (Hey the last machine I put<br/>
together was a P166 with PCI and ISA). The result was that my GeForce and my<br/>
SBLive shared interrupt!! While WIN98 says that is ok my machine crashed<br/>
alot esp when gaming (most activity on GFX and sound)!!<br/>
I tried everything. Until I finally detected that graphics and sound shared<br/>
interrupt and moved my SB to another slot.<br/>
Since then I very rarely have system freezes. You can check your IRQ<br/>
settings and make sure that no interrupts are shared. I had to remove an old<br/>
ISA LPT port I have in order to free enough interrupt, so that no int was<br/>
shared..<br/>
<br/>
Well its just an idea if you dident know about it..<br/>
