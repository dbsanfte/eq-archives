<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620533454">Okay, I have a few minutes to do this ;o)~<br/>
<br/>
10-19 The Karanas.  More importantly, North Karana fighting wolves and<br/>
bears, then moving to EK and camping Reaver Hill.<br/>
<br/>
19-22  Lake Rathe.  Hunting aviaks was great experience.  Favorite spot?<br/>
The Cove.<br/>
<br/>
22-28  South Karana.  The Hermit and I go waaaaaaaaaaaay back.  Not only is<br/>
he great exp, but he can drop up to 2p 6g, and FS weapons from time to time,<br/>
*but* he is a 4 & 1/2 minutes spawn (approx.).  If he was still giving me<br/>
exp, I&#39;ld probably still be camping him ;o)~<br/>
<br/>
28-32  Lake of Ill Omen.  (Thank GOD for RoK!)  Hang out at the gobbie caves<br/>
for the first 2 levels (no one is ever camping the back entrance), then move<br/>
over to the Sarnak fortress.  There is a little plataeu not far from where<br/>
the path runs out that is *perfect* for pulling to.<br/>
<br/>
33-35  Lots of places.  One of the best places I&#39;ve found is getting into a<br/>
giant group at the FV giant camps.  This gives good exp to me still at 35,<br/>
and they are just now starting to cone white.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; My experience:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10-15 West Commons and S Ro hunting Dervs.  There is a<br/>
&gt; guy in S. Ro you can turn rings in to for some xp and<br/>
&gt; faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 15-20 Lake Rathetear or hunt orcs in the Rathe Mtns.<br/>
&gt; There is an orc village near the Paladin Camp in the<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mtns that is seldom camped.  I recommend a<br/>
&gt; partner for this.  you can run to the Pally camp if<br/>
&gt; you get into trouble<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 20-30 Lake of Ill Omen.  Start near the ruins on the<br/>
&gt; South side of the lake, then look at the gob mines in<br/>
&gt; the NW corner, then the Sarnak Castle in the NE<br/>
&gt; corner. (cool stuff drops in the castle)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
&gt; stuck in the first lvl of hell<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10-12 Blackburrow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I know it inside out and it is a great dungeon<br/>
&gt; &gt; for bards)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-15 Kurns Tower<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which means dropping lots of silver, but all<br/>
&gt; &gt; those warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; love being hasted)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 15-20 Unrest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I never hunted there before as my previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle it)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 20-25 Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I took Tszaaz from 25-30 there, it might get<br/>
&gt; &gt; tedious, might not)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not feeling particularly inspired by this<br/>
&gt; &gt; list however.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions for when, as a bard, to go where I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m entirely unqualified to give you advice, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to know why<br/>
&gt; &gt; you feel Blackburrow is such a good dungeon for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards.  I&#39;ve found it to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; successfully hunt there with<br/>
&gt; &gt; either my bard, shaman, wizard, or rogue.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand it&#39;s a good spot for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a necro though.  But then, what isn&#39;t?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Peace<br/>
