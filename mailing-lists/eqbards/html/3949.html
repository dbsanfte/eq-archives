<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064575036"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     Fix.  Randomly put the good stuff on different High level mobs.  Then<br/>
&gt;     have them appear randomly in their zone.  Simple. (maybe not to<br/>
&gt;     program but that&#39;s not my problem)  Why does only the avatar (?) get<br/>
&gt;     the ruby Breastplate, and doesn&#39;t he ever go to the bathroom, or take<br/>
&gt;     a stroll around his domain?  Visit his friends or check out why his<br/>
&gt;     guards are letting these hoards of uptight homicidal maniacs into his<br/>
&gt;     throne room...  This would add a random element to the location of the<br/>
&gt;     item and mob and would make camping at least a little less attractive.<br/>
&gt;      I HATE camping.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Agreed, camping is terrible.  It breeds all the worst parts of EQ,<br/>
killstealing, wallflower wizards, dropping trains on people.  Your above<br/>
solutions all would help, but I still believe the major solution is to flood<br/>
the world with alternative items.  If every dungeon had 3 clones (same lvls<br/>
of critters, and roughly equivilent treasure tables) of it, with a few<br/>
subtle differences of it, we&#39;d see a much better situation.  Sure Cazic&#39;s<br/>
great for 27-30+ and you can pull out rubicite, but if there were 3 other<br/>
27-30+ dungeons that had opalite, emeraldite, and sapphirite, we&#39;d at least<br/>
have 1/4th the people in all the dungeons.<br/>

&gt;     who has a nose for Plat.  No exploits or cheating, he just knows where<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    The unfortunate thing that will eventually happen is slowly starting to<br/>
occur already... plat is becoming more & more devalued.  Most high-end items<br/>
currently can only be traded for other high-end items & not bought at all.<br/>
Jewelcraft is helping ward this off a little bit, but we desperately need<br/>
more uses for plat at higher levels....</div>
