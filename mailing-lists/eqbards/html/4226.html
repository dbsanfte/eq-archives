<div id="ygrps-yiv-614082728">Reminds me of the time my uild was passing around our equipment wish<br/>
lists, to keep things short everyone was layering in the acrnyms like &quot;I<br/>
would love to get a EHG, THB, TBC, BIC, and a BSM.&quot;  Suffice to say we<br/>
ended wasting even more time when one of us couldn&#39;t identify one of the<br/>
acronym.  Then we were caught in a constant banter of what the heck is<br/>
this.  This made chatting longer and caused problems while we were all<br/>
jumped by some mobs in Runnyeye.  Theres nothing more embarassing then<br/>
blurting &quot;What is a eq1211&quot;<br/>

BTW: That was Elf-Hide gloves Troll Hide Belt, Thulian Bladed Claw, Black<br/>
Iron Crown and Blood Stained Mantle =).  Besides is it not easier to just<br/>
do this first time you want to use an acronym like the following.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;text deleteds&gt; Bone bladed Claymore(BBC) &lt;text deleted&gt;BBC<br/>
<br/>
That way you get your acronyms and the person reading can learn them?  Not<br/>
to much hassle if you plan to mention BBC a few times.<br/>

&gt; The funny thing about the acronym-itus that has struck in EverQuest (note I<br/>
&gt; did not use EQ?  hehe), is that one of our regular group members makes up<br/>
&gt; acronyms on the spot.  Very unnerving for the rest of us.  He&#39;ll spout one<br/>
&gt; of these off and the rest of us stand around, looking carefully at each<br/>
&gt; other, trying to discern if anyone else knows the meaning.  Then we all<br/>
&gt; look at him and say &quot;What??&quot;.  After countless times, he is still doing<br/>
&gt; this.  <br/>
