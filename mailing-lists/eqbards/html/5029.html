<div id="ygrps-yiv-914001062">Hmmm. I have played a monk quite a bit and my experience<br/>
is a little different. The base AC was the main factor when<br/>
fighting blues. The rate at which I got critical hit<br/>
seemed to be the same regardless of armor type. However, when<br/>
fighting yellows or reds, going from cloth/netted to leather<br/>
or leather to LJ tunic made a big difference in how often I got<br/>
criticaled. Second, the difference did not become large until<br/>
around level 20. But by 20, the difference between a LJ tunic<br/>
and a leather tunic was significant regardless of buffs when<br/>
fighting yellows or reds (and later whites). So the test<br/>
results may be both level specific and dependent on the relative<br/>
level of the mob. <br/>
<br/>
Another consideration is that Verant has stated that armor has<br/>
an antitwinking element to it such that you dont get the full<br/>
benefit of it till you reach a certain level. Therefore, the person<br/>
testing this theory would need to be at least 30 to be certain<br/>
that they are getting the full benefit of plate.<br/>

I think it was the Rogues list this came up on before ...<br/>
<br/>
Someone did tests through naked, PW/leather, Banded/Bronze.  They used<br/>
buffs to raise the AC in a lower armor to match thier unbuffed AC in a<br/>
higher armor.  <br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;d have person with AC X in leather with buffs, and then same<br/>
person with same AC X in bronze but unbuffed.  This was done with different<br/>
AC X&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The results posted of the most well designed tests indicated that the<br/>
protection factors are rolled into the AC.  The damage and damage pattern<br/>
was the same at AC X, regardless of what armor/spells got you to AC X.<br/>
This was true for more than one AC X.  Would anyone on this list care to<br/>
replicate the tests?<br/>
