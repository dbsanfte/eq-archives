<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784040066">O.K. i&#39;m only tell you guys this because your bards,<br/>
the cracked darkwood shield is found in high hold pass<br/>
of a named gnoll, one of the two mucktails.  One<br/>
mucktail carries this shield, the other carries a<br/>
polished granite tomahawk.  Both only spawn about<br/>
every 4-6 hours.  If you enter the pass from the west,<br/>
it&#39;s the first up ramp on your right.  If your on E<br/>
Marr and need help tell me.  By the way, it took 4<br/>
level 16-18 to take him down, as he usally is accom.<br/>
by at least 2 flame paws.  <br/>
