<div id="ygrps-yiv-662147078"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Any tips/strategies?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, i can&#39;t say what our strategy is (insert uber-guild flame here).  i<br/>
don&#39;t like saying that, but i have to abide by it.  i will say that i don&#39;t<br/>
think we ever tried the air pet attack, and i don&#39;t think our one cleric<br/>
with MoK (awesome spell and extremely rare) has gotten it to land on trak<br/>
yet.  it took us a few wipe outs to figure out the best way, and i&#39;m sure<br/>
you guys will too and feel much better getting it on your own.<br/>

&gt; casted on, hit<br/>
&gt; once and fd with 25hp, he FD his way to the zone, funny screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol those crazy monks.  i bet it took him a little bit of time to go that<br/>
far FDing the whole way hehe.<br/>
