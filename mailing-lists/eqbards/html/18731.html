<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082298264">You will be disappointed I fear.  The proc is a level 8 wizard spell that<br/>
does 28 points of AoE damage centered on the user.  Can you say<br/>
demezmerizing mega-taunt?  I thought you could.<br/>
<br/>
At least its great if you get surrounded by a horde of moss snakes you<br/>
couldn&#39;t Lullaby while doing some testing to prove just that.<br/>

Got one...WOOOO! It was a rare drop from a Guildmate, so I have no idea<br/>
where it came from.<br/>
<br/>
5/18<br/>
Effect: Fingers of Fire<br/>
Wt: 2.8<br/>
Class BRD<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone know what the effect is? And I was fighting in SolA last<br/>
night with it, I am not sure but I *think*  it never proc&#39;d. Does anyone one<br/>
know if there is a level at which it starts?<br/>
