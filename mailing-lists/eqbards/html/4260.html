<div id="ygrps-yiv-775275720"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     Just a couple of suggestion, there are many other areas.  Umm actually<br/>
&gt;     if you feel rally brave you can sprint to Misty Thicket near<br/>
&gt;     Rivervale. I think it is the best place to level up to 10-12th in the<br/>
&gt;     game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Getting to Misty Thicket should be easy for a 6th level bard, as I<br/>
made it from Halas with a 6th level Shaman.  The entire way  I was<br/>
saying &quot;I would KILL for my Selo&#39;s back&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Leveling in Misty is really easy to 9.  I don&#39;t know about after.  I made<br/>
a visit there when I was  9th level bard, and didn&#39;t see a lot to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
The goblin camps and the orc camps get camped out a lot.<br/>
