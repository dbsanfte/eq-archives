<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160293348">I had similar results when I practiced my Brass skill near the Shady<br/>
Swashbuckler.  Spurts of successive skill increases then long droughts in<br/>
between the next spurt.  If a lot of other people have had similar<br/>
experiences, the question to ask is why does the game seem only to check for<br/>
skill increases at certain intervals?  <br/>

&gt; &gt;check or advance messages right after starting the song.  Then <br/>
&gt; &gt;non for very long time.  But a quick 2 may be 3 each time I <br/>
&gt; &gt;stopped and restarted the song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can confirm this.<br/>

&gt; When I came back to the keyboard after 2 hours, this is what I saw.<br/>
