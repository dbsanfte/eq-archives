<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657445252">Unless it has been changed in the last two weeks the effect DOES linger for <br/>
the 15 secs after they leave the radius.  I used it to help a solo player <br/>
get out of Upper Guk with out causing a train :)  Good trade since he cast <br/>
Regenerate on me for the aid.  The most annoying thing with this song to me <br/>
is the fact it will randomly stop working for a tick, no missed note, no <br/>
invis canceling action on my part.  This can be deadly when using the song <br/>
to scout a hostile area, I started a fairly good sized train once in Guk <br/>
because of this.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Couple things I&#39;ve learned about the invisibility song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) The effect does not &quot;linger&quot; if your party members move out<br/>
&gt;of range like other bard songs do.  When they move out of<br/>
&gt;range, they immediately blink into sight.  This seriously<br/>
&gt;decreases its usefulness for group movement and corpse<br/>
&gt;recovery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) If one of your party members blinks into sight and is<br/>
&gt;attacked, then moves back into the song&#39;s influence, the next<br/>
&gt;song tick the mobs will start attacking you even though you<br/>
&gt;are still invisible.  Your song helped someone being attacked,<br/>
&gt;so they will now attack you, invisibile or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) My friends were telling me that the song was canceling<br/>
&gt;their invisibility to undead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In short, the song is probably only useful in solo play, and<br/>
&gt;if your group is not moving.  Disappointing to say the least.<br/>
&gt;Anyone know if it&#39;s intended to be this way?  Perhaps we could<br/>
&gt;petition to get (1) fixed.  The effect does &quot;linger&quot; with you<br/>
&gt;for two ticks if you stop singing.<br/>
