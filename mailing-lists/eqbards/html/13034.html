<div id="ygrps-yiv-263144082">So if we are in a situation where we need to keep several mobs out of the<br/>
fight with Lullaby, should we stop and restart the song as soon as we see<br/>
the &quot;head nods&quot; message or should we just keep it playing continuously?<br/>
Since the song only pulses every 6 seconds, and the duration of the song&#39;s<br/>
effect is 3-5 seconds, my guess is that stopping and restarting would work<br/>
better.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when<br/>
&gt; twisted <br/>
&gt; with another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area Mezmerize, use <br/>
&gt; ONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) The song seems quite effective as long as one remembers it is NOT a <br/>
&gt; multiple-tick song. Only 1 tick, so you have to keep singing it constantly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for the continuous effects.<br/>
