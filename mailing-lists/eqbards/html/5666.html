<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464302956">Mobs do change levels and acquire new skills if they raise high enough. Also<br/>
it may have had spirit sight cast on it by another nearby mob. Aside from<br/>
this I know some Undead see invis just fine whil others not at all. I have<br/>
had Festering hags not see me if they are green to me, and then a blue one<br/>
sees me and scowls. I have walked all the way into the ghost room unmolested<br/>
and other times a greater skel or hag will see me. In lower guk all the<br/>
ghouls see invis just fine, while in upper all that can see me is the Warden<br/>
and the Lord. I never trust past experience with invis in any area I dont<br/>
know as gospel. Unrest is one of those places you never know whats going to<br/>
happen next, I dont care how long you have played there.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Almost every time I think something saw through my<br/>

&gt; &gt;I was attacked is &quot;you become visible.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hrm - there has always been some error with the cause and effect timing.<br/>
&gt; Notice how whenever you are bashed, your song ends *before* the monster<br/>
&gt; bashes you?  Methinks that they hit you, removing the invisibility.  Now<br/>
&gt; how they saw you - well, who knows?<br/>
<br/>
Well, unless you can explain how a mob that I&#39;d safely walked<br/>
through a dozen times before while invisible could suddenly<br/>
see me, I will go with the invisibility blinking off as the<br/>
explanation. :-)<br/>
