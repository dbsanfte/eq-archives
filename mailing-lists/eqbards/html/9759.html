<div id="ygrps-yiv-674206602">I used this song to great effect while in permafrost way back when I was<br/>
level 16 (oh so long ago).  It was great.   Resist rates were rather low<br/>
and I could usually pull 1 or 2 at a time which is good for perma.. I then<br/>
began adventuring in outdoor zones where harmony is much more effective due<br/>
to it being aoe and not agroing monsters if it fails.  Recently though, I<br/>
was reminded of the song while reading this list and realized that it would<br/>
probably work wonders in Sol B and Lower Guk where I have been adventuring<br/>
lately.  My first real test of the song in lower guk was when I decided I<br/>
would solo while I waited for a group to open up a spot for me.  From dead<br/>
side if you take a left at the first intersection, there are 5 different<br/>
live frog spawns and a few undead spawns.  I would lull the frogs and pull<br/>
singles and solo them.  I eventually teamed up with another bard and we<br/>
double teamed them with me pulling until we eventually got a group on live<br/>
side doing the elder room which I ended up doing most of the pulls as the<br/>
spawn times for the entire maze were staggered and I figured out the<br/>
pattern (so we were doing patriarch room as well).  By the way has anyone<br/>
noticed that nearly all of lower guk is now camped during peak hours?  Im<br/>
talking seeing less than 5 frogs on tracking most of the time and all named<br/>
spots taken.  <br/>
The second true test was when we were doing the assassin and I volunteered<br/>
to pull from the lower levels and I broke those spawns easily with the<br/>
level 8 song as well.  The third and perhaps most impressive test was when<br/>
our group after a rather unfortuante bug where we all had our computers<br/>
crash in the middle of a fight with 3 spiders (gms wouldnt rez us due to it<br/>
being a supposed connectivity problem what bs) decided to kill the gibs.  I<br/>
said let me pull I should be able to pull 1 or 2 at a time.  They all<br/>
laughed at the suicidal bard and said sure if you want.  So I went in and<br/>
after about a minute of targeting and lulling (quite difficult) pulled the<br/>
one closest to the bed room.  Both of them on that side came and we easily<br/>
dispatched them.  I then went in again, lulled the 3 that remained and<br/>
pulled the one closest.  Again 2 came which was easily handled.  Everyone<br/>
was very impressed and surprised.  This is with lute equipped and a chr of<br/>
108 btw.  I think in indoor dungeons we are just behind monks in most<br/>
pulling situations and in the case of casters such as gibs or the wizards<br/>
outside the dead tower, we are better.<br/>
So all of you higher level bards who have forgotten this gem of a song go<br/>
try it next time you hit lower guk and you dont have a monk to pull (or<br/>
your monk sucks).  I suspect you will be pleasantly surprised.  Oh and<br/>
remind me to get a bunch of shuriekens for pulling.. pulling with chains is<br/>
just a bad idea.<br/>
