<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I thought about this some more, and the above is probably the<br/>
&gt; reason why this issue is so polarized.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you subscribe to the &quot;everyone should be free to play the<br/>
&gt; way they like&quot; ideology, then people who withhold help from<br/>
&gt; twinkers are treating them differently based on how they play<br/>
&gt; the game, and thus violating the ideology.  So it isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; double standard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you subscribe to the &quot;your actions should not detract from<br/>
&gt; others&#39; gameplay&quot; ideology, then twinking detracts from your<br/>
&gt; gameplay and you should withhold help from twinkers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whichever ideology you subscribe to, your actions and feelings<br/>
&gt; are self-consistent, and the other ideology&#39;s actions are a<br/>
&gt; violation.  They are mutually exclusive, and thus there can be<br/>
&gt; no resolution or compromise between the two.  The best we can<br/>
&gt; hope for is coexistence without resorting to petty insults<br/>
&gt; (twinker or jealousy).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we can agree to that, I&#39;d like to end the twinking thread.<br/>
