<b>Subject:</b> RE: mino horn on Innourkk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139566650">A minotaur will most likely /con green to any character in their 20s.  You<br/>
don&#39;t need the help of 30+ characters to kill one.  I soloed chasm minotaurs<br/>
in the Gorge of King Xorbb when I was 22d level.  The minos in Steamfont are<br/>
even easier.  If you are less than 20th level then a small group is probably<br/>
necessary.  The mino horns provide no bonus to bard songs and the graphic<br/>
for them looks like a pouch so the demand for these is quite small.  You<br/>
could probably go to these zones and auction for one if you really want one<br/>
that bad.  If your intent is to take on the Mino Hero himself then the 30+<br/>
characters will come in handy.<br/>
