<b>Subject:</b> What is a PvP zone? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-633962292">I have heard some people on the list serve mention PvP zones what are they?<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a seperate note, I am having the problem where one of my songs will <br/>
get stuck on and I can&#39;t turn it off to switch songs. This is very annoying. <br/>
It won&#39;t turn off till I zone or camp and come back. Any idea how I can <br/>
prevent this? I think it is a bug or something. Has anyone else had this <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
