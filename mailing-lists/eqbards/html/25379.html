<div id="ygrps-yiv-369212491">I thought they were looking into the whole business of the inferior mez<br/>
never being overwritten by the superior mez? I really wish they would do<br/>
that. I think bards would be much more enchanter friendly then as we could<br/>
fast mez the spares when you get a big pull and the chanter would then have<br/>
a few extra seconds to target and cast their better mez. I think it would<br/>
save tons of chanter deaths.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know anything about killing the CS otters? Are they on any faction<br/>
with dragons, giants, or dwarves? I need something to tailor above 158.<br/>
