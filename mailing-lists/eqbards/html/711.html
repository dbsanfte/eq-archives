<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553526251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I like what Sam says, especially the encouragement to go for light but<br/>
&gt;effective, high-class armor and strength-enhancing magic items.  For me<br/>
&gt;that fits better with my concept of a bard.  It doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>
&gt;for a bard to be dressed like a tank in full plate.  I&#39;d far rather see<br/>
&gt;bards dressed in things that are light, effective, and exotic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For example, I spent money on two gold earring that don&#39;t even show unless<br/>
&gt;you inspect me closely and give me no improvements.  They fit my concept.<br/>
&gt;I look forward to trading them for something equally charismatic and with a<br/>
&gt;practical touch of magic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I split my extra stat points mostly among strength, which I figured was<br/>
&gt;good for my fighter side, and charisma, which has been good for my ability<br/>
&gt;to make money and fits perfectly with my concept of a bard as the charming,<br/>
&gt;rogueish musician who&#39;s pretty good in a fight.  As I recall I may have put<br/>
&gt;some into agility, too, as some of those rogueish skills could someday<br/>
&gt;prove quite useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I find a deep sense of character an important enhancement to raw capability<br/>
&gt;and ultimately the higher driving force.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bravo! I never even thought about the rogue skills until I got my first one <br/>
and then I was thinking damn maybe I should&#39;ve put some more points into <br/>
those stats. I probly will next time I start up a bard.<br/>
Anyways, it is good to be able to haul loot, but I usually just end up <br/>
dropping any heavy stuff that&#39;s not worth as much if I am not wanting to hit <br/>
a merchant right away. (Hmmm, where are those belt shops people keep <br/>
boasting about each time I&#39;m in Crushbone? =)<br/>
<br/>
Yes hauling loot is good, but I think of strength in terms of combat more <br/>
than being a pack animal and bard songs, magic items, and buff spells help a <br/>
great deal with that. I may not be as rich, but that&#39;s ok with me. I think I <br/>
was doing fine, I had a full suit of real leather armor before I ever hit <br/>
5th level so I think I was doing ok.<br/>
