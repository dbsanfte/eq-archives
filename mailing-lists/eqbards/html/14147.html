<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I can back up the claim that Mask of Deception gives ultravision fine. I<br/>
&gt; used it crossing through Neriak as well as in LGuk and got the blue tinge<br/>
&gt; from it. It seemed to hold up also as I sang my accelerando through<br/>
&gt; Neriak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t notice whether this effect went away when I have turned off a<br/>
&gt; song,<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
