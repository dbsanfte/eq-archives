<b>Subject:</b> Attack speedups <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-911302178">I did some more informal timings this weekend while we were<br/>
camping Ghoulbane for two of my paladin friends.  We had a L31<br/>
enchanter in the group so I got a chance to time my attack<br/>
speeds.  The results had about a half second of variability<br/>
across 10 attacks, which works to +/- 2% or so.  I tested with<br/>
both my dirk (delay 23) and whip (delay 28) in my primary hand<br/>
and got the same percentage speedup.<br/>
<br/>
The percentage I list is [(normal time)/(enhanced time) - 1 ]<br/>
as that seemed to produce &quot;round&quot; numbers that I suspect are<br/>
what the programmers coded.<br/>
<br/>
Songs:<br/>
Anthem - 10%<br/>
Warsong - 20% (this is an improvement over the 15% I saw at L17)<br/>
<br/>
Spells:<br/>
Augmentation - 20%<br/>
Quickness - 25%<br/>
Alacrity - 33%<br/>
<br/>
- The enchanter&#39;s speedups are faster than ours.<br/>
<br/>
- None of these stacked - the faster always took precedence.<br/>
<br/>
- Warsong seems to be improving with my level, which kinda<br/>
makes sense if they wanted to keep our self-only battle song<br/>
&quot;competetive&quot; with Celerity which we get at L36.<br/>
