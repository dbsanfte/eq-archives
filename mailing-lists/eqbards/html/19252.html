<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107564585">Ouch.  I survived all the LD&#39;s, including the last one.  Unfortunately now<br/>
for all I know I may be standing inside the Giant fort in Warsliks Woods.  I<br/>
logged back on far enough to see where my character was and whether he was<br/>
naked or not and then gave up.<br/>
<br/>
None of the suggestions in the banner had any effect on the lockups by the<br/>
way.  I tried them all.  I wish they would just actually fix the problems<br/>
instead of always saying reinstall Directx 7.0a.  I have a friend who has<br/>
been plagued with mobs turning into male humans, including the boat!  You<br/>
can not ride a boat that is a male human btw.  She is also plagued with<br/>
occasional crashes that force a hard reboot as well.  Every call to tech<br/>
support has received the same mantric response.  &quot;Delete you character .opt<br/>
files.  <br/>
<br/>
Reinstall Directx 7.0a.  Reinstall your video drivers.&quot;  None of these has<br/>
had any effect.  Ever.  She even reformatted her hard drive and reinstalled<br/>
everything from scratch, no change.  For the past three months camping a<br/>
character causes a crash of EQ to the desktop 75% of time.<br/>

I too experienced these same problems in the same zone, Kit (btw, nice<br/>
chatting with you last night).  I&#39;ve only gone LD a total of 3 times before<br/>
in the last year of playing.  Last night I went LD twice.  The last time I<br/>
went LD, I ended up dying.  It was at this point that I gave up for the<br/>
night.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Patch effects (OT)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was the stated reason for the patch, but I found that either it had<br/>
quite the opposite effect, or by coincidence there were far more connection<br/>
problems last nite than I have ever seen in 14+ months of play.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
been disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>
modem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.  On about<br/>
half those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>
disconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>
<br/>
I was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
showed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>
seen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>
at work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>
sources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>
game was totally unplayable last night.<br/>
<br/>

      Somewhere in Warsliks Woods, only wish I knew where<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The servers were down for an emergency patch today.<br/>
&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that were causing<br/>
people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>
months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>
