<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-128966337">Oh yea, a few more questions I came up with this weekend:<br/>
<br/>
Should I be developing more than 1HS weapon skill?  (in terms of<br/>
weapons?)<br/>
Has anyone tried to make a group of 6 bards doing that AOE song and just<br/>
walk around in a dungeon?  I&#39;m just curious how effective that group<br/>
would be?<br/>
What do you guys do with all your practices (hmm maybe I should see<br/>
question 1)?  It seems most of our skills going up pretty well on their<br/>
own with  alittle priming...<br/>
I was using the Discord song to just kite fire beetles for real nice xp<br/>
at lvl 3, is this considered an abuse? (I actualyl try to never take<br/>
advantage of games &quot;flaws&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, thanks to all the bards who helped me this weekend!  You guys<br/>
(and gals) are the best!<br/>
