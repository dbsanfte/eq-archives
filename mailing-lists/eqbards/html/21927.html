&quot;Why is higher level spell a downgrade to a lower level one?<br/>
<br/>
Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens: Target charm, short duration.<br/>
Solon&#39;s Bravura: Target charm, short duration, higher level cap, decreases<br/>
magic resistance, costs mana.<br/>
<br/>
Bravura has a higher level cap, but it has a double resist rate (once for<br/>
the Charm, once for the MR decrease) and it costs mana. Also, the MR<br/>
decrease is completely worthless, WORSE than worthless because it makes the<br/>
pet weaker than it was before it was charmed! Meanwhile you can&#39;t cast on it<br/>
so the lower MR is not useful to you in the least.<br/>
<br/>
Why does it decrease Magic Resistance? There&#39;s no point to it except to make<br/>
the song less worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gordon&#39;s reply:<br/>
<br/>
The components don&#39;t resist separatly. Spells only save versus one resist,<br/>
and only save once unless special code is put in to have them do something<br/>
else, such as with Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
The magic resistance probably makes it a bad spell component combo. When the<br/>
coder comes in tomorrow I&#39;ll see if that has any possible positive effect.<br/>
If not, we&#39;ll look at another potential component.<br/>
<br/>

Barbiturique responds:<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t understand how charm work. At every tick (or so) your charmed pet<br/>
will make a MR check to see if he can break your charm. That is why charm<br/>
duration appears to be random. Lowering his MR will generally make the charm<br/>
last longer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gordon slips out of the discussion with:<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s certainly a possibility, but I&#39;ll find out for certain tomorrow.<br/>

It seems this was posted on Tuesday, and there&#39;s yet to be a response based<br/>
on his findings.<br/>
<br/>
I was all ready to tag my thoughts onto this, but I&#39;ve just been called to a<br/>
meeting (*sigh* - I hate when work interrupts), so I&#39;ll leave you lot to<br/>
discuss and I&#39;ll catch up later. :)</div>
