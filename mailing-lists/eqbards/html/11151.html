<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998704962">Ok, well if Verant did truly intend Selo&#39;s to break root, they sure did<br/>
a sloppy job with it.<br/>
When you cure a disease, or dispel a buff, etc the appropriate icon and<br/>
effect is taken off to indicate this effect has been cancelled. Not so<br/>
with Selo&#39;s breaking root, so it would appear to be buggy. And as for<br/>
sitting there being rooted after you zone, thats just ridiculous.<br/>
Either A) Verant is quite sloppy with their intentions for Selo&#39;s to<br/>
break root, or B) Its just a bug.<br/>
Choice A wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all.. I mean this is Verant afterall.<br/>
But I&#39;m inclined to believe choice B.<br/>
Now technically if its marked as a bug and you use it.. this is<br/>
exploiting. But as if Verant would care. So don&#39;t be a jerk and say<br/>
stuff like &quot;oh we should all be banned!&quot;<br/>
Anyways.. think my point is that the way its currently designed now, it<br/>
cannot be ruled out as a bug.<br/>
