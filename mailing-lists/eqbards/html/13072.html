<br/>
		I was running through SK last night and paid a visit to our<br/>
old friend<br/>
		Vhalen.  He was actually pretty chatty, singing me a ballad<br/>
and then telling<br/>
		me the story behind it.  He spoke of an old flame of his<br/>
(her name was<br/>
		Matala, I think -- notes are at home) and how she had dumped<br/>
him for someone<br/>
		else and was now up to some nefarious purposes.  I got<br/>
through the story and<br/>
		tried to get him to say more, but some idiot and his pet<br/>
chose that moment<br/>
		to whack the poor bard, so I can&#39;t be sure that I got<br/>
everything from him.<br/>
<br/>
		At the end of each section of text, Vhalen would ask if I<br/>
wanted him to go<br/>
		on, but there were no brackets on anything.  Typing in what<br/>
you would expect<br/>
		to type in kept him going, however (e.g. &quot;I would like to<br/>
hear more&quot;).<br/>
		Unfortunately, he never indicates any sort of action you<br/>
should take, he<br/>
		just says that Matala (if I remember her name correctly)<br/>
must be stopped.<br/>
		Anyone else spoken to him lately?  Is this an old quest that<br/>
I am just now<br/>
		discovering?  I&#39;d appreciate any guidance.<br/>

		Bard of 19 (almost 20) songs - Tunare<br/>
<br/>
In the south east cornor of SK is a house surrounded by a stone wall.<br/>
Inside lives this hermit who is a ranger about level 20, skilled in the use<br/>
of magic.  You can open the door to the wall but not to the house.  But you<br/>
have bardic songs that when played will make him come out and fight you.<br/>
You will need a good group to help you kill him - especially at your age.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think I ever solo&#39;d him (but then I don&#39;t kite) - maybe after I was<br/>
25.  He buffs himself with thorns and fights hard - with fine steel weapons<br/>
too. When you kill him, you will find a &quot;broken lute&quot; (that wieghs 10<br/>
pounds!) and a page to the song.  Keep one only of each.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how you are supposed to know this - I have no clue since I did it all<br/>
from spoilers but you take the flute to North Karana and give it to Cordelia<br/>
Minister - the bardette who loiters near the wizard spires and patrols to<br/>
the northwestern shops.  She will give you the other page of the song and<br/>
you go back to Vahlen.  Give him both pages and he will reward you with a<br/>
new song!  Viola - Chant of battle!  Just in case your spell book catches on<br/>
fire and you lose your existing song!  Woo Hoo am I ever glad I did that<br/>
quest!<br/>
<br/>
The good part is the xp for slaying the hermit - affectionately known as<br/>
Herman on our server and the FS weps he drops every 4 to 6 kills.<br/>
