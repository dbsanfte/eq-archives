<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156573515">Was running with a lvl 16 druid friend of mine alst night, and I fired up<br/>
the Jig (with instr.) and he was stunned.  Whether it only looked like it<br/>
was helping client-side or whether it really did help I don&#39;t know.  What I<br/>
do know is HE thought it helped  &gt;:oP<br/>
(And so the legend of the bard class grows...)  heh!<br/>
