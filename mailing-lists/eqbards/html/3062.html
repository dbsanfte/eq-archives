&gt; Well thats one of the main reasons I play on Zek. Some idiot steals your<br/>
&gt; kills repetedly, we just kill him or at least run him off. Or since you<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; a bard I remember the old train trick. this group kept stealing my scarabs<br/>
&gt; and was quite arrogant about it. I warned them then screw it. I trained A<br/>
&gt; derv cam to them. Funniest thing I ever saw. 6 plus people on the plat.<br/>
&gt; BOOM. All but 1 died in the party and the dervs killed a few others after<br/>
&gt; the prey zoned. Needless to say, ettiquette (spelling?)  was learned, and<br/>
&gt; the whole zone came polite after that incident. The non-pvp servers are<br/>
&gt; bogus and boring. Not a thing you can do about it. I learned that in Beta.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; No, all you have to claim is that you&#39;re trying to attack the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; monsters there, and the bigger guys keep taking it every time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; In this case, their misguided harassment definition (only<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; harassment if it&#39;s aimed at an individual) works in your<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; favor since they are literally killing everything you attack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I spent a fair deal of time arguing and debating this with a couple of<br/>
&gt; &gt;guides the other night.  I was playing my lvl 14 mage to help a<br/>
&gt; &gt;guildmember catch up to my lvl 20 bard.  We were camped out at the Orc<br/>
&gt; &gt;Camp in West Common and had this level 17+ character stealing our kills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The only reason why this situation was considered harassment was the fact<br/>
&gt; &gt;that this idiot actually told my group that we had to sell our orc belts<br/>
&gt; &gt;to him or else he would proceed to kill every orc until he had sufficient<br/>
&gt; &gt;orc belts for his cause.  After discussing this with a guide, this is<br/>
&gt; &gt;definitely harassment.  Kill stealing on the other hand is not.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;argument that all kill stealers use is the fact that there was no order,<br/>
&gt; &gt;or I need that item for a friend or the ever favourite well I began<br/>
&gt; &gt;casting when you attacked.  To me, Verant&#39;s stand on kill stealing is too<br/>
&gt; &gt;bad it is  a fact of life and hopefully these people will learn later on,<br/>
&gt; &gt;when no one will party with them.  Well I have yet to see any problem<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt;this, I have seen many people who have kill stole consistently and<br/>
&gt; &gt;predictably have no problems with grouping, in fact they are in a guild.<br/>
&gt; &gt;So there is no punishment for his actions ever.<br/>
