<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402617211">Exactly.  And the barbershop cannot refuse you service because you recite<br/>
erotic poetry in a public place outside their establishment.  That&#39;s why I<br/>
added the second post about VI&#39;s right to do what they did if it had<br/>
occurred in game, their equivalent of their establishment.<br/>

This is a tad mixed.  While you are certainly correct about<br/>
race/gender/etc, every private club (which represents a subscription<br/>
service like EQ), or business is allowed a no shoes/no service type clause.<br/>
The First Amendment cannot be invoked to allow you to recite erotic poetry<br/>
at your local barbershop.<br/>
<br/>
The barber can throw you out of his establishment.  Now, the law WILL allow<br/>
you to recite the same poetry in a public forum, such as the street<br/>
outside.  That&#39;s not private property.<br/>

Not true.  The Supreme Court has long upheld that private establishments<br/>
may<br/>
not refuse service to people on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, age,<br/>
or beliefs.  They have long ago expanded this to include exercise of one&#39;s<br/>
right of Free Speech. (The &quot;Fire!&quot; exclusion not included).<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions to this naturally.<br/>
<br/>
In one notable case in point in Florida, a man was refused service in a<br/>
prominent restaurant because he wrote a controversial column in a local<br/>
magazine.  The man sued the restaurant and lost, but was upheld on appeal<br/>
to<br/>
the federal district court of appeals on the basis of discrimination.  The<br/>
argument on the side of the restaurant was that having the man as a<br/>
customer<br/>
offended their other customers because they knew what he had written and<br/>
that writing offended them.  The court upheld that this was not sufficient<br/>
reason to bar him from an otherwise public place, nor to refuse him<br/>
service.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could remember the exact case from my law class but unfortunately<br/>
that was 12 years ago.<br/>
