&gt; <br/>
&gt; All the undead in unrest except Barbed bones (and higher)<br/>
&gt; are under level 20, which means they have green coward<br/>
&gt; code affecting them.  You could, at level 30, walk around<br/>
&gt; in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the undead<br/>
&gt; simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far<br/>
&gt; above them in level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING<br/>
&gt; the undead.  They still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which<br/>
<br/>

whether it worked or not.<br/>
<br/>
Except for ghouls and a couple other undead I don&#39;t recall at<br/>
the moment, coward code doesn&#39;t apply to undead.  All those<br/>
silly L5-10 skeletons and mummies still attack me at 49.  <br/>
That&#39;s actually one of the reasons necro pets were regarded as<br/>
better than mage pets early on - they wouldn&#39;t refuse to<br/>
attack something.<br/>
