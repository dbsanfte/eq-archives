<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919343787">Hmm, at 34 I would *not* wanna race either Grimfeather nor Shadowmen - even<br/>
with Mistmoore drum.  At 37, with MM drum, I am pretty sure I was beatin<br/>
Grim - never actually ran from Shadowmen.<br/>

p.s. at 35, down to less than a bub of hp and with Grim on my butt and<br/>
closing, one last desperate measure, siren song!  It stuck, /pet guard here,<br/>
selos&#39;d across the wood bridge to safety. whew, i did not want to die.<br/>

&gt; Yup, with a drum a bard can outrun just about anything in the game<br/>
starting<br/>
&gt; at around oh... level 5 ;)  As long as they aren&#39;t in the &quot;slowdown&quot; area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At level 34 I can outrun anything even with about 50hp if I have a drum<br/>
&gt; equipped. </span></blockquote></div>
