<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Bard Training in Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-980514258">What about those Bards that have saved up practice points and<br/>
  Gordon&#39;s answer of (paraphrased) &quot;We don&#39;t want people to become totally<br/>
  self-sufficient on the new continent&quot; screams of being a cop-out.  Other<br/>
  classes are, why can&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
  - I hope no one took this as a &quot;We are not being treated fair&quot; thread I<br/>
started.  I was just amazed to find all types of trainers there and yet only<br/>
a vendor for bards.  That&#39;s fine if they never ment them to be there in the<br/>
first place then why the hell don&#39;t they take them out.  Verant seems so<br/>
happy to fix &quot;other&quot; bugs that make life &quot;easier&quot; and yet the have made it<br/>
easy to never leave Kunark for some.....<br/>
<br/>
  I just find it a bit strange that they have not been taken out.... But<br/>
stranger yet.  If they wern&#39;t ment to be there then why such a vast &quot;city&quot;<br/>
of &quot;merchant&quot; type buildings????<br/>
