<div id="ygrps-yiv-993171890">No I spend a huge ammount of time invisible and I have noticed the opposite.<br/>
I have been seen on numerous occasions where I blink into view. Its scarin<br/>
the crap out of me. I was seen 3 times in less than an hour this morning in<br/>
Permafrost, fortunately I had my Jboots activated and had the speed to get<br/>
to the zone. My skill in Wind is 200, I maxed it a few days ago. I use invis<br/>
to navigate all sorts of places in upper and lower Guk, and Permafrost. I<br/>
always used to disband from my party just so I wouldnt have to worry about<br/>
my Invis fading on me because it was always 100% reliable before this last<br/>
patch. Now I dont know anymore, at least I know the caster Invis is going to<br/>
work a little while.<br/>

Did anyone else notice the &quot;you feel as if you are about to<br/>
become visible&quot; message with invisibility?  Of course Clouding<br/>
pulsed again before I became visible.  I have to wonder if<br/>
this fix (message 5 sec before invisibility blinks off) didn&#39;t<br/>
just make Clouding 100% reliable...<br/>
