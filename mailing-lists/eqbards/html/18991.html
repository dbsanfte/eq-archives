--------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
Greetings all! The following changes have been implemented on the Live<br/>
servers:<br/>
<br/>
*Spells/Songs*<br/>
<br/>
- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly<br/>
saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br/>
- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target<br/>
instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.<br/>
<br/>
*Items*<br/>
<br/>
The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its<br/>
weight decreased substantially.<br/>
<br/>
The Runed Fighter&#39;s Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has<br/>
been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this staff are much more<br/>
powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This change is retroactive and<br/>
will be reflected on items currently in inventory. Though we strive to avoid<br/>
negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented<br/>
a balance issue, making the change necessary. We apologize to warriors that<br/>
currently own this weapon.<br/>
<br/>
A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report &quot;Item out of<br/>
charges&quot;, has been corrected. Due to the dynamics of this particular issue,<br/>
current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new,<br/>
properly working version of the item.<br/>
<br/>
The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. In addition to an<br/>
increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect. The lightsource<br/>
effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be<br/>
&quot;sneaky&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
The effect on the Hangman&#39;s Noose will now work properly.<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.<br/>
They have been adjusted.<br/>
- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs and pets should<br/>
have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br/>
- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These<br/>
issues have been corrected.<br/>
- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance<br/>
of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune recipes should now work<br/>
correctly.<br/>
- Gorilla&#39;s in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly<br/>
reflects their undead status.<br/>
- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br/>
- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br/>
- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed<br/>
to start their character in Cabalis. They were never actually allowed to<br/>
create the character there, however the indication that they could has been<br/>
fixed.<br/>
- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in<br/>
certain cases.<br/>
<br/>
We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which<br/>
music does not currently work. There are 55 small files (around 2K each)<br/>
that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of<br/>
the affected zones.<br/>
<br/>
The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. Certain aspects of<br/>
the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the<br/>
reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to visit this zone and<br/>
search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on<br/>
Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience<br/>
being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). The affected zones<br/>
have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience<br/>
reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these<br/>
zones.<br/>
