<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272020578"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But this works both ways, I try not to tell strangers directly how to play<br/>
&gt; their characters. I bug my friends all the time and give them<br/>
&gt; pointers/advice, but it would be touchier with strangers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You got to understand, I&#39;m a man on a mission  8*)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve got to ding 50 before the year is out.  Sloppy gameplay,<br/>
  or lazy playing style doesnt just create more downtime, it<br/>
  gets people killed. (negative exp just plain hurts)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At your level, it sounds like any mistake could be quite fatal. At any<br/>
&gt; level, we all know how hard it can be to get together a real good group that<br/>
&gt; works like a well oiled machine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And they often are.  I know how the class masters do their thing.<br/>
  And it&#39;s very easy to pick out an inexperienced highlevel person <br/>
  playing in your group.  The bard is the group glue, we are designed<br/>
  to bring out the best in every class.  Thus, I have studied which<br/>
  classes do what best, and I know the little tricks and intricate<br/>
  details about each that make them strong.  In that way I provide<br/>
  more a leadership role.  Even in RL, I am a very opinionated yet<br/>
  strong team leader.  A bard most fits me (Ryan) as close as any<br/>
  of the other classes do.  Except in EQ, you&#39;ve got 12 yr olds<br/>
  (no offense) who have not understood responsibly nor delegation<br/>
  yet.  You have to be blunt with the kids, as they are.  My parents<br/>
  were very strict and straightforward with me, and I hated back then<br/>
  but I appreciate it much more now.  I am definitely a better person<br/>
  for it.  This is also the way I approach EQ, I dont attack people<br/>
  on a personal level, rather try to make them see their more full<br/>
  potential, gameplay wise.  If they resist, try to buck me, make<br/>
  me look bad, all it takes is one simple click on my client to<br/>
  make that headache go away.  I love input from my groups, in fact<br/>
  the first thing I ask is tell me the songs you want me to play<br/>
  and why.  But to have some ahole standing there saying I&#39;m Mr.<br/>
  Badass L50, and I have many L50 bards you should do X and Y<br/>
  because I say so, or I&#39;m outta here... later dude, good luck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But heck, this is all just a game. Isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, and when I get the groups I&#39;m in totally synched up<br/>
  that is the best feeling in the world.  A well oiled machine<br/>
  made of 6 different styles, 6 different personallities, 6 <br/>
  totally different people is an amazing accomplishment.  Yeah<br/>
  it&#39;s a game, but damn I love this game (and it&#39;s mechanics).<br/>
 <br/>
  I&#39;m definitely not a hard ass, usually people who stomp around<br/>
  and act like the know everything there is to know about EQ,<br/>
  or demand things be done a certain way less they pout will<br/>
  make a very low morale group.  I am a high energy, lots of<br/>
  alcohol, lots of jokes, lots of action, low downtime, big<br/>
  accomplishment respecting bard.  If I say, Player1 your <br/>
  spell is being cancelled by my song, please do X,Y,Z and see<br/>
  if that reduces your mana output and lessens our downtime.<br/>
  Or Player2 you are not casting enough X, please try to do<br/>
  that a little more and let me know how it works.  I never<br/>
  give a decent player an ultimatum, I always suggest or hint.<br/>
  I&#39;ve been with the best players this game has seen, and I<br/>
  can tell they know their stuff.  I learn from them and pass<br/>
  along the knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
  But you&#39;ll always get a jerk or two in your time, where you<br/>
  just gotta be as straightforward as possible.  That&#39;s the<br/>
  person I&#39;m referring to, when I say just Disband them.  8)<br/>
  Not the average player who needs a little advice.  ;)<br/>
  Conversely, I have never had to say anything to an enchanter,<br/>
  as I often end up learning a lot from them.<br/>
