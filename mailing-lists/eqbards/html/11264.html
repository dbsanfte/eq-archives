<div id="ygrps-yiv-801485780"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Pretty dumb is you ask me - same deal with this loot - damn good item for<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s and because they are weaker &#39;need&#39; these items more - sheesh.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m not a big loot freak.  That said, when I feel like I deserve<br/>
  something for my efforts, I will indeed speak up on my behalf.<br/>
<br/>
  However, you will find that while I don&#39;t have a Shield of the<br/>
  Slain Unicorn, or a Runed Mith Bracer, or a Mith BP - when it<br/>
  comes to randoming said items I will gladly not roll for they<br/>
  are things I have no use for.<br/>
<br/>
  I will never deprive another person of something they could<br/>
  take more advantage of on their character, rather than letting<br/>
  Harmonic take something he will maybe use or maybe put in the <br/>
  bank to collect dust until a uber trade comes along.<br/>
<br/>
  Would I bark if I wasnt included in the roll for such a belt?<br/>
  Probably.  Would it ruin my day?  No way.  If a person wanted<br/>
  it for a secondary or other toon not present in the raid, I<br/>
  would chuckle at them.  And I&#39;m sure everyone else would too.<br/>
  Dragon loot just doesn&#39;t work like that ;-)<br/>
