&gt;<br/>
&gt; The weapon delay check is probably done only once per<br/>
&gt; timeslice (0.1 seconds).  Since weapon delay is probably an<br/>
&gt; integer, that means a delay of zero would only get checked<br/>
&gt; once every 0.1 seconds, meaning it&#39;d work like a weapon with a<br/>
&gt; delay of 1.<br/>

weapon would be checked based on a 14 delay ;)</div>
