&gt;&gt; I am one happy bard tonight :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; Got my greaves and breastplate to go with everything else. Now all i need<br/>
&gt;&gt; is the arms and gloves and i got the visible set, course the other bard on<br/>
&gt;&gt; the server has the gloves and arms only....<br/>
&gt;&gt; We also killed more phobo&#39;s tonight and they dropped ANOTHER bracer on top<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the two from before. But they didnt drop any other bard armour.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So when are you guys going to spill the beans and give us the stats on each<br/>
&gt;piece of this bad boy armor! I want to have something to drool over while I<br/>
&gt;toil away killing the darkies in Mistmore.<br/>

not have so imagine you can go check it out soon at <br/>
www.gamesdb.net/everquest/. Or you can download bmps of me with screenshots<br/>
of everything but my bracers (which he already had) and the arms and<br/>
guantlets, which i do not have yet, at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip.">http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip.</a><br/>
