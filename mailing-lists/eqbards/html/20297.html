&gt; with 128 meg and a<br/>
&gt; 28000 modem. The only zones that were unhuntable were Unrest <br/>
&gt; and near the<br/>
&gt; Aviak City in SK (and Kunark before I lowered my clipping to <br/>
&gt; about1/3). 128<br/>
&gt; makes alll the difference :o)<br/>

what are the stats on the new PC...err, specs that is, if you don&#39;t mind my<br/>
asking. <br/>

Peace<br/>
Evulia, probably 3 months away from being able to afford a new PC</div>
