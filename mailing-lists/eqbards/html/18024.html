&gt; Actually Highkeep is notorious for attracting &quot;dumb players&quot; or rather it<br/>

&gt; The total safety of the hunting there causes people to learn terrible group<br/>
&gt; tactics (or not learn any at all).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 99% of the time if I find myself grouped with someone who levelled through<br/>
&gt; their upper 20&#39;s and lower 30&#39;s in highkeep I immediately leave the group.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not that ALL people who played there are bad, it&#39;s that most are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No offense to anyone who&#39;s hunted there religiously but HK just isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; same as SolA or GukTop or Cazic.<br/>
