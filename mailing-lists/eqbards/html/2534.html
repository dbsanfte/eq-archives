<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028609199">Heya Coot, I don&#39;t think Bob was &quot;whining&quot;, not in the least.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a few days to figure out a lot of the &quot;lingo&quot; EQ uses, and<br/>
there&#39;s still some that I am not sure of yet. Heck, some of the spell lists<br/>
in the strategy guide ALSO use quite a bit of lingo that just doesn&#39;t make<br/>
sense, or did not at one time. It&#39;s bad enough that a LOT of things have<br/>
absolutely NO descriptions or give any ideas of what they do. Using terms<br/>
that Verant can sit back and giggle about while the common player squints<br/>
his eyebrows and tilts his head wasn&#39;t a good idea, in my opinion, in<br/>
agreement with Bob&#39;s points.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see Bob threaten to quit the game or call anyone names, just making<br/>
a point about something he didn&#39;t like. No whining that I could tell.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 copper&#39;s worth,<br/>
