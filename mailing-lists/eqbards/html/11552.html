Can you explain what you mean here? The way I interpret it is that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter if you sing Elemental or Purifying Rhythm in regards to<br/>
resisting a disease/poison DOT because those spells check your magic resist<br/>
rate (which will be the same for both songs).   How were you able to<br/>
determine that poison/disease DOTs don&#39;t check your poison/disease resist<br/>
rate?  If they don&#39;t check your poison/disease resist rate, would that be<br/>
considered a bug or a &quot;feature&quot;?  This is also the first time I have ever<br/>
seen this even mentioned.  I was on vacation for two weeks and haven&#39;t had a<br/>
chance to read the recent archives so if this is a relatively new discovery<br/>
that would explain me missing it.<br/>
