<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078940527"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;And all these balance issues, while significant, don&#39;t take into account<br/>
&gt;twinking, which is the biggest unbalancing factor, I think. Of course, with<br/>
&gt;the scarcity of attainable items and the game bias against those of us who<br/>
&gt;prefer to solo, I can see why eBay sales are so brisk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Twinking is not nearly as unbalancing as most folks presume. How many times<br/>
have you seen someone in armor - with weapons WAY over their level -<br/>
running from an orc pawn - or screaming for help?<br/>
<br/>
Does it help at all?  Sure, some.  Does a lvl one in lvl 30 armor have that<br/>
much of an edge?  Nope, not really, not till their skills catch up - what<br/>
they usually have is a very well dressed corpse.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO - anyone that twinks under lvl 5 is just askin to lose a ton of stuff.<br/>
Be just my luck - I&#39;d die, the server would crash for about an hour - ouch.</div>
