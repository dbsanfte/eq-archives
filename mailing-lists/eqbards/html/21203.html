<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118499110">Sorry about that.  Obviously none of us knew that.  As far as why i said it,<br/>
partially was in a bad mood and partially because my impression of your<br/>
posts is that you only reply when you are disagreeing with someone, and seem<br/>
to always mention how long you&#39;ve been playing and that you were a guide.  i<br/>
like hearing your opinions, but sometimes you make them sound more fact that<br/>
what they really are.  Anyway you don&#39;t need to apologize, but i do, and i&#39;m<br/>
sorry.<br/>

&gt; comment by Shada<br/>
&gt; and Blitz Krieg just really hurt.  I hope you can understand. <br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; _just_ a game when real people&#39;s feelings are involved. </span></blockquote></div>
