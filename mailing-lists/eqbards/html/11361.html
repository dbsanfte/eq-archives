<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247347285"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my time on the<br/>
&gt; East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?  About what level are<br/>
&gt; they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would any bard over 27th ever want to pull just one of them? I<br/>
killed them today and was thinking &quot;This site was SPECIFICALLY designed<br/>
for a bord of 27+ to solo, how wonderful!&quot;<br/>
