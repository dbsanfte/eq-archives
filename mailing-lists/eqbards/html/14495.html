<div id="ygrps-yiv-37228005">Why would they?  No idea, but seeing those frog-like white things instantly<br/>
made me think of frogloks and seeing the dead one with yellow eyes only made<br/>
it more so.  Maybe the froggies and goblins had a war long ago?  Or the<br/>
froggies and kobolds?  Maybe that&#39;s how the undead frogloks got created and<br/>
that&#39;s why the live ones hate them?  I&#39;m just saying those white guys look<br/>
like frogs to me, and the yellow eyes just reinforced that impression.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I can answer some of this, and am surprised you didn&#39;t spot it too<br/>
&gt; with all the time you spend there.  The white critters are frogloks I<br/>

&gt; kobolds perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Why would the kobolds paint frogloks on their walls?  As far as I <br/>
  can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>
<br/>
  I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>
  But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.  If<br/>
  in fact it is Nagafen, it may not be.<br/>
