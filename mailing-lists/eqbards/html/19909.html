<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173688963">If you are agonistic or a worshipper of Bristlebane, and have never taken a <br/>
VentrilSavil faction hit, you should be fine. I was dubious to everybody in <br/>
the evil outpost(have since fought a bit in Karnor&#39;s) and was able to walk <br/>
past the guards in DE form. Us Bards are a rare breed -- we can activate <br/>
the Mask when on a boat, as soon as it zones in, while its moving or not.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve done(this was before they fixed the outpost to let Bristlebane <br/>
worshippers use it) is use Aria to go out, over the water and hop onto the <br/>
boat after it leaves the outpost. Could probably have done it before it <br/>
stopped, but I didn&#39;t trust the skels to leave me alone. You may want to <br/>
see about buying a levitate or two from a friendly caster and using that.<br/>

&gt;At some point I need to get to HHK to get the Aria.<br/>
