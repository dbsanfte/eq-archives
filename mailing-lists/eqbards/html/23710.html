&gt; &gt; i find the little taunt to be a bad thing.  i&#39;ll mez something for <br/>
&gt;3 minutes or so, in which time the shaman will malo and slow.  of <br/>
&gt;course when mez breaks it beelines the shaman instead of me, heh.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Damn lazy tanks. :p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d prefer a higher aggro on mez as well.  I can take the hits after <br/>
&gt;mez is broken, I&#39;d like the Shaman to stay medding. Of course, if the <br/>
&gt;Bard is mezzing and the Enchanter is Slowing rather than a Shaman, <br/>
&gt;then the Chanter will still be beat on.  I think it&#39;s easier to let <br/>
&gt;the Enchanter mez, so he can properly prep the mob for the break if <br/>
&gt;need be.  (mem blur)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm, speaking of memblur, i wonder what would happen if i threw a charm on<br/>
it after the malo and slow but long before the mez broke.<br/>
