&gt; &gt; Speaking of Song taunting...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Only thing I can figure is that somehow the code is messed up to the <br/>
&gt;point<br/>
&gt; &gt; that when a song pulses, the mobs consider it cast on everything within <br/>
&gt;its<br/>
&gt; &gt; radius, whether it has an effect or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Kitasi<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, I think this is exactly how it works.  With the (rare) exception <br/>
&gt;of the single-target songs,<br/>
&gt;everything we sing is AE.  This includes not just the AE damage songs, but <br/>
&gt;all party buff songs as well.<br/>
&gt;If a MOB is within the radius, they will notice.  This is why, when <br/>
&gt;fighting in, say, Cazic, you will get<br/>
&gt;a pile of lizards beating on you:  1) they wander towards the party, 2) <br/>
&gt;they enter your area of effect, 3)<br/>
&gt;unless someone did something to explicitly tick them off, you are now the <br/>
&gt;target.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually not so much messed up code as a poor patch job.  See till late in <br/>
Beta bard songs effect ALL PC/NPCs in the effect area, not just party <br/>
members.  I used to help groups all the time in Beta by standing near them & <br/>
healing/buffing with out being in their group.  Of course the funniest part <br/>
of this would be people that would &#39;hitch a ride&#39; on a passing bard and the <br/>
casters that would have their mediation interrupted by a passing bard :)<br/>
