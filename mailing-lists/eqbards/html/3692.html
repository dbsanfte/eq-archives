<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185469979">I usually respond to newbie begging by telling them that I&#39;ll give them lots<br/>
of help, as long as they aren&#39;t asking for money or equipment.  If they<br/>
respond that I&#39;m being a smartass, I tell them that although I really<br/>
dislike beggars, I&#39;m very free with any information they might need.  They<br/>
USUALLY end up thanking me.<br/>

&gt;      YES!,  It is very annoying.  I like to help out people within the<br/>
&gt;      confines of the game (locate body ect.) but Begging for money is a<br/>
&gt;      different case altogether.  I always ignore begging but it makes me<br/>
&gt;      feel guilty anyway. </span></blockquote></div>
