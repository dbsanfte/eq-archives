&gt; Does anyone know if the speedups from Anthem/Celerity <br/>
&gt; stack with the Quickness/Alacrity/Celerity line that enchanters<br/>
&gt; and shamans (the first 2) get?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On that same note, does Hymn stack with a shaman&#39;s<br/>
&gt; regeneration/chloroplast line?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I had Quickness/Alacrity cast on me, I could still use Anthem.  That<br/>
is I did not get the my song effect did not hold message.  Whether the<br/>
attack speed bonus was added on or I simply got the STR bonus, I do not<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Hymn stacks nicely with all the regeneration spells I&#39;ve run across (pack<br/>
regeneration from druids and some other kind of regeneration from<br/>
shamans).  From what I understand, both our heal song and other<br/>
regeneration spells are fix number added to target/group members&#39; natural<br/>
regeneration ability.  So all of them should stack with each other<br/>
(never have had 2 regeneration spells cast on me at the same time) and<br/>
the natural extra regeneration ability of a Troll is not rendered useless.</div>
