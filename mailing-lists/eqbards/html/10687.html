<div id="ygrps-yiv-865676113"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Chains does matter, I always keep it handy for emergency runner control.  <br/>
&gt; Remember our BIG advantage in snaring runners 1) We can &#39;cast&#39; while <br/>
&gt; running. 2) We can start it when the target is out of sight and only have to <br/>
&gt; be in sight when is finishes casting. 3)We NEVER are OOM. and 4) We can <br/>
&gt; &#39;cast&#39; while running.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Too many resists cause problems when fighting monster L40+, that is what<br/>
  I was referring to.  I&#39;d rather chain something, or try to chain <br/>
  something, then call for a snare before the monster runs.  Either<br/>
  way, chains are not as useful as they once were.  Chains interferes<br/>
  with shaman drowsy and enchanter slowdowns, for sure.  I let the <br/>
  casters slow and the ranger snare, since I have much more important<br/>
  things to twist.  (If someone does go on the run, yes running and<br/>
  casting is an awesome thing that people overlook frequently)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who cares about holding them? When I can interrupt the casting of froglok <br/>
&gt; wizard 90% of the time with a well placed pixie strike I am a happy camper.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Your 3 sec cast + 1 sec to even hit the button once you see the caster<br/>
  visual, is typically not enough time to sink an interrupt unless you<br/>
  devote yourself to pixie&#39;ing the mob forever, I&#39;d rather twist magic<br/>
  and something else.<br/>

&gt; listen to greedy casters that say play mana only unless you want to 8)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Since mana song is instant effect, and not pulse based, twisting<br/>
  it just hurts the effectiveness.  That said, I still do twist it<br/>
  in, but only after berserk and psalm are up.  Unless I have like<br/>
  a party of five wizards, hehehe.<br/>
