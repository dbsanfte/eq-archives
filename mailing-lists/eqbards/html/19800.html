<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928574578">Ok I missunderstood the first question:<br/>
<br/>
Bard Icons do not flash for the bard because their duration is shorter than<br/>
the flash warning period (ie: They&#39;d be flashing all the time.  Annoying to<br/>
say the least)<br/>
<br/>
However, there&#39;s a long standing bug/feature/whatever that IF you are<br/>
playing a song (heh are we ever NOT playing one?) then NONE of your icons<br/>
will flash.  Not sure if that&#39;s because the client can&#39;t tell which are bard<br/>
icons and which are not if one of ours is active.<br/>
<br/>
Either way.  If you have a song effect ACTIVE during the time that a spell<br/>
is wearing off it&#39;s icon won&#39;t flash.  If you are not playing a song (ie:<br/>
have no song effects active) your icons will flash before fading.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t played my bard since this thread came up, but I&#39;m absolutely<br/>
&gt; positive that both my cleric&#39;s and my shaman&#39;s icons flashed before<br/>
fading.<br/>
&gt; A warrior I was keeping buffs on even commented on it because when my<br/>
&gt; shaman&#39;s icons flashed I&#39;d rebuff him then me.  He thought I just had<br/>
&gt; amazing timing.  ;^)<br/>
