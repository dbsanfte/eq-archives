&gt;I don&#39;t tell other people how to play thier class and I don&#39;t like when<br/>
&gt;other people tell me how to play mine, especially when I play one of the<br/>
&gt;most difficult classes that requires the most thought. I usually inform them<br/>
&gt;that after 54 levels I know how to play my class.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>um, i&#39;m not saying this is you or anything but that line isn&#39;t the best defense for<br/>
being a good player.  i know plenty of 54+ bards who suck, and even more 54+ other<br/>
classes who suck.<br/>
