<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957335424">That&#39;s a nice list of the good and bad points of AC, and pretty much<br/>
matches up to my own personal list from the couple of months I played<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
AC is excellent for short games, for having a much more reasonable<br/>
penalty when you die, and for not making killstealing (relatively<br/>
speaking) an issue.<br/>
<br/>
But, while EQ&#39;s zones are a pain in the rear, they do give each place<br/>
in the world a distinct feel.  When I travel in EQ and see somewhere<br/>
for the first time, I mostly think &quot;Oooooooh&quot;.  When I travel in AC<br/>
and see somewhere for the first time I mostly think &quot;Oh&quot;.  Hopefully<br/>
that will get the idea across ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I enjoyed AC for giving me a large number of outdoor areas<br/>
that I can wander around in and fight things, without the need to camp<br/>
spawns and fight/argue with the idiots who spoiled my EQ fun<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I&#39;ve just cancelled my AC subscription because I had<br/>
no desire to go back and play it!!  Fickle?  Me?  Not likely ;-)<br/>

&gt;Things I liked about AC:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Totally customizable characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher you <br/>
&gt;go if the critter is low level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The ability to solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Things I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The interface<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The chat system<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-The graphics<br/>
&gt;<br/>
