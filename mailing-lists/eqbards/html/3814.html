<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817096882">And I am the exact opposite. In UO - all I WAS was a craftsman, and I loved<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rather disappointed that the trades are so lacking in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
No one is forcing ANYONE to be a craftsman, but it&#39;s a nice switch if<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
I like being a craftsman primarily because of the interpersonal interaction<br/>
it affords dealing with customers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent the last week working on various craft skills - I really could<br/>
care less when I get my next level - I&#39;m not in a race with anyone. I&#39;m<br/>
strong enough to walk thru my own homelands pretty much unmolested - that<br/>
was my endgoal on leveling.<br/>
<br/>
As tedious as tradeskills are in EQ - I really, really don&#39;t see a problem<br/>
with someone willing to devote that much time earning a few plat - since<br/>
99% (soon to be 100% I fear) of them are money loosing propositions, and<br/>
most goods aren&#39;t needed by players at all.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make you craft - why do some folks think I should HAVE to bash<br/>
monsters - or I am &#39;wasting&#39; my time not leveling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I WILL level eventually, just in no particular hurry to do so.<br/>

&gt;Trade skills is what some people want in an MMORPG.  That is why I like EQ,<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have to deal with trade skills to make money - I work enough in RL,<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to play a game and work there too.  In all of my years of<br/>
&gt;roleplaying (AD&D, Amber, etc) I don&#39;t ever remembering anyone saying &#39;I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t want to go out and explore and kill stuff, I would rather make armor<br/>
&gt;or jewelry!&#39;  That is what NPC&#39;s did for you.  <br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Most people don&#39;t realize it, but a lot of the enjoyment of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social<br/>
&gt;&gt; aspect<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think EQ has enough infrastructure to survive on a<br/>
&gt;&gt; purely social aspect.  There are no player-owned structures,<br/>
&gt;&gt; there are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>
&gt;&gt; most of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>
&gt;&gt; just before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; much you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>
&gt;&gt; monsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>
&gt;&gt; your mark on the world.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>
&gt;&gt; possibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>
&gt;&gt; much different from an IRC chat room.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; In that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>
&gt;&gt; to make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>
&gt;&gt; strived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>
&gt;&gt; Brad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>
&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>
&gt;&gt; that long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>
&gt;&gt; persistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>
&gt;&gt; thus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>
