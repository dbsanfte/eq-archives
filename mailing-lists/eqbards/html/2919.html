<div id="ygrps-yiv-80018037">There is a better way to do this!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I lost a Mino Axe at lvl 9 and destroyed a Combine LS before perfecting<br/>
my juggle<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 methods that work - in battle and out of battle<br/>
<br/>
When out of battle I switch to inventory, then pick up the item from my<br/>
hand.  Drop it on an open inventory spot or switch with the item I<br/>
want.   AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.<br/>
I drop the new item I want to hold - ON THE PICTURE!!!<br/>
It will drop into the melee hand automatically.  you do not have to<br/>
place it in the little melee box.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend turning on off the quick destroy option though - see above.<br/>
 One time I dropped a little too fast and clicked the destroy button. <br/>
OUCH!!! <br/>
<br/>
When in battle I set up one page of quick buttons to be inventory and<br/>
melee spots<br/>
a quick Shift 2 - and the melee and open inventory spots are all right<br/>
there close to each other - switching is fast<br/>
Then Shift 1 back to my bank of song quick buttons<br/>
<br/>
Warning - you can still drop items if you miss these boxes, but its<br/>
harder to do that than dropping from your inventory screen.  <br/>
<br/>
This is much faster than going to inventory and moving the mouse as<br/>
much as you need to for the juggle.<br/>
