&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: Bards vs Clerics in melee<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The mere fact that there would be a MAJOR UPROAR makes it obvious that<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; being able to bind is a far more serious detriment than you would have<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe.  Binding is bar-none the most powerful ability in the game,<br/>
&gt; period.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is no ability that makes up for it nor any package of abilities<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; does so balance-wise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are correct.  That is why that Bards alone cannot get this spell.  It<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be fair for every other class if Bards got &quot;the most powerful<br/>
&gt; ability in the game&quot;.  If you would have read my note instead of just<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to flame me, you would have saw that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can pull a hundred reasons out of your ass as to why Bards should have<br/>
&gt; Bind and it won&#39;t make one bit of difference.  Bards are not going to get<br/>
&gt; Bind.  Instead of beating your head against a brick wall, you should be<br/>
&gt; asking for something that might have a chance of being implemented.  Ask<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; the capability to be bound anywhere (or just at Inns) by a caster AND the<br/>
&gt; ability to be bound in cities by NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.  Clerics and Shamans are hybrids<br/>
&gt; &gt; plain and simple.  Both can melee effectively at some levels and sit<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cast at other levels.  Pure casters are never effective at melee.<br/>
&gt; There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are four Pure caster classes in this game.  Magician, Enchanter, Wizard,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Necromancer.  Clerics, Druids and Shamans are hybrids that lean heavily<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster.  Shadowknights, Rangers, and Paladins are hybrids that lean<br/>
&gt; heavily<br/>
&gt; &gt; towards melee.  Balance would suggest that Bards are hybrids that lean<br/>
&gt; &gt; neither way.  We get the worst of both worlds for the most part.  The<br/>
&gt; lousy<br/>
&gt; &gt; defensive skills of the caster hybrids and the lousy offensive spells of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee hybrids.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It takes a particular type of person to have fun playing a bard.  Bards<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be fun to play, no doubt about it, but those who find them so, myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; included, would have fun playing a bard no matter what the abilities<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; just because that&#39;s the type of people we are.  I&#39;d just like to be able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have as much fun playing the class I am most attracted to as my friends<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing the class they are most attracted to.  Right now, character<br/>
&gt; &gt; balance-wise, that ain&#39;t happenin&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh and the Identify spell isn&#39;t the only spell those pure casters get at<br/>
&gt; &gt; that level is it?  In fact it isnt even one of 4 per level group but<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; like 1 of 8 or ten.  also our 12th level DD does 7 points of damage max.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yeah we can cast it a lot if we don&#39;t cast anything else since none of<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells have the 45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you just a stupid ass fuck?  I am so sick and tired of all these<br/>
&gt; crybabies who has raised up one character to level 12 and thinks their<br/>
class<br/>
&gt; is underpowered.  All your facts are so screwed up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - &quot;12th level DD does 7 points of damage max&quot;  WRONG.  Every two levels it<br/>
&gt; does an extra point of damage.<br/>
&gt; - &quot;45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.&quot;  WRONG.  None of the low-medium<br/>
&gt; Cleric spells last that long.  Maybe at 40+....<br/>
&gt; - &quot;The lousy defensive skills of the caster hybrids&quot;  WRONG.  Bard&#39;s<br/>
Defense<br/>
&gt; caps at 5/level instead of 4/level for Clerics.  Bards have the same<br/>
&gt; defensive ability of Rangers and Paladins until level 17-18 (where Rangers<br/>
&gt; and Paladins get Parry).<br/>
&gt;  - &quot;lousy offensive spells of the melee hybrids.&quot; WRONG.  Paladins can<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; affect Undeads.  And if you stop and restart Bellow, you can get many more<br/>
&gt; magical attacks than a Paladin and Ranger could ever hope to get off.  And<br/>
&gt; correct me if I am wrong, I thought that the hybrids stop attacking while<br/>
&gt; they were casting (or maybe their animation doesn&#39;t show it).  Plus Bards<br/>
&gt; never run out of mana.<br/>
&gt; - &quot;To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.&quot;  WRONG.  I never called<br/>
Clerics<br/>
&gt; pure casters.<br/>
