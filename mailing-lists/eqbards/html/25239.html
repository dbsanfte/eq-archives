<b>Subject:</b> Off-Topic - Virus Warning!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-447313348">Not 20 minutes after I got this warning in my own box, I got the virus sent <br/>
to me by god-knows-whom.  Please follow all traditional safety precautions.<br/>
<br/>
Details follow:<br/>
Security experts warned Friday of a fast-spreading new worm that could <br/>
delete files and fill up the hard drives of infected computers.<br/>
<br/>
The worm, &quot;W32.Sircam&quot; or &quot;SirCam,&quot; arrives attached to an e-mail message <br/>
with a randomly chosen subject line, according to a report prepared by the <br/>
AntiVirus Research Center of software maker Symantec. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@...)">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@...)</a><br/>
<br/>
Virus Characteristics:<br/>
This mass-mailing virus attempts to send itself and local documents to all <br/>
users found in the Windows Address Book and email addresses found in <br/>
temporary Internet cached files (web browser cache).<br/>
<br/>
It may be received in an email message containing the following information:<br/>
Subject: [filename (random)]<br/>
Body: Hi! How are you?<br/>
I send you this file in order to have your advice<br/>
or I hope you can help me with this file that I send<br/>
or I hope you like the file that I sendo you<br/>
or This is the file with the information that you ask for<br/>
<br/>
See you later. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
--- the same message may be received in Spanish ---<br/>

Attached will be a document with a double extension (the filename varies). <br/>
The first extension will be the file type which was prepended by the virus. <br/>
When run, the document will be saved to the C:&#92;RECYCLED folder and then <br/>
opened while the virus copies itself to C:&#92;RECYCLED&#92;SirC32.exe folder to <br/>
conceal its presence and creates the following registry key value to load <br/>
itself whenever .EXE files are executed:<br/>
HKCR&#92;exefile&#92;shell&#92;open&#92;command<br/>
&#92;Default=&quot;C:&#92;recycled&#92;SirC32.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*<br/>
As the RECYCLE BIN is often on the exclusion list, check your settings to <br/>
insure that this directory IS being scanned.<br/>
It also copies itself to the WINDOWS SYSTEM directory as SCam32.exe and <br/>
creates the following registry key value to load itself automatically:<br/>
HKLM&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;<br/>
RunServices&#92;Driver32=C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM&#92;SCam32.exe<br/>
<br/>
A list of .GIF, .JPG, .JPEG, .MPEG, .MOV, .MPG, .PDF, .PNG, .PS, and .ZIP <br/>
files in the MY DOCUMENTS folder is saved to the file SCD.DLL (the 2nd <br/>
character of the name appears to be random) in the SYSTEM directory. Email <br/>
addresses are gathered from the Windows Address Book and temporary Internet <br/>
cached pages and saved to the file SCD1.DLL (the 2nd and 3rd character of <br/>
the name appears to be random) in the SYSTEM directory.<br/>
<br/>
The worm prepends a copy of the files that are named in the SCD.DLL file <br/>
and attaches this copy to the email messages that it sends via a built in <br/>
SMTP server, using one of the following extensions: .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .LNK, <br/>
.PIF. This results in attachment names having double-extensions.<br/>
The program creates a registry key to store variables for itself (such as a <br/>
run count, and SMTP information):<br/>
HKLM&#92;Software&#92;Sircam<br/>
<br/>
To remove the worm:<br/>
1. Run LiveUpdate to make sure that you have the most recent virus <br/>
definitions.<br/>
2. Start Norton AntiVirus (NAV), and run a full system scan, making sure <br/>
that NAV is set to scan all files.<br/>
3. Delete any files detected as W32.Sircam.Worm@mm.]<br/>
