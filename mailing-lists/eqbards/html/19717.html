<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994388087">Several people have asked what others thought would be a good effect for <br/>
singing steel (other than the drek we already know about).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, gate would be nice.  I hate that moment at the end of a raid where I&#39;m <br/>
desparately counting...&quot;how many melee left and how many wizards/druids???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what we could really use:  A Charisma buff.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors get a str buff.  If we&#39;re grouped with an enchanter who can buff <br/>
us, our charisma is less relavant (though not irrelevant), but if there&#39;s no <br/>
chanter or shaman around... well, it&#39;d be nice.<br/>
