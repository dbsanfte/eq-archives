<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427533817">In addition to my main character which of course is a bard, I also have a<br/>
level 20 druid and a level 10 ranger.  I can tell you that their tracking<br/>
in general is great but is quite fustrating as well to use.  Especially<br/>
the Druid&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The other night my druid was in North Karana and I was using tracking to<br/>
locate a PC friend.  At the same time I was watching out for GrimFeather<br/>
who had already digested me earlier.  I almost ran straight into him<br/>
because he did not show up on tracking.  I was VERY near him and hit<br/>
tracking at least four or five times before finally accepting the fact<br/>
that he was not going to show up on it.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, I was close to the South Karana zone so of course tracking<br/>
was picking up a lot of PCs that were at the zone.  However, it seems to<br/>
me saying one class&#39; tracking is better than the others is not very<br/>
accurate.  A rangers tracking would have picked up GrimFeather well before<br/>
he got near the zone so the PC clutter would not have shown up.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution for tracking is to simply add a scroll bar.  While<br/>
filtering would be great and preferred by myself, it would seem that the<br/>
easiest method to solve the problem with be to add a scroll bar to the<br/>
tracking window.  If that were to happen, then rangers would have the best<br/>
tracking as they should.  Of course bards would be second then too. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that dog<br/>
&gt; &gt;that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Druids get track at 20.  They get to put one practice point into it, and <br/>
&gt; there it stays, never improving.  Yet it IS useful, sometimes even more <br/>
&gt; useful than high level ranger tracking. This is because the druid tracks <br/>
&gt; what is nearby, the ranger tracks what is on the other side of the zone.  <br/>
&gt; Many times I&#39;ve had rangers tell me high level tracking sucks.  In this one <br/>
&gt; instance, maybe bards got the best deal of all - mid range tracking. :)<br/>
