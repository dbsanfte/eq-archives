<b>Subject:</b> Request for advice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951223832">I am approaching 10th level and find myself having to make a decision to<br/>
which I request some advice from higher experienced bards.<br/>
<br/>
My current situation is this:<br/>
1)  I fight with either a tarnished long sword or tarnished rapier.  I have<br/>
max ability in both for my current level.  <br/>
2)  I wear a combination of patchwork and leather armor.  My tunic and<br/>
leggings are patchwork.  Most of everything else is leather.  My AC is<br/>
around 220 with buffs.<br/>
3)  I do not dabble in any of the trades.  I will start brewing once I am<br/>
able to get my hands on brewing supplies.  Currently, the only place to buy<br/>
brewing supplies is on the Antonica continent.  I have no intentions of<br/>
smithing or tailoring to make money.  As a result....<br/>
4)  I only have about 8 PPs saved up.<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is what should be my next major purchase.  When I make 10th<br/>
level, I know I need to go to Freeport to purchase the Anthem de Arms song.<br/>
Not certain how much this will cost me but I&#39;m not going to make a major<br/>
purchase until I buy that song first.  With the money I have left over, I<br/>
need to either buy better armor or a better weapon.  <br/>
<br/>
If I buy armor, should I wait until I have enough money to buy a banded<br/>
tunic or should I buy a leather tunic, which is cheaper.  How much better is<br/>
banded over leather?  Currently, orc legionnaires pound the crap out of me.<br/>
Will leather make much of difference over patchwork?<br/>
<br/>
Should I hold off on buying a weapon and instead focus on looting one off of<br/>
a monster?  At 10th level I should be able to survive long enough (with a<br/>
group) in the Mino caves to get a Minotaur axe.  Does anyone have a<br/>
suggestion of another place to go to get a better weapon than tarnished?<br/>
Ideally, I would like to use Crookstinger&#39;s stinger (a magic piercing<br/>
weapon) if I can get it.  Don&#39;t know if my group would be even strong (or<br/>
lucky) enough to defeat Crookstinger (a NPC wasp).  Does anyone have an idea<br/>
where in Lesser Faydark Crookstinger appears?  I have never seen him<br/>
personally nor I have ever heard of anyone fighting him.  I saw a post about<br/>
him on another board so thats how I heard about him.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time for any response.<br/>
