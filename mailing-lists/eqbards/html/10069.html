<b>Subject:</b> getting Lambent armor bracers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091025810">Just in case some bards are wondering about the quests, here&#39;s my<br/>
experience getting Lambent bracers:<br/>
<br/>
	While i was level 28 decided to try for these, afterall, Griffennes<br/>
conned even to me! So i got 2 level 30 rangers to help me and we went to<br/>
NK. First thing: Griffennes are rare. in 3 hours of hunting we only<br/>
found 3. It was every thing the 3 of us could do to kill the griffenne.<br/>
It nearly killed all 3 of us each time. 3 kills: no charm.<br/>
<br/>
	Came back the next day without the rangers, with a 25th druid, i was<br/>
29th then. the Griffennes that conned blue to me were a piece of cake. I<br/>
could chain them while the druid DOT&#39;d them, 2 kills, one charm. <br/>
<br/>
	Went to unrest to get bracelet, walked in there is a corpse on floor...<br/>
hrmm a Greater dark boned skel... yep, it has the bracelet on it. well,<br/>
that was easy.<br/>
<br/>
	Got my bracer and went back to NK, killed 2 griffennes with a shaman<br/>
(they drop an item for the shaman quest also), we got 2 feathers for<br/>
him, no charm for me. Then someone yelled &quot;free charm at stone bridge&quot;.<br/>
I ran and i got it.<br/>
<br/>
	Back to unrest for bracelet, luckily we were having a guild event and<br/>
we took over the pit. Got my bracelet from my own kill in about 15<br/>
minutes. In 2 more hours of event, saw about 3 more bracelets, shouted<br/>
for bards to come get, noone ever did.<br/>
<br/>
	So if you want to do the quests yourself... i&#39;d say you need to be 28+<br/>
or have a great group helping you. I wanted to do the quests myself, but<br/>
could not pass up free items like this.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
