<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s that time again, I&#39;ve made it to the dizzy heights of 18,<br/>
and like all good bards I want to practice my new song to perfection.<br/>
And I would .... if I could only get the damn thing started.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my question is simply this ... what instrument should I be<br/>
using for this Discord thing.  I&#39;ve tried a horn, but that didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to do much for me.  And I can&#39;t find anything else that looks like<br/>
it&#39;s vaguely brass.  Been through all the guilds and nothing.  Where<br/>
oh where is that shiny new instrument I&#39;ve been waiting all my life<br/>
for!?<br/>
<br/>
Yours in desperation to dazzle the audience with new songs<br/>
