<div id="ygrps-yiv-636205680">Hail, tis I Gleeman the Roving Bard of Karana server!  I am now in my 14th<br/>
level and feeling darn proud about myself<br/>
<br/>
A person I met in Qeynos told me about the mailing list so I thought I would<br/>
check it out.<br/>
<br/>
and from the archived Messages I have read so far, this mailing list proves<br/>
to be an excellent source of Bard information<br/>
<br/>
Little did I know that peircing was such an important skill for Bard&#39;s  I<br/>
must pick up a Dragoon Dirk on my next trip to Crushbone<br/>
<br/>
for all of you people complaining about some of the dungeons being<br/>
incredibly over camped, Go to Permafrost!!<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost is one of the only zones in the game that will be sometimes<br/>
deserted in EQ&#39;s peak hours, there are all sorts of mobs in there ranging<br/>
from level 15-Lady Vox, and the loot is mainly Medium Bronze armor which can<br/>
be found on any level goblin, but more often on the higher ones.   Be warned<br/>
about this zone though as the Goblins are very tough for their levels and<br/>
can easily topple a group.<br/>
<br/>
but here are some of my questions:<br/>
What are some good strength raising Items a level 14 Bard can obtain?? I am<br/>
pursuing the purchase of a set of &quot;veiwable&quot; Bronze Armor (so far I have the<br/>
plate, helm, bracers) and the weight can be crippling as I only placed 85<br/>
strength when I started my character,  Items that raise strength I have so<br/>
far are: Silver Amber rings and a spiked collar this brings my strength up<br/>
to 89 but I am always quite near encumbered and if I wish to carry any Loot<br/>
with me I have to suffer a loss of speed and agility.  I know things like<br/>
the bloodstained mantle and tunic raise strength, as well as the &quot;Thick<br/>
Banded Belt&quot; found in Guk (as I have read on EQ&#39;Lizer)  currently I have<br/>
around 50plat in the bank, and was wondering if I could afford any of these<br/>
things<br/>
<br/>
Should I start using the Dragoon dirk as my primary weapon to gain peirce<br/>
skill or should I invest in a FS rapier instead??<br/>
<br/>
Where should a person of my level be fighting? I don&#39;t really care about<br/>
where it is on the world as travel is quite easy for me ).  BlackBurrow is<br/>
becoming quite boring, I found Crushbone to be overcamped and not really<br/>
worthwhile.  Are places like dagnor&#39;s cauldron or Lavastorm safe for me??<br/>
<br/>
and lastly  what are some really good &quot;weaving, juggling, twisting, or<br/>
medlying&quot; methods??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. can anyone send me a copy of that list of Bard song&#39;s that has the<br/>
locations, and uses<br/>
<br/>
Gleeman, the roving bard<br/>
who&#39;s big mouth has landed him in trouble more often than not</div>
