&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been using instll doubt and actually had it work a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; times.  Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>
&gt; &gt; doubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>
&gt; &gt; standard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; point of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; working).  Huh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wow, I am REALLY impressed.  I have pressed this button hundreds of times...<br/>
&gt; maybe thousands, and NEVER had it work.  I *have* experienced the kick thing<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>

snared, another when it wasn&#39;t and my party rightfully berated<br/>
me for scaring off the mob), and once on that dark elf.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t work often, but it does work.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have yet to succeed at it, as my skill is only 1.  :-)  I<br/>
did get that 1 point on a failure, so skill gain does not seem<br/>
to be success-based.  I just thought some of the NPC behavior<br/>
I&#39;d seen after begging was odd.  Hmm, I have 104 skill points<br/>
sitting unused.  Maybe I&#39;ll dump some into begging...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe that sneak works for other classes (monk and bard) but only rogues<br/>
&gt; get the success and failure messages associated with it.  Given the bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; very low sneak scores, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re just failing your sneak all<br/>
&gt; the time, rather than the skill not working.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I was succeeding.  I tested it by seeing how slowly I was<br/>
moving.  I&#39;m curious how they&#39;ve implemented it if it&#39;s not<br/>
based on factions.  Maybe it&#39;s based on aggro radius?<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I should check is if we can do the hide-sneak<br/>
combo that rogues get.  I&#39;ve heard only rogues can do this,<br/>
but I have to wonder if people just say that because only<br/>
rogues have a high enough hide/sneak cap to pull it off<br/>
consistently.  (If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, if a<br/>
rogue successfully hides, then successfully sneaks, he can<br/>
move while hidden.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, playing around with these useless skills does make<br/>
time on the boat pass more quickly.<br/>
