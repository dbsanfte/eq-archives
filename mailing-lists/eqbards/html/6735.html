Playing in Najena at lunch.  I am a level 26 bard.  I&#39;ve been getting in<br/>
the habit of going down to the guards area and breaking up the spawn in the<br/>
outer guard room, and killing the two guards, and one officer there solo<br/>
(no one there ever wants to party with me at the times I&#39;m there).  So, I<br/>
do my typical tactic using lament, and eventually pull the guard officer by<br/>
himself.  So I&#39;m fighting and he&#39;s pounding on me pretty good (I think<br/>
they&#39;re in the level 24-25 range), and I&#39;m using my typical round of songs:<br/>
 Warsong, Chain, Discord.  Well, 8 chain resists, and 6 discord resists<br/>
later, I had to fire up screech to get out of dodge.  2 screech resists,<br/>
and 3 chain resists later, I limped out of the zone with less than half a<br/>
bubble left, the officer still had greather than 60% health.  I have taken<br/>
the officers solo serveral times in the past.  I hope this was just the<br/>
evil random number generator and not a sign of more nerfing of resist rates<br/>
for songs.  I never ONCE got him to be affected by Discord.  On the<br/>
brighter side, I never once resisted my own warsong.  heh.  :)<br/>
