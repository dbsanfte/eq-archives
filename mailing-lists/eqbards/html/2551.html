<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002182758">Thanks for your submissions to the EQ Glossary.  Normally, I prefer to<br/>
receive these privately, but since you asked publically (and since a few<br/>
others have asked):<br/>
<br/>
re: Mules/Twinking:  During Beta, Muling and Twinking were not approved (as<br/>
I understand it).  Since no statement ever came out changing that status, I<br/>
naturally assumed that it was still the same when I began playing.  A GM I<br/>
questioned about it shortly after I started confirmed it for me (I wasn&#39;t<br/>
playing during Beta, just reading the boards), however, since then, several<br/>
people have commented that it is not true.  Mules and Twinking, while not<br/>
specifically approved, will not get the character(s) deleted.  Well,<br/>
basically, I left the comments in the Glossary in the vain hope that some<br/>
newbies might be too afraid to try it, thinking their characters might be<br/>
deleted.  Since it now appears that nothing will halt, or even slow the<br/>
onslaught of powergaming, I have decided to delete the references.  It is<br/>
apparent that Verant not only approves of powergaming, they thoroughly<br/>
encourage it, leaving the slower or more roleplaying among us to twiddle<br/>
our thumbs in the dust.<br/>
