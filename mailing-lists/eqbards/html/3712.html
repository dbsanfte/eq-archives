<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900938076">Just last night - I went from 0 to 135 brewing (anyone know of a way or<br/>
something to get it higher)?<br/>
<br/>
I think I MIGHT break even on fierce brew - was mainly working on the skill<br/>
- not worried too much about actually making money at it.<br/>
<br/>
I have done a bit of pottery - and you CAN make good money at it - it&#39;s<br/>
tedious, boring as hell - but hey - if you are trying to save up and get a<br/>
nestegg - I can do tedious for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Since there is so very little PC NEED for most crafted items - NPCs should<br/>
at LEAST offer you breakeven prices - preferable a LITTLE profit on them.<br/>
<br/>
If I can stand and do this hours on end (most won&#39;t) why shouldn&#39;t I have<br/>
that option?<br/>
<br/>
I one thing I DON&#39;T like about EQ - you HAVE to be a monster slayer.  In<br/>
another game - I mastered every craft there was - and was quite a<br/>
proficient merchant. I LIKE being a craftsman and merchant.<br/>

&gt;Ok, I see your point.  Fierce Brewing was somewhat ridiculous, I agree, but<br/>
&gt;at least it offset my expenses.  It actually -costs- me money to be a brewer<br/>
&gt;now, quite a bit since I experiment and have a lot of waste.  No<br/>
&gt;experimenting, with failures at master level, I&#39;ll end up actually spending<br/>
&gt;more to make the highest skill or lowest skill drinks than what I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;actually get back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fine, then I should sell to players, lets assume there was an actual demand.<br/>
&gt;Well, a player can buy the cheapest drink from an NPC bartender over a PC<br/>
&gt;Brewer, paying 3 times less, or even more if the PC actually wanted to make<br/>
&gt;a slight profit!  Most brewers give their wares away free, regardless,<br/>
&gt;really making this truely an expensive hobby, a hobby, not a trade.  With<br/>
&gt;Fierce Brewing, was nice because I could give away drinks, experiment, and<br/>
&gt;at least break even.  Was nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s all philosophy I suppose.  Some think that the only way one should<br/>
&gt;advance in any way whatsoever is through killing, rinse, killing.  Quests,<br/>
&gt;diversion.  Trades, diversion.  I think it would make the world much more<br/>
&gt;diverse if every member of society didn&#39;t have to play the part of the<br/>
&gt;ultimate hero.<br/>

&gt;and sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>
&gt;getting drunk anyway.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Sorry for the off-topic rant, I guess I&#39;m just tired of<br/>
&gt;&gt;people over on the pottery list whining about V nerfing<br/>
&gt;&gt;trade skills.  We were never meant to make steady<br/>
&gt;&gt;plats selling created goods to vendors.  Clicking a mouse<br/>
&gt;&gt;for hours on end, with no player interaction, no exploring,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and no risk are not in Verant&#39;s vision for the game.<br/>
