<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781088489">Heh, first of all this makes me glad I am not in an UberGuild (which of<br/>
course means our guild won&#39;t be taking on dragons anytime soon). Secondly I<br/>
*love* a good active reply like a clearly stated class boycott. Less whiney<br/>
than a petition, more mature than screaming, more likely to change the<br/>
status quo than quitting. Keep a positive, mature attitude and a steel<br/>
resolve and a lot can happen. I hope it goes well for you.<br/>
