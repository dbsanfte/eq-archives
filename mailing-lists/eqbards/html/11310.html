<b>Subject:</b> RE: Use for Lullaby at L17... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-737691815">I tried it all three ways last night, twisting, pulsing, and continuous.<br/>
Didn&#39;t matter.  It would often take three or four successful nods to<br/>
actually affect the target.  Spell interruption seemed better maybe 75%.<br/>
Seems a lot like another double resist problem except that it happens too<br/>
often.  I actually had more trouble lulling greens and low blues than I did<br/>
high blues and whites.  The numbers weren&#39;t a lot different, but the % was<br/>
higher.  I tried on 35 different mobs and used about 400 nod messages in the<br/>
log file.  53% of the time the mob attacked freely right after nodding.<br/>
I also tried with and without the lute.  That didn&#39;t matter either.  Resists<br/>
were affected, blue dangerous resisted me 15% without lute and 9% with lute.<br/>
Successful Nods that had no effect were the same though relatively at 53%<br/>
and 52%.  The lower was actually without lute.  It&#39;s very possible they<br/>
changed it without telling us.  Of course what they have changed it too<br/>
makes it too dangerous to use.  I tried using it when we got stuck with 4<br/>
greater skeletons, knowing it might activate the 3 other green ones nearby.<br/>
Unfortunately we all had to zone because despite 7 successful nods, not a<br/>
single one of the skeletons ceased attacking.  It had the same effect later<br/>
on reavers, we got a bad pull with 3 undead and 2 regular.  Not one of them<br/>
ceased attacking even though they all nodded.  On about the third pulse I<br/>
had them down to three attacking despite the fact that only one person was<br/>
attacking then so for sure hitting only one target.  Not me, I had my lute<br/>
out.  Again we had to zone to avoid getting squished.  Whether a purposeful<br/>
nerf, an unforeseen change, or an outright bug, getting Verant to notice<br/>
seems to be the tricky part.  Maybe if I can figure out a way to get free xp<br/>
out of it they&#39;ll look at it.<br/>

Yes, I know John, we play on the same server and met back in the low 20s<br/>
in Unrest. He is one of the best bards on the server hands down in my<br/>
opinion. I always love his tests because they are thorough and<br/>
informative. :)<br/>
<br/>
Could Verant have secretly sneaked in a fix to Lullaby on us? I have<br/>
read Lullaby, like Charm, is CHA intensive for resist checks. Last night<br/>
we did it again, fighting L19-20 aviak guards at the &quot;Fire Tower&quot; in<br/>
Lake Rathetear. A L17 Cleric, L18 Bard, and L20 Shaman. All three guards<br/>
were spawned and we had to split them, 2 L19&#39;s and a L20. The L20<br/>
appeared to resist it heavily, the 2 L19s snored through the entire<br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
What else might make the difference? Songs check Dex too, based on a<br/>
message I read a bit ago (I cannot confirm the source or orginal poster<br/>
unfortunately). I&#39;m not sure why we have been so lucky with Lullaby. As<br/>
I said previously, I&#39;ve also used it with &#39;stunning&#39; success on my own<br/>
bard, those NPC clerics I could never hope to kill now can never get a<br/>
heal or wrath off, and after they hit 50% it&#39;s all over since they are<br/>
chained and feared. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else been able to get Lullaby to work effectively enough to keep<br/>
it memm&#39;d? Are people twisting it, manually pulsing it, or letting it<br/>
play on it on? When I use it to interrupt casters, it has been manually<br/>
pulsing it, twisting will not keep the targets asleep without an<br/>
instrument from what I&#39;ve seen. <br/>
