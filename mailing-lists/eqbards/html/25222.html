 </span></blockquote>i think you should update neck, head, rings, bracers, breastplate, greaves,<br/>
waist<br/>
<br/>
neck: crafted stuff maybe, cha, str, resists, whatever. or buy/camp white<br/>
gold necklace (noble in guk)<br/>
<br/>
head: imbrued helm is quite good, best cha item is kobold jesters crown<br/>
(ac15 cha30 agi5 int-30 dex-5 wt0.0) awesome. got one with a guild group at<br/>
upper kobolds camp in velks lab off a named kobold. is droppable and often<br/>
offered to bards and monks.<br/>
<br/>
rings: also crafted, i wear two electrum star ruby rings for cha, switch to<br/>
resists if necessary<br/>
<br/>
bracers: singing steel (ac, effect) or sebilite scale (cha, str)<br/>
<br/>
breastplate: ss (is off your reach i guess) or imbrued if you get lucky<br/>
<br/>
greaves: same as bp<br/>
<br/>
waist: sludged girdle from sebilis. is often sold quite cheap cause its a<br/>
mostly &quot;bard only&quot; item. other melee can also wear, but ac9 int5 cha5 hp20<br/>
mana10 are not the high-end for melee-types ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my advice (hey, im not mr bard-equipment, its just my opinion =P), try to<br/>
get on hate raids for the armor (helm, bp, greaves, boots maybe. rest is<br/>
crap) and some maestro loot. invest your money in crafted items for neck and<br/>
rings, get resist gear. buy or camp the kobold jesters crown, its one of the<br/>
best bard items (monk also, no weight) i know of apart from dragon loot. the<br/>
crown should come close to the gauntlets you have worthwise and is your best<br/>
chance to invest your money imo.<br/>
<br/>
keep rocking!<br/>
