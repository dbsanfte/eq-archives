<div id="ygrps-yiv-191553746">Let&#39;s assume that you are gonna get hit.  Now, do you want +34 AC or not?<br/>
If you want to refresh the AC, pulse the song. <br/>
<br/>
I have my drum equipped because I normally use chants instead of melee<br/>
weapons.  The thing is - there are different ways of doing things.  Ever<br/>
drive on the highway and see some guy weaving in and out, passing all the<br/>
cars, because he&#39;s using &#39;superior&#39; driving skills, passes you - in the slow<br/>
lane - by.  And then, a little later, you pull up along side him at the<br/>
traffic light?  <br/>

&gt;Verses of Victory and get a still substantial ac boost which remains the<br/>
&gt;whole pulse cycle. </span></blockquote></div>
