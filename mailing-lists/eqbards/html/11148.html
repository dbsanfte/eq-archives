<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512199162">Last night I died at the EE in lower guk.  A pair of necros helped clear<br/>
the way to my corpse (one of the frogs in jail could see invis).  My job<br/>
was to chain the frogs and minos.  Blue frogs resisted at least 50% if not<br/>
more without the charisma gear on my corpse (human, put a few points in<br/>
cha, don&#39;t remember offhand, geared is 137).<br/>
<br/>
After this incident, I am on a quest to gather as much charisma equipment<br/>
as possible.  There are very few items we can wear that increase charisma<br/>
in some slots (belt, back, shoulders, next to if not nothing).  The<br/>
dexterity items that are available are excruciatingly rare drops, dragon<br/>
drops, or plane stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I would highly recommend for starting buffs to use points in dex and cha.<br/>
Strength is important yes, and you&#39;ll find yourself near encumbrance with<br/>
only armor on, especially with bronze.  I myself wore a full suit of<br/>
bronze at one point (sans helm, chain is tolerable for now but plate is<br/>
unbearable on human), and was left with maybe 4 stones worth of weight<br/>
till encumbrance set in (presong).<br/>
<br/>
This period will pass.  If you bear with it, and suffer the weight, maybe<br/>
pick up a few +3str gold amber earrings or whatever the rings are for the<br/>
interim, a bloodstained mantle, studded collar (the +3 one, whatever that<br/>
was, maybe spiked), in the long run you&#39;ll be much happier having boosted<br/>
your other attributes instead of strength.<br/>
<br/>
This assuming you spend most of your gametime at a relatively higher level<br/>
(&gt;20).  If you&#39;re an extremely slow leveller, strength might be better of<br/>
an attribute to contribute toward your utility gained from playing.<br/>
<br/>
So where might I find a Siryn Hair Hood?  EQlizer mentioned &quot;rare spawn in<br/>
Rathe Mountains,&quot; but no name was given.<br/>
<br/>
Athren Notechaser, 37 measures and still composing<br/>
