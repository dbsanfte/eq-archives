<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076496560">Greeting fellow Bards,<br/>
I was under the impression that the Antimagic Song was an AOE or party only <br/>
that prevented harmful spells from being cast on the party by any attacking <br/>
mobs. I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the Karanas Ogre <br/>
camp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song to prevent <br/>
members from being charmed.<br/>
I tried Disenchant last night after a group member was rez&#39;ed and it did not <br/>
dispell the Rez effect. It was effecting my whole party but no one reported <br/>
losing any buffs.<br/>
Is it possible the Disenchanting song and the Antimagic song effects have <br/>
been completely switched in the multitude of patches and tweaks/nerfs since <br/>
beta?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering out Loud,<br/>
