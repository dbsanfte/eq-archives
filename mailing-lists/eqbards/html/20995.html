<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058878628">Ah, a subject I know a little about - Steamfont.<br/>
<br/>
Good exp is found by killing the skeletons around the gear area, north<br/>
of the cave entrance.  Unfortunately, many others have figured this<br/>
out too.<br/>
<br/>
You can pretty safely pull one mino slaver just inside the entrance to<br/>
the caves.  Don&#39;t wander around the caves.  A great powerlevelling<br/>
technique is to have the highlevel who is camping the hero pull the<br/>
slavers out to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pull yardtrash (elementals, harpies, clockworks, rats, etc) to the<br/>
wall to fight.  Elementals, clockworks, and rats will all help each<br/>
other out.  Elementals have a very high AC and are a bit tougher to<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
If things go very bad, you can run to the guard at the windmills,<br/>
providing no one has killed the guard.<br/>
<br/>
You can climb very high on the wall north of the cave entrance, near<br/>
the large gear laying on the ground.  I found a little plateau up<br/>
there that I like to use for healing away from everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that when I first found the mino cave area in<br/>
Steamfont, there was next to no one there (around March of this<br/>
year?).  What a great place, lots of mobs, no competition.  But lately<br/>
the secret seems to be out and you will find many more folks fighting<br/>
there.<br/>
