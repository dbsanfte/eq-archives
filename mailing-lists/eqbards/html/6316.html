<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093409476"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Oh. By the way. I tried to reproduce the &quot;concert&quot; that <br/>
&gt;Harmonic Distortion did in Blackburrow. It was pretty fun. <br/>
&gt;Gnolls would run to me, and I was standing there playing <br/>
&gt;Lullaby while others killed them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now all you need is a high level druid to &#39;quake&#39; or a high<br/>
level wizard to &#39;supernova&#39; that whole crowd.  Very impressive<br/>
seeing one player kill 20 or so gnolls in one sweep.  Major<br/>
newbie impressor.<br/>

PS...<br/>
<br/>
It was mentioned that Psalm of Cooling gives ultravision, and<br/>
it most certainly does.  6pt dmg shield, ultravision, and +43<br/>
cold resist.  It really chills you to the bone, =)<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic Distortion, 34th gnoll lined up for the killing.<br/>
