=============================================<br/>
Bug Fixes:<br/>
- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<br/>
- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the<br/>
character selection screen.<br/>
- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed.<br/>
- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while<br/>
looting<br/>
- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their<br/>
spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.<br/>
- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen<br/>
if another party initiates a trade.<br/>
- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc<br/>
is charmed.<br/>
- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.<br/>
<br/>
New emotes:<br/>
- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree,<br/>
amaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk,<br/>
bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough,<br/>
cringe, curious, dance, drool , duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin ,<br/>
groan, grovel, happy, hungry, introduce, jk (just kidding) , kneel, lost,<br/>
massage, moan, mourn , peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar,<br/>
salute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease,<br/>
thank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn<br/>
<br/>
PVP Changes:<br/>
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>
viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>
cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>
do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>
20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>
the<br/>
m.<br/>
<br/>
- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect<br/>
more monsters.<br/>
<br/>
DoT Changes:<br/>
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>
works.<br/>
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>
change to how a DoT spell works.<br/>
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>
every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>
moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>
DoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>
seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>
before the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>
fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.</div>
