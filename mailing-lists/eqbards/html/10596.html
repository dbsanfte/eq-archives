<b>Subject:</b> RE: Maid and Butler camping? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-563206680">for what its worth, i went with only a druid friend.  we were both 50.  i<br/>
personally wouldn&#39;t want to go alone, but i suppose it is possible.  we<br/>
invis&#39;d and walked right into the butler&#39;s room.  i charmed the garg and had<br/>
it attack the butler (or placeholder) and the druid nuked the butler spot.<br/>
then i either charmed or pixie&#39;d the garg to stagger it a minute or two.  at<br/>
this point, i sat there while the druid pulled singles every couple minutes.<br/>
i had to follow him to the butler room, and don&#39;t know what is between the<br/>
butler and maid rooms.  so not much help there.  i can say, i got 1 EBW per<br/>
day.  i got both fangs in no longer than an 8 hour period.  from other bard<br/>
accounts, i was somewhat lucky, but not sure.  and a chunk of each time was<br/>
waiting for the damn catiff and beggin people not to kill him.  if anyone is<br/>
camping him and agrees, make sure not to tell them he disappears after you<br/>
get the sword =)  they may be expecting to let you get your sword and kill<br/>
him after.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I was just wondering if anyone can <br/>
&gt; offer any advice.<br/>
&gt; Where is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or <br/>
&gt; should I bring<br/>
&gt; along anyone else?  About how long does it take on average to get both<br/>
&gt; fangs?<br/>
&gt; Any advice would be helpful.<br/>
