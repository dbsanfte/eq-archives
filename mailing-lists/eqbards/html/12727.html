months to reply to this.  I sent him the  first draft of these questions <br/>
back in mid november.  The anfter posting it on the Sony EQ board it had to <br/>
be bump nearly 300 times before abashi even acknowledged it.<br/>

&gt;Since you were able to get a response from Abashi and GZ, you might want to<br/>
&gt;send them a reminder for when they fix the percussion aspect of Furfil&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Curtailing Chant.  Lets assume after they code the fix equipping a drum <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;now increase the damage of the DOT and the amount of magic resistance the<br/>
&gt;mobs loses.  I think we should remind them to remember the MM battle drum<br/>
&gt;when they code the fix.  Singing Furfil&#39;s with the MM battle drum equipped<br/>
&gt;should increase the DOT and magic resistance amount 20% (I think thats what<br/>
&gt;everyone says it increases resist songs by) more than with a normal drum<br/>
&gt;equipped.  Based on their track record, if we don&#39;t remind them they will<br/>
&gt;probably forget about including the MM battle drum as part of the patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion<br/>
&gt; &gt; aspect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm - don&#39;t use that one much. I&#39;ll check. If so, we&#39;ll get it fixed <br/>
&gt;right<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.<br/>
