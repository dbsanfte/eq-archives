&gt; &gt;How have they been messed up<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, not messed up for US, messed up as a data structure. Selo&#39;s canceling<br/>
&gt; other peoples SoW isn&#39;t very good programming either. Then chain not working<br/>
&gt; on SoW&#39;d mobs was pretty bad, now this.I am saying that the whole thing has<br/>
&gt; been a mess, until recently the mess has favored us...but it has been a mess<br/>
&gt; all along, just a more tolerable one, for us *smiles*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually disagree it favoured us as well, though at least we never got<br/>
slowed down without being able to respeed up very quickly. I found the<br/>
old behaviour particularly annoying as I often had to refrain from<br/>
playing selo&#39;s in a group and had to settle for the inferior SoW &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
on myself. <br/>
<br/>
As to the mess, it only servers to point out that one of two things has<br/>
happened at Verant. Either the original programmers, who wrote the bulk<br/>
of the game are gone, leaving some second string types who barely<br/>
understand the code to do the ongoing maintenance, or they just don&#39;t<br/>
care. Given the fix that was put in, I would say the former is the case.<br/>
Why I think they don&#39;t have the original programmers is that they never<br/>
would have shipped the game even after the 4 years it took in<br/>
development at the rate that the current crop of programmers is fixing<br/>
bugs, changing and adding things.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate something I posted to the list a month ago when they made<br/>
their first stab at a fix, at that time you had 2 seperate icons on<br/>
screen when you had SoW and Selo&#39;s going. So the code knew you had both<br/>
these effects. When one (SoW) wore off, it should have been trivial for<br/>
the program to check for the presence of the other one and adjust your<br/>
speed accordingly, rather than just defaulting to your character&#39;s<br/>
default speed. The fact that they couldn&#39;t accomplish this simple thing<br/>
(which also affects our levitate and water breathing songs as we know)<br/>
says something pretty sad about the current programmers. (IMO)<br/>
