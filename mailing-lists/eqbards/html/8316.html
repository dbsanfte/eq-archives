<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442437313">I used to enjoy it, but now it makes me feel very very small :)  I remember<br/>
when Shada was in the forties also, now I&#39;m eeking up to 23 and he has 2<br/>
more characters ahead of me and a third that I&#39;m sure will soon be pushing<br/>
past my slow ass as well.  Hehe!  Keep up the good work Shada!  How about<br/>
you start some characters on my server next and give me a few pointers.<br/>

can get 26th and try the ever so often mentioned &quot;fear/chain combo.&quot;<br/>
