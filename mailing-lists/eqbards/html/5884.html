<div id="ygrps-yiv-664491113">Based on an earlier post by John Kim combined with my recent experiences in<br/>
Unrest I&#39;m not so certain this is correct.  In an earlier post last week,<br/>
John (30+ bard) stated that in Unrest festering hags sometimes conned<br/>
indifferent to him while invis.  I know for a fact festering hags can see me<br/>
(22 bard) when I sing Invis (one nuked me for over 350HPs:-).  That leads me<br/>
to believe that the level of the mob compared to your level has an impact if<br/>
they can see through the song (at least in Unrest).  Caveat: its possible<br/>
the hag that attacked me cast See Invis before she attacked me but I don&#39;t<br/>
think its safe for me to test that theory at this stage of my career.  <br/>

&gt; will see you.  In Permafrost, priest-types which include:  preacher,<br/>
&gt; prelate, priests, mendicants MAY have the ability to see invis. <br/>
