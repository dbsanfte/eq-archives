That brings up a question for me :)<br/>
<br/>
Are their any upper level Bards here on E&#39;ci that have midlevel bard items<br/>
sitting in the bank collecting dust?  I would love to work out a purchase of<br/>
these items at a reasonable price...heh.  Not only could I use the things<br/>
myself, but there are two young bards in my guild that I am instructing in<br/>
&quot;bardly virtues&quot; &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

My worst leveling period was 34 to 36 for some odd reason. My cleric mate<br/>
and I set death records and lost level records til some higher level friends<br/>
of ours set us down in Garton&#39;s tower in MM and force feed us exp til we got<br/>
out of that range. We all started going to Kedge Keep about then too, no one<br/>
was there so it was really cool to have bascially your own private dungeon.<br/>
Spent from the high 30s to 50 in KK. I believe strongly this was the dungeon<br/>
V has alluded to as having the best exp modifier in the game. It better, the<br/>
loot completely sucks: just fish aned scales. Rare drops are exactly that in<br/>
KK. I do have the sharkskin drum and maybe my luck is bad but we pulled that<br/>
spawn routinely for most of the levels we spent in KK and we didn&#39;t get it<br/>
til things were starting to go green to us there. <br/>
The brakes really kick in on leveling above 50. It really goes slow. Right<br/>
now, we going to Howling Stones when we can find folks to go. That seems to<br/>
move the exp bar better than anything else we&#39;ve tried.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby I have used on the last 2 years mainly to crowd control extremely<br/>
green stuff. I should put the screenshot I have of me and about 20 froggies<br/>
in Upper Guk somewhere. I think our dispell song is completely random about<br/>
which buff it takes off and thus I never use it. Clerics get upset if you<br/>
strip off your symbol accidently. Twilight is a great song! I use the &#39;come<br/>
hither&#39; part of it as much as I use the mez portion!<br/>
<br/>
Atonal, I&#39;ll give you an armor quest! You catch big Bril in a zone with a<br/>
bank and I&#39;ll give you the 3 or 4 pieces of lambent I have in the bank, if<br/>
you want them. I think I have arms, legs, boots, and a bracer at least. It&#39;s<br/>
just taking up space and I don&#39;t know anyone in my circle of friends nutty<br/>
enough to start a bard anyway. ;)<br/>
