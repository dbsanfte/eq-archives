<div id="ygrps-yiv-375173770">whatever your opinion on this matter, there is a whole lot more to it than<br/>
just &quot;period&quot; and end of story.  if you are interested, check out our lotto<br/>
system (i&#39;ve posted it before).  single guilds who mostly work alone can do<br/>
things like this, pickup groups are a different story all together.  that&#39;s<br/>
one difference right there.  then there are just items that are much much<br/>
better used for one class than another.  the extreme, a wizard can use a<br/>
runed bolster belt (it is all/all) but you are never going to see one in a<br/>
lotto for it.  some other examples, the crystalline spear off vox is<br/>
incredibly more useful to a rogue than a bard, the mistwalker is incredibly<br/>
more useful to a ranger than a druid.  the others can use them, but they<br/>
should not be in the lotto.  there are a lot of things to think about.  i<br/>
believe the original question was a cloak of flames and a bard.  that&#39;s a<br/>
very tough one.  bards are considered melee by my guild, so we would be<br/>
allowed in on the lotto, but you must also realize you must kill 30 dragons<br/>
before you have the points to claim it.  i&#39;ve got enough now for a belt or<br/>
cloak, but there has been someone with more points than me at the last few<br/>
dragons where they have dropped.  my chances get better each time.  so our<br/>
system takes into account time of participation and usefulness to the class.<br/>
whether you &quot;can&quot; use it and whether you &quot;will&quot; is also a big consideration.<br/>
