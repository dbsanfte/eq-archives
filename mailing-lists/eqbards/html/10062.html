<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185200927"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    I too wish Lambent was nodrop, I&#39;m tired of seeing level 10 bards<br/>
&gt;    running around in partial or (god forbid) full blue.  I never gave<br/>
&gt;    away crafted armor when it was the hot thing to make.  I always<br/>
&gt;    made said person at least pay my cost, and even then I wouldnt<br/>
&gt;    sell it to anyone below level 15.  There&#39;s no way a level 10<br/>
&gt;    should be carrying several hundred plat around to purchase this<br/>
&gt;    kind of armor anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the things my guild does for each other is sharing cash and/or items,<br/>
to help each other out. I have a L10 Warrior who has crafted greaves ONLY<br/>
because a guild member had them, and another guild member was willing to<br/>
share his extra cash to help pay the cost for them. One of the things I see<br/>
people complaining about is that people are being &quot;scabs/stingey&quot; with the<br/>
money/items/spawns.... but I see nothing wrong with people wanting to be<br/>
generous with items that they have NO other use for.... Personally, I want<br/>
to do the quests for the armor for my bard, because that&#39;s part of the fun<br/>
of the game.... but I don&#39;t want to take away from those who are just trying<br/>
to be helpful to their friends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    There really arent enough bards out there to drive<br/>
&gt;    the price of lambent up, so I would expect to pay the cost of<br/>
&gt;    jewels, maybe 25pp for the stone, and add 25-50 % markup for the<br/>
&gt;    effort to acquire nodrops.  These items arent worth much more than<br/>
&gt;    that.  And it&#39;s not like the guy is gonna say: Fine, I&#39;ll just<br/>
&gt;    find another bard who wants it.  Bard armor and items in general<br/>
&gt;    dont unload that easy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you there... there aren&#39;t enough bards to drive up the price<br/>
and most bards I know, including myself, would prefer to get the stuff<br/>
themselves. But I don&#39;t agree with the markup if it&#39;s for a friend...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    I feel your pain, lower level bards.  You get bronze now at such<br/>
&gt;    an early age and so cheap, after wearing it for 5 - 10 levels you<br/>
&gt;    desparately want an upgrade path and there is none.  Such is the<br/>
&gt;    price you pay for being given cheap mid level items.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;    there.  And there&#39;s nothing like earning your own stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I don&#39;t understand the attitude here.... My bard was given various<br/>
armor items at fairly low levels, some by complete strangers who had no more<br/>
use for them, some by what was then my husbands guild and is now also<br/>
mine... and it didn&#39;t make me &quot;beg&quot; for more from people, nor did it make me<br/>
yearn for things before I should be able to get them.... I was just happy to<br/>
get them - AND, grateful to those who would be so generous as to share them<br/>
with me. It also made me want to help others in the same way, which I have.<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the attitude of some who would say that I&#39;ve paid a price<br/>
for being given items.....???? I know the value of working for things -<br/>
believe me - and it didn&#39;t take Everquest to do it... Real life does that to<br/>
a person all on its own!<br/>
