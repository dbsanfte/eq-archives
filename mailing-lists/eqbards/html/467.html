<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796013112">Well I have been playing for awhile. I dont know what you are spending you<br/>
money on but I had an entire suit of leather by 7th level. I guess its how<br/>
you play. You get in a hurry and wanna kill everythig in site, waste time<br/>
screwing around ect. Patience is key. Get your armor. Get prepared before<br/>
you start &quot;adventuring&quot;. The ill prepared seems to always die. Ya it gets<br/>
mundane. Sometime you have to kill stuff that doesnt give you exp. But its<br/>
easy to make 5 plat in a night or more killing bugs, spiders and skels. The<br/>
armor...not that patchwork garbage will pay you back 10 fold. If you make it<br/>
fine no prob. But I did not make squat, wouldnt buy it or wear it. Im 20ish<br/>
level now in what 3 weeks? and no im not 24 7 player. Just being prepared is<br/>
the key and knowing the bard. The patchwork is a waste of money and skill<br/>
points i will always say :-) Play smart Play Prepared. That scarab will tear<br/>
you up in patchwork. In leather you will solo it.<br/>

&gt;Being a tailor, I take exception to this statement.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt;do respect your opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just by a piece of leather  or<br/>
&gt;&gt; raw hide, (same stats cept raw-hide is heavier) You can get a full suit<br/>

&gt;Hahah, easy for a higher level player to say.  Patchwork, going for<br/>
&gt;about 2pp per piece, or less with quantity, is within reach of the<br/>
&gt;low level players.<br/>
&gt;The fact that several pieces of armour are not available in patchwork<br/>
&gt;means you should do both IMHO.  Buy the patchwork (or make it) at a<br/>
&gt;lower level, and upgrade as you can affort it, purchasing those<br/>
&gt;pieces that aren&#39;t available as patchwork first.  I see no point<br/>
&gt;in shelling out for a leather tunic when you have a patchwork tunic,<br/>
&gt;but no shoulder pads or face mask.  Sure, a tunic has higher AC, but<br/>
&gt;I think that a patchwork tunic plus another piece of leather (or two)<br/>
&gt;would have higher AC than the leather tunic alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Patchwork...blah. Waste of skill points and<br/>
&gt;&gt; money.<br/>
&gt;Again, I disagree.  Studded and reinforced, well, that&#39;s another<br/>
&gt;discussion.<br/>
