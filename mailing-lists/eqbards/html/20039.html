&gt; to a good group and basically rendered the bard obsolete, I <br/>
&gt; should retire my<br/>
&gt; bard and work on getting one of my more viable classes <br/>
&gt; leveled up.  It was<br/>
&gt; suggested, though never directly stated, that an enchanter <br/>
&gt; made having a<br/>
&gt; bard more or less a waste of time unless you really needed manasong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forgive me if I get this all wrong, my memory&#39;s not the best.  A while back<br/>
some bard was distressed because the group he was hunting with in one of the<br/>
Sols kept insisting that he tank.  When he tanked, he died.  When he refused<br/>
to tank, the others grouped without him claiming they could handled just as<br/>
many mobs without a bard as with one.  What&#39;s more his group suggested he<br/>
retire the bard and roll up a warrior so that he could tank without dieing.<br/>
Was that you, Kitasi?  My advice at the time was to get some new friends.<br/>
My advice now is to get some new friends.  <br/>
