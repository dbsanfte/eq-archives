offcamera in first person view).  I often use the external view to monitor<br/>
stuff, like I used it during a GM event to see what was going on in the<br/>
middle of a crowd (took a bit of camera manipulation to get right).  The<br/>
back view I don&#39;t use very often, sometimes to look over someone in front<br/>
of me, or to get a neat ss.<br/>

stick with keyboard movement due to mouse skippage (lag causing one to<br/>
spin in a circle).  I&#39;m fairly comfortable integrating both keyboard and<br/>
mouse for my activities, likely due to a history of FPS-type games.  Both<br/>
have their advantages and disadvandages.<br/>
