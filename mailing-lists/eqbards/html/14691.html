<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237086231">I remembered some connection between Lord G and the Waki - and a post you<br/>
made about giving him the LotGP and getting nada (and then killing him for<br/>
his impertenance?) Did not remember is he was the original Waki quest or if<br/>
he was only a rumor of something.  Thanks for the info!<br/>

&gt; waki quest before the maid/butler.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   heard the rumor of the quest connected to him and Mistmoore, I never<br/>
