&gt;Fellow Historians of Norrath, Well met!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i have a most unusual tale to tell today of my adventures in the<br/>
&gt;commonlands..<br/>
&gt;.......................................................................<br/>
<br/>
    Alas, ars you have mentioned the Freeport Millita is not the noble<br/>
orgination that they seek to be preceived as. As my travles have lead me to<br/>
descover, the members of the Freeport millita are seeking their own<br/>
agendias, amoung them is the complete and unjust controll of the city. I was<br/>
shocked to discuber this from Kala at the Temple of Truth and others.<br/>
<br/>
    It seems that the leader of the Millita is seaking control of the city<br/>
though anymeans possable, and they are not to be trusted. As I find out more<br/>
on Kala&#39;s quest, I will kep you appraised.<br/>
