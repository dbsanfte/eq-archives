<b>Subject:</b> Off Topic - Brewers Protest March <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-801647664">Greetings my fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
   Faeelin is organizing a Brewers Protest March on<br/>
the Fennin Ro server.  The plan is to meet on the<br/>
East Freeport Docks on Saturday at 10:00pm Eastern<br/>
 time. If you are not on Fenin Ro, like me, create a<br/>
character using the same name you now use, providing<br/>
it is available.  Meet us there and we will begin our<br/>
protest with petitions to GMs, shouts in the zone,<br/>
etc.  The protest will then move to other zones to<br/>
bring our plight to the people of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
   If you see the Roleplaying value of a viable Brewing<br/>
trade, and can see the benefit of a working and<br/>
beneficial Alchohol Tollerance skill, then please come<br/>
out in support of this cause.  For what is a Bard without<br/>
a good Brew, a good fire and an audiance to hear his<br/>
tales.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
