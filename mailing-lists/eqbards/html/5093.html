<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375199776">From my vast research, I have discovered that buffing yourself or other<br/>
people in your party while in combat can really hurt the mob&#39;s feelings and<br/>
he will try to go after yah, and the majority of our songs are buffing, or<br/>
debuffing. (combat at least).  But things like just standing in the middle<br/>
of everfrost, and all of a sudden a band of skeletons jumps you must a mob<br/>
specific aggresive trait.  Another combat reason for mob hate towards us, is<br/>
our naturally lower hp than most hybrids.<br/>

&gt;Something I&#39;ve noticed in a great many zones (I love to travel and we do it<br/>
&gt;very fast, very early) is that there are a great many creature types that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;seem to like music.. Perhaps they just don&#39;t appreciate its gentle rythm<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;cadence, but I happened upon a document in Everfrost the other day about a<br/>
&gt;named skeleton called &#39;vengeful lyric&#39;.. Someone who was looking for Karg<br/>
&gt;Icebear out near the entrance to Permafrost said that he had just seen this<br/>
&gt;skel take off like a shot.. I didn&#39;t think anything about it at the time,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;had just started playing Selo&#39;s at the entrance to Halas..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Within mere seconds this mob was all over me.. he was way too big for me to<br/>
&gt;kill (yet)..  But I firmly believe that there are creatures that DO NOT<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bards instinctively.. as a list the following creatures dislike my bard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;than they dislike my Warrior (same level, race and have killed the same<br/>
&gt;creatures)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;beetles (all)<br/>
&gt;undead (greater and magic hit only it seems)<br/>
&gt;griffons<br/>
&gt;evil eyes<br/>
&gt;plague rats<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps.. Still need to look into others, but I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>
&gt;&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; bit of a surprise.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>
&gt;&gt; rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every<br/>
 </span></blockquote>greater,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>
&gt;&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker - thankfully, I am<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; only one that died.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>
&gt;&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less long)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>
