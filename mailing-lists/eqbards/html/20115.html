&gt;enchanter in the group except when i was soloing thru level 5.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>my first real partner and the person who i started playing because of was<br/>
great as a warrior. we did awesome. then we both started new chars bard/enc.<br/>
i nearly quit playing eq, lost him as a friend, and ya. what a horrible time<br/>
that was. i avoid them now, since following experiences with encs and i just<br/>
don&#39;t mix. imho, i think enc&#39;s have a certain personality type that just<br/>
don&#39;t mix with bards. hehe<br/>
