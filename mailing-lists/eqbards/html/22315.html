<b>Subject:</b> Re: Having problems with 39 charm song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901580114">The only times I have trouble getting my pet to attack (with the 39 <br/>
song) is if the command comes too close to a previous /pet command or <br/>
I&#39;m too far away from him to hear the message.<br/>
<br/>
From your example, if all those commands are in ONE hotkey, then I&#39;d <br/>
say that is the problem.  I haven&#39;t had success making a hotkey of:<br/>
<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
<br/>
It will only do the /pet back off portion.  If those commands are <br/>
typed in or done at an interval, then I&#39;m not sure what the problem <br/>
is, other than a surly pet.  My surly pets end up dead.... Hmmm... It <br/>
so happens that my good pets end up dead as well...<br/>
