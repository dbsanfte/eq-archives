<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463934191">Yes I know but I remember when I was a newbie I had to worry about griffins<br/>
and giants all the time now they are rare to find as a newbie. Overall<br/>
newbies have it a lot easier now then I or anybody else ever did. A little<br/>
toughness to the game isn&#39;t going to hurt them at all. It&#39;s a lot easier to<br/>
buy equipment now as a newbie, it&#39;s a lot easier overall to play the game. I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t remember myself or other newbies asking for teleport&#39;s, now<br/>
that&#39;s a common site. People will get over it aventually and if worst comes<br/>
to worst they can travel through Rathe Mountains.<br/>

&gt;Heh heh, except that on most servers there were 150+ people in Kithicor at<br/>
&gt;the time.  Of course that still wasn&#39;t enough to prevent many deaths.  I<br/>
&gt;agree that high level players desperately need an outdoor zone where they<br/>
&gt;can adventure and gain xp and items and have fun.  If its Kithicor that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;cool, a pain in the butt to travel thru but that&#39;s life.  Why there are no<br/>
&gt;high level outdoor zones I cannot say.  A high level zone with non-PoF high<br/>
&gt;level mobs with big agro radii would be interesting.  Dangerous, and o&#39;<br/>

&gt;The thing is the though the high levels need a good fun area to hunt that<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t way overcrowded. I was on my necro the other day doing a quest and in<br/>
&gt;Unrest the zone had only 19 people in it during prime time. Then CT is just<br/>
&gt;as empty to. Then you go and look at Lower Guk and Sol B and see it pakced<br/>
&gt;with 50+ people in it. Thanks to the new kith zone and PoH the high levels<br/>
&gt;are finnally starting to spreadout. It&#39;s a lot better that it&#39;s a high<br/>

&gt;&gt;Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>
&gt;&gt;events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>
&gt;&gt;live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
