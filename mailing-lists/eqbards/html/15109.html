<div id="ygrps-yiv-453575974"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Actually, I&#39;ve found with sense heading, wisdom seems more of a bonus<br/>
&gt;than int, because sense heading skill only improves when it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;successful, unlike most other skills. And, wisdom definately seems to<br/>
&gt;make a difference with it improving. The easiest way I&#39;ve found to deal<br/>
&gt;with sense heading is to not waste time on it until you can dump 20 odd<br/>
&gt;points into it. That usually means around L5 or 6. Then start mashing it<br/>
&gt;while medding or resting. At least with wisdom casters like my druid and<br/>
&gt;cleric, this method seems much less painful than I remember it was for<br/>
&gt;my bard. IIRC, with my bard I used to fish and practice sense heading.<br/>
&gt;It went up a lot slower and the fishing wasn&#39;t worth the time spent on<br/>
&gt;it, unlike in beta when not only could fishing be slightly profitable<br/>
&gt;but you also had a cool social scene around the docks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey! Who says fishing isn&#39;t worth the time spent on it?<br/>
All of my characters do fishing as a major pasttime of their lives!<br/>
Fish sell for 2s each! And when you fish up sandals (Meara is still<br/>
wearing Tattered Sandals she fished up), fish scales (Water Breathing<br/>
anyone?) and Rusty daggers, they don&#39;t even use a lure up!<br/>
<br/>
Faerain sits around fishing while she maxes out various spell<br/>
skills. (She made 19 and teleports last night!) And Faesong uses<br/>
the fish in her baking skills.<br/>
