I have just looged after testing &#39;Disenchanting Melody&#39; (bard cancel<br/>
magic song which finally works!) and have some bad bad bad news to<br/>
report. Aria of Eagles (bard levitate song) is bugged!!<br/>
<br/>
After starting the song, two red messages apear &#39;you are already<br/>
floating&#39; and then the song stops (you stop floating) - it restarts on<br/>
the next pulse. So, basically, levitate works for three pulses, stops<br/>
for one, works for three, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is unacceptable, and I /bugged it immediately. I would ask that<br/>
you all test this, not only bards, since it may effect caster levitate<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
