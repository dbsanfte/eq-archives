<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819160656">That&#39;s odd, I equip mine all the time.  It does not act as a stringed<br/>
instrument though.  You can equip it with a weapon which really makes some<br/>
older bards who don&#39;t know the secret jump.  Nothing like having a 40th<br/>
level bard begging you to tell how you managed to have an instrument and a<br/>
weapon equipped at once and where you got this lute they never heard of.<br/>

I tried this recently, but Lisera (from Cassius at the Bard Guild in Qeynos)<br/>
is not equippable.<br/>
