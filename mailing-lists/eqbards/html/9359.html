<div id="ygrps-yiv-458931375">The way to dance is to target another player and hit your instill doubt <br/>
button.  The dance isn&#39;t as obvious in combat.  Get right in his face when <br/>
he&#39;s resting and you have a chance of scaring the pants off him in RL.  <br/>
Sadly, you will get the message &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anybody&quot; in EQ.  If my <br/>
fifty or so attempts are any indication, you don&#39;t get any better trying this <br/>
on PCs, but it&#39;s still amusing.  If you&#39;ve tried it and still don&#39;t dance, it <br/>
probably IS gender-related.<br/>
<br/>
It has the same result as Screech, but not area effect.  It also fails a lot <br/>
more often.  Don&#39;t practice in combat unless you are able to whistle <br/>
innocently when your party asks &quot;Why did the MOB start running?&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of funny dances -<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How does one do the instill doubt thing?  Don&#39;t bards get to be fake monk<br/>
&gt; dancers at some point?  Is this also gender inhibited?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Woo hoo - cant wait to drop that point into tracking and be a wanna be<br/>
&gt; ranger!!<br/>
