<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Instrument vs. melee attacks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165146145">Just a note on a past thread...<br/>
<br/>
Recently started using all instrument attacks and<br/>
found I have far better damage that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I was initially dismayed that DDD gives a &quot;wince&quot;<br/>
message because parties are often sensitive about<br/>
damage contributions to a fight.  I thought hard about<br/>
just using weapons for a few levels.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to test my attacks:<br/>
SO I was soloing a gorge hound (intrument attack) at<br/>
lvl 18 in EK, taking ALOT of damage when the hound<br/>
finally died, I had 1.5 bubbles of health left....but<br/>
there was something wrong....the hound&#39;s health bar<br/>
was still showing some red.  THen I realized, I was<br/>
soloing not one, but two hounds.  <br/>
<br/>
I quickly killed the hound and healed myself....but<br/>
with a slightly different perspective on music attacks<br/>
AND, I now use the third person view;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Weapon Combo: 	PGT and Dragoon Dirk	6/26 and 6/23<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 			Songs Sung:		Warsong, Chant of Battle,<br/>
&gt; Hymn<br/>
&gt; 			Damage/Second:	4.56		vs. Gargoyle Blue<br/>
&gt; Cons<br/>
&gt; 			Heal/Second:	1.0<br/>
&gt; 			Total:		5.56<br/>
&gt; 			Added Benefit:	Plus AC, Damage Screen	2.3 times<br/>
&gt; per fight<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Instrument Combo:	Brass and Strings		Both store<br/>
&gt; bought,<br/>
&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 			Songs Sung:		Chords, Denon&#39;s, Hymn<br/>
&gt; 			Damage/Second:	4.15		(using formula with<br/>
&gt; resist% for each)<br/>
&gt; 			Heal/Second:	1.5<br/>
&gt; 			Total:		5.65<br/>
&gt; 			Added Benefit:	Total Damage vs 2 mobs = 9.80/sec<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 			General Formula:	3.33(R1) + 2.33(R2)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 						R1 = % Denon&#39;s not resisted<br/>
&gt; 						R2 = % Chords not resisted<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 						Denon&#39;s was resisted 40%,<br/>
&gt; Chords 10%<br/>
&gt; 						Gargoyles have high MR?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		Analysis:	I found that Largo&#39;s outperformed Hymn<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; singing.  Looks <br/>
&gt; 				like at 23rd level the two are pretty<br/>
&gt; balanced, at least<br/>
&gt; 				against gargoyles.  I definitely had fewer<br/>
&gt; missed notes and<br/>
&gt; 				less twiddling while meleeing.  The fights<br/>
&gt; with 3+ Damage<br/>
&gt; 				Screen Procs went really well, the fights in<br/>
&gt; all instrument<br/>
&gt; 				did not vary as much as the melee ones.<br/>
&gt; Overall melee still <br/>
&gt; 				won out slightly over instruments but its<br/>
&gt; close to changing<br/>
&gt; 				and that is apparent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				24 will see a damage output increase for the<br/>
&gt; all instrument<br/>
&gt; 				attack due to lvl/6 and lvl/3 equations.<br/>
&gt; Maybe 24 is the<br/>
&gt; 				turning point for a bard?  Also note weapon<br/>
&gt; procs will<br/>
&gt; 				drastically change these numbers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				With all instruments I still couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
&gt; 2 gargs at once<br/>
&gt; 				so multiple mob damage would be moot while<br/>
&gt; soloing.<br/>
