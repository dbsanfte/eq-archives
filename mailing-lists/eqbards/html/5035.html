&gt; couldn&#39;t loot his wife&#39;s NO DROP item.  <br/>
&gt; If she had consent you, you can target<br/>
&gt; her corpse and use /corpse to drag her<br/>
&gt; corpse to a safe location for her to<br/>
&gt; loot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was aware of this, the only reason I<br/>
was looting her corpse for her was because<br/>
we were 3 zones away from her bind point..<br/>
Being that I couldn&#39;t get those items for<br/>
her meant that she had to come and get them..</div>
