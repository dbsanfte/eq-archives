&gt; There was a poll on Everlore, I believe, and only 6% of the player base has<br/>
&gt; a character between 45-50.  Some attention has to be given to high level<br/>
&gt; folks, but if that poll is accurate, they make up such a small portion of<br/>
&gt; the population that they shouldn&#39;t get ALL the attention.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brad has already stated publicly that the majority of their customers<br/>
have mid level characters. He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>
can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>
direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>
example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>
you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>
poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>
understand the difference.<br/>
