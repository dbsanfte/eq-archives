			Of course with a drum and chant, you can&#39;t hit too<br/>
hard anyway :)  I<br/>
		have no specific tests to prove it, but it *seems* that I<br/>
get more hits in<br/>
		when My dex is above 130, compared to unbuffed 105.  Of<br/>
course, we&#39;ve been<br/>
		through the arguments about seeing what you want to see, so<br/>
that&#39;s probably<br/>
		a good portion of it.  I think the problem with testing, is<br/>
I&#39;d have to duel<br/>
		someone, not just go for mobs.  Maybe I&#39;ll talk a level 22<br/>
bard friend of<br/>
		mine into a duel sometime this week, with and without buffs.</div>
