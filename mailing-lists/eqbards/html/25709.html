<b>Subject:</b> silly questions from an old timer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035935707">Well, I took a break from eq when daoc came out, and honestly love daoc, but<br/>
dying 3 times in a row at 30+ hurts like hell and is pretty demoralizing,<br/>
and well I kinda missed my eq guild (people are less chatty in daoc). So I<br/>
reactivated my account last night and am back in eq...<br/>
<br/>
Question for the lot of ya:<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to disable the song timer? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s driving me nuts, its throwing my timing off when I&#39;m twisting songs.  <br/>
Oh and another question, is the new 52 haste song better then the 54 haste<br/>
we have from before?<br/>
<br/>
sorry, I been out of the loop for bout 3-4 months, trying to read up on as<br/>
much as possible in a short time.<br/>
