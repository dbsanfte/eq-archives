<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905796901">The nice quest for low level bards is the Spider Silk Quest in Kelethin. For<br/>
turning in four Spiderling Silk to the GuildMistress there, you get some<br/>
cash (I forget how much, not a whole lot), faction, and a free drum.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the other quests are fairly mundane, if not useless. But, recently,<br/>
Verant has implemented the &#39;FedEx&#39; quests, delivering mail all over<br/>
Freeport. If you know you&#39;re going to be traveling between cities, check<br/>
with the local FedEx Bard. These quests will usually net you between 1 and 9<br/>
gold. Lately, I&#39;ve been based in Qeynos. I&#39;ve also been spending time in<br/>
Surefall Glade (They REALLY like followers of Tuanre there!) I&#39;ve been<br/>
working on my Fletchery Skill (and I get some awesome prices there). Anyway,<br/>
the FedEx bard there just happens to want mail delivered to Qeynos. I&#39;ve<br/>
only completed this quest twice, but a total of 3 gold for two trips I was<br/>
making anyway, really isn&#39;t all that bad. Maybe not so big a deal if you&#39;re<br/>
higher in level, but down here at 10, every gold counts...<br/>

&gt; Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts? I completed the string quest at the<br/>
&gt; qeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits and a litle bit<br/>
&gt; of exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low level ( at +-<br/>
7<br/>
&gt; ), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s and the drum,<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; shadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think) was very<br/>
jealous,<br/>
&gt; he walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport :)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for most quests is,<br/>
&gt; because walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not worth it.<br/>
&gt; And getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>
