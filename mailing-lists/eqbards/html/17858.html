<div id="ygrps-yiv-224049216">I&#39;m in complete agreement with Syl on this issue. If you are going on a <br/>
raid, and want to be considered for loot (who wouldn&#39;t?) I would definitely <br/>
get info on how it will be done before going. The only problem with this is <br/>
on Veeshan, FG&#39;s tend to be spur of the moment with people racing to kill <br/>
them when they are found to be alive. Basically, on our server FG&#39;s usually <br/>
don&#39;t last much longer than an hour or two after they have popped(depending <br/>
on the efficiency of the raiders).<br/>
<br/>
Bards should be a primary consideration for this item IMO, though I think <br/>
enchanters should get dibs on it. Monks - definitely. Then anyone else. I <br/>
hear necros need CHA. For what I&#39;m not exactly sure (my friend told me, but <br/>
I forget).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, Madagan - If you are in a pick up group situation on any raid <br/>
find out how loot will be distributed. Since half the raids on Veeshan are <br/>
mixed group/guild/pick-up group-based, I think randoming works out fine. <br/>
What you need to find out is who will be allowed to roll for what. I heard <br/>
bards were passed over for the last Orb of Tishani in rolling with only <br/>
casters allowed to /random. Total B.S. if you ask me...Though I only do <br/>
raids with my guild, and everything is pre-determined on who gets what, I&#39;d <br/>
love to find out made that decision to oust the bard in favor of the <br/>
enchanter on your FG raid... =)<br/>

&gt;People should discuss Loot Rules *before* you start the raid so that<br/>
&gt;*everyone* understands how loot will be distributed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;all random on all items<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;some guru decides who gets what or who gets to roll for what<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;alpha loot - splits off (double a&#39;s go last) heh, been a while since<br/>
&gt;HighKeep?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Especially pick-up groups.  Why go if you wont get paid?  In a pick-up<br/>
&gt;group, I believe that everyone should be allowed to roll for any item they<br/>
&gt;want.  Also, if stated ahead of time, once you win a roll, you dont roll<br/>
&gt;until every one wins something.  Thats for pickup groups.  In my guild<br/>
&gt;groups, we go by our guild policy which is based on highest and best use of<br/>
&gt;items, etc. and GM or raid leader has final say<br/>
&gt;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pantheon.worldshock.com/articles/looting/index.htm">http://pantheon.worldshock.com/articles/looting/index.htm</a> ).  I think<br/>
&gt;Miriana posted that link before but there it is again. I am sure there are<br/>
&gt;other good loot schemes but to me the most important factor is knowing what<br/>
&gt;the rules are before you play the game.  Do not go on those stoopid pick-up<br/>
&gt;raids unless you have a clear understand of how loot will be distributed -<br/>
&gt;ahead of time.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night on Veeshan a few members from 3-4 guilds participated in a <br/>
&gt;Fire<br/>
&gt; &gt; Giant run,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just thought I would post this here and see whether you guys and girls<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>
