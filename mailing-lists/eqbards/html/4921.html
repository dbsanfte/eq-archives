<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-9352585">ORIG MESSAGE - CUT:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HOW do you get an inventory slot into a Hot Key Slot? I&#39;ve tried doing the<br/>
&gt;&quot;drag&quot; Thing and it doesn&#39;t work. Could I be doing something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so much &quot;drag&quot; as it is clicking and holding the left mouse button<br/>
over the inventory slot - your mouse pointer should then visually turn into<br/>
the inventory slot - you can release the button - then move the inventory<br/>
slot mouse over the hotkey slot you want to put it in and click it in place.<br/>
Make sure the upper left hand corner of the inventory slot picture is in the<br/>
middle of the hotkey slot in which you are placing else it won&#39;t work.<br/>
Again, hope this helped.<br/>
