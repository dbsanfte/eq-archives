You will find all the luclin bard spells in Katta Castellum...the loc is: 640<br/>
-330 and the name of the vendor is &quot;Sellar Mulletune&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the lamest of all songs, though, completely useless to you. The ONLY<br/>
thing it does is let a non-magical weapon hit monsters which can only be hit<br/>
by magic weapons. Since even decaying skeletons drop magic weapons, by 9th<br/>
level you certainly should already have one...and what&#39;s more, almost nothing<br/>
you fight at 9th will be invulnerable to non-magic weapons yet.<br/>
