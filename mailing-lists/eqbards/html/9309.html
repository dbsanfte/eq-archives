&gt; &gt; At higher levels, the bard usually sticks with the main party<br/>

&gt; &gt; you never get a chance to Lament.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not only that, but at higher levels, Lament fails - a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was fighting shadowed men all last night, and I would<br/>
&gt; guess my success rate with Lament was in the neighbourhood<br/>
&gt; of 40%.  Actually, that&#39;s probably pretty high.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There was a thread on the Concert Hall board which said Lament<br/>
started to fail a lot more in your 20s and 30s, but started to<br/>
work again soon after.  Like I said, I got lazy and rarely<br/>
used it in my 20s and 30s (grouping with an enchanter will do<br/>
that :).  But at level 40 I&#39;ve used it pretty extensively the<br/>
last few days.  I&#39;ve yet to have it fail, and it&#39;s only been<br/>
resisted once (mob did not attack though).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I did use it for a bit around L30 when I was pulling in<br/>
Cazic.  I distinctly recall it failing several times there,<br/>
but for the most part it worked.  Most of the failures were<br/>
straight resists causing unlamented mobs to come along.  There<br/>
were only 2 or 3 times where a lamented mob joined in.  My chr<br/>
is unusually high though, 120 back then, 140 now.<br/>
