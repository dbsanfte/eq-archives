 </span></blockquote>Yep.  Me too.  Innoruuk the price is maybe 1pp per AC if you&#39;re lucky.  100pp for a full set, again if<br/>
you&#39;re lucky.  Not worth my time anymore.  If it ever really was.  I&#39;d be level 50 now if I hadn&#39;t stopped<br/>
and doing Smithing for awhile, and I&#39;d have a lot more cash now, too.<br/>
