the &quot;path&quot; back in.  So they continually try to walk thru the wall forever,<br/>
getting nowhere.<br/>

&gt;I saw him the saturday nite.  He was in the room next to the enchanter<br/>
&gt;vendor but sorta in the wall next to the door ourside, half of his body was<br/>
&gt;in the wall the other half not.  Once I do another deliver that way I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;check it out again.  What do NPC&#39;s do if they get stuck in walls, and how<br/>
&gt;does that happen in the first place..?<br/>
