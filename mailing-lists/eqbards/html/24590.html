<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136627595">I&#39;ve been involved with the XA since earlier days and am a big booster...<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of raiding with my new guild - Dragons of Kel&#39;dar (long<br/>
before I was a member) - that was mostly with other guilds (Greys and<br/>
Crusaders of the High Plains IIRC)..<br/>

This is not just Xegony info., but I&#39;m a Bard there too and also find it<br/>
difficult to find raid groups in the 50ish range - especially late PST<br/>
when I play duee to family commitments. The small guild I&#39;m in sometimes<br/>
teams up with Knights In Arms or Xegony Alliance - where I&#39;ve run into<br/>
both Slyde and Darkfox.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious how everyone feels about XA like inter-guild organizations<br/>
and what kind of experience they&#39;ve had with them?<br/>
