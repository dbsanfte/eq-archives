hehe one of the bards I saw doing this was 34th, they should know better.  <br/>
It is easy to tell they are only bellowing since the bellow messages are <br/>
very close together.  And the standard combat lined I use is available to a <br/>
Bard of only 25 songs.  Even at 25th level where psalm only gives a 4 pt <br/>
damage shield it is still much more effective then a bellow in the over all <br/>
damage scheme.  It does seem the the High keep basement is immune to the <br/>
Z-axis bug, as I have used melodic binding in a two bard party in both the <br/>
warrior and raider room :)<br/>

&gt;Ya gotta remember the other bards might not be at the same lev u r.  If you<br/>
&gt;got charm and mez - u r not in the lookout room &lt;g&gt; you&#39;re a couple levels<br/>
&gt;deeper!  I know I get lots of good advice from a fellow bard but it usually<br/>
&gt;includes using a couple songs that I don&#39;t get for a couple more levels -<br/>
&gt;careful readers saw one today - I asked of which 2 songs is better at<br/>
&gt;slowing attack speeds and I got told that 2 other songs are better - well<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s all fine and dandy but I don&#39;t got them songs (not even pre-bought<br/>
&gt;cuz I know what bad luck that brings ya &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So - ya we bellow - but that might be the best we got?  And there maybe a<br/>
&gt;couple &quot;surge of strength...&quot; and &quot;protected by magical aura...&quot; that u<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see (cuz u r not grouped with them) between the bellows u do see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW - I got pretty brave now - in HighKeep I&#39;ll use Denon&#39;s and Lullaby --<br/>
&gt;AE or Z-axis seem to be no problems.  Well  the other rooms are well camped<br/>
&gt;usually  but I don&#39;t see any hits or misses on stuff from the other rooms.<br/>
&gt;Only potential problems is some gobbie train goes up and Guards come down<br/>
&gt;chasing it back down - saw  Captn Boesic ks&#39;ing on the ramp the other day -<br/>
&gt;offered to train him out for 20pp but got no takers :-)  Or if u run up<br/>
&gt;chasin some gobbie and forget and leave Denons on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hehe AE and Z axis are not just deadly indoors.........there I was...pullin<br/>
&gt;for my group off the aviak villiage.  So I run in to nab something and it<br/>
&gt;musta been right after a fight - we were all SoW&#39;d (which I normally rant<br/>
&gt;about but was a good thing this time) and I musta forgot and left Denons on<br/>
&gt;- so I make a fast lap around the trees and don&#39;t see nutthin - then hmm a<br/>
&gt;harrier at the ramp - bellow! /g inc harrier run back the party - turn<br/>
&gt;around and .... 6 birties including Mr Avo!!!  &quot;Nice pull Sylly!&quot;  LOADING,<br/>
&gt;PLEASE WAIT  The rest of the party took off for the zone and lived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So my 1 thru 4 hot keys are buff du jour (anthem or chant depending on if<br/>
&gt;party likes str or dex), bellow, denons, chains  - this is for me being<br/>
&gt;battle bard and in melee combat.  Other song loaded are lullaby, guardian<br/>
&gt;rythmns, hymn,  and jig  (hmm usually have selos up too but inside Keep no<br/>
&gt;need really.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sylly<br/>
