<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667537158">Some of the people who run ShowEQ have been trying to come up with an<br/>
experience formula.  They have come up with some formulas that<br/>
explain much of the hell level and hell level +1 effects.  Based on their<br/>
formulas (which are only a guess) I think the difference in experience loss<br/>
can be explained.<br/>
<br/>
lvl, exp needed, exp lost  (examples made up)<br/>
--------------------<br/>
lvl 29    5000    500<br/>
lvl 30    10000   500<br/>
lvl 31    2500    500<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed for hell<br/>
level takes a big jump, and there is a dip afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
A death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>
A death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>
A death at 31 costs you a full bubble.<br/>
But the total experience loss is the same in each case.<br/>
(based on the made of example above)<br/>
<br/>
Since experience for HL+1 is so much less than HL, the same amount of<br/>
experience loss will result in a bigger percentage of the bar.  You are not<br/>
really losing that much more experience numerically, but just graphically.<br/>
<br/>
You can test this yourself by measuring how long it takes to make up from a<br/>
death in HL vs HL+1.  The time to regain the lost experience should be<br/>
roughly equal, therefore the loss is roughly equal.  Your bar dropped more<br/>
in HL+1, but you regain it faster.<br/>

&gt; You have it backwards, but yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I died at 47, I only lost a half bubble into 46.  All my<br/>
&gt; friends who died at 46 said they lost over a bubble. That<br/>
&gt; indicates the exp loss at 47 is less than the exp loss at 46.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I died at 31, I lost a half bubble into 30.  When I died<br/>
&gt; at 30, I lost a quarter bubble.  That indicates the exp loss<br/>
&gt; at 31 is more than the exp loss at 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both of these indicate the exp loss at (hell level+1) is<br/>
&gt; greater than at other levels. </span></blockquote></div>
