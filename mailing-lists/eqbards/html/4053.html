<div id="ygrps-yiv-709630774">I disagree- the 250 pp the crown is worth are far more useful right now.<br/>
Why? Because it doesn&#39;t take THAT much time to get (a few hours off-peak),<br/>
and with  deflation so rampant, a full suit of (small) bronze, a Dirk, and a<br/>
good secondary weapon won&#39;t even add up to 150, which will save you MUCH<br/>
more time than that over the next 15 levels. You can also trade it, even up,<br/>
for a demon claw or a battle drum, both of which are much more valuable to a<br/>
bard.<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s a very nice piece of equipment, but it&#39;s not worth the 50+ extra<br/>
AC and the 50+ extra attack you can get with only *half* of it. Sell it, and<br/>
get one at level 25 when you want another one- or simply buy one. Paying 250<br/>
pp at level 25 is very different from having that amount at 11, even if you<br/>
have to wait a couple of more days.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d personally keep it. If you do sell it, you&#39;ll probably<br/>
&gt; find yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; going to runnyeye in 10-20 levels to go get it again. It may not seem<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; useful right now, since you&#39;re not fighting that many spellcaster, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that&#39;ll change pretty quickly. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d tend to concur.  The crown is a very nice item.  250pp may<br/>
&gt; &gt;seem like a lot at your level, but it isn&#39;t really that much<br/>
&gt; &gt;later on.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still a sizable sum in<br/>
&gt; &gt;your mid 20s, but it&#39;s &quot;I just have to save up for it,&quot; not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;m never gonna be able to afford that.&quot;  Most folks in their<br/>
&gt; &gt;30s tell me they have over a thousand pp and nothing to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt;it on (I&#39;d be close to that except I&#39;m spending it on small<br/>
&gt; &gt;steel plate).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You should be able to trade the crown for a nice item if the<br/>
&gt; &gt;+resists don&#39;t really get you excited (I don&#39;t think they help<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards as much since we get a whole slew of resist raising<br/>
&gt; &gt;songs that are more effective than the spells).  Like maybe a<br/>
&gt; &gt;battle drum.  :-)  The crown is just into the difficult-to-<br/>
&gt; &gt;obtain range where high level folks will make trade-only<br/>
&gt; &gt;trades for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The crown is on my L28 bard&#39;s list of items I&#39;d like to have<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re curious how desirable it is.<br/>
&gt; =================================================<br/>
&gt; I concur with John<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am level 35, and I JUST got the Blackened Iron Crown. It is<br/>
&gt; GREAT. I spent<br/>
&gt; hours at this level with another friend camping the King. Got the<br/>
&gt; Grotesque<br/>
&gt; Mask about 4 times before we got the crown. Then, I left. I didn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; feel bad, as I didn&#39;t get ANY XP for the whole venture, and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t see ANY<br/>
&gt; other groups come in and complain. I got what I needed, and took off. No<br/>
&gt; farming for me, thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, the crown is sweet. AC 5, +5 STR, and +5 to all resists. Man, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; REALLY nice!!!  Keep it, you won&#39;t be sorry!<br/>
