 </span></blockquote>Well, what&#39;s worse - a bard/druid/shaman getting jboots, or a<br/>
guild getting them for their second, third, or fourth<br/>
characters?  As things stand, the most desirable items are<br/>
monopolized by those with higher level characters (usually too<br/>
high for the mob), almost to the exclusion of others.  I have<br/>
three paladin friends, and we spent well over two weeks trying<br/>
to camp for ghoulbane.  But most of the time we had to hunt<br/>
elsewhere because a bunch of level 45-50 non-paladins were<br/>
camping the spot because they&#39;d traded away their last<br/>
ghoulbane and &quot;needed&quot; another.  (Their excuse was that<br/>
everything else in the L40-50 areas was camped.)<br/>
<br/>
When the player-to-player trade (or twink) aspect of an RPG<br/>
starts to interfere with the adventuring aspect, something is<br/>
wrong.  After playing this game, I&#39;ve decided a &quot;shows up only<br/>
a few times a day&quot; system is really stupid when a mob that&#39;s a<br/>
challenge to you is a pushover for someone else, and there&#39;s<br/>
no system to enforce taking turns.  I think a better system<br/>
would be to allow each character to loot each special mob once<br/>
in a lifetime, and put lower level looting limits on the mobs<br/>
(to prevent the use of mules).  No more kill stealing for nice<br/>
items, no more harvesting to trade/sell on EBay/twink, no more<br/>
camping the same place for a week (and blocking out others) so<br/>
your entire guild can be outfitted with the rare item, and no<br/>
more having to wait 3 days for a rare mob to show up.  The<br/>
&quot;rare&quot; mob could always be there, and rarity of an item could<br/>
be determined by how frequently he drops the booby prize.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, as you get some of the nice continuous effect<br/>
songs like invisibility or levitation, you will wish you had a<br/>
pair of jboots.  My friends have started poking fun at me<br/>
because I&#39;ve been asking for SoW a lot lately.<br/>
