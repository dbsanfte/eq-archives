<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037245079">I had an unusual thing happen last nite.  Our guild leader was trying to<br/>
make my wizard an officer in the guild and could not.  Does anyone know why<br/>
this might have occurred?  I was in the same zone as him and already a<br/>
member.  My bard is also an officer in the guild, but we have at least one<br/>
other member who has two officers in the guild on the same account.  Has<br/>
anyone else encountered this problem?  I tried zoning, camping, etc. all to<br/>
no avail.  No matter what we tried he could not make me an officer.  He was<br/>
able to make other people officers after trying on me however.<br/>
