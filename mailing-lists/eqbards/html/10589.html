<div id="ygrps-yiv-427328177">Great story!  Welcome! <br/>
<br/>
Your technique is great for where you are fighting and getting good xp.  But<br/>
let me just point out that there are other situations where you can&#39;t use<br/>
Area Effect songs.  If you camp the treehouse in KFC (Aviak Villiage in SK),<br/>
you may find out like I did that AE will agro the birdies that spawn on the<br/>
ground underneath you and they are able to attack you some 100 feets<br/>
straight up.  This is not to say that you cant be an all instrument bard<br/>
there too but you need to adjust your song selection to meet the needs of<br/>
the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and Keep us posted!<br/>

		Hello Fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
		   I have been reading this page now for about a month,<br/>
posted one letter, <br/>
		but never saw it, (I think my hotmail account ate it) LOL.<br/>
But this board <br/>
		has really helped me a lot.  I am a Bard on Bristlebane with<br/>
22 songs (3 <br/>
		times now).  After reading a lot of stuff on how youll use<br/>
instraments <br/>
		instead of weapons, I wondered if it would realy work.  I<br/>
was not sure. <br/>
		But last night in Oasis I did the DDD, COD, HYMM, LARGO<br/>
BINDING with out <br/>
		using a weapon, and I now for the first time feel like a<br/>
Bard.</div>
