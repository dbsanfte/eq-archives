<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694453647">Hey!  That was you!  I knew it started with an O, but I was honestly so<br/>
disgusted with my guildmates ridiculous antics I couldn&#39;t think straight.<br/>
That&#39;s the first time I have ever just camped from a group without so much<br/>
as a see ya later.  I did warn them beforehand and told the other poor<br/>
unfortunate caught in their stupidity I was leaving.<br/>
<br/>
Hey on a side note Olgwinn, do you, or anyone out there in fact, know what<br/>
level the scorponids in The Overthere are?<br/>

&gt; &gt;And if we could convince Faras and Aloro to join the fold we would have <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the E&#39;ci bards on this list within three guilds:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in Militia these days, and we have at least 4 high-level bards.  <br/>
&gt;Myself,<br/>
&gt;Guibu, Vasen, and Valeyardb.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as we&#39;re counting E&#39;Ci bards, make sure to throw me in the pot with <br/>
the rest of them...  =8^)   I&#39;m in the Crimson Legacy guild.  I think I&#39;m <br/>
the second-highest level bard in the guild (other is a level 45-50 something<br/>
<br/>
bardess that doesn&#39;t seem to be on much) and I&#39;m level 39.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my winning personality and skill (or lack thereof) as a<br/>
<br/>
bard that seems to have inspired a small run of twink bards in our guild...<br/>
<br/>
BTW Kitasi, that was me that said &quot;Hey, It&#39;s Kitasi from the eqbards list!&quot; <br/>
that day in Overthere...  =8^)<br/>
