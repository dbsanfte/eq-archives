<div id="ygrps-yiv-866342490">I wasn&#39;t saying you&#39;d have much of a chance to interupt, just saying that&#39;s<br/>
the common reasoning behind wielding two different delays.  Personally, I&#39;ve<br/>
been using pixie to interupt and have had outstanding success with it. ;-)<br/>

Even by lvl 20 your chance of interuping a caster with a single hit is real<br/>
small (non PVP).  MOnsters (rightly so, otherwise they would be WAY too<br/>
easy) have insane channeling skill.<br/>
