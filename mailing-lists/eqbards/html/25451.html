<div id="ygrps-yiv-541064748">I have a level 29 druid and i am gonna buy some stuff for my bard and i was<br/>
wondering what kind of stuff should i get<br/>
    I think i was a 1 hs and a peircing weapon but not sure<br/>
    Also i might buy banded armor<br/>
    What is a good BP for me to get<br/>
    And is there any class specific armor that i should buy?<br/>
Thanks for helping me out...<br/>
