I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us <br/>
from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>

&gt;I just came across this thread in whineplay, which I think all of you should<br/>
&gt;take a look at.  Evidently there has been a change to the mechanics of bard<br/>
&gt;song on Test:<br/>

&gt;It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>
&gt;while AFK.  The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;, and<br/>
&gt;has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>
&gt;putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard if<br/>
&gt;we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep one<br/>
&gt;song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
