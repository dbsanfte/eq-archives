<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798514929">Hmm...I think you may be waaay optimistic on some of those.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Lavastorm = No - I think they&#39;ll crank up the xp modifier for Najena, and<br/>
make it worth being bound in FP for the light races to take the risk.  Other<br/>
than that, it&#39;s too close to Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
South Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines away.<br/>
Yes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>
normally nobody in there.<br/>
<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron = No - Gfay and Kaladim are both close.  Kedge would<br/>
probably get a small xp modifier boost, and Unrest an even larger one, to<br/>
entice the lower levels to try, who have a harder time travelling Dagnors.<br/>
<br/>
OOT = Unk - Could go either way.  Due to only being able to zone by boat,<br/>
the arguments are strong in either case.<br/>
<br/>
Lfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>
pathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>
xp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite it&#39;s<br/>
faults.<br/>
<br/>
Feeroot = No - Only 1 zone away from Cazic Thule.  Too close.<br/>
<br/>
Innothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>
midpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some type,<br/>
with light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>
zones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>
proximity to Lguk.<br/>
<br/>
All of Odus = No - Between Erud for the lights, and Paineel for the darks,<br/>
nothing needed.<br/>
<br/>
N Ro, S Ro, E Commons, W Commons = No - Proximity to FP, Neriak, High Pass,<br/>
and Rivervale.  Especially if my Innothule prediction is borne out.  :)<br/>
(Befallen is avoided, not because of binding issues, but because it&#39;s a<br/>
death trap with little reason to try.)<br/>
<br/>
Everfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>
aligned folks can bind in Halas.  Fixing Permafrost will also help, though.<br/>
:)  Might as well be named Permatrain, as it is now.<br/>
<br/>
Kunark and Velious - I just don&#39;t have enough knowledge of these zones.  My<br/>
Kunark is limited to FV and LOIO, with some FM thrown in, and my Velious is<br/>
limited to Frankel the Pirate in N Ro.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Someone with some free time should maybe keep up with the predictions (I<br/>
would, but I don&#39;t have the free time...hehe..honest), and once the points<br/>
go in, see how we did.  :)<br/>

Here&#39;s my guesses...<br/>
<br/>
Very likely:<br/>
Lavastorm (outside Solusek & Najena)<br/>
South Karana (outside Paw)<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
Ocean of Tears (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
Lesser Faydark (outside Mistmoore)<br/>
Feerott (outside Cazic Thule)<br/>
Innothule Swamp (outside Guk)<br/>
<br/>
Not so likely:<br/>
Toxxulia (outside Paineel)<br/>
Erud&#39;s Crossing (at docks)<br/>
West Commons (outside Belfallen)<br/>
Everfrost (outside Permafrost)<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Evulia of Tunare<br/>
