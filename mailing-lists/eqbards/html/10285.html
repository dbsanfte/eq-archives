<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027789925">I do find myself in 5 casters 1 Bard party&#39;s more than I care to think about<br/>
and they all can&#39;t wait for me to hit 32.  (I hit 29 twice last night :)  I<br/>
have too many friends who are wizards and mages and not enuf tanks/healers.<br/>
The last several levels I have become all too aware of the importance of a<br/>
good tank in the party AND I KNOW that it&#39;s NOT me.  : )<br/>

 &gt; party (all the<br/>
&gt; bards singing clarity)?  It would be interesting to see just<br/>
&gt; how much mana<br/>
&gt; the wiz could cruise through.<br/>
