<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403352048">I would not count on the Plane of Hate being a cure-all for high-level zone <br/>
overcrowding. As Brad said recently to a group on the Fear Plane that the <br/>
Plane of Hate will make the Plane of Fear look like a newbie zone.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &quot;During last night&#39;s event, the Plane of Hate &#39;opened up a gate and <br/>
&gt;let<br/>
&gt; &gt; forth it&#39;s minions&#39;.  It is not open as yet, however.  This is just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; preview of things to come.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am almost sure that the plane is open for two reasons.  A GM mentioned<br/>
&gt;that the plane is open and the fact that Fennin Ro server has already<br/>
&gt;travelled to the zone.  Hopefully I am right, as it is due time that they<br/>
&gt;gave the level 50s somethign to do so they can level us level 20-30 alone<br/>
&gt;in our dungeons =)<br/>
