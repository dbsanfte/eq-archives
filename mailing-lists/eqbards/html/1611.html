<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026296443">There seems to be spots in zones that you can&#39;t get to.<br/>
<br/>
I was destroyed by a train in CB once, about 10 half elven feet from the<br/>
exit... Upon getting back inside and playing the locating corpse song, I<br/>
kept being pointed into a wall ..... Anywhere I stood, it was the same<br/>
wall... Behind which I could not get to... After petitioning, the guide<br/>
teleported me BEHIND the spot where you zone from CB back into Greater<br/>
Faydark...  There was a bend (which you can see, just not get to from CB)<br/>
and voila, there was my corpse.  When I walked back towards the zone spot, I<br/>
zoned into Greater Faydark, even tho I was coming from the other<br/>
direction... seems the map continues and they put an &quot;boundry&quot; in the middle<br/>
that makes you change zones.  Makes sense since this would make walking<br/>
towards that boundry more realistic.  (seeing it continue) I know I&#39;ve been<br/>
caught offguard by the zone when approaching the zone boundry, east to west<br/>
commandlands comes to mind.<br/>
<br/>
This body could have been in the zone, just on the other side of the zone<br/>
boundry.<br/>
<br/>
If you petition they should help you get your body.... And if you let them<br/>
know that you were trying to help this other guy and got caught in the wall,<br/>
they might even reimburse you your lost exp.  They&#39;ve said they&#39;d do this if<br/>
you died to a bug.  (getting them to do this might be another story.)  : P<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; In my experience if you target a player with no corpse in the zone, you<br/>
&gt;&gt; get the same message saying that you sense a corpse in this direction,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but it does not actually turn you in any direction. Maybe you were<br/>
&gt;&gt; already pointing in that direction, and just though it was pulling you?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; In this particular case, I was facing inward on the dock when I<br/>
&gt;started the song.  I definately got turned around when I got the &quot;You sense<br/>
&gt;a corpse&quot; message.<br/>
