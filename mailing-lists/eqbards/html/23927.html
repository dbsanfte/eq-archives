<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295150877">Here&#39;s what a friend of ours said about the two classes he&#39;s played:<br/>
<br/>
[The paladin] is lvl 54 now with 128 days played and well over 18 <br/>
months of hard core gaming. Sure he died quite a few times and many of them<br/>
before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days with very little<br/>
exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand has officially<br/>
passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, 4 of those<br/>
camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, which cutts exp<br/>
in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go from 1 to 54 for a<br/>
necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the pally. How can this<br/>
be right?<br/>
*********************<br/>
It&#39;s not just bards that have issues. I will really hate the loss of mezzing<br/>
and CCing things and see it as a major impact on my ability to contribute to<br/>
group survival/success.<br/>
