<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000511213">You could also try such songs as Lullaby when you see the poor fellow<br/>
being attacked by more than one mob.  Or any of the other slow the mob<br/>
down songs like Melodic Binding.  The difference from Druid, Cleric and<br/>
Shaman spells is the fact that most people fail to see that you are<br/>
actually helping them.  Do they notice the mob is bound by strands of<br/>
music?  Not really, but it is still gratifying to do the deed.  Who know<br/>
if they noticed, who knows if they will ever help you?  Instant<br/>
gratification isn&#39;t there , but you never know where kindness can come<br/>
from =).<br/>

&gt; Use bellow without making an attempt to melee the monster at all, and only once<br/>
&gt; the person fighting it has it around half life. Also stand aways away. It is<br/>
&gt; generally very clear you are assisting without trying to steal it. Also<br/>
&gt; remember that all people see is &quot;[monster] reels in pain.&quot; so like most of our<br/>
&gt; songs, they have very little idea what we are doing. I also use consonant chain<br/>
&gt; to help others in the same manner.<br/>
