about 10 seconds.  Dunno, maybe charisma has something to do<br/>
with it.<br/>

I used it to break up the king area in Permafrost solo.  The<br/>
first time I tried it, I&#39;d lamented all the mobs on the floor.  <br/>
I fought an elite guard down to below half health when a<br/>
newly-spawned priest above us started healing it.  I charmed<br/>
the elite and ordered it to attack the priest, only to watch<br/>
in horror as it decided the shortest route to the priest was<br/>
through all the floor mobs.  Of the four remaining floor mobs,<br/>
only the patriarch (who was actually the most recently<br/>
lamented) was activated by the guard&#39;s passage.  The rest were<br/>
still lamented.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the guard, patriarch, and priest were enough to<br/>
do me in.  :-P<br/>
