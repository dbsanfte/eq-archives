&gt; Um. On Solusek Ro, at least, Phoenix was one of the first guilds in Sol B.<br/>
&gt; For a long time, it seemed, no one wanted to go in. Phoenix helped to make<br/>
&gt; it &quot;safer&quot; by learning the zone, what dropped there, etc. And now its<br/>
&gt; popular.<br/>
&gt; So they went off and found other places to hunt (though I guess some still<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; there)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At least at the beginning, however, Sol B did not seem to be nearly the<br/>
&gt; popular<br/>
&gt; dungeon it is now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The change in popularity happened when charm was taken away from pc and<br/>
npc shaman. Before that, Sol B as very deadly, even more so than Lower<br/>
Guk. Before that, on our server, if you went there it was only a matter<br/>
of time before your tanks got charmed and a chunk of your party was<br/>
wiped out. Removing charm from them made the dungeon majorly easier than<br/>
it was before and once that happened it became popular fast.<br/>
