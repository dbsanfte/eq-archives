<div id="ygrps-yiv-472403350">Since you apparently are a person who has been PK&#39;d, I have some questions<br/>
about how PK works.  Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>
that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>
worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>
Percentages, etc.  <br/>
also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>
player?  Items?  Money?  Nothing?<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is the wrong forum for theses questions, but dang it, I&#39;ve<br/>
been curious.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; bah ,,,  I&#39;m back to wearing a rawhide tunic now because I was pk&#39;ed by a<br/>
&gt; DE<br/>
&gt; wiz last night in HHP ,,, funny how they wait until 4 orcs are beating up<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; me ,,,,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am thinking about going back to full leather instead of banded ,, I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; just keep my armor in the bank until I need it again .....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the weight is killing me,, I only have a str of 80<br/>

&gt; Lvl 19 Half Elven Bard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; p.s.  if you are wondering how I got p.k.ed ,, it&#39;s because I am crazy<br/>
&gt; enough to play on the pvp server.  NO,,, I&#39;m not a pk ,, I belong to an<br/>
&gt; anti-PK guild ,,, I ,, along with most of the other people that play on<br/>
&gt; Rallos Zek ,, believe that it is the true RP server ,,,  what is the point<br/>
&gt; of dark and light races without a race war??????? and the ability to kill<br/>
&gt; each other ,,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when you start out on the pvp server ,, it&#39;s pretty rough ,,  I was killed<br/>
&gt; about 20 times before I made lvl 3 and left the newbie zone ,,,,  but ,,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; gets better ,,, you still get PK&#39;ed ,,, but it adds a little realism to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; game..<br/>

&gt; &gt; Part of that is because some bards (namely ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; that don&#39;t read this list *smile*) don&#39;t give our class a very good<br/>
&gt; &gt; showing. They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; also may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; L20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good example My level 9th Bard (with no twinking) is currently wearing 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; pieces of banded. a level 20 in PW is ridiculous.<br/>
