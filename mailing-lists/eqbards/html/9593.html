it!<br/>

It nearly completely light in there!  WTF? Man I needed some spell to cloud<br/>
my vision!  Granted I do got  my clipping plane set to max viewing distance<br/>
but come on now - this is ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
Ugh - ugh  - ugh what are they doing??<br/>

It used to be one of the most totally scary zones we had.  Even if there<br/>
