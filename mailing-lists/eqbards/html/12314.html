<div id="ygrps-yiv-60387519">I&#39;m not certain how charm works in PvP but perhaps the reason the charm<br/>
against the pet didn&#39;t work was because you and the magician were grouped<br/>
together. Someone else will have to confirm if charm will work against a pet<br/>
as long as you aren&#39;t in the same group.  Of course another option is to<br/>
charm a nearby mob.  You&#39;ll just have to make sure to keep recharming it<br/>
otherwise you will be facing three opponents instead of two.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of other pointers I can give you.  Never duel someone you are<br/>
grouped with.  I did one time (friendly duel) and I discovered the hard way<br/>
that when I weaved the heal song, my opponent also benefitted from it.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t think of this beforehand but we both laughed about it afterwards.<br/>
Another thing to be concerned with when dueling a magician is his damage<br/>
shield.  You will want to equip slower weapons that do more damage versus<br/>
light weapons with a fast Delay rating.  If you dual wield fast weapons like<br/>
thulian claws and a dragoon dirk, you will find that you hit so often that<br/>
the magician&#39;s fire shield will do a lot of damage to you.  If all you have<br/>
is fast weapons, perhaps the best course of action is to take him down with<br/>
DDD and CoD using instruments.  You didn&#39;t mention if you were weaving<br/>
Elemental Rhythms or not.  Since a lot of the magician&#39;s spells are fire<br/>
based, I would make sure I had this song up all the time.    <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of<br/>
&gt; dueling.  While I was running my mouth, the magician I was with challenged<br/>
&gt; me to a duel.  We were the same level (29) and I said what the hell.  He<br/>
&gt; had a fire elemental pet that was blue to me so I decided that the only<br/>
&gt; way I would stand a chance would be to try to charm him into fighting his<br/>
&gt; pet.  Well, let me just say that I thought charm was only nerfed on the<br/>
&gt; PvP servers and NOT in PvP mode.  Wrong!  So I start the duel with the<br/>
&gt; thought of charming him.  Hit the song, and wait, and wait, and wait... no<br/>
&gt; pulse! WTF? So I try charming his pet that is now attacking me.  Resist,<br/>
&gt; resist, (thinking cool, its pulsing, gonna work), charm sticks but no<br/>
&gt; charm! Instead I got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39;<br/>
&gt; Dammit! NOOO!  Meanwhile, I am getting the hell nuked out of me while<br/>
&gt; trying to figure out what to do next.  So I die.  I pop back up and my<br/>
&gt; opponents health bar is down (still grouped) and I hear &#39;Beat, Demi is<br/>
&gt; getting the sh*t kicked out of him.&#39;  Come to find out, after looting my<br/>
&gt; corpse, that after I died, his pet agro&#39;d on him.  Strange charm bug is<br/>
&gt; what I am assuming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone on the list dueled a magician or a caster with a pet and won?<br/>
&gt; He was a really cool guy and I asked him for a rematch some other time.<br/>
&gt; My new tactic is just like how I would fight a wizzie, below him to death.<br/>
&gt; His pet wasn&#39;t hitting to hard and I think I can solo his pet by melee and<br/>
&gt; songs.  So, I think I can take him by just staying on his butt and keeping<br/>
&gt; his spells interrupted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any other suggestions?  I am also assuming that Screech won&#39;t work either.<br/>
