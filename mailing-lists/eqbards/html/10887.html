&gt; bunch and they killed em off to break the spawn.  After that - the SK ran in<br/>
&gt; to the water and dragged em up one or 2 at a time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was doing those dw&#39;s the other day with my regular group on the<br/>
Tribunal. I used harmony (I&#39;m a L40 druid on Tribunal now, my bard on<br/>
tarrew marr is on vacation) and was easily able to pull singles for a<br/>
while. Unfortunately I had the bright idea of moving the fight<br/>
underwater so we could get used to underwater fighting for our planned<br/>
trip to Kedge. Also unfortunately, one of the people we&#39;d added to our<br/>
regular group wandered (swam) a bit too close to the tower while we were<br/>
fighting one I pulled and we got 4 on us. Everyone lived but me, who got<br/>
cast on by 4 of them after healing our tank. But, it is doable. I think<br/>
just our regular group of 4 40&#39;s could have done it if someone hadn&#39;t<br/>
blundered into agro range. <br/>

&gt; p.s. only other DW pull - a ranger swam into the cave and tried to pull.  He<br/>
&gt; went LD.  His pal went down to cast EndureBreathe on him (not realizing that<br/>
&gt; you cant cast/heal/buff LD players) and somehow he died - also LD. Oh well -<br/>
&gt; back to something safe - killing Ogers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What level are the Ogres? I&#39;m always looking for out of the way spawns<br/>
to fight when things get crowded.<br/>
