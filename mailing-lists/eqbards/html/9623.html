<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-452695307">me experienced? it took me a month about to get out of that stupid level!<br/>
<br/>
my suggestion is kill gnome guards with a druid or a wizard, they&#39;re great<br/>
xp.  Kith forest seems nice too, though carefull trains and casters. Other<br/>
then that, stick to smaller groups for better xp.  Im pooched though, other<br/>
then 1 wizard in our guild, the rest of them are all 39+ so lotsa levels<br/>
above me.  But if you&#39;re a hardcore camper and think you can keep your<br/>
sanity, you can go to the gnomes with a full group at around 30-32 and stay<br/>
there till you solo em for xp at 48.  a druid friend of mine stayed there<br/>
from 37 till he hit 49 (i went from 32 to 35 in 1 week there just cause he&#39;d<br/>
log me in for mana so he could kill more of em). <br/>
<br/>
if you&#39;re good at charming, charm the 2 at the gates against each other and<br/>
kite em around the druid gate. i&#39;ve been lucky now and then and was able to<br/>
kill the victor with chain/fear. <br/>
