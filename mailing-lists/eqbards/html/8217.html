<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887100154">Sorry to have to post this to the list.<br/>
I went to the link for the survey, and it said there<br/>
were no active surveys. Please tell me that I am not<br/>
doing something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
About the clothes on women thing. I laugh at my ranger<br/>
friend because when we die (happens a lot), she comes<br/>
back wearing MORE clothes than when she is fully<br/>
dressed in her banded armor. Oh, and not all of the<br/>
women are eye catching. I personally have never looked<br/>
twice at a female ogre, troll, halfling, dwarf, or<br/>
gnome. :) <br/>
<br/>
I play a female high elf enchanter as well, and I have<br/>
had my share of harrassing remarks. I have been<br/>
proposed to, as well as propositioned. I try to<br/>
disregard the bad remarks (made easier by the fact<br/>
that I know I am not a female IRL). But the times when<br/>
people walk up to me and praise my beauty is a lot of<br/>
fun. :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for now.<br/>
