<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624666065"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; 	My usualy strategy for this, is to make those 2 the most important.<br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words, I&#39;ll try and do 3 songs, but if I miss a note on anthem,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll skip it and restart 1st MR song, then 2nd MR song, then try Anthem<br/>
&gt; &gt; again.  Or if I miss a note of 2nd MR song, restart 2nd MR song,<br/>
&gt; &gt; go back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1st MR song and repeat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to try this, but in my parties, which are usually tank heavy, so<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; is flying by in the chat window that I&#39;m already at information overload.<br/>
&gt; Maybe I should turn on some of those filters...  Nah, I can&#39;t stand to<br/>
&gt; miss<br/>
&gt; something :-).  It wouldn&#39;t be the same if I didn&#39;t throw in that &quot;Nice<br/>
&gt; Crit!!&quot; comment here or there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Ahh.. I got tired of the melle spam, and usually have mine turned<br/>
off.  I do believe you get crit notices with Other&#39;s Hits - Off.  So you can<br/>
avoid the melee spam and still comment on the crits :)<br/>
<br/>
	Course missed song notes are a different color from hits and misses,<br/>
plus I play in window mode, so all the text shows up nice and clearly<br/>
anyway.  I&#39;ve actually gone back to seeing hits (not misses), but seriously<br/>
thinking of turning it off again, mainly cause I just feel silly.  <br/>

	Ranger slashes for 25<br/>
	Ranger slashes for 17<br/>
	Monk hits for 15<br/>
	Monk hits for 15<br/>
	Monk hits for 23<br/>
	Monk hits for 19<br/>
	Monk kicks for 15<br/>
	Bard tries to pierce, but misses!<br/>
	Bard pierces for 3<br/>
<br/>
	etc.  <br/>
<br/>
	After even the pets started seriously outdamaging me, I turned it<br/>
off, just so I wouldn&#39;t think about it :)<br/>
