<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926449019"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No Song:  170 sec         standard<br/>
&gt; Jig singing:  149 sec     12.35%<br/>
&gt; Jig with drum 138 sec   18.82%<br/>

&gt; I did this test twice just for some repitition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you did some timed test. I always thought that it did speed up<br/>
mana regen, via my own untimed testing (but when your medding time is 10<br/>
minutes, you notice a minute change). Other people suggested it was just<br/>
confusion between the client and server, however this didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>
case as casting snare didn&#39;t cause any larger than usual decrease in the<br/>
mana bare (next to none).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I intend to meet my shaman buddy with my 20+ level bard and do similar tests<br/>
&gt; to see if level, singing ability, percussion ability make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll do the test myself, with a friend who is a lvl 31 bard. I&#39;d test my<br/>
own lvl11 bard but I only have one EQ playable comp.<br/>
