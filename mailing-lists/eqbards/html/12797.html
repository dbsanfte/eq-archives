<div id="ygrps-yiv-316355175">I&#39;m not sure about your case but I&#39;ve been able to get a guild listing of<br/>
more than 2 zones. My guild is often spread across the entire continent and<br/>
I always get everyone who is not RP or anonymous, often from at least 5<br/>
zones.<br/>

Doing a who on guildmembers does not work reliably.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of guildmembers in my /friend list, and even though they aren&#39;t<br/>
anonymous, and show up when I do a /w all friend, they do not show up when I<br/>
do a /w all &quot;&lt;various permutations of guild&gt;&quot;.  It seems like only a maximum<br/>
of 2 different zones are listed, for some reason.  Say 2 members are in<br/>
Feerroth, 2 are in Oasis, and 1 is in North Freeport.  I&#39;ll get a listing<br/>
showing the 2 in Feerrott, and the 2 in Oasis, but the one in North Freeport<br/>
will not show up.  I haven&#39;t done diligent testing on this, but it always<br/>
seemed like that was the case.. I&#39;d do my /w all guild, and only people in 2<br/>
zones total would be listed.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; For doing a guildwho I believe the correct syntax is /who all &quot;&lt;part or<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; of guildname&gt;&quot; so for you to get it to work with &quot; Order of the Sacred<br/>
Nut&quot;<br/>
&gt; it would be /who all &quot; order of the sacred nut&quot; maybe?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for zone name who&#39;ing, you would still be stumped by anyone who was in<br/>
&gt; RP mode or is anon since the zone info wouldn&#39;t show up in the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good Journey<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] A new /who command (OT)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here is an idea I posted on alt.games.everquest newsgroup.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The few replies<br/>
&gt; &gt; it generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think<br/>
&gt; &gt; and maybe it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The command would<br/>
&gt; &gt; work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells<br/>
&gt; &gt; you who all is in<br/>
&gt; &gt; that zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by<br/>
&gt; &gt; adding this<br/>
&gt; &gt; /who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is too hard to code.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Comments?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been wanting something like this for a long time, and I agree with<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; justifications as to why this would greatly help the game. Ultimately,<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; performs the same parsing as any other &quot;/who all XXXXX&quot; command, so I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t think that this is all that more complicated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ideally, they could make this &quot;who&quot; command a bit more powerful by<br/>
allowing<br/>
&gt; us to essentially &quot;grep&quot; the &quot;who all&quot; command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my guildmates for one of<br/>
&gt; the guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me that there was a<br/>
&gt; &quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For Windleaf, who belongs to &quot;Guardians of the Divine Light&quot;, I can find<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; of his buddies with a &quot;/who all guard&quot; command. But the other guildname<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t work as the GM had to tweak the name, so the guildname is &quot; Order<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the Sacred Nut&quot; (it&#39;s meant to be funny :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Notice the space character in front of the name. This screws up any chance<br/>
&gt; for me to see who else in this guild is logged on, but was the solution by<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the GM since there was another &quot;Order of the Sacred (something)&quot; on the<br/>
&gt; server and the server only recognizes the first 16 characters according to<br/>
&gt; the GM. So she added a &quot; &quot; in front of the name. At the time I didn&#39;t<br/>
argue.<br/>
&gt; (Believe me, it&#39;s a real long story).<br/>
