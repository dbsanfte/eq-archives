<div id="ygrps-yiv-623361674">The &quot;quests&quot; in PoA are basically scavenger-hunt type of things.  You accumulate the 3 or 4 items required<br/>
for the trade-in, trade them in, get the item.  The final item for all quests is VERY rare.  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
Sky 6 times (cleared it through the Eye the last two times) and we&#39;ve only found the final item for one of<br/>
the Bard items twice (the Flute), none for any of the other Bard items.  And those we only found because<br/>
we were farming the Spiroc Lord, using a technique that is arguably an exploit, and which we do not use<br/>
anymore.  You should make a list of the items (castersrealm has one) that are required for the Bard items,<br/>
and carry a good weight-reducing bag (those components weigh a ton, like 5-25 pounds apiece), then hope<br/>
for a good roll if a rare one drops.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how far you&#39;re likely to go.  Sky takes a lot of planning, and some very specific tactics on<br/>
each of the different islands.  Best bet is to listen to the raid leader and hope he knows what he&#39;s<br/>
doing.  Your role as a Bard is pretty straightforward, buffs/resists/regens.  I always ask &quot;what kind of<br/>
magic do we expect from this MOB&quot; pretty much anywhere I go, anyway.  I look like an ignorant doofus, but<br/>
I end up singing the right stuff (and the others who were too chicken to ask the question appreciate it).<br/>
So just ask if they aren&#39;t telling you.<br/>
<br/>
Expect to die a lot.  Ask in advance if you need to bring cash up.  Bring up some extra jaspar and peridot<br/>
(the Clerics and Enchanters will appreciate it) and tiny coffins if you have the bucks (don&#39;t admit you<br/>
have the coffins unless it becomes obvious that you&#39;re going to sit on your heinies for a couple of hours<br/>
without them, they&#39;re too expensive, hehe) (this assumes you have a Necro along of the appropriate level<br/>
to use them - 57 I think).  A properly organized raid should be correctly supplied beforehand, but my<br/>
guild seems to fall short on that score.  Sigh.<br/>
