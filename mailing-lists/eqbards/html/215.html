&gt;Simple answer . . . you can&#39;t sing more than one at a &gt;time.<br/>
&gt;To figure out why, trying singing Happy Birthday and &gt;Three Blind<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I must say I agree with this. Though I am as yet young and unskilled in<br/>
the arts of the bard, I find it difficult to sing two songs at the same<br/>
time. I tried singing two songs the other day, and people threw<br/>
vegetables at me! Mind you, I was actually grateful, as I was very<br/>
hungry, but I don&#39;t think this is the reaction I would desire on a<br/>
regular basis. <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone understands quite what I am saying.<br/>
