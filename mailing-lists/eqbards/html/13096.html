<div id="ygrps-yiv-637489087">This doesn&#39;t surprise me. I know that the little hamburglars in Misty<br/>
Thicket always have a small round shield, a spear (12plat I think), a silver<br/>
ring, and a squad ring (Not the same as the quest item though). A co-worker<br/>
who plays an ogre spent some time there and he got this off every one of em.<br/>
No vendors for him to sell to so he junked most of it, especially the rings<br/>
which were lore.<br/>
	Oddly enough one of the rings had +5 CHA and said it was useable by ALL/ALL<br/>
but it can&#39;t be equipped on any part of your body...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Here&#39;s the kicker though.  Every bouncer we killed dropped a standard long<br/>
sword and round shield.  These are regular store bought items.  Because they<br/>
are regular store bought items, when you sell them to a merchant, you get<br/>
more PP for them than you do FS weapons.  I got 9PP for every long sword and<br/>
I think 5PP for every shield.<br/>
