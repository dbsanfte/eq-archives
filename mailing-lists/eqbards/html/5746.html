&gt; Man how the heck do we get a song to stick to anything thats level 45 or 50<br/>
&gt; then? As it is I need mobs debuffed to make things like Chain stick to them<br/>
&gt; everytime without fail. How did you do as a 50th Bard? Did the skill cap<br/>
&gt; effect your resistance level? Do I have to start using instrumenets with<br/>
&gt; those songs that need them now to boost there power a bit?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if resist is based on instrument skill or not. I do know<br/>
that bellow (though I rarely use it any more) still goes up in damage<br/>
the usual one point every 2 levels after 40 and so does the heal song<br/>
hp/tic. I do know that my exp trying to chain a L50 mob at L49 was that<br/>
about one in 5 or less would stick. It was funny to chain and fear the<br/>
Allizesaur or whatever it&#39;s called, but it sure wasn&#39;t something you<br/>
could rely on working. He is level 50 and it took our party of 6<br/>
L47-50&#39;s a long time to kill him. We had to have an SOW&#39;s warrior run<br/>
him around the island while our magic users medded back up to full. But<br/>
that&#39;s the monster balance in this game. A L50 mob cannot be taken down<br/>
by a full party of near L50 players. Which is why most L50&#39;s are dying<br/>
of boredom or playing other chars now, as there&#39;s really not much to do<br/>
unless you can get multiple parties together.<br/>
