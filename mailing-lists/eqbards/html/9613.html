<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611503098">I don&#39;t see how this applies to Kithicor?  Careful planning should guarantee<br/>

&gt; &gt;What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See, I am totally from the other school - I have no fun if I AM scared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, not on a continuous basis at least - that is the difference<br/>
&gt; between a<br/>
&gt; &#39;game&#39;, and immersing yourself into a world. Humans cannot create<br/>
&gt; societies<br/>
&gt; based solely on danger - and this is one lesson Verant refused to learn<br/>
&gt; from other games they studied. They did learn the one about setting one<br/>
&gt; group of players up to be fodder for another group - but went just a tad<br/>
&gt; overboard in some areas overcompensating with monsters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I for one am NOT amused when I am out happily gathering silk - or hides -<br/>
&gt; to be wacked in the back of the head by a sand giant or griffin.<br/>
&gt; If I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a hope of fighting back - thats not fun, thats not scary,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s pking<br/>
&gt; via monster. Death may be an inconvience at most - but I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like to<br/>
&gt; die - for starters - it tends to break the fantasy - I will avoid death<br/>
&gt; whenever possible by cautious hunting and careful planning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got like 40 days on my bard played - and only lvl 23 - don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; particularly care if I EVER get to lvl 50 - my main goal in life<br/>
&gt; was not to<br/>
&gt; be jumped by everything and it&#39;s brother while I was going about my normal<br/>
&gt; business. And yes - my bard can outrun most of this stuff - IF I don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; disconnected (which happens to me with annoying frequency - 6 times<br/>
&gt; yesterday). I also play an enchanter a bit - we as bards may be fast - but<br/>
&gt; a lot of classes don&#39;t have that kind of native defenses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was in Oasis last night with my enchanter - having ubermonsters (to low<br/>
&gt; levels) in the mix also provides the perfect material for high level grief<br/>
&gt; players to work with - was getting trained by specters on the average of<br/>
&gt; every 5 min - for about an hour and a half. Petitioned and<br/>
&gt; petitioned - did<br/>
&gt; a /who all gm - one GM and about 4 guides all on their asses in the plane<br/>
&gt; of air.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play safe - and I pick my battles - I just don&#39;t like idiots being given<br/>
&gt; the tools to do this, or being blindsided by something in an otherwise low<br/>
&gt; level zone that I can&#39;t even scratch. Guess I don&#39;t find running for my<br/>
&gt; life scary OR fun.<br/>
