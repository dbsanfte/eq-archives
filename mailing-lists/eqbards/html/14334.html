<br/>
   If you feel the need to post my private messages to you on this list<br/>
   again (and make it look like I posted it to the list itself, instead<br/>
   of where it really went, which was your personal mailbox), I am going<br/>
   to suggest you be removed from the list.<br/>
<br/>
   That is one thing I cannot tolerate.  I would be much more careful<br/>
   in the future for your own benefit.  Much more careful...<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.</div>
