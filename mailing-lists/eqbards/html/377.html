<div id="ygrps-yiv-80917758">Easy fix.<br/>
Since the 2 original continents were in the south here is a viable solution.<br/>
Add a zone entrance to steamfont.  Maybe another one out the back side of<br/>
Ogook or something.  Anyway in this new zone would be a boat dock to take<br/>
people to the new lands.<br/>
If you were in a mixed group, people using old and new versions, everyone<br/>
would hit the zone entrance and recieve the Loading Please Wait message.<br/>
<br/>
Those with the New updated versions would successfully zone into the dock<br/>
and be able to cross to the new lands.<br/>
<br/>
Those with the older versions would zone back to the main zone and recieve<br/>
a message saying.  Sorry you must purchase the Everquest Upgrade pack to<br/>
gain entrance to this zone.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the group is split it would show a dark red bar of health for all<br/>
those that were not in your zone.  Communication should still be possible<br/>
since that dosen&#39;t require new monsters or zone graphics.  See easy fix<br/>

&gt;This is a good point - you can&#39;t really cross the expansion with the regular<br/>
&gt;release. My _suspicion_ is that they&#39;ll either have new servers available<br/>
&gt;(requiring a new character) or they&#39;ll have a port for your existing<br/>
&gt;characters to the new game environment. It isn&#39;t reasonble to mix the two<br/>
&gt;into one server. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone else have any ideas?<br/>

&gt;I really only have one concern with the expansion, and that is that it<br/>
&gt;is an optional expansion. This mean that there will be people I am<br/>
&gt;playing with that don&#39;t have it, right? Now what does this mean? I am<br/>
&gt;pretty certain that Verant spoke about adding new creatures, and<br/>
&gt;possibly races, and who knows what else (spells, items). All of this on<br/>
&gt;top of the more than likely two new continents. How is this going to<br/>
&gt;affect the gameplay? What if I, playing with the expansion pack, and<br/>
&gt;partied with someone without?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess there really isn&#39;t an issue as long as the expansion doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;add new races. All of the new zones, creatures, etc could be kept to<br/>
&gt;the new continents. But what about the boat to get there? Would someone<br/>
&gt;without the expansion not see it? Would they be magically barred from<br/>
&gt;entering it? I&#39;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it<br/>
&gt;will all work great when it comes out, but these are questions that I<br/>
&gt;will have nonetheless until then.<br/>
