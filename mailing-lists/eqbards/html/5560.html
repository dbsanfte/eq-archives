<div id="ygrps-yiv-55740445">Well there&#39;s an update to my corpse recovery story.  When I logged in tonight<br/>
the guy showed up a couple of hours later looking for his corpse.<br/>
<br/>
I was less tired and feeling a bit more magnanimous so I helped him swim to<br/>
the zone and go deep-sea diving for his corpse.  Still without Aquatic Ayre,<br/>
even though I&#39;ve hit 16th (haven&#39;t bought the song from High Keep yet).  Well<br/>
it worked.  The guy had a set of leather, a few coins and a Bloodforge Hammer.<br/>
But it meant a lot to him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it worked out and I feel a bit better about myself and boosted the<br/>
reputation of bards in general I hope.<br/>
<br/>
The guy said &quot;thx&quot;, disbanded and ran off.  That&#39;s gratitude for ya...<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;The last time I saw this guy he was understandably upset, but swimming<br/>
&gt; offshore to look for his corpse in the direction that I gave him.  Believe<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; I wished him well, but I couldn&#39;t put my character in that potentially<br/>
&gt; disarterous position.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How would others have handled this situation?  Given it&#39;s midnight, and you<br/>
&gt; plan on logging within an hour or so and there&#39;s no bank on the island.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That happened to a guild member and good friend of mine.  We both agreed<br/>
&gt; that it was ridiculous to try to swim all the way to the zone.  He<br/>
&gt; /petitioned and explained that he was killed on the boat and the corpse was<br/>
&gt; dumped when the boat zoned.  The guide kindly summoned his corpse for him,<br/>
&gt; since it was where it was through no fault of his own.<br/>
