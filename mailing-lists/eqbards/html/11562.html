<div id="ygrps-yiv-639599012">But in those cases, they ALWAYS work if they are equipped and never if<br/>
they aren&#39;t. The DE illusion is not necessarily something you want<br/>
to ALWAYS work when you have a piece of armor on. (Or it could have<br/>
something to do with illusions dropping when you zone. You do not<br/>
lose armor when you zone, or have to put it back on. But the servers do<br/>
not pass illusion information from one zone to the next. Just character)<br/>
