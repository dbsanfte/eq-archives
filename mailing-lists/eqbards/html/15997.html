<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331491573">I&#39;ve got a 20th level unarmed combat warrior in AC and my wife has an<br/>
Archer.  Everyone told me how archers ruled, but I disagree.  My warrior can<br/>
go through 3 times as many monsters and do just as much damage as her buffed<br/>
archer.  Of course I am also now level III Item and Creature magic and have<br/>
a BD4 Katar to her BD3 Yumi (I know, greek to the EQ&#39;ers).  But alas, there<br/>
are flaws with AC, all of which have been well documented here.<br/>
<br/>
We like to describe EQ as ICQ on steroids and AC as a single player game<br/>
where there is not a lot of inter-player interaction (not relative to EQ).<br/>
Sure you get say and tell, but you loose ooc, shout, auction and guild<br/>
say...  AC is relatively quiet compared to EQ.<br/>
<br/>
In a lot of ways AC did it better and I REALLY like the fact that the world<br/>
is so HUGE and so expandable.  I can&#39;t imagine them ever having an over<br/>
crowding situation like we live with in EQ.  It is all relative though.  I<br/>
find it so humerous when I hear a beta-AC guy telling me about how AC is<br/>
soooo over crowded because there are 2 people in a dungeon that used to be<br/>
empty and those are maybe 2 of the 6 people you see that night hunting...<br/>
They all would hate EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad someone can&#39;t combine the best features of both games and make a<br/>
nice hybrid.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Last year I tried out Asheron&#39;s Call beta and really hated it.<br/>
&gt; The graphics<br/>
&gt; &gt;sucked, the interface was kludgy etc.  So when final came along<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; &gt;the game.  I was totally un-impressed.  Needless to say my tune<br/>
&gt; has changed<br/>
&gt; &gt;now.  I tried it out this past two weeks while I was on a<br/>
&gt; business trip...<br/>
&gt; &gt;All I can say is &quot;I&#39;m impressed&quot;.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the nitty<br/>
&gt; &gt;gritty but I&#39;ll post some of my impressions that I got from the past 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;weeks....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I picked it up last weekend when it was $25 at Best Buy.  To answer the<br/>
&gt; recent question: yes, you get a free month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; fixed, why<br/>
&gt; &gt;it was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The detail in the update reports did impress me quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most verything else you pointed out was pretty nice, too (landscape<br/>
&gt; graphics, dynamic world, skill sets, less paranoia of players<br/>
&gt; advancing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the character appearance, though, I have to agree with another post I<br/>
&gt; saw somewhere: it&#39;s a nice idea, but you rarely ever see people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; faces, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a lot of design effort gone (mostly) to waste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>
&gt; &gt;reported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; &gt;single bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, this is what killed it for me:<br/>
&gt;  - no secure trading (did they never play Diablo?  how long ago was that?)<br/>
&gt;  - no banking (everything is on your person, or on player named<br/>
&gt; &quot;Will&#39;s Mule&quot;)<br/>
&gt;  - the first-person mouselook is entirely unusable.  There&#39;s no mouse<br/>
&gt;    acceleration setting, and the horiz and vertical are fixed at entirely<br/>
&gt;    different settings, so turning is slow, but your head keeps snapping up<br/>
&gt;    to the sky or down to the ground.  Then, if you move forward and try to<br/>
&gt;    turn while running forward, it _stops_ and does the turn, and you have<br/>
&gt;    to press &#39;forward&#39; again.  Entirely, utterly, unusable.  You have to<br/>
&gt;    play the game third-person, with the keyboard, which completely kills<br/>
&gt;    any immersion factor for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I&#39;m not entirely convinced on the better support from listening to<br/>
&gt; players; I&#39;m sure these have been reported over and over since the beta<br/>
&gt; started, and are pretty major design flaws IMHO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other things I&#39;ve heard about but didn&#39;t get far enough to see:<br/>
&gt;  - no group health display<br/>
&gt;  - unbalanced heavily towards magic and archers, and against melee<br/>
&gt;  - no guards, so people can have fun pulling monsters into the town square<br/>
