&gt; was suggested by someone else on<br/>
&gt; this list, is to give the item to<br/>
&gt; a mob and then kill the mob to loot<br/>
&gt; the item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t work anymore,<br/>
&gt; unfortunately. Since the latest <br/>
&gt; patch, I think.<br/>

freeport. The item you get from him for a quest was able to be given to a<br/>
