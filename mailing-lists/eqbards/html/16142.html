<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-219204529">Well, it seems I&#39;m just full of questions :┬¼ )<br/>
<br/>
These days I see many young bards walking around looking like the inkies I&#39;m<br/>
so fond of killing in Najena and Mistmore. I, however, never had the time to<br/>
go sit in Lower Guk and wait for a drop. (not to mention I didn&#39;t exactly<br/>
know where the room was)<br/>
<br/>
Well, now the story is a little different. I expect to make 32 tonight, and<br/>
with it to be accepted whole heartedly into any group. :┬¼ )  Ok, maybe not,<br/>
but it should help and make me a little more valuable to a high level group<br/>
than I was before. That being said, most of the people I spoke to said the<br/>
ghoul assassin is mid 30s in level, so I was thinking of going to earn my<br/>
mask the old fashioned way.<br/>
<br/>
So here are my humble questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>
the assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several maps, but they<br/>
are all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there are ladders<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>
common loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>
from the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>
since it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>
curious.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
