<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675244577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; In keeping with the latest theory, what is your charisma?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh geez, I must be one messed up bard =).  I actually played a monk<br/>
through most of beta and started a bard towards the end.  I have 85<br/>
charisma.  When creating my character I was under the false assumption<br/>
that Dexterity and Agility made up you armor class.  Which grossly<br/>
incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Neat I am shocked that someone has actually read it to some extent.  Most<br/>
people checkout my character and never even care about it.  For me it has<br/>
been frustrating to get this roleplay going.  I have tried to emote and<br/>
hint at it all the time.  Most people never notice or even care.  I had a<br/>
couple friends who role played about it with me and that was perhaps the<br/>
most fun I have had in the game.<br/>
<br/>
As for my location, I have been spending that last few days in Lesser<br/>
Faydark or Unrest.  The loot on the bandits is good for the wallet and the<br/>
experience in Unrest is quite decent if not perhaps good.  Unfortunately,<br/>
unrest has become a mad house overrun with people.   Anyways hope to see<br/>
you arround.  BTW are you a half-elf female?  I thought I saw you last<br/>
night, buit before I could confirm the name you camped and blinked out of<br/>
existence.<br/>
