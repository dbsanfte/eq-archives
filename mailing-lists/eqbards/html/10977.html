<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-502129274">You can&#39;t put level limits on items, it&#39;s silly.<br/>
<br/>
If somone really wants a high level item and they are willing to save up<br/>
for it then let me, just because people are twinkers doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
genuine low level people have to be affected.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re always coming across the high levels giving items to low levels but<br/>
there is nothing wrong with it. Take the Lord of the Rings - Bilbo hands<br/>
Frodo the mithril tunic and the dagger &quot;stinger&quot;.<br/>
If there was a level limit it&#39;s like saying - Bilbo hands frodo the Mithril<br/>
tunic and the Dagger &quot;stinger&quot; but the gifts can&#39;t be accepted because<br/>
Frodo is too low a level.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to twink then let them, when I started EQ I started a<br/>
Wood-Elf warrior, got to level 11 and didn&#39;t like it. My friend and I who<br/>
both started at similar time (he was also wood-elf warrior) so we twinked<br/>
the low level stuff we had made (various banded and some bronze etc), and<br/>
at the time I thought I was a bad twinker. But now I know it was harmless.<br/>
<br/>
Leave it alone I say, I love the game the way it is.<br/>

when you have a level 30 Mage that can Malice it. The song were resisted<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think ALL the quest armor for all the classes should be NO DROP.<br/>
<br/>
And I think items should have level limits on them.  If they can put a<br/>
limit<br/>
on procing, they can put a limit on being able to hold/wear an item. &quot;You<br/>
feel as though the magic within this item would overwhelm you.&quot;  not<br/>
necessarily all &quot;powerful&quot; items, but a lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
of course, this will never happen. :)<br/>
