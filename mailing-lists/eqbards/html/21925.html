<br/>
I am a programmer in the mutual fund industry (as is Kit btw).  Most<br/>
managers I worked for would put the date-reported on their bug list.  We<br/>
would produce &quot;Aging&quot; Reports showing not just the severity of the bug<br/>
(perhaps 1-10 or High Medium Low).<br/>
<br/>
The best manager I worked for would automatically bump the priority up one<br/>
level for any bug that sat on the list for more than 3 months.  So he<br/>
expected even a trivial bug to be fixed within 6 months (and usually lows<br/>
were things like a heading not centered properly on a report).<br/>
<br/>
As far as the Tambourine - I&#39;m very happy that they added the graphic for<br/>
it - but keep in mind the animation is still just as bad.  I was admiring my<br/>
two new pieces of armor I got last night (traded the 3 wurmslayer scales for<br/>
Singing Steel Gloves and got a Hero&#39;s Bracer) - watching the animation.<br/>
With the Tambourine - you basically are shaking it in a strange spot in your<br/>
left hand - and playing air guitar on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Verant - professional musicians can play instruments - so we don&#39;t<br/>
play air guitar...<br/>

time the issue was outstanding. The NRC is very interested in cycle times.<br/>
The point was long cycle times says the management of the facility was<br/>
lacking in commitment and efficiency, and would get a plant on the Watch<br/>
list as fast as a real incident. Gaming is not nuclear power of course, but<br/>
the same indicators apply to any industry.<br/>
