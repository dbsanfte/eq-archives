&gt; &gt; Sonorus Clouding does not work in Lower Guk, that is why it would be useful<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have at level 39, you won&#39;t be needing to go deep into L guk until this<br/>
&gt; &gt; level so it&#39;s about the right time to get it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Down there John, you explained it, however what you<br/>
&gt; explained does not equal your answer.  Our invis song<br/>
&gt; works against undead of just about all but see invis types<br/>
&gt; and the ones in Lower guk. That is not a need for invis to<br/>
&gt; undead but a fix for the Lguk zone.. Or a clarification as<br/>
&gt; to what they are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have tested with those who have invis to undead and<br/>
&gt; standard invis.. Clouding -IS- invis plus invis to undead.  <br/>
&gt; There is just a quirk with Lguk<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll repeat my earlier comment on this thread.  Whether or not<br/>
your invis on a type of mob seems to depend on your level.  I<br/>
suspect our invis is really (invis) + (invis to undead - 10<br/>
levels) or something like that.  Clerics and paladins could<br/>
cast invis to undead to roam inside Unrest rather early on,<br/>
which my song didnt&#39; become effective until the low 20s.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, then our invis does not work in LGuk by<br/>
design.<br/>
