<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498667386">Flash of light is a mega taunt, I call it my cleric taunt.  I use it all<br/>
the time when i helping out lower lvls and sometimes in my regular when<br/>
I am trying to spread out the damage.  (Our warrior does a great job of<br/>
taunting, and between him and our bard, I almost never even get nicked)<br/>

&gt; A paladin friend scoffs whenever he hears about others who can&#39;t taunt<br/>
&gt; mobs, and swears by flash of light as a spell that taunts better than<br/>
&gt; taunt.<br/>
