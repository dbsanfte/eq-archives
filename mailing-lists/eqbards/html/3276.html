<div id="ygrps-yiv-512980678">Try runnyeye - I was with a group of players over the weekend there that<br/>
were no lower than level 21, there are plenty of Goblins there that will<br/>
give you XP at your level, just don&#39;t expect to do that zone solo as the<br/>
Goblins go crazy and round up HUGE trains regularly.<br/>
 <br/>
At level 19 (which is what I was) I died 3 times and ended up leaving<br/>
frustrated because I had less XP than when I started and not gotten a single<br/>
piece of black iron, which was my goal in being there.  It seems that being<br/>
the lowest member of my party, and therefore the weakest, caused me to<br/>
experience the old &quot;monster magnet&quot; syndrome again - should be a good place<br/>
for you though at 22.  I know that on my server there were never more than<br/>
around 20 ppl in the zone at any time during the day and often closer to 10.<br/>
 <br/>
Plus everyone is aware of course that there is a much sought after weapon<br/>
(not going to give away) there that is better than the BBC stat-wise and it<br/>
is the place that blackened iron comes from.  I saw a bard run past with<br/>
selo&#39;s and a drum last night in HPH all dressed in black iron and it looked<br/>
VERY cool - I felt like I had just met Johnny Cash ;-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 22 bard and have caught a snag in my experience gathering.<br/>
Anyone have any good suggestions for me? I have been stuck at level 22 and<br/>
keep going backwards.  I think I&#39;m playing in the wrong zones, but not sure.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
