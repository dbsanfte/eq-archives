<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-883574550">i was wondering if anyone has heard of our imbrued platemail armor being<br/>
dropped in the Plane of Hate yet.  supposedly it was moved there from the<br/>
Plane of Fear, along with warrior, shaman, paladin, rogue, magician, and<br/>
enchanter items.  Boogeymen in PoF definitely drop necromancer armor now,<br/>
but so far no imbrued has been found in PoH on my server.  not that PoH is<br/>
not good for bards, in fact they definitely thought of us here (for a<br/>
change).  so far i have gotten these bard only items in PoH...<br/>
<br/>
Six Note Blade: 1h slashing, dmg11 del25 wt3, found on the Maestro of<br/>
Rancor, looks like a ykesha.<br/>
<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute: +9dex, +15cha, +9agi, also found on the Maestro<br/>
of Rancor, still very forgetful to test its effects, though i think at 25hp<br/>
per pulse sitting with hymn, there is an improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Martune Rapier: Piercing, dmg8 del23 +5str +4agi off a scorn banshee (i<br/>
assumed these banshees would have imbrued, though they have only had rapiers<br/>
so far).<br/>
