&gt; I can vouch for the fact that my cute *female* half-elf Bard got a lot more<br/>
&gt; stuff in her early levels (I *never* asked) than my wizened male gnome<br/>
&gt; Magician or male human Monk.  Sylly can probably vouch for this, and if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not mistaken John(tm)&#39;s character is female as well.  Even though most<br/>
&gt; everyone knows (and I freely admit when asked) that there&#39;s a male playing<br/>
&gt; that character, somehow me as a male gamer is largely separated in other<br/>
&gt; player&#39;s minds from Crier the Bard while playing in that world.  There&#39;s<br/>
&gt; doctoral dissertation material here, I just know it.<br/>

the females flock to him, and he wastes about a half hour a<br/>
night flirting with them.  :)<br/>
