you ARE stealing players from that other guild. If they are not currently<br/>
IN a guild and/or ask you if they can join your guild, then you aren&#39;t<br/>
stealing, it was their choice.<br/>
<br/>
My friend had never expressed any interest in leaving Phoenix, but got<br/>
courted heavily simply because they wanted more bards until she made<br/>
it clear she wasn&#39;t interested.<br/>
<br/>
It is considered exclusive for a high level guild to do raids, etc<br/>
by themselves. Yet here, if you ask others to come along, you are<br/>
saying that justifies creating a new guild with all those people<br/>
in the same guild, and asking them out?<br/>
<br/>
In our case, Phoenix WAS capable of doing planes, and other high<br/>
level raids pretty much alone. We asked people along because they<br/>
were friends of the guild who just happened to be in other guilds<br/>
(there was even an entire different guild that was effectively a<br/>
&quot;sister guild&quot;) but didn&#39;t accept random hangers-on unless they filled<br/>
a slot we needed at the moment (And then, it really seemed to be a<br/>
depends case). AND they got screamed at for not allowing the random<br/>
hangers-on as being elitist, etc.  Sometimes you just can&#39;t win<br/>
no matter what you do.</div>
