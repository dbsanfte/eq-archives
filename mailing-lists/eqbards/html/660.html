&gt;I was wondering if you could give me direction from Freeport to Qeynos?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there&#39;s a few different ways.<br/>
First off go to the Eastern Commons. I like to skirt the south zone wall <br/>
(following the desert mountain) westward.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually you&#39;ll zone into West Commons. Just keep following the south wall <br/>
running west. Watch out for homers though. If you keep following the wall <br/>
you&#39;ll get to zone point for Kithicor Forest.<br/>
<br/>
After zoning into Kithicor, follow the right wall. You will reach Rivervale <br/>
shortly. This is where you have the option of going the Rivervale/Misty <br/>
Thicket/Runnyeye/Beholder route, or you can continue past Rivervale and <br/>
shortly you will reach the zone to Highpass.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exact directions in Highpass to get to the zone to East <br/>
Karanas...I get lost there usually, but if you survive and you look around <br/>
you should eventually zone to the Easter Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the canyon cliff path down to the bottom and head due west. You <br/>
should hit water, head south. You will see a great chain link bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Cross it and you will  zone into North Karanas. Basically in the Karanas you <br/>
just keep running due west, careful to avoid homers and griffons. You will <br/>
zone into West Karanas eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Again, run due west (follow road if you want). Careful to avoid the nasties <br/>
(and stear clear of Choon and Froon and the ogre camp unless you are a <br/>
badass). The zone entry to Qeynos Hills is on the west wall of the West <br/>
Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
The Runnyeye/Beholder route is a little more complicated, but I like <br/>
it...it&#39;s very easy to run through and I&#39;ve personally never had any <br/>
problems, BUT from what I hear I&#39;ve been lucky. Instead of making this <br/>
e-mail longer, if you want to check out that route, I would suggest going <br/>
into Rivervale, and asking for a guide.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
