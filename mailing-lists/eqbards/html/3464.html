&lt;&lt; when you get to lower guk is get yourself a Mask of the <br/>
 Deceiver. This is another bard/rogue equipable items that casts an illusion <br/>
 of dark elf race on you. It also is +9 to charisma I believe, can&#39;t remember <br/>
 the exact stats. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This really interests me , i would like to get one.  I am now lvl 31 and need <br/>
to know if in a full group i could get one , or what drops it. any info would <br/>
be great. if you don&#39;t want to spoil everyone else , feel free to send it to <br/>
me personally.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
