&gt;Hmm, what hand do you use for moving?  The reason I ask is that most folks<br/>
&gt;(I think, maybe I&#39;m about to be corrected) use their numpad for hotkeys &<br/>
&gt;therefore for song weaving.  You want to be able to move around while<br/>
&gt;singing, and I would think trying to use direction arrows and the number pad<br/>
&gt;together would be awkward.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I use the numpad for keyboard movement (I do a<br/>
combination of mouselook and keyboard movement...<br/>
depending on which is easier. In buildings/<br/>
dungeons, the keyboard gives me control) My mouse<br/>
(on the left side of the keyboard, NOT the normal<br/>
right) allows me freeer range of movement<br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use directional arrows because they do not<br/>
give me the look up/down, other options that the keyboard<br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
I use the number keys for hotkeys. Easier to reach<br/>
with the shift key anyway.<br/>
