<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275048891">How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used to<br/>
drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am CST<br/>
in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>
Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>
the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>
the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and the<br/>
guy after him got a Yak.  <br/>
<br/>
The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the top<br/>
of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped the<br/>
room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>
hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>
left.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>
42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>
This is totally absurd.<br/>
