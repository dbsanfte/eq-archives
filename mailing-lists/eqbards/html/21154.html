<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224189574">I made the posts because people were asking for info. I&#39;ve collected a lot<br/>
(both from this list and from other sources) and figured it was worth<br/>
sharing. I covered North Wall break in the second post, which on many<br/>
servers is the prefered method. Most people avoid west wall breaks because<br/>
there are more roamers to deal with.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can think of several reasons. But here&#39;s the best one: not all planar<br/>
groups are comprised of mid 50s folk. It&#39;s easy to forget how much harder an<br/>
approach like that would be for late 40s folk. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, please share your methods for breaking. I would love to read more<br/>
methods and try them out. I would also love to see some guides for breaking<br/>

WALL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uhm, responding before reading the full thread but - this guide is very<br/>
dated.  There are at 3 least other better ways to break PoF.  Some stuff is<br/>
pretty standard planes ops but SW is a great place to LOSE alot of exp with<br/>
multiple deaths if you so desire.<br/>
<br/>
We setup outside PoF - make 4 groups or whatever.  Send in first 2 groups,<br/>
10-20 seconds apart.  They are sow&#39;d and invised and they make a left turn<br/>
and run to the west wall - trying to avoid any agro - fairly easy to do.<br/>
Once they are set, if not agro&#39;d, they can cal in the 3rd group.  By then,<br/>
almost certainly agro&#39;d and fighting.  2 or 3 mid 50 and up groups with<br/>
enchanters can easily handle the break. If they want some help and the route<br/>
from the portal is clear, they can call in the next and subsequent groups.<br/>
The key thing is controlling the amount and rate of agro by controlling then<br/>
number of folks running in. Less is more in this case.<br/>
<br/>
I heard other folks like to run to a north wall camp and others insist a NW<br/>
wall run in is great.  But why run in, die, CR, camp off agro, etc etc etc<br/>
when you can walk in and kill them all?<br/>
