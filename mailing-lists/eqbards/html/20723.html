<div id="ygrps-yiv-100230308">the iksar mask is on a named harbinger in trakanon&#39;s teeth.  you get all the<br/>
named mobs to spawn by continually killing hunters and foragers.  the<br/>
erudite mask (mask of obtenetration, probably misspelled) is somewhere in<br/>
charasis.<br/>
<br/>
also, i heard that the iksar mask does not give you any benefits like the<br/>
dark elf mask (ultravision, some faction changes) other than the illusion.<br/>
i know you do not get their regen and such, and i heard no faction but i<br/>
don&#39;t have one so i can&#39;t say for sure.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know how many factions are in cabilis (i think 4 or so?) but<br/>
whatever Legion of Cabilis is, i&#39;m fairly certain i am warmly as i have<br/>
maxed it many times fighting in sebilis =)<br/>
