&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back when credit cards were first becoming popular, many<br/>
&gt; stores tacked on an extra charge for using a credit card.<br/>
&gt; See, the way credit card companies make money (aside from<br/>
&gt; outlandish interest rates) is that they get a percentage of<br/>
&gt; every charge made on the card - usually 2%-5%.  The stores<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like having to give 2%-5% of their income to another<br/>
&gt; company, so they started charging customers a credit card<br/>
&gt; surcharge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The credit card companies didn&#39;t like that, so they lobbied<br/>
&gt; Congress, and got a law passed banning credit card surcharges.<br/>
&gt; The stores complied with the law, and began giving cash<br/>
&gt; discounts instead.  The people using credit cards still have<br/>
&gt; to pay more, but now everyone feels better about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Strengthening the mobs or weakening the players, the net<br/>
&gt; effect is the same.  The only difference is one of perception.<br/>
&gt; What you suggest will make players feel better about the game,<br/>
&gt; but it won&#39;t make a functional difference - the game will<br/>
&gt; still be more difficult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
