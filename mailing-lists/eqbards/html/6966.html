&gt;I don&#39;t mean this as a dig to anyone in particular but this is a great list<br/>
&gt;and I really think we should all work hard on refraining from calling one<br/>
&gt;another&#39;s ideas stupid or silly.  We have over 300 members in our list and<br/>
&gt;about 10-20 who post regularly - that means we have a lot of lurkers and we<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t want people to be afraid to speak up for fear of being berated or<br/>
&gt;belittled for their opinion.<br/>
<br/>

On a bardicly related note, I am collecting ideas for a petition, and in my<br/>
opinion, the two best so far that haven&#39;t been addressed elsewhere are<br/>
&quot;party-effect&quot; on Libretto, and rearrangeable spellbook.  BTW, I&#39;ve already<br/>
heard from Brad on that one - it would require INCREDIBLE amounts of<br/>
programming that they can&#39;t do right now.  *hrm* Oh well.  We can look at<br/>
other stuff, and &quot;remind&quot; them that we still want to rearrange our spellbook ;)<br/>
