<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884487937">This is, of course, total crap. Enchanters have a complete lock on crowd<br/>
control at the moment, and at high levels, no one will even consider<br/>
going many places without an enchanter in the group because you just<br/>
can&#39;t pull less than 4+ mobs to break the area. And guess what, there&#39;s<br/>
not enough enchanters to go around, never has been and probably never<br/>
will be. Every other class has other classes that can fill in doing the<br/>
same job, if not quite as well, as their class, but lullaby isn&#39;t a weak<br/>
entrance, the secondary resists make it a useless one. Why do enchanters<br/>
get exclusive rights to one function? By your logic, enchanters should<br/>
have never been given clarity, which was once only available from bards<br/>
with their song, as it would devalue bards and there would be no need<br/>
for them.<br/>

&gt; I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>
&gt; is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>
&gt; would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>
&gt; will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>
&gt; to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>
&gt; than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>
&gt; song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>
&gt; make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>
&gt; mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge sledgehammer<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>
