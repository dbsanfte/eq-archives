<b>Subject:</b> RE: Skill Caps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955162256">there was a long letter compiled by i believe Elwyn on one of the onelist<br/>
bards lists, not sure if this one.  it started from Elwyn, then everyone on<br/>
the list gave input, and it was revised 2 or 3 times and sent in.  we got a<br/>
response about a month later.  i used the word petition, but it was more<br/>
simply a letter.  i think if we were to have a follow-up letter, the skill<br/>
caps should be included.  if we were to add parry as a skill we desire, we<br/>
should also note we do not expect it to cap anywhere near what other melee<br/>
classes get, but more along the lines of our dodge skill (125 i believe).<br/>
also, perhaps GZ can finally put to rest the jig/mana recovery issue.  if he<br/>
says it&#39;s bogus, that is something we can really use for the naysayers.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Regarding the petition - I had thought Shada said there was a <br/>
&gt; petition with <br/>
&gt; skill capping as one of the items to fix. I was corrected. I <br/>
&gt; know there have <br/>
&gt; been petitions and letters sent to GZ and such, but I haven&#39;t really <br/>
&gt; participated in any of them as of yet. Normally I just <br/>
&gt; feedback any opinions <br/>
&gt; i have on the game, but even as a write one I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; wasting my time. <br/>
&gt; If anyone has a current petition why don&#39;t you add the skill <br/>
&gt; cap and ask <br/>
&gt; parry to be added to bards on it. =)<br/>
