<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018519030">I agree that that this shouldn&#39;t impact current TP type issues.  The horse<br/>
ride thing would have a fixed start and end-point - whereas a TP only has a<br/>
fixed end-point (you can launch a TP from any location - the spell only<br/>
determines where you end).<br/>
<br/>
The main problem is fitting it into the current engine.  It&#39;s clear they<br/>
won&#39;t radically re-engineer the engine (didn&#39;t add races or levels to the<br/>
Velious expansion).  I think a slight modification to your idea - make it a<br/>
stagecoach.  They could simply take the code for their boats - have a<br/>
stagecoach station instead of a dock - and basically make it an overland<br/>
boat.<br/>
<br/>
They could make it a flying carpet or some other such graphic as well..<br/>

I have given a decent amount of though to the repercussions of the &quot;horse&quot;<br/>
idea.  I don&#39;t think it would affect druid&#39;s and wiz&#39;s too much.  They would<br/>
not take the place of boats (which I hate too, but thats another story).</div>
