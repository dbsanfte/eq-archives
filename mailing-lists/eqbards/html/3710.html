&gt; Well i was almost positive that it gave me an xtra 4hps per <br/>
&gt; tick with hymn,<br/>
&gt; however another bard of the same lvl tried it out and said it <br/>
&gt; didnt. So i<br/>
&gt; might have been getting confused with the natural healing rate, its a<br/>
&gt; little tricky to judge sometimes with the server actually <br/>
&gt; *dropping* your<br/>
&gt; hps below what the client software thinks it is. So when the <br/>
&gt; servers come<br/>
&gt; back up i plan on doing some testing. I hope im right, but <br/>
&gt; its starting to<br/>
&gt; look like i am wrong. :(<br/>
