<div id="ygrps-yiv-921666996">This occurred to me even at lower levels.  II never understood healers that<br/>
right after a combat would fire off all their mana full healing party<br/>
members then sitting down and medding.  Sub-32 I always sang the heal song<br/>
in downtime and most healers seemed to always heal players one at a time to<br/>
full - instead of rotating around and letting all players get benefit of the<br/>
song.<br/>

Another point about Clerics and Heals...my clerics (it sounds so possesive<br/>
doesnt it?) have learned to wait on healing up the less banged up members of<br/>
the party until they have medded to full mana.  The health regen is quite<br/>
impressive when I am singing the lvl 55 cantana with the 7 string lute in<br/>
hand during downtime, especially if another group regen spell is active on<br/>
the party.  Why should a cleric burn mana on a party member that will regen<br/>
up over the same time it takes the cleric to regain his mana to a &quot;Ready&quot;<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
This is just another way of reducing downtime that we have discovered, but<br/>
one which less experienced clerics and groups do not recognize.<br/>
