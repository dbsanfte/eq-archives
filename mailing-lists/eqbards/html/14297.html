<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584202045">Let me say that I agree with you 100 percent on the testing bit.  They don&#39;t<br/>
test in a competent manner, but at the same time they claim to.<br/>
However, I want to say something about the perception that they are ignoring the<br/>
large issues in favor of the small ones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently working on a fairly large data warehousing project, with a fairly<br/>
complex ETL (extraction/transform/load) structure.<br/>
<br/>
I have a list of changes that need to be made.<br/>
The system is in production.<br/>
The data used will F up the financials if I screw up.<br/>
<br/>
What do I do?  What would YOU do?  I make the small safe changes first.   Tweak<br/>
a field value, change a calc.  No structure changes, no multi tier changes.<br/>
<br/>
Things as a whole get slightly better, my list is shorter.  I still have large<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
How do you solve large issues? What&#39;s the solution to issue X?  Who does that<br/>
solution hurt unintentionally?  How long does it take to get a workable<br/>
solution?<br/>
Can you even get one with no downsides?  I&#39;ve almost NEVER solved a complex<br/>
issue with no drawbacks in a complex system.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have a team working with me.<br/>
<br/>
What do we do?  Some folks make MANY small changes fairly fast.<br/>
Some folks work long hours for months on EACH large issue and fix them slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these things happen at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I know most of us are programmers/data specialists/IS folks, etc.  And as mad as<br/>
we are, you know that in the real world this is how things work.<br/>
<br/>
Add to this that we have NO idea what the code ramifications to change are.  For<br/>
all I know, the same module that controls spell X also produces cascade data for<br/>
mob behavior Y.  With a zillion spells and a zillion mobs, making ANY structural<br/>
or rate change can be HUGELY time consuming, even to track the effects, much<br/>
less implement the change.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant has dropped the ball in several cases.  Are they a bunch of<br/>
Keystone Kops with no clue?  I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Complain away about specific issues, that&#39;s the only way to get them fixed.<br/>
<br/>
But nobody on this list really knows enough about the code or dynamics to call<br/>
Verant incompetent.<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 cents, having been there...<br/>
