<div id="ygrps-yiv-493735035">&quot;Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a bit confused with this message. I thought all of our songs <br/>
had the same duration of 18 seconds before and that charm lasted 18 seconds <br/>
prior to the patch.<br/>
<br/>
Now I notice that after I charm a creature, I can have 3 pulses of selo&#39;s <br/>
before charm wears off. Do you think that they meant that charm&#39;s duration <br/>
was increased from 18 secs to 24 secs?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, checking my logs (should have done that before) I can see that my <br/>
charm sometimes last as long as 23 secs, so I think their message was <br/>
indeed incorrect and our new charm duration is approximately 24 secs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to thank the many bards who put in their suggestions of <br/>
lengthening the duration of the bard song. I made the same suggestion and <br/>
was pleasantly surprised to hear that a lot of other bards had the same <br/>
idea. This will help those who are in groups reacquire the target. It <br/>
definitely helps us higher level solo bards sit and med a bit so that we <br/>
can charm kite longer.<br/>
