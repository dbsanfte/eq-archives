Yes, I too have a problem with this.<br/>
Jsut because you can &quot;kite&quot; a giant doesnt give you the right to train it<br/>
through people and then say ,&quot;Well, they should have moved&quot;<br/>
I have had this done to me on Spectre isle, with the spectres, as I was<br/>
hunting Gargoyles.<br/>

Ok - I saw the most disgusting display by a bard I&#39;ve ever seen yesterday.<br/>
Most bards I know are much more people oriented, and will die before they<br/>
endanger someone else - this one got a LOT of folks killed.<br/>
<br/>
In Oasis (and yes, he&#39;s on this list - but I&#39;m not going to name names)<br/>
kiting a sand giant up and down the BEACH for about 30 min.<br/>
<br/>
Please people, if you are going to use this technique - DON&#39;T kite thru<br/>
people - especially lower level folks.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of folks died.<br/>
<br/>
The ones that didn&#39;t die had their gameplay suspended because they had to<br/>
give all their attention to staying out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Of course - in that period of time, he also collected a nice assortment of<br/>
mummies, zombies - assorted other zone trash in the train - those actually<br/>
killed more folks than the SG I think.<br/>
<br/>
One simple way I could think of to have avoided this problem is get sow and<br/>
levitate cast on you - and kite OVER the dunes - not in the flat areas<br/>
where folks hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem with a member of our own<br/>
class engaging in behavior that is so intrusive of others? It&#39;s bad when I<br/>
do something dumb and endanger myself, or my group - endangering bystanders<br/>
is just unforgiveable in my book, especially when it&#39;s unnecessary.<br/>
