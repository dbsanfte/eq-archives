<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790764571">Ok, here&#39;s the deal on Carillion.  If you don&#39;t have line of sight, it sometimes won&#39;t work.  As it says<br/>
in the various song analyses, All this does is Give you the factions that the mob you targets has  This<br/>
can have various effects on the /con.  Most of the time, this will improve on how they view you.<br/>
Sometimes, however, you can have better or the same faction with them already.  Other times, the mob has<br/>
no faction, like gypsies, so the song does nothing.  This song will not make a monster who is &quot;ready to<br/>
attack&quot; you non-aggro.  It has been debated whether using a wind instrument has any effect on this song.<br/>
My opinion is that it doesn&#39;t.  Quite a useful song, and my feeling it is more useful in getting and<br/>
completing quests (ALL quest giving mobs have some kind of faction) than in changing prices.  Though it<br/>
had allowed me to interact with vendors that normally would not have.  Enjoy.<br/>

&gt; I am camped in FP right now, and I&#39;ll make a real effort to test this<br/>
&gt; out this weekend.  I had a nice load of bronze weapons to sell so I went<br/>
&gt; around trying to see who would give me the most money already though.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it was one of those always doing the same thing wrong things,<br/>
&gt; where the next time I sit down to try it will be so simple I kick<br/>
&gt; myself...<br/>
