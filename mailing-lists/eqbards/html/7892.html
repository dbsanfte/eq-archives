<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147959411">On the subject of twinking, or at least related to it.  I would very much<br/>
like to obtain a Guise of the Deceiver.  Wait, don&#39;t flame me yet I know its<br/>
No Drop.  I would be willing to accompany a party to Lower Guk if they are<br/>
going there anyhow and pay for the right to loot one off the assassin.  From<br/>
what I understand there are groups hunting him for his rare drop, whatever<br/>
that is, that already have one for everyone in their party.  I haven&#39;t been<br/>
able to find anyone like this on E&#39;ci but my higher level contacts are<br/>
limited.  If anyone is going there and would be interested in minorly<br/>
twinking my poor little bard please let me know.  <br/>
<br/>
There are several quests I&#39;d like to explore and this is the only way I&#39;ll<br/>
get the chance short of retiring my bard for about 6 months to build up an<br/>
evil character.<br/>
<br/>
thank you for your time in this blatant request for aid and assistance.<br/>
