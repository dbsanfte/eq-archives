Bah!  I&#39;m the list newbie and refuse to give up the title!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
At level 10 I wouldn&#39;t advise all-instruments.  At level 12, try Hymn, CoD,<br/>
and Bellow with a mandolin.  It took me a while before this became a more<br/>
lethal combo than Hymn, Warsong, and CoD, but by level 13 it&#39;s a very safe<br/>
way to solo and much, much, much more effective against multiple mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I was soloing two or three blue mobs at a time just recently and found I<br/>
could start a battle at 3 and a half bubbles of health and end the battle<br/>
at nearly full health.<br/>

Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>
certain something that my bard does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>
