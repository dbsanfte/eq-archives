<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628497527">Sorry for the tags, I&#39;m too lazy right now to clean them out. For Xegony<br/>
Slyde I would say 3-5k is fair at your discount. Just one opinion from a<br/>
fellow Xegony Bard, with little in the way of facts to support my position<br/>
:).<br/>

 I did some testing on this.&nbsp; Chant of battle at 51 is 30 str and dex<br/>
with a hand drum.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
With Nostolo tamborine it is 37 str and dex&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
With Walrus skin drum it is 39 str and dex&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Guess that makes it about even with sharksin drum and on eq prices that is<br/>
around 3k.&nbsp; But for the money, I think it would be cheaper to just<br/>
buy your tamborine quest coins and get that.&nbsp; Better graphic too.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>

prices tend to&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
run on the high side...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m probably into gear less than a lot of people - and the drum seems<br/>
only&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
to be marginally better than my current Nestrolo Tambourine - so I it&#39;s<br/>
not&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
worth it to me to tap myself out (on the one hand) - but I would like<br/>
to&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
fairly compensate my friend if I take her up on the deal.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
She&#39;s done some preliminary asking around the server and got a range<br/>
of&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
9-20K.&nbsp; The high end sounds ridiculous to me - I can&#39;t imagine paying<br/>
20K&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
for a Selo&#39;s Drum which is a lot better (however I think there is a lot<br/>
of&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
confusion between the Walrus Skin drum and the Drum of the Beast - ie<br/>
people&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
think the Walrus Skin drum is better than Selo&#39;s) And it&#39;s probably<br/>
very&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
rare at the moment since prior to the last patch - basically no one<br/>
hunted&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
in SG.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Anyway - I wondering what you Xegony folks think a fair (normal&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
non-discounted) price range would be for this item.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Thanks&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
