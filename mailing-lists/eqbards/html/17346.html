<div id="ygrps-yiv-294558643">Well, since Mr. Smedley and company have decided that to protect their own<br/>
backside (see....lies we got away with till some smart users outfoxed us)<br/>
and are putting this in their EULA....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you. You<br/>
also grant us permission to access, extract and upload<br/>
(i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data<br/>
relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine<br/>
interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest<br/>
<br/>
I will no longer be financially supporting EQ in any way, shape or form.<br/>
<br/>
I know what caused it - I know I have neither the technical expertise, or<br/>
equipment setup to do it - but I&#39;ll be DAMMED if I am going to give some<br/>
gaming company - companies that are notorious for hiring &#39;you want fries<br/>
with that help&#39; permission to sniffel around the innards of my PC.<br/>
<br/>
In case the above doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to you - in plain English it<br/>
means....<br/>
<br/>
You give us permission to look at anything WE think we need to inside your<br/>
PC - and upload it to our offices.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know bout the rest of you, but I have a heck of a lot of personal<br/>
information, CC #s, Tax information, etc on the same machine I use for<br/>
&#39;gaming&#39; - and I&#39;ll be dammed if I give them a blank check to poke around<br/>
as they see fit - and ship things of interest back to their offices. Sorry<br/>
- trust only goes so far.<br/>
