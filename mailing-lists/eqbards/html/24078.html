&gt; stupidest thing I have read on this or any list.   Next time you need to see<br/>
&gt; invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>
&gt; when you pulse clouding to see invis.  Or maybe when you are fighting invis<br/>
&gt; mobs in PoA or another zone and have to use your flute so your party can see<br/>
&gt; the invis mob you are fighting.<br/>

like the above look good in writing, in actual practice no one does<br/>
this. For any caster other than a hybrid, the mana to cast see invis at<br/>
L50 comes back faster than you can cast the spell.<br/>
