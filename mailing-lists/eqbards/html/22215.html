<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064291129">Never done either, although my rogue has walked all the way thru Sol A and<br/>
Runnyeye with no risk at 9th level to map them out for future guild outings.<br/>
Of course, none of us would ever train Brass that way if the system for<br/>
using it made any sense.  Why give someone their first usage of a skill<br/>
needing a skill level of 90ish when they only get 18 points in it when they<br/>
train?  Not having a low level song for each instrument is their foul up.<br/>
My brass is still 50+ points behind my other instruments.<br/>

Nah...probably with ALL of us being AFK to train brass skill.  Or all of us<br/>
staying invisible indefinatly without risk...lag not included.<br/>
