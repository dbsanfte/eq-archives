<div id="ygrps-yiv-157516861">That&#39;s cuz drums aren&#39;t that cheap.  They just aren&#39;t.  If drums sold for<br/>
500pp or less then every level ~22 bard would have set.  The RotO might be<br/>
worth a bit more than the drums, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ve seen only ONE set of<br/>
drums on Fennin Ro in the last few weeks that would sell for cash and wasn&#39;t<br/>
TRADE ONLY for rediculous things like Ykeshas.  They were 850pp - I paid<br/>
that for them and would do it again.<br/>

&gt; maybe a drum/armor trade for the robes would be wiser.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Would a Robe of the Oracle be a decent trade for a pair of MM Battle<br/>
&gt; drums?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also anyone on Bristlebane interested in a trade like this? =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think the robe would be too mutch...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The robe go for 1000-1500pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Drum go for 250-500pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Up to you to make the trade...<br/>
