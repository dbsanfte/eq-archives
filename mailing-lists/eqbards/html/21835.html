When used by Abashi, who&#39;s only responce to bards requests for<br/>
definitions of how the bard fit&#39;s into EQ is to say &quot;I think they are<br/>
just fine&quot; is insulting. His thinking that is merely an opinion, and<br/>
previously, he&#39;s admitted he just doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; bards, so it&#39;s an<br/>
admittedly uninformed opinion at best. Of the 5 or 6 L50+ bards that<br/>
were in our guild(s) (we have an alliance with another guild for doing<br/>
high level raids like (formerly planes and dragons) Trakanon, and<br/>
Veeshan&#39;s Peak), 3 are now playing other classes and one other has quit<br/>
the game. The fact that the concerns of the least played class in the<br/>
game at high levels are brushed off with this explanation is pretty sad.<br/>
