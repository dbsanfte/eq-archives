<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024458090"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Your puller goes in, gets these mobs (or any mobs that were<br/>
&gt; &quot;told&quot; about you by the stuck mob).  He is inside their &quot;give<br/>
&gt; up&quot; radius but you are not, so they chase him.  He pulls them<br/>
&gt; to your group.  Eventually, both you and he are inside their<br/>
&gt; &quot;give up&quot; radius, but you are tops on their hate list.  So<br/>
&gt; they all go after you.<br/>

  Basic EQ mechanics at work.  Anything that seems complex is <br/>
  only a subset of smaller less complex things making the siutation<br/>
  bigger or more confusing than it really is.<br/>
