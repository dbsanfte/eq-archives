<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614894016">Okay I have lurked on this topic long enough.  First, <br/>
<br/>
EITHER :Chords is not a DOT per se.  Like all our songs that have continuous<br/>
effect it is a DD at the pulse, <br/>
<br/>
OR: and by the Marrs I hope this isn&#39;t accurate, ALL our continuous effect<br/>
songs use the DOT logic.  If this is true bards will me majorly effected by<br/>
this change should it happen.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is more likely the former that is true, not the latter.  Even<br/>
so there will be one huge effect on bards in groups.  No one has mentioned<br/>
it here, which really surprises me in that we have a great group of clear<br/>
thinkers generally.  I think this issue makes many people jump to attack or<br/>
defend without thought, using emotion as their motivation.  The real problem<br/>
for bards if this change occurs will be in the use of Bellow.  Notice that<br/>
when you bellow a monster they will often seem to rush at you afterwards<br/>
because you knocked them back a bit?  This movement occurs quite a bit in<br/>
most of my group fights, as does the changing of targets by critters.  Now<br/>
since all movement is movement that means that every time a critter changes<br/>
targets or rushes back a bit from a bellow he will be immune to a DOT pulse.<br/>
Now since from what I&#39;ve observed all bard songs pulse at the same time,<br/>
even when started at different times, one would be led to believe that the<br/>
pulse is a universal event.  If that&#39;s the case then every time you Bellow a<br/>
monster will be saved from DOT damage.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem Verant is trying to solve is kiting.  They think its a<br/>
problem, so for the sake of argument lets assume it is for a moment.  The<br/>
major effect of kiting is that it allows you to combat monsters you normally<br/>
could not, with little risk.  The main objective is to put that risk factor<br/>
back in, not to make it impossible.  This could be accomplished very easily.<br/>
If they set DOT&#39;s to only do damage when a monster is within a certain<br/>
range, kiting would still be possible, but more risky.  If they make the<br/>
effective range twice the range of the melee attack of the critter, I would<br/>
think they would achieve their goal.  Sure you could run around with a<br/>
critter on you and kite, but one misstep, one hit tree, one bit of lag and<br/>
the critter will get a swing, proabably a bash, and if he stuns you?  Well<br/>
we all know the result of getting stunned by a deep red, death.  <br/>
<br/>
These are just my opinions on the matter, but in some ways kiting is an<br/>
unbalanced advantage.  If they make it dangerous again maybe that advantage<br/>
won&#39;t be unbalancing, just another advantage.  If they do it wrong, balance<br/>
will definitely be adversely affected.  The biggest problem, as I&#39;m sure<br/>
many of us are aware, of a class based rpg is keeping the classes balanced.<br/>
This is especially true in an environment as complex as this one, that does<br/>
not also have continual vigilance and intervention.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey, just give those giants some rocks to throw and we&#39;ll see how long<br/>
kiting them lasts then!<br/>
Yeah I can see it now...<br/>
<br/>
	Hatar begins to hurl a rock<br/>
	You are hit by a rock for 80<br/>
	You are stunned...<br/>
