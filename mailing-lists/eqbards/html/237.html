<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877215309">Bards can indeed wear plate. I&#39;ve been told that you need a minimum<br/>
strength of 80 to do so effectively. I don&#39;t know if this allows for the<br/>
carrying of any loot since the best thing I have so far is snakeskin.<br/>
<br/>
	I don&#39;t know exactly what the effect dexterity has on hitting notes but it<br/>
seems to have a good effect on hitting creatures. I myself dumped all I<br/>
could in dexterity.<br/>
<br/>
	Songs do not use mana and they will go for as long as you are playing it<br/>
for most songs. There are a few songs that will play for a brief time (one<br/>
pulse) and then stop. These are usually NPC targeting types of songs like<br/>
Lament. Getting stunned, missing a note, or zoning will stop a song.<br/>

Hail, fellow bards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the bard class (figure i&#39;ll play one monday on the new server),<br/>
and had a few questions for you.<br/>
<br/>
First, i noticed that bards can wear plate armor.  How much strenghth is<br/>
required to wear a full suit of plate armor and still run around and be able<br/>
to grab some loot?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard Dexterity has an affect on how well bards play their instruments.<br/>
How big of an affect is this?  Should i max my dexterity to ensure that i&#39;m<br/>
good at playing instruments?<br/>
<br/>
Also, i&#39;ve heard that since bard spells don&#39;t use mana, they can play<br/>
indefinately, is this true?  How does the whole &quot;song&quot; thing work?<br/>
<br/>
I guess these questions probably get asked a lot...  if there&#39;s a FAQ or<br/>
something i could check our, just point me to it...<br/>
<br/>
thanks all.<br/>
<br/>
