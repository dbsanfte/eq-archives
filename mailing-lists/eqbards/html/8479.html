The Mistmoore battle drum is a special instrument.  It will make your Selos<br/>
Accellerando go a lot faster!  15% to 20% ? Noticably faster.<br/>
<br/>
It come from a pretty high level monster in Mistmore - I think (makes<br/>
sense?) Anyhow, since there are not a lot of high level bards and since it&#39;s<br/>
pretty useless to other classes, these drums are either hoarded for those<br/>
who might some day do a bard or given as gifts - handed down from bard to<br/>
bard even.  I got mine at level 30 from Kalvidar who was given it (got it<br/>
given to?) by Lyly - a high level cleric who looted it. (He had a spare so<br/>
he could give it away.)<br/>
<br/>
The merch birdie in SK &quot;Krak&quot; hates me or hate half-elfs or something.  I<br/>
tried all the tricks, charisma song, stand behind and sneak, all of the and<br/>
he still wont sell to me - but he does not have anything special for bards -<br/>
not for any one for that matter unless its some loot sold to him by players<br/>
in SK who wanted cash and dumped a rune or words that were useless to them.<br/>
<br/>
Something you could get would be a mino horn - in fact a mino axe would be<br/>
pretty good for you until you can get a combine or dirk.  Also a giant snake<br/>
fang was my weapon du jour for many levels when I was your age.  Let&#39;s go to<br/>
Beholder (where the minos live) and get you equipped!  They are pretty tough<br/>
so you need some help or need to buy it from the 15 to 20&#39;s who can hunt<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I play on Innoruuk so send me a tell when you are in the game and say hi!<br/>
Look forward to meeting you someday!<br/>

		Hi Im new here. My name is Magnuss from Innourkk. I am just<br/>
lowly level 8 but I have to say this is the most fun I have had in any class<br/>
I have played. <br/>
<br/>
		The question I have I have heard some rumors about special<br/>
instruments. Like a drum that is 3 times better then the one from the store.<br/>
Dose any one have any clue about this? I know when I was in South Karnana<br/>
with my wizard I found at the top of the avik village a store that was on a<br/>
small ledge hidden behind a hut. Seed like it was hidden and might have<br/>
special instruments but I dont remember the names. any ways if you have any<br/>
info pleas let me know :)</div>
