<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565968076">My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has <br/>
inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable <br/>
platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which <br/>
comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some <br/>
responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>
