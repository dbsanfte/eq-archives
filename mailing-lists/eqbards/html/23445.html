<br/>
Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but have you tried to<br/>
get them? PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>
for questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still not<br/>
found yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>
thought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>
get the similar items.<br/>
<br/>
They continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>
that, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>
(role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>
interesting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke for<br/>
them to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the course<br/>
of least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>

<br/>
True.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in PoG is to NOT<br/>
HUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not be, and shame<br/>
on you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; creations.  What are<br/>
you Teir&#39;dal or something? haha<br/>
<br/>
My monk on the other hand is only 2 levels a way from smackin around<br/>
Tunare&#39;s creations, hehe. Must get a silver moon bracer.<br/>
