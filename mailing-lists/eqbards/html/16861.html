<div id="ygrps-yiv-238058086">Ok, it&#39;s time for me to come out and voice that tribunal is THE bard server.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to enter a zone with less than 4 bards. Doesn&#39;t matter what time<br/>
it is or what zone I go to, everywhere I look I&#39;m surrounded by VERY green<br/>
bards in full blubicite.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t bother me in and of itself, other than the fact that I know I&#39;m<br/>
competing with tons of bards to get the nice drops I want so badly. (MM<br/>
drums, lambent quest components, etc) What does bother me is that a large<br/>
percentage of these bards are ultra twinked and don&#39;t know what they are<br/>
doing. I actually met a bard that didn&#39;t know how to twist songs at level 20<br/>
!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway seeing as how there are so many bards I often find myself grouped<br/>
with another bard and I start wondering about song selection. Many of the<br/>
bards I&#39;m with are still playing bellows in thier late 20s and early 30s. I<br/>
find this odd because I haven&#39;t memmed the song since level 23. I was<br/>
wondering when the rest of you removed bellows from the list of songs yu<br/>
regularly mem.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; MM drums on tribunal are generally trade only (greedy caster bastards) but<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most drums on Prexus used to go from 1K to 1.5K.  It&#39;s used to be unusual to<br/>
get over 2K for them.  On the other hand with all the bard twinks running<br/>
around these days, there are probably plenty of bards with 50th level<br/>
characters who wouldn&#39;t mind at all dropping 3K on some MM drums so they can<br/>
run faster.  Heck, most of my best trades came from 50th level characters<br/>
twinking their other character :).<br/>
