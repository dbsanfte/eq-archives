&gt; I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>
&gt; game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>
&gt; hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much<br/>
 </span></blockquote>harder,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>
&gt; playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>
&gt; classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>
spread the damage around quite well.<br/>
