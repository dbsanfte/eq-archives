<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125628516">Fear and Chain work well on blues and white, but not<br/>
real well on yellows, and almost not at all on reds. <br/>
At level 30 I find one of my favorite pasttimes when<br/>
my friends aren&#39;t on is to charm kill hill giants in<br/>
rathe mountains.  Very red.  And I probably take more<br/>
risks than I need to, mainly due to being lazy.<br/>
<br/>
I.E.  Speed song first, find mob, cast any spell I can<br/>
on him without getting close.  Giant chases me.  Run<br/>
towards another giant.  As first giant runs by second<br/>
will hear what a nasty little bard I am and give<br/>
chase.  Charm first (who is still targeted).  Usually<br/>
a couple resists (mixing charm and speed) then one<br/>
holds.  Immediately turn and run AT the giants<br/>
(switching of course to the speed song).  One hits me,<br/>
the other hits him, I may get stunned, but I get out<br/>
of there.  Giants fight, twist one heal, back to<br/>
speed, recharm, speed, heal, speed, recharm, speed. <br/>
At some point I get close to see who the victor will<br/>
be (compare health bars).  Keep the healthy one<br/>
targeted.  Charm, speed, charm, speed, in a circular<br/>
motion.  You have gained experiance.  Run away from<br/>
corspe.  Giant follows, run past giant with super<br/>
speed, loot body before giant catches up (the exciting<br/>
part).  Then look for a healthy giant to get the<br/>
wounded one who&#39;s now chasing me.  Fear chain, yes, I<br/>
could take down cy&#39;s with it, but I&#39;ve never gotten a<br/>
49pp 123gp split off a cy.  Eventually you zone to go<br/>
buy expesive wine in freeport and woo ladies waiting<br/>
on the boat.  All in all not a bad day.<br/>
<br/>
Charmed, I&#39;m sure,<br/>
