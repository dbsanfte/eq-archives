<br/>
By 12, you should have a magic hitter for a weapon. If not, get one asap.<br/>
<br/>
Before you get too old - the raider camp on the river in North Karana just a<br/>
bit east of the bridge to South K.  Lots of them there - so take a big party<br/>
in case you pull all of them at one time.  At 14 I was getting green and<br/>
blue cons.  My 16 friends hardly take the trouble to avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
With a co level friend, 13 & 14, you should have fun on the scareycrows on<br/>
the Miller farm in southern West Karanas.   Also, kill off the WK bandits<br/>
before they become green trash.  They have bronze weps for loots to sell.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, you should be able to take on stuff in the Gorge of King Xorbb -<br/>
muddie minors then elders  and gorge minos - with a friend or two to help.<br/>
I chinged into 15 there yesterday - me and an 18 wizard I met on the<br/>
platform.  He said he could take out anything in the place - I trusted him<br/>
for a while but was pretty nervous. We really had no trouble except finding<br/>
enough stuff to fight.  By 15 you will be wondering why you bothered to run<br/>
on the walls in that place and how come the spawn rate is so slow.  Of<br/>
course a couple of hard whacks from these beasties will help you remember<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the gorge in East Karana, turn right and just up over some hills<br/>
is a fun little village with shops and even a guard - although he is lazy<br/>
and won&#39;t attack all of the monsters. But the traffic pattern is pretty high<br/>
and you can run out and pretty much pick what you want and drag it back.  A<br/>
party of 2, 3, or 4 should be just fine here.  At 15, I think you can even<br/>
solo stuff here.  Just fight off the traffic pattern and watch for the evil<br/>
eyeballs.<br/>
<br/>
West Karana - go for the y-kodis and full kodis - need a helper or 2 and<br/>
you&#39;ll do good.  Also if the Dervs are spawning nicely - you and some<br/>
friends can keep them at bay.<br/>
<br/>
East Karana - there is a terrible snake problem near the N Ro tunnel.  It&#39;s<br/>
your duty to do something about it!  Wear some stuff that is anti-poison!<br/>
Keep Purifying Rythmns playing.  Asp&#39;s are nasty beasties!  By 14, you<br/>
should be able to solo them - having a friend with cure poison really helps.<br/>
Also you can hope for the occasional air-elemental and wisp to go by.<br/>
<br/>
Ghoul - camps - need that magic hitter and some friends but there are 1 each<br/>
in EC and WC and I heard in Nro or is it Oasis?<br/>

		I am finding areas are VERY class specific as far as being<br/>
fun and profitable. I am posting some of<br/>
		my discoveries as I find them to encourage people to explore<br/>
them before they are too easy.</div>
