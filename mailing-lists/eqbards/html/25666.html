&gt; Hi, nice to see this group here!  I just got the EQ Trilogy and <br/>
&gt; installed everything, seems to run ok.  I now have a level 3 Bard <br/>
&gt; with whom I&#39;ve been practicing singing.  He is now up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>
&gt; does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to learn songs?  How <br/>
&gt; do i do that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can sing from level 1. It requires you to buy the songs from a song<br/>
vendor.<br/>
At level 3 you have two songs which is really usefull:<br/>
1. area effect (AoE) dot<br/>
2. battle buff (Chant of battle)<br/>
<br/>
Be carefull about the AOE dot getting close to guards with it running is not<br/>
a thing to do.<br/>
You should also learn about &quot;twisting&quot; which enables you to sing 2 or 3<br/>
songs at the same time.<br/>
It requires some practice to get down, but once learned your group members<br/>
will bow in awe for you :)<br/>

&gt; 800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at higher resolutions the <br/>
&gt; game screen gets smaller.  Mind I have tweaked voodoo3 drivers <br/>
&gt; running in XP so i can use Glide with other games so that could be <br/>
&gt; the culpret.<br/>
