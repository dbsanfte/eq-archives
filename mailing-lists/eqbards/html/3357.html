<div id="ygrps-yiv-383090487">I always get people asking &quot;Do people always look like that in Banded?&quot;<br/>
cause of our beautiful golden Banded Half Elf appearance ), and now with<br/>
Bronze I am beginning to look Like Hermes the Greek god ) surfing along with<br/>
selo&#39;s and my drum<br/>
p.s. since when can we not Forage? bard&#39;s get it a level 12 :-).<br/>
p.p.s. if you have selo&#39;s on and you put your axe into the ranged spot, it<br/>
looks like your playing a nice little tune on the handle of the sucker<br/>

Actuaully I used to agree with this more then I do now.  I realized while<br/>
sure<br/>
we need med armor, and yea we can&#39;t hide or forage for dragon dung.. we are<br/>
at base better combatants&#39; hardier, and have much better looking banded then<br/>
just about anyone else :)<br/>
