<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065470764">Another newbie question here. <br/>
<br/>
My hubby has changed from playing a monk to playing a human shadowknight<br/>
(he secretly plans on revolting from his God - shhh).  Now that he can<br/>
make a pet, I need to worry about what songs are bad to play when his<br/>
pet is around.  Do songs like the Chords of Dissonance affect the pet? <br/>
Will the pet also run fast when I&#39;m playing Selo&#39;s? <br/>
<br/>
Since I last posted, I&#39;ve now acquired the 8th and 9th songs, and should<br/>
be getting the 10th tonight or tomorrow.  I&#39;m finding it hard to save up<br/>
the platinum for a combo sword (I&#39;ve finally put aside smithing for<br/>
awhile, but the tailoring habit is hard to break, with all those spider<br/>
silks I&#39;m looting.).  Sing a song of patience for me.<br/>
