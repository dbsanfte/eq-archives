<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310113114">First Topic:<br/>
I enjoyed this discussion on weapons.  I would like to get a little more<br/>
info:<br/>
<br/>
Where and on what mob do you find Sainy&#39;s Claw?  What kind of group do you<br/>
need to break in and get to that mob?<br/>
Where and on what mob do you find Ebon Razor?  Again, what kind of group do<br/>
you need to break in and get to that mob?<br/>
<br/>
I currently use an Obsidian Shard and Pugius when using weapons.  Or two<br/>
Gnoll Hide whips if extra stunning needed or just leveled to get skill up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
All,<br/>
<br/>
While I have some time before I get to Fear, I still much enjoyed (and<br/>
archived) the information shared for future reference.  But, being a bard, I<br/>
think I want to try Hate first since it does seem to have more bard related<br/>
drops.  In my guild on Nameless, we have 5 bards (most in their 30&#39;s), so we<br/>
would have to share anything gotten, but I can see a desire for going to<br/>
Hate in the future.  From <br/>
listening to my higher level brothers and sisters, it still seems to be a<br/>
&quot;break in&quot; is needed for Fear and Hate on Nameless.  I will go either way -<br/>
new and different is always good in my opinion.  So my question is:<br/>
<br/>
How do you do Hate?  Are their guides out there similar to what you listed<br/>
in the Fear discussion?  Can you again paraphrase, update and shorten in<br/>
this forum how it is done?  I would much appreciate it so that I can again<br/>
archive this for future use.  I really enjoyed the different views and<br/>
techniques discussed on Fear.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
