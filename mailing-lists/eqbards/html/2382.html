<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336050411">i guess i have not really put much thought into why, but i can say that i<br/>
have never used a shield past level 17.  i guess i just assumed the dmg you<br/>
do with duel wield far outweighs the 10to15AC you can get with a shield.<br/>
and its just fun having two weapons =P<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question for higher level bards. Currently Im a 16th <br/>
&gt; level bard and<br/>
&gt; will soon learn the Dual Wield skill upon obtaining 17th <br/>
&gt; level.  Up until<br/>
&gt; last night, I was using a wooden shield.  I had planned on <br/>
&gt; using Dual Wield<br/>
&gt; exclusively once I got the skill.  However, I got very lucky <br/>
&gt; and looted a<br/>
&gt; shiny brass shield (SBS) from the orc trainer.  How I got it <br/>
&gt; was a pretty<br/>
&gt; good story so I would like to pass it on before I go further. <br/>
&gt;  I returned to<br/>
&gt; Crushbone after a long absence to purchase a dragoon dirk.  I had full<br/>
&gt; intentions of returning to Antonica as soon as I got a dirk.  <br/>
&gt; Since I was in<br/>
&gt; CB, I decided to see if I could get a SBS.  When I go to the <br/>
&gt; hill there were<br/>
&gt; only a couple of other people there. I explained to them I <br/>
&gt; only wanted one<br/>
&gt; shot at the trainer and that if I didn&#39;t get the SBS I would <br/>
&gt; be on my way.<br/>
&gt; They agreed to let me go first in the rotation.  The trainer <br/>
&gt; appeared twice<br/>
&gt; but was stolen from me twice by someone who arrived after the initial<br/>
&gt; agreement was made.  The killstealer finally left and the <br/>
&gt; trainer spawned a<br/>
&gt; third time.  I ended up killing him.  To my luck, the very <br/>
&gt; first time I<br/>
&gt; killed the orc trainer I looted the SBS.  Can now gladly say <br/>
&gt; that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I will ever go into CB again.  If I ever decide to use <br/>
&gt; a Screaming<br/>
&gt; Mace, I think I will just purchase it from someone rather <br/>
&gt; than suffer the<br/>
&gt; chaos of CB.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to the original question.  Now that I have the SBS, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; wondering about<br/>
&gt; the tradeoff between using two weapons versus the extra AC and magic<br/>
&gt; protection (+10) that the SBS provides.  Currently I have two <br/>
&gt; magic weapons,<br/>
&gt; the dragoon dirk and Crookstinger.  Both are piercing weapons <br/>
&gt; and very fast.<br/>
&gt; The dirk is DAM 6 and DLY 23.  Crookstinger is DAM 4 and DLY 21.  I<br/>
&gt; personally like the idea of dual wielding these two weapons.  However,<br/>
&gt; knowing that bards are usually #1 on the mobs hate list, it <br/>
&gt; also seems like<br/>
&gt; a good idea to keep my AC up.  I guess the key factor in <br/>
&gt; deciding between<br/>
&gt; the two is that over the course of a battle, does the extra <br/>
&gt; damage inflicted<br/>
&gt; by dual wielding (once that skill is maxed out) offset the <br/>
&gt; extra damage you<br/>
&gt; receive due to having a lower AC?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just based off my observations, every character I have seen <br/>
&gt; who can dual<br/>
&gt; wield seems to do so and foregoes using a shield.  I assume that dual<br/>
&gt; wielding is the way to go but would like to hear what the <br/>
&gt; higher level bards<br/>
&gt; have to say.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
