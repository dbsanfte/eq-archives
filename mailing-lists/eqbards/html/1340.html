<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678209158">There are 2 schools of thought:<br/>
<br/>
Fighter/Bard: distribute points to Strength, Stamina and/or Agility. Most<br/>
people advocate Strength since it helps you hit harder and carry more loot.<br/>
Stamina helps you fight/run longer and influences the number of hit points<br/>
you start and gain per level. And Agility influences your AC and how much<br/>
you gain from each defense skill increase.<br/>
<br/>
Bard/Fighter: distribute points to Charisma, Intelligence and/or Dexterity.<br/>
Charisma is rumored to help you when singing your songs so that they fizzle<br/>
less and are resisted less. It also gets you lower prices when buying and<br/>
higher prices when selling. Intelligence helps you learn skills faster.<br/>
This is the bard of most fantasy settings, Charismatic, Intelligent and<br/>
Dextrous.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I hedged my bets a little. I have a Wood Elf Bard and I put most of<br/>
my points into Charisma bringing it to 100 and the rest into Strength<br/>
bringing it to 80.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little,<br/>

Okay, I&#39;m new to this list....<br/>
<br/>
I want to start a new Bard. It looks like the Wood Elf is the best race for<br/>
a bard. My question is, how should I spend my 25pts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info,<br/>
<br/>
