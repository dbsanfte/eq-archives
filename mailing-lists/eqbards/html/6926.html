&gt; Here&#39;s an example: Using round numbers here, and mythical weapons, both with <br/>
&gt; a .25 efficiency rating, a 5 dam/20 delay and a 10dam/40 delay weapon.  All <br/>
&gt; results assume a 50th level player, with 200 in all his combat skills, and <br/>
&gt; 100 STR. The 5 dam/20 delay  weapon will outperform a 10dam/40 delay weapon <br/>
&gt; by about 27 percent in a two minute time period, in the primary.  If you <br/>
&gt; have double attack, it goes up to 44 percent, thanks to double the amount of <br/>
&gt; DA activation checks. It will outperform by 39 percent if used in the <br/>
&gt; secondary, mainly thanks to twice as many DW activation checks. If your <br/>
&gt; class is capable of &#39;quad&#39; attacks (see above),  it goes up to a staggering <br/>
&gt; 73 percent overall spread between the faster and the slower weapons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There seems to be some misunderstanding about why JM and I<br/>
disagreed on this.  He assumed the same efficiency rating<br/>
(divide damage by delay), I assumed the same damage over time<br/>
(hit for X minutes, add up damage, divide damage by time).<br/>
What he says above is true if the damage/delay ratings for the<br/>
weapons are the same, but the damage-over-time of the weapons<br/>
are different (to favor the faster weapon, whish seems to be<br/>
the case in this game).<br/>
<br/>
If the damage-over-time of the weapons are the same, then it<br/>
is impossible for dual wield or double attack to make a<br/>
difference unless the damage equations are time-dependent<br/>
(i.e. your chance of doing X damage on a hit is different 30<br/>
seconds into the fight than 2 minutes into the fight).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; polarized.  But you can still expect a marked advantage over the faster <br/>
&gt; weapon.  Enough of an advantage to even sacrifice some small amount of <br/>
&gt; efficiency in favor of speed.  A well balanced scimitar, (5 dam/21 delay, <br/>
&gt; ..238 eff rating), outdoes a barbed leather whip,( 7 dam/28 delay, .25 eff <br/>
&gt; rating), by 14 percent in a two minute period used as the primary, and 19 <br/>
&gt; percent as the secondary. At 50th level, in pure melee combat, two minutes <br/>
&gt; is pretty close to how long a typical fight lasts.  Drop the time period <br/>
&gt; down to one minute, the gap narrows, but is still evident.  Drop it down to <br/>
&gt; 30 seconds, it&#39;s a dead heat, still.  Anything less than 30 seconds tends to <br/>
&gt; favor the whip.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This happens due to &quot;strobing,&quot; a bias that occurs in discrete<br/>
sampling.  An extreme example would be a 100 damage 200 delay<br/>
weapon vs. a 10 damage 10 delay weapon.  Even though the 2nd<br/>
weapon is twice as efficient, if the fight lasts 1 second,<br/>
both weapons will get in one swing, and the first weapon will<br/>
do 10x better.  It is not the type of time-dependeny I mention<br/>
above.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   If you factor in the highly variable factors of target defense and AC, <br/>
&gt; first you go nuts, then you come up with results even more in favor of the <br/>
&gt; faster weapon, as you get more chances to hit as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>
likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>
deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>
