pettions stuff, the stats on the items aren&#39;t even<br/>
known yet.  Perhaps some prozac is in order<br/>

&gt; There are two different groups of people that work<br/>
&gt; on Verant, GMs and<br/>
&gt; Developers.  GMs are there to help you with in-game<br/>
&gt; problems.  They cannot<br/>
&gt; modify the database or give you a different item. <br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t even interact<br/>
&gt; with Developers.  GMs cannot fix this type of<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are /feedback and /bug commands to take care<br/>
&gt; of these types of<br/>
&gt; problems.  These commands will be routed to the<br/>
&gt; Developers who can fix the<br/>
&gt; problem.  Or email your complaints to Verant<br/>
&gt; directly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you order pizza delivery, and your pizza is<br/>
&gt; running late, who do you<br/>
&gt; call?  You probably dial 911.  Instead, you should<br/>
&gt; think about who can<br/>
&gt; actually help you with the problem.  Call the pizza<br/>
&gt; company.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why should this matter to us?  Well if IDIOTS fill<br/>
&gt; the petition queue with<br/>
&gt; RETARDED petitions, it takes the GMs longer to<br/>
&gt; handle real petitions.  How<br/>
&gt; would everyone on Innoruuk feel if their petitions<br/>
&gt; took 30 minutes longer to<br/>
&gt; handle because some IDIOTS felt they could get the<br/>
&gt; database changed by<br/>
&gt; filling up the petition queue?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand your frustrations, but don&#39;t frustrate<br/>
&gt; everyone else with your<br/>
&gt; actions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; WTF?????  wis and int?  Man I was ripped off, this<br/>
&gt; sucks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; /petition You all messed up again, you gave me<br/>
&gt; cleric type<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize bards<br/>
&gt; primary stats<br/>
&gt; &gt; are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You probably just typo&#39;d<br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor database again, which is fairly typical<br/>
&gt; these days. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; GM tells you &#39;Hail, guide Soandso here.  I&#39;ve read<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; petition.  And honestly there&#39;s nothing I can do,<br/>
&gt; if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; would file a bug report that would be appreciated&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If Verant does this again, like they did on the<br/>
&gt; PoS, err I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean PoF armor (not to mention the pisspoor color)<br/>
&gt; I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; flood them with feedback/petitions/etc.  In fact<br/>
&gt; everytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; I take a faction hit from someone else&#39;s kill, I<br/>
&gt; petition.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Only the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and typing<br/>
&gt; a message<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a bug report that is never read gets me more<br/>
&gt; frustrated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hate working hard for a crappy reward.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; why I currently<br/>
&gt; &gt; do no quests (for the ones that actually work). <br/>

&gt; &gt; Norrath are making this bard bitter =)<br/>
