in the right context here.<br/>
<br/>
Cleric vs Bard melee should DEFINITELY be a NON-Issue (especially after 17th <br/>
level). Beside the fact that Clerics skill is inherently (sp?) low, <br/>
something like 3 or 4 points per level toward blunt skills, which is <br/>
comparable to a caster, I have personally meleed a cleric in a duel and <br/>
found it laughable.<br/>
<br/>
I walked up to Nektulos zone in E Commons to find a Dark Elf Cleric <br/>
harrassing a friend of mine. He was 20th level as was I, my friend was 16th <br/>
level. He kept challenging her to a duel, but she wouldn&#39;t accept so I <br/>
dueled him for her. He smited me down to 2 bubbles of hp before he was oom, <br/>
after which i proceeded to rape him in melee (he was full health at the time <br/>
he went oom). He zoned out almost dead; I still had 2 bubbles hp. I was not <br/>
twinked either.<br/>
