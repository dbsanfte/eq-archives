 </span></blockquote>Definitely have a couple pumice stones handy.  You not only<br/>
want to get rid of bad effects on you, but you want to debuff<br/>
her at the start.  Her mana is limited, yours is not.  Having<br/>
the stones to cancel any spell effects essentially removes her<br/>
spellcasting ability as a factor, while she cannot do the same<br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
A trick a ranger friend used on me was to quaff a vial of<br/>
vampire blood.  He said it put his magic resist way over 100.  <br/>
I only managed to get charm/fear/chain to stick on him like 3<br/>
times out of 30+ tries.  Another thing to watch out for is for<br/>
her casting camo on herself to rest and med up.  Keep Concord<br/>
handy so you can see invis.  It may seem like a waste of a<br/>
slot at the beginning of the fight, but later near the<br/>
endgame, if she decides to try the camo move, you have got to<br/>
be ready for it or you&#39;ll be facing all those spells again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would start with my MR maxxed out - weaving ele & guardian.  Ranger mana<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do not count on ER+GR keeping snare off you.  I tried that,<br/>
and he still managed to get snare to stick about 30% of the<br/>
time.  The spell is very good at getting through MR.  Use a<br/>
pumice stone (or you can experiment with the &quot;fixed&quot; L22<br/>
song).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is weak and he may panic when you resist and re-cast.  The more you can make<br/>
&gt; him cast the better. Get close to him and stay inside bow range.  Use songs<br/>
&gt; to damage at first because he will be thorned.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another thing about bows (all ranged weapons really) is that<br/>
you need LOS.  If you can put hills, people, etc. between you<br/>
and her when it fires, it will not hit you and she will have<br/>
to wait the firing delay again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You might try to fear chain him if you are not in the arena but just out in<br/>
&gt; a zone.  (hehe if you can pick the spot - charm an HG or Griffon &lt;eg&gt;)  Once<br/>
&gt; you have made him use up his mana, you can play lullaby and continue song<br/>
&gt; damage.  They really hate being winced.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Make sure you keep running around so she&#39;s not facing you if<br/>
you try an AE or ranged damage song.  No point giving her free<br/>
melee damage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Depending on how long the fight goes, his thorns may wear off. I&#39;d try to<br/>
&gt; wait as long as possible to melee him to prevent taking damage from his<br/>
&gt; shield of thorns.  And you can play the same game with Psalm of Warmth. If<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just cancel the thorns with a pumice stone.  The shock of<br/>
seeing all her pre-buffs drop should work in your favor too.  <br/>
Cancel magic will not break mesmerize, so if you can get Pixie<br/>
Strike to stick, you can debuff her while she can&#39;t move (I<br/>
suspect the pumice will cancel Pixie Strike as well, but<br/>
usually it takes off 1-3 buffs, so it&#39;s still in your favor).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you run away to heal or load a different song - remember he has tracking so<br/>
&gt; run to a zone edge where tracking gets all messed up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tracking does not get messed up if the target is within<br/>
proximity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But like Harm said - you might be well served to go down in the 3rd round<br/>
&gt; for future peace and harmony ;p<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OTOH, if you want to establish right now who will be the boss<br/>
in the marriage... :)<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a straight one-on-one fight:  Use the tab key to<br/>
switch between targeting her and yourself (if, say, you need<br/>
to target yourself to cancel snare).  If you use F1 or click<br/>
on yourself, you will lose her as a target, and can waste<br/>
precious time retargeting her.  If you use tab, it remembers<br/>
your target and just toggles between you and her.<br/>
<br/>
One final thing.  Rangers can&#39;t bash or stun.  You only need<br/>
to worry about missed notes.  :)<br/>
