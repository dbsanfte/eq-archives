&gt;on our server, legs<br/>
&gt;seem to drop more than anything else, and boots the very least.  since the<br/>
&gt;bard armor was moved to hate, we only know of one boots ever dropping<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its odd how this works...<br/>
<br/>
Three pairs of Imbrued boots dropped on our server on Saturday alone.  I <br/>
think its the one piece of imbrued that all the 46+ bards on Sol Ro actually <br/>
have in fact.  I have seen many bracers drop in hate and in fear recently, <br/>
and arms and legs are pretty frequent as well.  I&#39;ve only seen or heard of 1 <br/>
pair of gloves and helm (and I was the only bard there when they dropped, <br/>
woo!) in the last month and a half and no breastplates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back next weekend, I sure hope the RNG changes course for me! hehe<br/>
<br/>
P.S. - John, I liked the odds for winning a 1-100 lotto, what are the odds <br/>
of rolling a 200 on a 1-200 lotto?<br/>
