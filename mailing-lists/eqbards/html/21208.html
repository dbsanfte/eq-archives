&gt; A few questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am about to break out of 40 (like 3/4 bub left, it<br/>
&gt; should fall tonight no<br/>
&gt; problem)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Congrats.  Bubble away from 42 myself =)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Which means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo<br/>
&gt; soon.  When i am the haster<br/>
&gt; (IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which<br/>
&gt; i LOVE, the agi buff<br/>
&gt; gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask<br/>
&gt; since its high level<br/>
&gt; song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str<br/>
&gt; boost I think the haste<br/>
&gt; effect is the same)<br/>
&gt; (This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates<br/>
&gt; saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>
&gt; Beserker.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bzzzz, wrong answer.  40 or 41 are both crappy songs. <br/>
40 is single target dispell which doesn&#39;t work and 41<br/>
is a psalm of something I believe (yep, confirmed it<br/>
on the song analysis page).  <br/>
<br/>
As to your question, looks like you will trade the +23<br/>
agility and 20% speed for 6 AC, +15 strength, and 17%<br/>
haste.  I&#39;m going for berserkers the moment I get it. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and<br/>
&gt; shoulders.  What do you all<br/>
&gt; reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists,<br/>
&gt; CHA, and STR (in that<br/>
&gt; order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me<br/>
&gt; looted it not knowing it<br/>
&gt; was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted<br/>
&gt; bronze cloak (UGH!) and a<br/>
&gt; straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have<br/>
&gt; about 2k right now and<br/>
&gt; dont really have trouble making money, though I<br/>
&gt; would rather go get a guild<br/>
&gt; run to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, for shoulders I&#39;m wearing crested spaulders.  11<br/>
AC +5 or 6 stamina.  Not a bad item I think and it&#39;s<br/>
selling for fairly cheap these days.  As to back, I&#39;m<br/>
clueless on what to go for.  I&#39;m wearing a cloak of<br/>
the icebear which has a nice cold protection to it. <br/>
As to belt, I&#39;m camping the thick banded belt.  That<br/>
+15 strength just makes me DROOL.  Course, I&#39;m also<br/>
trying to get into the frenzied groups so I&#39;m either<br/>
going for a FBSS (+20% haste can&#39;t hurt) or the TBB<br/>
(+15 strength /cheer).  <br/>
<br/>
Mind you I try to avoid kunark now.  Max damage from a<br/>
kunark mob at my level seems to be 107.  Max damage<br/>
from an old world mob seems to be 86.  I&#39;ll wait till<br/>
46 to go to Karnor&#39;s to go back to Kunark.<br/>
