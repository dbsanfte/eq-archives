<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054489792">I did it like this:<br/>
1. Jig of Vigor<br/>
2. Screech<br/>
3. Selo&#39;s<br/>
4. HoR<br/>
5. Chain<br/>
6. BBB<br/>
<br/>
	A rule I always went by is, only fear kite on blues.  White and up is a<br/>
pain in the ass and really not worth the pain/death and time involved (imho).<br/>
<br/>
	Find a target then give yourself one pulse of Selo&#39;s.  Next try to chain<br/>
your target.  If it resists then you have enough time to try again while<br/>
running.  If for some reason you fail a second time I would suggest hitting<br/>
Selo&#39;s again and starting over until chains sticks.  Next stay a little a<br/>
head of your target while you fire up Screech.  Just as it is about to &quot;go<br/>
off&quot; take a step towards the target but out of it&#39;s swinging range.  If you<br/>
time it right the mob will run away with out ever getting a hit in on you,<br/>
the bashes are a bitch.  If it resists then stand there and take the<br/>
beating like a man until you fear it.  Then just chain - fear - chain -<br/>
fear.  If it resists a fear then try until you get it.  Fear is more<br/>
important then chains so don&#39;t worry just yet if chains wears off while you<br/>
are trying to get fear to stick.  Fear is what keeps you from getting your<br/>
ass whipped.<br/>
<br/>
	If the target is getting a little to far from the kiting area that you<br/>
like then keep it chained, stop fearing it and let it follow you back to<br/>
the area.  This is also good if there is a wandering mob that it is getting<br/>
too close to as you don&#39;t really want to worry about more problems.<br/>
<br/>
	I keep Jig mem&#39;d because I have low Wood Elf STA and it drains after a<br/>
couple minutes.  I will only twist Jig in to the routine if I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
resist on the last chain and the last fear.  Try not to let your STA bar<br/>
fall below 2 bubbles.  Keep bellow mem&#39;d incase you have to kite, and I<br/>
would suggest switching to a drum if it comes to this.  If you are low on<br/>
health/STA you will need the little extra speed the drum will give you.<br/>
And of course HoR to heal yourself if neeed.<br/>
<br/>
	Good luck.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve only had screech for a little while but have<br/>
&gt;found that two or three resists and I take huge<br/>
&gt;amounts of damage from a very angry mob when fear<br/>
&gt;kiting. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is what I&#39;ve been doing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fear-kite bank<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. Chains<br/>
&gt;2. Screech<br/>
&gt;3. DDD<br/>
&gt;4. Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt;5. Sense heading<br/>
&gt;6. empty<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I chain - fear - DDD rinse and repeat.<br/>
&gt;Weapons are a thulian claw and silvery axe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve actually found it easier to soften mobs up using<br/>
&gt;chains and a few bellows, then wade in with the<br/>
&gt;all-instrument attack. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do these songs get better over time or am I doomed to<br/>
&gt;resist hell?  I know I must be missing something<br/>
&gt;because others have been successful at kiting...what<br/>
&gt;am I doing wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
