&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Uses BRASS, so I never used the song... until a few days ago. GREAT<br/>
&gt; SONG Lowers target AC, and damages  them about one and a half times as much<br/>
&gt; as the level two song does. Use it and get yer brass skill up there....<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll want it for the level 26 song. Area effect<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back when I first tried this song in beta, it used to require brass.  The other<br/>
night, though, I tried it without an instrument, and it worked!  I want to test<br/>
it out to see what the difference is between instrument and no instrument and<br/>
compare it to Chords.  I&#39;ll try to do that tonight.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I noticed, it seems to have a smaller area of effect than Chords<br/>
of Dissonance, which is a GOOD thing.  It reaches far enough to make the things<br/>
swarming you wince, but not far enough to pull the whole zone down atop you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting the song descriptions, it&#39;s a good list.<br/>
