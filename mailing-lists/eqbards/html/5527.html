<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571994133">I&#39;m thinking Lavastorm.  I&#39;ve had some fun ther at 16th, and it requires a<br/>
bit different strategy thn normal.  How many people weave Elemental Rhythyms<br/>
as a full time part of their attack strategy?  In Lavastorm its a<br/>
requirement with al the hot monsters there.  There will be a lot of things<br/>
too tough for you, but it is still a cool place, and the run across<br/>
Nekulutos forest to get there is exciting and cool as well.  Have fun, be<br/>
careful!<br/>

Does anyone got any tips on places for a 17<br/>
level traveller to go? I&#39;ve tried Upper Guk, but<br/>
it&#39;s just a tad bit too dangerous to solo very<br/>
far inside. I&#39;ve also tried Befallen and decided<br/>
that I hate that place and it&#39;s stinky holes in<br/>
the floor and locked doors you can&#39;t escape from.<br/>
(I&#39;ve befallen and I can&#39;t get up!) I&#39;ve done<br/>
Eruds Crossing, been to Kerra Ridge (didnt kill)<br/>
and lots of other places.<br/>
<br/>
Places that I am currently COMPLETELY bored <br/>
hunting in:<br/>
<br/>
North/South Ro<br/>
Oasis<br/>
East/West Commons<br/>
Greater/Lesser Fay<br/>
Steamfront<br/>
<br/>
The Karana&#39;s probably come to mind, but there&#39;s<br/>
lots of nothing there. And lots of things I can&#39;t<br/>
fight at my level anyway. Bandits are Dervs to me.<br/>
<br/>
Loot would be nice, experience would be nice - but<br/>
more than either of those - some place I could <br/>
explore would be great. I recently went through and<br/>
completely (?) explored Blackburrow. Everything was<br/>
green to me (mostly) but it was great fun. I was<br/>
able to carry enough stuff that I was dragging bags<br/>
behind me as I left. Not great stuff mind you, but<br/>
hey - I&#39;m an explorer - a traveller. I don&#39;t like<br/>
to camp for too long.<br/>
<br/>
On Veeshan it&#39;s almost impossible to find a group<br/>
that doesn&#39;t want to just &quot;camp the dervs&quot; or the<br/>
orcs or &lt;insert mob here&gt;. Travellers are far and<br/>
few it seems - so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m<br/>
all ears and songs.<br/>
<br/>
PS: I recently went to King Xorbbs Gorge (Beholder)<br/>
and loved it. It was new, it was the first time I<br/>
saw (killed) muddites and I was fairly safe. I of<br/>
course didn&#39;t explore the whole thing as I didn&#39;t<br/>
have a map - and getting lost in a place called<br/>
&quot;beholder maze&quot; seemed like an easy thing to do. But<br/>
at least it wasn&#39;t Orcs, and it wasn&#39;t Dervs. And<br/>
thank Tunare it wasn&#39;t spiders or scarabs or snakes.<br/>
