<div id="ygrps-yiv-45958">I actually think part of &quot;bard hate&quot; comes from a coding error (theory only). If I am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>
getting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>
bards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>
an additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>
get those faction hits for mobs we never touched). Thoughts?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a new good example of bard hate.  I am standing still with a trade<br/>
&gt; &gt; window open singing no songs on the hill near the derv camp.  A ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; shoots the lead derv with his bow from out in the plains area.  The derv<br/>
&gt; &gt; rushes forward, stops and runs over and backstabs me despite my not even<br/>
&gt; &gt; being in the rangers group, nor in the mobs aggro radius.  If someone can<br/>

&gt; What you think is the mob&#39;s normal aggro radius may not be its<br/>
&gt; aggro radius in all situations.  If you&#39;ve ever tried to sneak<br/>
&gt; up on Chief Goonda in WK, you know that he has a *huge* aggro<br/>
&gt; radius (basically he charged me when he was about 5 pixels<br/>
&gt; large on my screen at 1024x768).  So it may be that while a<br/>
&gt; mob&#39;s initial aggro radius is small, once it has been<br/>
&gt; activated, the AI may be taking into account all potential<br/>
&gt; hostiles it sees within a much larger radius.<br/>
