It&#39;s ok to cut people a little slack.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; For details on the removal of the hybrid exp penalty<br/>
&gt; &gt; (sort of) look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">http://eq.castersrealm.com</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Lest we forget that verant has stated bards are not hybrids.....<br/>
&gt;also look at this I clipped from the post<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a balance issue we decided was also necessary to address. If we are<br/>
&gt;going to make the statement that class experience penalties should not<br/>
&gt;exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with exception to the two<br/>
 </span></blockquote>classes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that we&#39;ve decided to leave as-is).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How much you wanna bet that bards will be one of the &quot;as-is&quot; classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will take any and all action on this bet.  The discussion was in regard to<br/>
CLASS exp<br/>
penalty, not HYBRID exp penalty.  It was STATED that rogues and warriors had<br/>
an<br/>
experience BONUS, and they are leaving these 2 classes as is.<br/>
<br/>
try and take things in context before whining and complaining.<br/>
