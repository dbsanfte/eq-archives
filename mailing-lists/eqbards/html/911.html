<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbard] A Bard&#39;s usefulness after lvl 12 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-821297947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was wondering if anyone has been experiencing the same things that I<br/>
&gt;have been as of late.  To start off I remember when I finally reached<br/>
&gt;level 6 and got hymm of restoration, I was  a hot commodity in just about<br/>
&gt;any group.  However now that I am at lvl 16 no one seem to want a bard in<br/>
&gt;their party.  Perhaps it is because of my hunting in unrest, but I would<br/>
&gt;think a bard would be a useful addition to any party there.  However, it<br/>
&gt;seems a bard&#39;s utility is my undoing.  People either want a tank, or a<br/>
&gt;healer or a burner and I can never be any of them.  Many parties seem to<br/>
&gt;forget the advantages of some of the bard songs.  With anthem, my friend a<br/>
&gt;lvl 14 Druid and I were able to mow down Tormented after tormented with<br/>
&gt;next to no downtime.  In fact my friend rarely cast a spell because the<br/>
&gt;two of us could melee the TDs without too much trouble.  I was armed with<br/>
&gt;a Combine Long Sword and he a runed Totem Staff.  Now I can imagine how<br/>
&gt;effective Warriors would be with Dual wield and dual attacks and all tanks<br/>
&gt;in general.  Does partying get worse from here on out?  I have started a<br/>
&gt;mage and had more luck partying at level 13, than I did with my bard which<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t make too much sense to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aye, you&#39;re finding the earlier version of the problem I&#39;ve had in low 30&#39;s<br/>
lvls.<br/>
<br/>
One solution is to find (or create) a semi-permanent group.  People you are<br/>
with most of the time, who will agree to keep you as a member of the &quot;core&quot;<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the game, there are points where one class&#39;s star dims, and<br/>
another&#39;s rises.  Spell casters are hot for first level or two after new<br/>
spell level.  Bards are hot after certain songs and a few abilities (such as<br/>
tracking at 35).  You just have to keep going until you hit another hot<br/>
level for bards.  Your next one should be at either lvl 18 (discord) or 19<br/>
(sleep).<br/>
