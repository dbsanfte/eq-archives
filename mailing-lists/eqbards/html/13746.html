If you search the www.eqvault.com archive - you could probably find it.<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase as best as I can - Verant feels that the &quot;quality&quot; of the game<br/>
is in part based on the fact that each zone has a unique look-and-feel based<br/>
on the artwork and design.  They are afraid if they did this - things would<br/>
start appearing &quot;generic&quot;, etc.  He pointed out the upcoming zones (I<br/>
believe there are a couple of lower level ones they are working on) and<br/>
&quot;other things&quot; (which would probably be the server split).<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand - perhaps this is a cop-out.  On the other - he does have a<br/>
point.  Perhaps a single duplication wouldn&#39;t be bad; but the zone<br/>
duplication itself could end up being a cop-out.  Instead of really<br/>
addressing the issue - just keep dup&#39;ing the zones - and out of necessity<br/>
you&#39;d always be in the same place - and it all WOULD like the same.<br/>
<br/>
While their track record in bringing up new servers has been dismal; I<br/>
believe the server splits are probably the best solution.  Once a server<br/>
gets to a certain threshold of average prime-time utilization - split it<br/>
into 2.  But you damn well better make sure all members of a guild end up on<br/>
the same server...<br/>
<br/>
If they could do this in a timely fashion - that would really solve the<br/>
problem...<br/>

&gt; This comes from a flippant comment from one of the VErant guys when<br/>
&gt; talking about over crowding. (They said somthing like we could just make<br/>
&gt; a world where all zones are lower guk, oasis,... etc...)<br/>
