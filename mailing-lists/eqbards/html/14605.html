<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby test results <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-817243117">I ran a bunch more tests - the equivalent of Lullabying a<br/>
single Butcherblock snake for 21+ hours.  One thing I noticed<br/>
immediately is that they&#39;ve changed the max number of mobs<br/>
that can simultaneously attack you from 4 to 3.  The 80<br/>
charisma test was the toughest (skunk musk only lasts 5 min),<br/>
but I think the result with the skunk was either a fluke, or<br/>
skunks are more susceptible to mesmerization.  So I&#39;m tossing<br/>
that test out.<br/>
<br/>
Charisma doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference (neither does a<br/>
lute), so the sign error theory doesn&#39;t look good.  But before<br/>
you start complaining that charisma isn&#39;t working, keep in<br/>
mind that this could be due to the large level difference<br/>
meaning the chance to nod is already maxxed (albeit at a buggy<br/>
level).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it&#39;s completely obvious that the chance of a secondary<br/>
resist is nowhere near what GZ said it should be.<br/>

21 outright (3.1%)<br/>
<br/>
With the 8 snake tests, the total isn&#39;t divisible by the<br/>
number of snakes because some would wander out of range due to<br/>
the 3 mob rule, only to return when enough snakes were<br/>
mesmerized that the wanderers could return to attack.<br/>

Total of all tests:<br/>

8100 nods (63.6%)<br/>
4273 partial (33.6%) (34.5% resist rate)<br/>
362 resists (2.8%)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try it with some different snakes next, probably<br/>
in Freeport (once I figure out a way to stay away from the<br/>
guards, since I&#39;m usually afk while letting these tests run).<br/>
<br/>
Trivia:  The logfiles for all the above were about 2 MB.<br/>
