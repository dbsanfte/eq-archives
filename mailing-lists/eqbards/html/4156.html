fun starts to detract from another&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; truthfully, I did not understand the game well.  Now - all I can say is -<br/>
&gt; make it fun for you.  Don&#39;t hate others because you don&#39;t think something is<br/>
&gt; &quot;right&quot; about how they play the game.  It won&#39;t help you have more fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another thing I don&#39;t understand.  The extent to which<br/>
you can give someone grief in this game (aside from kill<br/>
stealing and training, which are bannable) is withholding<br/>
help.  If someone decides not to help you because they think<br/>
you&#39;re twinked, how can you complain?  He was never under any<br/>
obligation to help you in the first place.<br/>

&gt; is the fun in that? Much of the crazy things that happen - happen because<br/>
&gt; there are so few rules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, personally, I think the entire level based system is<br/>
flawed...  :-)<br/>
