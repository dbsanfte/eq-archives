<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090725887">ok, so there&#39;s one other possibility i guess which is &#39;&#39;just don&#39;t like it&#39;&#39;, but that<br/>
has nothing to do with relative power between classes.  this is a perfect example.<br/>
you could have had huge financial rewards (i know, it&#39;s still a small chance due to<br/>
all the things you mentioned) but you didn&#39;t like it and chose to do something different.<br/>
<br/>
this illustrates my view that choices aren&#39;t made only looking at reward given to work output,<br/>
which invalidates your argument that bards must be underpowered because they are<br/>
underrepresented.<br/>

&gt; &gt;i dunno what nietzschian is, but by your definition, that actually seems to<br/>
&gt;describe<br/>
&gt; &gt;the bard class to a T.   you can take the easy way out and play mana song<br/>
&gt;all the<br/>
&gt; &gt;how to pull, or twist multiple songs to make your group much much better.<br/>
&gt; &gt;are you denying that there are people out there who are ignorant or who are<br/>
&gt;lazy?<br/>
&gt; &gt;how about this analogy?  why aren&#39;t you a professional baseball player<br/>
&gt;making millions<br/>
&gt; &gt;of dollars a year?  The reward is there.  Some would say the reward is much<br/>
&gt;more than<br/>
&gt; &gt;of playing baseball at that level?  I think it&#39;s being honest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not really.  Just because not everyone choose to play the class doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;prove that not everyone can play the class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is arrogant to assume that everyone who chooses not to play pro baseball<br/>
&gt;does so because they cannot.  Undoubtedly there are many who could, but<br/>
&gt;instead play pro football, basketball, soccer, etc.  There are far more<br/>
&gt;reasons as well.  It was amusing you chose this analogy to me.  I probably<br/>
&gt;could have played pro baseball, in high school I could already throw an 85<br/>
&gt;mph fastball.  In my senior year I quit playing though because I found<br/>
&gt;baseball boring.  Too much standing around, and not enough brain usage.<br/>
&gt;True I probably could have made millions, if I didn&#39;t blow my arm out<br/>
&gt;trying, if the pressure didn&#39;t overwhelm me, if...  You get the picture.<br/>
&gt;The number of baseball players, or football players, or musicians, or<br/>
&gt;actors, who make millions a year is roughly the same proportion to those who<br/>
&gt;try as the number of lottery winners is to those who play.  Sometimes it is<br/>
&gt;arrogant to assume something, even if it is proven later to be truth.<br/>
