<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177352889">I dumped a LOT of point into piercing when I wanted to raise it from like.. <br/>
0 to what I needed it at 20th lvl. It wasn&#39;t a hassle from then on, I think <br/>
I was at 30 or so after training and in about a level or so I was maxed.<br/>

Hello all!<br/>
	Well i got myself a Dirk , Love the stats , love the effects<br/>
.......now if the damn thing would just work right. My question is , how <br/>
long<br/>
did it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is<br/>
mainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and <br/>
keep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a <br/>
day and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go <br/>
to the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1) <br/>
if<br/>
i throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that<br/>
point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type , <br/>
or<br/>
perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be ) <br/>
does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>
Ok , many thanks .<br/>
