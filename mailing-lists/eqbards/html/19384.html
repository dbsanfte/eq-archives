<div id="ygrps-yiv-357171695">Hey Sis!<br/>
<br/>
Verant has some kinda serious eye disease - it&#39;s having some really bad<br/>
effects on their &quot;Vision(tm)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other day, I sent a couple tells - one to the zone and the other on<br/>
guildsay and *both* of them elicited &quot;You are not serious - are you???&quot;<br/>
responses.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly shouts to the zone, &quot;Did you see the login message??? Littering zones<br/>
with foraged items is now a BANNABLE offense!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly tells the guild, &quot;Did you see Gordon&#39;s latest post??? They have<br/>
discovered that some players are killing NPC&#39;s purely for exp and getting<br/>
levels.  After the next patch, you will no longer get *any* exp from killing<br/>
NPC&#39;s.  All exp will be earned through quests only.  They are gonna leave<br/>
cetain loot items on NPC&#39;s to keep the economy going though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. level 51 is bad, real bad, really really bad.  But now I am done and 52<br/>
seems a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. I have serious doubts about 54.<br/>
