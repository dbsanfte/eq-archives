<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076999282">I think I may be able to answer that.  The entire game, from the Old World<br/>
to Kunark, and even to the upcoming SoV expansion has been thoroughly<br/>
play-tested with the &quot;haste bug&quot; in effect.  For VI to now come back and fix<br/>
it would be a HUGE swing in balance to the Environment.  Maybe not so much<br/>
at the lower levels, but most definitely at the middle to higher ones<br/>
(increaseing as a person rises in levels).  That&#39;s my personal gripe on it.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else think that if the bug had benefited the Environment instead of<br/>
the Players that it would have been called &quot;a feature&quot; and the above excuse<br/>
would have been used to keep it?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>
&gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>
&gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>
&gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>
&gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>
&gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>
&gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>
&gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  Could happen.<br/>
