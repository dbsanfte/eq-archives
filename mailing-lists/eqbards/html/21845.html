&gt; &gt; They do address bard issues when it&#39;s a high priority. Remember when our<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons weren&#39;t proc&#39;ing anymore after one of their patches? They fixed<br/>
&gt; &gt; that within a day I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmm. The only issue I remember with bard weapon procs was when the<br/>
&gt;weapon proc&#39;ing would lock up your songs so you had to camp or zone to<br/>
&gt;clear it. (actually it was discovered rapidly clicking your hotkeys<br/>
&gt;would fix it but very few seemed to know about that trick)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That didn&#39;t get fixed for a couple of months after I first ran across<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only remember the weapon proc problem as I was in Mistmoore at the time <br/>
with a PGT. The bug was that our songs were blocking the weapon proc. They <br/>
had it fixed by the next day. I don&#39;t remember the issue you were talking <br/>
about, but that would seem a very serious problem. Ok, so Verant isn&#39;t very <br/>
consistent, eh? :-)</div>
