From what they tell me, the max-slowdown was placed just below that of the<br/>
best darkness spell, so as only to affect those using the level 54 bard<br/>
spell. If it&#39;s affecting anything else, I&#39;ll sit down with the programmer. <br/>

Here&#39;s the link to Rokenn&#39;s thread.  As you could imagine, there&#39;s quite the<br/>
hornet&#39;s nest on the gameplay forum today.<br/>

Ack, yes, I meant to announce this. <br/>
Basically, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed down<br/>
without being damaged. <br/>
There was a particular exploit where two bards could get together, play this<br/>
song (the level 54 one), and the Fear song, and any NPCs in the effect range<br/>
would stop dead in their tracks and not fight back when being killed. <br/>
I&#39;ll announce it in the addendum that I&#39;ll post shortly. <br/>
