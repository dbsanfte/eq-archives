<br/>
bards are broke as intended.<br/>
<br/>
rangers are getting upgraded, because they are broke.<br/>
<br/>
btw, verant is ceasing class balances as soon as they can (early 2001).  so, if it ain&#39;t fixed soon, well, you&#39;ll be broke as intended.<br/>
<br/>
glad my monk is zipping through the levels.<br/>
