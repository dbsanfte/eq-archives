I don&#39;t dissagree.  Most of the FoH people I have met are very nice, as<br/>
individuals.  And they&#39;re extremely nice to each other.  They work VERY well<br/>
together.  I know several founding members from Beta (Klague comes to mind).<br/>
<br/>
However, as a GUILD, FoH is one of the most arrogant, least willing to work<br/>
with others, most egotistical and loudmouthed guild on the server.  I WAS A<br/>
guide so I know they don&#39;t have GM&#39;s in their pockets.  I also know that<br/>
their attitude and behavior on Veeshan has gotten their GM, all their<br/>
officers and several members suspended periodically.<br/>
<br/>
No, they don&#39;t intentionally train.<br/>
No, they aren&#39;t generally rude or crude to other players.<br/>
<br/>
Yes:  They do own spawns by rotating people in and out.<br/>
Yes:  They do KS if they feel justified<br/>
<br/>
I personally have experienced this from FoH.  I forget their names but way<br/>
back when Drelz still dropped Jboots I was in there, having logged on at 6am<br/>
with 2 friends to get the jboot camp.  The server had JUST come up and we<br/>
got the Jboot Spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as we all know Veeshan has LONG used the list system.  A Group gets the<br/>
room and other groups/people get on a list to get into it when that group is<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Along comes someone from FOH (troll warrior) and DEMANDS To be given the<br/>
spawn.<br/>
<br/>
We, naturally, refused.  And I told him he was welcome to join the group and<br/>
he could loot the boots when it was his turn.  He said &#39;no, I will get first<br/>
loot&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We ignored him and refused to let him in.  Shortly thereafter about 4<br/>
members of FOH, including a 50 wizard showed up.   Needless to say the<br/>
Wizard started KSing us (luckily the ones he KS&#39;d didn&#39;t have boots)<br/>
regularly so we called in a guide.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily we managed to get the boots while he was medding and then we left.<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t the _norm_ for FOH but it happens often enough and to<br/>
enough different people that they get a very bad name.  It doesn&#39;t help that<br/>
if you talk to one of the officers they flat out deny it and don&#39;t even<br/>
appologise for the behavior of their members.   Myrlyn was one of the few<br/>
who would try to smooth things over and from what I understand Furor<br/>
basically kicked him out of the guild.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that FoH has such a bad rap.  But they&#39;ve earned it over the past<br/>
several months.  Calling other guilds &quot;Farmers&quot; and &quot;campers&quot; just because<br/>
they went into Hate 8 hours after FoH left.  I&#39;ve seen them come in and KS<br/>
Nagafen when another guild was still fighting him.  With the excuse that &quot;He<br/>
would have killed you anyway&quot; and absolutely no remorse or apology for<br/>
KS&#39;ing the dragon, taking all the loot and calling the other guild a bunch<br/>
of losers among other things.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Sartori.  I have friends in FoH too.  But I don&#39;t let my friendship<br/>
blind me to the fact that the guild, as a whole, not everyone, but overall,<br/>
is a pack of thugs.<br/>
<br/>
I am not stating this as a flame.  Merely laying out the reasons why FoH has<br/>
earned their reputation.  It&#39;s been a year since release.  They&#39;ve done<br/>
nothing to improve relations with other guilds.  In fact they&#39;ve alienated<br/>
almost every other guild on the server.  And they&#39;ve alienated most of the<br/>
players too.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, I got a lot of friends in FoH<br/>
Do I like them?  Yup<br/>
Do I like the guild?  Hell no, never will<br/>

PS:  In fact I refused to join FoH because of these attitudes that the guild<br/>
(as a whole, not individually) has.<br/>

&gt; They&#39;re the most powerful guild on Veeshan. Because of this, your question<br/>
&gt; will most likely be answered with the typical: They&#39;re powergaming losers,<br/>
&gt; they KS and train people hourly and on purpose, they have GM&#39;s in their<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; pockets, they take over zones and push everyone else out, they perma-camp<br/>
&gt; spawns by rotating people in and out to keep someone on the spot, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; all arrogant egotistical pricks (a couple are, but every guild has those),<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re all kewld00ds that don&#39;t give a shit about role-playing (some are<br/>
&gt; some aren&#39;t, same as any other guild), they farm items to e-bay them<br/>
&gt; (LAFFFF), and they own all dragons/planes. The funny thing is none of that<br/>
&gt; is true, but people tend to belive whatever they read, and the best form<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; publicity in an online game is word of mouth, so...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Usually, the Veeshan forum on eqvault is spammed and trolled with flames<br/>
&gt; stating one or more of the above items, and the person gets shot down,<br/>
&gt; but...they keep it coming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know enough about them (being former-FoH myself) to know that they<br/>
aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; deserving of all of the flames, but it happens anyways.<br/>

&gt; &gt;FoH?  Not familiar with them, but then again the people I associate with<br/>
&gt; &gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt;definitely on the &#39;game&#39; end.  Who or what is FoH?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kit<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That ranger is a character, not a player.  About 5 people played it 24/7<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;get it to 60 that fast.  He&#39;s a member of FoH... need I say more?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s not a game... it&#39;s a business.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At least to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
