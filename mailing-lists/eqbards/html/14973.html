&gt;&gt; Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
&gt;&gt; Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>

&gt;These two I like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An aside - something we&#39;ve discussed before about invis to undead and unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Not playing a bard on Lanys - but a wizard - wizards only get regular invis.<br/>
<br/>
There has been some debate about unrest undead in the past - sometimes the<br/>
bard song works - sometimes it don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Was in unrest last night with a 36th level wizard. Now - you&#39;d think<br/>
regular invis wouldn&#39;t be just a heck of a lot of good in there - but I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten in the habit of casting it so I can med pretty much unmolested by<br/>
yard trash.<br/>
<br/>
Now - here is the interesting part (least to me).  Someone shouts train -<br/>
and it&#39;s a doozy - from deep in the basement.  Out spill numerous assorted<br/>
undead, bats, terrors, hags, etc.  By 36 - a lot of this stuff was green,<br/>
the remaining was blue - and I was still regular invis&#39;d.<br/>
<br/>
I was actually conning them to see if anything there would still give me<br/>
any xp - but what I started noticing - once undead in Unrest get below a<br/>
certain stage of green - regular invis seems to work on them as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if this is &#39;normal&#39; for undead but I don&#39;t remember ever<br/>
seeing it before. I also don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve changed something because<br/>
one hag saw me - one didn&#39;t (and yes, I know hags aren&#39;t undead) - first<br/>
time I&#39;ve ever conned a hag invisible and she conned that she saw me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas?</div>
