<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721140972">My fiends who recently went thru level 30 hell found that doing the quests<br/>
for crafted armor (go talk to the named Centaurs in South Karana) visibly<br/>
moved their xp bub&#39;s and helped get them thru hell a.s.a.p. which was still<br/>
kinda slow but they made it.  And ya, crafted is War only but you can sell<br/>
the stuff to a merch if you cant find a player who will buy and still profit<br/>
- both pp and xp.<br/>

		If it makes you feel any better i&#39;ve died 3 times in lev 30<br/>
and have been in<br/>
		it for over 3 weeks now, going on my 4th week. Its so<br/>
depressing, this whole<br/>
		level i&#39;ve made enough money to buy full steel plate by<br/>
killing giants, even<br/>
		got a box of aku-bar.  While i had almost caught up to most<br/>
of my group when<br/>
		i hit 30, they&#39;ve all jumped ahead and are now all 37-40.<br/>
If im lucky i<br/>
		might level tonight or tomorrow and get out of my first hell<br/>
level.  I even<br/>
		made a few low lev chars to change my train of thoughts to<br/>
get away from the<br/>
		depressing feeling of 30.<br/>
