<b>Subject:</b> Black silk gloves <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813464012">I&#39;ve been hanging out in Mistmoore in order to get a pair of black silk<br/>
gloves.  On Tuesday night, the group I was with camped the GY and secret<br/>
room right next to the GY for about 2 hours.  We killed numerous deathly<br/>
ushers but not once did the black silk gloves get dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Last night tried it again.  While waiting in the GY for everyone to med up,<br/>
a glyphed aegis spawned.  We killed it and it dropped the black silk gloves<br/>
(which I looted).  We then went into the secret room.  Our first kill in<br/>
there was a deathly usher.  It also dropped the gloves.  The second spawn in<br/>
the room was a will sapper.  It also dropped the gloves.  Third spawn in the<br/>
room was another deathly usher.  This one dropped the gloves plus an ivy<br/>
rune that rangers need for their armor quests.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess this is an example of Verant&#39;s screwy random generator at work.  One<br/>
night two hours and no gloves.  Next night four gloves on four straight<br/>
spawns.  Unfortunately, the last three went to waste as there were no other<br/>
bards in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
I was also surprised that mobs other than the deathly usher dropped the<br/>
gloves.  I was initially under the impression that only ushers would do so.<br/>
