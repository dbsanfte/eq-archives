<div id="ygrps-yiv-879756279">Yes you have to be very careful on R.Z. server with AE songs - but they still can be used - just not in dungeons but outside in plains areas ... I have used lute + CoD to solo 2-3 wisps at a time in W.Karana and Q.Hills - lute, CoD, selo, run, drum, heal, lute then repeat process again ... you have to use your F9 view a lot (the long range panoramic view ...) and pan the view for any approaching players or NPCs ... one other thing about AE songs and groups - everyone knows that most songs affect whole group and this includes CoD, or in the case of AE damage it means non-PARTY gets damage - one bug though is with pets - pets don&#39;t seem to get the benefits of bard song and they will suffer damage from bard AE song ...<br/>

Bard is good PvP+ choice as the drum and selo song let you break root spells and just being able to run save you from PC just as well as NPC ... plus being a bard you&#39;re always in a group even if you want to stay solo and it is actually tough to find time to play solo unless you get on odd hour - groups best anidote to weasly PKers as once they get IDed and labelled they have to travel together and they now usually hang out ... near dungeons ... but, going solo in plains is easy for me as long as I bail if fight with that blue creature goes worse than expected and I go under half - selo, run, equip drum, heal, lute, re-equip and then I ready to tangle with damaged mob at close to full health ... of course it helps to the know the zone so you don&#39;t run right into ogre camp blind ...<br/>
