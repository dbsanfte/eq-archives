<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852431882">Now that I think about it....<br/>
<br/>
A level 57/58 wizard told me with all his items he has 3200 mana.  Let&#39;s<br/>
think about the level 49 song and fighting in lower guk.  Say you get 4<br/>
frogs and 2 of the 4 are casters. Your enchanter mezzes 3 of them and the<br/>
rest of the group attacks the melee class frog first.  If the fight lasts 30<br/>
seconds, that means 10 chances to drain say 200 mana.  So, you might get<br/>
2/3rd&#39;s of the next target&#39;s mana - maybe only half since NPC&#39;s seem to have<br/>
so damn much mana.  But after another 30 second fight - not only would you<br/>
continue to deplete the mana of the mezzed one but also the one being<br/>
killed.  So it&#39;s strength would be in multiple mob pulls.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno - it&#39;s hard to imagine that it could be so strong as to make it a<br/>
really useful thing.  My gut feeling is that they don&#39;t really test it<br/>
hands-on.  Ie: do you think that Ester, GZ, and Absor go to Lguk on test,<br/>
shout for a group and try these things?  Or does GZ who knows the exact mana<br/>
pool of mobs, kinda make an educated guess and &quot;balance&quot; the song so that in<br/>
theory &quot;on a good day&quot; - it might get like half the mana from a mob (that<br/>
normally dies before he can burn much mana anyhow - except GZ doesn&#39;t really<br/>
know how fast mobs die.) <br/>
<br/>
It would be funny to depelete all the mobs mana and have your enchanter yell<br/>
at you because he cant cast Theft of Thought on that mezzed Bok Shaman =)<br/>
&quot;Your target has no mana left to effect!&quot;<br/>
