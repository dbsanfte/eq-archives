dunno what changed, but the rapier graphic shows up correctly<br/>
on my character now (the bronze rapier I used to use showed up<br/>
as a dagger).  It is awesome.  With the Whistling Warsong or<br/>
Anthem going, it seems to swing with almost no delay.  I&#39;d<br/>
originally bought it instead of a longsword (sold my old<br/>
combine longsword at-cost to a nice player who hadn&#39;t saved up<br/>
enough to buy it with his charisma) because my piercing skill<br/>
had been lagging behind, but after one night of use the rapier<br/>
is such an awesome weapon that I&#39;d recommend it over a<br/>
longsword. The combine rapier is the same price as a combine<br/>
longsword, and has a slightly better damage rate (5/23 vs.<br/>
6/28).<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I will be visiting Najena again soon, but even<br/>
if we do get multiple barbed whips, I think I will use just<br/>
one and keep the rapier in my other hand.<br/>
<br/>
I would say buy the combine rapier and use it to get a barbed<br/>
whip.  :-)  Lots of stuff in Lavastorm and Najena can&#39;t be<br/>
touched without a magical weapon.<br/>
