<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086682031">The classes are balanced though!!! Every class has it&#39;s purpose and the<br/>
reason necros have good pets is because they suck in groups. It&#39;s true they<br/>
can&#39;t dish damage even at high level there not that great in groups. About<br/>
all they have are their pets and a dd that has a long ass receast time and<br/>
is basically bad not to mention it&#39;s fire based which means most places it<br/>
will get resisted. The dots take over 2 minutes to use so basically I got my<br/>
pet left over and a undead nuke spell. So basically if I&#39;m not hunting<br/>
undead I&#39;m screwed in groups. Especially in Solusk dungeons where my best<br/>
dot and my best dd are automatically resisted. So now I&#39;m left with a pet.<br/>
See why necros pets are so powerful now?<br/>

&gt;I would think that would be common sense.  Why play the<br/>
&gt;&quot;another class&quot; when you can play this class and have a pet<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s better than that &quot;another class&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unless you don&#39;t believe the classes should be balanced (which<br/>
&gt;is a valid viewpoint, but yet another reason I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt;class-based systems).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; verant ever once state that? Again you can do other things to make up for<br/>
&gt;&gt; melee so it&#39;s not unbalancing can my pet mes? charm? mana song ? heal<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;d have a point if the necro class were just the pet.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not - it&#39;s the necro and the pet.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;charm, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t regen mana, but you can.<br/>
&gt;No the pet can&#39;t nuke/DoT/buff, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think, but you can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like I said, if the idea of casting classees having pets that<br/>
&gt;can melee better than or almost as well as melee classes makes<br/>
&gt;sense, then so does the idea of melee classes having pets that<br/>
&gt;can cast spells better than or almost as well as casting<br/>
&gt;classes.  /pet heal me, /pet nuke &lt;target&gt;, /pet evac us, /pet<br/>
&gt;mes &lt;target&gt;, /pet buff &lt;target&gt;, and make them regen mana 5x<br/>
&gt;faster than players (which is approx how fast pets heal).<br/>
