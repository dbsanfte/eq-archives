<div id="ygrps-yiv-478874417">You know I just had a major fight with my guild the other day.  After the &quot;Offical&quot; word on lullaby I announced my intention to retire Adon a character I have to admit I&#39;ve come to love.  I&#39;ve been as many know one of the first bards in production EQ, and this list.  I&#39;ve never been one about leveling or power.. I was widely known for running all over Povar helping folks out and training new bards.. In fact Adon himself only made it to 28 but has close to 100 hours played.  I can say with pride several of my &quot;students&quot; are now in the upper 50&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So when I spoke to my guild about this utter fustration many of them pleaded with me to stay.. Make a new char they said take some time.. you&#39;ll see your still a bard at heart etc.. Except one who decided to tell me that hey it&#39;s just lullaby it&#39;s not all that important.  My reply was &quot;well your a young bard yet&quot;  Well this set off a small little war that I think shows the true split in the ranks as it were.<br/>
<br/>
Those of us who have been around since the beginning or earlier (the few beta bards) tend to view this more the last straw on a very old camel.  And many of the newer ones haven&#39;t got a clue as to all that has come before.. It&#39;s almost like a grandfathers talking to kids about the trip to school.  Only difference is that this whole thing has occured in less then two years.  But now that I&#39;ve had time to think about it I can kind of understand why some don&#39;t see why we are so fustrated.  How many of them remember or even knew about the spell refresh bug that made our songs only function one tic?  I still remember watching one of my friends plumet to his death within two hours of the patch having been applied.  Or the days of ubberbard hate where things would ignore being nuked by a wizard just to slam the bard on the other side of the zone singing heal?  We bards the ones who have always been bards have gone threw alot maybe it&#39;s time we shared ALL of those things Verant has missed with our class not in a flame or a rant but a well posted set of how much their &quot;testing&quot; has missed.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just being hopeful but if they can decide Rangers need upgrades after more then a year of denials.. how can they possibly miss bards?<br/>
<br/>
BTW I too have started an iksar necro.. and other then money for spells it&#39;s insanely easy even a bit fun soloing a yellow is cool.. but my guild is right I am a bard at heart.. and I hate that Verant has made my class into what comes close to a slave population..<br/>

I think the part that really got me that night was my guilds chief bard (I was originally from a different guild that long since died Hey Goat you still around?) was one I had met in his 19-21 range in Caziac while not totally one of my students we wandered together for a bit.  And when I made my intentions clear to the guild he sent me a tell and told me a tale of what restored his faith in barding.. he had seen the equipment I had earned. (I refused twinking so all I had I attained) and how I could twist 3 and 4 songs and how I could tell a tale to the party.. What got me was I was convinced he had forgotten even wandering with me.. and here I&#39;d been one of his inspirations.. damned if that one didn&#39;t sting my heart.  <br/>

sorry for the long note just wanted to share<br/>
