<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337602707">ok i didn&#39;t know that, but i don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case with this guy.  i<br/>
don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever done anything but outside stuff, and i bet he started<br/>
his druid after harmony started working, which has to have been quite a<br/>
while ago if not at the beginning of the game.  i would be surprised if he<br/>
has ever grouped or been inside a dungeon =)  i can&#39;t complain, i got caught<br/>
last night myself, when my guildmate handed me a sky stone after landing him<br/>
in nek, and i had to cancel since i hadn&#39;t bought the sky/hate gates yet (ok<br/>
i have them now!) =p<br/>

&gt; Note: For the longest time, Harmony did absolutely nothing and was<br/>
&gt; worthless at a spell. I bought it because I am a completist and I<br/>
&gt; wanted everything. At some time, they did a &quot;silent de-nerf&quot; and<br/>
&gt; made Harmony more than do something -- but actually be WORTH<br/>
&gt; using. It is possible, if he doesn&#39;t read the net, this druid<br/>
&gt; tried Harmony/heard from like levels that it was worthless and<br/>
&gt; thus never actually bought it... and has not been doing outside<br/>
&gt; stuff with groups since that someone mentioned &quot;Hey, Harmony<br/>
&gt; -works- now&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
