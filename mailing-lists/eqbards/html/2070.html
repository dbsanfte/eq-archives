Thank you very much, that clears up my confusion (and others I have spoke<br/>
with as well, many people have been unloading ALL their lore items and<br/>
keeping just one!).  And you know, after an evening with my rapier and dirk,<br/>
I have to agree with you.  I do look pretty good there, and in retrospect<br/>
probably looked more silly with a sword and rapier--what was I thinking<br/>
heheh?  But I&#39;m still not ever wearing the bronze bird hat!<br/>

&gt;Lore means that only one instance of a unique item may be possessed by a<br/>
&gt;player.  Lore items of one type do not affect  lore items of another type.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, you can have a Dragoon Dirk, a Rubicite Breastplate, a Polished Granite<br/>
&gt;Tomahawk, all tagged LORE, for instance, all at one time.  If you then try<br/>
&gt;to pick up or trade another Dragoon Dirk(or any other lore item that you<br/>
&gt;already have in inventory, including your bank), it simply vanishes, gone<br/>
&gt;forever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This warrants some caution when looting mobs.  LOOK at the item before you<br/>
&gt;pick it up, it  may be a lore item you already posses, or it may be a No<br/>
&gt;Drop item.  Best to leave it on the corpse if in a group, and let the<br/>
&gt;designated recipient pick it up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the rapier/dirk look is cool, IMHO...reminds me of the old Musketeer<br/>

&gt;If you&#39;re REALLY concerned, there are several other dagger classed weapons,<br/>
&gt;some very good, that you can aquire.  Jambiya, Obsidian Shard, etc.<br/>
