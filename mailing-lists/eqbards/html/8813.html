<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-593963683">Just thought you might like to know. My guild &lt;Fervir&gt; had an event vs.<br/>
&lt;Nox Aeris&gt; today on the Innoruk Server.<br/>
<br/>
Basically the two guilds went to war and then we chose a person to race<br/>
from the Arena in Lake Rathe to West Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
I got nominated, 22nd Level Bard(go figure), and Nox Aeris put up a 24th<br/>
level Shaman. (little did i know 24 is the level where you get Spirit of<br/>
Cheetah)<br/>
<br/>
So we take off, and it is a tie at the Rathe Mountain zone. Both our<br/>
guilds have ambushes set up along the way (i planned to twist Rhythyms<br/>
when i got in trouble to up my magic resist). Then the Shaman pulls<br/>
ahead of me for a second... but then he has to stop and cast SoC again<br/>
(i have heard it lasts 30 seconds). I catch up to him, and pass him,<br/>
then he passes me again... then has to stop to cast again... and i pass<br/>
him and never see him again. i got a report at South Ro, that he was<br/>
right behind me (that was where our ambush was set. Both sets of<br/>
ambushers (ours and theirs) said &quot;i saw him for a second, but could not<br/>
target him, much less cast a spell&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
By the time I entered West freeport, the shaman had just zoned into into<br/>
East commons.<br/>
<br/>
So my guild won, thanks to the bard speed. It was quite a shock to the<br/>
other guild since I strutted around like a warrior with my PGT and BLW<br/>
all morning, just for their benefit, only breaking out my drum and song<br/>
when they said &quot;GO&quot;.</div>
