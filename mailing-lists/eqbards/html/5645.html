<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-702840087">I have not been able to really particiapate iin the list for a while as I<br/>
was switching jobs etc. Got to be unemployed for a couple of weeks and as a<br/>
result Tszaaz went from about level 17 to 21 *laughs* Currently I am level<br/>
23. NO MORE POWERLEVELING! I am just going to enjoy it for a while, the next<br/>
two songs (see invis and psalm of warmth) are stinkers anyway,so no big<br/>
hurry.<br/>
<br/>
So! Here are some thoughts from the interum.<br/>
<br/>
Chains ROCKS. If the bard was Brad&#39;s favorite character we would have gotten<br/>
Chains at level 9. Lull, which used to be a nearly useless song to me is now<br/>
a standard part of my arsenal. This may be an illusion but I swear I have<br/>
lulled yellows if not reds (sorry in a swarm /conning is not my first<br/>
thought).<br/>
I am in with a standard group now, and it is a nearly perfect combination:<br/>
<br/>
Cleric- Bards best friend really. He spends a LOT of mana on me, but hey I<br/>
also keep the mobs of his wife the Warrior *laughs*. I make sure to pick him<br/>
up a few of the gems he uses to buff me everytime I go to Highpass, least I<br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior - at 3 levels above me, she often can taunt mobs off me - a warrior<br/>
of my level couldn&#39;t. An actual damage dealer, but it was SWEET to have the<br/>
group decide they /needed/ me in combat *sigh* I am needed for combat, I<br/>
like that...*laughs*<br/>
<br/>
Wizard - KABOOM! And he is a good one too, waits paitently until the warrior<br/>
calls in the air strikes.<br/>
<br/>
This was a preformed group and I was worried that I would not be adding much<br/>
value, but I was wrooooong. They freakin love me for the huge shortening of<br/>
downtime as the warrior gets to heal without burning the clerics mana. The<br/>
wizard loves me because he can now safely med in dagerous places (inviso)<br/>
and he keeps suggesting I maybe kinda powerlevel to 32...*laughs*<br/>
<br/>
btw, when grouped with a warrior and she is only down a bubble at the end of<br/>
fight, arm the lute regardless. On a warrior that is a LOT of hitpoints, if<br/>
you don&#39;t the wizzy will be ready before she is.<br/>
<br/>
On my continuing tour of perfect bardic soloing locations, add the Gorge of<br/>
King Visine for levels 19-22. The minos run FASTER THAN SOW, but slower than<br/>
accelerondo (heeee!). Camp in &quot;the hall&quot; leadingto E Karana and run down the<br/>
chasm on your right, take the  first left, and pull a mino out of &quot;The<br/>
Circle&quot;. Yesssss, you might get two, or three if you aren&#39;t careful. /con<br/>
them all first.<br/>
If you pull a Chasm mino and the Hall is reletivly  empty you better &quot;kite&quot;<br/>
it first. I put it in quotes because technically it isn&#39;t kiting and<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be effected by the new patch. Accelerondo/bellow of course. it is<br/>
dicey, you will often get hit, accelerondo is too fast to do it well,<br/>
regular running too slow.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! Does everyone know about &quot;Heal Kiting&quot;? I use it all the time in the<br/>
Karanas. If you start getting beat on, Accelerondo away, arm the lute. Sing<br/>
Hymn until accelerondo wears out, re-sing accelerondo. Run between two<br/>
points, if you are a risk-taker/vindictive you can sing bellow as you pass<br/>
your pursuer. But then back on task, you got some healing to do. I have used<br/>
this against multiple Reavers and deep blue Aviaks. Warwolves will catch you<br/>
if you try this though, so watch it.<br/>
<br/>
Weapons: Besides the Dragoon Dirk I am now weilding a Polished Granite<br/>
Tomahawk. Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor, probably a loooong forgotten song, will stay<br/>
memed for as long as you own a PGT. What a stamina pig.<br/>
<br/>
Ohh! My Name! As some may know I have been a big fan of Kithicor forest, we<br/>
have had a little study group about it on and off over on CoN/Discussions.<br/>
So when it came time for a last nime I was going to pick &quot;D&#39;Kith&quot;. Then, the<br/>
day I hit 20 I woke up with a horrible realization. She might not think of<br/>
it the first day, but sooooner or later the Warrior in my group was going to<br/>
start calling me &quot;Biggus&quot;. As in &quot;Bigus D&#39;Kith&quot;. (Monty Python reference)<br/>
*sigh* so I went off to the Elven Dictionary and found &quot;E&#39;Taurguin&quot; or  &quot;Of<br/>
theUndead Forest&quot; a much better reference *smiles*. Oh, and the name filter<br/>
does not accept apostrophies, you have to petition and be prepared to wait.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here is my last thought of the day, sorry, it is going to be<br/>
depressing. Guise of the Deceiver is no-drop and Bard/Rgue only. While<br/>
others can still use the Dark Elf Illusion effect, most won&#39;t need it. I<br/>
hear it is a common drop. This means a lot of them probably get destroyed<br/>
*heavy sigh*. AS SOON as I get one, I am finally going to get to RP a<br/>
Teir&#39;Dal Bard. Thought about sneaing in to join an assasin group, but I hear<br/>
the path TO the tower is too perilous to try, even if I would be relativly<br/>
safe once there. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
*waves* nice to be back,<br/>
