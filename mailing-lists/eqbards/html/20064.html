<b>Subject:</b> Plane tactics for bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407182942">All this talk of how to bake a better bard has started me thinking, since I<br/>
hit 46 I have started to receive the odd invite to go on raids.<br/>
<br/>
I have been on a dragon raid (an unsucessful raid because we had too many<br/>
casters and not nearly enough melee types but thats not the point) and I<br/>
understand my role there, however I am reluctant to go to the planes as I<br/>
don&#39;t understand my role there and I dont want to make an fool of myself.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell the bards role seems to be the usual<br/>
buffing/resist/mana song role that I usualy play. I would imagine that at my<br/>
level (46) resists will prevent me from using any offensive songs for the<br/>
most part. Am I correct in thinking this?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any tips on tactics and any special eqipment that I might<br/>
find useful, for instance do I need any extra resist gear?<br/>
<br/>
I would be most grateful if someone with more experience could post a guide<br/>
to the planes from a bards perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Alternativly can any of you point me in the direction of a good guide to the<br/>
planes, preferable one that tells me what to excpect as a bard?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
PS I got my Tamborine a while ago and its great. Inaddition it is one of the<br/>
best quests I have seen anywhere, it made me drag my guild through half of<br/>
Kunark. I would stronly recommend this to any bards with a good level 40 ish<br/>
group.<br/>
