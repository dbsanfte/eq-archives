<div id="ygrps-yiv-39966358">Yea I&#39;m just starting to read some of this thread.  Its pretty crazy.  I am<br/>
not someone who really gets excited about much, but this really irks.<br/>
Enough so to consider action.  The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>
EQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>

:-)</div>
