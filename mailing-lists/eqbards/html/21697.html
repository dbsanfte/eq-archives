<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937043954">He was wondering myself if I would be able to log in in about 15 min when I<br/>
get home.  I hope this doesn&#39;t go away quietly in a few days.  I think what<br/>
VI did was cowardly, despicable, and probably illegal if ever held to the<br/>
legal fire.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was more serious that Vault network is shutting down.  I was<br/>
curious to hear a theory that Sony might buy out the Vault Network&#39;s parent<br/>
company to shut them down since they basically provide free advertising for<br/>
all of EQ&#39;s competitors.  Awfully close to Black Helicopter stuff, but not<br/>
outside the realm of possibility.<br/>

Heh!  Considering how vocal I was on the original thread on the EQ boards<br/>
(Me being vocal about some hot-button topic... imagine that :oP ), I&#39;m<br/>
probably already banned ;o)<br/>

&gt;Some of you may have heard already, but for those who didn&#39;t, a player on <br/>
&gt;Brell Serilis (my current home server) was banned for a roleplay story she <br/>
&gt;wrote and posted to a non-Sony affiliate board.  Please don&#39;t respond with <br/>
&gt;your &quot;they deserved it&quot; or &quot;Verant should be bombed!&quot; flames, I don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt;to start a thread about it.  If you&#39;re interested in the<br/>
&gt;Basically what I wanted to do, as co-moderator of this list, was to warn <br/>
&gt;you that anything you say can (and will, apparently) be held against you by<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Verant.  This list is designed as a private list for subscriptions, etc, <br/>
