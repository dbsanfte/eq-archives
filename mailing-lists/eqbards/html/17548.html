&gt; below 2 bubbles was one wan I pulled that I knew had alacrity, but forgot<br/>
&gt; until just after I pulled it.  That one got me down to a sliver, but I did<br/>
&gt; manage to kill it.  Keep in mind I was only twisting two songs (plus snare<br/>

would be that the most improvement would&#39;ve come from adding<br/>
Chain.  Chain not only snares a mob, it slows down its<br/>
attacks, meaning you take less damage and get bashed less.<br/>
<br/>
I usually also keep Screech memorized.  If you&#39;re losing a<br/>
fight against a mob but can manage to get it under half, then<br/>
you can just chain/fear it the rest of the way even if you<br/>
were losing badly up til then. <br/>
