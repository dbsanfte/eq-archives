would be that the most improvement would&#39;ve come from adding<br/>
Chain.  Chain not only snares a mob, it slows down its<br/>
attacks, meaning you take less damage and get bashed less.<br/>
<br/>
I usually also keep Screech memorized.  If you&#39;re losing a<br/>
fight against a mob but can manage to get it under half, then<br/>
you can just chain/fear it the rest of the way even if you<br/>
were losing badly up til then. <br/>
