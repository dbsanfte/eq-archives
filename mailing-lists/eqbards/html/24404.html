<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100253822">I didn&#39;t kill any frogs, I just used 51 Selo&#39;s to get to him, handed him the<br/>
2 items, let Selo&#39;s repulse to go back to invis, and handed in the items as<br/>
indifferent faction.  Sneak also works to get you to indifferent, and I<br/>
believe the quest was fixed to work at dubious.<br/>
<br/>
And then I never used the key heh.  I shoulda gone to charasis at least once<br/>
before I quit.<br/>

&gt; the cave of the gaz knights and/or krup or whatever guards <br/>
&gt; him.  I read it<br/>
&gt; on allakhazam I believe, that he is their slave, and will not <br/>
&gt; speak or aid<br/>
&gt; others while they exist. Kill them, he will not aggro. Once <br/>
&gt; you have done<br/>
&gt; this, even at dubious, he will give you the HS Key as a <br/>
&gt; reward. To be sure,<br/>
&gt; follow his text, to get him to schpeel about the fang and the <br/>
&gt; spear of the<br/>
&gt; Chancellor. </span></blockquote></div>
