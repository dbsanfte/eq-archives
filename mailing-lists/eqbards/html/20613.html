<div id="ygrps-yiv-49037268">What I understand about Harbinger Dronik is that he&#39;s on the same spawn<br/>
point as the hunters and foragers.  They&#39;re placeholders for eachother<br/>
depending on who you&#39;re hunting.  *smirk*  I believe other named spawns<br/>
are in that same set too.  All hearsay tho as I&#39;ve never done it<br/>
myself, just watched key hunts from over a shoulder.  More word of<br/>
mouth is the Mask of Obtenebration (erudite mask) is from Howling<br/>
Stones off of Venril Sathir&#39;s counterpart there, the one you lose<br/>
faction with.  I&#39;ve seen one in action once and may I say, I think<br/>
erudites (females at least) look damn goofy in full lambent.<br/>
