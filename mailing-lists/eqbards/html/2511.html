 </span></blockquote>What is &quot;proc?&quot;  Where does the word come from?  Words from inside the<br/>
software and its design, like &quot;mob&quot; have a way of slipping into the game.<br/>
Bet you haven&#39;t guessed that bothers me.  :-)}<br/>

At least I have a good reason here.  Programmers jargon is handy for<br/>
programmers but it leads to less understanding for those who are not.<br/>
Verant has a bad habit of using such jargon, even in system warnings, with<br/>
no explanation whatsoever of what it means.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unreasonable and inconsiderate to invent words or give old words new<br/>
meaning then expect others to know what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the software industry for 30 years.  The<br/>
only real way to stem the tide of ugly jargon is to push back and refuse to<br/>
use it yourself, both of which I try to do.<br/>
