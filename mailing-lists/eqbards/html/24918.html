<div id="ygrps-yiv-827388257">The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to do with Selos and<br/>
Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>
<br/>
At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells before they ran out;<br/>
which made the levitate higher - so they could use multiple casts to<br/>
&quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>
recasting.<br/>
<br/>
This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE (and I<br/>
assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>
out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>
used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing ANY<br/>
testing on the bard class.  Literally 19 seconds of testing would have<br/>
caught this bug.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the affect<br/>
of Selo&#39;s.  Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work they way<br/>
they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc).  In this case - 3<br/>
seconds of testing would have caught it.  They admitted it was a bug - but<br/>
refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>
critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>
player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>
bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>
that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level of<br/>
testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>
reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>

Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>
bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the will plummet to<br/>
their death in many areas<br/>
