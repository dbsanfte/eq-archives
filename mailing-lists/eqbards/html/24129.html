<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592875455">I&#39;m sorry - but I have to object to that comment.  Pardon my harshness - but<br/>
I think it&#39;s the single stupidest comment I&#39;ve ever seen on this forum.<br/>
<br/>
The nature of Internet communication is completely language based.  There<br/>
are NO non-verbal clues.  There is no voice cues, no facial expressions, no<br/>
hand cues.  All we have is language.  We have nothing but rhetoric.  One HAS<br/>
nothing but language to use - and using it clearly and concisely is<br/>
essential to getting your ideas across.<br/>
<br/>
You are completely guilty of what I see as the weakness of some of the<br/>
arguments here.  You&#39;ve read the first sentence of my post - objected to<br/>
it - without ever getting to any of the points I make in the post.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I was discussing was that Jeff was making some very interesting<br/>
and good arguments in the context of discussion - but he wasn&#39;t understood<br/>
(by me at least) - because his use of the word &quot;overpowering&quot;.  Until we are<br/>
all on the same page as to what he&#39;s trying to say - what&#39;s the point of<br/>
even arguing?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he WAS arguing that bards are &quot;Overpowered&quot; in the sense of<br/>
what SLYDE thinks the word &quot;Overpowered&quot; means.  I am very eager to see what<br/>
WHEE really does believe...<br/>

I&#39;m going to have to stop reading here. Let&#39;s keep discussion on topic and<br/>
not get boggled down in language please.<br/>
