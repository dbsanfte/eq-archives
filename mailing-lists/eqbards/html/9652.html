<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008697341">To get to the basement - go in front door - go left - go down hall - open<br/>
second door on left - click on bookcase and go down stairs.  Spawn spot. Go<br/>
on past and soon forks and go left then down more stairs. Torture chamber -<br/>
4 spawns in this room and on walls. Go straight and up the stairs (double<br/>
stairway) and don&#39;t turn but walk thru illusionary wall.  More spawn spots.<br/>
See the blood or lava pit?  walk thru it - do not try to avoid it - there<br/>
are pitfalls on either side - walk thru it - oh yeah kill those hags first<br/>
:-) if u need to.  then further in is the ghost room.  off the ghost room is<br/>
the pit.  be interesting to do a loc and see where that puts you.  <br/>
<br/>
Another unrest note.  It is somehow possible to get trapped behind the<br/>
estate wall.  A friend was in a group and one of them got stuck on the other<br/>
side of the wall - petition time and wait for hours for help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>		Haha... I did this for a while in Unrest along the wall<br/>
between the back<br/>
		door and the porch.<br/>
<br/>
		You can see a strange dungeon back there... though if you<br/>
walk up the stairs<br/>
		and look left (where you are looking at the other side of<br/>
the wall you&#39;re<br/>
		peeking through) it is just the normal first floor of the<br/>
house. I have no<br/>
		idea where this part of the dungeon is, though while peeking<br/>
through the<br/>
		wall you can see a bookshelf there... presumably the<br/>
entrance to this place.<br/>
		Though I&#39;ve been through down to the basement down there,<br/>
I&#39;m still not sure<br/>
		where it is... I think maybe it is the hag pit by where the<br/>
tentacle terrors<br/>
		are, by the dwarven ghost.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, be careful while doing this though... the hags WILL<br/>
see you and<br/>
		blast you through the walls. (Often, if you&#39;re camped at the<br/>
back of the<br/>
		house you&#39;ll see their spells burst out of the walls - they<br/>
really are in<br/>
		the basement though, not the first floor where you&#39;d think.)<br/>
