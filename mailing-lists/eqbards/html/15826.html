<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108835770">I am pretty sure GZ stated at one time our Dot songs are all 3 ticks.  One<br/>
odd behaviour I noticed with them is that the debuff effect/Icon will<br/>
sometime disappear before the final pulse of damage is applied.  But this my<br/>
be a client refresh thing.  I found this behaviour while self testing the<br/>
songs on side by side computers (yes I bought a second account just to test<br/>
songs, sad heh).<br/>

&gt; At 48th it gets even better with Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation:<br/>
&gt; Chords of Dissonance: 32 + 1 (Gypsy Lute)<br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord: 33 + 4 (McVaxius&#39; Horn of War) + -AC to mobs<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation: 50 + 2 (Gypsy Lute) + -atk speed to mobs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Effect: 122 dam/target/round<br/>
<br/>
Chords of Cessation with a lute does more damage than I do<br/>
with my weapons.  I tested it against some L8 mobs, took them<br/>
to half, then fought with weapons and added up the damage.  <br/>
The 50 figure above is about right.  To compare, that&#39;s about<br/>
9 damage/sec.  My weapons test against the Allizewsaur yielded<br/>
only about 7-8 damage/sec (admittedly against a L50 mob).<br/>
<br/>
CoC + CoD do so much damage, that using them with a lute does<br/>
more damage than using them with weapons.  It took 10 attack<br/>
rounds (36 seconds) of these two with a lute for me to take a<br/>
wan down to half.  It took 14 attack rounds (45 sec) for me to<br/>
beat it the rest of the way with my weapons and singing these<br/>
two songs.<br/>
<br/>
The 122 dam/target/round Rokenn lists above works out to 1220<br/>
damage/minute.  This is *on par* with two of the top necro<br/>
DoTs stacked.  You can do a helluva lot of damage with these<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
Hymn + Niv&#39;s at 47 heal 29 points/tick.  At 48, it is 33<br/>
points/tick (tick = 6 seconds).  Over a 2 minute solo fight,<br/>
that&#39;s 660 points I&#39;m healing, and thus 660 &quot;extra&quot; hp I get.  <br/>
In comparison, Resolution is only about 200 points, Symbol of<br/>
Piznarn is about 300 points.<br/>
<br/>
Using Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, and CoD with a lute, I&#39;ve been soloing<br/>
greater kobolds and wan knights losing about 0.5-1.5 bubbles.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been soloing Solusek kobolds and zols losing about 2-3<br/>
bubbles.  Yes, that&#39;s right, you can solo once you hit 48<br/>
without having to resort to charming or Pixie Striking.  The<br/>
only fights that gave me problems were a high level SK armed<br/>
with a FS 2h sword, a high level zol also armed with a 2h<br/>
sword (both too high level for me to charm), and a fight with<br/>
a zol where an urd jumped in (had to throw charm into the<br/>
above 4-song medley - finished at a half bubble, thought the<br/>
next hit from the zol was going to kill me and instead it just<br/>
fell over and died).  It is sick just how much more effective<br/>
I am using these songs instead of my weapons.  I don&#39;t care<br/>
about planes weapons anymore - I want a 7-stringed lute.<br/>
<br/>
If the DoTs turn out to be 3 ticks like I think they are, then<br/>
I plan to see if I can arrange a Hymn, Niv&#39;s, CoC, CoD, DDD<br/>
combo.<br/>
