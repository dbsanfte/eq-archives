<div id="ygrps-yiv-521400353">perhaps new ones are no drop and old ones are not.  no idea, but i know for<br/>
a fact a rogue friend traded for one approximately 1 to 2 weeks ago at most.<br/>

&gt;   Never seen one.  I heard in one of the recent patches it was made<br/>
&gt;   nodrop.  I&#39;m fairly certain it is because the head GM was called <br/>
&gt;   down to SolB resolve the issue, and she simply destroyed the helm<br/>
&gt;   after saying she couldnt/wouldnt transfer the item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   All the pictures of the crown I see are a droppable item, but since<br/>
&gt;   I dont have the crown, does anyone know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harm. </span></blockquote></div>
