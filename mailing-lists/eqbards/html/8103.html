learned all there is to know about their own class.  Even at level 50,<br/>
there are still things I occasionally learn about playing the cleric<br/>
class, especially when it comes to unusual groups (like 3 clerics, and<br/>
enchanter, and a magician, trying to kill the ghoul arch magi, for<br/>
example).<br/>
