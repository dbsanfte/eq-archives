 </span></blockquote>If you are level 17, you were using Dissonance, not Discord<br/>
(L18).  Dissonance, I feel, doesn&#39;t do enough damage to be<br/>
used on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Weaving Discord, Dissonance, and Hymn while switching<br/>
instruments *does* work.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s roughly on par with my<br/>
melee ability, which makes it much more effective than melee<br/>
if I&#39;m fighting multiple mobs (especially if there are a lot<br/>
of annoying greens mixed in).  It&#39;s probably not something you<br/>
want to be using in a dungeon though.<br/>
