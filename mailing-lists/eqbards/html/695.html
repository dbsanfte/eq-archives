&gt; what does everyone think is the best places to put the<br/>
&gt; extra attribute points into?  also, what is the best race<br/>
&gt; for a bard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As to the race, pick the race that appeals to you the most based on stats,<br/>
play style and starting location.<br/>
<br/>
As to where to put the bonus stats, many people have different opinions, but<br/>
in my opinion, put it ALL into strength.  Maybe save 5 for something else if<br/>
you like, but strength is VERY VERY important for a bard if you ever intend<br/>
to wear more than leather armour.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a short run down on what the various stats have to offer a bard:<br/>
<br/>
Strength - How hard you hit, though exactly how this is factored in appears<br/>
to be hard to determine.  The big thing is that strength determines how much<br/>
you can carry, and this matters a great deal when you want to wear armour<br/>
later on.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity - A very important stat for a bard. Appears to affect how often<br/>
you miss notes.  Some say that is really determined by...<br/>
<br/>
Charisma - Which affects prices offered you by NPCs and other NPC<br/>
reactions.  Also probably has an undertermined effect on songs, particularly<br/>
mesmerizing and charming songs.<br/>
<br/>
Other attributes you might care about:<br/>
<br/>
Agility - Affects your chance to dodge.  Used to affect your AC, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
appear to now.<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom - Probably the least important for a bard, but it does play into your<br/>
resistances to magic and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Intelligence - Effects how quickly you learn things, which doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
much to a bard unless you want to be a smith on the side, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
