<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351286517"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think here lies the ultimate problem with the bard at high levels.<br/>
&gt; Verant has made things so difficult at high levels that you have to have<br/>
&gt; multiple groups for almost everything, and it&#39;s not very likely that you<br/>
&gt; will be missing the primary class at all. This then makes the bard role<br/>
&gt; extremely limited, taking a lot of the fun out of playing the character.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But the bard role is still important.  Yes, a multi-group party can do<br/>
literally everything without a bard... but I have yet to wander into a<br/>
situation where they would rather do it without instead of with.  We still<br/>
have the ability to make the task or chore easier, even if our role isn&#39;t<br/>
crowd control, melee, damage, etc...  We still augment.</div>
