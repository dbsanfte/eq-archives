&gt; I play Stargazer Erudite Enchanter on Fennin Ro almost exclusively.<br/>
&gt; I have a Barbarian Shaman level 5 also on Fennin Ro but he&#39;s just sitting there waiting for me to get bored playing my enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my frustration with the lack of role-playing on Fennin Ro, I started a bard on the PvP server (my first PvP experience) and ran him up to lvl 4 or 5, but the first couple of times I took him out of the newbie zone I found groups of level 8 dark elves sitting there PKing over and over again without so much as a nod to rp&#39;ing so I gave that up for the time being.  Is anyone playing a PvP bard.  Is this experience typical?<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions on how to stay alive?<br/>

My suggestion: avoid Freeport until you think you can survive it. :)  After getting a little tired of Fennin, I started a bard on Zek last week, and so far I&#39;ve had a great time.  I started in Kelethin, and aside from a few evil gnome and halfling pkers (Hello Yoink, Xoink and Verminnard!), things are pretty peaceful.  And, the few times I&#39;ve been attacked, the stupid<br/>
casters always open up with root, giving me ample time to get selos started and hightail it out of there.<br/>
