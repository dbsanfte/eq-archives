most everyone else..<br/>
<br/>
Bronze Hat<br/>
Snakeskin Mask<br/>
Opoline Earring X2<br/>
Lambent Bracers X2<br/>
Lambent Sleeves (or whatever)<br/>
Cape o&#39; midnight mist<br/>
Crested Spaulders<br/>
Jagged Band<br/>
Plat Amber ring<br/>
Snakeskin Gloves (have the components, no PP for the gems for lambent :-( )<br/>
Charred Guardian Breastplate<br/>
Thick Leather Apron<br/>
Bronze Legs (same problem as gloves, have pieces, no money)<br/>
Bronze boots<br/>
Polar bear cloak (not the cloak of the ice bear, the one you buy from him)<br/>
<br/>
Weapons:<br/>
Dragoon Dirk<br/>
Combine Scimitar<br/>

(what i use where is not important, as long as i keep all 4 melee skills maxed<br/>
out)<br/>
<br/>
Instruments:<br/>
All store bought<br/>
<br/>
Misc:<br/>
Crude Stein (for use after carrillion)<br/>
Squad ring (err...Marshall Ghobber and i are buds)<br/>
<br/>
Money ....  heh...yeah....right.  I&#39;m not broke, because it is possible to make<br/>
a (very tiny) profit baking (when your skill is really high)....but that is the<br/>
only reason.<br/>

=====<br/>
&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
