Ok. ok, I&#39;ll fess up.  I went back to some of my very first characters -<br/>
ones I dropped only after a few weeks or in some cases a few hours of<br/>
playing.  When I looked at their stats, I did a OMG!!!  What was I<br/>
thinking????  Just for example, my hunam cleric has *alot* of charisma and<br/>
some added strength.  Why?  Well, when you are hauling all that loot back to<br/>
the merchants to get those extra good prices from the high charisma....<br/>
seemed like a good idea at the time when all you had to go on was what was<br/>
printed in the *stoopid*  EQ user manual.  Their character creation sections<br/>
(to this day) really do a bad job of helping people get started.<br/>
