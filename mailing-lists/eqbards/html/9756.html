<b>Subject:</b> PGT as a via 1hslash for a lvl 35 Bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882440820">Hi, I was just wondering what people think about using a Polished Granite Tomahawk for a 1hslash weapon at lvl 35? I have a Silvery war axe,Barbed whip and Dirk right now also. The PGT has a lower dmg ratio than any<br/>
of the above mentioned weapons, but I kind of like the dmg barrier it provides for a limited time. My main question is whether or not the dmg barrier and extra strength negate the agility loss when it procs? My agil is base at 110 base and I have not bought mush agil increasing items. Thanks for any suggestions, I&#39;d like to hear what people think on the PGT.</div>
