<div id="ygrps-yiv-874995277">At lvl 15 I looked up a group in the Derv Camp in West Commons. The spawn <br/>
rate is very fast in this camp (same in all derv camps?) that the heal song <br/>
will make them love you. Groups used to fight over me when I got there and <br/>
they wept when I left lol. You may need an almost full group to hold the <br/>
camp safely. The only problem is what do do with all the Derv Rings you get, <br/>
had 32 rings at one point so I started to give them away to newbies hehe. <br/>
Also lots of Wisps around for that extra cash :) To me this camp was both <br/>
good exp and loot.<br/>

&gt;Hi.  I stumbled upon this list and I&#39;m so glad I found it. I wish I had <br/>
&gt;known about it sooner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am Telania, prior 15th lvl bard lady.::pouts::  I died shortly after <br/>
&gt;hitting my new mark in HighPass.. (them dumb Orcs).  I was thinking of <br/>
&gt;heading to Unrest with my RL hubby who is a 14th lvl WE Warrior.  But after <br/>
&gt;reading about Unrest I dont&#39; think we&#39;re ready.  Sounds like we need to <br/>
&gt;mature just a tad bit more.. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ANYWAY, now that i&#39;ve side tracked.. where is a good spot for my lvl to be? <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve taken other suggestions like one,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;go to kerra isle! Good loot and easy&quot;. uh, They like forgot to mention <br/>
&gt;Trains.  Died quiet harshly I might add. eh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I will ask my brethen.. HELP?! hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any and all would be appriecated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thank you<br/>
