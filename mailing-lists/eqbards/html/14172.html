<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162024436">I believe that the DE illusion gives you the base faction for Dark Elves but<br/>
this faction is then modified by your choice of deity and any other faction<br/>
adjustments you may have accrued (or not accrued as the case may be) as your<br/>
normal self.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard that some people can enter the Ogre city with it unless they<br/>
have been killing bouncers, but most people cannot enter Neriak because the<br/>
adjusted base faction is just not good enough for them to like you. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone raised their faction enough to actually enter Neriak unmolested?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have noticed that the Dark Elf illusion does not have any effect on<br/>
&gt; faction, is this correct? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I though the whole reason for it was so that people would <br/>
&gt; think you&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; dark elf, and treat you accordingly. But, I seem to still be KOS in<br/>
&gt; Nektulos, etc. and he dark elf merchies in South Ro still <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t sell to me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it seems to me that the illusion is pretty much just a <br/>
&gt; toy, with no real<br/>
&gt; value. Good thing it has good stat boosts otherwise. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Am I missing something?<br/>
