<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342680365">Reason i was asking is because i&#39;m obsessed with doing the ivandyr&#39;s hoop<br/>
quest (its usually a good investment). In the past i&#39;ve gotten 2 others, one<br/>
of which i sold for 4k + a kylong wrist guard and the other i got a plat<br/>
diamond ring for.  This time I had 40 rubies, got a hoop on the 8th&#39;s ruby.<br/>
Traded the hoop to a friend for the girdle....  Now i still had Lynuga up so<br/>
i figured i&#39;d keep her and get another hoop.  Do NOT try to get 2 out of her<br/>
in 1 spawn.  I wasted my 32 other rubies on her and didnt get any.  So the<br/>
moral of the story... I guess i paid 5300pp for the belt.  But the original<br/>
plan was to get another hoop and sell it to replenish the cost of all those<br/>
rubies.  Now i dont have enough cash to buy 20 more rubies to get another<br/>
hoop *pout*.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised how I&#39;ve upgraded my equipment by doing that silly<br/>
expensive yet very rewarding quest.<br/>
<br/>
Guess its time to empty my good ol necro&#39;s bank account and get some more<br/>
rubies hehe.  I think i&#39;ll be keeping the belt after reading up on it.  I<br/>
dont have a haste belt, I was still using a troll hide belt (which i got on<br/>
the first spawn HAHA!)<br/>
