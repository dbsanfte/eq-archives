<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003250756">LOL.  Don&#39;t worry Harm some of can sympathize with your frustration easily.<br/>
Believe me I work in the software development profession, have for 10+ years<br/>
for 3 different companies.  If at any of them we behaved as Verant does we&#39;d<br/>
have lost our jobs, period.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure its laziness though.  Its more like arrogance from what I see.<br/>
We should all just fell damn lucky to be allowed to play &#39;their&#39; game.<br/>
(whew, almost used caps but restrained myself).  Their general opinion seems<br/>
to be if &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t like it to bad.  If &#39;we&#39; don&#39;t like it we will fix it.<br/>
Despite Gordon&#39;s claims to the contrary this is still their opinion, he&#39;s<br/>
just better at hiding it.  Semantically, he&#39;s a better liar than Brad and<br/>
Smed.  GZ I think is just too focused on what he likes to really notice the<br/>
other stuff.  Hence Necros get more abilities, new spells, new spells for<br/>
their pets.  I though not adding much to a group was a, to quote Abashi,<br/>
&quot;price that had to be paid for being so good in another area&quot;, ie. soloing.<br/>
Apparently that does not apply to casters.<br/>
<br/>
I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>
game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>
hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much harder,<br/>
and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>
playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>
classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>

  Ah well, I&#39;m allowed to be a little unconventional at times.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s hard to hate something you love so much, but I&#39;ve got to be <br/>
  honest and blunt in times like this.  I want to believe!<br/>
