<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052081624">OK, call me stupid but I&#39;m still not sure how to interpret this.  The way I<br/>
read it, your Charisma stat has no impact whatsoever on your chances to<br/>
resist a spell directed at you.  Makes sense to me.  The second sentence<br/>
&quot;..interact/affect creatures&quot; seems to indicate that a higher charisma means<br/>
you have a better chance of affecting mobs with your songs, i.e. less chance<br/>
for them to resist.  This reopens the issue I raised last week.  Example:<br/>
Two 20th level bards attempt to use Lullaby song against a 23d level mob.<br/>
One bard has a charisma of 85.  The other bard has charisma of 100.  Singing<br/>
and instrument skills both the same.  Based on how I interpret Butler&#39;s<br/>
comment, the bard with the 100 charisma has a better chance of putting the<br/>
mob to sleep.  If charisma has no effect on mob resistance, then both bards<br/>
would have an equal chance of putting the mob to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to know the correct answer to this issue.  I wear items<br/>
that increase my charisma for the sole purpose of increasing my chances of<br/>
affecting mobs with my songs.  I have other items I can wear that increase<br/>
other stats as well as improve my AC.  If charisma doesn&#39;t affect mobs<br/>
resistance, there is no reason, for me to wear the charisma increasing items<br/>
unless I am selling stuff to merchants.  I guess wearing the charisma items<br/>
to reduce my chance of missing notes is a reason to wear them but I could<br/>
live with missing the notes in exchange for the benefit the other items<br/>
give.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;     Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>
&gt;     one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>
&gt;     interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>
&gt;     Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess this explains where the talk about charisma affecting<br/>
&gt; missed notes started.  And the talk about charisma not<br/>
&gt; affecting resists is a misinterpretation (your charisma does<br/>
&gt; not affect *your* resist rate).  The entire post is included<br/>
&gt; below if you&#39;re interested in the other stuff:<br/>
