After reviewing this thread as well as some others on the other boards, and <br/>
chatting with some of our inhouse people that play bards (we have several of <br/>
those), we&#39;ve decided to decrease the taunt factor of the bard songs. This <br/>
is not going to lead to a drastic change to how the bard class is played, as <br/>
bards need to know when to stop singing, but it should definatly be <br/>
noticible.<br/>
The problem centers around how a creatures hate-list works. Without going <br/>
into detail, creatures also hate people who cast beneficial spells on people <br/>
they hate. Since bards do this roughly every 6-12 seconds, it can get a bit <br/>
dangerous<br/>

A nice change from &quot;deal with it.&quot;<br/>
