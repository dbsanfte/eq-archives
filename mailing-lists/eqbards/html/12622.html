  It&#39;s true that no one on Innoruuk has done as well of a job as LoD<br/>
  on dragon raids.  But you need to keep in mind, you are but a small<br/>
  piece of the puzzle in the big picture.  While most people only <br/>
  know people on their server, I have the privledge of speaking with<br/>
  many people (including their tactics) on several other servers.<br/>
  I build my tactics from other proven tactics.  And sure... bards<br/>
  want to sound useful, so we say we can bring your resistances up<br/>
  through the roof.  But I&#39;ve noticed that high resists don&#39;t always<br/>
  cut damage factors.  I&#39;ve noticed that since day one.  With eq and<br/>
  spell buffs, you can bring your cold resist to the 120&#39;s - 150&#39;s<br/>
  for Vox.  Someone said that 125 doesn&#39;t have any impact, but 225<br/>
  does.  heh.  It&#39;s my opinion, as I have seen with every single other<br/>
  mob in this game that regardless of resistance, you are gonna be<br/>
  lucky and unlucky at times on damage.  Hell, ice goblin wizards<br/>
  can still cast their stupid shock spells on me for almost<br/>
  full dmg, despite the fact I play mystic shielding.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not downplaying resistances, but there is some luck factor<br/>
  involved which skews everything at times.<br/>
<br/>
  LoD had one bard (blue to me, poorly equiped) Sagnaria (sp) and<br/>
  Weadeneye... that was it.  And your crew had their plane gear on<br/>
  from what I saw, no special cold resist stuff, yet you still <br/>
  clobbered Vox swiftly.  Level/experience is clearly better than<br/>
  resistances.  Hell, you all were doing dragons without bards at<br/>
  one point.  And you still won easily.  (Gotta be the rogues ;p)<br/>
