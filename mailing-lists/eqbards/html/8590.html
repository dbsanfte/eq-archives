<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093347137">Ok, your further problem is use DDD instead of screech to get your skill<br/>
up. With the brass horn - not the mino horn. Like any of them - if your<br/>
skill is low - it will take a bit - picks up, then slows down a bit once<br/>
you get near topping off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still scratching my head on how anyone could have gotten to lvl 26<br/>
without using DDD and a horn as that is MY current weapon of choice. Given<br/>
an area where I know there is nothing dangerous to hit - I do MUCH more<br/>
damage with this - than any weapon I am ever likely to weild.<br/>
<br/>
The damage difference with and without a horn is like night and day.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>
