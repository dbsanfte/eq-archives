 </span></blockquote>I am also a resident of Solusek Ro.  Indeed, Cazic is &quot;The Place&quot; for <br/>
experience and cash from about level 30-39.  However, this means that it <br/>
has become insanely crowded as the hump in the population curve hit those <br/>
levels.  The courtyard usually has at least 3 groups camping; the throne <br/>
room generally 2-3 groups (since pickings get thin with more than 2, one <br/>
group will usually get fed up and leave after a while when there are more <br/>
than that).  The gator tank closest to the zone usually has a group camped <br/>
at it.  The cave down underneath that tank sometimes does (it&#39;s a less <br/>
popular spot because it&#39;s difficult to zone from).  The room next to the <br/>
Avatar&#39;s spawn point is often-but-not-always camped, but I expect it to <br/>
move to the almost always camped stage within another week or so. <br/>
 (Currently it&#39;s still in the upper edge of the population curve.)  Word of <br/>
the hidden temple in the maze has been spreading, so it&#39;s starting to <br/>
become another popular camping site (though not as popular as the others <br/>
simply because it&#39;s not as easily reached and doesn&#39;t have the convenient <br/>
zone access...however, it has the advantage of freedom from other groups <br/>
trains).<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it is, the special items from Cazic are becoming a <br/>
lot more difficult to pick up for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The highest level dungeons (Nagafen&#39;s Lair, Lower Guk, and deep Mistmoore) <br/>
are just beginning to feel the population surge.  (I don&#39;t know about the <br/>
ice giant parts of Permafrost -- I haven&#39;t been up there since outgrowing <br/>
the goblins.)  I fear that these zones will become nearly unplayable long <br/>
before the promised Christmas release of the expansion pack, as more and <br/>
more players reach these levels and pile up with nowhere else to go. <br/>
 Already the easily accessible entrances to all of these are fairly <br/>
steadily camped.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the other planes will be fixed and open sometime soon, providing <br/>
more choices.  And perhaps one of the new areas being added to the western <br/>
(Erudite) continent will have stuff appropriate for the top levels.<br/>
