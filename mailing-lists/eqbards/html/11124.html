<div id="ygrps-yiv-308009267">Hi all, I&#39;m making a bard as a secondary character to my cleric.  Just<br/>
a<br/>
few basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th time on the<br/>
list.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the online guides<br/>
I found were useless)<br/>
<br/>
Stats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better to dex<br/>
than...<br/>
In other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I was<br/>
thinking of making a half elf, since I want the better vision, and I&#39;ve<br/>
played a wood elf before...<br/>
<br/>
What skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?  Hand to<br/>
hand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all those times<br/>
I attack with an instrument...<br/>
<br/>
Any other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking myself with my<br/>
cleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan) to prevent<br/>
my<br/>
first character from twinking him) (not a judgment on twinkers, I just<br/>
think it detracts from the fun, to each their own)</div>
