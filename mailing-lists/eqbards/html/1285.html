&gt;Ok, I have a question for you all.  I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>
&gt;server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but I<br/>
&gt;seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>
&gt;you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>
&gt;players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>
&gt;real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>
&gt;anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>

You have to recognize that spells are not intelligent and cannot<br/>
distinguish between people you &quot;kinda like&quot; and people you are neutral<br/>
towards.  Sad to say, this means that area-effect spells can be dangerous.<br/>
The only suggestion would be to a) never use them or b) warn people not to<br/>
get near you.  Heck - that might even make camping easier for you, if all<br/>
the players who come near your group keep falling asleep *chuckles*<br/>
