<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874096789">Hello there guys =)<br/>
<br/>
I have been soloing NPCs from Kerra Island (the Catman people) for a while.<br/>
They are really, really good exp at 18th lvl, not hard to solo, non<br/>
carters, some of them spanw alone, fast spanw rate (no more than 5minutes)<br/>
and a decent loot (around 4gp plus a skin worth 2gp). Then while I heal up,<br/>
I kill willowisps to get a couple GLS.<br/>
The only point that has been tricking me is about the faction hit...<br/>
I have been getting a bad faction hit with &quot;Prexuz&quot;. That made me wonder...<br/>
Who is Prexuz? (note that Prexus, the Ocean Lord, is spelled with &quot;s&quot;,<br/>
while the faction hits PrexuZ).<br/>
If anyone knows anything about this plz let me know<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ericka, the sexyest bardess on Prexus.</div>
