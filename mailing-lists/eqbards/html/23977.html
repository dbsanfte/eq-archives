<div id="ygrps-yiv-668412970">I wonder how many bards, or for that matter, how many of each class go anon<br/>
or roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
I would say a bard count is infinitely more accurate than say a wizard or<br/>
druid count.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve been directly asked to help locate a corpse maybe three times,<br/>
and I&#39;m never roleplay or anon.  It used to be a pain when /consent = loot,<br/>
cause you had no option but to drag the person along with you, which<br/>
invariably led to him cancelling autofollow when hit by a mob you usually<br/>
outrun, cancelling autofollow when he fell too far behind, etc ad nauseum.<br/>
Now that /consent = drag, it takes about 25% of the time and effort it used<br/>
to.  Pulse locate, selos, autorun.  If I have to maneuver, pulse, selos,<br/>
autorun...then drag back.  Now the worst part is how fast you gotta hit drag<br/>
when running...it takes no time at all to get out of drag range.  Feel like<br/>
I&quot;m playing the old arcade &quot;Track and Field&quot;.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Course, with my lvl 20 halfling druid, I appear at a circle, and more often<br/>
than not, I get 2 or so tells asking if I can port, whether I&#39;m anon or not<br/>
(usually am).<br/>
<br/>
OMG...I rambled again...I&#39;ll shutup for a couple mins.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw, it took me way too long to get 1 bubble into 30 yesterday.  I was<br/>
in a full group in OT, beating up stuff yellow/red to me, constant pulls.  I<br/>
always thought hell levels were made out to be worse than they are...now I<br/>
see they&#39;re worse than I thought...hehe.  Oh well...<br/>
