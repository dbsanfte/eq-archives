<div id="ygrps-yiv-598463683">Tee hee..:)<br/>
<br/>
The dirk I got was a real stroke of luck...<br/>
well...kinda.<br/>
<br/>
II noticed that on Fennin Ro at least, the freeport guards<br/>
in certain are constantly being killed by some one.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I had saved up about 27pp before this just from being<br/>
a pack rat and being, I admit, twinked in the armor dept<br/>
by a good friend.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the thing is these guys were killing the FP guards and<br/>
not looting the corpses for some reason.  Kindly they let me loot them<br/>
so I did.  Each guard would drop a fine steel longsword, a damaged<br/>
helm, and a kite shield.  The FS weap would sell for 4.5pp and the<br/>
militia shield would sell for 8pp.<br/>
<br/>
So I hung out with them for a while and made a small fortune ( 100pp).<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I havent yet seen another group that would let me have the loot,<br/>
but if you can find one...its nice..:)<br/>
<br/>
The dirk cost me 70pp too.  I tried to find lower but every time I tried to<br/>
get a<br/>
lower price people would laugh at me.<br/>
<br/>
So considering that I was lucky to have enought to get it at all...I decided<br/>
that<br/>
I would go ahead and plunk down 70pp.  and boy is it worth it.<br/>
I love the dirk, and I love the way it looks...small, quick, deadly..*BG*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, tonight I think Ill start on those pesky Lambent quests..:)<br/>

&gt; decent weapon, since you&#39;ve got a dirk and are a level up on him.  &lt;glares<br/>
&gt; at Cerulia for owning a dirk&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How about some group tactics for bards lessons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bah!  By the time you get this you&#39;ll be level 11 and I&#39;ll go back to<br/>
