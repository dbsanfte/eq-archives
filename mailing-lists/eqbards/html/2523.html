&gt;I haven&#39;t been able to come up with a word that means the same thing - I<br/>

&gt;proc vs. &quot;magic weapon that casts a spell, too&quot; is a bit prohibitive....<br/>

Find a term for this effect that&#39;s simple, elegant, poetic, accurate and<br/>
intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
To me using &quot;proc&quot; is similar to using &quot;snork&quot;.  Both are equally<br/>
meaningless to the uninitiated.<br/>
<br/>
To start the ball rolling, the most obvious term is &quot;spell-casting weapon.&quot;<br/>
 But that&#39;s rather long and not very poetic.  Someone out there will hit<br/>
the right word.  I&#39;m sure of it.  We can strike a blow for poetry.  Imagine<br/>
a bit of terminology fostered by the bards for its beauty and utility...<br/>
