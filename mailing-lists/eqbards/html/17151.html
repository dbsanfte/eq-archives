<div id="ygrps-yiv-623590460"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;No the few times I got hit were when early in the fight they both missed<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly my point.  Although they normally outperform you, the random<br/>
number generator gave them a few really bad rolls.  That&#39;s the only way<br/>
you&#39;d ever be able to outdamage someone who generally outdamages you.<br/>
That&#39;s where the &quot;20% over 50 fights&quot; (the exact numbers are hypothetical,<br/>
of course) comes from.  As the duration of the test sample (ie, the more<br/>
rounds of combat), the damage dealt falls more inline with what was<br/>
expected.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re correct on the level difference contributing to the skew.  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed melee damage depends on the level difference between myself and the<br/>
mob.  For the test to be most accurate, you&#39;ll need a partner that&#39;s the<br/>
same level, with the same weapon and weapon skill.  Since the SK would use a<br/>
2H, that one&#39;s gonna be harder to test... John?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d LOVE to see the logs if you perform this test.  It&#39;s something<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to do with a warrior friend, once he hits 50 (almost<br/>
there).<br/>
