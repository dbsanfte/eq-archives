<b>Subject:</b> Play the damn mana song (was: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to change how ...) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563447331">Ugggg.  Last night was the first time someone actually said to me, &quot;just<br/>
play mana song&quot;.  I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted but I did.  I<br/>
told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>
mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>
I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>
it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; enchanter if you<br/>
want constant mana regen.<br/>
