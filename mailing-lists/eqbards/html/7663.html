implemented before the songs would be available?<br/>

If you haven&#39;t yet, I urge you to make the trip on the test server to the<br/>
new temple.  It is quite a pretty place, and you will get a taste of what<br/>
is to come questwise.  I was having a blast running around the place<br/>
Hailing every named NPC there, along with the other eleven level 1 dark<br/>
elves. ;)<br/>
<br/>
The temple can be found on the test server, off Lavastorm, across from the<br/>
Solusek entrances.  Specifically, the location of it is 1300, 280.  I<br/>
found cleric quests that required turning in enchanted platinum for the<br/>
dwarf to smith the reward, various caster quests.  No bard quests could I<br/>
find, but who&#39;s to say what further updates will take place<br/>
