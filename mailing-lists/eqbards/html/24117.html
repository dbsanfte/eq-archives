<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049305985">I never bothered with these.  The descriptions kind of confused me, I<br/>
hate the 12-hour timer, and I&#39;ve been stuck dragon hunting or gathering<br/>
exp in Sebilis for a level or so, hardly the places to test things.  But<br/>
I was looking for the Ancient Jarsath in FV the other night (any hints?<br/>
does he have a PH?) and figured I&#39;d try them out.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Highsun - described as &quot;Stun, Cancel Magic, Shadowstep&quot; on<br/>
eqsongs.  Shadowstep is described on eqcasters as &quot;short distance self<br/>
only gate travel (900 feet)&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what 900 feet equals.  What<br/>
this song does (I really should have tested it by targetting myself,<br/>
I&#39;ll try that next) is Shadowstep the TARGET.  So it gates the MOB.  The<br/>
message is:  &quot;&lt;mob&gt; gates.&quot;  2 of 7 times I used this, the MOB<br/>
returned.  The other 5 times it did not.  This was in FV, so those MOBs<br/>
might have run into some enemies.  I need to test it further to see just<br/>
HOW far it throws them.  It was out of visual range (on a pretty flat<br/>
surface) in any case.  Has some interesting implications, and sounds<br/>
REALLY dangerous.  You can probably kill people using this on a blue<br/>
server by singing it on the MOB they&#39;re fighting and hoping it trains<br/>
them.  (I&#39;m surprised Verant didn&#39;t think of that to begin with.)  I did<br/>
find it pretty useful soloing; you can use it to summarily dismiss the<br/>
add-on junk.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Midnight is described as &quot;target:  fear/SoW&quot;.  In fact, it&#39;s AE<br/>
fear/SoW, as I discovered when I sang it near some guards.  :(  This is<br/>
in some ways more useful than normal fear, since the SoW lets the MOBs<br/>
run a lot further before the song expires, and they have to return at<br/>
normal speed.  It buys you more time, in other words.  And I suppose it<br/>
is possible for them to get out of range this way (although they do not<br/>
appear to do so if you stand still).  The drawback is that, since they<br/>
go farther, they can train more stuff back to you.  I&#39;d probably use<br/>
this instead of the other fear song if it weren&#39;t for the 12-hour timer.<br/>
<br/>
Any other observations?<br/>
