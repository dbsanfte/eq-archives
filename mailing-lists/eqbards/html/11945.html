 </span></blockquote>Well thats my point, once cazic learns you are in the pof, he starts willy<br/>
nilly zapping people. The trick is to not let him know you are the in the<br/>
zone, and that means being very carefull about not creating situations<br/>
where autopull happens and letting mobs get away that know you are in the zone.</div>
