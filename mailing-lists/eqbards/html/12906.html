<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964692607">The bar din my regular group (where i&#39;m the cleric and leader) asked<br/>
what good she was recently.  I sometimes think we can lose sight of what<br/>
we&#39;re doing (man I HATE those nights when she can&#39;t play).  I think our<br/>
#1 job is to make everyone else better at what they do best (which is<br/>
how verant designed us).  We take the down time healing requirment off<br/>
the clerics (I cannot tell you how much, even at my low lvl this means,<br/>
I have mana to buff everyone, and even throw some stuns in combat when<br/>
our bard is around).  We help the real melees fight better (granted many<br/>
other people do this better than us, but at a great cost in mana).  We<br/>
help the casters regain mana (at levels higher than me).  <br/>
Secondly we fill in when you don&#39;t have the ideal group configuration. <br/>
No enchanter, then crowd control falls on our lap.  No tank (well at<br/>
lower levels, it seems we cant do this at higher levels from what i<br/>
hear), looks like all those mean orcys are going to chew on little old<br/>
me (I end up tanking in pick up groups a lot because so many tanks are<br/>
not good pullers and I get impatient).  No teleporter in the group? <br/>
Well guess who&#39;s going to get your group across the continent fastest? <br/>
No pet to sacrafice to that mob &quot;We thought we could kill it&quot;?  Oh wait<br/>
guess we can&#39;t help there... (unless you can charm FAST)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say it again at least at low levels a good tank(Monk in this case),<br/>
with a buffer (Shaman in this case) and a bard at his side in a darn<br/>
scary thing.  We had no trouble (even pulled desert trash some times)<br/>
holding the 4 derv camp this weekend and they are high blue/black/yellow<br/>
to us (with Thugs being red, I would kite them to half usually before<br/>
the monk would attack).  That was pretty sweet experience and loot... <br/>
(the shaman was at more than 2x her massive wt limit with bronze weapons<br/>
when we went to sell)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
