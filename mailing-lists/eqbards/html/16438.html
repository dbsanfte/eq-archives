&gt; Let me clear something up about the drop rates on Druzzil.  I assure you<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re no better than anywhere else - that&#39;s one reason I was so thrilled<br/>
&gt; at getting both gauntlets and arms in one trip.  In fact one of the drops<br/>
&gt; was from a patroller (pats we call &#39;em), the odds of which are very, very<br/>
&gt; close to zero.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you tell if it&#39;s a patroller?  I&#39;ve been trying to bind<br/>
sight with the puller, but there&#39;s no easy way I&#39;ve figured<br/>
out to tell.  There are static scorn banshees?  Where?<br/>

&gt; those 14 trips I have seen exactly FOUR pieces of Imbrued drop.  I was<br/>
&gt; fortunate enough in three of the cases to be the recipient of the item.<br/>
&gt; Therefore, I now have Breastplate, Arms and Gauntlets.  I got the BP on my<br/>
&gt; second trip about six weeks ago and have seen ZERO pieces drop until this<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just whipped up some code for a monte carlo simulation.  <br/>
Average number of drops required before you see all 7<br/>
different pieces is just over 18 (assuming all pieces drop<br/>
with equal probability).  So even if you&#39;re first in line for<br/>
all bard armor, you&#39;ll have to see 18 drops on average before<br/>
you have a full set (well, only one bracer, but most people<br/>
opt to substitute a hero or lambent for their second bracer).  <br/>
Seeing as the drop rate seems to average less than one per<br/>
trip, and you&#39;re talking about a long long time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; twice as often as anything else.  But when Planes capable players see my<br/>
&gt; armor there is no question in their minds about how difficult it was to get.<br/>
&gt; A lot of people complained pretty loudly that the armor resulting from the<br/>
&gt; Lambent (and other) armor quests was not NO DROP and just simply too easy to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If all armor planes armor were this rare I&#39;d have no problem<br/>
with it.  But they screwed up and tuned the armor drops on a<br/>
&quot;new pieces added per game day&quot; basis.  Because the respawn in<br/>
Hate is faster than Fear, that means the &quot;armor drop per<br/>
player-hour&quot; for Hate is much lower than for Fear.  So folks<br/>
with Fear armor go there, clear it over 5+ hours, then go on<br/>
to do other stuff (like sleep or play elsewhere) for the rest<br/>
of their time.  But for folks with Hate armor would have to<br/>
camp Hate 24 hours straight (due to the respawning wanderers)<br/>
to have the same shot at their armor.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the right choice from a world-balance standpoint, but<br/>
really screwed up for classes with Hate armor.<br/>
