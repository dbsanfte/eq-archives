<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022922781">I can&#39;t do it on my PC - but I&#39;ve been assured it is possible to twist 4<br/>
songs.  The people who do save have very fast high end machines (2.0 Ghz)<br/>
and I have an 800 Mhz so go figure).<br/>
Anywho - I had a guild member joking about a 6 song twist - his regular<br/>
four - plus BoH plus Amplification.<br/>
It all depends how you count.<br/>
