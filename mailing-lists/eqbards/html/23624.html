<br/>
To be honest I don&#39;t think people should get loot rights for a secondary.<br/>
If its a minor item, sure no problem, but major items which no one in the<br/>
group can use should not be taken by someone for a secondary.  Its not<br/>
really fair to the other people there.<br/>
<br/>
Of course saying you are going to use it then going and auctioning it is a<br/>
nother case entirely...</div>
