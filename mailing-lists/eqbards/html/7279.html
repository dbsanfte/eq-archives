<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413088685">Heh heh, good points.  I think the overall point was, and still is, that our<br/>
defensive melee skill do not allow us to be effective at what we need to do.<br/>
In fact we are no more effective at tanking than clerics.  Doesn&#39;t our Dodge<br/>
cap at 100?  Clerics caps at 80 as I recall so it isn&#39;t even a 45 pt<br/>
difference then.  We really should have some other defense skills since the<br/>
races that are bards cannot have the hitpoint and strength values that the<br/>
clerics and shamans have as a matter of course.  Our agility is also only<br/>
slightly better than the dwarves and barbarians, though we do outshine the<br/>
ogres and trolls.  Since higher agility has lesser rewards, having a 100<br/>
agility while someone else has an 85 isn&#39;t as much a difference as 100 str<br/>
vs 85 str.  Too bad I didn;t know that 17+ levels ago, no turning back now.<br/>
I wanted to be a I don&#39;t get hit much, but when I do it hurts, type of bard,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t seem to be possible with the reduced bonuses for high<br/>
agility.<br/>
<br/>
Against monsters we fare no better than clerics.  I am probably in the only<br/>
group where the cleric tanks and I play songs.  we tried it the other way<br/>
round but he was always oom from healing me to keep me alive.  This way he<br/>
gets beat up a bit but my healing song with lute keeps him from having to<br/>
use all his mana on healing eery fight.<br/>

Well, the way I&#39;d originally cast it, I was comparing bard<br/>
effectiveness against any monster, vs. cleric effectiveness<br/>
against any monster.  Somehow we lost the &quot;effectiveness<br/>
against any monster&quot; part and it became bard vs. cleric.  I<br/>
dunno how it became a melee-only contest too, maybe because I<br/>
was comparing defensive melee skills and someone dropped the<br/>
&quot;defensive&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
Since our offensive capability is melee-based whereas a<br/>
clerics is a magic/melee mix, I felt (and still feel) our<br/>
defensive melee capability needs to be better than theirs by<br/>
more than 45 dodge points.<br/>
