<div id="ygrps-yiv-734626516">i actually have a few questions about this stuff.<br/>
+1 str == +1 atk right?<br/>
<br/>
now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance to hit, and damage<br/>
done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then real damage<br/>
applied would also have to increase.<br/>
<br/>
anyone got a good link to the analysis done on this? <br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;And what good is STR on the earlier songs anyway? All the player studies<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve seen, which have been just as thorough as the work John Kim used to<br/>
&gt; &gt;do, show 50 str adds about 0.03% dmg over the long term. That&#39;s about as<br/>
&gt; &gt;impressive as a 2pt dmg sheild at L30.<br/>

&gt; &gt;[note to Shada, this is an addition to your post, not a reply ;)]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah, then why the heck are all the tanks going for STR stuff? Are they all <br/>
&gt;misguided? /shrug<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only reason I personally like more STR in equipment (not songs) is so <br/>
&gt;that I can carry more. I keep hearing that STR increases your damage in the <br/>
&gt;long run, but I&#39;ve never really watched this very closely.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, our haste song (to use the example of the enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeping 3 tanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasted) does have the added component of STR.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lol. Ah, yea. I never looked that far ahead in bard songs. Well when you <br/>
&gt;are grouped with an enchanter, you obviously aren&#39;t in the group for your <br/>
&gt;speed boost. Would Verses of Victory be a poor option for a level 54+ bard?<br/>
