&gt;Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  There were several<br/>
&gt;groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures.  The general<br/>
&gt;consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these creatures caused<br/>
&gt;Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>
&gt;enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant has started to<br/>
&gt;beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar additions in other<br/>
&gt;zones?  <br/>

the Vault a few weeks back about Equestrielle being slain!).  Equestrielle,<br/>
I gather (from the times I&#39;ve followed the unicorn) is just a wandering,<br/>
non-aggro high-level critter.  Crookstinger is rumoured to carry a magical<br/>
weapon - which is why it was being hunted, I&#39;m sure.  I&#39;d never heard of it<br/>
spawning before, so I assume that either 1) it&#39;s rare, or 2) it&#39;s been<br/>
reimplemented.<br/>
No clue about the fairie, though.<br/>
