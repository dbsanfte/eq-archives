<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409097992">When you enter Sol A, go down the lava bridge and around the path into the<br/>
room with the cracked wall.  If you are a smaller race, you can duck down<br/>
and climb directly through the crack right into the room.  If you go through<br/>
the door way in that room, you will see a pit with stairs and a door in<br/>
front of you and a hall to the left and to the right.  The hall to the right<br/>
leads to a room in Sol A where there are no spawns known as the Safe Room,<br/>
AKA Rug Room, AKA Teddy Bear Room... Get there and you&#39;ll see why.  It is an<br/>
extremely safe place to fight as you are quite literally next to a zone to<br/>
Sol B.  Get in trouble, zone away.  Send your puller off to get youngs,<br/>
cinders and flames and if you get a bad pull, zone away.  Once you get<br/>
comfortable in Sol A, you can head in further to some of the other<br/>
challenges like the Foreman & Predator... then probably bar, captain,<br/>
efreeti, kindle, exg, torturer, king, lava elemental, etc...  I quite<br/>
literally hunted in Sol A from levels 22 or so all the way up to level 37/38<br/>
and got enough stuff to get rich in the meantime.  The loot in Sol A is also<br/>
incredible, drakehide leggins and sleeves, drakescale belts, impskin gloves,<br/>
foreman&#39;s tunic, obsidian scimitar and shard, chared guardian shield and bp,<br/>
platinum armbands, blackened iron, etc.  Personally, I think it is the best<br/>
dungeon as far as appropriate loot given the amount of effort to get it.<br/>
Sure I did Najena, Unrest, MM, etc. during those levels too, but I always<br/>
came back to Sol A.<br/>
