<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an archery contest. It<br/>
 </span></blockquote>looks fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because, despite the discovery<br/>
of a bard usable bow<br/>
That bow being usable by bards was a mistake that was corrected a few<br/>
patches ago.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>except for bards.<br/>
<br/>
Well, bards have always been pretty much in their own category, making<br/>
something like this a bit difficult. Every melee capable class can out-melee<br/>
them, and their songs aren&#39;t really appropriate to put up versus spells.<br/>
Bards are probably the best example of a class that is balanced by<br/>
usefulness to the group as a primary concern, with offensive power being<br/>
further down the list.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any ideas how some type of test for bards could be laid out,<br/>
feel free to post your ideas here. I&#39;ll be happy to forward them to the<br/>
Event Master.<br/>
