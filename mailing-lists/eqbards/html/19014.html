<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333842580">Um. Kurn&#39;s Tower is going to be entirely green to 24 (except MAYBE<br/>
the Burnyai if you go down) At 20, Meara went with a group to Kurn&#39;s Tower<br/>
and it was combination of greens and easy blues. She didn&#39;t see one white in<br/>
the entire tower while they were there. They explored the whole area of the<br/>
skeletons. But, although they went down to the necro badgers underneath,<br/>
they didn&#39;t go very far into tem. All the badgers we saw were blue -- none<br/>
green. Which is why I say they may go higher.<br/>

&gt;I haven&#39;t used Lament much, having traveled a lot with<br/>
&gt;a druid who uses Harmony very well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now I am faced with going to Kurn&#39;s Tower with my<br/>
&gt;group, an undead, indoor dungeon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A member of my group is telling me lament won&#39;t work<br/>
&gt;against undead anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone tell me about this?  I&#39;m 24th lvl now and<br/>
&gt;have a charisma of 120.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
