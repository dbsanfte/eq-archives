<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357437103">A couple guildmates were in a full group at the lord.  I was<br/>
in Rathe hunting giants when I got the message that two spots<br/>
were opening up, and could we please hurry since they couldn&#39;t<br/>
hold the room with just 4 people.  So I zoned to Feerott,<br/>
was booted to the server selection screen, zoned to Innothule,<br/>
was booted to the login screen, you&#39;re all probably familiar<br/>
with this by now...<br/>
<br/>
A guild ranger who was already in Guk took the 5th spot.  I<br/>
got there and joined just as a patrolling dar spawned on top<br/>
of us.  That gave us a L45 paladin, L45 cleric, L42<br/>
shadowknight, L42 ranger, L44 bard (me), and another bard that<br/>
was anon and blue to me.  Not a very strong group for the lord<br/>
room, but you take what you can get.  Immediately after we<br/>
killed the dar, the lord spawned with a sword.  The other bard<br/>
and I hadn&#39;t had time to coordinate our songs, heck I didn&#39;t<br/>
even have any buffs on me.  I guess someone got excited and<br/>
pulled the lord, and we were committed.<br/>
<br/>
The ghoul lord slashes you for 135 damage.<br/>
The ghoul lord hits you for 105 damage.<br/>
You have been struck by the force of Ykesha. (75 points)<br/>
(and yes, that&#39;s one combat round)<br/>
<br/>
Ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch...<br/>
<br/>
The cleric went OOM, everyone finished at 1-3 bubbles, and the<br/>
SK had to use his harm touch at the end to get the lord to<br/>
stop beating on us and start running.<br/>
<br/>
I won the lotto for the sword.  At 10 minutes, it&#39;s the<br/>
quickest rare item camp I&#39;ve ever done.  It just beat out my<br/>
Wakizashi camp. :)  That one took about 15 minutes - cleared<br/>
our way to the maid room, killed the maid that was already<br/>
spawned, and I won the lotto for the fang which I combined<br/>
with a butler fang the guild got the previous night. (And yes,<br/>
I stuck around afterwards to help others get stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
The sword takes a lot of stamina.  Nowhere near as bad as with<br/>
my old barbed whip, but enough that I&#39;m almost out of stamina<br/>
at the end of a long fight.  The proc is nice.  First fight<br/>
after getting the sword, it proced 6 times.  :)  Later when we<br/>
had two guild groups there, I noticed when it proced a lot, my<br/>
group would get the kill; when it didn&#39;t proc much, the other<br/>
group would get the kill.  Spiffy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Rokenn for helping us hold the room throughout the<br/>
night (got two more Yaks which went to guild rangers to stop<br/>
them from using their train-causing ebonys), and thanks to<br/>
Ariell for giving me her old Mistmoore drum to replace the one<br/>
I dropped.<br/>
