<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931205385">OK, some details on the running of of gnomes...<br/>
<br/>
Make a first-level gnome on E&#39;ci.  Give him/her a name beginning with Gn, <br/>
preferably followed by your bard&#39;s name (e.g. Gnkitasi, Gnaloro).<br/>
<br/>
Meet at noon PST this Friday (11/26/99) in Ak&#39;Anon.  We have offers of <br/>
teleports, and will try to get everyone rounded up and bound in Freeport for <br/>
the run.  I understand that some people can&#39;t be there then, but we all have <br/>
scheduling problems, and some people can&#39;t make it at other times.  Once <br/>
gathered in Freeport, we will run to lavastorm and hurl ourselves into the <br/>
lava pits en masse.<br/>
<br/>
So far about a dozen people have responded...  I&#39;d really like to see this <br/>
bring the EQ bardic community together, as much as possible.  I&#39;ve posted <br/>
this information on the bard boards I frequent, and will send it into the <br/>
spoiler sites soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there!<br/>
