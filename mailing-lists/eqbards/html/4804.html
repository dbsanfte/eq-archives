<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029320750">Probably we have been nerfed.  Of course in my duel, the lag was not exactly<br/>
ideal, like I said.  I am certain that Lullaby no longer &quot;Nixes S. List.&quot;  I<br/>
have seen a noticeable change in the way this song behaves.  Grouped with a<br/>
rogue, we made quite a team with this song and a backstab... no longer.  Try<br/>
dueling the caster again.  I cannot see any melee class winning a duel with<br/>
a caster!  Casters rule EverQuest, plain and simple.<br/>

&gt;Wow that seemed od to me friend.  I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>
&gt;I was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>
&gt;silly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>
&gt;into him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>
&gt;dirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>
&gt;weapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>
&gt;did.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>
&gt;interrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>
&gt;was getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>
&gt;enough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>
&gt;too powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>
&gt;of envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>
&gt;never felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>
