<div id="ygrps-yiv-368101059">Heh, an interesting story from a friend in Beta Phase 3. He was running<br/>
around kiting something in South Ro and he saw a small spider in front of<br/>
him that sorta looked like it was climbing over a distant hill. He thought<br/>
to himself &#39;Damn, that perspective&#39;s messed up&#39;. Thinking it might have been<br/>
some squirrely beta display code he continued kiting and forgot about the<br/>
spider. That is until he got the &#39;Terrorantula hits you for XX damage&#39; at<br/>
which point he spun around and saw a leg, just a leg, on his screen. He<br/>
didn&#39;t take the time to look up as he was quickly fleeing to the zone line.<br/>

	Good Journey,<br/>
