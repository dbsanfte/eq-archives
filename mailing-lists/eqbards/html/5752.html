&gt; How could I possibly know all this???  Well, you yourself can ask Brad<br/>
&gt; McQuaid next time you meet him at Gencon or somewhere.  I asked if JM was at<br/>
&gt; the con and Brad certainly knew his name and told me he was a beta tester<br/>
&gt; they got to know very well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you posted this as I had also heard it but my source wasn&#39;t<br/>
quite as unimpeachable as yours so I didn&#39;t want to get into a big flame<br/>
war about it. My same source (another beta tester from P2 on) also said<br/>
JM&#39;s main char through most of beta was a rogue. Still, he seemed to<br/>
know a fair bit about bards and had some useful information. Shame he<br/>
seems to be gone.<br/>
