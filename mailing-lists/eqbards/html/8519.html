 </span></blockquote>Then I have been misinformed by hundreds of people I talk to<br/>
across every single server.  I have never heard of a two man<br/>
team doing the castle reliably, you must have got really lucky.  <br/>
<br/>
Parties of full L50s have had to evac from the castle.<br/>
And I know for sure that L40-45 parties are vulernable.<br/>
<br/>
If it was as easy as you say, then there would be a lot<br/>
more Soulfires and EBWs and Nightshade Wreaths floating<br/>
around.  People are &#39;afraid&#39; of the castle and for good<br/>
reason.  It&#39;s not the picnic people make it out to be.<br/>
<br/>
However:  I will give you this, that in wolf form you <br/>
could invade the castle, harmony everything, and possibly<br/>
pull and kill one thing at a time.  If that&#39;s the ticket,<br/>
then I understand your point.  But to a group with no<br/>
pack wolf form, trains are the ultimate killer.<br/>
