 </span></blockquote>Yes, plate helms look silly on humans too. :P You end up looking like a big<br/>
pencil-eraser-head person.<br/>
<br/>
I would sugguest getting a helm that has no graphic. I&#39;m not sure I can<br/>
suggest too many that are attainable at your level... you could get a<br/>
savant&#39;s cap pretty easily, but I guess it isn&#39;t too useful for a bard.<br/>
There is a silk turban that comes off a rare named giant I believe, and<br/>
while that would be nice, it is very rare.<br/>
<br/>
But, getting something without a graphic is my advice. Perhaps others on the<br/>
list can suggest good things. My wood elf female bard is wearing a savant&#39;s<br/>
cap - to avoid those terrible Spock ears. =)<br/>
