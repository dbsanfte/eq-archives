I know this doesn&#39;t affect bards since we can&#39;t use bows, but something<br/>
Abashi said raises a question.<br/>
<br/>
I was never aware that primary and secondary attacks were delayed after<br/>
casting a spell.  In other words, you temporarily stop swinging for X number<br/>
of seconds after casting a spell.  X is the your weapon DLY/10.  <br/>
<br/>
So does this affects bards?  We are constantly weaving songs so do we also<br/>
stop swinging for X amount of seconds after our songs start?  I&#39;ve never<br/>
really noticed it myself so am inclined to believe this does not affect us.<br/>
Can someone confirm?<br/>
