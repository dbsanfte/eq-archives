<div id="ygrps-yiv-308101214">I&#39;m still around but took the last 2 weeks off for back to school and<br/>
various other stuff. My plan was to get everything around the house caught<br/>
up and maybe a bit ahead before PoP, but now it looks like I will need to<br/>
get back on the raid horse. I really don&#39;t care for raid level stuff, all<br/>
hurry up and wait. Plus I finally got a new job and have to log at a<br/>
reasonable hour. Being on EST, that means I have to go about the time we get<br/>
really started in VT or wherever. Songs are the only thing I care about<br/>
having though so it&#39;s back to grind, I suppose.<br/>
