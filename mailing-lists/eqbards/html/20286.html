<div id="ygrps-yiv-51756716">Something wrong with a PII 200 with 64 MB RAM?  Heh heh.  (Evulia tosses a<br/>
few more copper into a pig-shaped container crafted by a master potter and<br/>
inscribed with the words &quot;New toys!  Must have new toys!!&quot;)  Funny you<br/>
should mention it though, because I DO have a TNT Ultra 2 w/ 32 SDRAM.  That<br/>
was my most recent upgrade.  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW on Tunare and excluding Kunark, Blackburrow is the laggiest low-level<br/>
zone in the game.  I&#39;ve never played there without hearing at least one<br/>
player comment on it.  I&#39;ve spent less time in Crushbone but I suspect it is<br/>
a close second.  Both areas are comparable to Freeport bank and the gates of<br/>
Qeynos.  <br/>
<br/>
As for Kunark, I played an Iksar only up to level 2 1/2, but IIRC Cabalis<br/>
was fine and Field of Bone was about the same as Blackburrow.  Perhaps<br/>
that&#39;s why I stopped after 2 1/2 levels.  <br/>

&gt; Woah!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; you feel Blackburrow is such a good dungeon for bards.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found it to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to <br/>
&gt; successfully hunt there<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Peace<br/>

&gt; Evulia,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What system are you using?  If you&#39;re having problems in <br/>
&gt; Blackburrow you<br/>
&gt; really need to consider upgrading your system.  The lag there <br/>
&gt; should be<br/>
&gt; minimal, if any.  If you&#39;re having that kind of problem in <br/>
&gt; Blackburrow I<br/>
&gt; dread to think how bad kunark is going to be for you :(  Might want to<br/>
&gt; consider picking up a TNT 2 Ultra with 32mb ram.  You can get <br/>
&gt; them for a<br/>
&gt; song these days (around $70-$150) and maybe some more ram for <br/>
&gt; your computer<br/>
&gt; (128mb ram is great for EQ)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just some helpful hints.  If you&#39;re having that much trouble <br/>
&gt; with BB I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; suspect your system is kind of lower-end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this is helpful.<br/>
