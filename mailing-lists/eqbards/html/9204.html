<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295006381">You&#39;re missing the argument.  Mobs hate based on &quot;spells&quot;   The reason I<br/>
think it &quot;seems&quot; that there is bard hate - we cast a lot more &quot;spells&quot; than<br/>
casters since we have no mana requirements.  Add to that - I&#39;m guessing that<br/>
system counts each pulse as an additional casting.  I also guess that group<br/>
songs count once per person in the group.  As far as I am aware - all other<br/>
classes buffs only affect a target (and probably is cast while you&#39;re not in<br/>
agro range).<br/>
<br/>
So you can see how this can multiply causing the bard to go way up on the<br/>
&quot;hate list&quot; without an automatic bard-hate.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t believe the bard-hate theory.  I think it is more related<br/>
to idiosyncrasies of the class balance.  I seemed to suffer from it at lower<br/>
level - but never see it happening to me now.  I tend to group a lot with a<br/>
Druid and Cleric above me in levels.  I saw the so-called bard-hate a lot up<br/>
to the late-teens - never see it any more.  I think this &quot;problem&quot; occurs<br/>
most in tank-heavy groups.  I&#39;m guessing the &quot;spell&quot; factor weighs heavier<br/>
than damage...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Verant isn&#39;t telling us the details - so we can only guess...<br/>

&gt; Not to argue semantics, but if all bard songs cause<br/>
&gt; mobs to hate us and we are the only class that has<br/>
&gt; songs, doesn&#39;t that equate to bard hate?<br/>
