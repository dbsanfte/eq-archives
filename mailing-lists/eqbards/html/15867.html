&gt;&gt;      I lost my mystic shielding or elemental icon immediately<br/>

&gt;&gt;      from all NPCs, just stated what I fought for reference.<br/>

&gt;&gt;      It&#39;s really ridiculous, any spell that hits me cancels the<br/>
&gt;&gt;      resist shield from the song.  It&#39;s like not playing any<br/>
&gt;&gt;      protection song at all, because everything hits for full<br/>
&gt;&gt;      since the shield drops due to the attack.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sounds like a bug.  It should only be happening with Niv&#39;s, as<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s the only song that&#39;s supposed to have a spell damage<br/>
&gt;shield (once the shield absorbs the damage, the shield/song<br/>
&gt;drops).  If it&#39;s happening with other resist songs, I&#39;d /bug<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. This isn&#39;t happening for me. Fighting in Oasis, having<br/>
casting desert madmen. I sing Purifying Rhythms (have that one<br/>
up for Snakes and Mummies we are also fighting. luckily both have Magic<br/>
Resist) It does NOT fade when the ignites, etc from the<br/>
caster madmen hit us---me. :)<br/>
