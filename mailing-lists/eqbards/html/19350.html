<div id="ygrps-yiv-235468138">This whole thread has become meaningless.  I will no longer be reading any<br/>
posts in this thread, nor responding to them.   Plus I am on the verge of<br/>
canceling my membership to this list.  This entire agruement has been the<br/>
stupidest thing I have read in ages.  I feel that some of you are argueing<br/>
for the sake of arguing, nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Good bye<br/>
