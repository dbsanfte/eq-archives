<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081498030">I have also found that you cannot purchase two songs. Well, you can but the<br/>
second song never makes it into inventory. If you are going on a song run<br/>
for yourself and a friend bard I&#39;d suggest buying your&#39;s, scribing it, and<br/>
then buying your friend&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
	As for what Lament does, for a very brief period of time the creature will<br/>
act as if it doesn&#39;t know you are there. This is good for those things that<br/>
are &quot;KOS&quot; (Kill On Sight) that attack you when you get close. Also if you<br/>
come across a group of four creatures, play it on three, then attack the<br/>
fourth, the other three are much less likely to help out their comrade.<br/>

OK, I made the trip to the Elven land last night to purchase<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lament (I purchased Cinda&#39;s Carillion too, to save<br/>
another trip).  I hope everybody is aware that unscribed songs<br/>
on your person will disappear upon your death.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tried using it (lament, that is), and besides &quot;&lt;creature&gt;<br/>
looks sad&quot; or just pissing it off and making it come at me, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out what it does.<br/>
Also I noticed that it only lasts a single beat if it works.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what Lament does, and what it&#39;s useful for?<br/>
