<div id="ygrps-yiv-488072739">Even though I really like our guild Robynn, I have learned not to rely on<br/>
them for anything.  I realize your not saying that you do...but if I find<br/>
myself grouped with a guildmate its usually because of coincidence.  No one<br/>
from our guild has ever come to my aid because I asked, only if it was<br/>
convenient. I tend to just try and make as many casual friends as I can as I<br/>
wander about and the ones that remember me later are usually the ones that I<br/>
remember too...I have lived all the way to 35 on utterly random pick-up<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to mention that even though lots of folks here say the lambent<br/>
is mostly attainable at your level, it really wasn&#39;t meant to be, IMHO.  At<br/>
level 28 you have a heck of a lot more pieces than yours truly.  Take a<br/>
break from the lambent questing, do other things...be flexible when you log<br/>
on and don&#39;t make it your sole focus to pursue the armor every time - most<br/>
everything that comes my way does so because I am in the right place at the<br/>
right time...sort of like real life ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not preaching...just kindly words of encouragement from a concerned fellow<br/>
bard and guildmate.<br/>
<br/>
cheers!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It really make me wonder what I am putting all this work <br/>
&gt; into. While for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up <br/>
&gt; with the world&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to <br/>
&gt; think about hanging<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my biggest problem with the game.  I&#39;m level 28 and up until<br/>
&gt; this point, my boyfriend and I could just go around and hunt in a pair<br/>
&gt; and make decent exp.  Together, we have acquired a full set of crafted<br/>
&gt; for him and an almost complete set of lambent for myself (I&#39;m missing<br/>
&gt; the helm, bp, and boots right now).  Yes, for some of this, we joined<br/>
&gt; a larger group or, in his case, bought 2 or 3 pieces that we couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get ourselves.  Lately, we&#39;ve had a wizard from my guild join us, so I<br/>
&gt; basically have a regular 3 person group.  This is not enough to do<br/>
&gt; much of anything anymore.  At our level (my 28, wiz 28, bf 30) ,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s not much to kill outdoors and breaking into a decent spot in a<br/>
&gt; dungeon requires a full group.  So, here&#39;s my little grouping<br/>
&gt; mini-rant.  Two nights ago, we took over the Permafrost king room from<br/>
&gt; a level 50 who was looking for a cloak.  I sat in a preacher room<br/>
&gt; group until the rest showed up; the rest being my 2 regulars and a<br/>
&gt; friend of the wizard who had grouped with us a couple of times before.<br/>
&gt; We waited at least 2 hours to take the room over, not counting the<br/>
&gt; time it took them to get a teleport from Unrest to North Karana and<br/>
&gt; run to Permafrost.  Once the room was secured, we were fine.  An honor<br/>
&gt; guard spawned with a 2 hander and we let the wiz&#39;s roll, since they<br/>
&gt; had helped us out before and hadn&#39;t really gotten any of the good<br/>
&gt; stuff.  The non-regular won, and shortly thereafter, deserted us while<br/>
&gt; we were trying to find his replacement.  Note to self:  my regular<br/>
&gt; group is not enough to hold the room.  The high priest spawned and<br/>
&gt; killed all 3 of us, starting with the nuker.  After corpse retrieval,<br/>
&gt; with the help of a really nice level 47 druid from my guild, it was<br/>
&gt; 12:30am and I was back where I started for the night.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is typical of my experiences lately.  Either we can&#39;t find enough<br/>
&gt; people to take a room in a dungeon or we can, but can&#39;t find a room to<br/>
&gt; take.  And once we finally take the room, someone has to leave so<br/>
&gt; we either have to find a replacement quickly or leave the room<br/>
&gt; ourselves.  At least most people who have to leave warn us enough<br/>
&gt; ahead of time that the new person arrives as soon as they disband. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve started to feel like I&#39;m wasting my time playing. Sure,<br/>
&gt; occasionally I&#39;ll have a really great time (Gnomestock was a blast,<br/>
&gt; and once I was in a group killing the diplomat in Permafrost which was<br/>
&gt; great), but those times are few and far between now.  Even being in a<br/>
&gt; guild doesn&#39;t seem to help much...Does anyone have any ideas on how to<br/>
&gt; make this feel more worthwhile?  <br/>
