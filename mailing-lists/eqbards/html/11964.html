<div id="ygrps-yiv-556967680">Once you attack a mob (or aid someone attacking him) you get out on his<br/>
&quot;hate list.&quot;  Then depending on your proximity to him - he attacks you.<br/>
Line of sight and some distance or agro range may also figure in.  Couple<br/>
days ago - I got a bad pull on Froon & Choon and lost hp so I decided to<br/>
zone and heal rather than risk a death.  I Selo&#39;s off to the east and soon<br/>
enough was far enough away from them that the decided to go back to their<br/>
little hill and do whatever they do up there.  Since I out ran them, I could<br/>
stay in zone and heal up - as it was my intent to go back and get them<br/>
anyhow and did not need to zone nor camp to clear the agro list.<br/>
<br/>
One time I was trying to find my way to Sol-A at an age where fire<br/>
elementals would still agro on me.  One did and the nasty greenie burned me<br/>
down bad.  I was kinda new to lavastorm and ran off in a panic not able to<br/>
find a zone.  So, I just ran out of their agro range and camped to clear the<br/>
hate list.  The reason to clear the list is so that if you do happen to get<br/>
back near them - you wont get attacked because they have &#39;forgotten&#39; about<br/>
you by now.  <br/>
<br/>
Your target bar is only updated when you are within a certain distance<br/>
range.  You need to be fairly close to the mob to see current condition.<br/>
Although once you target, you can run across the zone and still get a &#39;con&#39;<br/>
of the mob to see if he is green, blue, or what.<br/>
<br/>
Grats on your levels - Misty is good for those 8, 9, 10 - even to 12 or so.<br/>

		On this mobs giving up the chase...<br/>
<br/>
		How does this work?<br/>
<br/>
		I have been killing giant scarabs in Misty (got lvls 8,9 an<br/>
10<br/>
		yesterday!!!!) and sometimes they seem to just give up the<br/>
chase.  THey<br/>
		are still alive (on my target bar)  but never show up...<br/>
