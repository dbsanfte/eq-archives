enchanter and someone who can cast harmony.  I only counted 6<br/>
goblins - four in each corner of the tower, two in the top.  <br/>
You can Lament them (which I did for the first few pulls), but<br/>
it takes a lot of time to swim around getting the four<br/>
corners, then swimming up so I could lull the two inside the<br/>
tower.  By the time I finished this, pulled, fought, and<br/>
rested from the fight, the tower was fully spawned again and I<br/>
had to repeat the entire process.<br/>
<br/>
So ideally you&#39;ll want someone to cast harmony to lull<br/>
everything at once, then pull.  If you overpull (which is<br/>
pretty easy), you&#39;ll want the enchanter to mez the<br/>
extras.  This will save you enough time that the gobs won&#39;t<br/>
respawn by the time you&#39;re ready for the next pull.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem are the casters.  Not only do they like to<br/>
stand back and nuke, they like to stand back and shoot arrows<br/>
at you, so they&#39;re even less likely to run within melee range<br/>
of your group.  I think this is why most people pull to the<br/>
zone - so they aren&#39;t nuked by a caster that&#39;s still at the<br/>
water&#39;s edge out of sight.  You&#39;ll want a full-time healer if<br/>
your group is in the 30s.  If the group is in the 40s you<br/>
should be ok with just a paladin doing the healing, as you<br/>
won&#39;t take as much damage from the nukes.<br/>
<br/>
The helms seem to drop pretty often.  I&#39;d say about 1 in 5<br/>
goblins has one.  We got 9 last night.  3 for bards, one for a<br/>
paladin who thought it&#39;d be neat to have a black helm, and we<br/>
let 5 rot.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this being an open zone, be aware that once you break<br/>
the spawn, people who are soloing will come down to pull<br/>
goblins.  Usually the spawn is fast enough that this isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem.  But if someone is being a jerk about it, just sit<br/>
back for a few minutes and let the tower respawn.  That&#39;ll<br/>
remind them who&#39;s in control of the situation.<br/>
