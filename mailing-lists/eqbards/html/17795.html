&gt; Personally I have had great relations with GMs/Guides.  The only one I ever<br/>

&gt; Karana though :(  Our current GM (DeSani) is kind of a nut though.  He keeps<br/>

DeSani) were running around as tadpoles attacking people for 1<br/>
point of damage.  They had a ton of hp, and when some necro<br/>
managed to kill one of them, they brought out a huge tadpole<br/>
called the froglok avenger, double-attacking for 100+,<br/>
backstabbing for 400+.  I have a ton of screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, DeSani is a nut.  :)  Was a lot of fun to watch,<br/>
although a couple people were killed because they had some<br/>
flags that caused all nearby NPCs to attack anyone who attcked<br/>
them.<br/>
