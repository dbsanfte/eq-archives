<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875575123">Gah!  Only if it happened since last nite as I died and was able to put mine<br/>
back on.  If this trend continues there will be no items in the game that<br/>
bards can use.  Right now all the cool items I have come from quests from<br/>
other races/classes that I can do because of carillion, except for<br/>
Crookstinger of course!  When I saw the new armor from the ogre head quest I<br/>
was devastated.  That armor clad me well when I was lower level and I could<br/>
not have gotten it without the generosity of those fine dwarves.  Apparently<br/>
rather than take the needed step of making items break Verant has decided to<br/>
merely make everything limited to classes or races.  So much for variation<br/>
and so much for meaningful quests.  Bards already have next to zero quests<br/>
worth doing, I got a wonderful Chant of Battle scroll from the Broken Lute<br/>
quest, yet the Qeynos Cleric/Paladin Cure quest nets you a wonderful magic<br/>
weapon.  If Verant continues to make quests totally specific to the various<br/>
classes in their rewards and applications then I will be truly thru with<br/>
this game.  Quests are the one thing that keeps me playing, I love doing<br/>
them and getting the reward is a nice second benefit.  I do a lot of quests<br/>
for items I can&#39;t use already, but if all the quests were like that...  I<br/>
would imagine their next step would be to make all quest rewards no drop.<br/>
That would really be the last straw as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Can anyone say<br/>

Careful with this quest Galtin, much like the new bloodforge armor that has<br/>
replaced the blackened as a reward for the ogre heads quest in BB/Kaladim, I<br/>
hear that the raider cap is now Halfling only.<br/>

&gt; Since this item is nice for a bard to have (+10 CHR),  I <br/>
&gt; would like to get<br/>
&gt; some help with it from this list.<br/>

&gt; Marshall Anrey in Rivervale gives you this quest.  It <br/>
&gt; requires you to give<br/>
&gt; him a dragoon dirk. In return, he will give you the <br/>
&gt; leatherfoot raider cap.<br/>
&gt; According to some spoiler sites, you have to give him a polar <br/>
&gt; bear skin/hide<br/>
&gt; (can&#39;t remember which) first before you can do the <br/>
&gt; leatherfoot raider cap<br/>
&gt; quest.  I thought I had read a long time ago on this list <br/>
&gt; that you could<br/>
&gt; bypass the first quest and just give him the dirk from the <br/>
&gt; outset.  I tried<br/>
&gt; that last night and ended up losing my dragoon dirk without <br/>
&gt; getting the cap.<br/>
&gt; Can someone who has completed the leatherfoot raider cap <br/>
&gt; quest tell me how<br/>
&gt; they did it?  Also, the Marshall conned amiably to me and I <br/>
&gt; was singing the<br/>
&gt; carillion when I gave him the dirk.  That didn&#39;t make a difference.   <br/>
