<div id="ygrps-yiv-229930811">Well, they sure are NOT introducing horses to help cut down on travel time,<br/>
they&#39;ve already said that. In a recent chat, Verant said that the Horse&#39;s<br/>
will have the approximate speed of J-Boots / T-Boots. If they were bring<br/>
horses on to help with travel times, a horse would be faster because if the<br/>
horses are going to be in the 15,000 platinum range if you can buy T-Boots<br/>
for 5,250 platinum? The real reason they are introducing horses is because<br/>
Verant has always wanted horses and they think the horses they&#39;ve created<br/>
look GREAT. The horses are just for the coolness factor.<br/>

	I have heard that the zones are going to be huge like Western<br/>
Karana, after<br/>
	all why else would they introduce horses?<br/>
