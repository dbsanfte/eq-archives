<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298546690">I have yet to be killed in Kith except for one time when I zoned in from RV <br/>
into a train so i zoned back, only to fall for 10k of damage. Ive done 3 solo <br/>
body recoveries for people that have taken me pretty deep into the wood, I <br/>
did 2 at night, and was never once attacked. We have it alot easier than some <br/>
do.<br/>
Heres some of my strategies for living. <br/>
1) Selo&#39;s of course<br/>
2) Have Guardian rhythems memmed. When i play this with a regular drum my MR <br/>
jumps to 80 something or other. <br/>
3) Have invis memmed too. Not everything there can see invis<br/>
4) As most have said stay on the wall.<br/>
5) Don&#39;t be so afraid of the place!!! If you go in expecting to die, you are <br/>
most likely gonna.<br/>
<br/>
People need to just get over it; Kith is now a high level zone now. Take <br/>
precautions and there is no need for all this whining.<br/>
