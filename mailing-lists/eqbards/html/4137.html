 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve said over and over one of the reasons the bard class<br/>
appeals to people like me is that there is no simple answer to<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s the best way to play?&quot;  I give my thoughts on what<br/>
various songs do, I list what song combos I&#39;ve found seem to<br/>
be effective, but I have *never* said that such and such three<br/>
songs are the best to play at a certain level.  Why?  I&#39;ve<br/>
said over and over, &quot;IT DEPENDS.&quot;  Reading this list gets you<br/>
the info, but it is up to you and your experience with others,<br/>
different mobs, equipment, and situations to determine what<br/>
works best in what situation.<br/>
<br/>
If you deprive yourself of some of that experience by killing<br/>
just the same mobs over and over to powerlevel, or twink so<br/>
you never push the envelope of what the bard is capable of,<br/>
you will not learn the full scope of play strategies available<br/>
to us.  If you&#39;re not into fully experiencing the class,<br/>
that&#39;s fine - it&#39;s a personal decision.  But if it&#39;s something<br/>
you do want, then be careful of taking shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Good judgement comes from experience.  Experience comes from<br/>
bad judgement.<br/>
