<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014184750">With the nerf, I think charm is more of a crowd control thing than ever before.  Soloing is now a much riskier, long term venture than before because you have to stop, target a mob, command it -- switch back to your pet and run every 12 seconds or so.  Those extra commands eat into your charm time and your mana.<br/>
<br/>
What I try to do for crowd control is to charm something not attacking me.  it takes out the &quot;charmee&quot; and whatever is pounding on me atm.  Meantime, I am singing Verses of Celerity (which I like better than Berserker Frenzy) and psalm of cooling (I am in Velius and damage shields take on a whole new significance there).  Party buffs are never resisted and you are taking out two mobs with half the chance of a resist.  You can keep the one mob targeted all the time as well.<br/>
<br/>
Drawback to charm-crowd control tho is yellows and above are unaffected -- so be sure to con before you charm or you&#39;ll have yet another angry mob pulverizing the bard.<br/>

Hmm, I&#39;m not exactly sure what my cha is, but I&#39;m pretty sure its under 125,<br/>
and I dont have too much trouble messing something.  I SUCK at charming,<br/>
find it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>
mana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>
reliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>
I&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>
nivs and try to mitigate damage.  But thats just me, maybe I need to learn<br/>
the right way to charm.<br/>
