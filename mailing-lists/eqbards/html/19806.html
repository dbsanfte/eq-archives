<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] wedding cake recipie....i think <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-786707401">That&#39;s the recipie that&#39;s floating around but nobody can try it as<br/>
there aren&#39;t 10 slot ovens anywhere. :(  Everyone was putting their<br/>
money on the Always Works oven in Droga but even that one is just 6<br/>
slot.  Someone once mentioned a quest involving HK that you needed to<br/>
bake a wedding cake for.  In that quest you got a cake recipie.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been wondering if it might have something to do with the Halfling<br/>
Wedding plotline/questmaybe.  There seem to be a handfull of quests<br/>
that involve both HP and Rivervale.  At least one *wink*.  Tho, if<br/>
someone does find a 10 slot oven.. LET US KNOW!!!!!<br/>

&gt; i hope *crosses fingers* that this is somewhat accurate and that<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; able to discover the true recipie by the weddings<br/>
