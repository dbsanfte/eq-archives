<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083662231">I&#39;m surprised that everyone is so shocked by this, or that they didn&#39;t <br/>
realise it happened.  &#39;The Dark Path&#39; to me is as much a part of Norrathian <br/>
life as any other.  If we can roleplay our rebirth after every death, then <br/>
roleplaying this mode of transportation should present no further <br/>
difficulties.  The one thing I have learned from this list, however, is that <br/>
it can be done without experience penalties.  I&#39;ve only ever used it as a <br/>
last resort when needing to quickly get from one side of the world to the <br/>
other, but always with the understanding that I would lose a certain amount <br/>
of experience.<br/>
<br/>
Being a bard, my roleplaying extends to the following song, written as a <br/>
warning to other guild members who may be tempted:<br/>
<br/>
The Dark Path<br/>
<br/>
A shadow follows ev&#39;ry step,<br/>
A demon tastes the air.<br/>
They wait for those who take the path,<br/>
They wait within their lair.<br/>
<br/>
They watch the silent souls go by,<br/>
For those whose minds are slow.<br/>
For those whose steps are filled with fear,<br/>
For those who do not know.<br/>
<br/>
An innocent upon the path,<br/>
May never reach the end.<br/>
A silent shadow in the night,<br/>
&#39;gainst which they can&#39;t defend.<br/>
<br/>
So heed the warning, go by light,<br/>
Just walk, where e&#39;er you go.<br/>
Dark paths are fast for those prepared,<br/>
But death awaits the slow.<br/>

&gt;From a roleplaying point of view it is utterly ridiculous.<br/>

&gt;Well if it works it does sound like the fastest way to travel between<br/>
&gt;continents.  No more waiting for the boat:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How would someone go about doing this to themselves?  I would guess that <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;only way we could kill ourselves without causing EXP loss would be with <br/>
&gt;DDD,<br/>
&gt;CofD, or bellow.  I have never tried targetting myself with these so have <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;idea if they damage you or not.  I thought I read somewhere that if you die<br/>
&gt;from a DOT cast my a player while dueling you will still take an EXP loss.<br/>
&gt;This could apply here also so you would only want to use it to get yourself<br/>
&gt;very low and then bellow from there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, if this method does work, it only goes to show you that players will<br/>
&gt;always figure out a way to do something that the game designer never<br/>
&gt;contemplated.  While it would definately be an exploit, I would term it an<br/>
&gt;ingenious exploit and not a stupid one:-).<br/>
