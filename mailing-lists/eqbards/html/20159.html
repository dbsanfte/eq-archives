&gt;with a Lute I literally cannot do anything else until Lullaby is no longer<br/>
&gt;needed.  I may as well walk off and get a sandwich.  At least if I could<br/>
&gt;swing my weapons I be doing something other than just watching the screen<br/>
&gt;waiting till we were down to one mob.  Now if Lullaby required a Lute and<br/>
&gt;lasted two ticks I&#39;d be ecstatic about the change.  Then I could argue with<br/>
&gt;all my elist friends over what song was best to twist in between rounds of<br/>
&gt;Lullaby. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s the whole point.  if we could lullaby and do other stuff, we&#39;d have exactly<br/>
the same power as an enchanter to ae mez (and gained at a much lower level) and<br/>
be able to wear armor.  we&#39;re not supposed to be able to be as good as an<br/>
enchanter at crowd control.  besides, you could lullaby and punch.  i do 10-12<br/>
points of damage when i punch things.  i just don&#39;t see what swinging weapons<br/>
gains you in interest level.  let&#39;s say you could use weapons in this hypothetical<br/>
lullaby situation.  so you hit lullaby, hit assist, hit &#39;a&#39;, and now what?  you do<br/>
exactly the same as you would if you had a lute instead of weapons.  you sit<br/>
and watch the screen.  you could just as easily go get a sandwich then too.<br/>
heck, my sk buddy does that all the time.  we start up combat, he starts attacking<br/>
and then says afk, heh.<br/>
<br/>
best song at level 30 would be start battle with chains, switch to hymn when you<br/>
start getting pounded on, then back to chains when the primary target was ready to<br/>
run.<br/>
