&gt; Does anyone know if combine rapiers exist?<br/>
&gt; and if so, where to get one?  I&#39;ve looked in oasis and N. Karana<br/>
&gt; without luck.<br/>

spears, and a few other interesting combine weapons, can be found at the<br/>
gypsy camp in the Lavastorm Mountains.  I believe I paid 53 plat for one,<br/>
and I&#39;ve found it more than worth it.  The camp can be a little tricky to<br/>
find,<br/>
and the fire elementals in the area seem to have a thing against bards (or<br/>
maybe just me), so travel with a trustworthy party and someone who knows<br/>
the area.<br/>
