<div id="ygrps-yiv-699934437">First off, does your warrior know to taunt the bandits off of you? If not this can<br/>
really save your skin so get him to.  Also with the druid/ranger combo send the<br/>
rangers (sow&#39;ed) to pull for the group, and have the warrior & other ranger stand<br/>
so the MOB&#39;s will have to go through tanks to get to the bards.  This way the MOB<br/>
will get attacked by tanks & may forget about you.  You might also see if druid can<br/>
lull a few before pull.  Also make sure that non-melee&#39;er &quot;help&quot; the tank take out<br/>
one of the MOB&#39;s when they aren&#39;t casting.<br/>
<br/>
As for songs, I don&#39;t see if you were using inst & h2h or singing & weapons during<br/>
the battle.  I would try experimenting w/ using weapons vs. insts.  W/ two bards if<br/>
you are both using inst decide who will use drum & who lute.  The lute should play<br/>
Hymn and Chords (start twist w/ Chord just before MOB reach party & they will &quot;run<br/>
into&quot; your song).  The other bard w/ drum should do Anthem/Elemental (or Selo&#39;s if<br/>
a real long battle) till you get 12th, then the Anthem/Bellow twist.  The bard<br/>
using the lute will be the most popular, so you may want to stop & switch<br/>
songs/inst to even out damage between bards.  If not have druid save enough mana to<br/>
do 1 or 2 heals on bard.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

&gt; We tried the camp a total of three times, some of us dying every time.<br/>
&gt; There were(I think) 5 bandits, all blue, except for one, which was yellow.<br/>
&gt; The first time I had the misfortune to be playing Hymn twisted with Anthem<br/>
&gt; from the beginning of the fight, and I ended up with three bandits on me due, I<br/>
&gt; think to Hymn. Needless to say, I died. It was a fun run of shame back to<br/>
&gt; my body...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The second time we tried it, we were actually jumped -- a pair of<br/>
&gt; bandits running by started the fray, and the five from the camp<br/>
&gt; joined the fun. This time the other Bard was killed; he was playing<br/>
&gt; Hymn. When I noticed his health dropping rapidly, I told him to back<br/>
&gt; off, and he did, but the bandits didn&#39;t stop. Is there anything I could<br/>
&gt; have done to pull them off of him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The third time, again there were 7 bandits. A ranger shot at a bandit<br/>
&gt; in the camp and those 5 ran at us, and two more running by at the same<br/>
&gt; time joined the fray. This time, I decided to use Discord, rather then Hymn<br/>
&gt; to try to do extra damage. I liked seeing 7 messages &quot;a bandit winces&quot;! But<br/>
&gt; once again, I managed to get the attention of a pair of bandits, and died. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; asked the other Bard to play Elemental Rhythms, as there was a yellow bandit<br/>
&gt; caster in the camp.  He died also, I&#39;m really not sure why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This time I grabbed my spare drum to make the run back a little faster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody have any suggestions of how I could have survived the first and<br/>
&gt; last fight, and kept the rest of the party alive also?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep in mind that I&#39;m only level 11 -- so I&#39;m really not interested in<br/>
&gt; hearing about<br/>
&gt; songs that are higher levels(at least until I get there :).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, I had fun, but it was a loosing night for me and experience. </span></blockquote></div>
