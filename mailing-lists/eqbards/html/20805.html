<div id="ygrps-yiv-907315196">My regular group (28 Pally, 29 druid and 28 warrior)<br/>
and I at 32 are hunting the entrance to Infected PAW<br/>
tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the map from eqatlas.com, looks like the<br/>
fabled Kisch drops very far from the entrance but my<br/>
initial contact with the place was very intense and<br/>
enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of action in this place -- looks to me like two<br/>
full groups are needed to keep the entry areas clean<br/>
of spawn...we&#39;ll prolly be here a bit since the xp and<br/>
loot rock.  That said, can anyone give me advice on<br/>
invading the deeper regions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
