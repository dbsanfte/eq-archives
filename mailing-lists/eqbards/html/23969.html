<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075487127">On Xegony, before the xp patch, a /w all bard count would net 30-40.  That&#39;s<br/>
high end, during prime time, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon, around 4pm or so EST, the count was 74.<br/>

I know, I know, hardly scientific or anything, just an observation I&#39;ve<br/>
made.<br/>

<br/>
ok, how many people out of the total subscribers play bards?  by the numbers<br/>
posted here, less than 5%.  by your argument, then bards and their issues<br/>
are <br/>
insignificant because less than 5% of the people who play everquest are<br/>
affected.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s only insignificant if you&#39;re not the one it&#39;s affecting.<br/>
<br/>
