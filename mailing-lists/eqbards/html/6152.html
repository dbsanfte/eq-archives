<div id="ygrps-yiv-907128705">Hatar does spawn in Oasis.  I&#39;ve spent many, many hours in oasis as my monk<br/>
and as my bard and I have never seen Hatar.  I always look at them to see, and<br/>
click on the ones too far away to have text over them...  Never seen him.  I<br/>
would imagine that it&#39;s considerably easier/cheaper to get/buy an<br/>
executioner&#39;s hood.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, cool.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really appreciate all of your comments about my unfortunate human banded<br/>
&gt; &gt; helm situation.  I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with almost<br/>
&gt; &gt; no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  :)<br/>

&gt; Hatar is a spawn so rare, I, and most people I know, have never seen<br/>
&gt; him. He spawns in either Oasis or S Ro (so I&#39;ve heard) and I used to<br/>
&gt; check tracking every time I passed through there. I even auctioned that<br/>
&gt; I would pay 100 plat for a tell from someone when he was sighted and<br/>
&gt; never once got a message. I lucked out and got one from someone who did<br/>
&gt; stumble across him, and I traded a serpantine bracer for it. I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt; run across 3 of them on Tarrew Marr, counting the one I have.<br/>
