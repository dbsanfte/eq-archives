<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791869936">Those are good questions often brought up here Claudio.  Normally I agree<br/>
that binding is fairly easy to acquire, but that is not always the case.  If<br/>
you have ever ventured to Erudin you you will understand my meaning.  I have<br/>
been to Erudin three times now and all three times there were less than 6<br/>
people on the entire continent, none of whom could bind.  I had Erudin all<br/>
to myself and Kerra Isle as well.  It was very depressing.<br/>
<br/>
Also worry not about the English, it sounded better than that spoken by many<br/>
who call it their first language!  What is your first language by the way?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The difference between my story and yours?  I was bound in Kelethin, and<br/>
&gt;heading for Erudin.  Death #1 = the exact same place you died, but Death #2<br/>
&gt;was in Kithicor (thanks, Capt. Shralok!).  That&#39;s when I decided to ask for<br/>
&gt;a teleport.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    That makes me ask something that was in my mind for some time now.<br/>
Why we bards, Traveleurs of Norrah, that should move from city to city,<br/>
telling our stories..<br/>
           Why we don&#39;t have any binding song?? I particulary think it would<br/>
make sense,<br/>
       Even if not bind forever, it could have binded a few days, instead i<br/>
have to buy, &quot;or beg to buy&quot; someone else bind !!!<br/>
