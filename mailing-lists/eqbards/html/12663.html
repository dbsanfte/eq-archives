<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061138547">I think just about every bard out there wish it didn&#39;t take so long to<br/>
memorize new songs.  At 30th level, the low level songs aren&#39;t that big of a<br/>
hassle anymore.  It only takes a few seconds to memorize them.  However, the<br/>
30th level songs seems like it takes forever.  In real life, any good<br/>
musician or singer nkows their music and lyrics like the back of their hand.<br/>
I&#39;ll give you a good example.  I&#39;ve seen Jimmy Buffett in concert at least<br/>
20 times.  He has a segment during his concerts called Stump the Band.  He<br/>
invites fans up to the stage and they get to choose what song the JB and the<br/>
Coral Reefers will play. A lot of people pick obscure songs from his albums<br/>
released back in the 70s and early 80s.  On every occasion, Buffett and the<br/>
band start right up like they had been rehearsing the song for weeks.  Not<br/>
once have I seen the band get stumped.  Bards in EQ should be the same way.<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t matter what level you are or what level the song is you want to<br/>
memorize.  IMO, every song should take the same amount of time to memorize.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest advantage to this would be that it would make it<br/>
feasible to memorize new songs while in combat.  I&#39;ve never played a caster<br/>
class, but I&#39;ve been told they can switch out spells in combat rather<br/>
quickly, assuming they aren&#39;t getting attacked.  I think the biggest<br/>
justification we would have is that all of our songs perform a unique<br/>
function.  Bards are probably the only class that consistently use their<br/>
level 10 and lower songs/spells once they get to the medium/high levels.<br/>
For caster classes, a lot of their higher level spells are just better<br/>
version of lower level spells.  The eight song/spell slots constraint<br/>
doesn&#39;t hamper them as mush as it hampers us.     <br/>
<br/>
If a lot of you out there think it would be a good idea, I would like to<br/>
submit a petition to Verant requesting that they implement this change.  If<br/>
all our songs take the same amount of time to memorize, there wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
any need to give us the meditate skill.  I would like to include some<br/>
quantitative data as part of the petition.  This data would be the required<br/>
time to memorize songs broken down by level.  Don&#39;t think we need to include<br/>
data on all 50 levels but instead accumulate data for all levels in<br/>
increments of five (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20...50).  Since I&#39;m 30th level, I&#39;ll<br/>
get the data for that level.  If we can&#39;t find someone on the list that is<br/>
the appropriate level, guess we could get someone close to that level (i.e.<br/>
no level 10 bards on list so 9 or 11 acceptable).  All you would have to do<br/>
is start at song #1 and time it from start to finish.  Wash, rinse and<br/>
repeat until you get to your highest level song.  Post your results on the<br/>
list.    <br/>
<br/>
Good idea? Waste of time? Better way to gather the data?<br/>
