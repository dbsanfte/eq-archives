<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685306684">Harmonic, official warning for unnecessary flame.  I let the thread roll a <br/>
little because sometimes we all just need to vent once in a while - however <br/>
this shows that we don&#39;t have the maturity to discuss it without turning it <br/>
into a flame war.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>
&gt; &gt; was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>
&gt; &gt; if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>
&gt; &gt; intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Give me a fucking break, don&#39;t ever post shit like that again.<br/>
&gt;   If you have a problem with me address it to me.  I&#39;m growing<br/>
&gt;   very tired of you Verant asskissers.  That clear enough?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Use your power, and press the delete key, because you are the naive<br/>
&gt;   one here buddy.  I for one don&#39;t give a shit about what you think<br/>
&gt;   after that kind of bashing. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   btw, have a nice day.<br/>
