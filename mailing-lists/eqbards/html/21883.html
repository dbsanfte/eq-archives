<br/>
Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>
<br/>
The more i play, the less bards i realize there are. When i do a /who all<br/>
bard in my guild, i count 2 bards at the most, me and a lev 52 (unless<br/>
there&#39;s a hidden one somewhere).  How sad is that? do a /who all warrior or<br/>
any other class in the guild and you&#39;ll see on average 7.  Mind you in a<br/>
weird way this is to my advantage as whenever i&#39;m planes capable, i wont<br/>
have to lotto for imbrued since she&#39;s got a full set, a breath of harmony<br/>
and a partisan.  But still, i still wish there were more bards around but i<br/>
think the numbers will keep dropping as i read this mailing list 8(<br/>
<br/>
P.S. got my ss helm, in a weird way, im kinda happy the effect doesnt work<br/>
for me yet. I cant wait to see myself in imbrued/ss together, i think the<br/>
green and yellow look cool together.<br/>
