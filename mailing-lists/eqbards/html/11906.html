<div id="ygrps-yiv-256415171">i&#39;m not sure where i stand on the whole argument.  maybe each item has its<br/>
own argument.  i would like to say though that as far as the lustrous<br/>
russett, i did have a problem with verant changing the armor back after<br/>
making it warrior only.  compared to the number of people who have a guise<br/>
of the deceiver, the number of people who had lustrous russett and were not<br/>
warriors must be a fraction of a percent.  and i would say after MAYBE the<br/>
2nd day PoF was open at most, everyone there KNEW that lustrous russett was<br/>
meant for warriors only (caps for Harm).  it was just common sense.  every<br/>
other armor drop there was class-specific, and lustrous russett comes from<br/>
Amygdalan &quot;Warriors.&quot;  anyone that had lustrous russett pretty much knew<br/>
that they were going to lose it.  and no one was let into lustrous russett<br/>
lottos except warriors.  in the whole time since PoF opened i think i have<br/>
seen exactly 2 people who were not warriors and had lustrous russett.  they<br/>
were both bards, and they both figured they were going to lose it.  now with<br/>
the guise, there are hundreds and hundreds of people with them, so it is<br/>
quite a larger impact to remove them.  not sure of the non-warrior russett<br/>
situation on other servers, i guess i am just assuming it is about the same.<br/>
like most things, it does not affect me, just my thoughts on the subject.<br/>
and since i would think russett should have stayed changed, though the mask<br/>
should not (just because of the much larger impact) maybe each item needs to<br/>
be looked at individually.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; There is a precedent for this.  The original warrior armor<br/>
&gt; from PoF was mislabeled so that a variety of classes<br/>
&gt; (including bards) could use it.  Being warrior armor, the<br/>
&gt; stats were way better than anything available to those<br/>
&gt; classes.  They fixed it so only warriors could equip it, there<br/>
&gt; was a huge outcry, they changed it back, and created some new<br/>
&gt; warrior armor. </span></blockquote></div>
