<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450971269">Sorry, guess I should clarify.  The boots are decent if you don&#39;t have<br/>
planar.<br/>
Compare them to imbrued though.  18ac, no stats vs. 16ac, 5str, 9sta, 10CR.<br/>
Which would you wear?<br/>

Uhh forgive my ignorance...<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you wear them?  They&#39;re AC 18!?!?  I wear mine now, even with<br/>
the silly 1 water proc.  My lambent boots are far lower in AC than the<br/>
singing steel... can you explain why you wouldn&#39;t wear the steel?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>

&gt; Even if the boots summoned 20 water at once like the level 24 mage spell,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d find them more useful.  Mind you, they&#39;d still stay in my backpack and<br/>
&gt; only come out when I&#39;m thirsty.<br/>
&gt; I just cant be bothered to click on the damn things 20 times to get a<br/>
usable<br/>
&gt; amount of water.  I don&#39;t know any caster that bothers to use their single<br/>
&gt; food/drink summoning spells, its just too much trouble.  Its not exactly<br/>
&gt; hard or expensive to buy a large supply of food/drink and carry it with<br/>
you.<br/>
