<div id="ygrps-yiv-188270825">Ok I wanted to see what my AoE song&#39;s damages were tonite so I dueled a friend of mine.  I had seen other people document what their&#39;s did so I was going to see for myself.  Well we did the typical /duel to each other and my songs had no effect.  No messages or anything.  They just made the pretty lights when I first started them and then nothing.  I did a bellow and he took damage.  What am I missing?  He is a level 28 by the way, but I dont see what the level difference would have to do with it, besides him kicking my butt.  8)<br/>
