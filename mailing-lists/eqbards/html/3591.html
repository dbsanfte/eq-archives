<div id="ygrps-yiv-312303546">I find that the ability to solo Blues or whites depends entirely on the <br/>
monster.  Some blues are easy (beetles, lions, orcs) while others are almost <br/>
sure death (aviaks, most spellcasters, undead reavers)  The classic example of <br/>
this is bandits.  A blue fighter type bandit was easy pickings but a blue spell <br/>
caster bandit was death.  I usually learn this the hard way...  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think this is a matter of playing style, as well as character race and<br/>
&gt; strength.  I have been unable to solo without dying every five minutes since <br/>
&gt; level 12 or so.  Mainly because I am a wood elf and most of the things that <br/>
&gt; are blue to my character have a nasty habit of hitting hard and stunning<br/>
&gt; often, as well as gathering friends to help them. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Playing style, yes. Character race, no. I too am a wood elf and I am still <br/>
soloing effectively at level 16. At this time I can take on 2 risky&#39;s or 1 <br/>
dangerous enemy and come out with at least 2 bubbles of healt left. And when I <br/>
hit 17 and get dual wield I feel that will give me the extra boost to be able to<br/>
solo into the low 20&#39;s or so.<br/>
     <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I group with friends whenever they are around, but our <br/>
schedules don&#39;t always mesh so I&#39;ve learned how to solo too.<br/>
