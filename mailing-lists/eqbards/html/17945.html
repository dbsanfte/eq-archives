<b>Subject:</b> Charming Equipment Advice <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154615140">I have just hit the magical level 27 over the weekend. I have talked to many people in game that say<br/>
I won&#39;t get much benefit from more Charisma over my 123 I have now.<br/>
<br/>
Now the question I have is this true? If so can you advise some equipment for me to get to raise my<br/>
charisma up some? Also should I use a Mino Horn or just hold my crude stein?<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern is not losing to much strength. I have a 107 now.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I have:<br/>
<br/>
Chest: Bronze Breast<br/>
Face: Mask of Deception<br/>
Rings Jagged Bands (2)<br/>
Ears: Opalline Earrings (2)<br/>
Hands: Elf Hide Gloves<br/>
Head: Skull Shaped Barbrute<br/>
Shoulders: Blood Stained Mantle<br/>
Neck: Cape of the Midnight Mist<br/>
Legs: Shin Greaves<br/>
Feet: Banded Boots<br/>
Wrists: Bronze Bracer<br/>
Wrists: Bracer of Erollisi<br/>
Arms: Barbed Armplates<br/>
Waist: Troll Hide Belt<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
