<div id="ygrps-yiv-341694165">Now wait a minute.  How in the world is a discussion of which weapons <br/>
     are good for bards off topic???  Lets not get carried away here.  True <br/>
     the twinking/lottery thread was way OT but lets not let that scare us <br/>
     off of talking about stuff that is useful to all of us, especially <br/>
     those of us under 20 who rely on this list for advice to avoid making <br/>
     painful errors.  If I hadn&#39;t joined this list I might still be singing <br/>
     one song at a time...  )  <br/>
     <br/>
     For example I asked if Bronze Armor stopped more damage then banded <br/>
     over and above the AC increase. (which is very modest compared to its <br/>
     weight.)  Not one answer.  This is a relevant Bard topic because we <br/>
     can&#39;t afford to put all our extra points into Strength and the <br/>
     decision to wear Bronze plate is a tough one.  Any thoughts?<br/>
     <br/>
     Ok no more messages today,  I promise.<br/>

Actually the Dirk is better then a Well Balanced Rapier as well.  The WB <br/>
Rapier is 6 dam 23 delay, but no stat bonuses and wieghs over twice as much. <br/>
  Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  The Dirk, IMO, is the most <br/>
unbalanced weapon in the game.  But that said they can have mine when they <br/>
pry it from my cold, dead fingers &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

&gt;Off topic just for your benefit.  Actually it is not that much off topic <br/>
&gt;since the bad is a rogue-type class and notorious for using dagger and <br/>
&gt;piercing weapons  (thats why bards have some thieving abilites).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Combine Longsword:  Damage 6,  28 delay,  hits magical creatures <br/>
&gt;Dragoon Dirk:  Damage 6,  23 delay, +2 dexterity, +3 magic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hands down Dirk is way better.<br/>
