&gt;Well, the new Paw was intended for &quot;mid&quot; level players but Verant never <br/>
&gt;tells us what range they consider mid. I hear that deeper in there are <br/>
&gt;gnolls blue to L45+ players but I have yet to make it in that far. To get <br/>
&gt;there requires you to make your way through a ton of green casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s certainly a more time consuming job than making it to the champ room <br/>
&gt;of sol b, or the frenzied or lord room in lguk, even when those dungeons <br/>
&gt;are empty, and definately something that would be very difficult for a <br/>
&gt;pickup group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had some very interesting experiences in Paw this week, and can safely say <br/>
it is a very exciting place and provided me with hours of adrenaline-pulsing <br/>
thrills.<br/>
<br/>
I never visited the old Paw, back when those wimpy Splitpaw gnolls were <br/>
around, so when I entered a few days ago for the first time I was quite <br/>
apprehensive.  I was accompanied by some guildmates, including a 50th level <br/>
druid and a 47th level ranger, with whom I have been in far worse places (in <br/>
fact, we had just come from Lower Guk).<br/>
<br/>
When we entered we ran into a group of old friends (well, I knew only a few <br/>
of them, but my groupmates knew them all).  The 9 of us (I think the <br/>
youngest was 32 or so) headed in as one band, and cleared the way as we <br/>
went.  Each group had an evacer (druid for us, wiz for the others) and a <br/>
bard to keep everyone functioning to their fullest capacity.  Well, long <br/>
story short, we got to the home of the Ishva (mommy gnoll, around 40th <br/>
level), and in a HUGE battle that lasted 8 minutes, we almost killed her, <br/>
she healed herself fully (grrrrr), and we got her back down to 1/16th life <br/>
before every one of us died (I was second to last to fall, the other bard <br/>
was last).  We were so close nobody wanted to evac... though we all died, we <br/>
had a blast, and we&#39;ve vowed to get our revenge on that &lt;ahem&gt; bitch (pardon <br/>
the zoological term).<br/>
<br/>
The nonunique gnolls down there go at least as high as 35th level, from what <br/>
I have seen, and there are 2 unique gnolls I have found so far: Ishva and <br/>
the named gnoll &quot;Boss&quot; after whom one of the tribes is named.   His name <br/>
escapes me, but we were disappointed to find he had no loot at all.  Ishva <br/>
is FAR tougher, be warned.<br/>
<br/>
Try it out - the new Paw is a very exciting place to hunt, and almost every <br/>
puppy drops a few plat and FS, so the money and experience are good.  It is <br/>
also very underhunted as of yet, and from what I have seen every gnoll there <br/>
has a chance of dropping nice stuff (Splitpaw aromr, weapons, misc magic <br/>
items, etc).  Very very few gnolls see invisible, and we made several corpse <br/>
recoveries with no trouble, so if you have someone to evac you can slip past <br/>
the entryway and head right down to the big fights.<br/>
