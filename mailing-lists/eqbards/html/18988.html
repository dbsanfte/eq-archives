<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418049952">I have been experiencing quite a bit of &#39;hate list&#39; wierdness in Kunark.<br/>
Were you guys charming anything?  We noticed in Frontier that if our<br/>
enchanter charmed a giant, he got added to the hate list of several if not<br/>
all the giants in the castle.  When my song pulsed on him, even from halfway<br/>
across the zone, if I went within chase range the giants in the castle would<br/>
agro on me even though I had never been anywhere near them before.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely sounds like a bug to me and we got a gm to come witness it and<br/>
make a report.<br/>

Forgot to answer this. Our guild has been down to right outside Trak&#39;s<br/>
lair. Those shrooms guard the caves down there, along with Sebilite<br/>
Protectors and some very high level frogs. There&#39;s no way in hell they<br/>
should be agroing up by the bridge area.<br/>

if you jump off the first bridge you hit on the way in and swim down to<br/>
the end of the right side water area, you can swim down a tunnel that<br/>
takes you to a jail filled with high level frogs. There&#39;s a passage down<br/>
there that will take you into the cave area and on to Trak&#39;s lair. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t advise trying this without a high level multi group party, and<br/>
we haven&#39;t done it since the patch so it may be even harder with the<br/>
random mob warping we are seeing now.<br/>
