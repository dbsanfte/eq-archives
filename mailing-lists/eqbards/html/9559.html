<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257349621">I like this idea.  For instance if you want to get a GZ (btw the GZ needs to<br/>
be moved off of Kharg..virtually impossible for lower levels to get a Polar<br/>
Cloak from him..as soon as he spawns he gets the $h*! clobbered out of him<br/>
for the GZ) make the PC have to turn in 2 Langseax and some other quest<br/>
items...or whatever scenario you dream up.<br/>

&gt; This is a problem whenever you have a closed ecomony - stuff comes in -<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; never goes out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Decay is a pain in the butt - trust me - you DON&#39;T want your stuff<br/>
damaged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The solution is to make items components of other items. This is already<br/>
&gt; done in rare cases - like to get the screaming mace. It&#39;s voluntary that<br/>
way. </span></blockquote></div>
