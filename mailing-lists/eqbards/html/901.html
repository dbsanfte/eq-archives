it was normal.  Ever since I got bellow, I can only think of a<br/>
handful of times it&#39;s been resisted by a yellow.  A lot of<br/>
times I can use it on reds as well, though high reds (stuff<br/>
that singlehandedly nearly wipes out my party) usually resist<br/>
it, but I still get a fair number in.  Interestingly, those I<br/>
do get in are often near the low end of the damage range,<br/>
which supports the guy&#39;s claim that resist and damage are<br/>
linked.  Last night I was flabbergasted because a green wisp<br/>
resisted bellow three times.  That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had a<br/>
green resist it, and suspect Verant cranked up their magic<br/>
resist to make it harder to farm them.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the other way to test is to go fight a skunk and get<br/>
that nasty -30 chr, and try things then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Missing notes when you start a song seems to be tied more to<br/>
instrument skill.  When you first get a new skill, you will<br/>
miss notes a lot.  I *think* dex is tied into how well you can<br/>
hold a song when you&#39;re hit.  I have to restart my song every<br/>
3-4 hits fighting blue-yellow mobs (stuns excepted) at 90 dex.<br/>
