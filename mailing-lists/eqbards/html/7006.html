<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051351030"><blockquote><span title="qreply">&gt; I&#39;ve said this, too.  Someone recently asked me why there are no<br/>
&gt; Bard-quests for Bard instruments (aside from Sylias &quot;Drum&quot; quest).  Didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a good answer.  Sad, too.  We really should.  Perhaps assembling the<br/>
&gt; parts of a magic Lute or something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which begs the question, what are all those unfinished horna and lute strings<br/>
&gt; for?  They sell them in Feerrott even (and how many orge bards have you<br/>
&gt; seen?).  If they are not part of a quest, are they for sale just to look like<br/>
&gt; real instruments, so silly bards will waste money buying the wrong item?  Use<br/>
&gt; them or get rid of them. </span></blockquote></div>
