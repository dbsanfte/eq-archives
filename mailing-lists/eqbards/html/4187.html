<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973911347">I&#39;ve found a lot of different types of meat on Lockjaw after killing him.<br/>
Sometimes he has no meat, sometimes he has 3 or 4 different kinds.  Gnome,<br/>
Dwarf, High elf, Dark elf, etc.  I&#39;ve always wondered if the type of meat<br/>
you find has anything to do with other players that he&#39;s eaten as he<br/>
rampaged throughout the zone.<br/>

&gt;     I was fighting spiders in E. Karana a while back and got &#39;Halfling<br/>
&gt;     parts&quot; as loot. (eeuuww) Twice.  Quite a shock.  I think it was salted<br/>
&gt;     by someone with a wicked sense of humor but I&#39;m not 100 percent sure.<br/>
&gt;     It is conceivable that a giant spider would have Halfling parts<br/>
&gt;     (Samwise, where is Frodo anyway...) but I haven&#39;t seen this extreme<br/>
&gt;     level of humor before from variant.  Anyone else have a similar<br/>
&gt;     experience?<br/>

a grisly sense of humor<br/>
