<div id="ygrps-yiv-515924822">I wouldn&#39;t say that Motion is totally useless. Saturday Night in Runnyeye a<br/>
group member got stuck in some boards near water. I memorized motion and<br/>
blinked him out. COurse I blinked myself right into the boards but that&#39;s<br/>
besides the point. Fortunately the group member was also a bard so he<br/>
memorized it and blinked me underneath into the water. I then equipped my<br/>
flute and blinked out down the passage.<br/>
	Sure we could have used a succor/evac, but we didn&#39;t want to waste the time<br/>
travelling all the way back.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)The level 14 song DOES have a purpose.  With many lore items,<br/>
8)and even a few<br/>
8)non-lore items you receive a message about the item.  For<br/>
8)instance, one ogre<br/>
8)I happened upon once mentioned someone had given him a human<br/>
8)head as a gift,<br/>
8)and he wished to know whose it was.  With that song I was<br/>
8)able to tell him<br/>
8)the name of the disgusting little pet head he carried around<br/>
8)with him.  The<br/>
8)song is often useful for getting clues with quest items.  I<br/>
8)once found a key<br/>
8)and used the song to tell me it was a High Hold Strongbox<br/>
8)key.  Many of the<br/>
8)messages you get from items using this song have not been<br/>
8)implemented yet<br/>
8)(that&#39;s what pending lore means!).  Bards get a song to learn the lore<br/>
8)behind the item, and though the lore might often be<br/>
8)pointless, of course<br/>
8)bards should know it!  So the song is good.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Regardless, I use this song more often that Mellifluous<br/>
8)Motion!  Now THERE&#39;s<br/>
8)a song I see no purpose for!  It seems to function like the<br/>
8)old D&D spell<br/>
8)Blink, but for it to be useful at all I think it would need its pulses<br/>
8)shortened.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a joke-song, and often a<br/>
8)cruel joke at that.<br/>

8)The level 14<br/>
8)Lore song needs to have a purpose or needs to be replaced<br/>
8)period.  We simply<br/>
8)do not have enough going for us to make pointless songs<br/>
8)acceptable.  These<br/>
