<b>Subject:</b> Mask of Deception and Ultravision <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172220510">I posted earlier that I wasn&#39;t gaining ultravision when I activated the DE<br/>
illusion from the Mask of Deception.  Someone followed up that the<br/>
ultravision from the Mask worked fine for them.  Would like to hear from<br/>
other people who have a Mask of Deception to see if they get ultravision<br/>
when activating the illusion.  Specifically need to know what race you are.<br/>
Its possible that the ultravision works for humans (who only have normal<br/>
vision) but may possibly be broken for wood elves and/or half-elves (who<br/>
have infravision).  BTW my bard is a wood elf.<br/>
<br/>
This request doesn&#39;t apply to people who have the Guise of the Deceiver.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
