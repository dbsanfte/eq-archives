<div id="ygrps-yiv-713867163">I&#39;m an actor, but like most of them you&#39;ve probably never seen me, being<br/>
just stage in Chicago.  Hate singing, but I can fake it.  Bards were just as<br/>
much actors anyway, eh?  Actually the keepers of history.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what sort of bothers me about the more, shall we say, rustic races:<br/>
they have no bards.  This, to me, makes little sense, with no scholars you<br/>
think the trolls and ogres would at least have a bardic equivalent, perhaps<br/>
only using drums.  Tribal cultures always have bards!  In fact, once the<br/>
scholars start writing histories the bard loses its importance, and becomes<br/>
just an entertainer.  In a tribal culture a bard is much more important.<br/>
Like a troll can have a shaman, I do think a troll should have some sort of<br/>
bard.<br/>
<br/>
Roop was first created with Wizardry Proving Grounds.  No bards in that<br/>
game, but he changed classes a lot, became quite a jack of all trades!  Took<br/>
him to D&D, then I remember fondly A Bard&#39;s Tale, ah yes.  Having to run up<br/>
to town to get Roop drunk so he could continue his songs, a great game for<br/>
its time.  I sort of rollplay Roop the same way here, only he keeps a<br/>
plentiful supply of mead rather than water in his backpack, heheh.  And my<br/>
character description isn&#39;t a lengthy bio, but just a description: &quot;This elf<br/>
has bloodshot eyes and smells faintly of fishwine.&quot;<br/>
