&gt;Why should this matter to us?  Well if IDIOTS fill the petition queue with<br/>
&gt;RETARDED petitions, it takes the GMs longer to handle real petitions.  How<br/>
&gt;would everyone on Innoruuk feel if their petitions took 30 minutes longer to<br/>
&gt;handle because some IDIOTS felt they could get the database changed by<br/>
&gt;filling up the petition queue?<br/>

&gt;I understand your frustrations, but don&#39;t frustrate everyone else with your<br/>
&gt;actions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I understand yours, however, I have noticed a recent increase in <br/>
&quot;borderline&quot; comments.  By borderline, I&#39;m saying things that you may not <br/>
conciously have intended as inflammatory, but are.  This, in turn, sets off <br/>
someone&#39;s flame-mode, and well, you all know where it goes from there.<br/>
I&#39;m not to concerned about the list degenerating into chaos, but I do like <br/>
to see us getting along and discussing things rationally, so I will request <br/>
this:  Please be careful what you say, and try not to call someone an <br/>
idiot.  Even if you know for a fact that they are 100% certifiably stupid. <br/>
;)  And while this is (unfortunately) directed at Wayne (you were well <br/>
timed), it also applies to some other members of our list.  Remember, you <br/>
get more flies with honey, etc. etc.<br/>
And just because some of you actually read my messages, here is today&#39;s <br/>
secret: Get your rubicite armour while you still can.<br/>
