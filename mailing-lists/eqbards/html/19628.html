 </span></blockquote>Actually, there is a .0976562% chance of going 10 red or 10 black in <br/>
a row.  I&#39;d have to disagree that 10 in a row is &quot;hardly uncommon&quot;.  <br/>
It _can_ happen and _does_ happen, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s very rare.  In <br/>
fact, unless they&#39;re fixed tables, I&#39;m sure it only happens about 1 <br/>
out of every 1,000 rolls.  And THAT is when there&#39;s a 50/50 chance.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take a look at the chances of 5 rare mobs (5% spawn rate) <br/>
spawning in a row:<br/>
<br/>
The calculation is:<br/>
<br/>
100%/20 /20 /20 /20 /20 = .0000312% chance.  <br/>
<br/>
Five 5% spawns should almost never spawn in a row.  Of course, there <br/>
is the small chance they will.  And, of course, that small chance is <br/>
why casino&#39;s make mega-bucks.<br/>
