&gt;Perhaps the moderator of this list can send an email to Verant and request<br/>
&gt;that the bard programmer join this list.  Include in the message that we as<br/>
&gt;representatives of the EQ bard community are requesting this not so much as<br/>
&gt;a way for us to get detailed explanations of game mechanics but instead as a<br/>
&gt;way to get official confirmation on theories that we have tested and believe<br/>
&gt;to be true.  For example, if someone has a theory on how a song works, the<br/>
&gt;bard programmer could confirm if he was right or not.  If the response is<br/>
&gt;that the theory is wrong, thats all he has to say.  It would be up to us to<br/>
&gt;figure it out from there.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may be wishful thinking on my part but its worth a shot.  If the<br/>
&gt;moderator doesn&#39;t want to write the letter, I can do it.  Either way I think<br/>
&gt;the message should be posted here first for us to agree it is worded good<br/>
&gt;enough to at least get a yes/no response.<br/>
<br/>
