&gt; Elwyn: Where, oh where are our missings songs?!  Several of our songs<br/>
&gt; (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the game.  We would like to know<br/>
&gt; when we can expect these to be implemented.  If they are indeed in the game<br/>
&gt; already perhaps discovered via quests) please at least let us know that they<br/>
&gt; exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to get them, or even what they are,<br/>
&gt; but we don&#39;t want to waste our time questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve been without these songs (whatever they are) since day one of release,<br/>
&gt; and its become a point of serious aggravation for us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>
&gt; break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to be able to<br/>
&gt; add new abilities to Bards as the game contintued.<br/>
&gt; lol.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really have to take issue with this. It is an expansion pack. For levels<br/>
&gt; OVER 50. Sure i may never even get to those levels..BUT they should be in<br/>
&gt; game now. Whats gonna happen when the expansion pack comes out? We dont get<br/>
&gt; any new songs for over 50 cause they filled in our missing songs from below<br/>
&gt; 50? *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what&#39;s really annoying about this is that if you read between<br/>
the lines, you can pretty well see that you won&#39;t be seeing a song per<br/>
level after 50 when the expansion comes out either. I have a feeling<br/>
that they just ran out of ideas for songs<br/>
