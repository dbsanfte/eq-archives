Woo, barely doused the flames there.  I am SO, very, very, very sick of<br/>
seeing patch messages that quietly proclaim that something is now in which<br/>
we have been assured 100 times is in on live servers.  Absor and Abashi both<br/>
have continually maintained that the wizard teleports have been on the live<br/>
servers.  To quote Absor, &quot;the vendor is there and I am surprised you<br/>
haven&#39;t found it, it doesn&#39;t have to be blatantly obvious&quot;.  When will they<br/>
ever get a clue that if 250,000+ people cannot find an item on a vendor it<br/>
is 99% likely to NOT be there?  It would have taken someone at VI all of 5<br/>
minutes to log onto a live server, guide tp to the vendors loc and check<br/>
this out, yet it took two weeks of &quot;it&#39;s in there&quot; and two weeks of &quot;you&#39;re<br/>
wrong Absor&quot; to get it worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Heck the port to the plane of mischief was probably only visible to gnome<br/>
clerics and paladins of Bristlebane before this.<br/>

Very boring stuff this time.  I guess good for Velious travel, but other<br/>
than that.  Well, expect to suddenly see another glowing spinning ball<br/>
signifying the minor polishing of the Plane of Mischief (read, oh hell we<br/>
forgot to put the port in)  &quot;that&#39;s been there all along.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Small Patch*<br/>
<br/>
These include some minor<br/>
polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard&#39;s<br/>
Velious teleport spells on merchants.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, we&#39;ll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.<br/>
We&#39;ll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br/>
