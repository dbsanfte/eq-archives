<div id="ygrps-yiv-73150979">Hello,<br/>
You mention that most folks don&#39;t know what bards are<br/>
capable of.  TELL US ABOUT IT! hehe.  I think this is<br/>
the case on ALL servers.  Most times I join a group,<br/>
folks regard me as a third rate tank.  When I leave<br/>
it, they KNOW what a bard can do (for some reason Im<br/>
finding it easy to twist 3 songs still).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, its SOOOO frustrating when someone who<br/>
THINKS he knows what a bard can do starts TELLING you<br/>
what to sing.  The other night, I was grouped with a<br/>
cleric in my guild in Beholder.  He was level 18 and I<br/>
was hoping to grab some Minos to get him some fast exp<br/>
(IM only level 20, but in Beholder, that means most<br/>
Gorge Minos are green and Chasm&#39;s are blue).  We met a<br/>
Druid of level 19 there who wanted to join us, as he<br/>
was getting slaughtered solo.  We added him and I<br/>
contnued to pull.  One pull I got 3 Gorge minos<br/>
following me.  Knowing my skills, I donned my horn and<br/>
twisted Chords, DDD, and Largo&#39;s.  I decided that AoE<br/>
songs would do more to them than me with weapons.  <br/>
<br/>
Well...the Druid starts shouting at me to get my<br/>
weapons back on and fight (as he is standing back and<br/>
casting) and to turn on the Heal song.  Nobody was<br/>
below 4 full bubbles of health, and the Mino&#39;s were<br/>
dropping fast, so I ignored him till after the battle.<br/>
 When it was done, I explained why I did what I did,<br/>
but he didnt seem to understand.  He had the typical<br/>
&quot;Bards should fight and sing HEAL&quot; attitude found at<br/>
around level 20 by folks who don&#39;t know bards.  Of<br/>
course, he burned ALL his mana every fight, so I<br/>
didn&#39;t consider him to understand HIS OWN class for<br/>
that matter.  After this repeated, I sent some tells<br/>
my cleric friend and we decided to tell the druid to<br/>
find another group.  I hated to send someone away, but<br/>
I REFUSE to be told how to play my OWN class.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else get this sort of thing happen to them?<br/>
