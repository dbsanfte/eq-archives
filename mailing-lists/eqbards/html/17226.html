 </span></blockquote>Other than the four skills that you mentioned (Dual Wield, Double Attack, Kick, Bash), there are a large<br/>
number of other factors that affect melee damage that Bards do not get:  STR-based damage increase,<br/>
critical hits, that new thingie that Warriors get (crippling damage?), Monk special attacks, Backstabs.<br/>
The fact that we get Dual Wield and that other hybrids get Dual Wield/Double Attack (plus Kick, Bash,<br/>
Slam, whatever) means that they ALL do significantly more damage than we do.  And don&#39;t even begin to talk<br/>
about the three pure melee classes.<br/>
<br/>
I logged some fights between level 43 and 45 just to get a feel for things, and I estimated that Bards do<br/>
about 50% of the melee damage that other hybrids do, and about 25% of the melee damage of the three pure<br/>
melee characters.  That was including my dual Ykesha procs.  Btw, using &quot;similar weapons&quot; is not really a<br/>
good measure; weapon selection is part of the ability to do damage, and the fact that weapons are<br/>
class-limited gives advantages to classes with good class-specific weapons.  Oh yeah, Bards don&#39;t GET<br/>
any...  The amount that a Bard contributes to melee shrinks drastically as he and his groupmates go up in<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
If high-level Bards had magic that made them roughly 75% as powerful as pure caster classes, I might not<br/>
mind.  I&#39;m not convinced that they do.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem is Verant&#39;s extreme paranoia regarding our &quot;manaless&quot; casting.  But our casting is<br/>
only &quot;manaless&quot; because of the way they chose to write their code.  In reality, you can think of Bard<br/>
&quot;mana&quot; use this way:<br/>
<br/>
1.  A standing caster can regen X mana per second.<br/>
2.  A Bard song takes 3 seconds to cast ==&gt; they cost 3X mana to cast.<br/>
3.  A song lasts 9 seconds.  If it can be twisted, it costs X/3 mana per second of effect.  If it cannot<br/>
be twisted (Lullaby, for instance), it cost X mana per second.<br/>
<br/>
Since X is pretty low (mana regen for standing casters), even this analysis looks like a great deal, but<br/>
there are two other considerations:<br/>
<br/>
1.  We can&#39;t &quot;bank&quot; mana, e.g. we cannot burn mana any faster than this, unlike all other classes who can<br/>
buff between fights and still enter a fight with full mana.<br/>
2.  Casting classes get Meditate, which, as they level up, permits them to regain Mana at ever-increasing<br/>
rates.  So for casters, X increases vastly with level, while it does not increase at all for us.  X limits<br/>
casters during a long combat, but it is not their average limit.<br/>
<br/>
The result is that our higher-level songs just aren&#39;t strong enough to measure up.  Some of our low-level<br/>
songs are very powerful relative to the level, which makes Bards quite good at an early age.  But at level<br/>
47, none of my current song lists includes more than 2 of the last 10 songs I&#39;ve received.  That&#39;s pretty<br/>
pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are a lot of clever things we can do with our songs, I&#39;ve even figured one or two of<br/>
them out myself (the rest I got from here!), and I still have fun playing.  But to those of you who will<br/>
write back telling me that Bards are just fine, I can only say:  there are always people who will take<br/>
great pleasure and pride in building a piano from scratch using a nail file, a penknife and a big rock.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that it wouldn&#39;t be nicer to have adequate tools.  Bards get weaker with age.<br/>

PS - Given that Verant&#39;s design intent re: Bards was to make a class that significantly augmented groups,<br/>
and that they balance this by making them weak soloers, one would like to think that Bards would be one of<br/>
the first classes that a large (4-6) group would look for.  We&#39;re way down on any list that I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
What does that tell you?</div>
