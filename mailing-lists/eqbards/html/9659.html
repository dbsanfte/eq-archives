Bah!! I&#39;ve run thru at night SEVERAL times and have had NO problem<br/>
whatsoever. Didn&#39;t even see anything to sneeze at and I&#39;m only a L19 bard.<br/>
Maybe it depends HOW you run thru? I usually take the wall/zone edge that<br/>
goes directly left coming out of HH, where you pass Rivervale zonepoint and<br/>
can get to WC zonepoint in a jiffy... Maybe that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t see<br/>
anything?? Does anyone have any specific &quot;Norrath TIME&quot; on when those<br/>
baddies spawn besides just saying &quot;nighttime&quot; ??<br/>
