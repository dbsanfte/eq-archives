<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347247749">This happened to me before aswell. My friend died in Lava and I used locate<br/>
corpse, it pointed me in the direction of the Lavafall (which I didn&#39;t know<br/>
was there at the time. I got a Levitate (so did he) and went in, went over<br/>
the lava fall and tried to locate the corpse, nothing......<br/>
<br/>
I ended up going in to Sol B, I shit myself (I was level 27) and zoned<br/>
back, tried to go back the way I came and couldn&#39;t get up the lava fall, I<br/>
was really shitting it now, went back and had to go the Sol B way. So I<br/>
zoned in and after burning my ass numerous times I was left with just over<br/>
1 bub health. From the top of the lava there was a large cavernous area and<br/>
in the middle on a raised island was a platform with people on, I floated<br/>
across and landed with a group of 6 level 45&#39;s+ they healed me up and<br/>
showed me the way out. I was soooo relieved when I was out of there.<br/>
<br/>
My friend ended up getting a GM to get his corpse for him.<br/>

    The sequence of events for me - I fell in lava right near the entrance<br/>
(from Lavastorm).  Given the number of hit points a 29 bard has - and the<br/>
lava doing damage in 56 increments - I realized I had a good amount of<br/>
time - and tried to climb out.<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t realize this wasn&#39;t possible - and got myself in deep (nice<br/>
pun<br/>
there &lt;g&gt;).  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; (waterfall type thingy) that you can&#39;t<br/>
climb out.  Right past there is a zone to Sol-B.<br/>
<br/>
    My situation was that my Druid helper died because our levitations wore<br/>
off.  Being the selfless type - he renewed mine before his - and<br/>
subsequently died when his fizzled.  I figured I could &quot;safely&quot; zone to B<br/>
because I had a freshly renewed Levitate and would have plenty of time to<br/>
zone back if I had no better luck getting our of the lava in B.<br/>
<br/>
    When I got to B - I can&#39;t remember exactly the layout (first time I was<br/>
there anyhow) but there&#39;s like a big cavernous area - so with levitate it<br/>
was pretty easy to get to solid ground.<br/>
<br/>
    As far as your question - the zone from Sol-B to Sol-A is already lava<br/>
-<br/>
so you&#39;d already have to have fell into lava in Sol-B to zone through Lava<br/>
to Sol-A...<br/>

&gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into<br/>
Sol-b?<br/>
&gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in<br/>
Lava<br/>
&gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone out of<br/>
sol-b<br/>
&gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>
