&gt;for insane amounts of damage.  stepping away may help, but i see mobs<br/>

&gt;see mobs that no one else has even aggro&#39;d turn off me when i pulse it.<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s a nice song that works well and i find a lot of use out of it.  now if<br/>
&gt;i feel the need for something more important, i&#39;ll got with it.  Song of<br/>
&gt;Dawn is in one of my often-changed song slots, but i do have it memmed a<br/>
&gt;lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>definitely that large difference in the way we play is going to result in a large<br/>
difference of our views on the class.  for example while most of us consider<br/>
charm a staple song, you probably don&#39;t even have it memmed most of the<br/>
time, right?  actually it would be kind of interesting to see what your &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39;<br/>
song list does contain, if you don&#39;t mind giving out that info, heh.<br/>
