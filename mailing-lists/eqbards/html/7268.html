I have not tested it, but I assume you get (level at which the skill <br/>
appeared on the trainer&#39;s list) + 1 skill points, which translates to <br/>
awful or some such (don&#39;t remember the category names, but suffice it to <br/>
say, you stink at it.  hehe)<br/>

&gt; &gt;The languages are at the bottom of the skill list; new ones appear as you<br/>
&gt; &gt;level up.  You need to invest one point in a language to have it show up<br/>
&gt; &gt;on your skill list.<br/>

&gt; Hey, a very informative email, thank you. :) Quick question though - if you<br/>
&gt; train at your GM for one point only, does that make you excellent?<br/>
