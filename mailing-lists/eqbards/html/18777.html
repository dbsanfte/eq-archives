I haven&#39;t gotten the BoFL yet but I am wanting one, it will be primary hand<br/>
so that it gets the dex bonus for procs.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of bunuses:<br/>
<br/>
The strength and dex bonus are not applied to your offhand.  HOWEVER the<br/>
LEVEL based Damage bonus is.<br/>
<br/>
Level based bonus seems to be (Bonus=(level-25))<br/>
I&#39;ve heard level-20 but haven&#39;t seen results to back that up yet.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I can hit for up to 22dmg with my Bladed Thulian Claws and have<br/>
