<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967084876">I think there is an inherent Catch-22 when playing a bard in a bad group.<br/>
First off, you don&#39;t really know if you are in a bad group until you get a<br/>
bad pull.  Any group, good or bad, can handle the easy pulls.  So you get a<br/>
bad pull.  If you know how to play a bard properly and you are in a bad<br/>
group, you chances of dying increase because you will draw too much<br/>
attention.  The other option is to not play your bard to his maximum<br/>
capability until you gauge the quality of the group.  So you get a bad pull.<br/>
If you played your bard to his maximum capability, there is a chance your<br/>
entire party can survive the fight.  But you don&#39;t want to die so you play<br/>
it safe and not sing the songs you know will draw everything to your<br/>
attention.  Now you risk pissing the other people in your party off because<br/>
you weren&#39;t giving 100% effort in the fight.  Either way you end getting the<br/>
short end of the stick.  For me personally, I always play my bard to the<br/>
best of his capabilities. Therefore, the only way to avoid the situation is<br/>
to play in a regular group or not let it bother you when you die.  Since my<br/>
time constraint wont allow me to play with a regular group, I have just<br/>
accepted the other option as the norm.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

&gt; been in so many bad groups lately that hasn&#39;t translated into playing as<br/>
&gt; much EQ as I used to.  I think that&#39;s the biggest drawback to the bard<br/>
&gt; class.  When you get in a bad group, its the bard that pays the price.  At<br/>
&gt; least that&#39;s been my experience.<br/>
