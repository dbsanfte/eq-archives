 </span></blockquote>Oh I completely agree, most of what he says is spot on.  But<br/>
this was just plain wrong.  :-)  He was considering only one<br/>
attribute (weapon speed) when slecting the best weapon to have<br/>
in your second hand.  While I agree speed is of overriding<br/>
importance if you&#39;re trying to rapidly increase the dual wield<br/>
skill, once you have it maxed it&#39;s damage rate you want to<br/>
maximize.  Damage rate is determined by speed *and* damage, so<br/>
the rule of &quot;fastest weapon&quot; does not apply any more.<br/>
