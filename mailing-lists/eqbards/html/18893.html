<div id="ygrps-yiv-624064221">Found this on Casters Realm...<br/>
<br/>
Baelish: Since Enchanters are beat on more than any other class in <br/>
the game. Could the stats on insidious armor be looked at give higher <br/>
ac / hitpoints? Perhaps a self only AC spell be introduced at higher <br/>
levels to help out? Unlike other casters, Enchanters are forced to <br/>
engage mobs that are currently not attacking them in order to be <br/>
effective in performing their duties. With the use of charm and <br/>
mesmerise at high levels this is even more dangerous, yet Enchanters <br/>
get no new tools to really help in this. Even 700HP on Rune V won&#39;t <br/>
last more than a couple of rounds, and at a cost of 14p a cast.<br/>
 <br/>
GZ: Actually, Bards are beat on more then any other class in the <br/>
game. And no - Enchanters, need a party to help keep monsters off <br/>
them - it is a downside to being one of the most powerful classes in <br/>
EQ. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There you have it. :)<br/>
