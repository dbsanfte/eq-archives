<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013841623">Wow, grats Jacana! You now have something that is still on my &quot;wish&quot; <br/>
list to go get.  I am just not patient enough to go through the <br/>
spawns to make that thing trigger...that and I totally get lost in <br/>
FM&#39;s hehe.  Just seems to be the one zone I can&#39;t memorize the layout <br/>
to just yet.<br/>

&gt; Sunday Night (Australia) I was hunting with a group in Frontier <br/>
Mountains<br/>
&gt; when a shout came up about some ac 16 arm items that dropped.  The <br/>
loc was<br/>
&gt; given and off I ran.  Needless to say along the way I died *grin*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In trying to fetch my corpse I almost cried.  The power was <br/>
flickering a bit<br/>
&gt; and kept disconnecting the modem.  *sigh*  But I made it- I got my <br/>
corpse.<br/>
&gt; And visited over there a few times with the natives of Frontier <br/>
Mountain<br/>
&gt; close behind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A bit later a shout came up that the sleeves would drop again.  Ok <br/>
attempt<br/>
&gt; two.  I could not go much worse I thought.  Then all of the sudden <br/>
there was<br/>
&gt; the corpse at my feet at the Giant Fort.  And the sleeves were <br/>
mine.  Seems<br/>
&gt; the local druid felt bad that I died the first time and made sure I <br/>
could<br/>
&gt; get the sleeves again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am now the proud owner of a pair of the Sleeves of the Ancients :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yea :) And I made 28 Sunday and am merrily on my way to 29.  I <br/>
love those<br/>
&gt; giants :)  Slow exp but I am starting to make money again!<br/>
