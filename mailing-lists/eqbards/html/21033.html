No longer are inspired by the soul of their creator, rather they all have a<br/>
replacement soul, I wish them all well in their future endeavors.<br/>

I am sad to report that I have handed my account off to a few friends, to<br/>
carve up between them. My reasons are a bit personal, but it had nothing to<br/>
do with EQ, I LOVE playing, I was very very excited about taking Orphe<br/>
farther than I had gone with Tszaaz, but...it just isn&#39;t going to happen,<br/>
nor will I be popping up in UO AC or Anarchy Online.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for this list, it totally changed my experience of playing EQ.<br/>
The quality of the information and the maturity and positiveness of you all<br/>
really made it a great place to be. Thank you all again. <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t be quitting the list until I hear what Ester discovers, because I<br/>
just HAVE to know :o) but after that I will be fading away.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you all, keep your sheet music dry, swap in your weapons before<br/>
melee and make sure you are clear which icon is Cindas Carillon and which is<br/>
Kellins Lament...<br/>
