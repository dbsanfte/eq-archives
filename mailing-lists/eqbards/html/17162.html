For me, this song is always loaded when entering an area invis doesn&#39;t<br/>
work.  Say I&#39;m going to join a group assembling at the stone spider room<br/>
in solB (invis doesn&#39;t work against bats/bugs there), I progress slowly<br/>
through the corridors, peek around corners.  If I see something there, I<br/>
strafe (ctrl+left/right arrows) back and forth quickly to target it, but<br/>
not aggro it.  I then start the Lament, and just as it&#39;s about to pulse,<br/>
move out into view of the mob.  If timed appropriately, the pulse will<br/>
occur before the &quot;aggro check,&quot; allowing you to safely pass.  This<br/>
strategy works great in lower guk dead side also.<br/>
<br/>
Charisma is important for this; I can currently get to about 169 charisma<br/>
unbuffed, which I&#39;m sure is part of why it works most of the time<br/>
(certainly not all, which is why Screech is always mem&#39;d just below<br/>
Lament).<br/>
