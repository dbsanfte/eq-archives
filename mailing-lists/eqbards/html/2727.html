&lt;&lt; what can someone with a master pottery skill make?  i had a friend who was<br/>
 messing around with it make a medium clay jar, which i use to keep my food<br/>
 in under the rumor that it degenerates slower.  can larger jars be made?  my<br/>
 medium jar only has four spots.<br/>
 <br/>
 and heck i need something to do.  how do you get your pottery skill up,<br/>
 where at, and how much does it cost? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     Clay Jars are disgustingly heavy, though.  A medium one is 5 pounds (or <br/>
whatever unit of weight EQ uses).  I haven&#39;t seen any large jar sketches yet, <br/>
though I have yet to check Kaladim (I hate Zonecrasher... er... <br/>
Stormbreaker).  Most of pottery&#39;s products complement the baking skill which <br/>
is the main reason I took up pottery (it&#39;s more fun to make your own <br/>
supplies).  It&#39;s extremely easy to advance in as 75% of the tries result in <br/>
skill advances, but it is a hassle to run back and forth (thank Selo!) <br/>
between North Freeport and East Commons buying backpacks full of unstackable <br/>
items.  To get started, visit Merra Clayfinger in East Commonlands and buy <br/>
his pottery book.   It will tell you all you need to know.<br/>
<br/>
     Also, not only is baking fun, it can turn our heavy foraged food into <br/>
lightweight yummies. For those of us that didn&#39;t bother to increase STR, it <br/>
does make a difference.  I&#39;m usually carrying around 6 different types of <br/>
foraged food (I can sustain myself using forage except for water) and that <br/>
adds up to about 3 pounds.  Baked products have a weight of only 0.1.  If you <br/>
are going to eat your own food, I would suggest against reading some of the <br/>
recipes... :)<br/>
