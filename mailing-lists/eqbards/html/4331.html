<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649437137">It sure would be nice to have some more magic instruments in the game. After<br/>
much consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm) would be a regular<br/>
ol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You awaken in the<br/>
Arena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to cross...wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
wonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory? No, we can&#39;t<br/>
bind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you could really<br/>
leverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum. Sure, I keep one<br/>
in the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning to the bank to<br/>
get it is just not what I have patience for after dying... Just a thought,<br/>
one born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>
