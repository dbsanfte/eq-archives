<div id="ygrps-yiv-896059127">Okay, semi newbie question here since I never really<br/>
gave it any thought:<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys use in your neck spot?  I was using a<br/>
+9 cha piece of jewelry simply because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
think of anything else, but I switched to a cape of<br/>
midnight mist (+5 str +7 save magic ac 2).  I&#39;ll keep<br/>
the +9 cha piece of jewelry for charming and pixie<br/>
striking but I can&#39;t see wearing it around when 90% of<br/>
what I do is chains and manasong (usual group is<br/>
war/cle/enc/wiz/sha, its silly for me to try and out<br/>
buff any of them).  The other 10% consists of &quot;I AM<br/>
PLAYING MANASONG.&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
