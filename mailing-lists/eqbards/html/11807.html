<div id="ygrps-yiv-406775950">Off course I post about what makes me happy - I see you have no problems<br/>
developing your own list.<br/>
<br/>
To each his own - my point is, you hit level 50 - then what? I&#39;m not trying<br/>
to take away anything from your experience - perhaps broaden your horizons<br/>
just a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in my apparently inept way - I&#39;m advising you to stop and smell the<br/>
flowers. Value those around you a bit more - appreciate the little things<br/>
that can make for a fuller experience.<br/>
<br/>
That is the one fatal flaw EQ made that will probably forever keep it from<br/>
being a true virtual world - the level system denotes an end.<br/>

&gt;&gt; You must have missed my post where I said I don&#39;t EVER care if I level<br/>
&gt;&gt; again past 23. I&#39;ll probably never see SolB - nor do I particularly care<br/>

&gt;  You are in the minority I can assure you.  If you enjoy fishing,<br/>
&gt;  baking, brewing, telling stories around the campfire, then that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  your POV.  I&#39;m not gonna waste 10bux a month to essentially IRC<br/>
&gt;  with pretty graphics.  I want to advance, I want to have some<br/>
&gt;  goodies, and I want to show those goodies off to people because<br/>
&gt;  I spent the time to earn them.  I want to be a powerful element<br/>
&gt;  to plane attacks and dragon raids.  I was in a group last night<br/>
&gt;  that dinged two L49 people to L50.  L50 people are turning out like<br/>
&gt;  mad.  I&#39;m feeling the crunch too.  Nagafen&#39;s Lair and Lower Guk<br/>
&gt;  are becoming so crowded that it&#39;s rare to even see monsters, let<br/>
&gt;  alone fight them.  I know for a fact that there are at least 100<br/>
&gt;  L50 people on Innoruuk and we add one more avg each day it seems.<br/>
&gt;  When 1/16th of your server&#39;s population is 50, and probably another<br/>
&gt;  3/16th is L35+ that spells trouble and crowding.  Trying to squeeze<br/>
&gt;  a quarter of the server into two zones really hurts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The whole premise behind your posts is what makes you, yourself<br/>
&gt;  happy.  I honestly find your selfish ripostes to comments about<br/>
&gt;  the whole community very weak and one sided.  What I didn&#39;t miss <br/>
&gt;  is your careless attitude, however.  Whatever makes silky&#39;s 10<br/>
&gt;  dollars count isn&#39;t why I play the game, btw.  And while I respect<br/>
&gt;  anyone&#39;s opinion including yours, you are very much lacking the<br/>
&gt;  delivery of your opinion in an organized, non-offensive manner. <br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s like you&#39;ve got something to prove about yourself, and at<br/>
&gt;  the same time you trying to disprove any statement that comes <br/>
&gt;  down the pipe.  It&#39;s a rare day to see you post complimenting <br/>
&gt;  anything.  I suppose I can continue wishing. 8)<br/>
