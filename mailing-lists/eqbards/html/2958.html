<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062856470">Okay, one thing you guys need to be watching for, regardless of connection<br/>
speed: IF you are using an internal modem, is it a WINModem, i.e. does it<br/>
use<br/>
processor time to function as a portion of the modem transmissions?<br/>
WINModems<br/>
can eat up an incredible amount of processor time, esp. when<br/>
sending/receiving<br/>
a large amount of small packets.  If you are unsure if you have a WINModem,<br/>
answer these questions:<br/>
Is it internal? (If yes, continue)<br/>
Is it a USRobotics/3COM? (If no, continue)<br/>
Is it from some &#39;other&#39; modem maker you have never heard of? (if yes,<br/>
continue)<br/>
Is your computer &#39;pre-made&#39; with a modem, i.e. Packard Bell? (if yes,<br/>
continue)<br/>
*(If you have a Gateway, the higher end modems are actually USR&#39;s, renamed,<br/>
and stickered)<br/>
<br/>
If you have answered yes to all/most of these questions, then you should<br/>
consider<br/>
trying to &#39;borrow&#39; an external modem, or a USR from somebody, and see if<br/>
that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Again, you will be losing alot of precious processing time, just when you<br/>
need it,<br/>
during a major battle, to your modem trying to send/receive.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with other types of modems: if you are using a cable modem or DSL<br/>
modem, plugged into a NIC<br/>
in your machine, make sure you are using a quality NIC, i.e. Intel or 3COM.<br/>
Cheap<br/>
NIC&#39;s are made similar to WINModems, in that they use processor time instead<br/>
of onboard<br/>
hardware to process network traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that gives you a bit of insight,<br/>

&gt; Heh!  I have you all beat ;p  I&#39;m running a Cyrix 233Mhz w/64Mb RAM and a<br/>
&gt; crappy lil&#39; back-woods ruraal connection that allows me a MAX connect rate<br/>
&gt; of 24k on my 56k modem (Old phone lines), and can still twist 3 songs<br/>
&gt; (unless in a group or on a real laggy connection).  If I can do it, you<br/>
&gt; folks can too :o)~<br/>

&gt; &gt;Not sure John, I have a RIVA TNT and I have been able to twist 3 songs,<br/>
&gt; &gt;exactly once successfully.  It a P3 450 with 128m RAM also.  I<br/>
&gt; can twist 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;no problem usually, but whenever I hit a summoning animation its hell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Course I have everything on, particle, 2 layer sky, etc.  I&#39;m probably<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt;held back by my connection but there is no dsl in my neighborhood yet.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; The advantage is in twisting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; spells due to screen saturation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>
&gt; &gt;end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>
&gt; &gt;got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>
&gt; &gt;off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>
&gt; &gt;from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>
&gt; &gt;speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; &gt;to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>
&gt; &gt;with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>
&gt; &gt;side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; &gt;recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>
&gt; &gt;a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>
&gt; &gt;un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>
&gt; &gt;system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>
&gt; &gt;of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>
&gt; &gt;the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>
&gt; &gt;delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>
