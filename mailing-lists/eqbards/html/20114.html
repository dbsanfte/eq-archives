&gt;monk are our guild&#39;s only tanks. (our warrior recently quit EQ sadly)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Attack speedup songs are pointless as the &#39;chanter Alacrity&#39;s all the tanks<br/>
&gt;and that&#39;s better than any speedups I have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, that&#39;s fine.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well chains also decreases mob attack speed.  maybe you should communicate with<br/>
him and chain the first 2/3 of the fight, and then snare at about 1/3 health before he<br/>
starts to run.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It all comes down to the same problem really.  A bard is an awesome way to<br/>
&gt;make up for the lack of having a particular type of caster in your group<br/>
&gt;whatever that missing type might be.  If you have all the major types<br/>
&gt;covered though, we look like lousy psuedo-tanks with some interesting<br/>
&gt;secondary abilities.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i seem to always find a way to contribute to a group, regardless of the makeup.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It goes back to my previous bard complaint from way back, being a third rate<br/>
&gt;everything does not necessarily balance out with being best at something.<br/>
&gt;If there was a better balance between casters and melee classes in EQ we<br/>
&gt;would instantly become more useful as any given group would be more likely<br/>
&gt;to be missing some type they needed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t agree that we are third rate at everything, but that&#39;s just my personal opinion.<br/>
if you actually believe this, then why play a bard?  it seems that a lot of your <br/>
dissatisfaction comes from your vision of a bard not agreeing with how a bard is<br/>
really implemented in everquest.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When was the last time you entered a zone to see shouts of &quot;Bard wanted for<br/>
&gt;group&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lots of times.  and yeah if they ask for an enchanter, sometimes they really just<br/>
need clarity so you can skate in on that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;d answer never.  Every time I play I see &quot;Cleric needed for group&quot;, or<br/>
&gt;&quot;Enchanter needed for group&quot;, or &quot;2 Tanks needed for group&quot;.  I may not get<br/>
&gt;refused by groups but the first question is always &quot;Do you have manasong?&quot;<br/>
&gt;(I play Anon)  The response is always &quot;Oh.  Darn&quot;.  If Lullaby worked even<br/>
&gt;marginally I&#39;d start ansewring those &quot;enchanter wanted&quot; shouts and see if<br/>
&gt;they were really &quot;Clarity wanted&quot;.<br/>
