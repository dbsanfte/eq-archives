pauldrons (no drop shoulders with +dex found in solB).  It&#39;s served me<br/>
well for a very, very long time.  For a warrior, I would think they&#39;d<br/>
prefer shoulders with a little more AC.  I tend to lean toward stats over<br/>
AC (looks too, naturally), as I am never under fire like the tanks.<br/>
Things attack me because I try to mez them, or because they just woke up<br/>
from being mez&#39;d.  I know my role in a group, and taking hits is no longer<br/>
part of it.<br/>
