<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411688262">i got a diamondine relatively cheap (1k) from a warrior friend who got an<br/>
ivandyr&#39;s hoop to wear instead, and my other is an opalline.  i bugged a<br/>
druid camping sol a for a runed lava pendant for 2 days before he finally<br/>
sold me one for 3k (dunno if that is good or bad, but i hear good, and last<br/>
one i saw at auction was 4500pp).  and crested i got in all of one /auction<br/>
in north freeport, and they are super cheap.  HBC&#39;s are going for 15k on my<br/>
server =/<br/>
<br/>
out of all my raids, i only cashed in points on my selo&#39;s drum (i got a<br/>
dragonbone bracer as well, but before we instituted the points system).<br/>
there are 4 or 5 horns in the treasury as no one even wants to use 1 point<br/>
on them.  i figure if something in expansion is worth getting a horn, there<br/>
will be one available.  i am saving up to get in on a CoF/RBB lotto, but it<br/>
may never happen as a few people have a lot more points than me.  but if i<br/>
put in my time, and the rules think a bard is worthy of being in the lotto<br/>
(it says melee before others in the rules, so that includes bards), and i<br/>
have the points, then i will go in on the lotto.<br/>
<br/>
you&#39;re lucky, i had to sweat out getting a lot of my equipment.  now it&#39;s<br/>
all the bards who go on these raids with me around who have it easy, getting<br/>
stuff by default.<br/>
<br/>
if you get what&#39;s on your wish list, you&#39;ll have the highest bard AC i have<br/>
been able to find from asking around .  should put you at 820+ at least.<br/>
without a shield of course.  with a shield and the best he could find, a<br/>
monk in our guild has gotten to 1070/1000 AC.<br/>

&gt; Hooded black cloak, crested spaulders and runed lava pendant <br/>
&gt; are currently<br/>
&gt; on my want list.  Was considering diamondines, but they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; hella hard to<br/>
&gt; come by it seems (too lazy to camp them myself) and if I did <br/>
&gt; get any, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; probably give them to my monk first.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been very fortunate in my equipment, in that 90% of the <br/>
&gt; time I&#39;m the<br/>
&gt; only bard around.  I&#39;ve never really had to worry about loot <br/>
&gt; squabbles, I<br/>
&gt; tend to get items mainly because nobody else is there to claim them.<br/>
