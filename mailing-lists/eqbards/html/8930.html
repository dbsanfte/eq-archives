Basically, any outdoor zone is good for this song.  I first<br/>
used it in Everfrost getting mammoths to fight each other<br/>
(they are about L25, and usually drop a tusk that sells for<br/>
10pp - accounted for my first 100pp night).  Tidal lords in<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron are good too if you can find two.  I hear<br/>
the aviaks are good too, but I&#39;ve never fought them.  Lizards<br/>
in Cazic are good too, if you can find an open section of the<br/>
courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
Indoors you have to be careful about starting a green<br/>
train.  Since you&#39;re usually charming stuff that&#39;s blue to<br/>
you, stuff that&#39;s green and won&#39;t attack you *will* sometimes<br/>
attack your pet.  But if the immediate area is clear, you can<br/>
use the song indoors as well.<br/>
