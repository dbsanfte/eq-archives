<div id="ygrps-yiv-761804157">I again spoke with GM-Hideaki last night, he told me he did indeed<br/>
brainstorm with GZ regarding bard songs and they &quot;talked for a long time&quot;<br/>
about additive bard song abilities.  A skill based version of this,<br/>
possibly Harmonize?  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also due on a answer regarding number of bard songs per level; 1 per<br/>
level is grossly out of line with other hybrid upgrades and the<br/>
anticipated degree of difficulty.  I had suggested 2 per level, 1 if we<br/>
also got a new skill.<br/>
<br/>
They are looking forward to seeing our email, I told Hideaki I&#39;d try my<br/>
best to have it to him Thursday.  So... any help I can get polishing the<br/>
document would be greatly appreciated.  This is our chance to have real<br/>
input, even if all we can be guaranteed is that they will in fact read it.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it is sounding quite promising!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to add a section to the letter called &quot;Known Issues&quot; and in that<br/>
section I&#39;d like to place a copy of John(tm)&#39;s Lullaby analysis, the no<br/>
mana address, and what ever else is broke with us.  Please no flames,<br/>
rational, well structure and well written entries are the best ways to<br/>
convey our grievances.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ve tried hard not to make judgements on individual ideas since I<br/>
don&#39;t want to discourage anyone; I&#39;ve just garnered the ideas that seemed<br/>
to spark the most interest and discussion, however here is one of the best<br/>
sent to me that addresses clouding, invis and invis vs undead in a clean<br/>
salient fashion: bestow an invis vs undead component to coulding via the<br/>
use of Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo.  This would alleviate the very valid<br/>
rogue concerns as the Piccolo is a rare nostats nodrop lore god drop and<br/>
certainly warrants some sort of upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
I will be adding Warcry, broadly the Psalms of the Seasons, potential song<br/>
names (inputs welcome!) and the discussion on healing.  Someone emailed me<br/>
regarding a Feign Death song.  I&#39;ve heard rumors the skill Feign Death<br/>
possibly being given to bards.  Comments on either?<br/>
<br/>
REV 0 will be out late tonight with clean and clear formatting.  Unless<br/>
something big spawns. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

PS: S O S  Any help is greatly appreciated! ;)<br/>
