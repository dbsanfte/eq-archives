<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490982547"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I am also only playing the 1-2 hours a day and a death do often mean that after<br/>
&gt;corpse retrival its time to leave. I still don&#39;t think that people should be<br/>
&gt;allowed to bind right by the action places. Why? If that was the case you will<br/>
&gt;see a lot more kamikaze pilots around. People will NOT see death as a major<br/>
&gt;thing.<br/>
&gt; Travelling back to your corpse is IMO the only REAL penalty by dying. At<br/>
&gt;higher levels and in the right parties the clerics resurrect line of spells,<br/>
&gt;reduce the travelling time to a &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT...&quot;. Lastly it would ruin<br/>
&gt;the erie feeling of being in an unknown zone far away from home, which I kinda<br/>
&gt;like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must disagree here, I don&#39;t see any of my caster friends becoming kamikaze<br/>
pilots because they&#39;re bound close by.  I also have to say that the penalty from<br/>
death is not the run,  but the exp loss which translates into time lost.  If I<br/>
die twice in a night, that negates my entire 2 hour play window, experience<br/>
wise.  Add to that the ADDITIONAL penalty that only melee player must pay, which<br/>
is an additional half hour of downtime to return, while the party is gaining<br/>
exp.<br/>
<br/>
For me, that equates to (30 min out of 2 hours)   an additional 25 percent exp<br/>
penalty.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line, for me anyway, is that I play EQ to have fun and play with my<br/>
friends.  Running by myself, for half an hour over the same, familiar terrain,<br/>
while my friends are having fun together, is crappy.  And it irks me that not<br/>
all players have to suffer through this.  Either we all bind in cities only, or<br/>
we all bind anywhere.  Don&#39;t single out the melee classes for less play time and<br/>
less exp for the same monthly fee.<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.  Sorry...starting to foam at the mouth :)<br/>
