Karana rebooted and I was the first player in Oasis (the<br/>
server selection screen said &quot;Karana 0&quot;).  I ran around the<br/>

If you were playing in Oasis back around May/June, you&#39;ll<br/>
recall times when there were as many as 8 giants on your<br/>
screen at once.<br/>

In the patch messages, their rationale for nerfing the spawn<br/>
was complaints about too many giants/griffins crashing folks<br/>
killing orcs and gators.  It happened shortly after the<br/>
fanfare about the first player to reach level 50 though.  So I<br/>
have to wonder if this wasn&#39;t typical Verant double speak, and<br/>
their real intent was to give the higher level folks fewer<br/>
things to hunt to slow down their leveling.<br/>

expect them to split the other servers, starting with the most<br/>
