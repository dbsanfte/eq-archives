think those four levels makes an enormous difference with these mobs...<br/>

No biggie with Chardok - we had a couple of 50+ clerics in our raid - so<br/>
rez&#39;s weren&#39;t a problem.<br/>

 Slyde, you have trouble charming? I use charm all the time, and have saved<br/>
our group by keeping a chromodrake under control when he invited himself to<br/>
our wyvern party more than once. I charm in chardok alot too, just have MR<br/>
trouble out of the manglers. I wonder what the difference is, that I do<br/>
fairly well with charm and you have trouble. I don&#39;t have particularly high<br/>
charis, and don&#39;t use special gear for charming.<br/>

PS. Sorry about Chardok the other night, monk misjudged his aggro and one<br/>
mangler went to get his pals on the way in.<br/>
