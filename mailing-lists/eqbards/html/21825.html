<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330956127">I think you misinterpreted Kaearia (John Kim&#39;s) position.  He stated he did not think Verant was maliciously screwing over bards.  Instead, he thinks that they are a bunch of idiots who have no idea what they are doing in regards to bards.  So he is no longer going to worry about trying to use logic, statistical analysis, etc. to fight for improvements to the bard class since they don&#39;t have a clue what they are doing.  Thats the way I interpreted his post.<br/>

have a lot of problems with the way verant is handling the issues either, at least<br/>
with regard to gordon&#39;s monster post.<br/>
