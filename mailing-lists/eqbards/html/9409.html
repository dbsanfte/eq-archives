<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585601139">At 22, I was dragged out to Lake Rathe by a guild bro of mine.  We went down<br/>
the inlet between the barb village and the gypsies.  There is an aviak tower<br/>
there with two guards that are about lvl 19 or 20.  If you can get back<br/>
there, you&#39;ll get suh-weeeeeeet experience up to about 24.  At that point,<br/>
head over to Hermie&#39;s hut in SK.  Stay there til 28, good money AND exp!  (I<br/>
learned the fine art of Fear/Chain there  heh!)  I&#39;ve found that if I can<br/>
find a good spot for blue cons to spawn, I can make MUCH MORE experience<br/>
than in any group.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you reconsider,<br/>
