<div id="ygrps-yiv-102004083"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ll have to test it again with my enchanter friend (or anyone<br/>
&gt; else here can if they have the time).  Stronger effects are<br/>
&gt; supposed to override weaker ones, and weaker ones aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; supposed to take hold over stronger ones.  Maybe the shaman<br/>
&gt; drowsy spells are bugged in this regard.  Do they do anything<br/>
&gt; except slow down the mob?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Not that I&#39;m aware of.  But I&#39;m not certain how the server handles<br/>
  dual nature effects.  Is 100% slowdown stronger than 30% slowdown<br/>
  with movement reduction?  Along the same lines as, is movement<br/>
  reduction (snare) stronger than 30% slowdown and minor movement<br/>
  reduction.  I&#39;m just not sure, without extensive testing.<br/>
