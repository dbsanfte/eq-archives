If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
<br/>
So now you&#39;re trying to tell me Lullaby is only for interrupting casters?<br/>
Not true, when it works it definitely causes a mob to stand there and do<br/>
nothing until hit or the duration ends.  However, it is broken.  Perhaps<br/>
last nights example can make this clear to you.  I was running thru BB and<br/>
paused to watch a couple of people fighting near the entrance in case they<br/>
need help.  After a bit I punched up a song to run again and hit the wrong<br/>
button, Lullaby.  I got the following, obviously incorrect results.<br/>
<br/>
	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
<br/>
The incorrect part is the three gnoll pups then ran over to me and started<br/>
attacking immediately.  The song did absolutely nothing to the gnoll pups<br/>
except add me to their hate list.  Absolutely nothing.  As soon as the<br/>
effect hit them they zipped over to me and started attacking.  I stood there<br/>
with the song up waiting just for experimentation.  It took 12 pulses, all<br/>
successful nods by the way, no resists, before all three gnoll pups stopped<br/>
attacking.  Now no matter what class I was playing if I cast a spell on a<br/>
mob and got the message showing it failed to resist and the song had no<br/>
effect I would be upset.  The majority of my issues have as little to do<br/>
with the bard class specifically as with Verant&#39;s attitude towards bugs in<br/>
general.  If they are beneficial fix them immediately!  If they are<br/>
negative, fix them when they get around to it.  This attitude is compounded<br/>
by the fact that Verant very apparently never, ever, considers the effects<br/>
of their code changes on bards.  I mean wtf?  It took them 6 months of our<br/>
saying that Alenia&#39;s did not do anything before they bothered to look into<br/>
it?  Had someone instead complained that Alenia&#39;s was removing all buffs<br/>
from every mob in the zone about 1 time in 1000 it would have been looked<br/>
into instantly and an immediate patch put in if it was found to be true.<br/>
Being versatile is no recompense for being ignored and dismissed as<br/>
unimportant.<br/>
