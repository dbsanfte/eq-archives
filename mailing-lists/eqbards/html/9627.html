<div id="ygrps-yiv-679735836"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What is the best way to get out of level 35?  I have been level 35 for a<br/>
&gt;week now and my group is power leveling away from me.  I need to get thru<br/>
&gt;this hell level a.s.a.p.!  Help!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The basement in unrest with a cleric and druid did me wonders. I started <br/>
there about halfway through 37 and made it to 39 in a day and a half of <br/>
playing.  You&#39;d need a bigger group to get into th ghost room, but its easy <br/>
enough to break the spawn and the exp is great down there!<br/>
