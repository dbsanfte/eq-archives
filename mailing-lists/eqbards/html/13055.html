<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428478383">I noticed this with my monk last night.  I was soloing in Highpass,<br/>
competing with a group for kills.  Even though there was 5 of them beating<br/>
on the orc, I _missed_ with a triple attack, and it went after me. :)<br/>

&quot;A rogue BS does good...when it does good damage.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t think the damage dealt has anything to do with it. I happenenned to<br/>
taunt MOBs pf a pal missing a BS with ,y rogue. I think it&#39;s the same way<br/>
with every attack (be it melee or spell) : you can hit for full, partial or<br/>
miss / be resisted, the taunt effect is the same, at least it seemed to be<br/>
in my experience.<br/>
