<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885146265">Just as a sort of aside...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been kicking myself J.M. Since I joined the list I deleted your emails <br/>
without reading them because I receive them as .txt attachments :P Only in <br/>
the past couple of days have I realized the wealth of knowledge you impart <br/>
within them! Big d&#39;oh. Not sure why I&#39;m receiving attachments though, <br/>
probably cuz I&#39;m using MS products and you&#39;re on a *nix machine? Doesn&#39;t <br/>
really matter, I&#39;m hooked now ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have a few oints to throw to the list...<br/>
First, isn&#39;t it a bit of a shame that just about all the information we <br/>
know about Norrath comes from not being logged into the game? Wish there <br/>
were more built-in ways to access information from NPC&#39;s or through quests. <br/>
Makes sense to me that a class as well-travelled as Bards would have a good <br/>
network of NPC-provided info. Rogues would *really* rule at this, but we&#39;d <br/>
not be too far behind. As an aside, I wish our spellbook would give a brief <br/>
description of the songs and the instrument needed to improve/play them <br/>
when we R-click on them.<br/>
<br/>
Second: What *IS* it with mob&#39;s jumping us like crazy now?! This happened <br/>
to me until about lvl 12 or so (if I remember correctly) - I&#39;ve easily died <br/>
about 50 times in Paw (myself and a friend were the first to explore it on <br/>
my server - absolutely nobody in Paw for a while, the occasional Druid in S <br/>
Karana - but even that was a &quot;Whoah, someone else is here!&quot; type deal, rare <br/>
to see people even in E Kar... so not knowing anything about all those <br/>
zones led to a buuuuuunch of deaths ;) and although most were either from <br/>
ignorance or stupidity I also remember getting quite frustrated at the way <br/>
we seemed to attract monsters like flies to an Ogre&#39;s fingernails. But this <br/>
seemed to cool down a little, it ended up not being so bad once I moved on <br/>
to other places so I thought it&#39;d been &#39;fixed&#39;. That hope has been <br/>
shattered :P It&#39;s funny now more than frustrating because I pretty much <br/>
escape from any deadly situation these days but it does seem to suddenly  <br/>
 have gone waaaaay out of whack. I&#39;m being jumped by 80% of what crosses my <br/>
screen in most places. This the way things are meant to be?<br/>
<br/>
Question about Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding (our lvl 20 song): This slows the <br/>
mob&#39;s attack-speed down? (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s something barely perceptible, <br/>
but in the long-run is of great benefit) It lowers AC too? (ditto?) ... <br/>
Does it actually slow the mob down in a root/entangle sort of way? Not <br/>
noticed that, probably just an unfounded rumour. And can it be twisted? Do <br/>
the effects last for pulses like many others?<br/>
I&#39;m going to experiment with it and see how it works out for me personally <br/>
but what are other bards&#39; opinions? Do you use it a lot? Found it better at <br/>
higher levels? (something I particularly like about our class) Any comments <br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Soloing: I really enjoy soloing, it&#39;s been pretty effective for me so <br/>
far... if you&#39;re in your 16&#39;s-19&#39;s I recommend you check out E Karana if <br/>
you want to solo and see how it works out for you. There&#39;s plenty of <br/>
Reavers, Dark Stalkers, Spirit Stalkers and Gorge Hounds that you can kite <br/>
for a while to soften them up before hacking the buggers to pieces and if <br/>
you run into trouble it&#39;s very easy to just... run out of it ;)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly!: Weapons - I checked out Lavastorm and Najena, spent a couple of <br/>
days there recently and they&#39;re pretty sweet zones. Problem was nobody in <br/>
that part of the world has a clue what bards are for or what we&#39;re capable <br/>
of so I only managed to group once for a short while despite my GREAT <br/>
innate charm &lt;g&gt; - it&#39;s wasted on the Tier&#39;dal, either they RP really well <br/>
or some really obnoxious people choose to play them, cuz they are helluva <br/>
hard to approach :P Killed a bunch of TT&#39;s that one time I did group but <br/>
didn&#39;t get any whips :/ However there is now a Troll and a DE Cleric <br/>
wandering around hooting at how much fun Bards are and how well we reduce <br/>
down-time, etc... Anyways, having given up on getting a Whip I moved on and <br/>
am now in Unrest/Cauldron. Any good piercing or 1H slash weapons for a lvl <br/>
20er available in those places? I&#39;m currently using a Fine Steel Rapier and <br/>
a Combine LS.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! Someone mentioned lots of our skills capping at 40... My sneak is 60 <br/>
and rising. Keep at it folks, EQ rewards the patient ;)<br/>
