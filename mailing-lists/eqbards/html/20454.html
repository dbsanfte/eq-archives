<div id="ygrps-yiv-667204593">Anyone notice a change in Pixie Strike?  I have used it before and gotten<br/>
resisted quite a bit, but last night was the first time I ever saw the<br/>
secondary resist message like Lullaby has.  Was this added at the same time<br/>
as Lullaby&#39;s was or later?  It was taking me 3-4 applications to get it to<br/>
stick which made it useless for mezzing casters.  Granted I was using it on<br/>
high blues and whites, but why would I want to mez a green caster that<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand up to the group for 20 seconds anyhow???<br/>
<br/>
I was singing nothing but Pixie Strike against a blue necro trying to hold<br/>
her off while the group was busy and the necro was able to keep me almost<br/>
continually stunned with fear while I was only able to interrupt her once or<br/>
twice.  Looks like this is another song I will demem until they fix it.<br/>
When fighting high blues and whites it has not worked well enough to be<br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
