<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981486310">I myself soloed from 19 until 24 by fighting gorge hounds in East Karana, it<br/>
wasnt difficult.  We can solo all the way if we want, simply Bellow and<br/>
Selo.  It just takes a tremendous amount of time and becomes extremely<br/>
tedious to do much without a group later on.  Sure I could kill mass amounts<br/>
of light light blue stuff, but why when I could be in a hag killing party or<br/>
take on familiars and sages in mistmoore?  You just plain get to see more of<br/>
the game with a bard than with almost any other character.  I would have to<br/>
say that us wearing plate is a bit ridiculous, try to play a guitar in a<br/>
full suit of platemail.  And it has gotten me in trouble more times than<br/>
not.  People think I must be a great tank, since even rangers cant wear<br/>
plate, and will let me take the brunt of damage before they realize the<br/>
plate is purely for show.<br/>
