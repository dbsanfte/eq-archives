&gt; Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>
&gt; will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>
&gt; upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>
&gt; L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>
&gt; see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>
&gt; party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>
&gt; which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>
&gt; damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>
&gt; -----------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just curious as I am much lower level than you and thus my experience may <br/>
&gt; not be quite as extensive, but are you working damage upon multiple mobs at <br/>
&gt; once into the equation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, one on one, I have no doubts you are correct.  But I wonder about <br/>
&gt; group on group.........<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope I&#39;m not factoring in multiple mobs. Call me timid, but at a level<br/>
where mobs can each hit me for 85+ hp, I think getting 3 or 4 frenzying<br/>
on me is bad tactics.<br/>
