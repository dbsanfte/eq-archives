&gt;Wow awesome expedition.  I assume this is before they beefed up the zone<br/>
&gt;last night?  If it was after, then even more impressive.  After they made<br/>
&gt;the zone even tougher, i heard even groups of your caliber were slaughtered.<br/>
&gt;And one other question...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The bracers are No Drop did YOU get them???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We didnt get any bracers, just arms. My friend tinen (lvl 41 bard) got the<br/>
arms since we where randoming everything that was obtained between the<br/>
classes that could use them. Me and tinen nearly fell over laughing when we<br/>
found the first bard only item since we where the only 2 bards. But alas,<br/>
he got the first item, and we didnt find anymore for the night since we<br/>
gated out shortly after that. All of this was on the first day, before they<br/>
made it supposedly harder. The next day an elite (snicker) team went in to<br/>
rez all the bodies that had accumulated from the day before from people who<br/>
just zoned in and started exploring. Me (for the corpse location song), a<br/>
lvl 50 cleric, and a lvl 45 druid would take one person at a time in and<br/>
rez and evac them out. We never got jumped once we entered the gate, we<br/>
could stand as long as we wanted to by the gate and nothing would attack<br/>
us. Several silver backs ran right over me, but never attacked, like they<br/>
where not even agro. We did not engage anything however since we where just<br/>
helping people get their corpses back. This was AFTER the zone broadcast<br/>
that they had made the zone even rougher... so i dont know for sure what is<br/>
exactly harder, though i have heard rumors of beasts hitting for 200 and<br/>
backstabbing for 500. We keep trying to get another expedition going but<br/>
all the high lvl clerics went up and went on vacation :p<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we are hoping to have 3 45+ clerics and if so its off to the fear<br/>
plane for us. One tactic i highly recommend: Get a zone wall to your back<br/>
as soon as possible. That cuts down on a whole 180 degrees that you do not<br/>
have to watch. A corner is even better. We tried fighting from the hill by<br/>
the gate and its just not a good idea. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, just about every freaking item we got was no drop. Scratch that.<br/>
EVERY item we got was no drop, and we got at least 5 items if not more. I<br/>
dont pay any attention unless i want it :).  Except for those monk only<br/>
gloves that gave serpentvision, i play a human bard and would LOVE those, i<br/>
hate turning into a de everytime i want ultravision.  <br/>
