<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251177539"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just a quick off topic question:  Did you see DS <br/>
&gt; respawn at all in the 8 hours you were there?  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard rumors that she has random chance of <br/>
&gt; respawning every 2 hours.. also that she&#39;s on an <br/>
&gt; 8, 12, 24, 72 hour timer.  (I know 72 isn&#39;t the <br/>
&gt; case, but I&#39;ve heard that rumor :b)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny you should mention this -- we are trying to figure the same <br/>
thing out. Both times we have done an 8+ hour camp back there, we <br/>
have never seen her respawn. Actually, I think you have a better <br/>
chance of everyone walking out with new Druid boots, than to see a <br/>
second Dru.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Back on topic:  Did your raid let you split her <br/>
&gt; room with Lull?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. Luckily, Dragon&#39;s Claw is blessed with some of the best (if not <br/>
the best with Shaquil) pullers on the server. We have always split <br/>
this room with our monks.<br/>
