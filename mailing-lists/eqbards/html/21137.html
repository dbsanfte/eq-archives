Guide to the Plane of Hate Mobs: <br/>
<br/>
There are 14 different mobs in Hate, and each is different. <br/>
<br/>
Cleric of Innoruuk - Cleric - They look like a Dark Elf guard. They have<br/>
high magic resist, so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal. They<br/>
also buff the mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them stunned (bash/<br/>
slam) while fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear. They do not<br/>
see rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Ire Ghast - undead Shadow Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic<br/>
resist, so easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot. Undead magic<br/>
works on them. They drop some Paladin weapons. They do not see rogues, but<br/>
do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead would work). They<br/>
have a small aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Revultant Rat - Warrior - They look like a giant diseased rat and have low<br/>
magic resist, but proc Deadly Poison. Only drop is a Ranger Whip. They do<br/>
not see rogues or normal invis. They have a small aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Spite Golem - Shaman - They look like a rock golem. They have insane magic<br/>
resist (although poison, disease, and the post-50 wizard spells will usually<br/>
stick). This is the most important target most times. If you get 2, one<br/>
warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy while the<br/>
group kills number 1. It is possible to kill several, but very, very tough,<br/>
so be careful. They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything close<br/>
to them. They drop shaman gear. They do not see a rogue, but see everything<br/>
else. They have a large aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Loathing Lich - undead Wizard - They look like a spectre and have very low<br/>
magic resist and fewer hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead so undead<br/>
magic works well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard<br/>
damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a Necromancer<br/>
rod. They DO see a rogue as well as anything else. *** BE CAREFUL *** They<br/>
have a small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very<br/>
large range. <br/>
<br/>
Abhorrent - Rogue - They look like gargoyles and have very low magic resist,<br/>
but love to backstab, so make sure the puller is careful pulling them. They<br/>
drop rogue gear. They do not see rogues or normal invisible. They have a<br/>
small aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Haunted Chest - Enchanter - They look like a bog box with teeth. They do not<br/>
charm or otherwise debuff, but they will pillage enchantments, so could call<br/>
them Enchanters, or just a warrior with a Pumise Stone. They can drop any<br/>
item from the Planes of Hate or Fear. They do not see a rogue, but do see<br/>
others. They have an very small aggro range and are very slow. When pulling,<br/>
the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget and go home. They even<br/>
aggro other mobs at a very short range. Boxes spawn only in fixed locations.<br/>
They are not on any other spawn table. <br/>
<br/>
Kiraikueis - undead Monk - They look like a mummy and have low magic resist.<br/>
They will proc Strong Disease. They are undead, so undead magic works well<br/>
on them. They drop warrior gear and a monk Shuriken. They do not see rogues,<br/>
but do see normal invis, though invis to undead would work. They have a very<br/>
large aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro with<br/>
anything close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually. <br/>
<br/>
Scorn Banshee - undead Warrior - They look like a female zombie and have low<br/>
magic resist, but proc Strong Disease and hit a ton. But undead magic works.<br/>
They drop Bard gear. They DO see rogues and all invis, including invis to<br/>
undead, regardless of what con says. *** BE CAREFUL *** They do have a small<br/>
aggro range, though. <br/>
<br/>
Forsaken Revanant, Male - undead Magician - They look like male vampires and<br/>
have normal magic resistance. They also cast a mean damage shield and nasty<br/>
AE direct damage. Undead magic does work. They drop mage gear. They do not<br/>
see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range. <br/>
<br/>
Forsaken Revanant, Female - undead Enchanter - They look like female<br/>
vampires and have high magic resistance, but they do not cast charm. They do<br/>
cast a damage shield, though. Undead magic works. They drop Enchanter gear.<br/>
They do not see rogues but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro<br/>
range. <br/>
<br/>
Ashenbone Drake - Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon or a small<br/>
DracoLiche from Fear. They have high magic resist and love to cast Fear,<br/>
plus they hit like a tank. They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield or<br/>
weapon. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have an insane<br/>
aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone. Be extremely<br/>
careful on this one&#39;s aggro. <br/>
<br/>
Maestro of Rancor - Bard - Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but since he hasn&#39;t<br/>
been seen in a long time, I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro. He is a<br/>
Bard, but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he&#39;s a warrior. He<br/>
hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range. And if he has<br/>
dual weapons, he hits extremely fast. He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard<br/>
stuff, though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues<br/>
and all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem. He<br/>
is the lesser boss of Hate. <br/>
<br/>
Innoruuk - god - He looks like Innoruuk, no other way to say it. He does a<br/>
DeathTouch every 30 seconds or so of the fight and loves to cast gravity<br/>
flux. He has a long list of drops, and most of it nice. He sees rogues and<br/>
will DeathTouch you in a heart-beat. <br/>
<br/>
Spawn Types: <br/>
Zone-Patrol - The first you will see on porting up is the zone-patrol.<br/>
Zone-patrol is about 4 roaming spawns just to make plane breaking more<br/>
difficult. They will spawn on the east wall right behind either house 5 or I<br/>
and walk the east wall S and up into the ceiling. Occasionally, one will<br/>
stop next to a house to buff the mobs inside and then cut at an angle due<br/>
SW, which could lead them into the port room itself, but they do not stay<br/>
there long. However, since they are zone-patrol, they will usually be right<br/>
beside the port room, so porting up could be a problem. Zone-patrol can be<br/>
Cleric, Spite, Ire, or Rat, and in that order of appearance. Repop on<br/>
zone-patrol is the same as static spawns if killed, so about 8 hours. If<br/>
they de-pop themselves, which they do if they make it to the zone-line, then<br/>
the repop is about 30 minutes or so, but since they walk right by the<br/>
zone-in, if you setup camp there, you will get them all. They have a less<br/>
than normal drop rate. <br/>
<br/>
Normal Roamers - There are 2 patrol routes in Hate, the North and South. The<br/>
North route is basically just as is drawn on the map, except that the mobs<br/>
will make a square just north of the Fountain (house 8) and then head back<br/>
up the path to the NW end of it. The South route follows the path but where<br/>
it stops on the south wall, the path actually continues along the south wall<br/>
until past house T, then turns due north until just past the stairs in the<br/>
NW corner of house C (beside house Q), turns east and follow N wall of house<br/>
C to house A, then N around house A and back to meet the end of the drawn<br/>
route. On both of these route, there can be Lich, Rat, or Ire. And they are<br/>
both on a 30 minute timer, so be extremely careful. Also, the route can run<br/>
clockwise or counterclockwise, and the mobs can stop mid route and head<br/>
back. They like to stop on the S wall beside houses 2, U, and T, near the NW<br/>
corner of house C, near the opening between A and C, beside house 7, 6, 5,<br/>
4, 3, and 2, and near the Totem (the black dot between house 3 and 5.<br/>
In-game, is a pillar of faces with flames in their mouths). Be extremely<br/>
careful with them when near house 2 as they could easily aggro the stuff in<br/>
house C. The door to C is beside A, so if that happens, everything between C<br/>
and the zone room will aggro. All the roamers have low drop rates, though<br/>
the Ires seem to have the pali items rather frequently. But that could just<br/>
be because there are so many of them. <br/>
<br/>
SW Corner - The SW corner is the other favorite pull spot (other than the<br/>
zone-in room). There are 3 semi-static spawns there, and they are 2 clerics<br/>
and a kirakuai. They are on a 30 minute timer and have very low drop rates.<br/>
They are here for one reason only... because it was a great pull spot away<br/>
from most of the roamer path. By being a 30 minute spawn, it makes camping<br/>
here much more difficult. I still prefer the zone-in room, even though you<br/>
have to fight with more of the roamer path. <br/>
Static Spawns - The ones in the houses are static spawns, and even they come<br/>
in two flavors. Some of the houses are huge, so they have fixed spawn points<br/>
and roamers within the houses. Static Spawns have the highest drop rates and<br/>
are on about an 8 hour timer. I will cover houses shortly. <br/>
<br/>
Boss Mobs - This is Maestro and Inny. Maestro spawns in the far NW corner of<br/>
house D in front of the organ. Inny is in a room upstairs. Maestro is on the<br/>
same static timer, while Inny is on a 7 day spawn, so usually just after a<br/>
server repop. If the server is reset, or the zone crashes, all mobs in Hate<br/>
are depopped. This is to provide a little safety during reentry. When this<br/>
happens, the timer for the entire zone starts at 0, so 30 minutes later, all<br/>
the roamers will pop, then 15 more and the SW corner will pop, then about 8<br/>
more and the statics and Maestro will pop. So, what players do is as soon as<br/>
the server drops, they head in and setup since they only have to dead with<br/>
the normal roamers and possibly the zone-patrol. They then ask for a zone<br/>
repop, which the gm will do as long as it is ONE person that asks, not<br/>
everyone in the zone.</div>
