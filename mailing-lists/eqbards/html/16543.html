 </span></blockquote>Ignorance. It didn&#39;t exist when I left Norrath and I am still getting my<br/>
bearings...I used to practice safefall through Kithicor...:o) (Unless I am<br/>
planning on being ain a given place for weeks I pretty much just stay bound<br/>
in Highpass and fade the run if I die, being a big chicken I don&#39;t die a<br/>
lot).<br/>
<br/>
Sweet...thanks everybody, that is a ton of great info. I knew I needed<br/>
reality checks on some of the prices...but yeah, Lambent does seem to be the<br/>
thing to go after for some of the pieces...and the tips on how to go about<br/>
it totally rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I see Guk, Soluseks Eye (yay! I looove that place) and fear/chain in my<br/>
future...<br/>

Screech you can make players run to zone as well, I just found them in the<br/>
library in Erudin..<br/>
