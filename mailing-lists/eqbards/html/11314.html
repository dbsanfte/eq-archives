Was talking to a few guide friends of mine in north freeport, showing them a<br/>
neat graphic bug (ok, was shoving a large spear through my head)<br/>
well, I was standing quite near a building with a bunch of paladins inside,<br/>
and I played DDD.  &quot;Rarr! I hate bards!&quot; Chaos ensued, and every paladin and<br/>
cleric in the north freeport zone started chasing me (I was only level 20 at<br/>
the time, and it didnt help that I was getting stunned. I kept picking up<br/>
more paladins and things, especially when I ran into the courtyard of the<br/>
temple of marr)<br/>
Needless to say, I did manage to zone with 5 hit points;) I still have not<br/>
lived that one down<br/>

it does modify your factions when you morph, im currently playing my troll<br/>
SK and he&#39;s kos in many places that he is not KOS as a DE. and rest assured<br/>
i&#39;ve seen plenty ppl get killed or escape by jumping off the platform cause<br/>
of morphing by accident in kelethin (my friend being one of em hehe).  dont<br/>
think my buddy was ever so shocked as to when he got jumped by everything to<br/>
the zone....  i must admit it was a nice train he had on him<br/>

&gt; I saw a Erudite banking peacefully in Felwithe, and fire off his guise<br/>
&gt; (showing off or by accident) and the pair of bankers promptly destroyed<br/>
&gt; him. I&#39;ve never seen a L50 die that fast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not sure why this happened, but I don&#39;t believe his Felwithe faction was<br/>
&gt; abnormally low. Anyone else know?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be attacked by the<br/>
&gt; guards<br/>
&gt; &gt; and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally looked upon<br/>
&gt; kindly<br/>
&gt; &gt; or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep all your<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the guise.<br/>
