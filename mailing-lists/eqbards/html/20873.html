<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201994363">I still don&#39;t understand how you have so many problems with Pickup groups?<br/>
On Saryrn we never have those problems.  Even on Veeshan I never had a<br/>
problem.  Pickup groups were nearly as good as some of our guild groups,<br/>
some were worse but none were as bad as some of the things you&#39;ve related on<br/>
this board ;)<br/>
<br/>
IMO Pickup groups are awesome because you get to learn new tactics to go<br/>
with other people who you aren&#39;t used to grouping with.  Maybe I just adapt<br/>
on the fly better.  Maybe you just have some really lousy players on your<br/>
server ;)  Dunno.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with a pickup group.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest Key in a pickup group:  Talk about who&#39;s going to do what before you<br/>
head anywhere in the dungeon.  Don&#39;t wait till AFTER you start breaking the<br/>
room to discuss who does what.<br/>

&gt; well let me explain myself then, i was assuming he was going to guk alone<br/>
&gt; considering he had invis potions, i myself hate pickup groups (remember<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; threads named Group from hell? well i&#39;ve had 2 in a row). So unless you<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; to guk with a group, hope there&#39;s someone in the tower allready so ya can<br/>
&gt; join up with them, or ya might end up like me last night, with a warrior<br/>
&gt; getting to the bridge, yelling uh oh and training all the wizards and the<br/>
&gt; gibs to the BR. needless to say i didnt make it to the zone. So ya i hope<br/>
&gt; for him that unless he has a group allready, that the ass is camped or<br/>
he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; never get it alone.<br/>

&gt; At 02:21 PM 8/8/00 -0400, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;sure he can form a group, but most chances are the place is camped,<br/>
&gt; &gt;secondly, if he just wants to go in and out, if its camped means he can<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt;there for only a couple spawns as most often the masks rot away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the room may be camped most of the time, i just disagreed immensely with<br/>
&gt; the part i quoted, i.e. &#39;&#39;first, hope that the ass/supp is camped&#39;&#39;.<br/>
