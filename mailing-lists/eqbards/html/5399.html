<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227064939">I&#39;ve died numerous times to bugs and trains, but the exp has so far been far<br/>
worth it.  A couple thoughts on your experience and possibly how mine<br/>
differs.  I haven&#39;t camped the gy, yet, tho many people have suggested it.<br/>
Only occasional Glyphed Guards con yellow to me at 24, so I&#39;m leary of too<br/>
many of them spawning at once.  I&#39;d camp it with a party with an average<br/>
level of about 25, tho.  Currently, we&#39;re camping 1 of 3 spots around the<br/>
lake.  The best spot seems to be the corner of the lake closest to the<br/>
&quot;gorge&quot;.  You can turn the corner from the gorge and be somewhat safe from<br/>
casters.  Behind the lake is safe from most trains, and I&#39;ve watched several<br/>
NASTY trains go by in safety.  You also have a good view of any gargoyles<br/>
spawning at the tower.  The 2nd best spot seems to be under the tower back<br/>
against the wall.  Tho, this spot I&#39;ve been killed by &quot;invisible&quot; casters.<br/>
They must be either in the tower or behind the walls.  This is safe from<br/>
most trains as well, and is the closest to the gargs, but you can&#39;t see the<br/>
far side of the tower.  The 3rd spot is on the hill to the left as you come<br/>
down the ramp at the entrance.  This is probably the safest spot from trains<br/>
in the front area, but is much more difficult to lure to.  Casters wreck<br/>
havoc in this zone and tying them up early is very important.  You DON&#39;T<br/>
want to tie them up out in the open as this can spell disaster if a train<br/>
comes thru.  Always lure your mob out of the &quot;tracks&quot; and snare them early.<br/>
I hit level 23 about 5 times and really missed having Chain.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention Gargoyle eyes sell for 9.5 pp?  : )<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little depressed to find out about the lute, tho I figured as much.<br/>
 : )  I guess I&#39;ll be using a heavier, overpriced high level Bard Lute, lol.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll bank it and go back to my Mandolin.  : )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m glad your experience in Mistmoore has been better than mine.  I&#39;ve gone<br/>
&gt;from 21 to 22, back to 21, gained 22, and now back to 21st level again.<br/>
&gt;These deaths have been primarily due to one or two jerks purposely causing<br/>
&gt;massive trains.  The most recent time my group was camping in the<br/>

&gt;him no because of his level.  Next thing we know the necro is leading a<br/>
&gt;train of ancilles and gargoyles into the graveyard.  As soon as he got to<br/>
&gt;the graveyard, he gated out.  They promptly killed me and one other person.<br/>
&gt;The other three were able to gate out.<br/>
