&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Hate<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well the guild im in is planning to go up to hate this week.  But this<br/>
&gt; weekend i got an invite from a friend that was allready in <br/>
&gt; hate so i figured<br/>
&gt; i&#39;d gate up early....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Friday night: was allready empty zone practically (1-2 mobs <br/>
&gt; on track) when i<br/>
&gt; got there, my friend&#39;s guild was in maestro hall, we <br/>
&gt; proceeded to pull the<br/>
&gt; area, another bard logged in (that was in his guild) she got <br/>
&gt; a helm and<br/>
&gt; martune rapier.  I have no complaints though, my group was <br/>
&gt; the xp group once<br/>
&gt; i started chanting, made almost a full bub. Got tired <br/>
&gt; afterwards, had to get<br/>
&gt; some shut eye...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Saturday morning: join up with another guild up there, 2 <br/>
&gt; other bards in<br/>
&gt; zone, one of which had a full suit, other had bp/arms/gloves. <br/>
&gt;  The one that<br/>
&gt; needed pieces went LD just before we pull a banshee, never <br/>
&gt; came back, i got<br/>
&gt; boots.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sunday morning:  join up with yet another guild up there,  <br/>
&gt; kill a couple<br/>
&gt; mobs, 2 cr&#39;s later and 2 banshees, i got myself a bp woot!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All in all i guess im a lucky bard in hate so far, even won a <br/>
&gt; lotto on a<br/>
&gt; ruby crown (money money money).  Only thing i really care to <br/>
&gt; get from the<br/>
&gt; zone now is legs and lute and maybe a diamond if i&#39;m really <br/>
&gt; lucky, and maybe<br/>
&gt; a martune rapier would be nice in offhand.  I really cant <br/>
&gt; complain, so far<br/>
&gt; with this char my hate experience has been quite positive<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wonder what i&#39;ll get this week 8)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate. I was the <br/>
&gt; only bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; all day as I recall. I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; been back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we <br/>
&gt; just went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; lend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp. <br/>
&gt; No bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
&gt; the like<br/>
&gt; &gt; since they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10 <br/>
&gt; cleric was<br/>
&gt; &gt; ganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first <br/>
&gt; was mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I <br/>
&gt; only saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I <br/>
&gt; started on<br/>
&gt; &gt; another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me <br/>
&gt; to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp <br/>
&gt; train? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any <br/>
&gt; leftover<br/>
&gt; &gt; aggro.<br/>
