is a lot of fun.  The above is true - if everyone distributes<br/>
damage well, except for the tough fights you basically have<br/>
zero downtime.  Someone goes to pull the next mob while you<br/>
top off every else&#39;s health.  The only downside is that it&#39;s<br/>
very nervewracking (for the bard at least) playing without a<br/>
primary healer.  Having a paldin with lay hands helps<br/>
tremendously in easing that fear.<br/>
