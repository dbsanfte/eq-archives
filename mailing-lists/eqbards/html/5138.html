&gt;Very strange indeed.  I may miss a note here and there, but not much.  I<br/>
&gt;have absolutely no problem getting my songs started.  Can&#39;t remember offhand<br/>
&gt;the exact number, but my dexterity is around 110 or so.  I have a feeling<br/>
&gt;dexterity plays a bigger role in getting a song up and running, rather than<br/>
&gt;charisma.  If everyone else has good dexterity and experiences this problem<br/>
&gt;I am mystified.<br/>
