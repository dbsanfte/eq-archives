I might as well speak of my weekend in Norrath as well.<br/>
Like many others, I am a harbinger of ill news.<br/>
<br/>
*Background Info*<br/>
The past week has been very busy for me. Work and other<br/>
stuff kept me from playing much the whole week. Did <br/>
have time to play an hour a day and managed to finish<br/>
the Glowing Stein quest for a friend by Thursday. <br/>
Finally, I get some time to play seriously on Saturday<br/>
and Sunday.<br/>
*End Background Info*<br/>
<br/>
Saturday<br/>
<br/>
Log on slight before noon EST. Figure it&#39;s a Saturday,<br/>
and most of my friends should be on. Do a /who all <br/>
friends and all I see is a level 23 enchanter friend<br/>
of mine (I&#39;m level 33). He&#39;s doing the Glowing Stein <br/>
quest. I&#39;m heading to Highkeep to see if I can find a<br/>
group. No luck there. Oh well. Head over to Freeport,<br/>
get a boat ride and off to Unrest. Pretty dead. Another<br/>
full group is camping the basement. Someone starts a <br/>
huge train, I run to the zone, take on the unrest noble<br/>
and his pet. With some help, I kill him and get a <br/>
bloodstained mantle. Not too bad. No group but at least<br/>
a mantle. I thank the people that help me and I&#39;m off <br/>
to Mistmoore to see if I can get a group. No luck there<br/>
either. One or two groups there, but too low to do the<br/>
graveyard. Mainly picking off initiates and grinning <br/>
gargoyles. Finally find a group with a level 31 cleric<br/>
and a 29 druid. Not willing to take chances, they want<br/>
to stay outside the graveyard. Fine with me. I stick <br/>
around helping them kill stuff that is mostly green to<br/>
me. Get one or two kills that give me exp. Ho hum <br/>
pretty boring. Get dropped. Oh well. Not exactly doing<br/>
well anyway. Decide to take a break, watch some TV and<br/>
have some food. Play Freecell a little and decide to <br/>
log on again. This time a good friend of mine, Level 35<br/>
Paladin, Talhkis is on. Meet him in the graveyard in <br/>
Mistmoore. Get a decent group going and start getting <br/>
a bit of exp. But things were going slow, so we decide<br/>
to meet another friend in West Commons and head to Sol<br/>
A. So we arrive in Sol A and head towards the King area<br/>
but we get lost some. But it&#39;s ok. We&#39;re still getting<br/>
kills and pretty decent exp so we&#39;re not complaining.<br/>
However, all this time after I left Mistmoore I&#39;ve been<br/>
having packetloss of over 50% consistently. I was <br/>
comtemplating logging and calling it a night but since<br/>
we were doing fine I decided to stay. Unfortunately, <br/>
one runner got away and came back with friends. I bit<br/>
it. There was so much packetloss when I died that I <br/>
didn&#39;t get the msg that I was slain by some goblin but <br/>
rather Pain and his twin Suffering strikes me (must be<br/>
monks. Pesty monks) but misses and I died. Bound in <br/>
Greater Fay. No problem. Level 31 cleric in my party<br/>
revives me. Decided to cut the losses before it gets<br/>
worse and log. Net experience gain for the day - Zero.<br/>
On the whole not too bad a day but far from a good one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday<br/>
<br/>
Oh how I wished I never even logged. Log on and see a <br/>
friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while. A level 29 monk<br/>
(pesty monk). Group with him a little and again help<br/>
him clear some stuff. Green to me but blue to him so I<br/>
don&#39;t really mind. Finally he gets a level 25 druid to <br/>
join us. So we try to make our way to the Foreman&#39;s<br/>
room. Packetloss is fine now so I said sure. Invis our way past most of<br/>
the goblins that were green to me. <br/>
Sitting around waiting for one more person to join us<br/>
so we can try the Captain room since we found out that<br/>
the foreman room was being camped by someone else. Just<br/>
chit chatting and all of a sudden I turn around and a<br/>
huge Flame goblin train is on my back. I run as fast as<br/>
I can but I bite it. Still bound in GFay. Ouch. This <br/>
time no cleric. Well, turns out my friend&#39;s guildmate<br/>
a level 30 druid is online and in Greater Fay. Get a <br/>
group teleport to West Commons. Invite this druid to <br/>
join us in Sol A. She does. So now we have a level 29<br/>
monk, a level 25 druid, a level 30 druid, a level 32 <br/>
warrior and me, a level 33 bard. Pretty good group. <br/>
Figure the captain room shouldn&#39;t be a problem. <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t have a problem regaining the exp I lost from <br/>
getting trained on. Well make my way back and loot my <br/>
corpse. Go back to the zone line to regroup and we pick<br/>
up another level 33 bard to complete the group. So we <br/>
try to work our way back. As I was crawling through the <br/>
hole in the wall, my computer drops a frame. Next thing<br/>
I know everything around me is red and I&#39;m taking 39 <br/>
damage every so often. Ouch, lava. Try to swim around<br/>
and find a way out. Can&#39;t, swim to a place where I know <br/>
where I am and die. Welcome back to GFay. Lvl 30 druid<br/>
comes pick me up and this time I get myself bound to<br/>
Freeport (I&#39;m too used to grouping with a level 29 and<br/>
up cleric). Run back and get my corpse with levitate <br/>
song. By this time I&#39;m kind of frustrated... but I push<br/>
on. We make our way to the captain room. Kill the <br/>
elementals (cancel their dmg shield and they are <br/>
actually pretty easy to kill and good exp). Then we <br/>
clear the other room. So far so good. Maybe all this<br/>
dying will soon pay off. Since I knew the area the best<br/>
in my group, I pull. I knew I was going to pull a big<br/>
group right when I clear the area before the captain <br/>
room. No problem. Done it a lot of times before. Have <br/>
a pull of 6 or so. I nod (and I noticed I nod more than<br/>
4 but who knows... not sure). We&#39;re working on the <br/>
flame goblin wizard. Monk says cancel magic the dmg<br/>
shield this wizard has and nuke it as fast as the group<br/>
can. Was kind of puzzled by why he told the group to do<br/>
that since the wizard dmg shield does only 2 dmg and<br/>
this wizard was hitting us with AE spells that really<br/>
don&#39;t do that much. However the fight was going well<br/>
and I got overconfident and didn&#39;t overrule that <br/>
command. So our lvl 30 druid wasted all her mana nuking<br/>
the 2 wizards and one shaman. Leaving us to deal with<br/>
one inferno and 2 flame goblins (i think). By this time<br/>
I&#39;ve taken a significant amt of damage so I take myself <br/>
out of combat for a bit and sing healing song. Two<br/>
runners go. Uh oh. I immediately order evac. Druid <br/>
doesn&#39;t have enough mana for succor. Goblins come back<br/>
with friends. I bite it first again. This time party<br/>
casualties are high. All except the monk (feigned) and<br/>
one druid die. Get corpse and decide to log. All this<br/>
time I was having a minor argument/discussion with the<br/>
other bard in the party about nod vs charm. I prefer <br/>
nod over charm, although I can see the use of charm. <br/>
However, in a party I find nod so much more useful <br/>
than charm. The other bard insist that nod is inviting<br/>
death to the person singing it (however it seems he had<br/>
no problems with me singing it and keeping other alive)<br/>
. I disagreed but oh well. On the whole totally disappointed with the<br/>
day and felt that a lot of <br/>
miscommunication led to lots of unnecessary dieing and <br/>
difficulties. Sigh...... <br/>
<br/>
That sums up my terrible EQ weekend. Taught me a valuable lesson<br/>
though, one of the most valuable thing<br/>
you can have in EQ (more than any piece of equipment in the game) is a<br/>
party of people that you can group with<br/>
and group well with (communicate and trust each other). <br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m looking forward to the next weekend and this time I hope I can<br/>
group up with all the people I usual group with. Oh, have a wedding to<br/>
attend in Norrath too. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to close things, I leave everyone with this question (which is<br/>
somewhat unfair since each song has its own merits (well almost all<br/>
songs)): <br/>
<br/>
Lullaby/Nod vs Charm in a group.<br/>
