&gt; Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters and<br/>
&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>
&gt; Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Overlapping enchanter/bard duties was a problem before and<br/>
into the 20s or so.  After that, both classes have so many<br/>
options and only a limited amount of mana/time that you can&#39;t<br/>
exercise all of them.  Once you get to your 30s, there is no<br/>
way an enchanter will be able to DoT, DD, mez, debuff, and do<br/>
attack speedups and clarity for the group.  Likewise, a bard<br/>
can&#39;t heal, buff, clarity, buff resists, do attack speedups,<br/>
and mob debuffs.  Having a bard (or second enchanter) means<br/>
one can concentrate on some of these tasks, while the other<br/>
concentrates on the rest.<br/>
