not fit to print.  this is an information source not a general gripe <br/>
board.  please let the rest of us make up out minds about people when <br/>
we meet them. i am a journalist in that other realm known as earth <br/>
and what you wrote would there be called libel.  please be civil my <br/>
brothers.  we are all here to have fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well written friend. I also hold no affilliation to said guild nor <br/>
have I met any of it&#39;s members, yet I have found their information <br/>
and input on this board to be helpfull, fair, and honorable. From <br/>
what I have read in the way of complaints against these brothers and <br/>
sisters, most are petty and malicious. Personally, if someone <br/>
&quot;slapped&quot; me I would probably question the provoking party rather <br/>
than attacking outright, but that notwithstanding the comments made <br/>
sound more like a grudge for having lost a battle that the &quot;slapper&quot; <br/>
provoked rather than an unbiased evaluation of the guild or it&#39;s <br/>
members.<br/>
