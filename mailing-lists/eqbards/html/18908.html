------------------<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ve forwarded this to the tuning and live teams and I hope to<br/>
get back to address everything in a day or two. There are a couple of<br/>
issues that I&#39;d like to pull out and comment on now though:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Angstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech (26) ┬û Fear does not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interrupt<br/>
casting.<br/>
<br/>
Fear (no matter who its cast by) has never interrupted NPCs who are<br/>
casting spells.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input. Lots of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good suggestions out there.<br/>
<br/>
This probably shouldn&#39;t be included in a list of &quot;bugs&quot;. One day we<br/>
might put one in, but we don&#39;t have anything planned for this slot at<br/>
present.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Item Switching: No other class switches items as much as bards -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>period. Bards are constantly switching between instruments because of<br/>
song requirements or increased effects. Why should the interface be<br/>
such a pain or cause carpal tunnel?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve spoken about several options including a drop confirmation, and<br/>
a /command that would make you swap out your items in specific<br/>
inventory slots. I&#39;m not sure when, or if we will something<br/>
implemented here, but it&#39;s on our whishlist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is the gem #?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys twice every<br/>
3 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Probably not. We&#39;d really like to see bards actively played, rather<br/>
than passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more<br/>
dexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a<br/>
bard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3<br/>
different melodies and change instruments at the same time is a<br/>
formidable bard indeed<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Possible, but it would be low priority.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Magical bard musical instruments give no indication of their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>effect on the player (+5% String, +20% Percussion, +10% to Brass,<br/>
etc). It would be nice to either see this info with a right click or<br/>
when using the identification song.<br/>
<br/>
The bonus varies on a per song/per instrument basis. I&#39;d doubt that<br/>
we could come up with a concise representation, and I&#39;m also not sure<br/>
that we&#39;d want to. There are other held items in the game that<br/>
increase the effectiveness of spells and do not specify by how much<br/>
in their description.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Oversight: Bards are now using mana on 2 songs, but do not get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>benefits of clarity or mana song. Why are bards the ONLY casting<br/>
class that do not get mana regeneration benefits?<br/>
<br/>
Not an oversight at all. We needed a method to place hard limits on<br/>
how well, how often, and how long a specific song could be sung. We<br/>
decided that we didn&#39;t want anything to adjust that limit. We have<br/>
offered to switch DDD to a resing timer (same as a recast timer), but<br/>
the charm song will remain on mana.<br/>
