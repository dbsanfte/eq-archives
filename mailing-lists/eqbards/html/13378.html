<b>Subject:</b> Problems last night with Lament (pre-patch) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-589504204">Last night I was in Cazic in the area that someone in my party called the<br/>
Purple Temple.  You get to it by going through the double doors in the<br/>
courtyard and following a long twisting hallway.  Halfway there you go<br/>
through a round opening called the arena.  Past the arena is another hallway<br/>
that eventually opens up to the Temple.  This is the place where the Lizard<br/>
Crusader spawns.   <br/>
<br/>
My party consisted of me, 35 paladin and 30 warrior.  We moved to the temple<br/>
invis and when we arrived there was a full spawn.  We went to the back of<br/>
the temple and set up camp there.  I told them I would pull using Lament.<br/>
In this area there are several spawns points.  Alongside the temple I<br/>
believe there are three.  Directly in front of the temple are two silvered<br/>
guard spawn points.  Directly across from the temple is the hallway leading<br/>
back to the courtyard.  There are two more spawn points (sentinels and<br/>
fanatics) at the opening of the hallway.  There are more spawn points inside<br/>
the temple.  There are also a fwe wandering mobs.  <br/>
<br/>
After we got rid of the spawns alongside the temple, I started pulling from<br/>
the front of the temple.  I equipped my lute and started up Lament.  I would<br/>
always Lament the mob furthest away from me and pull the one closest to me.<br/>
Every time there were two mobs up, the mob I successfully Lamented would<br/>
still aggro when I pulled the closest mob.  I was getting pissed off because<br/>
the song had absolutely no effect.  I ended up pulling two mobs on every<br/>
pull.  Someone in my party told me that harmony and lament type spells/songs<br/>
don&#39;t work in Cazic.  You get the message the spell/song was resisted, but<br/>
the mobs will still aggro if a nearby mob is pulled.<br/>
<br/>
The only other place I have ever had problems with Lament is in Mistmoore<br/>
between the lake and graveyard.  There are several familiar spawn points<br/>
along that path.  I have Lamented familiars closest to the lake and pulled<br/>
ones closer to the graveyard.  When they run past the Lamented mob,<br/>
sometimes the Lamented mob would follow.   I think someone on the list<br/>
theorized that while a Lamented mob won&#39;t attack you, they will go aggro if<br/>
another aggroed mob passes within their aggro radius.  <br/>
<br/>
This may have been what occured in Cazic.  The spawn points in front of the<br/>
temple are close together.  Even though the mob I pulled did not cross in<br/>
front of the Lamented mob, its possible that when I pulled it was already<br/>
within the aggro radius of the mob I Lamented.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea of why Lament didn&#39;t work like it should have?  <br/>
