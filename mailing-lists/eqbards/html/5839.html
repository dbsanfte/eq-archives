<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777594199">This &quot;feature&quot; was something I was unaware of until just a few days ago.  I<br/>
think it also helps to explain the high frequency of trains in Unrest.<br/>
Apparently some of the rooms are linked to one another.  Like the previous<br/>
poster said, the tower is linked to the barroom.  If you are in the barroom<br/>
and no one is in the tower, the mobs in the tower will come down to the<br/>
barroom when they spawn.  I believe the barroom is linked to the magi room.<br/>
I was camping the magi room last Saturday and to our surprise in walked a<br/>
noble.  What was even a bigger surprise is that one of the partymembers got<br/>
a BS tunic off of him.  <br/>
<br/>
A word of caution when camping a room in Unrest.  Using an area of effect<br/>
song like Disruptive Discord or Chords of Dissonance is not a good idea due<br/>
to the z-axis bug.  When you are camping the magi room, you will see<br/>
messages all the time stating the mortuary fungus begins to cast a spell.<br/>
You will also get hit with the Mort Drowsy spell from time to time.  In the<br/>
hand room, you will sometimes get the same message except this time its a<br/>
festering hag casting the spell.  The mort fungus is in the basement and the<br/>
hag is in the tower.  If you sing the AE songs, you will likely draw their<br/>
attention to you.  Lullaby and Largos&#39;s Binding are safe AE songs that you<br/>
can sing.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The safety of camping the house is all dependant on the on the number of<br/>
&gt; people who can hold rooms.  Never hold the bar room without some group in<br/>
&gt; the tower and watch out for trains if those two rooms aren&#39;t camped.<br/>
