<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404557820">Having gotten my 17th song recently, I can say that I put no points into my<br/>
dual wield at all, I just tried wielding a Dagger in my off hand and that<br/>
worked fine.<br/>
<br/>
The odd part was that my first improve message was to 36, so I wonder<br/>
if that&#39;s a bug, of if punching brings it up somehow, too.<br/>

&gt;like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we had to put 1<br/>
&gt;skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be wrong though<br/>
&gt;hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One final note on DW, is you need to place no skill points in<br/>
&gt; &gt; it at all for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it to go up.  You get it free at 17th level.<br/>
