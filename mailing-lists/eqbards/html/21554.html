<div id="ygrps-yiv-234093719">Lesse, what I do is find one hill giant and kite it<br/>
into another.  They&#39;re stupid and keep fighting each<br/>
other once they die which is good so it&#39;s really a<br/>
case of watching their health to make sure you don&#39;t<br/>
pick the wrong one and not get xp.  Once it dies, I<br/>
chant down the other one who&#39;s nearly dead.<br/>
<br/>
To get more technical, run close to a mob and target<br/>
it with selo&#39;s going and your drum out.  Hit it with<br/>
Siren&#39;s and turn to run incase it resists.  Restart<br/>
selo&#39;s immediatly.  Find another mob preferably of<br/>
different race and /pet attack or run up and punch it.<br/>
This will get the pet to attack.  After that, stay<br/>
away from them going in close occationally so you get<br/>
an accurate picture of their hit points.  Have selo&#39;s<br/>
going so you can outdistance to angry mobs.  If you<br/>
get a resist, do not recharm immediatly but start<br/>
weaving selos and charm till it sticks.  /pet attack I<br/>
usually don&#39;t use and favor punching it because you<br/>
really have to be right next to the pet and fairly<br/>
close to the pet&#39;s target for it to work.  It&#39;s much<br/>
better for group situations. <br/>
<br/>
The hot key bank I use for charm kiting is:  1 - /pet<br/>
attack, 2 - /pet guard me, 3 - charm, 4 - hymm of<br/>
restoration, 5 - selo&#39;s acceleration, 6 - /pet who is<br/>
your leader.  I have hot key 6 for group situations so<br/>
my group doesn&#39;t need to ask which one the pet is (A<br/>
Kobold Shaman says, &quot;My Leader is Centiera.&quot;)  After<br/>
one dies and the other is near dead, I go to my DoT<br/>
weave being 1 - chant of flame, 2 - fufill&#39;s, 3 -<br/>
selo&#39;s.  Before I got chant of flame, I would go hymm<br/>
of restoration to re-heal.<br/>
<br/>
After the patch it&#39;s still possible to charm kite in<br/>
rathe mountains just not where I was.  Hehe, had 4 HGs<br/>
and a clops after me recently cause the damage pet and<br/>
HG ran way up ontop of the mountain in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
Frontier Mountains is even better for kiting.  Just<br/>
find a digmaster (who make killer pets) and a giant,<br/>
sarnak, non-caster gobbie, gorilla and set it to work.<br/>
They will fight each other after re-charm so that&#39;s<br/>
great.  I believe I had the single chant and was able<br/>
to chant it down no problem.  The only problem with FM<br/>
was I created some pretty big trains sometimes (has a<br/>
flashback of 11, yes 11! moles running after her) so<br/>
wandering mobs can become a problem quick.  Oh, FYI,<br/>
the gorillas make the worst pets.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest dangers while charm kiting.  Lesse #1 in the<br/>
stop-start-stop bug.  Nothing says time to die with an<br/>
enraged HG following you and selo&#39;s pulses and doesn&#39;t<br/>
stay on cause of that bug.  #2 is Linkdead.  Just<br/>
accept that you&#39;re dead and come back taking your<br/>
time. You&#39;re not going to be beating 2 of anything<br/>
with your fists.  #3 would be lag.  Best advice I can<br/>
give you is if the serve lags put as much space<br/>
between you and the mob(s) as possible.  I would get<br/>
hit for obscene amounts of damage when the server<br/>
&quot;caught up.&quot;  #4 would be text warp bug.  To the right<br/>
of the zone in the OverThere, there&#39;s a spot where the<br/>
mobs warp to you.  It&#39;s not real big but whatever<br/>
you&#39;re kiting will let you know when you&#39;ve hit it :P<br/>
<br/>
The gains...  I charm kited specs and HGs from 4<br/>
bubbles in 42 to 3 bubbles into 43 solo.  In that time<br/>
I died once cause I was being arrogant (stupid me was<br/>
feeling invincible which the HGs promptly corrected). <br/>
I went from 1400 in the bank to 5700.  Nothing beats<br/>
it money wise but I was kiting them way early in the<br/>
morning 2am EST to 8am EST.  I also got through 40 in<br/>
9 hours of play time.  It is really boring though.<br/>

I am 34 right now.  Only have one chant.  I have charm<br/>
kited fairly successfully - mostly Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>
FM and Overthere.  But are you doing chanting,<br/>
charming,<br/>
both?  And as you said, the zone can only support so<br/>
many people.  If too many, lag possibly gets you,<br/>
right?  I almost died last time in the Mountains due<br/>
to lag.  I always enjoy the technical details of how<br/>
this <br/>
is done.  Please indulge me one more time(and there<br/>
are always young ones coming up who need the<br/>
information as well). <br/>
