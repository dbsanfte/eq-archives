another melee class present that could use it (assuming this were a guild<br/>
group obtaining it), I would default to them.  I would much prefer someone<br/>
else inflicting the extra hits and earning the extra tauntage than me.  I<br/>
do have a sash, but I won it on a roll with a pickup group.<br/>

For the cloak of flames and runed bolster belt, I very much doubt if I<br/>
would be alone in laughing were these to go to a bard.Not only is there an<br/>
effenciency loss since we don&#39;t get double attack, we have so many other<br/>
more interesting tools at our disposal than melee.My guild has three 50<br/>
bards, and everyone groans when we get stuck with &quot;another bard item.&quot;<br/>
(The guilds we had been doing stuff with didn&#39;t have any high level bards,<br/>
thus we ended up defaulting to the bardic items: selo drums, a mcvaxius<br/>
horn, an orb of tishan (which I agreed should be traded, nice novelty but<br/>
it went into a deal for a RBB, much more practical item), darkwood<br/>
piccalo.)<br/>

Last night in Hate was the most fun I&#39;ve had since I started pulling in<br/>
Fear.  I told the pullers to bring in multiple mobs just so I could charm<br/>
one.  I kept calling off to the guild what I had charmed (50 male rev, 51<br/>
loathing lich), once making the joke that my goal was to charm every mob<br/>
in the game (there&#39;s a ranger in guild who&#39;s goal is to snare every mob in<br/>
the game).  The enchanter in my group tried charming once; it broke in<br/>
less time than mine, and he got beat within an inch of his life for his<br/>
troubles, whereas I just ran in circles till charm restuck.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite an ego boost to hear yellow con mobs saying, &#39;My leader is<br/>
Athren.&#39;<br/>
