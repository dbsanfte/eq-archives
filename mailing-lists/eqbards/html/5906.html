&gt; No that happened to me on the test server and a couple of my friends on<br/>
&gt; other servers....it seems that if you try to zone with less than a bubble<br/>
&gt; and die during the zone the AI doesn&#39;t know what to do with you so it puts<br/>
&gt; you back at the last saved point or maybe its the safe spot for the zone....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Folks, there are three different things going on here.<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you zone with baddies whacking on you, you cannot die<br/>
while zoning - you will come through with 1 hp.  It used to be<br/>
that you could die like this while zoning, which led to a lot<br/>
of confusion (and sometimes corpses out of reach beyond the<br/>
zone line), but they fixed it by making sure you come through<br/>
with at least 1 hp.  (This still happens though if you slide<br/>
through a zone while unconcious - apparently the 1 hp check is<br/>
bypassed if you are already below 1 hp.)<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you crash or lag at the right moment while zoning, the<br/>
server loses track of you and has to restore you from the<br/>
latest backup.  This seems to be more common if monsters are<br/>
whacking on you, but then I&#39;ve only seen it happen twice. Your<br/>
hp and mana may be restored to full as some sort of safety<br/>
mechanism, I haven&#39;t seen it enough to say for sure - neither <br/>
of the persons I saw it happen to could recall if they were<br/>
already at full hp when they were last saved.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Sometimes you will zone, and will end up back in the zone<br/>
you just left (this is not bouncing off someone in the new<br/>
zone - you only zone once, but end up where you started).<br/>
Your hp are *not* restored in this case, and your new<br/>
position is right at the zone, so I think this is just a case <br/>
of failed zoning due to problems on the server.  I had the<br/>
displeasure of dying to a train due to this one.</div>
