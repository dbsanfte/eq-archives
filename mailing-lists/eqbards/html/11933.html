There are THINGS that are going to have Instant Death type of spells. Guess<br/>
what? Gods are the ones.<br/>
<br/>
Even in my tabletop type game, there are situations where we KNOW, if we<br/>
go in and mess with trying to fight something, they are so far above us, we<br/>
will be creamed on the bottom of his shoe.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a 12-year old playing at being DM either. This is a really good<br/>
GM and the<br/>
realities of the White Wolf world.<br/>
<br/>
You go up against Cain, you expect to be dead. You try to summon the spirit<br/>
of Gaia using the Rite of Summoning, she&#39;s NOT going to be happy.... You<br/>
want to fight God, expect that he is going to try and keep you from doing<br/>
so.</div>
