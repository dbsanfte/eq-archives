<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442573821">I agree with you whole heartedly John.  To those who dismiss effects like<br/>
the JBoots and SOW, I prize them greatly when I am corpse retrieving for<br/>
my party in Mistmoore.  Without SOW, I would be left at the standard run<br/>
speed which isn&#39;t useful when I am try to avoid the nasty trains started<br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
It is unfortunate that at this juncture, no major changes to the<br/>
looting system will be made.  The best suggestion that I have heard is to<br/>
simply flag items with a serial number that incorporates the item number<br/>
and user id number.  For instance the Shiny Brass Shield is item number<br/>
0200 and you are user 00000001 then the serial number for the shield would<br/>
be 020000000001.  If you ever try to loot another you will not be able to<br/>
pick it up and it will be left on the corpse.  This is by far the best<br/>
solution I have heard, no need for lore items, no need to worry about<br/>
farming and the ability to sell such items remains.  The only drawback is<br/>
what happens when someone tricks you in a trade.  BTW if there are<br/>
destroyed the item serial number is removed from the database.<br/>

&gt; When the player-to-player trade (or twink) aspect of an RPG<br/>
&gt; starts to interfere with the adventuring aspect, something is<br/>
&gt; wrong.  After playing this game, I&#39;ve decided a &quot;shows up only<br/>
&gt; a few times a day&quot; system is really stupid when a mob that&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; challenge to you is a pushover for someone else, and there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no system to enforce taking turns.  I think a better system<br/>
&gt; would be to allow each character to loot each special mob once<br/>
&gt; in a lifetime, and put lower level looting limits on the mobs<br/>
&gt; (to prevent the use of mules).  No more kill stealing for nice<br/>
&gt; items, no more harvesting to trade/sell on EBay/twink, no more<br/>
&gt; camping the same place for a week (and blocking out others) so<br/>
&gt; your entire guild can be outfitted with the rare item, and no<br/>
&gt; more having to wait 3 days for a rare mob to show up.  The<br/>
&gt; &quot;rare&quot; mob could always be there, and rarity of an item could<br/>
&gt; be determined by how frequently he drops the booby prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Believe me, as you get some of the nice continuous effect<br/>
&gt; songs like invisibility or levitation, you will wish you had a<br/>
&gt; pair of jboots.  My friends have started poking fun at me<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;ve been asking for SoW a lot lately.<br/>
