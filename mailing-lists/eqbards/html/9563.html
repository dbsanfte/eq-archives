&gt; I think you might be missing the point here. Qeynos Hills, which was the<br/>
&gt; other undead spawn area, and Kithicor (to a lesser extent, were mostly for<br/>
&gt; newbies btw 4-7 level.  So said newbie in Qeynos heads for his normal<br/>
&gt; hunting grounds and BAM, Varsoon the undying hits you for 47pts of damage.<br/>
&gt; These 4-7 level players in Qeynos have no other place to hunt. I think<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have a right to complain that they lost their hunting area.  RV residents<br/>
&gt; still have Misty Thicket so should have less to complain about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think levels 4-7 can still hunt in Qeynos Hills even with the Undead<br/>
spawn.  They may have to group more..but this is a group oriented game.<br/>
Also when I went to Qeynos Hills this past weekend..several times at<br/>
different times of the day..I never found it with less than 50 people in<br/>
zone.  Warbones and Varsoon had groups on them within a few minutes..making<br/>
it less dangerous for the lower levels.  I didn&#39;t hear any complaints from<br/>
lower level players..although there may have been some.  It seemed to me<br/>
that most people were having a good time.  Its a good sized zone..maybe they<br/>
could keep the undead north of the xroads and add a vendor south of the<br/>
xroads.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; No one is whining about dying in a fair fight.  You know when you go into<br/>
&gt; Unrest that you are taking your chances. But Q Hills? I am a level 15 Bard<br/>
&gt; and made it safely through the Hills only because I had Selo&#39;s and my drum<br/>
&gt; equipped.  Incidently, I zoned into the Hills and immediately got hit by<br/>
&gt; Varsoon, and this was at about 3 p.m. EQ time on Monday.  It was crawling<br/>
&gt; with undead, so during the day there was no respite in the Hills!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I&#39;d let you know<br/>
