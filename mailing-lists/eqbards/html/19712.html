<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] A possible way to make Disarm Traps useful? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-529153220">Actually I did play DragonRealms.  I hadn&#39;t thought of that till you<br/>
mentioned it but they did have something very similar didn&#39;t they.<br/>
Difference here is you cannot open it without the skill and it would not<br/>
poof if the trap went off.  That&#39;s how DR worked IIRC.<br/>
<br/>
It just seemed obvious to me that this could be done since the Combine<br/>
button logic already exists to transmute database items from one incarnation<br/>
into another.<br/>

Did you, perchance, at one time play DragonRealms? They did loot just this<br/>
way, only everyone got Disarm Traps skill.<br/>
<br/>
I liked it there. I&#39;d like it here, too.<br/>

&gt; I posted this idea to the gameplay boards, what do you fellow bards think<br/>
&gt; would something like this be work?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Disarm Traps, the bane of EQ programmers?<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an idea on how to make a viable use of the skill without changing<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; basic nature of the world. True it doesn&#39;t involve interaction with the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; environment, but I thought that was the problem anyhow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The idea is fairly simple. Start off by making an item called An Ornate<br/>

&gt; spell like a magic item. The spell is cast on the holder of the item and<br/>
&gt; could be a poison DoT, a lightning DD, or whatever trap you like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The change to Disarm traps would be to allow the item to make a check on<br/>
&gt; Disarm Traps when attempting to open it. If the skill check is a success<br/>
&gt; then the trapped chest is replaced with a different item that represents<br/>

&gt; This should be a feasible solution to making Disarm Traps useful, and<br/>
