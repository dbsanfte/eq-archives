&gt; According to the statistics evidenced SO FAR... I remind you this is TOTALLY<br/>
&gt; stupid to be upset over stuff that is on Test Server.  Odds are they have<br/>
&gt; those there to test how they work at that level.  Anyway, according to what<br/>
&gt; is there &quot;So Far&quot; each caster will _STILL_ be getting about 8-10 spells per<br/>
&gt; 5 levels or so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They _already_ get that.  This just staggers it out for them instead of<br/>
&gt; making them wait through 5 hell levels to get to their spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, what has changed?  They still get 10 spells every 5 levels<br/>
&gt; We still get 1 song every level<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So WHAT if it takes longer?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Class Envy &quot;They get spells every level just like we do now!  Oh my god it&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I see what&#39;s happening.  You&#39;re viewing this as a<br/>
class envy issue, so to you the fact that it takes longer<br/>
between songs is irrelevant (it&#39;s not, for the same why people<br/>
hate hell levels).  All I&#39;m saying is that in recognition of<br/>
this change from standard levels, the designers seem to have<br/>
taken steps to &quot;soften the blow&quot; for other casting classes,<br/>
but I don&#39;t forsee them doing anything for us.<br/>
<br/>
I try to appraise classes differences from a game balance<br/>
standpoint (why I calculated mana-usage-rate comparisons for a<br/>
shaman).  I don&#39;t appreciate my prediction (based on past<br/>
behavior) that bards will not be given the same amount of<br/>
consideration with the expansion being offhandedly labeled as<br/>
class envy.<br/>
