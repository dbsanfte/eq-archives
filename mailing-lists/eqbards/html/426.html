<div id="ygrps-yiv-953105960">Well I&#39;ve just joined, saw the last digest for areas near Freeport, but was <br/>
wondering what are good areas to hunt near Kelethin.  Sure Crushbone is <br/>
there but generally jerks also.  Steamfont would be great but the mino hero <br/>
has a tendency to roam around and hurt me before I can run in time.  I&#39;ve <br/>
heard of Dagnor&#39;s, but also heard it&#39;s slightly barren.  Chessboard in BB, <br/>
well, tired of wizards kill stealing while me, or my group takes all the <br/>
damage. Basically just want any information you can give, or should I think <br/>
about moving to Freeport?<br/>
