<div id="ygrps-yiv-947781641">The level 11 song (Cindi&#39;s Charismatic Carillion) is NOT BROKEN.  Here is <br/>
how you use it. Target the NPC who&#39;s faction you want to modify and con <br/>
them, then sing em the song. Here is what I have found:<br/>
<br/>
Old Faction level -&gt; New faction level<br/>
Ready to Attack -&gt; ????? (Have not tried)<br/>
Threatening  -&gt; Dubious<br/>
Dubious -&gt; Indifferent<br/>
Apprehensive -&gt; Amiable<br/>
Indifferent -&gt; Amiable<br/>
Amiable -&gt; Kindly<br/>
Kindly -&gt; ????? (Have not tried)<br/>
Warmly -&gt; ????? (Have not tried)<br/>
<br/>
The song will change the faction for ALL NPC&#39;s in the targets faction in the <br/>
zone. The effect does wear off after 10 mins or so (don&#39;t qoute me on this I <br/>
have never timed it to find exactly how long). If you zone the effect is <br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
The faction change will allow you to buy from merchants that would normally <br/>
not sell to you (Dubious -&gt; Indifferent), not be KoS&#39;d in some cases <br/>
(Threatening  -&gt; Dubious), or get quests that would normally be <br/>
unaccessable(Apprehensive -&gt; Amiable, Indifferent -&gt; Amiable, Amiable -&gt; <br/>
Kindly).  This is a wind song, so using a flute/mino horn may increase the <br/>
duration, it does not seem to increase the faction shift however.<br/>
<br/>
One other note, the song will not effect &#39;factionless&#39; creatures (ie Avaiks, <br/>
most animals). This is a great song, one of our most powerful, when used <br/>
correctly.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve checked a couple of decent sources, and they disagree on what the lvl<br/>
&gt;11 song is.  I think EQVault says it&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s broken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Could someone set me straight, please (and if you know where to find it,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;d be great, too :) )?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Secondly, even though it&#39;ll probably be months before I get to lvl 21 (I<br/>
&gt;enjoy my cleric and mage too, but bard most of all), where can I find the<br/>
&gt;higher level songs?  Are there any high level bard web sites?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
