<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438644571">That is good to know, but does killing the bandits in Greater and Lesser<br/>
Faydark affect your faction standing with the Gypsies who sell magic weapons<br/>
on Antonica?  I heard that killing the bandits on Antonica DOES lower your<br/>
faction with the Gypsies to the point that they don&#39;t sell to you and<br/>
eventually will KoS - anyone know the details here?<br/>

&gt; It is true, the only faction loss that you receive from <br/>
&gt; killing either the<br/>
&gt; bandits or the sister in Lesser Fay is a faction loss with <br/>
&gt; the Dervishes<br/>
&gt; of Northern Ro.  So kill away.  Even the bandit camp in <br/>
&gt; Greater Fay does<br/>
&gt; not yield any faction loss.  Though being a woodelf myself it is<br/>
&gt; disconcerting to receive Wood Elf bits as loot from a bandit.<br/>
