<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328947030">Answering some of my questions from yesterday&#39;s digest from what I learned<br/>
last night on SoV.  I only get the digest, so I have not seen anyone else&#39;s<br/>
responses to my questions(if there were any).<br/>
<br/>
How do you get to Velious - There is a new pirate and dock in North Ro just<br/>
south of the Barb fisherman.  Hail him and he talks of ice, adventures and<br/>
opportunity.  Ask What opportunity and he talks some more about ice and<br/>
related topics.  I am camped in North Ro now.  In reading more of the 12<br/>
days, seems like levitate might be useful going among the Icy<br/>
Fingers(islands) when you first land in Velious.<br/>
<br/>
What race - My guild on The Nameless is aligning with the dwarves.  As<br/>
people who are home early get their CD&#39;s and log on, post to the list if you<br/>
get the time how initial trip over is(and if from North Ro) and what<br/>
mobs/NPC you can walk up to without getting attacked.  Can you bind at the<br/>
docks?  And any other useful info.<br/>
<br/>
Latest patches - Sense traps and disarm traps.  My opinion is we now became<br/>
even more popular and should not lack for a group.  Unfortunately, since my<br/>
skill in these suck(never used), I hope I don&#39;t kill myself learning.  What<br/>
level do we get these(I forgot to check on my skills last night)?  Where is<br/>
a good place to practice disarm trap without getting killed?  How do you<br/>
practice/activate it - do you target the trap or is it area effect or what?<br/>
Can you do sense trap anywhere to build up its skill?  Any help on this is<br/>
much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to get my copy of SoV last night - no luck.  The EB clerk told me he<br/>
was having to fend off all the EQ addicts all day and that there was nothing<br/>
I could do to talk him into giving out a copy yesterday.  The nerve - EQ<br/>
addicts!  Well, maybe a little...  Hehe.<br/>
<br/>
See you in Velious,<br/>

Subject: Scars of Velious<br/>
<br/>
Decided to move to an upcoming topic of many future digests - SoV.  I hope<br/>
to pick up my copy today at EB in a nearby mall (preordered a while back and<br/>
if not able to talk my way into a copy today, then tomorrow).  So, my<br/>
questions:<br/>
<br/>
How do you get there?  Reading the 12 days of Velious on the main EQ site,<br/>
it seems to say Odus.  Here is the statement:  &quot;We have received recent<br/>
reports from Ak`Anon that a new continent has been discovered.  New marine<br/>
technology recently developed by the gnomes enabled the Ak`Anon Marines to<br/>
break through the Frigid Barrier to the south of Odus and in doing so, they<br/>
discovered lands previously unknown.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What race do you plan on aligning with?  I think my guild is going to<br/>
definitely align with the Coldain Dwarves by initially killing giants.<br/>
Dragons will probably be left alone, at least for a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone looked into the latest patches to see what they contain if more<br/>
than just new character models?<br/>
<br/>
Any other good information out there?  Email threads on one of the forums?<br/>
Inside info from test?  Looking forward to finding out what you know.<br/>
