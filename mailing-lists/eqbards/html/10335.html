<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213530240">Agreed.  But if Verant is hellbent on making the game harder, you would<br/>
think they would take the path of least resistance, i.e. improve the mobs<br/>
versus nerf the players.  From strictly a business perspective, this is a<br/>
no-brainer IMO.  <br/>

&gt; but it won&#39;t make a functional difference - the game will<br/>
&gt; still be more difficult.<br/>
