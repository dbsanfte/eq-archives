Bind anywhere?  Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably lucky<br/>
to have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing when<br/>
fighting uber-mobs like dragons.  &quot;Yeah, I lost a level dying 14 times while<br/>
fighting Vox, but I would just spawn, mem my spells and nuke until I got<br/>
killed.&quot;  This is precicely why Ressurection effects have been made so<br/>
horrendous.  Probably casters being able to bind anywhere was to offset how<br/>
fragile they are should the group get overrun by mobs.  The casters are the<br/>
least likely to make it to the zone alive in a bad situation.<br/>

Casters can gate, they&#39;ll always beat the melee guy to safety.<br/>
And with personal shields and mes, flux, step, etc...they are hardly fragile in<br/>
a bad situation.<br/>

Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; it&#39;s a very<br/>
important part of the game.  Many people make the &quot;game fun&quot; or the &quot;I can<br/>
only play two hours a week&quot; argument, but when you consider the impact that<br/>
binding anywhere would have on group dynamics and strategy, you quickly see<br/>
that it works best the way that it is.  Verant has decided that getting to<br/>
your corpse, in addition to the experience lost is what that penalty is.  When<br/>
there is a penalty for dying you coordinate your actions and fight with more<br/>
strategy.  Verant (and I) want this VERY much.  Conversely, if there were<br/>
little or no penalty for dying, sloppy unbalanced groups would just go into a<br/>
place like Mistmoore with little or no regard of how the zone works.  They&#39;d<br/>
just pull the castle and beat on stuff until everything was dead with the<br/>
minor annoyance of having to loot their corpses.  I wouldn&#39;t be addicted to<br/>
that game.<br/>

Umm, so running back to your corpse is part of the price you pay?  So why do<br/>
casters not have to pay this price?<br/>
