<div id="ygrps-yiv-505620596">OK,<br/>
BEFORE this gets KABONG&#39;d..and it will, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
You have hit on my PERSONAL PET PEEVE.  NOTHING annoys<br/>
my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>
zones and killing the guards there.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>
Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>
guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>
level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>
players running to them is around level 1 to 3.  <br/>
I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>
(with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>
enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>
high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>
lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>
Shada...)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>
must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>
 All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>
BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>
