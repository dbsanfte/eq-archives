<div id="ygrps-yiv-942034044">I have this weapon and use it all the time with my Ykesha. It is a bit slow<br/>
and a tad on the heavy side. It is a longsword as stated below. The location<br/>
and NPC that carries it is also correct. The proc is more of a 30DD and<br/>
14dmg for 10 rounds based on its effect when the Tesch hit me with it. :)<br/>
	Personally I think it makes for a great offhand weapon due to the proc for<br/>
two reasons. First is that, inherently, poison based effects seem to be<br/>
resisted less by mobs. Second is that one proc of this thing is equivalent<br/>
to 2 procs from a Ykeshi (asuming that my numbers are correct ) which tends<br/>
to get resisted more. I say it makes for a better offhand because the<br/>
infrequency of procs for the offhand weapon allows for the poison&#39;s full<br/>
damage potential.<br/>
	Another reason is that there are so many melee types running around with<br/>
dual Ykeshas. The Ykesha is supposed to have this unique look to it but<br/>
there are so many of them that a normal long sword is starting to look<br/>
unique now. That, and I like the many &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that in your offhand?&quot;<br/>
that I get cause of it. :)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

&gt; A new 1 hand slasher?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kicsc Der Pavz:  Damage 10, Delay 38.  +5 dex.<br/>
&gt; Effect of Strong Poison.<br/>
&gt; Wt. 8.  Magic, lore, no drop.  Classes:  B, Ro, SK,<br/>
&gt; Wr.  Found in Split Paw.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know which mob (& where located) drops this?<br/>
&gt; Anyone know if it can<br/>
&gt; be wielded in the offhand?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is from Everlore.<br/>
<br/>
This sword is dropped by Tesch Val Deval&#39;Nmak,<br/>
a level 39 or so gnoll warrior who spawns in the<br/>
old shaman lenrel/high shaman grisok spot, which<br/>
is one of the rooms behind the Verishe Mal Judges<br/>
spot. It looks like a Longsword when worn (not a<br/>
2hander as someone said before). The proc does 30<br/>
DD and then 270 or so damage in a VERY slow dot<br/>
(takes a minute or two to do all the damage).<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t determine if this weapon is wieldable in the<br/>
off hand.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>
