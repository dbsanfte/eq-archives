<br/>
Ignore #s 3, 5, 10 and 11 for the purposes of comparison, since a bard can<br/>
do those as well (and I sometimes do, although now that I&#39;ve maxed sense<br/>
heading I don&#39;t do that often)<br/>
<br/>
Combine #s 4 and 8 since they are the same action.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves 1, 2, 6, 7 and 9.<br/>
<br/>
For purposes of a a multi mob pull, let&#39;s compare.<br/>
<br/>
Bard initial round:<br/>
assist main tank.<br/>
choose different mob to charm.<br/>
start charm.<br/>
assist main tank.<br/>
stop charm.<br/>
sick pet on mob.<br/>
start song 2.<br/>
stop song 2.<br/>
start song 3.<br/>
stop song 3.<br/>
F1 twice to target pet again.<br/>
<br/>
Ranger initial round:<br/>
assist main tank.<br/>
snare.<br/>
dot.<br/>
kick.<br/>
taunt (if necessary)<br/>
root (if necessary)<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the bard is doing more work. Also keep in mind, you snare each<br/>
mob once (if you do it right) and since ranger heals are pathetic, they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be used in combat unless it&#39;s a DIRE emergency. As for dots,<br/>
ranger dots last way longer than bard songs, so you&#39;ll be dotting less as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Bard subsequent rounds:<br/>
F1 twice to target pet again.<br/>
start charm.<br/>
assist main tank.<br/>
stop charm.<br/>
sick pet on mob.<br/>
start song 2.<br/>
stop song 2.<br/>
start song 3.<br/>
stop song 3.<br/>
<br/>
Ranger subsequent rounds:<br/>
kick.<br/>
dot (not every round, but some)<br/>
taunt (if necessary)<br/>
heal (if necessary)<br/>
root (if necessary)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, bards push more buttons in a multi mob engagement.<br/>
<br/>
Single mobs are a little more even, but I think the bard still edges out<br/>
rangers since the ranger&#39;s spells have duration and do not need to be<br/>
refreshed every round of combat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, difference of opinion, so this is my last post on the subject.<br/>

Hehehe you&#39;re not listening<br/>
<br/>
In the course of a single fight my ranger does the following:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Snares EVERY mob pulled right off the bat.<br/>
2)  Fires DOTS at every mob pulled right off the bat (This has the added<br/>
bonus of keeping things from going turbo on the party bard or healer the<br/>
first time they cast).<br/>
3)  Assists the main tank<br/>
4)  Spot-Taunts things off any caster that goes too far overboard<br/>
5)  Pops tracking now and then to keep me appraised of if a named has<br/>
spawned (I notify group if one has and go get him if they say to)<br/>
6)  Spot-Heal&#39;s (39 is fun) any caster that is looking a lil low on hp<br/>
(takes some strain off the healers and builds up my taunt so the<br/>
cleric/druid/whatever can throw a big heal without getting turbo&#39;d a bit<br/>
more often)<br/>
7)  Kicks<br/>
8)  Taunts to back up tank if he&#39;s hurting<br/>
9)  Spot  - Root if a mob is driving a caster nuts and just can&#39;t be taunted<br/>
off<br/>
10) Pound sense heading every time that button comes up.<br/>
11) pop autoattack, forage, autoattack (very rapid) whenever forage recycles<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
So, as you can see, my ranger is doing a LOT more than<br/>
kick/taunt/snare/Flame lick during a fight. :)  Oh, I also nuke with<br/>
lightning (you could use your ignite spell) as needed to help burn down<br/>
casters faster.<br/>
<br/>
Between fights I give everyone who wants them Ranger buffs and if outdoors I<br/>
take care of SOW to keep the Druid&#39;s mana from dropping like a stone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a bard I tend to do the following:<br/>
<br/>
Sing 4 songs during combat (pick four, sing) (4 buttons, double punched)<br/>
Charm the occasional nasty that goes after a caster then hit &quot;N&quot; (sorry,<br/>
beta keyboard mappings) to target the nearest NPC and sic my pet on it then<br/>
I go back to singing my medly and re-charming the nasty from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
Crowd control I spin 2 or 3 songs:<br/>
Charm - sic pet on nearest nasty<br/>
&lt;insert 2 songs here (usually pixie strike on a 3rd npc)&gt;<br/>
I personally am not coordinated enough to keep 4 songs going when trying to<br/>
charm as crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
Regen/Manasong between fights<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, we push a lot of buttons but not necessarily *more*.  It all<br/>
depends on playstyle.  I know tanks, and play a tank, that never stops<br/>
punching buttons for more than 2 seconds at a time (which means I&#39;m pushing<br/>
at least as many, if not more, buttons than my bard)  My bard is far more<br/>
INTENSE action because I have to keep everything timed while doing it.  But<br/>
my ranger is definitely MORE button pushing overall.<br/>

&gt; I still disagree. I have both a ranger and a bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In combat, my ranger<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kicks<br/>
&gt; Taunts<br/>
&gt; Snares (once per mob)<br/>
&gt; Flame Licks occaisionally for additional taunt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s about it. In the 23 levels of my ranger, I&#39;ve never had trouble<br/>
&gt; chatting while fighting, and I rarely miss a beat with any of my buttons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In combat my bard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sings song 1<br/>
&gt; Sings song 2<br/>
&gt; Sings song 3<br/>
&gt; Occasisionally sings song 4<br/>
&gt; Assists several times<br/>
&gt; Launches pet when charming<br/>
&gt; Targets all over the place to keep things charmed / mezzed<br/>
&gt; Switches Instruments if doing an all song attack<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In 47 levels, I&#39;ve never been able to get out a single sentance during<br/>
&gt; combat, unless it was 3 words or less.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In terms of pure button pushing, if I push 2 buttons every 3-6 seconds,<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; adds up to WAY more than pushing 2 buttons every 6-12 seconds (taunt and<br/>
&gt; kick refresh to the best of my recollection) with an occasional extra<br/>
button<br/>
&gt; press to throw off a spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Put it to the test, count the button pushes with your ranger in an average<br/>
&gt; 60 second fight, vs those of your bard. Unless you&#39;re a 1 song wonder<br/>
(which<br/>
&gt; I doubt) I&#39;d put my money on the bard every time to have more button<br/>
pushes.<br/>

&gt; heh believe what you want.  I didn&#39;t say primary tank.  Rangers are NOT<br/>
&gt; primary tanks.  Rangers are 2ndary and as such they should ALWAYS watch<br/>
&gt; EVERYONE (including the bard) because they&#39;re the next best tank in the<br/>
&gt; group (unless there is an SK or Pally)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Snare isn&#39;t quite as easy as you think unless you just don&#39;t bother<br/>
snaring<br/>
&gt; every critter.  Its not easy to pop-target 6 mobs to make sure they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; snared then get back on the right one.  Trust me there is a LOT of button<br/>
&gt; pushing if you&#39;re a GOOD ranger, just like there is if you&#39;re a GOOD bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me and the bard I run with (when I&#39;m not playing my bard) have a blast.  I<br/>
&gt; pop-snare an entire room while they beat on me and he sings Largo&#39;s then<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; AE fear&#39;s while AE dotting I beat up one at a time and we rake in XP hand<br/>
&gt; over fist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but obviously you have a different style<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; your warrior than I do with my ranger.  As a Ranger I see it as my job to<br/>
&gt; make sure every un-engaged mob stays OFF every other party member and is<br/>
&gt; either rooted, snared or otherwise occupied so that the casters can do<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; jobs without being killed (and a bard, in this case, is considred a caster<br/>
&gt; by me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bottom line:<br/>
&gt; Bards have to time their button presses, others don&#39;t.  That does not mean<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bard is pushing more buttons.  And if your bard is pounding Sense heading<br/>
&gt; during combat then he&#39;s a fool.  The ranger CAN do it without reducing his<br/>
&gt; overall effectiveness, so he does.  In fact I&#39;ll sometimes even pop<br/>
tracking<br/>
&gt; just to see what&#39;s around.  A bard can&#39;t do that while trying to twist 3<br/>
&gt; songs because of timing.  Does that mean a bard is hitting more buttons?<br/>
&gt; Nope, just means they have to time their button presses.  I don&#39;t so I<br/>
tend<br/>
&gt; to pound buttons non-stop as a ranger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Matter of fact, I would say that when playing my ranger my fingers never<br/>
&gt; stop moving unless we&#39;re resting between fights.   Even then I&#39;m hitting<br/>
&gt; track now and then to see if a named has popped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sense Heading:  That goes for any character, not just rangers...<br/>
Perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard have a slightly higher int which would help a small amount.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Make sure you have the correct target?  What class doesn&#39;t have to do<br/>
&gt; that?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Snare:  Not exactly tough to do, when you get the snare breaks message,<br/>
&gt; cast<br/>
&gt; &gt; it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hit Kick: Yup<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Taunt: Why would you hit taunt all the time?  It only works when the<br/>
&gt; monster<br/>
&gt; &gt; is on someone else.  And again when it light up you hit it.  Very easy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep an eye on casters:  I do this more as a bard than my roomate does<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior.  Why?  because he&#39;s the tank, I want to stay on the main<br/>
monster,<br/>
&gt; &gt; let the extra mellees help the casters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No offense taken, but I can&#39;t disagree more with what you said.  My<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; &gt; char was a warrior, who is the exact same thing, minus the snare...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hit Sense heading constantly to max skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; Make sure you have correct target<br/>
&gt; &gt; Make sure target stays snared (esp painful if there&#39;s a magician in the<br/>
&gt; grou<br/>
&gt; &gt; **curses all magicians and their stupid earth pets**)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hit Kick when button recycles<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hit Taunt whenever button recycles (unless there is a warrior in the<br/>
&gt; group)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep an eye on the casters to make sure nothing jumps them.  If it does,<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; &gt; over, taunt it away and stick-root it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No offense guys.  I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>
&gt; &gt; release server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes,<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a lot of button pushing to do.  But all other hybrids have it just<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad, if not worse:<br/>
