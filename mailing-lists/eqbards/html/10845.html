Charm, doesn&#39;t wipe hate list, however, since it temporarily makes the mob your pet, it does wipe the<br/>
damage tracking that is used to determine who gets the kill.  It actually makes total sense.  Though<br/>
Verant could certainly fix it if they had a mind to.<br/>

&gt; Are you sure Sylly didnt sing Chrissons Pixie strike its a mez song, and it<br/>
&gt; would make more sense that it wiped aggressor list.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Broon was running amuck last night and scaring innocents throughout E K. I,<br/>
&gt; a 21st Song Hero, bravely ran up, got his attention, and proceeded with my<br/>
&gt; plan... (Umm, Hero Boy, this is your brain. Thanks for the emergency request<br/>
&gt; for a plan. I&#39;ll get back to you). So I ran around for awhile avoiding hits,<br/>
&gt; trying to figure out where to drag the cyclops child, when suddenly a lovely<br/>
&gt; vision in blue swept in to save the day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sylly proceeded to whack away on Baby Broon so I joined in. He cons yellow<br/>
&gt; to me now and I was surprised when my Largos and DDD actually worked! Once<br/>
&gt; he got down to a sliver, Broon paused as a glow surrounded him. Sylly says,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Finish him off, Opera&quot;. Not waiting to consider the full meaning of her<br/>
&gt; words (Brain, stop wasting your 286 processing on the plan, we&#39;re ok now), I<br/>
&gt; whacked Mono Focal a couple more times and he went down like a third-string<br/>
&gt; QB.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But I was amazed at the next line to scroll by: &quot;You gain experience!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sylly had charmed Broon and left me as the only attacker when it wore off.<br/>
&gt; I was not aware that there was a memory blur effect with charm regarding<br/>
&gt; hits taken. But seeing is believing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks, Sylly!<br/>
