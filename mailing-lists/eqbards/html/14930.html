<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425997288">Hmm I guess it&#39;s the price you pay for such dainty, delicate frames ;P.<br/>
<br/>
I have gone back to black armor to wear with the two pieces of imbrued I have<br/>
(greaves and one bracer).  I now have a black enamelled breastplate - all fixed so<br/>
that bards can wear it; there was a question for awhile.  No stats but the AC 25 is<br/>
very nice (I paid 1000 plat for it, by the way).  For those of you tired of blue it<br/>
is a nice alternative.  I am also going to do the Watchman Boots quest in North<br/>
Karana (I hear they look like black plate and they are AC5 +5 STA - much better than<br/>
blackened iron boots) and the Hero Bracer quest (for the strength) to finish off the<br/>
outfit.<br/>
<br/>
Fashion first brothers and sisters =).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, half elves can wear it just fine.  I&#39;m half-elf, and proudly wear<br/>
&gt; mine.<br/>
