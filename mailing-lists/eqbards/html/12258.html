<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361239952">Well part of grouping is not leaving until everyone is safely ressed AND<br/>
re-equipped. I&#39;m sure the cleric was feeling frustrated to, but I&#39;m not<br/>
real thrilled with how he logged before you&#39;d recovered your corpse<br/>
(which you didn&#39;t, dying in the attempt). I find a situation like you<br/>
describe the best way to find out what type of personality people have<br/>
for grouping. Regardless of what his excuse was, he took the mantle of<br/>
leadership on, so the group was his responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
A guy that is going to disband you out of the zone because he can&#39;t deal<br/>
with his frustration is going to do the same thing again. Maybe he will<br/>
gate out on a party fighting (I&#39;ve seen this one alot, I always loved<br/>
watching the excuses fly when we still managed to all survive the battle<br/>
and it was the cleric that gated) or just be the guy that loots the rare<br/>
drop (like Dwarven Workboots) and either says &quot;ring&quot; or just gates out<br/>
with the goods. Either way, your group knew it may be a tough fight when<br/>
you attempted it, so he knew the risks. I&#39;m sorry to hear you racked up<br/>
2 deaths, but you learned some very valuable information about potential<br/>
groupmates. I guarantee you aren&#39;t the only one to have problems with<br/>
him based on his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, in Unrest the bard invis song works against both Undead and living<br/>
monsters, so whether it be werebat, fastering hag, or dark terror it can<br/>
keep you safe. The only issue is, that song will &quot;blink&quot;, so if your<br/>
wind instrument skill isn&#39;t maxed, and depending on your level, it may<br/>
be quite a gamble.<br/>
