<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203712007"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; PS - I love the fix they did to mez.  I had a four person group in Seb tonight that handled 7 frogs (five<br/>
&gt; initial, two adds) with no Enchanter and no Cleric.  Mez seems to last a little longer than the normal<br/>
&gt; song, I can sing a full five during a twist, which lets me control 3-4 things with 1-2 resists.  (Lag<br/>
&gt; depending.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Ken, gott&#39;a ask. Do you find going to an overhead view helps targeting<br/>
in that situation ? I love Mez and consider it much more effective than<br/>
Charm because of it&#39;s ability to take more than 2 crits out of the<br/>
action and in addition, after hitting 51 Moonflower is finding REALLY<br/>
limited song space. She can only have space for one crowd control and<br/>
Mez is it.</div>
