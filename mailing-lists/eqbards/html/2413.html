&gt; as far as the decision to play heal or mana song, i find the same thing,<br/>

&gt; meditate combined with the mana song allows them to heal the group faster<br/>
&gt; than your healing song.  if you are in a group with no healers, you got<br/>

Everyone has to know what they are doing and be ready to stop<br/>
attacking if they&#39;re getting beat up more than the others.  A<br/>
paladin, rogue, and I did pretty well in Cazic like this,<br/>
picking off one or two (sometimes three) of the lesser mobs.  <br/>
I had my songs that could taunt, the rogue had backstab, and<br/>
the paladin was doing some nice damage with his SBH and double<br/>
attack.  We certainly had to stay more alert during combat,<br/>
monitoring each others&#39; health and backing out or taunting as<br/>
needed, but were able to do pretty well there (didn&#39;t die, got<br/>
lots of loot and experience).<br/>
<br/>
Having a healer basically lets you be a little more sloppy<br/>
with distributing damage, and take a little (or a lot) more<br/>
risk in wandering away from the zone or fighting things you<br/>
might not be able to beat.<br/>
