Its pretty awesome.  I doubt anyone below level 50 could win any of these<br/>
events anyhow.  Every event I&#39;ve been to has been completely dominated by<br/>
characters over level 40 regardless of the inappropriate nature of their<br/>
level with respect to the event.  As a result the npc&#39;s were given powers of<br/>
instant death and invulnerability.  <br/>
<br/>
They need to create a level flag for zones that prevents people over a<br/>
certain level from entering while an event is happening so that they could<br/>
actually hold events for people under 50th level.<br/>
