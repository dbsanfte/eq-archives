<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949600910">Couple of things I would like to say about the current discussion on bards<br/>
wearing plate mail.<br/>
<br/>
1)  I complement everyone on how they have conducted themselves, despite the<br/>
diametrically opposed positions.  Its a testament to this mailing list that<br/>
the responses have been well thought out and eloquently scripted.  There<br/>
don&#39;t appear to be many kewl doodz on this mailing list.  In contrast, the<br/>
EQ Vault General message board has denigrated into nothing but a continuous<br/>
flamewar for the most part.  I would even go so far as to state that there<br/>
probably aren&#39;t too many kewl doodz playing bards.  Taking a big leap here,<br/>
I would guess that a kewl dood playing a bard would have some serious<br/>
coniption fits.  He wouldn&#39;t have the ability to dish out or receive massive<br/>
amounts of damage.  He wouldn&#39;t be able to kill steal effectively.  He<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the ability to powergame as effectively as he would if he were<br/>
playing another class.  Instead, he would actually have to incorporate some<br/>
stategy and tactics into his gameplay.  This is just my stereotype of the<br/>
doodz so take it for what its worth.  <br/>
<br/>
2) I am getting absolutely no work accomplished today.  I don&#39;t subscribe to<br/>
the digest so I get these messages as soon as they are posted.  I, of<br/>
course,  have to read every one of them and soon as I get them an inevitably<br/>
that occurs right when I&#39;m in the middle of something.  <br/>
