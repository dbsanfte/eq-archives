&gt; There&#39;s still something buggy going on as well.  I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; taking faction hits in Solusek for mobs that other people pull<br/>
&gt; past my group (which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing since I<br/>
&gt; want to increase my faction with the fire giants and Solusek<br/>
&gt; mining company).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. It doesn&#39;t help I don&#39;t think. I spent many levels in Cazic killing<br/>
lizards and the first fire giant that saw me tried to squash me like a<br/>
bug. Of course many of those levels were spent there before the infamous<br/>
Cazic faction bug was fixed, so let me know if it works.<br/>
