&gt;I will have to agree on items available for bards at 20th level or so. I<br/>
&gt;would love to get rid of my Barbed Leather Whip, but to replace it with<br/>
&gt;what? If I could dual wield PGTs, that would be good, but they are still<br/>
&gt;relatively slow, heavy, and only do 6 damage. The only viable replacements<br/>
&gt;that I know of are way too expensive/hard to get. (Kilij, Crystalline <br/>
&gt;Blade,<br/>
&gt;Runed Falchion, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well like Harmonic posted already you have the benefit of being on a mature <br/>
servers.  At 20th level on a non-mature server I had a combine rapier and a <br/>
combine dagger as my main weapons.  Barbed Whips were around, but were trade <br/>
only and very rare.  FYI at 39th I just got a Runed Falchion this weekend :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The same goes for armor. I have been wearing bronze for quite awhile, and <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;is a strain for this little wood elf, but to upgrade to steel is cost<br/>
&gt;prohibitive, and lambent is way too hard for me, yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I have had basically the same equipment for months, and with nothing to<br/>
&gt;look forward to for another few months.   *sigh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again on armor at 20th I was wearing a mix of Banded, Bronze, and a few <br/>
magic pieces (spiked leather colar, etc). And I was well equiped (due to <br/>
being a merchant bard).  I was able to get full steel by 29th.  Again on a <br/>
mature server it is not uncommon to see bronze sold for as little as 1 plat <br/>
per AC.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I am overlooking something, I would love to hear about it. I would <br/>
&gt;dearly<br/>
&gt;love a quest that was long and arduous but possible for me to accomplish,<br/>
&gt;that would result in a nice weapon or magic instrument.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And speaking of instruments, if there were some better instruments around,<br/>
&gt;maybe I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on my poor melee skills so much. I would love<br/>
&gt;to sit back and play songs during melee, as I don&#39;t have the HPs to really<br/>
&gt;mix it up anymore anyway, but it&#39;s just not quite enough for me as I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to be able to weave 4 songs at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And all these balance issues, while significant, don&#39;t take into account<br/>
&gt;twinking, which is the biggest unbalancing factor, I think. Of course, with<br/>
&gt;the scarcity of attainable items and the game bias against those of us who<br/>
&gt;prefer to solo, I can see why eBay sales are so brisk.<br/>

easy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>
And the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by <br/>
added.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220 plat <br/>
on a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the Dragoon <br/>
Dirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat, <br/>
aarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though :)<br/>
