<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361783452">Did you (all of you) know that if you stamina stat is 100 or better, you can<br/>
lose every bub on the sta bar and still not have detrimental effects from<br/>
loss of stamina (ie: you dont lose speed in swinging weps.)  A warrior<br/>
friend of mine has his sta over 100 and says he would not bother with food<br/>
or drink were it not for those annoying messages.<br/>
<br/>
So for you &quot;battle bards&quot; that like to or have to melee, get your sta over<br/>
100 and forget about jig of vigor.<br/>

&gt; two... my Staff of Writhing and Kisch (*sighs*... I love my Kisch) are<br/>
&gt; nifty, but they really suck the stamina outta me in longer fights :o/ </span></blockquote></div>
