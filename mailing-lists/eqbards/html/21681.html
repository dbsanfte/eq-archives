<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171901117">Actually, Free Speech says that the government cannot prevent you from<br/>
speaking.  It has nothing to do with private enterprise or personal<br/>
communications.<br/>
<br/>
It means that the law cannot be used to stop you from voicing your<br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a common misconception that Free Speech means that in America the law<br/>
says that you must be allowed to say anything in any place.<br/>

Hopefully someone has posted this to the FAC board.  They are a group that<br/>
actively fights First Amendment Abridgements pro bono.  I can&#39;t find the<br/>
link or I would post it myself.  Obviously Verant has never heard of Larry<br/>
Flynt or they probably would have taken a different course in this case.</div>
