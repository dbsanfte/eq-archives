I have one thing to say.. roleplay.. it is what you want to make (ie. &#39;roleplay&#39;).  If you are a wizard (or a bard in this case), you would generally not wear items such as platemail as it&#39;s weight and restrictivness in movement would hinder the caster&#39;s ability; however, it doesn&#39;t mean that they couldn&#39;t equip/wear the item, it just would introduce a possibilty of penalties (ie. more difficult to cast successfully through lower dex and lower agility).  So to give my opinion, the bard should be allowed to where plate, if he / she wants.<br/>

There&#39;s my two coppers worth.<br/>
