<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240130308">Some bards swear by bronze, I myself find it much too heavy for very little<br/>
xtra AC.<br/>
<br/>
Some bards just like the looks of it.<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I&#39;ll likely be in banded until such time as I replace with<br/>
rubicite, or magical stuff.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;     For example I asked if Bronze Armor stopped more damage then banded <br/>
&gt;     over and above the AC increase. (which is very modest compared to its <br/>
&gt;     weight.)  Not one answer.  This is a relevant Bard topic because we <br/>
&gt;     can&#39;t afford to put all our extra points into Strength and the <br/>
&gt;     decision to wear Bronze plate is a tough one.  Any thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>
