&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Grats!  Great to hear everything worked out so well!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While we&#39;re on the topic of hardware...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you decide to buy an Intel P4, you&#39;re most likely gonna <br/>
&gt; be happy...if,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is, you don&#39;t mind spending more.  Historically, Intel <br/>
&gt; processors are<br/>
&gt; &gt; more expensive than AMD processors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I know before K7<br/>
AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about any problems<br/>
with k7 series though??<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Additionally, if you select Intel P4, you will be required to<br/>
&gt; &gt; also purchase<br/>
&gt; &gt; a new type of memory (RAMBUS - if my memory serves...heh).  <br/>
&gt; This memory is<br/>
&gt; &gt; much, much more expensive than the typical memory you see <br/>
&gt; advertised today<br/>
&gt; &gt; (eg: $65 for 256MB RAM).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, RAMBUS is much more expensive, however, Intel is <br/>
&gt; working with it&#39;s own<br/>
&gt; and 3rd party motherboard manufacturers to get SDRAM and DDR <br/>
&gt; SDRAM (double<br/>
&gt; data rate) mobo&#39;s working w/ P4, last I heard, expect them to <br/>
&gt; be out before<br/>
&gt; Christmas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the meanwhile NVIDA is working on their own chipset (according to toms<br/>
its a byproduct of X-box) which among other nifty things doubles the<br/>
bandwith to the memory (using DDR):<br/>

This mainboard is for the Athlon, btw..<br/>
So even if Intel makes the transition to DDRRAM they will still be hard<br/>
pressed to keep up with AMD in terms of raw performance.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; The bottom line is, do your homework before you buy <br/>
&gt; computers or computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; parts.  Pricewatch.com is an excellent source, and I have the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Google toolbar<br/>
&gt; &gt; as part of my browser.  :)  Know what you&#39;re buying, and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; your money is<br/>
&gt; &gt; being spent on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, don&#39;t forget the &quot;arcane&quot; science of overclocking.  <br/>
&gt; :)  With proper<br/>
&gt; &gt; cooling, you can get an 800Mhz processor to 1Ghz.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Both pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ <br/>
&gt; Everquest.  PIII<br/>
&gt; 600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in <br/>
&gt; old world zones,<br/>
&gt; any 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I <br/>
&gt; think it was a<br/>
&gt; 500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>
&gt; input/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything <br/>
&gt; using directx,<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah Ive dropped OC&#39;ing too. However my K7-600 Runs flawlessly at 1024x768<br/>
with a ASUS V6800 (GeForce I)<br/>
Ive had it running like 800, but it had very little visible impact on EQs<br/>
performance (My bottleneck is elsewhere).<br/>
So I pulled out some of the extensive cooling and clocked it back down hehe<br/>
- The sound from all those fans drove me crazy anyway.<br/>
My next project is to build a quiet machine..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Feel free to email me directly for directions to the best (IMHO)<br/>
&gt; &gt; overclockers info/support site on the internet.  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you try this, good luck, hopefully better than mine :)  (a <br/>
&gt; friend of mine<br/>
&gt; has a piii-7xx(?), overclocked to 1.2ghz, plays all manner of <br/>
&gt; 3d games, and<br/>
&gt; loves it, he&#39;s also running 1gb of ram...and about a dozen <br/>
&gt; fans in his case)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ugh Dosens of fans, Ill never go there again...<br/>
