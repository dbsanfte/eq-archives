<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091011694">The dex effect on melee is a simple test to do, I could do it if my<br/>
shaman friend will help.<br/>
<br/>
Get dex rings (dervishes) and the Dex buff from a Shaman (plus any other<br/>
dex stuff you can which doesnt affect anything else).<br/>
<br/>
Duel a friend 5 times with dex on 5 times with dex off, record your<br/>
logs.  See if there is any difference.  More than 5 woudl be better but<br/>
then you should see a difference if there is one...<br/>
<br/>
Repeat for agility.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
