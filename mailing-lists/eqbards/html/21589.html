<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925031147">Yes, i have seen something somewhere on this.<br/>
And it&#39;s not a so good lute.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad, i can&#39;t remember the stats, sick :(<br/>
But it&#39;s less than our lute in plane.<br/>

	I definitely agree with Sylly on this one BUT I have another<br/>
question.  Has anyone yet tested the Mystical Lute to see if there is a<br/>
significant bonus to stringed songs?<br/>
<br/>
	Just a thought......<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is what I posted to my guild re: the bard quest wep:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;&quot;If it takes 2 dragon scales to get this thing vs using those same scales<br/>
&gt; (and time and effort to obtain same) for warrior quests, I&#39;d think we&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; better off equiping our warriors with weapons that they can use as opposed<br/>
&gt; to a cute toy that a bard might equip in the off-hand when he&#39;s not using<br/>
&gt; his drum. Instruments, especially the Dragon grade ones eg: Selo&#39;s Drums,<br/>
&gt; are still the &quot;uber&quot; bard weapons for both damage as well as buffs and<br/>
&gt; resists.&quot;&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant should have made an instrument good enough so that even Shada would<br/>
&gt; use it (instead of swords &lt;g&gt;) -- now that would be &quot;Uber&quot; - truly.  The<br/>
&gt; mention of it being an &quot;off-hand weapon&quot; is from Aftathott&#39;s evaluation of<br/>
&gt; the wep and it&#39;s proc. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What good is &quot;The Vision&quot; when it makes you blind to some basic things:<br/>
&gt; Bards, songs, instruments.  Because instruments are class specific to<br/>
&gt; bards,<br/>
&gt; they should be _the_ defining items for us.  Some combination of songs and<br/>
&gt; instruments should be the focus of the bard&#39;s power and be the basis of<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; power - imho.  I guess I should be mad or dissappointed at Verant but I am<br/>
&gt; some where between &quot;numb&quot; and uninterested.  Was it said in the design<br/>
&gt; meeting: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s *make* bards compete with warriors for their quest<br/>
&gt; items - that fits with the part of the Vision where...&quot;, or was it: &quot;Shit!<br/>
&gt; Tell them to delay the update!!  We forgot to make a quest for bards -<br/>
&gt; let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; give &#39;em some kinda sword with musical notes floating around...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
