editing in my first message, sorry).  I was just at odds with<br/>
you calling it a stun.  If it were a stun, this would be my<br/>
favorite song, as I could just stun mobs and beat them to<br/>
death while they were unable to attack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re trying to interrupt casters, just Strike them over<br/>
and over.  Because they&#39;re usually dazed until the next hit,<br/>
it means they usually won&#39;t start casting until just before<br/>
the next Strike is about to kick in.  Sometimes the timing<br/>
will get out of synch (someone hits them immediately after<br/>
their eyes glaze and they immediately start to cast) and<br/>
they&#39;ll get one or two spells off, but I&#39;ve been in numerous<br/>
fights where the caster never got a single spell off because I<br/>
was continually Striking them.  In 95% of the fights I do<br/>
this, the caster gets off 2 spells or fewer.  It&#39;s so<br/>
effective that I&#39;ve been trying to decide whether I should<br/>
just drop Elemental Rhythms and rely only on Strike when<br/>
facing casters.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>
&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>
&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>
&gt; screech, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strike is much more reliable in terms of duration than<br/>
Lullaby.  When facing 2-3 mobs that are reasonably spaced out<br/>
for easy targeting, I *always* use Strike instead of Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
Charm as I mentioned doesn&#39;t let you re-charm until the mob<br/>
has become uncharmed.  That means the mob will 100% guaranteed<br/>
have a window of time in which to attack you ever 10-15 sec.<br/>
With Strike, you can Strike over and over indefinitely and<br/>
it&#39;ll never or rarely wake up.<br/>
