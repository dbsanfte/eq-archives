&gt;&gt; I hate to say this but Invis to undead is pointless.  Sonorious<br/>
&gt;&gt; Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to level.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t buy into the theory that mobs get a saving throw to detect<br/>
&gt; invisibility.  If they can see invis, they see invis.  If they can&#39;t, and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re wearing it, you&#39;re invis.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested thru the toes of<br/>
&gt; Ice Giants in Permafrost to recover a friends corpse at level 27.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With my enchanter, young kodiaks could see through my invis<br/>
right up until they turned blue.  At that level, blue young<br/>
kodiaks were indifferent, but white and yellow young kodiaks<br/>
were threatening.  It *is* modified on level, and varies from<br/>
creature to creature.  Just because it works against L40+ ice<br/>
giants doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll work against L35 greater kobolds.<br/>
<br/>
There may or may not be a saving throw aspect to it.  After<br/>
running around a lot in Mistmoore while invis, accidently<br/>
causing 3 trains, and being unable to figure out a pattern, it<br/>
finally hit me that some mobs are casting see invis on<br/>
themselves at random.  I /conned a thought spoiler as ready to<br/>
attack, while other thought spoilers were indifferent.  This<br/>
may be what&#39;s going on in the lower guk live side as well.  <br/>
I&#39;ve had a lot of invis &quot;failures&quot; there too.<br/>
<br/>
Our invis *is* both invis and invis vs. undead, but the invis<br/>
vs. undead is weaker than the spell version.  It&#39;s not enough<br/>
to hide you from some undead at certain levels, and it&#39;s not<br/>
enough to hide you from some undead at all levels.<br/>
<br/>
What I *really* want is a combo invis/see invis song.  GZ&#39;s<br/>
answer regarding this is BS.  If it&#39;s supposed to be to our<br/>
advantage that we can see the glowing balls (which give you<br/>
away in PvP), then it can&#39;t hurt to add a see invis<br/>
component.  Make it a see-only-party-invis if you have to.<br/>
