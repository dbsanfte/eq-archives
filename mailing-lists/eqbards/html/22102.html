<div id="ygrps-yiv-299940597">You know, now that I think about it.  None of my Druid&#39;s nor my enchanter&#39;s<br/>
spells stop working after a certain level, except the one&#39;s that get<br/>
specific upgrades at the same time as they become ineffective.  Why is it<br/>
that VI feels it&#39;s okay that certain bard songs stop being useful at some<br/>
point when there is no upgrade that provides the same functionality back<br/>
into our repertoire?<br/>

	ROFLMAO<br/>

	What about the &quot;make the creature really pissed at me and kick the<br/>
crap out of me instead of you song?&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quick question on the subject of Clarity.  More rhetorical than anything,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; suppose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why, oh why does every caster in creation call our most requested piece<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &quot;mana song&quot; yet they ask for Clarity by name from Enchanters?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about some professional courtesty here!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe then I won&#39;t feel so bad about mixing in the &quot;stopping you from<br/>
&gt; dying&quot;<br/>
&gt; song or the &quot;make you hit a lil bit harder, a lil bit faster&quot; song.<br/>
