&gt;there is no choice.  Also, if there is an enchanter, my slowing one mob with<br/>
&gt;Largo&#39;s is not as effective as using Chant.  Maybe it will be at some point<br/>
&gt;later, but not at 31.  The only really good thing about Psalm is it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;get resisted, so when fighting reds it can be useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, i sorta discounted chords since you said you always have an enchanter<br/>
and ae dots aren&#39;t really enchanter friendly.  again, screech is good for more than<br/>
just running.  i&#39;ve played in several groups where the ranger was good enough<br/>
that i could chains til about half health and then the ranger would drop a snare on<br/>
it at that point.</div>
