<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124527571">That was my problem as well.  A good enchanter makes many of our tactics<br/>
unusable.  I finally stuck on using hymn, warsong, and CoB after making it<br/>
clear the enchanter should not buff people with Strengthen.  When our ranger<br/>
wasn&#39;t there I used Chains in place of CoB.<br/>
<br/>
As for stacking, if CoB was up Strengthen would stick and CoB would still<br/>
work, but CoB would not stick after Strengthen.  Also, The Screaming Mace<br/>
effect will not stick if you are singing CoB, but if Screaming Mace effect<br/>
goes off first, CoB will stack on top of it.  Weird huh?<br/>

Hmmm...  This could be it, still sounds like a bug to me since it isn&#39;t<br/>
consistent.  It isn&#39;t a big deal I guess, but just leaves me with no low<br/>
level buffs that i can use when we have a good enchanter (IE one who<br/>
would rather haste the bashers then try to be 4th rate wizard)<br/>
