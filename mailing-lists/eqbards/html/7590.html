<div id="ygrps-yiv-817341758">You know reading John&#39;s post I realized its been a while since I died 4<br/>
times in an outdoor zone run in a while, but the last time it happened was<br/>
hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in Freeport.  Run out to E Commons.  Loading sure is taking an awful<br/>
long time, bad feeling about this.  <br/>
<br/>
Wake up in Freeport naked.  Hmmm, run out to E Commons but way over by the<br/>
wall.  Zone in and look to where corpse should be.  Ah, good old Ponila the<br/>
dervish sympathizer.  Great, whose bright idea was it to make her so deadly.<br/>
Sigh, Carillion her to bring her up to dubious (thank goodness I still can)<br/>
and loot corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Run across E Commons.  Run into W Commons.  Loading sure is taking an awful<br/>
long time, not again.<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in Freeport naked.  Damn!  Run out across E Commons, run into W<br/>
Commons but way over by the green mountains.  Look to where corpse should<br/>
be.  Weird, nothing there but some dark elf, DOH with a halberd!  Wait for<br/>
Dragoon Zytl to get bored and wander off (his agro range is nearly the equal<br/>
of /drag, hell might even exceed it).  Loot Corpse.  Run to Rivervale.<br/>
Hmmm, no binders, drag.  Run into Misty.  drats, no one willing to come back<br/>
into Rivervale to bind.  Oh well I&#39;m fast.<br/>
<br/>
Run thru Runnyeye.  Run thru the Gorge.  Cool this going better.  Run across<br/>
E Karana.  Hey why am I turning left, what&#39;s that brain icon.  Hell, not an<br/>
Evil Eye&#39;s pet again!!  Spend the next 20 minutes running all over the zone<br/>
killng people.  And to think I was running with shield and weapon just for<br/>
the extra +10 MR so this wouldn&#39;t happen.  Sigh.  Kill two poor melee types<br/>
who couldn&#39;t get away.  Too bad for them my Selo&#39;s is stuck on.  Sigh.<br/>
Catch and kill poor druid with SoW.  Hopefully he was bound nearby.  Uh oh,<br/>
don&#39;t make me attack that monk he&#39;ll slaughter me.  Why&#39;s he running he&#39;s<br/>
30th level?  Oh he had just killed Broon, had 20 hp&#39;s.  Sigh, too how come I<br/>
don&#39;t suck up the Evil Eye&#39;s xp like other pets.  Hey the brains gone, run<br/>
like hell to the bridge.  Loading is taking an awful long time.<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in Freeport naked.  Sigh, this is getting old.  Get /tells from 3<br/>
vitims who are petitioning me for killing them.  Sigh, &#39;newbies&#39;.  Run back<br/>
to E Karana bridge (still no luck with bind in Rivervale).  Zone in to get<br/>
corpse.  Loot corpse.  Am asked why I just stood there while Griffene<br/>
shredded me.  Sigh, &#39;newbies&#39;.  Run across N Karana.  Zone into W Karana.<br/>
Running across W Karana.  See High Elf in armor and his &#39;party&#39; approaching<br/>
me on the road.  His &#39;party&#39; immediately leaves off following him and stops<br/>
to nuke me into oblivion.  3 druid bandits a Brigand and a regular old run<br/>
o&#39; the mill.  Sigh, not again.<br/>
<br/>
This experience inspired me to write &quot;Loading, Please Wait...&quot; while<br/>
listening to Bob Seger and running back to get my corpse a 4th time,<br/>
desperately trying to stay awake.<br/>
