<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355830586">I used them last night and IIRC I got two warnings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Since this most recent patch, has anyone else (with the clickable boots) <br/>
&gt;been having levitate fade with either 1 red warning message or sometimes no <br/>
&gt;red warning messages?  I know for sure that there used to be 2 red warning <br/>
&gt;messages giving me enough time to re-click my boots, but now I can hardly if <br/>
&gt;ever react fast enough to do it and end up falling often.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt;caster character with levitate though so I can&#39;t check if its the same for <br/>
&gt;them, but for my bard this is a very annoying change =( </span></blockquote></div>
