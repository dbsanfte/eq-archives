<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970477967"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my guildmates for one of<br/>
&gt; the guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me that there was a<br/>
&gt; &quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My guild is the &quot;New Outriders&quot;. I use the /who command every time I log on<br/>
to easily find out who is on in my guild. I just type this: /who all new and<br/>
it gives me the names of all my guildmates who are not anonymous. It also<br/>
gives me anyone with the word &quot;new&quot; in their name too, but i&#39;ve noticed<br/>
there aren&#39;t a lot of characters with new in their name.<br/>
