<div id="ygrps-yiv-394108715">Segueing (a nice Bardish thing to do) from my &quot;Useless Songs&quot; thread, I actually DO mem this piece of junk<br/>
sometimes:<br/>
<br/>
1.  On guild raids, I will sing it if I have enough mana AND the leaders have explicitly called for an AE<br/>
fight AND there&#39;s no reason to think I&#39;m going to have to use Charm (OR I&#39;m expecting to die) AND I have<br/>
nothing better to fill my eight slots.  Otherwise, I would be hung by my, well, you know whats, if I had<br/>
the temerity to use AE.  This may be a little narrow-minded of my guild leaders, but I&#39;m hardly going to<br/>
argue the merits of this song in an attempt to change their minds.<br/>
<br/>
2.  When I&#39;m explicitly TRYING to aggro a primary target (VS comes to mind), the songs I use are:  This,<br/>
55 bellow and Charm.  It works pretty well, even if none of them stick, since I believe MOBs get aggro<br/>
from the potential effect, not the actual effect.  I am usually the 2nd or 3rd to aggro VS, at which point<br/>
I can slap on deftdance and keep him uselessly swinging at me while the tanks clobber him.  My guild<br/>
leaders don&#39;t know I do this, I have to sneak a rune onto me and do it behind their backs, since they are<br/>
stuck in the &quot;only riposte discipline people fight VS&quot; mode, but we&#39;ve never lost when I&#39;ve done this, so<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m provably wrong.  If someone has a BETTER 3-song aggro-the-primary-MOB songlist, I&#39;d love<br/>
to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
In most conditions, we&#39;re pulling too fast for me to take the time to mem and demem this, and keep track<br/>
of what song I don&#39;t have available in the meantime.  Nobody likes me to stop singing Cantana in downtime,<br/>
I&#39;d better have a really good reason.  And while I haven&#39;t worked out the math, I bet the net mana gain<br/>
from my singing the extra few pulses of Cantana on 3 casters can be used for comparable effect on the<br/>
MOB(s) regardless.  So why give myself the headache?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding what I would do to the song, my feeling is that, for a &quot;Desperate Dirge&quot; that is usable once<br/>
every 40 minutes at best, the effect should be pretty darned good.  Something like an AE, ultra-low-resist<br/>
12-second stun or something.  Give the party the breathing room they need to get a horrible situation<br/>
under control.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between this and Paladin LoH or SK HT is that it is much more difficult to find a situation<br/>
where the power of this song comes anywhere close to matching its theoretical power, and its theoretical<br/>
power is pretty crummy.  This isn&#39;t even taking into account the resist rate.  The Paladin will frequently<br/>
find occasions where dumping a lot of hit points into an ally (or himself) is useful.  The SK will<br/>
somewhat less frequently find occasions where knocking a large number of hit points off of a single MOB is<br/>
useful.  The Bard will almost never find an occasion where knocking a small (relatively speaking) number<br/>
of hit points off of four MOBs is useful.  If the song did X damage divided by the number of MOBs to X<br/>
MOBs, it might be cool.  Even then, it should do more damage (probably 50%-100% more), and its resist<br/>
should be lower.  SK Harm Touch resists far less often than this song does.  Further, both LoH and HT are<br/>
skills, and don&#39;t hog spell slots.  And even further than that, using LoH or HT doesn&#39;t stop the Paladin<br/>
or SK from casting, say, Stun or Darkness as much as they would like for the following 15 minutes.  It&#39;s<br/>
just feeble.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I wouldn&#39;t want ANY song to have a multi-minute timer.  55 Bellow is bad enough, having to wait<br/>
five minutes after memming a song to use it.  If I had to reduce my available songs by 12.5% by filling a<br/>
song slot that would then be grayed out for 40 minutes, the song had better be HUGELY useful.<br/>
<br/>
If you consider the fact that high-level Bards have about 30% the melee of high-level melee specialists,<br/>
then for balance, I figure that Bards should have about 70% the power of pure casters.  And given that we<br/>
can have only 3 effects active at a time, and that other casters can have easily twice that (3 static<br/>
buffs, 2 static MOB debuffs, one additional effect, for example), each individual song should be MORE<br/>
powerful than an equivalent caster spell.  Very few of ours are.  This is far from one of them.<br/>
