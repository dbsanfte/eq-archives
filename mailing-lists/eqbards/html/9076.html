<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117102809"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But what explains this?<br/>
&gt;Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just watching, &quot;An orc<br/>
&gt;oracle begins to cast a spell.  You feel drowsy.&quot;<br/>
&gt;In the middle of combat with a whole other party!  That&#39;s Bard Hate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This happens with my ranger all the time... a lot of the spellcasting mobs<br/>
will cast debuffers (cancel magic, drowsy) on you just because you&#39;re<br/>
standing within their range, even if you&#39;re not even looking at them. They<br/>
could be almost dead in a heated battle - but they&#39;ll still take the effort<br/>
to debuff someone standing nearby.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a weird thing, but that&#39;s not an example of bard hate. Happens to<br/>
everyone.<br/>
