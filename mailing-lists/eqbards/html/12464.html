I&#39;m 28 days old and only 21st level.  The problem is, leveling generally is<br/>
boring.  I get bored trying to stay in one place for long, much less at one<br/>
camp.  Whenever I see that someone stayed in the Highkeep basement for 3<br/>
levels or is Cazic for 5 levels, I get that sick feeling in the pit of my<br/>
stomach.  If that&#39;s what it takes to level beyond 25 I never will.  Doing<br/>
those things is not fun for me in the least, and if the game isn&#39;t fun I<br/>
won&#39;t play, pure and simple.<br/>

Ok, I love Everquest and have done ever since I started playing 7-8 months<br/>
ago. My problem is, I&#39;m crap at levelling, to give you an idea I think I&#39;m<br/>
31 days old and level 32. Thats almost 24 hours per level *sighs*<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of level you level 40+&#39;ers on this list so I was wondering,<br/>
how can I get a steady gain in experience? And the answer, &quot;don&#39;t die as<br/>
much&quot;, doesn&#39;t really help. I wish I could die less than I do but I&#39;m just<br/>
unlucky I guess. It&#39;s not my equipment that sucks just the rate I level at.<br/>
I have good equipment for my level, Full Lambent, Various magic items<br/>
Dwb&#39;s, Exe Hood etc and plat jewellery. Plus I have about 1.5-2k in cash in<br/>
the bank.<br/>
<br/>
I was quite pleased last night with the 2 bubs exp however I did play for<br/>
about 7-8 hours so thats crap in comparison, I have tried places like<br/>
Highkeep and it just gets dull and boring. Sol A is usually good but I<br/>
still get killed there sometimes and I end up with next to no exp made.<br/>
<br/>
Any info and advice would be greatly appreciated.....<br/>
