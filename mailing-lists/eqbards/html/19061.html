<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649279375">If the bard uses lev, you can get your group up to the exit of Kaesora, then<br/>
work your way down.<br/>
<br/>
My first trip into the dungeon was nasty.  An enchanter friend went down the<br/>
drop in the middle and got slaughtered by at least 5 spiders.  I decided to<br/>
help with CR, and thought I could lev down, any maybe avoid the spiders.  I<br/>
was wrong :(<br/>
<br/>
So a rogue came to help with CR.  We decided to lev him, and then after the<br/>
pulse, he&#39;d go hide/sneak, and I&#39;d turn off song, so he could float down.<br/>
That didn&#39;t work either.<br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;ve got 1 level 40, and 2 level 45 corpses that seem irretreivable.<br/>
We were all afraid to jump down the pit again, and we realized that with<br/>
levitate, I could get us up to the exit ramp, and then we worked our way<br/>
down (with a bigger, higher level group).  If it weren&#39;t for guild help, I&#39;m<br/>
convinced my corpse would still be there, rotting away today.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I saw you mention Kaesora in a previous post Sylly and I thought I<br/>
&gt; would give the list my experiences from there.  My guild and I have pretty<br/>
&gt; much lived there for the last 3 weeks or so.  We have went to every part<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; this dungeon and killed every mob there.  If you are in the high 30&#39;s to<br/>
&gt; low<br/>
&gt; 40&#39;s, it is an outstanding place to hunt.  For a while we were the only<br/>
&gt; groups there.  There have been a few more people showing up lately, but it<br/>
&gt; is still under utilized in my opinion.  There are several named mobs in<br/>
&gt; here<br/>
&gt; which drop some good loot for the level range.  Nearly everyone in the<br/>
&gt; guild, 21 people, have gotten a dusty ransacker&#39;s pack.  A couple of the<br/>
&gt; books, a nice 2h slashing weapon, warrior only piercer, and several of the<br/>
&gt; bard only piercers.  So the loot is very well flowing.  If you plan on<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; to the church, bring two groups, if you are in the 40&#39;s, and DO NOT use<br/>
&gt; pets.  We were there last week, very well balanced groups that included<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; necros and a shaman using pets.  Well everything went well, after I died 3<br/>
&gt; times (another long story that I shan&#39;t go into now :)) and we made our<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; down to the church.  We started pulling 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s, no problem with the<br/>
&gt; best enchanter on Veeshan IMHO, and we were going through them like candy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the fun starts.  Out of nowhere we had 7 spiders on us.  Mind you<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; are no spiders down near the church.  We kill them and finish clearing the<br/>
&gt; church.  We go in and set up camp in the basement.  We have a few pops,<br/>
&gt; kill<br/>
&gt; them, have a few more, kill them, get some roamers, etc.  Then it<br/>
&gt; happened.<br/>
&gt; A pet disappears.  A spider comes, and another, and another and so forth<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; so on.  When we finally rest, we have killed over 35 mobs in a row.  They<br/>
&gt; just kept flooding the place.  Very very scary being that far in a dungeon<br/>
&gt; with that many mobs.  We decide to head out and we go up into the church<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; the entire, I think, dungeon runs up on top of us including the named mob<br/>
&gt; Xalgoz or something like that.  Well I am the first one to die, and then<br/>
&gt; seven more guildmates die, one person went LD, and 6 more evac out.<br/>
&gt; Needless to say it wasn&#39;t pretty on the corpse recovery.  Fun was had by<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went back the next day with no pets, and we had no freaky aggro.  The<br/>
&gt; only things that aggroed us were intentional.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So in conclusion, if you are in the range of levels I stated above, grab<br/>
&gt; your guild/group/friends and head down there.  Pick up a map though,<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t get out of the dungeon the way you come in.  You go in and out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the same zone line, but you can&#39;t go up where you drop down from.  Very<br/>
&gt; cryptic, but it makes it that much more dangerous.<br/>
