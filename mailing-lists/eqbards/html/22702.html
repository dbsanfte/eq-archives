<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936485217">Yeah, when I first started playing that AE brass song in the teens (I forget the name), I got over 100<br/>
missed notes in a row.  (I started counting when I started to get irritated, and I counted 96.)  It really<br/>
annoyed the other players in High Pass, although not as much as it annoyed them when it worked.  :)  That<br/>
song ticks off everybody, not just the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, the new 49 song is a mega-taunt.  I had been kind of disappointed recently that I was<br/>
unable to come up with a way to get mobs off of clerics and stuff.  Verant did such a good job of reducing<br/>
the taunt on many of our songs that I rarely get aggro anymore.  Even the mez songs don&#39;t do it reliably.<br/>
But THIS song.  Yowzah!  I died over 10 times in Plane of Sky.<br/>
