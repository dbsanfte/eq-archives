<div id="ygrps-yiv-521988288">I just finished (re)reading _Bard_ by Morgan Llywelyn, and just loved it<br/>
(again).  I picked it up to re-read it specifically for ideas for my bard.<br/>
Though Amergin is not exactly the kind of bard that I want my character to<br/>
be, it is still a stirring novel.  The whole druid heirarchy in those days<br/>
is spelled out quite clearly in this book.<br/>
<br/>
The words Amergin sang to quell his mad brother&#39;s fierceness was very much<br/>
like a spell in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
She also has a book called _Druids_ that is very good, though probably not<br/>
much like the EQ druid class.  (It has been a while since I read it.)<br/>
