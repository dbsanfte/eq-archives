<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903122942">I try not to rant.  I really do.  I try to provide a working-man&#39;s,<br/>
non-statistical insight into being a bard when I can.<br/>
<br/>
But I give up.<br/>
<br/>
I just simply give up.<br/>
<br/>
After logging in last night and seeing that Clouding&#39;s see-invis improvement<br/>
did not work, nor did the SLN improvement, I just threw up my hands and said<br/>
&quot;Fuck it.&quot;  I have no intentions of enthusiastically reading any more<br/>
&quot;Archmage Answers&quot;, patch messages or Abashi posts regarding, well,<br/>
*anything*.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of no other professionally released piece of software used by so<br/>
many people that is regression tested as poorly as EverQuest.  As a<br/>
professional software developer myself, I find it truly staggering.  As<br/>
we&#39;ve all observed on occassion when discussing Verant, people make<br/>
mistakes, it&#39;s only natural.  But to allow so many mistakes to get through<br/>
to the customer?  I just can&#39;t get over it.  Verant does not seem to realize<br/>
the importance of their testing.  Their market is computer gamers, a<br/>
notoriously fickle crowd who have thousands of other titles to chose from on<br/>
a whim, with more hitting the shelves weekly.  Giving those customers no<br/>
reason to purchase and play another game should be their VERY HIGHEST<br/>
priority.  They seriously undermine their customer confidence when they time<br/>
and time again insist that something works a certain way and are proven<br/>
wrong, or say that something has been fixed and instantly corrected by a<br/>
huge number of their customers.  Testing Clouding&#39;s see-invis aspect is so<br/>
mind-numbingly trivial that for it not to have happened is inexcusable.<br/>
