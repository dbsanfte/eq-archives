<div id="ygrps-yiv-786821198">Ester posted on the Verant boards that this MOB is intentionally missing due to problems with one (or<br/>
some) of its quests, but will return in a near-future patch:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; For some time now, I think the patch before these two latest one, Wenglaks<br/>
&gt; (sp?) from Kael Drakkal has been missing. I know he is a part of 2 quests at<br/>
&gt; least. I think one is for receiving the Shrine key into Cobalt Scar, and the<br/>
&gt; other I believe is for the Dragon Tooth Choker. Now I want one of these (had<br/>
&gt; to take a faction hit for killing the stupid drake there). Sentry Kale gives<br/>
&gt; you a note to give to Weng, who&#39;s MIA. Giving what he gives you back must be<br/>
&gt; returned to Kale, or spawns the spy in Skyshrine in a spot at the base of<br/>
&gt; the steps that lead up to the higher levels of the shrine. What drops from<br/>
&gt; the spy is returned to Kale for the Choker, if memory serves me correctly.<br/>
&gt; OK, the question is, where in the heck is wenglaks, why has he been missing<br/>
&gt; for several patches. People can&#39;t get their shrine key without taking a<br/>
&gt; faction hit, nor can this quest be completed. Has anyone heard what&#39;s going<br/>
&gt; on, or have they moved Weng to another portion of Kael, harder to get to? As<br/>
&gt; it was the guy was relatively close to the zone, although I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
&gt; the other guys in the room would pounce on you or not. /sigh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It could be like the NoS when they moved the loot table to Howling stones<br/>
&gt; from Dalnir. They may have just made it a dropped item rather than<br/>
&gt; quested....<br/>
