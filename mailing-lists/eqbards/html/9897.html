&gt; &gt; completely.  Now find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>

&gt; &gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>
&gt; &gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I like your method better.<br/>
