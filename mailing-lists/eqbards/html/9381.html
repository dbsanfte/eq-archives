<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596686314">Thats a shame then.  I was really hoping that the patch made special<br/>
instruments give a bonus to our songs.  Guess we can hope that something<br/>
didn&#39;t go right with the patch and that Verant will fix it.  One thing I<br/>
will test the next time I get the chance is the Carillon song with a Mino<br/>
horn against a mob that is KOS to me.  With a normal flute, you can&#39;t<br/>
improve your faction high enough to get out of the KOS range (according to<br/>
this list).  Maybe with a magical Mino horn, you can now raise KOS mobs to<br/>
dubious or apprehensive.   <br/>
<br/>
Kinda wish our instruments used 1HB skill instead of hand to hand.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never used a 1HB weapon before and need to work on that skill:-)<br/>

&gt; could make our punches magical via magical gloves, but having<br/>
&gt; a non-magical instrument equipped overrode that.  So I think<br/>
&gt; they fixed it by just making all our instruments magical, then<br/>
&gt; made a big deal about it in the patch message.<br/>
