<div id="ygrps-yiv-3702545">No, because most of their servers are co-located at cerf.net&#39;s PoP (Point<br/>
of Presence) in San Diego, not at Verant&#39;s headquarters. Verant started<br/>
with a connection to UUNet back in March, and the original servers were<br/>
on their site, but when they hit their bandwidth problems they said they<br/>
moved some to cerf.net and colocated them. <br/>
<br/>
Granted, cerf.net&#39;s pop could be getting a bit full now, but in general<br/>
ISP&#39;s seem to have capacity planning under control a bit better than<br/>
Verant, at least they are a little more willing to build out before they<br/>
are completely overwhelmed. ISP&#39;s know if they build it people will<br/>
come, where Verant seems to still be in a state of denial dispite a year<br/>
of exceeding their own group estimates.<br/>

&gt; I agree totally.  I see much of the new rules as nothing more than an<br/>
&gt; official excuse for why they should not have to provide additional server<br/>
&gt; resources, and a mechanism for allowing them to more smoothly deal with the<br/>
&gt; problems arising because they have already decided not to provide additional<br/>
&gt; server resources.  Let&#39;s face it, their building may be bursting at the<br/>
&gt; seams with servers with nowhere to expand to if they underestimated the<br/>
&gt; demand.<br/>
