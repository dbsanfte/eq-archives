<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073547440">DONT!  Try to charm Tarskuk at level 28, he WILL eat you, he was red at<br/>
level 30 (which means he&#39;s outside the charm window)<br/>
<br/>
I successfully charmed him at 33, however.  He&#39;s the same level as HG&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re really close to Rathe Mountain zone. Head there and charm cyclopses<br/>
&gt; to fight other clopses or giant skeletons. If you&#39;re really good with<br/>
&gt; charm/selo&#39;s you can charm Tarskuk and have him wipe everything out for<br/>
&gt; you. But he is faster than normal clops, so you might have to zone if you<br/>
&gt; get into trouble.<br/>

&gt; &gt;         My bard is 28, and if I have to spend another day running around<br/>
&gt; &gt;chickenville in SK looking for Harriers and Avocets during primetime I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to go nuts.  I enjoy the charming in the outdoors and made it<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 27 and half way in to 28 with out a scratch on me =).  Does anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;know anything outdoors (especially static spawns) that is worth going<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; &gt;at this level using charm?  The chickens were nice because the spawns<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt;static in the village.  I know there is Choon and Froon but they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;usually camped.  Though the centuar spawns in the stables are static I<br/>
&gt; &gt;found it to be a bit risky.<br/>
