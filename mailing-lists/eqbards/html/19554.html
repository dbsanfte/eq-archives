I believe that any vendor that sells food also sells raw bamboo.  So give<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Tiny Bubbles :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, last  night i was playing Tani in the Lake and grouped with someone<br/>
whose main was a bard.... he kept requesting me to play Tiny Bubbles and i<br/>
had NO clue what he was talking about.  Later, the group explained to me<br/>
that was the water breathing song... which I wanted to play but couldn&#39;t<br/>
BECAUSE, I LOST MY Mino Horn :(...<br/>
 <br/>
So my question is, is there anywhere in Kunark to buy instruments!!??!!!<br/>
Its a sad day when a bard can&#39;t play requested songs (<br/>
