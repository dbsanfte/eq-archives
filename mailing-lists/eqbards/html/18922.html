<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660892177">The only problem I have with it is that Stratics hasn&#39;t kept up at all<br/>
on EQ, with a lot of their content and reference pages still unchanged<br/>
since beta. As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>
no downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>
away on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
Check their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>
statistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list. They have 20 songs.<br/>
I guess it&#39;s nice that they are looking for a better list now but my<br/>
question would be; why, after over a year of total neglect, are they<br/>
bothering?<br/>

&gt; They are interested in hosting the Song Analysis on their network.  I<br/>
&gt; consider the Song Analysis to be not just mine, but all of yours as well. As<br/>
&gt; it would not be what it is without the combined wisdom of all the wonderful<br/>
&gt; bards on this mailing list and on the Concert Hall message board.  Your<br/>
&gt; opinions on this matter mean a lot to me, so please let me know what your<br/>
&gt; feelings are.<br/>
