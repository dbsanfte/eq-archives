Since we&#39;ve been dealing a lot with equipment here, I had a few<br/>
questions about charisma boosts.<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m not getting into the debate on how much they help, I just want a<br/>
high charisma =)<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I&#39;m a half-elf bard (medium only) and 15th level, though I&#39;m sure I<br/>
can aquire most midlevel things if I work at it. (ugh)  Charisma stuff<br/>
usually seems pretty cheap anyways.. most don&#39;t consider it a priorty<br/>
stat raise.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I have this:<br/>
<br/>
Order of thunder (2ac, 5charisma) comes off of Drosco (a zombie necro,<br/>
around 6 to 10 I think) in Qeynos Aquaducts.  This is great for the stat<br/>
buff, bad on ac though.  Only gripe I have is that it is No Drop :(<br/>
<br/>
2 Electrum Cat&#39;s Eye Braclets (+4 charisma.. no ac IIRC).  Jewler made..<br/>
paid 10 plat for one, 6 for the other.<br/>
<br/>
My good friend Jim, A Mystic Doll (3 charisma IIRC, no ac, off hand<br/>
only)  Comes off of Lizzie Shamans in Feerott I think..<br/>
<br/>
Silk Evening Tunic (5 charisma, no ac that I recall) purchased off a<br/>
woman vender in South Qeynos<br/>
<br/>
I know jewlers can make a +3charisma necklace, but the Order is nicer if<br/>
you can deal with not being able to bank it.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, I can&#39;t wear the leatherfoot raiders cap.. small only.<br/>
Shame too, I was looking forward to the +10 :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on getting a Crude Stien (+15 charisma, and 10(I<br/>
think?)stamina, one charge of minor healing, offhand only) Found off of<br/>
Bouncer Hurd in Ferrott (around lvl 30 I believe)<br/>
<br/>
Now anything nice I&#39;m missing?  I have a feeling I&#39;m forgetting<br/>
something important, but I&#39;m not sure what it is.  With base 100<br/>
charisma, I can get to around 121 now.  Looking to beef it as high as<br/>
possible without any spells.  Any help is apretiated :).<br/>
