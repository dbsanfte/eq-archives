<div id="ygrps-yiv-543148383">OK, this is simple.<br/>
<br/>
First, lets define &quot;inventory slot&quot; so I can use the term later in the<br/>
description. An inventory is either one of the 8 basic inventory slots you<br/>
have (lower right of screen when in persona mode) OR any of the slots on<br/>
your body (wrist, head, finger, and of course weapon 1 and weapon 2, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Any &quot;inventory slot&quot; can be moved to one of the 6 hotkeys at the lower<br/>
left. Simply click and hold on the inventory slot you want to move to a<br/>
hotkey. Soon you will see an image of the entire slot appear on your mouse,<br/>
and you can exit out of persona mode and move the inventory slot to a hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
To make this effective, you will need to make 3 of your hotkeys shortcuts<br/>
to inventory slots. The first should be your right hand weapon (weapon 1),<br/>
the seoncd should be your left hand (this is where your shield, second<br/>
weapon, or instrument equip), the third should be the place in your 8 basic<br/>
slots where you keep an instrument (for instance, your drum may be in slot 1).<br/>
<br/>
Once you have copied these three to your hotkeys switching is now simple.<br/>
Click on your sword to pick it up, click on your drum to replace the drum<br/>
with the sword, click on your shield to replace your shield with your drum.<br/>
Leave the shield on your cursor. Run really really fast away from that big<br/>
hill giant, thankful you were able to switch so fast to the drum.<br/>
<br/>
You can leave things on your cursor as long as you want. You can zone, and<br/>
even log out with things on your cursor. <br/>

&gt;Hail and well met,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a 16th lvl bard on the E&#39;ci server and have a question for my<br/>
&gt;fellow bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  How do you set up a hot key to switch from <br/>
&gt;instruments to weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have tried this many times and I never seem to get it to work.  The<br/>
&gt;closest I&#39;ve come is a back pack slot in my hot key box but i still<br/>
&gt;need to go into inventory mode to grab and put away the weapon /<br/>
&gt;instrument.  Im always afraid of dropping my Combine or shiny shield<br/>
&gt;when I do this.  If any one can help it would be appreciated.  This<br/>
&gt;List Rules..=)  Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;best regards,<br/>
