<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298567932">I wouldn&#39;t say no one as druids (harmony, outdoors only but AoE), clerics <br/>
and enchanters (lull line) also get calm spells that allow them to do so.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Lament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th level.<br/>
&gt;It will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>
&gt;you just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.  It allowed me to sol <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>
&gt;there.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>
&gt;face, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;bronze spears they carried.  same deal in w karana with bandits if you are<br/>
&gt;careful.  If Lament is resisted you just flee immediately via Selo&#39;s and<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s no problem.<br/>
