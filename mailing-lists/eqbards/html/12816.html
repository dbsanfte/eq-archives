 </span></blockquote>I also fight in the first person view, as I agree with you about the<br/>
immersiveness of it; although I do use the full screen view more than the<br/>
one with all the menu options. A question, though: Are you using your hotkey<br/>
banks to switch instruments and weave songs? I find, during battle, that I<br/>
have no problem switching from weapons to instruments and weaving songs, AND<br/>
moving around, because of the fact I use the hotkey banks exclusively for<br/>
song weaving and weapons switching (which, btw... i learned how to do by<br/>
reading this list - thanks guys!). You can hotkey your melee and inventory<br/>
slots not just your songs/spells. I like the hotkeys so much so, that I have<br/>
many things hotkeyed that most people don&#39;t (all 6 of my hotkey banks are<br/>
full and I am continually rearranging depending on who is in my party, what<br/>
we&#39;re fighting AND what tactics we&#39;re using).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband is an enchanter, and quite a good one. Any of the AE songs (CoD,<br/>
DDD, Largo&#39;s, Lullaby, etc) will disturb the enchanter&#39;s mezzing, making it<br/>
hard for him to do his job during battle, which at this point is mostly<br/>
crowd control. We make it a point, when grouping, to tell people to assist<br/>
the person pulling the creatures back to where we are fighting, so he can<br/>
mez the rest, and we can dispatch them one by one. This is a much easier<br/>
tactic than trying to fight a mob or control it with my AE crowd control<br/>
songs (as they are not always effective - i.e. lullaby resists).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s ALWAYS good to have several weapons skills trained. More is better --<br/>
you never know what weapons we&#39;ll be getting in the future, and I, for one,<br/>
want to be ready to wield anything. It really doesn&#39;t take that long to<br/>
train the skills up either, especially after you get dual wield. When I&#39;m in<br/>
a group with a good tank (or two), I put the weapon with the skill I&#39;m<br/>
trying to train up in the primary hand. In my secondary hand I put the one<br/>
in which the skill is maxed. If there&#39;s no tank or I&#39;m needed to be one of<br/>
the tanks moreso, I switch it around so I&#39;m hitting with the weapon with<br/>
which I&#39;ve got the most skill. The secondary weapon skill still gets<br/>
trained, altbeit a little slower, but it does eventually raise.</div>
