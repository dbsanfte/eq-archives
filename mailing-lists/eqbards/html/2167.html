<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422481929">Don&#39;t give up on Cazic just yet. You might try pulling to the zone border<br/>
till 24th, and then you should be able to latch onto a group in the<br/>
throne room which can be less laggy though YMMV. In my experience a bard can<br/>
be a great addition to a group of people that are higher level. Currently at<br/>
26th I group with people alot of whom are 30th-32nd in the throne room.<br/>
<br/>
Also you should not be dying so much. Either your healers stink, your<br/>
tanks dont taunt, or you aren&#39;t firing up selo&#39;s soon enough. I have<br/>
survived many times to the zone in cazic with my drum on and about<br/>
half a bar of health. If in doubt, zone and live to fight again<br/>
in 2-3 minutes =)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in cazic for the last 6 levels and will probably get 27th there<br/>
tomorrow. Not to mention I got my first piece of rubicite there today<br/>
which is nice, even though it took FOREVER. (up the spawn rate on the<br/>
tae&#39;s please!).<br/>
<br/>
One other thing about cazic - if you arent healing while resting and<br/>
noone has pets, USE SONOROUS CLOUDING! I can&#39;t tell you how many times<br/>
someone has yelled TRAIN, I invised the party, and we watched the<br/>
show in peace. I&#39;ve actually finally maxed my wind skill because of<br/>
invis-ing in cazic. Sometimes if it looks hairy I will invis the<br/>
party even when I would rather heal it - you start to get the<br/>
feel of a train coming before anyone shouts it.<br/>

&gt; YUCK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I spent the day in Cazic Thule.  I loved it and hated it.  Experience<br/>
&gt; galore, but I died five times and gave most of it back.  Loot is okay,<br/>
&gt; but the market for fine steel is drowned and merchants only give me<br/>
&gt; about 6pp and 6gp for Two Handed Swords.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The data rate tends to hover between 1200 and 3000 in the Courtyard, and<br/>
&gt; the maze even got camped out later in the day so that the data rate was<br/>
&gt; still greater than 1000 in there.  That just made tough situations<br/>
&gt; worse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there any good open areas for a 23 bard to go to?  I am sort of<br/>
&gt; burnt out on indoor areas and confined spaces.  I have never been to<br/>
&gt; Mistmore.  Is that an outdoor zone?  What levels is it good for?<br/>
