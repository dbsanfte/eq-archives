<b>Subject:</b> Re: Medium Bronze Armor (Spoiler) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-120877632">Coming from a level 45 warrior here, I can say that the type of armor does<br/>
make a difference. No cold hard facts, but I did do some tests one night<br/>
when we were bored. Loaded up my packs with different armors and we hit<br/>
lower guk. We choose the Crusader as our guinea pig. For those that don&#39;t<br/>
know, he hits a lot for 120s. First, I loaded on the banded. 120s were<br/>
common place, and average hits were around 80 to 90 a pop. Shredded in short<br/>
order. Next loaded up a set of Bronze. Still a lot of 120s, but average hit<br/>
seemed around 60 to 70. Next I loaded up full crafted. Very few 120s,<br/>
average hits were in the 40s to 50s.<br/>
The one thing to keep in mind though is when you are loading up the heavier<br/>
armors, is that you are going to be sacraficing on some of the stat raising<br/>
equipment. When you get to the higher levels with your bard though, the<br/>
better armors with stat increases on them become available.<br/>
On my bard I have the following main pieces:<br/>
Mithral Breastplate<br/>
Silvery Legs<br/>
Skull Shaped Barbute<br/>
Black Charred Boots<br/>
Azure Sleeves<br/>
2 serp bracers<br/>
elf hide gloves<br/>
host of jewelry.<br/>
With this setup and my jewelry, I have an agi of 170, and a dex of 160.<br/>
Dunno if I really need those high of numbers, but I like high numbers =)   I<br/>
am able to dodge msot attacks, and when I do resort to using weapons (I<br/>
prefer using instruments), I hit a lot and proc like a demon.<br/>
While you may not see the numbers on your ac change very much with equipping<br/>
the next level of armor available to you, the difference will be noticed in<br/>
how much damage you take. And as we all know, verants uber mobs can deal out<br/>
max damage a lot, so its always in ones best interest to keep that minimized<br/>
as much as possible.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This was a topic a long time ago when we were debating if bards should wear<br/>
&gt;plate.  The theory is that stronger/thicker armor types may deflect a<br/>
&gt;portion of the blow.  For example, the random generator decides you will<br/>
&gt;take 50 points of damage from a hit.  The results would be something like<br/>
&gt;this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Type Damage<br/>
&gt;No armor 50<br/>
&gt;Leather 45<br/>
&gt;Banded 40<br/>
&gt;Bronze 35<br/>
&gt;Steel 30<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just made these up as an example.  Another theory is that the type of<br/>
&gt;armor has no impact whatsoever.  In this case, the only thing that is<br/>
&gt;important is your AC.  A higher AC would mean a less chance of getting hit.<br/>
&gt;If you do get hit, using the previous example, you would take 50 damage<br/>

&gt;I have no idea what the correct answer is but since I have enough STR to<br/>
