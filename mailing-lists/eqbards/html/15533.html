&gt; playing.... That can cause... a few problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *chuckles*<br/>
&gt; But what&#39;s really interesting is that the noises from that <br/>
&gt; program can <br/>
&gt; still be heard, despite the wolf howls and spell sounds...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lol! Yeesh, well I guess your copies are coming out good. I had problems in<br/>
the past with CD Burns when the disk was busy with other activity, but I&#39;d<br/>
assume that the equipment and software are much better nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;re stating the obvious:<br/>
<br/>
1) Make sure your power strip&#39;s switch is away from your feet. (I&#39;ve done<br/>
this a couple of times)<br/>
<br/>
2) Keep that portable heater away from your computer.<br/>
People use these to warm their feet, but the heat can cause problems with<br/>
your computer. That&#39;s why it was that little fan spinning inside of it :-).<br/>
<br/>
3) Don&#39;t attach that nice big magnet to the side of your computer.<br/>
(One of the light fixtures in the cubicles at our office, sticks underneate<br/>
the cubicle bookcase using 3 powerful magnets. Mr. Genius decides he doesn&#39;t<br/>
like the light to be under his bookcase and attaches the light to the side<br/>
of his computer, then wondered why his computer started crashing all the<br/>
time.)<br/>
<br/>
4) Don&#39;t run that happy99.exe attachment that a friend sent to you.<br/>
<br/>
5) Don&#39;t just push the power button to shut off your computer. Shut down<br/>
Windows first, and then turn off your computer. &quot;But I&#39;ve never had problems<br/>
in the past.&quot; :-P<br/>
<br/>
6) Don&#39;t use that nice little tray in your computer as a Cup Holder. (oldie<br/>
but goodie)<br/>
<br/>
7) If your mouse pointer moves the opposite direction that you are moving<br/>
your mouse, turn your mouse over (I&#39;ve honestly had to help someone with<br/>
this problem).<br/>
<br/>
8) Don&#39;t plug your computer into the power outlet that is connected to the<br/>
light switch. (I&#39;ve been guilty of this myself. Doh! I was wondering why the<br/>
power outlet was attached to the wall upside down in my new place.)<br/>
<br/>
9) Make sure kids know that the slot in the front of the computer is not for<br/>
storing Pop Tarts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
10) Plug your power strip into the wall outlet, not back into the power<br/>
strip (Yes, I&#39;ve also had to help someone with this too. Of course, had it<br/>
worked we&#39;d never have to pay for electricity again.)<br/>
<br/>
