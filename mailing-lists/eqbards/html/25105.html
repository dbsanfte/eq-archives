I know - it&#39;s freaky, don&#39;t know how it happened, but I also don&#39;t want to <br/>
take advantage of the guild, seeing as I want to join when I reach 30th <br/>
(minimum requirement for me to join).<br/>
<br/>
Is the Lute of the Howler tradeable?  I thought it was nodrop...<br/>
hrm - I see that it is not.<br/>
<br/>
How about this - request the Lute of the Howler (what&#39;s the worst he can <br/>
say? No?), and the ancient coins from Kaesora, Dalnir and City of <br/>
Mist?  I&#39;ve already got a bloodgill coin, and I see that the others are not <br/>
too hard.  That would get me two out of four really good instruments, not <br/>
bad for a young bard...<br/>
