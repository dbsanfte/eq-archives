I think he is refering to warriors and rogues.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon:<br/>
5. Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also<br/>
not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we&#39;ve<br/>
decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be<br/>
unbalancing. Bottom line: we don&#39;t feel the bonus is enough to warrant a fix<br/>
that could be interpreted as a &#39;nerf&#39;.<br/>

&gt; Lest we forget that verant has stated bards are not hybrids.....<br/>
&gt;also look at this I clipped from the post<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a balance issue we decided was also necessary to address. If we are<br/>
&gt;going to make the statement that class experience penalties should not<br/>
&gt;exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with exception to the two<br/>

&gt;How much you wanna bet that bards will be one of the &quot;as-is&quot; classes.<br/>
