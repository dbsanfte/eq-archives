<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Played a little last night. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662988571">Got my linux box setup with my cable modem late yesterday, and I<br/>
  had to test out Everquest over the link ;-)  Plus I&#39;m allowed to<br/>
  play a little bit (since I proved I could in fact not play for an<br/>
  extended time)<br/>
<br/>
  And I noticed two things. (sorry if these were pointed out before)<br/>
<br/>
  1) When fighting ice goblin casters and the ice giant diplomat<br/>
     I lost my mystic shielding or elemental icon immediately<br/>
     during any spell attack.  This probably applies to all spells<br/>
     from all NPCs, just stated what I fought for reference.<br/>
<br/>
     an ice goblin evoker casts a spell.<br/>
     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>
     Your aura fades.<br/>
     You convulse as lightning surges through your body.<br/>
     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>
     You feel an aura of _____ protection.<br/>
     an ice goblin evoker casts a spell.<br/>
     Your aura fades.<br/>
     Your skin ignites.<br/>
<br/>
     It&#39;s really ridiculous, any spell that hits me cancels the<br/>
     resist shield from the song.  It&#39;s like not playing any<br/>
     protection song at all, because everything hits for full<br/>
     since the shield drops due to the attack.<br/>
<br/>
  2) Charm has lost it&#39;s mem blur component.  This was clearly <br/>
     evident when I charmed 3 ice goblins after beating them <br/>
     down to almost no health to let a lower level player gain<br/>
     exp from them.  I got the kill all three times.<br/>
<br/>
  If someone pointed these out before, sorry to reiterate.<br/>
 <br/>
  Also, starting fresh again after all this time made me notice<br/>
  the stamina drain from the zone you originally start in, and<br/>
  that safe fall is still not activated in the zone you login to.<br/>
  I had zero stamina and took 300-400 dmg from running across<br/>
  everfrost when I logged in.  Do they simply not realize the bugs?<br/>
  <br/>
