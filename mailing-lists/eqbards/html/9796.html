&gt; So in other words, we have payed for, and are playing, an unfinished class<br/>
&gt; (Hmmm... I just figured it was a given that when you play a certain magical<br/>
&gt; class, that all spells/songs were ALREADY in the game)?  I wonder how<br/>
&gt; quickly this would have been fixed if druids or wizards had a few spells<br/>
&gt; missing (or in their case, circles of spells).<br/>

the new songs interact with some new feature(s) that will be<br/>
added to the game at large at the time of the expansion.<br/>
