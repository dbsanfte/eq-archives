<b>Subject:</b> E&#39;ci Bardic guild? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-486229091">Greetings, my experienced colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
_Rhimshot bows_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am Rhimshot, a bard of but the 17th song.  None come before me in my<br/>
family, so no generational gifts aided me in life.  I am finding it harder<br/>
and harder to defeat creatures that should be defeatable by myself.<br/>
However, I had the chance to join 2 of my fellow bards in Highhold pass and<br/>
had a wonderful time.  I would love to have the opportunity to travel with<br/>
my fellow bards again.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, I turn to you for guidance and support.  Is there a guild for bards<br/>
on the planet of E&#39;ci?  Or a good guild which is heavily populated with the<br/>
singing folk?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help,<br/>
Rhimshot<br/>
