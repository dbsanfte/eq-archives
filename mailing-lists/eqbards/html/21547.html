Nostrolo Tambourine Quest Checklist<br/>
By Windleaf Mistsong, Clan Battlehammer, Bertoxxulous<br/>
With a couple of comments by Sylly Songsynger and -=B=- taken from <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Star of Odus  Purchase for 105 pp (use your carillon) in jewel shop under <br/>
Erudin palace. Make sure you have an empty space in your main inventory. <br/>
Give Star of Odus to Wellford in Firiona Vie Bank and receive Tin Box with <br/>
6 slots. (I didn&#39;t have space and had to do this again. GM&#39;s won&#39;t help you.)<br/>
<br/>
Coins (not in any particular order). Identify each with your Cataloging <br/>
Libretto:<br/>
<br/>
1) Torsis Ton -- Foraged in Emerald Forest<br/>
      Best to have someone forage for you due to our limited forage skill<br/>
2) Royal Crown of Dalnir -- Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br/>
     It comes from the Library area, off of a Failed Crypt Raider. (-=B=-)<br/>
     Kly Imprecator either on 2nd floor (church?) or 3rd floor down back <br/>
towrds the main Kly (dining room) in the lab on the left as you go in. <br/>
(Sylly Songsynger)<br/>
3) Terraz Gon -- Failed Raider in Kaesora, behind library. Probably hardest <br/>
one to get.<br/>
     Failed Crypt Raider near the library (4 or so &#39;names&#39; rotate thru the <br/>
library spawn cycle - if you dont see him the first time - stick around for <br/>
a couple hours or so and he pops eventually.) (Sylly Songsynger)<br/>
<br/>
4) Veksar Gran -- Bloodgill Goblins in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
     Look at the base of the pillars around the center of the lake. (-=B=-)<br/>
5) Danak Gran -- Scorpoid Scrounger in The Overthere<br/>
     Go in invis and track a scrounger who is down in ravine. After you hit <br/>
him, get invis back up and lead him out of ravine (really helps to have <br/>
SOW). I accidentally brought up another scorpion, but I charmed scrounger <br/>
and had him kill it. Then fear/chained scrounger to death. They do harm <br/>
touch, but I was able to do this as a 35 bard.<br/>
6) Ik Gran -- Captain of the Guard from City of Mist<br/>
      Obtainable if you are in a group by the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Combine Tin Box and return to Wellford for Tambourine!<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
You can buy the coins from players. Just be polite and don&#39;t spam the zone <br/>
with requests. I usually would do just one request when I entered the zone <br/>
as a courtesy to others. You can frequently get the coins for free if you <br/>
are polite. However, for the Kaesora coin, I was gladly offering to pay <br/>
50pp as hardly anyone was ever in Kaesora on Bertox server, and when there <br/>
were people in Kaesora, a lot of times it was people from a Japanese <br/>
guild.  On other servers with lots of Kaesora hunters, you should get this <br/>
easily). ---Windleaf<br/>

&gt;Thanks for the response on my charm/chant questions.  Though I asked Cent<br/>
&gt;directly, I always look forward to good responses and yours is definitely<br/>
&gt;that =).  You mention the Nostrolo Tambourine.  I did some web searching and<br/>
&gt;could not actually find the quest.  Unfortunately, Allakhazam&#39;s is blocked<br/>
&gt;here.  Can you fill me in on the whole quest?  You need to get a gem in<br/>
&gt;Erudin, turn it in to one of the bankers in FV, get the coins from various<br/>
&gt;Kunark zones(I have two - Dalnirs and I think Kaesora - guildmate actually<br/>
&gt;has it), put them in the container, then...  I thank you in advance.<br/>

&gt;Original Message:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know you addressed this to Centiera, but I feel comfortable throwing in<br/>
&gt;my 2 cents since I&#39;ve been doing the same things. Also, I cut off Cent&#39;s<br/>
&gt;message as it was easier for me to answer your paragraph with one of my own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In Rathe Mtns if you get too many people, you can&#39;t charm kite. You require<br/>
&gt;at least 2 hill giants to charm kite efficiently. If the whole zone is full<br/>
&gt;of hill giants, a bard can spend all day with no downtime. The surviving<br/>
&gt;hill giant of each fight is killed by a new healthy hill giant that you<br/>
&gt;charm, you keep doing that and make lots of money and exp. But even on<br/>
&gt;Bertox, where there might only be 20 people in the zone, they&#39;re all doing<br/>
&gt;hill giants. There&#39;s also high level solo druids, necros and wizzies just<br/>
&gt;working for money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I do hunt in Rathe Mtns, I will have my pet hill giant kill lizards,<br/>
&gt;cyclopses, giant skeletons, and even basilisks who are sitting on top of a<br/>
&gt;hill giant spawn point so that I will have plenty of hill giants spawn. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;not exactly sure which mobs are the PH&#39;s for the giants, so I do them all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only time I ever chant a hill giant (or spectre for that matter) is if<br/>
&gt;there are no other hill giants to charm. I just run big circles weaving my<br/>
&gt;2 chants and accelerando. Of course, the Nostrolo Tambourine is a huge help<br/>
&gt;if you are kiting with the chants and can be gotten with a little bit of<br/>
&gt;work for any level 35 bard, depending on the server you&#39;re on. For me, the<br/>
&gt;Kaesora coin was the hardest to get, but I just poked my head in there<br/>
&gt;every now and then and finally found someone to give me a coin. If I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;doing this type of &quot;begging&quot;, I make sure I&#39;m always extremely polite, only<br/>
&gt;send one zone wide request, and always apologize for bothering anyone who&#39;s<br/>
&gt;playing, &#39;cuz I know I refuse to help anyone who spams the zone repeatedly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, at level 39 I found that I can effectively kite in the Dreadlands,<br/>
&gt;even though I&#39;ve been told by a couple of bards (level 45 and level 60)<br/>
&gt;that it&#39;s probably too hard for me. Just had to try it. I was just going to<br/>
&gt;kite a Mtn Giant Craig near the Burning Woods zone with the chants, but I<br/>
&gt;aggro&#39;d a spider, running him over accidentally. Even though the Craig was<br/>
&gt;at half life, I charmed him and he dispatched the spider for me. Finished<br/>
&gt;my faithful pet off with chants. I didn&#39;t do anymore since I needed to camp<br/>
&gt;for the night, but I&#39;ll give it a go again soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, in case you try, the giants in Frontier Mtns do not seem to remember<br/>
&gt;the last command you sent to them if you are having them kill each other.<br/>
&gt;You have to give your pet the command to attack again. Very annoying. Same<br/>
&gt;goes if you charm a giant skel in Rathe Mtns to kill another giant skel.<br/>
