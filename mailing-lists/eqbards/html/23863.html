<div id="ygrps-yiv-318163031">Heiro&#39;s are only 30-35k, and as Jeff said they are better than the white<br/>
dragonscale.  but, what is important for Gore is levels, MR/CR, lots of<br/>
people, and lots of wizards to nuke and enchanters to sieve.  just treat her<br/>
like a buffed-up Vox.  while tons of melee own all the other mobs, casters<br/>
own Gore cause of her AE Slow breath.  we have a lot harder time with Gore<br/>
(which we don&#39;t ever bother with really) than we do a lot of easier mobs<br/>
cause our guild is mostly melee.<br/>
