<div id="ygrps-yiv-982550728">Yes! I just completed the Squad ring quest in Rivervale last night using<br/>
this song:<br/>
<br/>
Target Marshall Ghoober. Say, &quot;Am I one with the Wall?&quot;<br/>
He says &quot;You are in good standing... blah blah blah&quot;. No ring.<br/>
Sing Carrilon. An Aura of enchantment surrounds me. Say, &quot;Am I one with the<br/>
Wall?&quot;<br/>
He says, &quot;Yes! You are now part of an elite group... blah blah blah.&quot; I get<br/>
the ring!<br/>
<br/>
I lost count of how many gobbies and orcs I killed, and how many belts and<br/>
beads I turned in, so I can&#39;t say how close I was without the song. Pretty<br/>
close, I think. But the song saved me from another round of slaying, at<br/>
least.<br/>
<br/>
Now if I only remembered to use the ring when Dragoon Lyst (sp) took a<br/>
dislike to me in W Commons. :p<br/>

&gt; Uses for combat?  I don&#39;t think it will work.  It would be similar to<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; invis while in the middle of combat, and that sure as heck don&#39;t work.<br/>
This<br/>
&gt; song has great longterm benefits in the fact that you&#39;ll get better prices<br/>
&gt; from NPC vendors when buying and selling.  It also allows you to start /<br/>
&gt; finish quests that would normally require a lot grunt work to get to the<br/>
&gt; appropriate faction.<br/>

&gt; Played with my new Level 11 spell today.  Its a nice faction modifier,<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; seen mysefl go from inddiferent to amiable and from apprehensive to<br/>
&gt; indifferent.  Aside from using it to move past the occasional hostile mob,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was wondering if it had any use in actul combat?  Thanks for any insight.<br/>
