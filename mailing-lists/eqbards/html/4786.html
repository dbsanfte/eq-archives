 </span></blockquote>	Lullaby does interrupt casters, but there are two things that make<br/>
this confusing.<br/>
	One is that every nod message does not mean the mob is sleeping<br/>
(don&#39;t ask me why).<br/>
	The other is that _when_ you cause them to nod is also a factor in<br/>
determining whether the <br/>
	spell is interrupted (but that is just my opinion, because given the<br/>
first reason, it is not <br/>
	truly possible to prove the second).  The reason why I believe the<br/>
second reason to be <br/>
	true is that, I have failed to interrupt spells despite cycling<br/>
Lullaby as fast as possible, <br/>
	then I decided to pause for approximately one-half cycle to offset<br/>
the timing, and resumed <br/>
	cycling lullaby as fast as possible and noticed that I was<br/>
interrupting the spells.  No, I do <br/>
	not have 10,000 data points to validate my assumption, but over the<br/>
course of about 10 <br/>
	levels of using Lullaby in Cazic Thule (22 through 32), it does seem<br/>
that <br/>
	timing matters.  <br/>
