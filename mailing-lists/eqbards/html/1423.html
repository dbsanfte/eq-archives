<b>Subject:</b> Re: Using the Lament song + a minor rant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290200458">Recently I&#39;ve been using the &quot;Jig&quot; (level 2 song I believe) to help mana<br/>
regrowth. I&#39;m not sure of the exact ammount (I&#39;ve heard 10%) but the<br/>
spell casters who group with me tell me that it does increase their rate<br/>
of regrowth, especially with my drum. So my theory is, it can&#39;t hurt<br/>
them with medding, they think it makes them med faster, they like me<br/>
more. Its all for the best.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve become Luini the Mini Mana Bard, *smirks*. Not too bad I think.<br/>
