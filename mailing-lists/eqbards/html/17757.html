<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972257472">I&#39;m getting some great ideas guys! Thanks so much! Yep Tyunes, that&#39;s the<br/>
idea...losing is something I sort of expect with him being the level he is,<br/>
but I want to at least put a hurtin&#39; on him! I will have to check to make sure<br/>
I can leave the board, that would be soooo funny! Everyone would be like where<br/>
did she go? And I do have a friend I can borrow claws from :-)<br/>

&gt; remember, running like the gingerbread man is what we<br/>
&gt; do best;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a goblin Camp North of the chessboard.  A<br/>
&gt; 15th lvl pet will kill them in no time but they should<br/>
&gt; keep the pet occupied long enough for you to go back<br/>
&gt; and melee the mage a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...and borrow a thulian claw or something really fast<br/>
&gt; from the genius who matched you up with a con-red<br/>
&gt; opponent. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also work overtime to make 12th lvl, which you can<br/>
&gt; easily do at the chessboard, but a quick place is the<br/>
&gt; Derv Camp in West Commons...you might even make 13 by<br/>
&gt; then.  You are still at a disadvantage but at least<br/>
&gt; you would have bellow as an extra tool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet roots you...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the pet roots you and you are singing Selo&#39;s you<br/>
&gt; can usually break root the next round...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; good luck...even if you don&#39;t win, make sure your<br/>
&gt; opponent knows he was in a fight!<br/>
