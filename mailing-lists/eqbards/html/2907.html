&gt; This is what you do.  Use your fists, attack 3 to 4 low level critters in <br/>
&gt; misty, bring them near the tower.  The deputy will come out and HELP you <br/>
&gt; kill the critters.  Now fire up your selo and run far far away from the <br/>
&gt; tower.  Wait for the train and the deputy to get there and finish off the <br/>
&gt; critters there.  Now the deputy will WALK back to the tower.  You, on the <br/>
&gt; other hand, will RUN back with selo and drum.  Attack the little thief, and <br/>
&gt; bring him away from the tower to kill.  Make sure you don&#39;t take him to the <br/>
&gt; same path where the deputy is coming back from!!<br/>

away...though I&#39;m not a fan of such a tactic.<br/>

I had something similar happen to me at the Ruins in East Commonlands.  I<br/>
had _just_ gotten done lamenting all but the one undead I wanted to deal<br/>
with (all 3 were blue to yellow for me), and someone came up and pulled<br/>
the blue away just as I came up.  Guess what?  I ended up with the yellow<br/>
chasing me back to the guards (thank goodness I fire up selo as I&#39;m<br/>
running in--never know when a ghoul pops).<br/>

p.s. I think Measure sounds better than Octave or Chord--and it&#39;s more<br/>
fitting too, as each measure helps music grow, just like our levels help<br/>
us grow. :)<br/>
