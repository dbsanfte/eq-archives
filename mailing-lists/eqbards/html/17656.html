<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136690906">I have a PII 266 with 96 megs.. and if I feel like<br/>
paying enough attention I can twist 4 songs.  (Video<br/>
card is nothing special ATI Rage 2 with not a lot of<br/>
memory 16???)<br/>
<br/>
It is really too much watching of messages in battle<br/>
to twist 4 songs.. <br/>
<br/>
And lately Ive been grouped with 2 other bards, so Ive<br/>
gotten really lazy and sometimes only play one and<br/>
very rarely 3 songs.<br/>

&gt; I routinely twist 3-4 songs on my Pentium II 233,<br/>
&gt; but I do have 128 meg of<br/>
&gt; RAM (though only 16meg of video RAM). So I am<br/>
&gt; guessing that RAM might be<br/>
&gt; your problem. But is that really a K3? Like before<br/>
&gt; the K5/K6? I didnt think<br/>
&gt; they HAD a K3 400.<br/>
