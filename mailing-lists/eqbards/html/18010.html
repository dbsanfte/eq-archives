&gt; I did NOT notice this shortened duration for Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding,<br/>

&gt; movement portion of the song, and of course if the snare effect<br/>
&gt; breaks<br/>
&gt; the slowdown effect wears off as well.  Largo&#39;s, being a slowdown and<br/>
&gt; AC debuff, seems unaffected by the change.  I wonder, were Snare and<br/>
&gt; the Darkness series affected by this also?<br/>

of problem (early wear-off) for Root, Snare, Darkness and a number of <br/>
other spells as well.  Appears to be a widespread nerf.<br/>
