&gt;other than a ranger).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well you have 2 crowd control songs at level 30, mez and charm.  if they are<br/>
continuously getting more than 2 or 3 at a time, then maybe they need a new<br/>
puller and not an enchanter.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I play a bard primarily for RP reasons, but I think the bard class is a good<br/>
&gt;one.  If they would fix our broken or useless songs we would be fine.  Most<br/>
&gt;of the weakness I perceive in the bard class is not because of Verant&#39;s<br/>
&gt;vision of a bard.  It is mostly because Verant has made melee classes so<br/>
&gt;much less common than casting ones through some of their decisions.  EQ is<br/>
&gt;definitely a caster&#39;s game powerwise.  Melee characters might get all the<br/>
&gt;neat toys, but caster&#39;s get all the things that make playing easier.  If I<br/>
&gt;played with less casual players maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue.<br/>
&gt;Every time I get in a melee heavy group we have a great time and I can<br/>
&gt;contribut enormously.  In a caster heavy group all the weaknesses of the<br/>
&gt;bard class come to the forefront, and if there&#39;s an enchanter present I feel<br/>
&gt;pretty useless.  Unfortunately caster heavy groups seem to outnumber tank<br/>
&gt;heavy ones by about 5-1 at least.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ahh, we are pretty much a god class with the way that songs work currently, but<br/>
shhh, don&#39;t tell anybody.  it just depends if you are willing to play within the framework<br/>
that is provided, and be a little creative on how you deal with different situations.  that&#39;s<br/>
why i like my bard, there&#39;s a lot of problem solving with a lot of different tools (hey, i&#39;m<br/>
an engineer, heh), and that&#39;s a lot of fun for me.<br/>
