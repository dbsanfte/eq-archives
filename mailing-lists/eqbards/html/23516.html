<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357590268">I&#39;ve never seen him on the Black Scar cycle, only on the Fairie of Dismay cycle.  In any case, he wasn&#39;t<br/>
that hard to get.  We just go into Skyfire from BW between Ixlblat Fer pulls for the Clerics and pull any<br/>
named MOBs to zone.  Usually see him within a couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still five pieces short.  My guild is apparently bored with Fear (why go when only a few people need<br/>
things?), so the whip may not be that easy (I&#39;m hoping to multi-quest).  Phinegel is a sticking point; my<br/>
guild will drop anything for anyone&#39;s epic MOB but Phinny.  We haven&#39;t taken him in a month.  (Our senior<br/>
bard got his spine by buying a multi-quest from some group that looted it and had no bard.)  Red Scale I&#39;m<br/>
still behind several warriors.  White Scale is stupid, either kill the hardest dragon in Kunark or kill a<br/>
dragon that Verant won&#39;t let me fight.  And Trak guts?  Bah.  My guild doesn&#39;t seem interested in<br/>
bothering with Trak now that they can get so many easy BP drops in PoG.  And it&#39;s not like this is a<br/>
guaranteed drop, like it is with Ragefire (who is a pansy by comparison).  I think it&#39;s on the order of a<br/>
one in six shot.  I&#39;m not a happy bard atm.<br/>

&gt; Eldrig was my hardest piece.  took me a week every day in skyfire to get<br/>
&gt; him.  i hardly ever actually hunted for him.  i showed up every day, let the<br/>
&gt; zone know i needed him, and asked a member of each group there to let me<br/>
&gt; know if they saw him.  a lot of regulars there so i became known during that<br/>
&gt; week, and finally i get a tell one night that he was up.  booked over there<br/>
&gt; and nailed him.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named<br/>
&gt; &gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
