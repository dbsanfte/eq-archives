<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288586744">Speaking as a fellow bard on Povar, my biggest warning at level 20 is NOT to<br/>
venture past the Courtyard (CY). Even there, hug the corner to your<br/>
immediate left as you enter. Your group will need an expert puller to pull<br/>
from the maze or the hallways. Don&#39;t use any AE songs....and if someone<br/>
shouts TRAIN, RUN, do not WALK to the zone and fling yourself through it. At<br/>
levels 23-25 I had very high death rates in Cazic, attributable to out of<br/>
control trains that spilled back into the courtyard or to really<br/>
disorganized groups. If it looks like you&#39;re about to be trapped, get out<br/>
that horn or flute and invis yourself as fast as possible. Feel free to look<br/>
me up in game if you wish.<br/>

Subject: Cazic Advice<br/>
<br/>
All,<br/>
<br/>
I just became a newly minted Bard of 20 songs, and have read (a Cleric<br/>
guide, I believe) that I could start adventuring in Cazic.  The guide listed<br/>
as one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>
group skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>
before with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>
level 20?<br/>
<br/>
2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of rogues<br/>
around, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>
<br/>
3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>
the Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>
<br/>
4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>
isn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
