<b>Subject:</b> Looks like Lullaby is broken <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960848199">My group derailed a train at the zone in Mistmoore last night<br/>
while ressing people at the zone.  The enchanter had just<br/>
left, so I fired up Lullaby and turned on my logfile.  <br/>
Afterwards, I went through and tallied up the results by hand<br/>
(Win98 did something to make Linux unbootable so I couldn&#39;t<br/>
automate it...)<br/>
<br/>
All the mobs were green to low blue to me.  I got experience<br/>
on 4 or 5 of them.  L45 bard, 154 charisma, lute equipped.<br/>
<br/>
N = nods<br/>
r = nods, but succeeds at secondary resist<br/>
R = resists entirely<br/>
- = killed<br/>

Comments:  This isn&#39;t as bad as it looks at first glance<br/>
because I&#39;m pretty sure Lullaby works like Pixie Strike, where<br/>
once a mob is nodded (N), a (r) results in the mob staying<br/>
nodded.  i.e. &quot;rrrrr&quot; represents the mob staying awake for 5<br/>
rounds, but &quot;Nrrrr&quot; represents the mob staying asleep for 5<br/>
rounds (assuming you get Lullaby to pulse again before the<br/>
previous pulse expires - those stupid pets kept bashing me out<br/>
of my song and this wasn&#39;t the case a couple times).<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
- The chance of mobs outright resisting (R) is 5% at my<br/>
charisma and against these low level mobs.  It would seem my<br/>
charisma is high enough that I&#39;ve hit the 5% cap, at least<br/>
against these low level mobs.  This is about what I&#39;d expect<br/>
considering 154 is pretty high by anyone&#39;s standards.<br/>
<br/>
- Secondary resists (r) are not working as GZ said.  During<br/>
the Lullaby test, he said the chance of a secondary resist<br/>
ranged from 25% to 35% (against L1 and even /con mobs<br/>
respectively - I finally read the log :), modified by<br/>
charisma.  I&#39;m getting roughly 50% secondary resists against<br/>
green mobs, higher against low blues, which would indicate<br/>
something is broken.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the mobs buffed themselves with magic resist<br/>
since their chance of a primary resist was at the 5%<br/>
cap.  The dark ritualist pet that was summoned after someone<br/>
killed the first one (neat trick that :) most certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>
buffed in any way, yet still had a secondary resist rate of<br/>
57%.<br/>
