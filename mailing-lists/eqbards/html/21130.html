<br/>
With the weapons listed, I&#39;ll deviate from the advice already given <br/>
and say you&#39;re better off with the Ebon Razor in primary and SSoY in <br/>
secondary.  At least for those specific weapons.<br/>
<br/>
To use the SSoY in your primary, and take advantage of the extra <br/>
proc, you&#39;ll have to put an inferior weapon in your secondary.  The <br/>
Ebon Razor is close enough in damage output (it has a better ratio) <br/>
to the SSoY that I think you&#39;ll have better total damage with this <br/>
combination than with the SSoY and any other weapon you currectly <br/>
have in your second hand.<br/>
<br/>
But, as has been suggested, getting a better offhand weapon might be <br/>
the best solution long term.  Only problem, on Xegony, Sionatchies <br/>
Partisans are hard to come by.  I&#39;ve been looking for weeks and weeks <br/>
to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Run some /log on tests with a Parser to see which combination is <br/>
giving you better results.<br/>
