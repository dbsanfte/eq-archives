with us.  But I&#39;ve seen it enough to figure it&#39;s either a bug<br/>

that you&#39;re fighting their friends), or a feature (some kind<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been noticing something similar, except with Psalm of<br/>
Warmth.  When I&#39;m weaving 4 songs, usually the current song<br/>
icon disappears a second or two before it reappears.  But<br/>
sometimes I manage to get all 4 going at once.  When this<br/>
happens, it&#39;s almost always PoW that I&#39;m singing.  I&#39;ll have<br/>
to time it (next month, need to catch up on work :-) but I<br/>
suppose it&#39;s possible that certain songs take longer or<br/>
shorter to start up.<br/>
