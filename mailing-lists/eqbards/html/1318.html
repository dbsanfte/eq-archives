<br/>
Sylly here -- a bard of level 6 on Innoruuk bound at Freeport for the time<br/>
being.  Journeyed up from Qeynos last weekend.  Actually made several trips<br/>
bringing our friends up with Celos.  I am getting really tired of falling<br/>
off that wall in King Xorbb!  Does anyone use the left side for the first<br/>
third then cross the base and use the right side for the second third (going<br/>
from EK to Runnyeye)??  There is that one really sharp cornor and I fall<br/>
everytime for half my hp!  I suppose I could get lower and fall less :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone done the jumjum juice quest in Rivervale?  You have to<br/>
deliver jumjum juice - by the ton prolly to someone in RV and eventually you<br/>
get a pretty good prize?  Anyone know the details?  I am finding jumjum<br/>
juice by the case in EC off bixies.  But each case weighs 10 and I get<br/>
totally encumbered.<br/>
