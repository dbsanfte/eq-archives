<b>Subject:</b> My first impression of the desert (story) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689658082">Hail<br/>
<br/>
    This is a short story about an event that happened to me earlier today.<br/>
I&#39;m an lvl 9 wood elf bard and I just came to Freeport to meet a friend and<br/>
to buy songs for further usage. I decided that it would be nice to look at<br/>
the desert so I went in the Northern Ro and killed a couple of orc riders.<br/>
They were all blue to me. Then I met a tarantula, yellow to me, and I<br/>
attacked her, I just wanted to see if I could win. I started twisting<br/>
Jonthans&#39;s whistling war song with Hymn of Restoration and sometimes I added<br/>
Chords of Dissonance. I can&#39;t twist more than two songs because of the lag.<br/>
On the end I managed to kill the tarantula with 11 hp left and then when I<br/>
finally relaxed KABOOM :) an orc rider attacked me. I was hit for 16 damage<br/>
with his first blow and knocked down unconscious. I was still singing the<br/>
Hymn when he knocked me down so my health was rising slowly. Then I regained<br/>
consciences and  KABOOM  I was on the ground again. At that time I thought I<br/>
was dead and I just waited for a message LOADING....<br/>
    I waited and waited and waited.... I waited for 6 minutes and 34<br/>
seconds. Then I regained conscious again and I pressed my Call for help<br/>
button. No one was around and I was on the floor again. I waited for 4 or 5<br/>
more minutes while the orc was hitting me and then finally I regained<br/>
consciences and he missed. So there was I with 3 hp left and I gave him a<br/>
blow for 4 damage and then he gave me a blow for 10 damage and then here we<br/>
go again.... me on the ground.... me standing KABOOM.... me on the<br/>
ground.... and so on and on and on.... I was hitting him point by point<br/>
until I have won the battle, with 3 or 4 hp. The whole thing lasted for 23<br/>
minutes and I don&#39;t have to say that the only thing that kept me alive was<br/>
my song. After the battle I have equipped my drum, played Selo&#39;s and<br/>
returned to Freeport without a nerve left in my body.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you liked the story.<br/>
