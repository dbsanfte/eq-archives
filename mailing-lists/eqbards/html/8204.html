 </span></blockquote>Ahh I missed the lower level aspect to the story.  I thought<br/>
we were discussing higher levels.  Even at 19 when you first<br/>
start seeing your caps move to 100, H2H still is very lacking<br/>
as my 100 H2H does not beat a level 1 monk with 5 points trained<br/>
in H2H.  So even if a level 10 warrior had a 55 hand to hand and<br/>
magic fists he still wouldn&#39;t be able to beat up wisps, where<br/>
a monk of similar or lesser level could do it with little problems.  <br/>
Magic fists or not, no melee type can win with just fists, except <br/>
a monk, in the lower levels.<br/>
