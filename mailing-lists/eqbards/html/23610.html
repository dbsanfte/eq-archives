<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507640247">Yahoo bought out Egroups a couple of months back.  I moderate another Egroup<br/>
mailing list and got a notification several weeks back of the impending<br/>
change.  However, I didn&#39;t get a notification anytime recently announcing<br/>
the change was gonna happen today.  I tried to access my guild&#39;s Egroups<br/>
website today and before I could access it, I had to register for a Yahoo<br/>
ID.  Once I registered for the Yahoo ID, all of my subscriptions to the<br/>
Egroups lists I belong to were automatically converted over to Yahoo.  I<br/>
believe you only need to get a Yahoo ID/email account if you intend to use<br/>
the other features available on the eqbards mailing list website (chat,<br/>
calendar, database, etc).  <br/>

What&#39;s with this Yahoogroups thing? All of my bard mail is being delivered <br/>
to my &quot;spam&quot; mail box as it&#39;s not recognizing this as coming from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqbards@egroups.com">eqbards@egroups.com</a> anymore. I guess this is our new group?<br/>
