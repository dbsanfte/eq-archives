If your a nec like me i was able to kick his butt at easy. Try it heck zone <br/>
is just a few steps away and u can pull him closer to the zone just in case <br/>
or if your scared just hit him with vortex, siphon strength and heart <br/>
flutter after sending pet first so the pet is agroed the most. Then hit <br/>
with englufing darkness and fear 2 times and hes dead so use all your mana <br/>
to make sure your safe from harms way. And dont worry about being manaless, <br/>
zone is right there not to mention pet can solo anything that might attack <br/>
you out of the blue.<br/>
