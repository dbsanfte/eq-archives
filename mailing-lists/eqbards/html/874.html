&gt; &gt;I remember seeing a discussion going on about, where to purchase the <br/>
&gt; &gt;Water Breathing song , and its effect is obvious, but my question is,<br/>
&gt; &gt;is it useful ? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, very.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Are there any dungeons that are completely under water? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, plus many non-dungeon places to explore that are underwater.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, has anyone figured out if being underwater<br/>
also means being out of sight?  e.g. if there&#39;s a giant by the<br/>
river, can you swim past him underwater?  Or can they see<br/>
through water like they can through walls?<br/>
<br/>
And has anyone else noticed they seem to have added more music<br/>
to the game?  At first I thought it was new because I&#39;d just<br/>
started using a wind instrument.  But then I started hearing<br/>
the tune with my other instruments, and other tunes while I<br/>
was passing different buildings.<br/>
