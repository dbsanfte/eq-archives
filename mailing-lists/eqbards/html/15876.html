<div id="ygrps-yiv-311237141"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sounds like a bug.  It should only be happening with Niv&#39;s, as<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s the only song that&#39;s supposed to have a spell damage<br/>
&gt; shield (once the shield absorbs the damage, the shield/song<br/>
&gt; drops).  If it&#39;s happening with other resist songs, I&#39;d /bug<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m positive this is happening.  It was happening constantly.<br/>
  And I could reproduce it.  I encourage others to test elemental<br/>
  in particular.  Not purifying.  Not guardian.  It happens on <br/>
  mystic shielding sometimes too.<br/>

&gt; had no problems with it.  There are some cases (usually when a<br/>
&gt; DoT is in effect) where charm will not wipe the damage<br/>
&gt; history.  There&#39;s speculation too that it&#39;s only effective<br/>
&gt; about 90% of the time at wiping the damage list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I am extremely efficient at twinking exp for people.  I noticed<br/>
  I couldn&#39;t do it last night.  But I&#39;ll check again.  I ran three<br/>
  tests, so it hard to be a coincidence three times.<br/>
