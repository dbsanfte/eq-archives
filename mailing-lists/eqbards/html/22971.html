<div id="ygrps-yiv-132321016">Heh, funny how your reasons are so similar to my own. I played a wizard<br/>
starting in beta 1 and got him to lvl 25 before phase 3 started... i quit<br/>
soon as it did. Mostly because clarity wasnt in the game yet (though<br/>
enchanters where awesomely powerful thx thx whirl till you hurl) and then<br/>
they nerfed rain spells. One of our favorite things to do was have two tanks<br/>
run around lower runneye and make a massive train while me and another<br/>
wizard friend would cast rain spells from far, far away. Worked awesome,<br/>
well, except the tanks tended to die if they got a bit too eager pulling :)<br/>
<br/>
Then somebody posted about us doing that on the dev board and walla... rain<br/>
spells where useless. So i quit till final in disgust, figuring they wouldnt<br/>
need me to help betatest with phase 3 starting. When final did roll out I<br/>
picked the one class that could speed up med times, and never regreted it. I<br/>
am probably the only bard out there that doesnt feel insulted when people<br/>
beg for the mana song :)<br/>

&gt; i was a wizard in beta3.  got to level 18, then they changed the way AC<br/>
&gt; works and i died too much.  i finally broke down and started letting my<br/>
wife<br/>
&gt; play.  a friend of ours told us how the level 7 and level 10 songs stacked<br/>
&gt; (when they did back then) and how sweet it was LOL.  even though they<br/>
fixed<br/>
&gt; that long ago, that is how it got started.  i quit the wizard and started<br/>
&gt; playing my wife&#39;s bard, and that continued in final til she started her<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; cleric.  i wanted to stay a bard because of being a casting class with<br/>
plate<br/>
&gt; armor *grin* and also wood elves are just hot.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bardic class.<br/>
