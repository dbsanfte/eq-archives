<b>Subject:</b> Lute of the Gypsy Princess un-nerfed? DOUBLE the effect?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-999108198">Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able to heal 45 points <br/>
per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess found in Mistmoore. He is a lvl <br/>
45 bard. Can anyone verify this info? I was not near him to test it out, and <br/>
he blows alot of hot air at times.  So I just wanted to see if anyone else <br/>
is experiencing this insane (that&#39;s not a complaint) rise in our bretheren&#39;s <br/>
ability to heal with song.<br/>
<br/>
This info blew my mind (not to mention irritated the hell out of my cleric <br/>
gf, heheheh). I had never bothered to get this item because I knew that it <br/>
was nerfed and worked only as well as a regular stringed instrument. I also <br/>
hate Castle Mistmoore. =)  Whatever Verant was planning on doing with this <br/>
item as far as magical properties, I NEVER expected this! Does this also <br/>
mean our lvl 2 and lvl 48 DoT songs are that much more powerful? &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone, someone please test and post as I do not have the item available to <br/>
do so myself. =(<br/>
