<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627234620">When i was low 20&#39;s my friends were high 20&#39;s and we were in mm. Well<br/>
someone pulled a big train through to the zone with the gypsies.  Anyways,<br/>
after multiple zones and rezones. the zone was finally clear, we head down<br/>
the ramp and what do we see.... the named gypsie alone by the little lake<br/>
with a charmed magician and his pet. We went for it.  We almost bit it as<br/>
the magician was attacking us as he was charmed, his pet was on us, and the<br/>
gypsie charmed our druid as well... Needless to say it wasnt pleasant to get<br/>
bit in the butt while i was trying to kill off the pet and had the magician<br/>
on me as well. But finally the rest of the group finished her off, the druid<br/>
became uncharmed and we had to cast about 10 uncharm spells on the magicians<br/>
to get him uncharmed *was really crazy*<br/>
<br/>
But hey, im not complaining, no one died and i had my mm drum when i was<br/>
lev21 or so. And 2 nights later my buddies bought the lute of gypsie<br/>
princess for 5pp from a guy in the zone. Too bad it doesnt do squat!<br/>

&gt; I have the mistmoor drums. I got them off  a castle train when I was about<br/>
&gt; 32. My group was at the zone when we heard &quot;TRAIN! CHOO CHOO A COMING<br/>
&gt; THROUGH&quot; We saw every imaginable creature at the zone..heh  I was charmed<br/>
&gt; almost immediately and got to watch my friends slice me to bits (grin).<br/>
&gt; Well<br/>
&gt; they droppped me, they dropped the named gypsy..and they looted and ran.<br/>
&gt; When I got back they presented me with my very own battledrums. Do I<br/>
&gt; recommed going after her before your 40?..NO..but if you do..PLEASE  use<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; much magic resist as possible to save yourself from being charmed! Since<br/>
&gt; mm<br/>
&gt; castle trains (at least on MY server) are an ever occuring thing, one can<br/>
&gt; concievabley camp the zone for the gypsy. Harmonic..I know what your<br/>
&gt; thinking..NO I won&#39;t help you get them :) The offer for sol A still stands<br/>
&gt; though  :)<br/>

&gt; --&gt;I have been told that a named gypsy NPC drops the battle drum.  Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;one myself but looking forward to it.  I have only been in Mistmoore 3-4<br/>
&gt; &gt;times but on two of those occasions someone was auctioning the battle<br/>
&gt; drum<br/>
&gt; &gt;for 500PP.<br/>
&gt; &gt;BTW, one time someone pulled a train of the gypsies to the zone.  There<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt;two regular gypsies and the named gypsy.  I had just zoned in.  There<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.  People started<br/>
&gt; &gt;dropping like flies<br/>
&gt; &gt; That leads me to believe you need a group of 30+ players to<br/>
&gt; &gt;survive against the gypsies.<br/>
