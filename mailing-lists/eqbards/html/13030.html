<b>Subject:</b> /shout Level 32 mana battery looking for a group! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-545145114">This is really for the Eci people on this list.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to fill out the rest of my regular group and having a bit<br/>
of a problem.  I&#39;m specifically looking for an enchanter and a cleric.<br/>
Our current group is myself (32 bard), a 32 wizard, a 34 warrior and<br/>
on occasion a 29 druid.  The druid&#39;s spot is open pretty often and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind finding someone more regular to fill it also.  We play<br/>
around 7pm-midnight pacific.  If anyone knows clueful people who might<br/>
be interested in &quot;trying out&quot; for one of these spots, please have them<br/>
send me a tell in game or shoot me an email.  I&#39;m getting desperate.<br/>
<br/>
