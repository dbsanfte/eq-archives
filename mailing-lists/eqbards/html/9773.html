<b>Subject:</b> OMG!  GZ finally replied <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-950948810">Well, after 3 tries, I finally got a reply to the list of questions that we<br/>
put together to send to GZ.  Don&#39;t know if all the answers are exactly what<br/>
I might have hoped to hear, but its nice to at least get some info.  The<br/>
questions may not be exactly what we had originally put together, I revised<br/>
this each time I sent it in as some things were corrected already with<br/>
patches (lack of bard quests) and some new things came up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn Heartstring<br/>
Level 50 Bard<br/>
Erollisi Marr<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
GZ: I have gotten really behind on my e-mail - just because of the volume<br/>
that I get.  I try to answer every one I get, but for the past 2 months this<br/>
just hasn&#39;t been possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: Where, oh where are our missings songs?!  Several of our songs<br/>
(levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the game.  We would like to know<br/>
when we can expect these to be implemented.  If they are indeed in the game<br/>
already(perhaps discovered via quests) please at least let us know that they<br/>
exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to get them, or even what they are,<br/>
but we don&#39;t want to waste our time questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
We&#39;ve been without these songs (whatever they are) since day one of release,<br/>
and its become a point of serious aggrivation for us.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>
break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to be able to<br/>
add new abilities to Bards as the game contintued.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to<br/>
have no effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many<br/>
bards.  It does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it<br/>
should) nor does it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please<br/>
confirm whether this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: I will check this one out.  It *should* cast cancel magic on your entire<br/>
group - and did at one point of beta.  It is high on my list of things to<br/>
check out/get fixed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Well, i just fixed the horn.  We should have a drum at some time - I<br/>
just don&#39;t know when.  Sorry.  I think we will try to sneak it in on our<br/>
next graphics patch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>
spell uses.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book show what instrument skill is<br/>
required when you right click on a song?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Good question.  I think I can get that added.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>
aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>
were raised such that at least they worked more than 1 out of 20 times, we<br/>
might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: A lot of these skills are &#39;given&#39; to Bards, even though they won&#39;t ever<br/>
get good at them.  I&#39;ll check on the caps with one of the programmers, but I<br/>
doubt that will change much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo&#39;s when in an<br/>
outdoor zone, would &#39;break&#39; the effects of the root spell.  With a recent<br/>
patch, this is no longer the case.  Was it a bug that it broke root<br/>
originally, or is it a bug that now it doesn&#39;t?  When could we expect a fix<br/>
for this if it is a bug?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.  We had it<br/>
breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too powerful, since it<br/>
is a free song that bards keep mem&#39;d all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: It is currently possible to cast SoW, or use Jboots, then enter an<br/>
indoor zone and enjoy enhanced speed for the next 30 minutes or so.  This<br/>
seems to us a little unfair, as our song works only outdoors.  Are there any<br/>
plans to either A) make Selo&#39;s work indoors, or B) to not allow SoW and<br/>
Jboots to work indoors?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Possibly.  But remember - Bards are similar to Hybrid spell casters on<br/>
their power levels - they are not pure spell casters - their songs won&#39;t be<br/>
as powerful as a pure caster.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: Bards currently don&#39;t have the ability to meditate.  This is fine, we<br/>
don&#39;t really need or want it, and we understand that giving us meditate<br/>
would reduce the recovery time from the level 43 song.  It does however take<br/>
us an inordinatly long amount of time to memorize our songs.  Quite<br/>
literally, memorizing all our songs after a death takes at least ten times<br/>
as long as a caster.  Is there any possibility of memorization time being<br/>
reduced in the future?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: That is something that we will be talking about at our next tuning<br/>
meeting - possibly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: The level 28 song, Crisson&#39;s Pixie Strike seems to be bugged.  When<br/>
used, 1 of 3 things may happen.  1, The mob is mezmerized and stands there<br/>
for ~12 seconds which is what we&#39;d expect.  2, The mob resists the spell, we<br/>
get a resist message and nothing happens.  This is also an expected result.<br/>
3, The mob is hit with the song, no resist message, and no mezmerize effect<br/>
takes place.  This happens pretty often.  It will often take 5 or 6 hits<br/>
with pixie strike (with no message) before a mob is truly mezmerized, after<br/>
which its relatively simple to keep the mez in place by repeatedly pixie<br/>
striking them.  What is up with this lack of resist message yet no effect<br/>
taking place.  This can easily be demonstrated by striking yourself.  You&#39;ll<br/>
get the message to the effect that you&#39;ve been struck, yet you can still<br/>
move about fine.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: I&#39;ll check on that one - not sure.<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Hope that helps a bit.  :)<br/>
