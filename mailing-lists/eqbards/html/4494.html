<b>Subject:</b> Limit on song memorization <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497063335">Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to memorizing only<br/>
eight songs at a time?  I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>
had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>
Many of their spells at higher levels are just improved versions of<br/>
spells they had at lower levels.  They don&#39;t really have to worry about<br/>
memorizing their low level spells once they reach a certain point.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t the case for us.  With a few exceptions, almost all of our songs<br/>
each have their own unique effect.<br/>
<br/>
I can safely say that I will almost always have Selos and Hymn of<br/>
Restoration memorized.  Anthem or Warsong is another automatic.  That<br/>
leaves me with 5 slots for all the remaining 18 songs I know.  If the<br/>
choice is hard now, I can&#39;t imagine what its like later on down the<br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Verant will ever add 8 more spell/song slots for the right<br/>
side of the screen. Even more optimistically, I wonder if Verant will<br/>
ever make it where we don&#39;t have to memorize songs at all but instead<br/>
know them all by heart.  This would give us the ability to sing any song<br/>
at any time as long as we had it in our songbook.  I realize this is<br/>
wishful thinking on my part but you never know.  Maybe with the<br/>
expansion.<br/>
