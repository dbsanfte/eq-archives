Fellow Moonie, I cannot lie to you. You were one of the people I was<br/>
thinking of with that tidbit. The rest of the tidbit was, I recall, &quot;and it<br/>
seemed too soon to me.&quot; Emphasis on *to me*. Perhaps I should have added<br/>
IMHO. :)<br/>
<br/>
I grouped with another merchant character in my teens, a warrior with full<br/>
crafted at 15, two langseaxes, and later some thulian claws. He had flooded<br/>
the market with crude steins with another character and was now reaping the<br/>
benefits. Like you, he had many hours of play time between his characters,<br/>
had earned a ton of pp, yet had no character above 20 yet. Others figured he<br/>
was a twink, but I was proud to say I hung out with the richest 17th lvl<br/>
warrior in Norrath. You both put your time in and earned what you have. I&#39;m<br/>
happy for you, brother.<br/>
<br/>
The point I was making was that I am not comfortable with the perception of<br/>
twinking. I enjoy being at or slightly above the power-curve for my level,<br/>
but I would be embarrased to display Lambent or rubicite before lvl 20. I<br/>
suppose it would be because I would feel compelled to explain why I deserved<br/>
it. I&#39;d rather impress others with my actions, songs, and wit (and since I&#39;m<br/>
not wealthy, those are my only options &lt;g&gt;). That&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to justify yourself, Double. People will think what they want<br/>
nomatter what you say. You earned your gear, you display it proudly and mock<br/>
those who question you. Your cocky personality fits perfectly with your name<br/>
and your playstyle. One thing EQ needs more than anything is colorful<br/>
characters, and they don&#39;t come more colorful than you, Song Brother! =D<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve seen high teen bards with lotsa dough and<br/>

&gt; Hehe, you wouldn&#39;t happen to be talking about me,<br/>
&gt; would you? :) Just before I dinged 20, I managed to<br/>
&gt; get the greaves, bp and gauntlets. The greaves and<br/>
&gt; gauntlets were a gracious gift from my mother. The bp<br/>
&gt; I got on my own (I had help only as far as killing the<br/>
