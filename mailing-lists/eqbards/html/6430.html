&gt; For one - they resisted my chain but not my binds. Two, when under the<br/>
&gt; effect of song - they did not fight back as the party beat them down (at<br/>
&gt; least I did not see the &quot;hits so and so for xx dmg and the animation seemed<br/>
&gt; to stop and most of all the party dint show hp loss.)  I only did this for<br/>
&gt; about and hour or so - so it&#39;s a pretty weak sample.  Need to really do it<br/>
&gt; more and pay better attention (log file and one of the analyzers too.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I tested out Binding last night in Solusek B against greater<br/>
kobolds (blue to red to me).  I couldn&#39;t time it as accurately<br/>
since most of these fights were pretty close for my group, but<br/>
the time between attacks dropped from about 3 seconds to 4<br/>
seconds (c.f. 3.0 to 3.8 sec testing it on beetles).  <br/>
Chaining the mob as well did not slow it down any further.  <br/>
Resist rate was about the same for both, so area effect and AC<br/>
drop vs slower movement should dictate which of the two you<br/>
want to use.  And they most certainly do attack while under<br/>
the effect, they just don&#39;t attack as often.<br/>
<br/>
The enchanter was playing with her new L39 spells, and their<br/>
attack slowdown is significantly slower than Chain/Binding.<br/>
I&#39;d estimate a roughly 2x slowdown vs 1.25x for ours.  It did<br/>
not seem to stack, but it&#39;s tough to see the difference<br/>
between 2x and 2.25x.  I&#39;ll have to time it with a less<br/>
effective enchanter debuff in the future.<br/>
<br/>
For those who group with enchanters, debuffs do not wake mobs<br/>
that have been mesmerized/Lullabyed/Pixie Struck.  You can<br/>
Tashan, Chain, Bind, weaken, cancel, etc. to your heart&#39;s<br/>
content and they will not wake up.<br/>
