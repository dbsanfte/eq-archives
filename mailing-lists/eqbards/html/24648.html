<div id="ygrps-yiv-509159696">I&#39;ve been fighting alot in SS in the CY at the left closest corner. Our<br/>
tanks pull to there. I&#39;ll twist two songs and then throw up mana song. I do<br/>
a mana check and if mana is good Ill concentrate on buffs and dots. If mana<br/>
is low ill get in melee range and sing mana song while i hack and slash. I<br/>
do the same thing in the King room in Solb and the range is fine. Cantana of<br/>
soothing doesnt seem to regen as much mana as Chorus does. Of course I have<br/>
yet to test the range on Cantana of Replenishment so I dont know bout that<br/>
song. Point is situation will dictate and so will your hunting ground. There<br/>
is a use for every song in most situations.<br/>

  I&#39;ve always found mana song (chorus of clarity) to se useless in combat.<br/>
  Its radius is so small that half the time, the medders are out of range.<br/>
  Cantana seems to have a much more friendly radius...<br/>
<br/>
  I really have trouble thinking of a situation where this won&#39;t be in my<br/>
  weave...<br/>
