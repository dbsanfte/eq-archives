<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298255488"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; had zero chance of escape and the caster&#39;s had zero chance of death.  And<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not quite.  They are not concerned about you avoiding a train.  They don&#39;t want you pulling huge trains to zone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>
&gt; not I fail to see.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instantaneous travel doesn&#39;t cause the train to keep running to zone.  Fast travel allows someone to lead the entire dungeon to the<br/>
zone exit, causing many people to die.<br/>
<br/>
Think about some of the worst zones for random deaths from trains, Mistmoore, Unrest, BlackBurrow.  All these zones are &quot;outdoors&quot;<br/>
and allow speed effects.  The trainmaker can run fast and make it to zone, and lets everyone else deal with the trainwreck.<br/>
<br/>
In the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are usually less trains to zone (there are exceptions).  This is because the person<br/>
who gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make it to zone.  They will die 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>
<br/>
A caster gating out has the same effect as death.  The monster drops the player off the hate list.  Unless someone else is also on<br/>
the hate list (or too close), the monster will return to it&#39;s normal spot.</div>
