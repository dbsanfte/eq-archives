&gt; on it can no longer be chained and will tear off to find help. This nearly <br/>
&gt; killed me last night in Solusek&#39;s Eye. I was healing at the clockworks <br/>

effect.  I had no problems chaining myself.  I really hope<br/>
this is a bug and not another silly make-the-mobs-work-by-<br/>
different-rules-than-players nerf.<br/>
