<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074112709">Well last night while praying for trains in mistmoore so me and another<br/>
bardic friend could try to pick off a gypsie or a deathly usher i got bored<br/>
and decided to go pull some stuff....   So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>
named invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>
something like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc and<br/>
he&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it was<br/>
a quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>
your faction with sol ro got worse<br/>
your faction with shadowmen got better <br/>
<br/>
Ugh!  and to top things off i decided to get creative before this and went<br/>
all the way in the castle to the gypsie room (woohoo i know where they are<br/>
now) and decided to tap her on the shoulder and make a run for it<br/>
screetching to  the zone....  i didnt make it *mumbles something about<br/>
casters*  <br/>
<br/>
Though i died, i still came out ahead at the end of the night and laughed<br/>
about my mini train, but the faction hit really hurt, im now apprehensive in<br/>
the temple and the npcs wont talk to me unless i use my faction song,<br/>
luckily the other bard that took the hit had killed many shadowmen to get<br/>
his faction up and he&#39;s still ok in the temple.<br/>
