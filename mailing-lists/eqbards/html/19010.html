<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They failed to mention in today&#39;s patch message that the AC on our<br/>
&gt;singing steel armor has been adjusted to match our fellow plate wearer&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the reason the patch message abbreviation of our song name was so<br/>
irritating because it is part of a general problem not because of its own<br/>
specific incident.  It&#39;s readily apparent that bards are often treated as an<br/>
afterthought.  Our songs regularly fail even the most trivial testing when<br/>
introduced (heal target rather than harm, are DoT&#39;s that only work on self,<br/>
do nothing, etc.) and that really annoys people.  It was like a sore that<br/>
had been festering for months, and that line in the patch message was just<br/>
another poke at the sore by Verant.<br/>

Did anyone notice that procs were going off far more than usual last nite?<br/>
I have been wielding two proc&#39;ing weapons a lot since I&#39;ve been in good<br/>
groups lately and noticed last night what I thought was an overabundance of<br/>
procs.  Since it seemed high I checked with prior results I had gotten and<br/>
the number of procs was definitely a lot higher last night.  Somewhere on<br/>
the order of going from 3 per fight to 7 per fight with the same mobs.  Did<br/>
anyone else notice this?  I plan to get numbers tonite.<br/>
