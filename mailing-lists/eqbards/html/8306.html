&gt;Was wondering what happens if you are fighting a spellcasting mob and sing<br/>
&gt;the teleport song?  For example, an ogre shaman is standing in front of you<br/>
&gt;and starts casting a spell.  As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>
&gt;started casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>
&gt;successfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>
&gt;could move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>
&gt;you further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>
&gt;affected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>
<br/>

teleporting doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
Point #2 - Mobs (monsters/NPCs, etc.) have no Mana as PCs do.  Thus, it<br/>
would not matter if they ran out.<br/>
I suppose you *could* teleport out of range, but that&#39;s just plain silly to<br/>
depend on.<br/>
