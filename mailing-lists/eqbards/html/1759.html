<div id="ygrps-yiv-116645468">plan on maxing your 1h blunt because you will want a staff of writhing in<br/>
your primary hand.  it means you can not use a demon claw, but a tomahawk or<br/>
better yet a black enameled mace in your second hand is an awesome combo.<br/>

&gt; You outgrow a tomahawk fairly quickly.  The spell effect on it goes up as<br/>
&gt; you level, increasing STR, but also decreasing AGI .  After a while, that<br/>
&gt; AGI loss pretty much negates the magic skin(which doesn&#39;t go up in the<br/>
&gt; amount of damage it can absorb), and keep in mind that while skinned, you<br/>
&gt; can still be bashed and run stunned.  Either one stops your songs cold,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can get you killed at the wrong time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s some interesting points in this note, some of which seems to be at<br/>
odds<br/>
with what other players have been telling me, particularly about the &quot;magic<br/>
skin&quot; effect not increasing in the amount of damage it soaks up as you get<br/>
higher in level, but since I have no experience, I won&#39;t argue with you.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note though, the tomahawk&#39;s effect no longer stops or locks up<br/>
your<br/>
song, which is good news for bards.<br/>
<br/>
Something else you didn&#39;t mention which I think is important is that the<br/>
tomahawk is really a tank&#39;s weapon.  The strength from the effect is nice,<br/>
but<br/>
you&#39;re really using that thing for the invulnerability, and if you&#39;re just a<br/>
hitter in your group and not the one taking most of the damage, then the<br/>
tomahawk would be much better off being a barbed leather whip or some other<br/>
more<br/>
efficient weapon.<br/>
