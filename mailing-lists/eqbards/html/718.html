<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481643587">I created a Half Elf and have a base Str of 95.  My Half Elf Ranger and Wood<br/>
Elf Ranger friends are both constantly encumbered and either skip loot or<br/>
fight impoverished if we&#39;re not close to a merchant.  Lavastorm is one area<br/>
that comes to mind.  I&#39;m almost in full banded, except for some magical<br/>
pieces and still have an advantage, while they can only acquire a few choice<br/>
pieces of banded.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest str.  : )<br/>

&gt;other of my type can&#39;t - even without killing to adjust factions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have purchased very expensive items for people at such savings that I got<br/>
&gt;a few plat for myself as a reward.<br/>

&gt;There&#39;s no simple answer about stats, it&#39;s just based on what kind of<br/>
&gt;character you want to play. I would add the Roleplay bit into it... think<br/>
&gt;about your character and what he/she is like. Take the attributes you think<br/>
&gt;your character really has.<br/>

&gt;Just wanted to add my 2 cents on the stats issue..i have seen many people<br/>
&gt;say to pump all u can into strength cause u&#39;ll need it for that heavy<br/>
&gt;armor...this is true..but..i personally only put 5 into str to bring my<br/>
&gt;half-elf str up to 80...why would i do this ?  simple with 8- i could wear<br/>
&gt;full chain and have enough str to carry quite a bit of loot without being<br/>
&gt;encumbered..o what about that heavy plate..not to worry..i for 1 dont plan<br/>
&gt;on buying regular plate as it is heavy and ridicously expensive..i am<br/>
&gt;currently level 26 and upgrading slowly to pieces of lizard.ie mantle and<br/>
&gt;cape..and rubicite.  This armor if u didnt know is much lighter than plate<br/>
&gt;and just as good(i think, i dont have stats on all pieces)..also got a<br/>
&gt;thick leather apron from unrest  ac8 weight 1....<br/>
&gt;2ndly as you get this high there are plenty of magical items to pump up<br/>
&gt;your strength..both as loot and now from enchanters as they get higher up<br/>
&gt;in level.<br/>
&gt;So as you can see dont worry if your not arnold the bard...i found my<br/>
&gt;pumped dex and agility much more useful as lowere level than i would<br/>
&gt;strength...:)<br/>

&gt;&gt;I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>
&gt;&gt;enabling you to wear better armor later among other things already<br/>
&gt;mentioned<br/>
&gt;&gt;in other posts.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.  I play a<br/>
&gt;&gt;wood-elf and a half-elf , putting most of the extra points into strength<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;both characters and there isnt a difference in playability that I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;&gt;far.  The wood-elf is my favorite though only for convenience sake since<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt;get forage and hide right off the bat where as half&#39;elves dont.  If you<br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt;being human go for it, never played one yet as I dont like the lack of<br/>
&gt;night<br/>
&gt;&gt;vision.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hope this helps =)<br/>
