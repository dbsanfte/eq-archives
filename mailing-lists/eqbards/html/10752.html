<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081129181">You&#39;re right.  Lullaby is a *great* song.  However.<br/>
<br/>
No sir.  Not me.  In a group of 6 camping a room in lower guk at our levels<br/>
(I&#39;m 35, you&#39;re 34) there&#39;s no way in hell you&#39;d get me to try and lullaby a<br/>
room of frogs, even WITH a cleric.  Maybe, if all I was trying to do was buy<br/>
my friends some time to make the zone or evac us.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;m not a tank.  As much as I like getting in the face of a<br/>
frog and pounding on it, if it hits me more than a few times I have to step<br/>
back out of the fight because I&#39;m down to two bubbles of health.  I have a<br/>
grand total of 792 HPs before buffs.  Lullabying a room is one sure way of<br/>
getting the exclusive attention of the two or three frogs that the tanks and<br/>
casters in your group *aren&#39;t* assisting on.  The tanks absorb, dodge,<br/>
parry, block and simply have the HPs to *take* quite a bit more damage than<br/>
I do.  That&#39;s what they&#39;re for.  If you&#39;ve got four frogs, one engaged and<br/>
three standers-by, then with your 50% resist rate that you quoted, you&#39;ve<br/>
got two frogs pounding you constantly.  I&#39;d survive 10-12 rounds with buffs<br/>
and some lucky rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if you have two or more tanks in your group then the mana of the<br/>
cleric is better spent (i.e. better mob damage/damage taken ratio) to have<br/>
let the tanks have done the tanking.  What I&#39;m saying is that you may do<br/>
(and I&#39;m just pulling numbers out of thin air here) 200 points of damage to<br/>
a frog while you&#39;ve taken 400 points of damage, wheras a tank will have done<br/>
400 points of damage to a frog and have taken, say, 400 himself.  So if the<br/>
cleric heals you both, the cleric has burned the same amount of mana for 200<br/>
points of damage from you and 400 from the warrior.  I realize that it&#39;s not<br/>
always this clearcut, and I don&#39;t mean to diminish the amount of damage that<br/>
bards do, it&#39;s not insignificant.  From the Brian Hook post:<br/>
<br/>
The melee classes are arranged such that, from greatest damage to least<br/>
damage, the ideal layout is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1.) monk<br/>
2.) warrior/rogue<br/>
3.) shadow knight/paladin/ranger<br/>
4.) bard<br/>
5.) cleric/shaman/druid<br/>
6.) pure casters<br/>
<br/>
This is the order in which the players should stand from the battle.<br/>
Lullaby puts you at #1 with every non-engaged mob.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As for Lullaby, Enchanter Mesmerize is better, but if I&#39;m not in<br/>
&gt; a group with<br/>
&gt; Mes, it&#39;s still darned useful.  In Lower Guk (savant, exe, scribe<br/>
&gt; rooms), at<br/>
&gt; level 34, I was getting about 50% resists.  This shuts down half<br/>
&gt; of the goblins<br/>
&gt; in excess of the one targetted (assuming that the group is smart<br/>
&gt; enough to<br/>
&gt; target one at a time).  In a four-goblin pull, that neutralizes<br/>
&gt; one and a half<br/>
&gt; goblins.  (This is the equivalent of Pixie Striking each of the<br/>
&gt; MOBs, without<br/>
&gt; all of the annoying retargeting).  With more targets, it&#39;s even better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To show how situational this is:  1) it&#39;s not worth it if you<br/>
&gt; only have two<br/>
&gt; targets, and Pixie Strike might be better for three; 2) if you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; Cleric, you&#39;ll probably die; 3) if the dungeon is empty of other<br/>
&gt; players, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t sing AE songs unless we&#39;re close to a zone point.<br/>
