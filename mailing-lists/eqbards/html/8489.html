<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020205334">ACK!!  That&#39;s a great trade for sure!  I&#39;m level 28, and I have 1000 pp in<br/>
the bank, just waiting to buy a drum.  And I STILL haven&#39;t gotten one.  :)<br/>
Consider yourself extremely lucky!  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Of course now, that 1000pp will probably start going toward lambent<br/>
armor.  Maybe I&#39;ll just have to pry the drum out of the cold dead hands of<br/>
the princess myself one of these days.<br/>

&gt;But lo and behold she said she would trade!  We met in the W. Commonland<br/>
&gt;Druid ring and traded.  I equipped it, and ZOOOOM!!!!! Off I went, wow, I am<br/>
&gt;still amazed at the speed.  At 13 I can outrun people in JBOOTS, and have<br/>
&gt;outrun people with SOW.  Its absolutely amazing how much ground I can get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, thats my tale.. hope it was entertaining.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S. To date I have been able to save myself and 3 other people in<br/>
&gt;situations where SELO alone wouldnt have done it.<br/>
