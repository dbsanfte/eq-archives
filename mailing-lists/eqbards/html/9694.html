<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-176347951">Personally I don&#39;t buy the Bards are a good class.. I would find it more to the point bards are a neutral class.  I personally think it&#39;s a premise failure on the part of the EQ staff, not that this is a bad thing or a fault thing.  Here they implemented a series of choices with the bards, which for the most part put them in the &quot;classic celtic&quot; definition of the bard.  But then didn&#39;t set the game mechanics to support it.  Case in point bards are the ONLY ones (to my knowlege) who can worship Veeshan, and this makes sense in two ways.. one bards are supposed to be the lore keepers and entertainers of Norrath Veeshan having brought the first life would likely want someone to keep note of what was going on with her children, the powers of the bard are vocal in nature.. (even with instruments) closest a mortal is going to get to dragonbreath.  However there is no temple of Veeshan, Dragons will still go after the bard as readily as anyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
They give us the power of viewing lore Items or allowing others to,  But haven&#39;t done much to see that it NEEDS to be done.  We are officially the mail deliverers but anyone can do it.  There aren&#39;t really many bard lore quests, which I personally think there should be.. What I would love to see is having to get a series of parchements that have a song over and above the 50 that has some real special power.. like.. getting the 18 parts of the song of creation (the tale of how Veeshan started all life on Norrath for example) and get the power to teleport to anywhere in Norrath just as an idea.<br/>
<br/>
My point I guess isn&#39;t that a dark elf bard would be a bad idea.. just that it would then have to have the same factions as the other bards have in the current game setup, personally I think they should adjust faction that bards start as tolarated in any zone.. after all even the bad guys like to have their ego&#39;s stroked.<br/>

&gt; I asked Brad this one day in the chat room and he said that Bards are a<br/>
&gt; good class, that is way there are no evil Bards. Specificly I asked why<br/>
&gt; Teir&#39;dal could not be bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Good point, it would quite amusing seeing Troll and Ogre &quot;Musicians&quot; (not<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards).<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can&#39;t see why Verant don&#39;t have evil bard types, musicians in battles<br/>
&gt; &gt;were used to raise troops moral and get a good marching beat, are Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;saying that Trolls/Ogres don&#39;t go into war?<br/>

&gt; &gt;I still maintain that we bards were never meant to get imbrued armor for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;simple fact imbrued means &quot;stained&quot;, as in soaked and stained - I pictured<br/>
&gt; &gt;it as going to SKs, maybe rogues, whereas lambent means shimmering or<br/>
&gt; &gt;radiant, far more appropriate for us goodie-two-shoes bards.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This brings up another minor rant I have... where are the evil bards?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Surely the bad guys have singers of villainy and strife.  The lizard men<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be a great concession on that, given we already have their scout<br/>
&gt; &gt;fifes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just by way of humor, can you imagine a troll bard?  Even better: a troll<br/>
&gt; &gt;bard doing the happy dance? :)<br/>
