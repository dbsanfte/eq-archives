<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035777075">Hi - I am level 8 and a bit.  Equip a drum and play Selo&#39;s  when you run and<br/>
you&#39;ll go as fast as you can.  I think you can go faster as you get older so<br/>
each level up will add to your speed.  Were you grouped with your friend?<br/>
Did he cast SoW (Spirit of the Wolf - I think 8 is too low for him to be<br/>
able to cast it) or have it on him and was grouped with you?  If so, I would<br/>
think that his natural ability plus the Sow and your Selo&#39;s would make him<br/>
really fast.  Also check your run/walk button - I always forget mine when I<br/>
break camp.<br/>

		Some of the smaller races have REALLY high dex, which makes<br/>
them naturally<br/>
		faster - but they shouldn&#39;t outrun you with Acc. on.<br/>
<br/>
		Uhhh, you are RUNNING right, not the default walking? (Note:<br/>
I HATE THAT -<br/>
		everyone runs, why is WALK default?) The only place I&#39;ve<br/>
been to so far<br/>
		that would be a good idea to walk in is kelethin. Probably<br/>
others that are<br/>
		narrow and cliffy - but geeze.<br/>
