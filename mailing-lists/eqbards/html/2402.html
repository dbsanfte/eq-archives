&gt; I was wondering why this skill wasn&#39;t listed at the other trainers. I<br/>
&gt; finally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have to train it<br/>
&gt; with Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>
&gt; Well I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or something and<br/>
&gt; skip by it in the list? It should come after the Hand to Hand and Hide<br/>
&gt; skill in alphabetical order, correct? I also scrolled through the entire<br/>
&gt; list of skills and still didn&#39;t find it listed anywhere. I also left him<br/>
&gt; and came back several times and still didn&#39;t see it listed.<br/>
&gt; Ah well, maybe like I said, I&#39;m just dense and managed to scroll past it<br/>
&gt; 5 times without ever seeing it. I suppose I&#39;ll check again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re in the right place.  The skill may be called &quot;Intimidation&quot; though, I<br/>
can&#39;t remember.  I know it was either labelled that or that was what he said<br/>
to me when I trained in it.  Perhaps both.<br/>
