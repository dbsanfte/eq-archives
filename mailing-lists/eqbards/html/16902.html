<div id="ygrps-yiv-538505957">Okay - I can&#39;t believe Verant got to Onelist *chuckles* but apparently, <br/>
they added a new undocumented feature called Family Filter, which basically <br/>
blocks any emails that contain &quot;inappropriate language&quot; (shades of <br/>
aol!!).  Onelist didn&#39;t bother to tell anyone about this, they just added <br/>
it  and turned it on for every subscriber.<br/>
To turn it off, you need to go to the Home tab once you have signed in to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com/.">http://www.onelist.com/.</a> If you look where you would normally search for a <br/>
list, above the box is a little &quot;Family Filter On&quot; title... Click it and <br/>
that takes you to a page with a check box.  Unmark it and click &quot;Done&quot;.<br/>
