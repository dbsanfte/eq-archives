<div id="ygrps-yiv-387996841">Good suggestions Tszaaz.  I tried those and got discouraged.  Maybe I should<br/>
try again.  The problem I&#39;ve been having with the damage shields is that the<br/>
mobs seem to take less damage than from Bellow even when we are fighting one<br/>
at a time.  With multiple mobs Psalm is awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
At what point do mobs start attacking more often?<br/>
<br/>
Is Largo&#39;s safe in Dalnir&#39;s?  I was hesitant to use it given the three<br/>
levels in Dalnir&#39;s.  Has anyone else had this song causing mobs to teleport<br/>
to them or cast on them from different levels?<br/>

nature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With 4 tanks you could be singing:<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth<br/>
Chant of Battle<br/>
Fufils<br/>
<br/>
which would give a damage shield, AC, Dex, Str, DoT and lower the mobs<br/>
resist all while wailing away on the front line. Sounds pretty useful to me!<br/>
<br/>
hitting 32 will change a LOT, but still, there is a lot you can add to a<br/>
group before then.<br/>
