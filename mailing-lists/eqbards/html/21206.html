<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278636122">Gullerback is still a very common spawn - rumor is that he&#39;s the placeholder<br/>
for Az... a named wurm for the Wurmslayer quest.<br/>
<br/>
I had no problem taking Gullerback down in a group with a 52 Mage, 49<br/>
Paladin, 50 Druid, and me (45? at the time).  We continued to fight him when<br/>
the Druid left - we got him once - and then died the second time when he<br/>
summoned the Mage.<br/>
<br/>
We all got our mantles...<br/>

crescendo is actually less haste than celerity by a little.  if your tanks<br/>
already have a haste item, use crescendo because their haste will max<br/>
anyway, and AC+STR is better than +AGI.<br/>
<br/>
for a mantle, if you like ac (and hit points are nice too) go to burning<br/>
woods and grab a tattered mantle.  gullerback is 50+ so you may not be able<br/>
to kill him, but the people in the zone may let you loot one, or like you<br/>
said the guild can go kill him.  he used to be extremely common when kunark<br/>
came out, dunno if they changed that, but he drops the mantle everytime.  if<br/>
buying they are cheap anyway, i think 200-ish.  it is ac12 20hp 10disease.<br/>
<br/>
for a cloak, you can&#39;t get up to an HBC or cloak of shadows with that amount<br/>
yet, but a simple upgrade to your cloak is either white-wolf hide,<br/>
lizardscale, or even a cloak of the icebear, which is the highest ac and<br/>
cheapest of the 3.<br/>
<br/>
for belt, i don&#39;t think you will find higher ac, or at least can&#39;t think of<br/>
one.<br/>
