<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067155129">Don&#39;t know if anyone said this yet, but this song strikes me as eing<br/>
awfully similar to the Jedi mind trick. This is what happened to me:<br/>
<br/>
I was in Kelethin talking to the dwarf who you give bandit tongues to.<br/>
He asked if I was a member of 628. I said, &quot;I am a member of 628.&quot; He<br/>
said, &quot;Sorry friend, but I can&#39;t trust you yet...&quot; I sand him a song,<br/>
and said, &quot;I am a member of 628.&quot; He said, &quot;Then it is my duty to tell<br/>
you of the guild tasks.&quot; Something like that. Made me laugh anyway...<br/>

I have found that the most usefull aspect of the level 11 song is its<br/>
ability<br/>
to grant the singer quests.  Using this song I can attempt or recieve<br/>
any good<br/>
aligned races/classes quest.  I have tried this in several cities and<br/>
know that<br/>
it is the truth. I try and hail the person, talk a bit and they give a<br/>
&quot;once<br/>
you are in better standing then we will talk&quot; message.  Sing the level<br/>
11 song<br/>
then repeat the last quest cue.  Voila! instant quest. :)<br/>
