<div id="ygrps-yiv-412609860">Going back to the hybrid discussion, it is my contention that, by <br/>
Verant&#39;s definition:<br/>
<br/>
Compared to casters, hybrids should have better melee and worse casting.<br/>
Compared to meleers, hybrids should have worse melee and better casting.<br/>
We are a hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
For true class balance, the melee + casting component for all classes <br/>
should be equal, but the above must at the very minimum be true.<br/>
<br/>
For the cost of a material component and fifteen seconds sitting plopped <br/>
on their butts, Necromancers, Magicians and arguably Enchanters have <br/>
better melee than we do, for as long as they are able to keep their pets <br/>
alive.  So we fail the definition automatically.<br/>
			<br/>
Verant has specifically made our songs weaker than the corresponding <br/>
spells cast by other classes (Lullaby is a prime example) because:  a) <br/>
they are the other classes&#39; specialties, b) our songs affect an entire <br/>
group, and hence our songs are &quot;more powerful&quot; than individual spells, <br/>
and c) our songs do not require mana and hence can be cast indefinitely.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, we can keep at *most* three songs going at a time, while many of <br/>
the clerics, shamans, druids and enchanters I know are capable of keeping <br/>
three (plus) buffs up on all party members while *also* casting combat <br/>
spells and healing (and, in many cases, meleeing better).  If we can cast <br/>
fewer songs/spells than these other classes, and those songs are weaker <br/>
than the other classes&#39; spells, and most of these classes are better at <br/>
melee than we are (either naturally or via pets), what use are we?<br/>
<br/>
Further, even at level 42, I find my song selection to be severely <br/>
constrained because many of our best songs are incompatable with spells <br/>
that other classes are casting.  And their&#39;s are better.<br/>
<br/>
I am frequently invited on guild events with the level 50s, but I <br/>
strongly suspect that they are using me as a cheap clarity fill-in.  <br/>
Especially since they are constantly sending /g Play Mana Song.  After <br/>
all, a level 42 does not steal very much exp from five level 46-50s, and <br/>
clarity is pretty useful *given that small exp sacrifice*, if no higher <br/>
level is available to fill slot 6. <br/>
<br/>
What happens when I get to level 50?  Can I in good conscience argue that <br/>
I am actually a useful party member?  It seems to me that the value of a <br/>
Bard shrinks as he approaches level 50, particularly if Harmonic is <br/>
correct and our MR songs are not really needed in Dragon/Planes raids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading a lot of posts on various boards where people discuss <br/>
their &quot;ideal&quot; party makeup.  Given that we are supposed to be the weakest <br/>
solo type and the strongest grouping type (correct?), one would expect a <br/>
Bard to be listed in one of the first few slots in most of these lists.  <br/>
And yet, not one of the lists I have seen included a bard *at all*.  Not <br/>
even when a list of alternates was given for slot 6.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that this is, in part, due to the fact that there are not very <br/>
many Bards (and why would there be, when there are so many much more <br/>
obviously powerful classes to choose from), and that it is in part due to <br/>
the fact that many Bards are clueless (at level 42, I am increasingly <br/>
surprised at the number of people who don&#39;t realize that we can twist <br/>
songs, for example).  Still, doesn&#39;t the fact that nobody who has posted <br/>
a list like this has bothered to name the Bard at all suggest something <br/>
about class balance?  Like, for example, we s**k?<br/>
<br/>
I need reassurance.  Wah!<br/>
