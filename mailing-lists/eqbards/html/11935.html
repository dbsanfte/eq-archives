<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834262152">It probably is. Anything involving camping IS taking advantage.<br/>
<br/>
In a REAL tabletop game, the game ending wouldn&#39;t keep the person <br/>
from being angry at you. But that is the difference between computers<br/>
and having real people involved.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I at first thought DT&#39;s where pretty stupid too, but if you read my<br/>
&gt;&gt; previous post, i think they where put in for a good reason, and <br/>
&gt;all in all,<br/>
&gt;&gt; it even makes sense. Armed with this knowledge, we cleared the <br/>
&gt;pof and only<br/>
&gt;&gt; had to camp out twice from DT&#39;s... where as before we where basically<br/>
&gt;&gt; getting the dt&#39;s 75% of the time. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What are people going to do when Verant decides camping to clear the<br/>
&gt;hate list is an exploit?<br/>
