<div id="ygrps-yiv-764309550">He just posted part 3 - and it&#39;s got a lot more Bard-related stuff in it.<br/>
Again, for those who&#39;d rather not web-surf, I&#39;ve cut some tasty bits below.<br/>

Anyway, is the Bard song Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby ever intended to be fixed? <br/>
It currently has  a 3 second duration and a roughly 60% resist rate. Even <br/>
those that are in favor of it the way it is admit that it requires a <br/>
dedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it.  One resist causes <br/>
the monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly interrupt the song, and <br/>
then the Bard is more or less dead because all the monsters are going to be <br/>
un-mesmerized in three seconds.<br/>
<br/>
**Don&#39;t know, sorry. That&#39;s definitely a GZ question.<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it intended that Bards don&#39;t get any magical instruments until mid <br/>
30s or higher?  If not, please examine the quests that give the <br/>
unfound/missing instruments, they may be broken.<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ll ask GZ.<br/>
<br/>
Abashi said players don&#39;t get indoor sow or selo&#39;s or any kind of speed <br/>
buff because in beta they caused a lot of trains. How about Mobs not <br/>
getting indoor sow etc? IMO sow&#39;d mobs cause more trains then any sow&#39;d <br/>
players. If it is just to prevent trains please remove the ability of mobs <br/>
to cast sow indoors.<br/>
<br/>
**I agree with Abashi, however that&#39;s not the biggest reason we don&#39;t allow <br/>
SOW indoors. The biggest reason is SOW and similar spells were originally <br/>
intended to only help with travel. They were not meant for kiting and such. <br/>
Since dungeons, relative to outdoor zones, are much smaller, we designed it <br/>
such that &#39;travel&#39; spells wouldn&#39;t work there.<br/>
<br/>
Is it within the vision to ignore all bard posts/concerns except the least <br/>
important for two months straight? So far we still don&#39;t have any class <br/>
specific weapons and only two non-planar, non-dragon instruments that have <br/>
an effect (and one is from Kedge and extremely rare).<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ll ask Abashi why he hasn&#39;t responded to &#39;bard posts&#39; if indeed truly <br/>
he hasn&#39;t.<br/>
