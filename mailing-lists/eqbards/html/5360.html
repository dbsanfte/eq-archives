&gt;I been auctioning one for the past 2 nights on Innoruuk - looking for 800pp<br/>
&gt;(will take less) or owner wanted a trade for a Staff of Writhing and 100p<br/>
&gt;-- so far - no takers - too many steins have been quested me thinks<br/>

plus 2 bits of bronze armour.  Did some negotiating with a mage type<br/>
who wanted to trade it for some gator armour, but since she&#39;d never<br/>
heard of the stuff (yes it&#39;s true) she asked for too much and think he<br/>
got huffed by that.  Oh well, he said he could pick one up for 600pp<br/>
in the auction easy.<br/>
