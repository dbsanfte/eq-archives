<div id="ygrps-yiv-373401198"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;- Wood Elves end up with better forage skill<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you played a wood elf bard to high levels?  Maybe it&#39;s just my <br/>
character that&#39;s glitched, but I found that forage and hide are buggy.  I <br/>
have never been able to train either of them past their starting values. <br/>
 As a bard I&#39;m supposed to be able to train forage at 12th level and hide <br/>
at 25th level, but they both said I&#39;d reached my maximum limit when I <br/>
reached those levels and attempted to train.  (I don&#39;t know the numerical <br/>
value, but it&#39;s very bad.)<br/>
