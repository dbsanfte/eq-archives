Here is my hot key &lt;1&gt; specifically for charming in outdoor zones:<br/>
<br/>
----------  ----------<br/>
| selos |  | charm |<br/>
----------  ----------<br/>
<br/>
----------  ----------<br/>
| attack | |  who   |<br/>
----------  ----------<br/>
<br/>
----------    ----------<br/>
| sense |  | track   |<br/>
----------    ----------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;attack&quot; is a social macro: /pet attack<br/>
<br/>
&quot;who&quot; is a social macro: /pet guard me  /pet who leader  /time (yes, 3<br/>
things stacked in one.  I use guard me to back off a pet who is agro on<br/>
party.  Yes, /pet backoff would work too but I also use charm to pull and I<br/>
want the spectre to path to me as soon and as close as possible.  The /pet<br/>
who leader is to tell my party I have a pet or to amaze lower levels with my<br/>
pet skellie or orc or bixie.  And /time is handy to see what time it is in<br/>
game day for Kith.  Tip: undead clerics make great pets.  Dont know if they<br/>
would heal the party but they are too cheap to symbol buff. So may as well<br/>
let the othe rmobs beat them down and let them burn their mana working for<br/>
the &#39;good guys.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;sense&quot; is sense heading ability<br/>
<br/>
&quot;track&quot; brings up tracking<br/>
<br/>
I use Instill Doubt to annoy others when I am in wolf-form.  You will get<br/>
the doggy barking and attack animation. Other than that, it&#39;s pretty much<br/>
useless to me.<br/>
