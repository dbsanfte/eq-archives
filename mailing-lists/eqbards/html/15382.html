<div id="ygrps-yiv-438604252">Read his message below and REPLACE PVP with DUEL.  This isn&#39;t a problem<br/>
specific to the PvP servers, but to PvP combat, which can take place on any<br/>
server via Duel.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the actual patch message from the patch server:<br/>
==================<br/>
- Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-spawn<br/>
with zero mana.<br/>
<br/>
This change was implemented to counter a strategy used by casters where<br/>
they would duel to reduce downtime between fights, thus allowing groups to<br/>
engage creatures that they normally would not be able to.<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
IMO, this isn&#39;t a nerf, but a fix of a loophole.<br/>

&gt; My problem with this explanation is that most other changes like this to<br/>
&gt; were done just to the PvP servers, not every server. Why was this done<br/>
&gt; to all the servers to address a problem specific to the PvP servers?<br/>
