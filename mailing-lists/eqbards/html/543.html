<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066350762">Actually camo does work occasionally. One time I chased a running mino<br/>
and accidently got charmed leading to my death. I came back, and asked a<br/>
friend to cast camo on me, and I went about my way using /corpse to pull<br/>
my body away from him. He never saw past me, and he didn&#39;t charm me. I<br/>
guess its just luck of the draw.<br/>

&gt; I should have explained about this:  Invis and Camo won&#39;t work.  Mordrath or his<br/>
&gt; pet or the guards or something can see invisible/camo&#39;d people.  I was told<br/>
&gt; Invis won&#39;t work, but I tried Camo myself and died for it 3 more times.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Assuming the dangerous creature near your corpse can&#39;t detect invisible<br/>
&gt; &gt; (?) the easiest way to get your corpse back is to find a kindly magic caster<br/>
&gt; &gt; type to make you invisible.  Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that button - and<br/>
&gt; &gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>
