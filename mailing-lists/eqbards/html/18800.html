<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000135190">yes it does work the same, but if a bard has to sing the song then they can<br/>
sing nothing else.  therefore having the spell or an item (fishbone earring,<br/>
singing steel gloves) is always used over the song.  the song should be<br/>
memmed for emergencies in underwater zones.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Being only level 14, I don&#39;t have the enduring breath song yet, but<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t it work like SoW?  If I&#39;m singing Selo&#39;s and someone tries to<br/>
&gt; cast SoW on a group member, it won&#39;t stick.  But if I stop singing,<br/>
&gt; and then they have SoW cast upon them, and then I start singing again,<br/>
&gt; the rest of the group gets Selo&#39;s, while the person SoW&#39;ed keeps his<br/>
&gt; SoW.  So assuming enduring breath works in the same way, if group<br/>
&gt; members get enduring breath cast on them before the bard sings his<br/>
&gt; song, they should be using the spell, while the bard is using the<br/>
&gt; song. </span></blockquote></div>
