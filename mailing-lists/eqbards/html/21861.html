&gt;Kaearia has a couple of comments in the thread.  Part of the one I referred<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve never felt any of the folks working on EQ were particularly strong in<br/>
&gt;the math department. I won&#39;t attribute to malice what can be explained by<br/>
&gt;stupidity. This game is going to be killed because of that stupidity once<br/>
&gt;some reasonable competition appears. I don&#39;t see much point in trying to<br/>
&gt;argue with a rock about esoteric game balance issues, and am just glad to<br/>
&gt;see some resolution of the less esoteric ones.<br/>
