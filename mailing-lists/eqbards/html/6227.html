<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a group these are all good spots:<br/>
<br/>
Erud&#39;s crossing, and make a good amount of cash if you do from wisps. (bound<br/>
in Qeynos)<br/>
<br/>
Lions in E. Karanas *yawn* or go after Gnoll Reavers. (bound in Highpass)<br/>
<br/>
Mammoth Calves, orcs and Ice Skellies in Everfrost.(bound in halas)<br/>
<br/>
Lizardmen in the temples of Feerot surrounding Cazic Thule Entrance, what a<br/>
blast, you will be sorry sorry sorry when you discover this place later and<br/>
realized you missed it.  It is the perfect adventure at your level. (bound<br/>
in the Arena)<br/>
<br/>
The Aviaks under the Aviak guards in Lake Rathetear, everyone is there for<br/>
the Aviak Guards and you shouldn&#39;t have to compete at all for the aviak<br/>
spawn. (bound in the Arena)<br/>
<br/>
There is no good reason to be funneled into all the old boring heavily<br/>
camped spots in Norrath at your level, there is LOTS of adventure.<br/>
