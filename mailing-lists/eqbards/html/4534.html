<div id="ygrps-yiv-730043251">Ummm... they do don&#39;t they?  The time taken to mem a song decreases as <br/>
     you go up in level.  At 18 meming accelerado is extremely fast while <br/>
     Denon&#39;s discord takes forever.  I&#39;m sure that by the time I&#39;m 40th DD <br/>
     will be just as fast.<br/>

Well, for mages (yes I have an enchanter too - funny how they seem to fill <br/>
the same slot in magic circles as we bards do) although I may have trouble <br/>
deciding - it is INFINITELY easier to memorize spells, than songs.<br/>
     <br/>
Since we never get meditiate - our songs mem as slowly as the day we get <br/>
them - THAT is a problem.<br/>
     <br/>
Besides the ONE song we have that DOES use manna, any reason they can&#39;t <br/>
make our songs faster as we progress in skill?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Actually, not true.  I also play an enchanter, and at only 8th level, he <br/>
&gt;already had problems deciding on what to memorize - and now having just <br/>
&gt;gotten 12th (but none of the spells - too poor), he&#39;s gonna be hard-pressed <br/>
&gt;to make his decision.  As it is, he&#39;s already juggling spell slots (3 <br/>
&gt;buffs, 2 slots), and he can never decide whether invisibility or gate is <br/>
&gt;more important.<br/>
