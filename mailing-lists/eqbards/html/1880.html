<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is something i have been wondering about, and i know we went over this,<br/>
but this statement brings it back to my attention.<br/>
<br/>
i hit for over 4* dmg with my demon claw and staff of writhing (for 23 dmg<br/>
with claw, 36 with staff).  my question is why, and this is just out of<br/>
curiousity.  is it STR (i heard that 100+ str gives you a bonus, but dont<br/>
know if that was for rogue only, who told me this), my level (i also heard<br/>
level 20+ gives you dmg bonus, but does it keep going up or just once you<br/>
hit 20), or weapon skill (having 1h slashing or 1h blunt maxxed at 200<br/>
skill)?  sorry to start this topic over again.<br/>
<br/>
i just got my crystalline blade yesterday but haven&#39;t used it yet, very<br/>
interested to see if i can hit for 45+ dmg, woohoo!<br/>
