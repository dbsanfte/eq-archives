<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362924268">First three dragon breaths combined did less than a bubble to me.  Sometime<br/>
after that I had a bunch of my buffs dispelled.  2 more breaths, ended the<br/>
battle with a bubble and a half of life.  Started with just over 2000 HP.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  At 220s resist, I never resisted DragonBreath once.  Each breath attack<br/>
  took 1 to 2 bubbles of life away from me at 2000+ hp.  If you do the<br/>
  math that&#39;s 400-800 dmg per breath.  My client wasn&#39;t bugged out,<br/>
  I wasn&#39;t getting display errors, I was actually taking that sort of<br/>
  magnitude of damage, so was everyone else in my party.<br/>
<br/>
  Dragon Breath is AE with diminishing damage from the epicenter.  I<br/>
  did notice that when I was blasted by AE in the king room, I barely<br/>
  lost any hp.  But since you&#39;re a bard, and you need to protect your<br/>
  party so you have to get right up in there (allbeit, a step away from<br/>
  the claws).<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not arguing that resistance isn&#39;t helping, I&#39;m arguing that <br/>
  even with strong resistances, DragonBreath isn&#39;t all or nothing,<br/>
  and it cuts deep when it hits, which is literally everytime.<br/>
<br/>
  I dueled a Magician for fun about a month ago, played elemental<br/>
  and guardian, and decided to let him nuke me until his mana was<br/>
  gone (hoping I&#39;d resist everything).  Hell I even had GRM from<br/>
  the enchanter with us.  That put my magic resistance way over<br/>
  250.  While he couldn&#39;t Malaisement me at all, his DD shocks<br/>
  penetrated hard.  It took him about 2/3&#39;s his mana to kill me<br/>
  with straight DD magic based, I never once resisted fully his<br/>
  DD spells.  They stuck for either a little dmg or full dmg.<br/>
  Maybe if I had my resistance lower, I would have taken full<br/>
  damage all the time, but with dragons even partial dmg is <br/>
  deadly.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not bucking the idea of resistance, I&#39;m not trying to disagree<br/>
  to disagree.  Everyone has jumped onto the resistance bandwagon,<br/>
  and think I&#39;m an idiot for questioning it.  But there is more than<br/>
  meets the eye in this game for sure.  Things have never worked the<br/>
  way we&#39;ve thought them to in the past, why would Verant make a game<br/>
  calculation that made sense now?  Having all those resist items when<br/>
  fighting a dragon would mean you&#39;d never die; they want you to die<br/>
  when doing dragons.  That much is apparent.<br/>
<br/>
  I still have more testing to do, I need more data.  PvP and NPC<br/>
  battles are two different beasts.  I don&#39;t know how people survive<br/>
  in dragon fights without a healer as 5 or 6 AE attacks will usually <br/>
  kill anyone, resistances or not.  If resistances were this definite,<br/>
  my last Vox party would have lost no more than one bubble during every<br/>
  breath attack.  Someone here said they only took 200 dmg at most,<br/>
  which is like half a bubble.  I never once saw anyone in my groups<br/>
  only lose half a bubble either of the two times I saw Vox.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve got more observing to do.  So far, my limited experience is<br/>
  not backing resistances.<br/>
<br/>
  Got the chance to watch the initial gathering on Vox last night.<br/>
  I saw no silver bracers (vox bracers), some people had helmets<br/>
  indicating no crown, and no bards were there.  I believe it was<br/>
  around 18-24 people, they creamed Vox hard FWIW.  No bards, heh.<br/>
<br/>
  I bet it&#39;s something like the INT/WIS fiasco.  Anything more than <br/>
  200 has no effect?  Or something like that?  I bet as long as you<br/>
  have a 100 resistance in something, you&#39;ll get the partial/full<br/>
  dmg that you would at 200 or 300.  I&#39;ve never been feared by<br/>
  anything at 90 magic, hmm, so why have 200? hehe.<br/>
