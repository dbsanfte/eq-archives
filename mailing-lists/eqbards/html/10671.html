   Monks way outdmg Warriors, there is no competition.<br/>
   would have to flee.  You completely underestimate the<br/>
   power of monks (yes, at lower levels its not that obvious).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take your word for it.  My friend who has a 35th monk on Sol Ro is<br/>
always complaining the warrior with the executioner axe is outdamaging him.<br/>
At 18th level in our group the warrior dual wielding Langseaxe and I forget<br/>
what sure seems to outdamage our monk.  Maybe it gets better later on.<br/>

   You are absolutely right, there is a huge gap in weapons.  Then<br/>
   again you&#39;ve been spoiled by a mature server.  No one would dream<br/>
   of trying to kill Mucktail to get the PGT at level 12, let&#39;s be<br/>
   realistic.  Bonecracker and his necro horde kicked my ass in a full<br/>
   group at level 20.  One handed silvery axe and Dirk is what I used<br/>
<br/>
   We do need more weapons that are midrange and even highrange.<br/>
   have two Yks now, and yeah they proc alot, and yeah they do<br/>
   nice dmg, but that ranger beside me is kicking my butt in dmg<br/>
   ratios, and the monk is absolutely blowing me away.<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
	Have to agree.  I hardly expect a PGT at 12th though.  At 17th would<br/>
be possible, and we took down bonecracker at 19-22 group, but we were<br/>
careful and lucky.  Still neither of those weapons is appreciably better<br/>
than the dirk if at all.  On an immature server the gap is even more<br/>
ridiculous.  A level 5 paladin or cleric can get a 6/28 weapon that procs<br/>
Cleanse without killing anything except some green bixie drones.  A warrior<br/>
that can kill orc legionnaires (9-13th group?) can get a battle bunker<br/>
blade.  Without the higher levels selling down on their weapons the gap is<br/>
even more immense.  Our group can take Lockjaw at 20ish no way we could<br/>
acquire any of the comparable 1HS weapons in the game.  The gap is indeed<br/>
enormous and could easily be filled if Verant had any desire to do so.<br/>
Obviously someone out there is writing quests as new ones pop up all the<br/>
time.  Paladins get a new holy weapon quest, we get another fed ex<br/>
messenger.  That&#39;s balance for you.<br/>
