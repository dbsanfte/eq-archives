<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-520208274">aye bards are extremely powerful in duels, but only against casters.  sure<br/>
we can kite or fear/chain melee classes, but i avoid those kind of tactics<br/>
in duels.  in fact a shaman refused to duel me if i fear/chained him (i did<br/>
that to him once before), so i just beat him normally hehe.  but my record<br/>
in duels is very skewed whether talking about melee classes or casters.  if<br/>
i can remember, i am 10-2 against casters and 0-4 against melee.  we have<br/>
far too many resources against casters, and far too little tanking ability<br/>
against melee classes.<br/>
<br/>
our magic resistance songs negate almost any fear or root type spells, and<br/>
our magic/fire/cold resistances greatly reduce damage taken.  as well pixie<br/>
strike is the great interrupter (when it works).  caster with a pet?  fear<br/>
or charm the pet and it&#39;s out of the fight.  strangely, though they changed<br/>
charm to not be able to work on pets with masters that are still alive, it<br/>
still seems to work, even though i get a message to the contrary when i try.<br/>
<br/>
after recently acquiring some new armor/weapons/instruments i really would<br/>
like to retry against some melee classes.  maybe will see who i can talk<br/>
into it tonight.<br/>
