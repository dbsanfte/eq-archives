<div id="ygrps-yiv-802031644">I went from 22 to 25 in 4 days fighting in lake rathe. ok, mostly on DW<br/>
pets which are not AS common now, but i also fought aviak guards. there<br/>
are several places you can solo in lake rathe, and also som good group<br/>
spots.<br/>
<br/>
I thought i would have to stop with aviaks at 24th, but i still got xp<br/>
from them at 25th, even though some of them were green. You may say that<br/>
fighting greens is not good use of time, but aviaks come in 2 main<br/>
varieties, that i can tell, the 18-19 version and the 20-21 version.<br/>
they basically spawn 50-50. So i was fighting a blue 75% of the time and<br/>
a green giving xp 25% of the time. Almost no down time also. And decent<br/>
loot, up to a plat in coins, a rare bronze weapon and occasional word or<br/>
rune.</div>
