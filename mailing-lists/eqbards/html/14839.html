&gt; for him to stay feigned without the giant&#39;s hp being set back<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I chalk that tactic up to the likes of kiting.  It&#39;s true that<br/>
  the monk could feign out of the battle to survive, but on a<br/>
  successful feign the giant is going to utilize rapid npc non-<br/>
  combat regen.  I don&#39;t doubt the power of any of the classes<br/>
  I&#39;m mentioning, I&#39;m debating the con scale in that what is <br/>
  easy for one, isn&#39;t very easy at all for another.  It&#39;s unheard<br/>
  of for an aforementioned class to solo a giant with any success<br/>
  based on only their skills alone.  Reward vs. Risk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
  exist in this game.<br/>
<br/>
  I think the monk would be the worst off because while he/she would<br/>
  take the giant&#39;s hp down rapidly, he/she couldn&#39;t absorb the extreme<br/>
  dmg output.  Even with mend, I think a feign/mend attack would be<br/>
  a big /yawn, and possibly impossible due to regeneration of the npc.<br/>
  A warrior could get lucky and pull it off.  A paladin could get lucky<br/>
  too with LoH.  A ranger could dot and snare and bow kite the thing,<br/>
  but toe to toe the ranger doesn&#39;t have the hp/ac a warrior does.<br/>
  <br/>
  Thus, we are illustrating the disadvantage of making level based<br/>
  experience dependacies.  If a L30 deepwater goblin can tear me up<br/>
  or a L31 cyclops can smoosh me, I&#39;d better be rewarded in some way.<br/>
  Even caster npcs hit with the precision of a melee based npc and<br/>
  on top of that they cast spells too.  If a L50 wanted to sit and<br/>
  kill clops all day I think they should gain some fraction of<br/>
  experience.  No other game I&#39;ve seen employs the &#39;you are too high<br/>
  to receive exp reward&#39; from killing npcs that are lower level than<br/>
  the player. <br/>
<br/>
  I think part of the deeper problem in Everquest is the exp system<br/>
  in itself.  They don&#39;t show any numbers to justify any earnings, so<br/>
  in essence they can pull the wool over our eyes and we simply do<br/>
  not know what is going on.  All the muds I&#39;ve played on and coded<br/>
  on have npc level and npc experience as two completely separate<br/>
  variables.  If I wanted to kill L1 snakes all day I&#39;d only get<br/>
  1 or 2 xp from them every kill, if I fought a seafurry clops I&#39;d  <br/>
  get like 1,000 xp.  The consider/level based decision on whether<br/>
  you will earn the experience an npc gives is just not working<br/>
  to the player&#39;s advantage.  I understand the reasons they went<br/>
  with the existing structure, but making such a definitive line<br/>
  where exp is cut off makes the whole system less realistic. A<br/>
  L50 bard player should still receive combat experience from a <br/>
  L30 monster.  A L50 druid player should not, for example.  <br/>
  They&#39;ve made solo friendly classes, and a bard is not solo <br/>
  friendly but rather very group dependant, which I understand.  <br/>
  However, if I solo a cyclops that&#39;s a pretty big feat for me being <br/>
  a bard, and I&#39;ve probably invested some time and a lot of risk.  <br/>
  I would like some reward for that.<br/>
<br/>
  In Verant&#39;s struggle to balance the classes between each other,<br/>
  they failed to recognize that the player classes are not balanced<br/>
  versus npcs at all.  It&#39;s not that a warrior is too weak, or a<br/>
  wizard is too strong, Verant simply didn&#39;t consider player and<br/>
  npc combat.  Because PaladinA thought DruidB was too powerful<br/>
  and gaining levels too quickly, Verant steps in.  The programmers<br/>
  never looked at it like PaladinA versus NPC, and DruidB versus NPC.<br/>
  Classes began to target each other in attacks, and now we&#39;ve got<br/>
  a highly unbalanced PC/NPC exp growth system.<br/>
<br/>
  Everything worked in the beginning, and it was pretty.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
  matter if my L50 bard can outduel a L50 warrior or L50 wizard, it&#39;s<br/>
  just the fact that I don&#39;t stand a chance against handfuls of low lvl<br/>
  npcs that bothers me.  My bard turned out nothing like what I <br/>
  expected.  It&#39;s sad too.  As a class on the whole, we&#39;ve been<br/>
  overlooked, stepped on, ignored and made promises - but in the<br/>
  end I don&#39;t see a L50 bard as the stable and robust class I thought<br/>
  it would be.  <br/>
<br/>
  If I had my 4 missing songs, and if Hymm healed 30-40 hp, and if<br/>
  charm worked up to L45 even, and if Lullaby worked liked it used<br/>
  to, and I could load up on CHA gear / toss a flute in my hand and<br/>
  pixie strike anything with noticable accuracy --- I would be a much<br/>
  happier bard.  When CHA doesn&#39;t make much difference... When my flute<br/>
  doesn&#39;t do anything noticable... When I wish I could use some of those<br/>
  old songs that worked so well back then... I wonder what Verant&#39;s<br/>
  vision for the class is and why anyone would want to deal with this<br/>
  kind of frustration.<br/>
