<div id="ygrps-yiv-667803838">Greetings Ranian!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!  <br/>
<br/>
I too ventured to the Estate of Unrest seeking fame and fortune and I was<br/>
about your age during my first adventures there.  It was not a very happy<br/>
experience for me but I did learn some valuable lessons:<br/>
<br/>
1.	You need a good group to go to hard places.<br/>
2.	Unrest is a hard place.<br/>
3.	Your group needs a serious healer.<br/>
4.	Strange stuff happens - deal with it!<br/>
<br/>
It cost me my life several times to learn those lessons.  At lo 20&#39;s we&#39;d<br/>
hug the wall and try to pull from the house.  The &quot;yard trash&quot; is plentiful<br/>
and aggressive at that level.<br/>
<br/>
By level 25, I had gotten into &quot;the good regular group&quot; - we were co-level,<br/>
well balanced class wise and had an excellent cleric.  We were able to take<br/>
and hold both the Barroom (2nd floor) and the Knight Room (3rd floor) and we<br/>
had a much happier time there.  Mid 20&#39;s prolly can&#39;t hold the barroom if<br/>
the knight room is not camped.  But it usually is so if the barroom is open<br/>
- go for it.  No matter what - weird things happen - the hags cast thru the<br/>
floor and you take damage when they are fiting above you.  You get occasion<br/>
visit from the upstairs mobs so you may even see the knight appear in the<br/>
barroom.  By 27, you will welcome this sight! <br/>
<br/>
But the normal boss in the barroom is the unded-barkeep.  He is the one you<br/>
seek. You will need to be in a lo to mid 20&#39;s group for success in than<br/>
room.  You can work your way up by joining the groups that park along the<br/>
outside wall and pull things from the house.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun,<br/>
<br/>

		Having just obtained the 20th song for a bard I am getting<br/>
that wonder lust<br/>
		feeling again. I have<br/>
		explored all of the Karana&#39;s and they have been good to me<br/>
but alas it is<br/>
		time to move on.<br/>
<br/>
		I hear in a far off land of a place called the Estate of<br/>
Unrest. Sounds<br/>
		delightful. I am particular<br/>
		interested in aquiring the fabled Opalline Earings. Can<br/>
anyone give<br/>
		information on who I need to<br/>
		&quot;persuade&quot; in to letting me have a pair?<br/>
<br/>
		Thank you all<br/>
