<div id="ygrps-yiv-989463884">Some news from Inny...<br/>
<br/>
Elyana, btw, is an awesome bard/player/person and has been barding on Inny<br/>
from the get go.  Imho, no one could be more deserving of such prestigious<br/>
awards.  I have enjoyed hours with her both role playing (and she is one of<br/>
the very best in this realm) and working hard for exp (like when she needed<br/>
just one more bub to go to the planes for the first time.)<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations Elyana of Qeynos!!!<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Innoruuk] The gaining of a name!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TOday I was one of a fortunate six who were in the right place at the right <br/>
time. I was working on my smithing in Qeynos when a Crier shouted that the <br/>
Antonius Bayle had put a price on the head of Mordavin, the Archpriest of <br/>
the Bloodsabres. Vegalys was to head the hunt for him and bring him in for <br/>
trial for his henious crimes, treason murder and more!<br/>
I gathered Arolpin, Snip, Noraa, Rizzlerun and Sechan in my group. We <br/>
learned from Vegalys that Mordavin has been seen in East Karana, and Sechan <br/>
gated us there. Then we were off! We who had the ability to track soon found<br/>
<br/>
him at a farmhouse near the mountain foothills. We confronted him and <br/>
demanded he surrender. He refused at first so we attacked! Now mind you <br/>
though he was less then my own 52 summers he was at least 49! Icecomets flew<br/>
<br/>
from Snips fingers while I sang three chants bound to destroy any clerics <br/>
concentration. He finally surrendered for we were a force too mighty for him<br/>
<br/>
to overcome! Firmly bound (and gagged) he was taken back to Qeynos. Once <br/>
there Vegalys awarded us for our valour. I believe Snip gained a book,  <br/>
Sechan a diamond studded cap. For myself, there was two giftings. First, the<br/>
<br/>
shield of Antonius Bayle himself! Tis AC 75, an old family heirloom which i <br/>
will never allow to drop for tis bound to me by magic. In addition I was <br/>
awarded a title. No longer shall I be known in the realm as Elyana Shimada. <br/>
I am henceforth Elyana of Qeynos! Needless to say I got rip roaring drunk in<br/>
<br/>
celebration. Then I went back to my forging.. somehow the pounding of steel <br/>
seemed to lessen my headache =P<br/>
