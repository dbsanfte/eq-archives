like twinking are just jealous of them.  Twinkers are unable<br/>
to see (or incapable of grasping the concept) that they are<br/>
hastening the demise of the in-game item/gold economy and<br/>
monster/player balance that Verant has worked to maintain, and<br/>
thus conclude that they are innocent and people who don&#39;t like<br/>
twinking are at fault.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the meta-issue that causes this problem in the first<br/>
place is that Verant hasn&#39;t realized they need better money<br/>
sinks, and some type of item sink.  Stuff needs to wear out<br/>
and be consumed, otherwise a year or two down the road, we&#39;re<br/>
going to need a world reset.<br/>
