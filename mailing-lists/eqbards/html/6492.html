&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have read several postings on this instrument and<br/>
&gt; asked people in-game.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;The postings and opinions have not been consistent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I now have one and I am told it increases non-self<br/>
&gt; healing rate.  I plan to <br/>
&gt; &gt;test this tonight; I am interested in others&#39;<br/>
&gt; experiences as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My primary question though is: what is it worth? <br/>
&gt; Has anyone bought one, <br/>
&gt; &gt;sold one, or seen one bought or sold?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have one also.  I havent seen any difference<br/>
&gt; between it and a regular <br/>
&gt; lute.  (they weigh the same, appear to do exactly<br/>
&gt; the same thing)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps, as has been suggested here in the past, it<br/>
&gt; is a quest item? <br/>
&gt; However, the description doesnt say LORE ITEM on it.<br/>
&gt; Maybe Verant hasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; implemented what it is supposed to do into the game<br/>
&gt; yet? When you test it, <br/>
&gt; could you please post the results here?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was given mine by a guildmate, but I have seen<br/>
&gt; them for trade only on <br/>
&gt; Povar. (although I admit, being poor right now, I<br/>
&gt; usually ignore the auction <br/>
&gt; channel)<br/>
