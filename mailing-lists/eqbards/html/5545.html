<div id="ygrps-yiv-853368819">Here&#39;s a story of what happened to me my during my first visit to wisp<br/>
island in Erud&#39;s Crossing.  When I got on the island there was no one else<br/>
there.  I explored it but soon realized that I wasn&#39;t much for me to do on<br/>
the island.  The kerrans were all either blue or green and conned<br/>
indifferently to me.  I had no reason to attack them so decided to just wait<br/>
for the next boat.  While I was waiting, I decided to attack some fire<br/>
beetles to pass the time.  I figured I could sell the eyes for some pocket<br/>
change.  To my surprise, every kerran on the island started racing towards<br/>
to punish me for attacking the fire beetles.  Knowing that I couldn&#39;t kill<br/>
them all, I pulled out the drum and started running around the island.  I<br/>
was able to outrun them and pretty soon every kerran on the island was<br/>
chasing me.  I was running so fast, I eventually started lapping the kerrans<br/>
at the end of the train.  Like Forrest Gump, I just kept on running.  After<br/>
about 30 or so laps around the island, I saw the boat approach the dock.  On<br/>
the next lap, I quickly jumped on the boat.  Fortunately for me, none of the<br/>
kerrans followed me onto the boat.  I guess there is some code in the game<br/>
that prevents mobs from getting on the boat.  After giving thanks to<br/>
Bristlebane, I quaffed a few Fierce Brews for the ride to Erudin.<br/>

&gt; the ability to travel rapidly?  I mean, I know Wizards and Druids have<br/>
&gt; their nifty traveling spells, and of course, Gate has it&#39;s uses, but let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; face it - isn&#39;t there joy in watching the ground sail beneath your feet,<br/>
&gt; knowing that you aren&#39;t limited by a set of coordinates to where you can<br/>
&gt; go?  The freedom to explore that REALLY dangerous place, knowing you can<br/>
&gt; outrun *almost* anything?  Let&#39;s hear some traveler&#39;s tales...<br/>
