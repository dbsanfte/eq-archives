<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461278943">Hail!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest that you stay in Misty until level 5 and you get Selos song for<br/>
speed running.  Then going to Qeynos will be a piece of cake - I even went<br/>
to the North Karana gypsy camp at like level 5.  Also, at level 3, you are<br/>
still a &quot;monster magnet&quot; and to get to Qeynos, you have to run by monsters<br/>
in a couple spots (as you get bigger than these monsters, they wise up and<br/>
ignore you but now they will attack on sight - which means as soon as you<br/>
can see their icon they can see you and want to et you.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting crappy prices from the halfling vendors, you could try the<br/>
vendors in Kithikor Wood.  There are 2 shops very close to the Rivervale<br/>
zone and your faction may be different with these folk since they are<br/>
hummies.  But again, until you get bigger, expect that monsters will view<br/>
you as a tasty treat and don&#39;t wander about in Kithikor.  You have to go<br/>
down the path a short way but no more than a hundred yards or so and you<br/>
will shops - one on each side of the road.  Kith is still one of the most<br/>
scary zones to me.<br/>
<br/>
But if you must go - heed the advice of others and go nekkid with your good<br/>
stuffs in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Find the tunnel in misty thicket that goes into the Runnyeye Mines - run<br/>
past the gobbies if they guard the entrance and zone in.  Now stay close to<br/>
the wall on the right and follow it thru to the platform - run the whole way<br/>
even if gobbies jump on you - take all right turns hug the wall and zone<br/>
into the Gorge of King Xorbb.  Check it out!  Some really big monsters!  But<br/>
to get past them, you climb the wall on the left side and follow the left<br/>
wall thru the gorge.  In a couple spots you will be forced down off the wall<br/>
and if you fall it will hurt bad. So be carefull on the turns and hug the<br/>
wall. If you are forced down look first to make sure the traffic is clear.<br/>
Then run hugging the wall until you can climb back up. Keep following the<br/>
left wall until you see the canyon that leads you out of the zone - you are<br/>
pretty much forced down at the end. Run to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Now you are in East Karana. Hug the zone wall on the right. Keep high on the<br/>
right until the river.  Keep and eye out for Broon - a big ol cyclops who<br/>
hangs by the river. Give him a wide berth but watch also for Gryffins<br/>
(flying monsters) and Gogrehounds and Plains cats.  Run parallel to the<br/>
river giving Broon a wide berth - to the big wooden bridge - cross it and<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
Now you are in North Karana.  Keep the river on your left and keep going<br/>
south until it starts to turn west.  At the river bend be ware of the<br/>
Raiders - they are bandits and will attack if you get too close.  Give them<br/>
a wide berth but keep the river on your left.  You will see a huge stone<br/>
bridge - remember this because you can run across if you need to zone (and<br/>
later you will prolly come back here for the Lute quest.)  But if you are<br/>
going to Qeynos - don&#39;t cross it but keep river on your left and run run run<br/>
until you zone.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh now West Karana, run huggin the river on your left - a long long long<br/>
run.  Past fisherman and womans two times and finally you see the Barbarian<br/>
fishing village.  Now you can turn north and follow zone wall north past<br/>
some towers keep them on your right and eventually a path that leads down a<br/>
canyon to the west --take it and run to the zone.  <br/>
<br/>
In Qeynos hills now and getting very close.  Follow the path giving the<br/>
bears and wolves and everything a wide berth.  At the milestone take the<br/>
fork to the west and run to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you are in North Qeynos - run down the path (hopefully not meeting<br/>
Fippy Darkpaw or the Queenie Klicknik) to the city guards & gates and when<br/>
you chat with the folk explain that you have just come from Rivervale -<br/>
certainly someone will bind you.  <br/>
<br/>
If you live on Innoruuk, give me a tell and I may be able to guide you if I<br/>
am not too far away or otherwise engaged in a party.<br/>

		Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
		I have one problem though ... none of the vendors like <br/>
		me.  Any npc that will sell to me looks at me <br/>
		&quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and <br/>
		found one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
		(couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my <br/>
		loot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even <br/>
		afford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit & <br/>
		patterns for example).<br/>
<br/>
		So I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale <br/>
		who will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t <br/>
		anyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move <br/>
		on to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from <br/>
		Rivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives <br/>
		the directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re <br/>
		not easily reversed.<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks again,<br/>
