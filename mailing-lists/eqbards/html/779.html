&gt; Just another little note to add.. SOW and Selo&#39;s stack VERY nicely.. For<br/>
&gt; that raw speed you just can&#39;t do without.<br/>

Selo&#39;s destroys Spirit of the Wolf&#39;s effect completely.  One pulse of<br/>
Selo&#39;s and everyone in your party who was in range has just had their<br/>
Selo&#39;s wiped away. Their SoW icon is still there, but the speed boost<br/>
from it is gone.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that EQ does is not let speed-related effects stack at<br/>
all.  If you have SoW, and you get rooted, SoW is gone.  If you are<br/>
rooted and sing Selo&#39;s or get SoW cast upon you, the root is gone.<br/>
