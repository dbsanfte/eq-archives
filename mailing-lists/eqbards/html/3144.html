<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443907519">Here is my 2 coppers since we are splitting hairs and most of us are just<br/>
trying to find something to do while we are sitting at work and killing time<br/>
while we wait to get home so that we can do what we really want to<br/>
do...which is play EQ.<br/>
<br/>
To me, while &quot;Weaving&quot; is justifiable and makes a lot of sense, it makes<br/>
more sense in the context of &quot;Songweaving.&quot;  Songweaving is definitely too<br/>
long and would never catch on as a quick method to describe the activity in<br/>
question.  Calling it &quot;Weaving&quot; for short seems too weak, and too close to<br/>
sounding like some sissy skill like &quot;Tailoring&quot; - i.e., &quot;oooooh, I am good<br/>
at weaving tonight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Medley, (if you will pardon my bluntness) is completely out of the question<br/>
and should not be brought up again.  I don&#39;t feel a justification for my<br/>
opinion on this is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Juggling seems the best candidate I have contemplated thus far partly for<br/>
the same reasons given by Jyzan below.  I feel like I am juggling when I am<br/>
performing the activity of keeping several song affects active at once.<br/>
Examine the following definition of the word &quot;juggle&quot; as it is derived from<br/>

responsibilities of family life and full-time job -- Jane S. Gould&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now take a look at the definition for &quot;Weave&quot; and tell me which one you<br/>
think suits this unique ability we Bards have better:<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, I don&#39;t mean to seem non-democratic, but I&#39;m always <br/>
&gt; going to refer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it as &quot;juggling&quot;, since that is what I&#39;ve always called <br/>
&gt; it, and what it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;really feels like I&#39;m doing while playing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So either we go along with you or continue to use different words.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had hoped we could perhaps come to agreement on this <br/>
&gt; topic.  If we have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; groundswell for &quot;juggling&quot; I&#39;ll concede, in the interest of <br/>
&gt; picking one word.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other than being used to it, do you have a reason to prefer <br/>
&gt; &quot;juggling&quot; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;weaving?&quot;  I&#39;d really rather be persuaded by compelling <br/>
&gt; argument instead<br/>
&gt; &gt; of ultimatum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t be disappointed if I don&#39;t use the term, there&#39;s <br/>
&gt; hundreds of bards who<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t even on the list who won&#39;t even know what we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The main reason I call it juggling is that that&#39;s what it <br/>
&gt; feels like I&#39;m doing,<br/>
&gt; clicking buttons left and right, trying to keep all the <br/>
&gt; effects happening.<br/>
&gt; Weaving sounds like too placid a term for such a hectic activity.  :)<br/>
