<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646587062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Over the last few weeks, Adagia&#39;s goal was to acquire a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
&gt;and to reach level 12 so she could finally sing Brusco&#39;s Boastful<br/>
&gt;Bellow.  Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in Crushbone was<br/>
&gt;finally answered, and last night she earned the right to scribe the<br/>
&gt;12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport home, and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;finding the adventures there entertaining, but she has suddenly found<br/>
&gt;herself without any burning immediate goals.  What excitement waits<br/>
&gt;for a Bard of 12 songs?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oops, one more. I LOVED hunting Blackburrow at 12, it is also great money<br/>
and exp. Selo&#39;s works (thank goodness as it is train central). make sure to<br/>
turn in all your gnoll fangs in Qeynos and then trade in the gems you get<br/>
for that for beer *grin* It makes gnoll fangs worth about 2 gold each as<br/>
well as good Quenos faction. That is all the hint you need to either figure<br/>
out the quests yourself or look em up on a spoiler site. Also, I THINK I<br/>
killed Gnasher for the first time around 12, not certain though, another<br/>
good quest.<br/>
