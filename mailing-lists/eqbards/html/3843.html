 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll take that long, by a large margin.  The number <br/>
of plats and items in a world (take Povar, one of the original<br/>
servers) doesn&#39;t grow linearly, until bulk of the population settles<br/>
on one level.  Lets throw some made up numbers out.  If the<br/>
pop. mean levels out at 30, and the std deviation is, say 5 levels,<br/>
then 95% of the population will be 20-40.  There is a LOT of <br/>
plat and magic items available to those levels.  Now, Verant said<br/>
6 mo. of playing would take a player to 50.  Given how wrong<br/>
they were, it seem likely to me that the pop. mean will level off at<br/>
a fairly high level well before the expansion, then just keep generating<br/>
plats and items, devaluing them until you simply won&#39;t see level<br/>
10&#39;s without full banded and nice toys.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is especially true of servers that were up from the start,<br/>
as there were tremendous money exploits that people took <br/>
advantage of to become master smiths, tremendously devaluing<br/>
banded armor.<br/>
<br/>
Also, that proliferation of high level, cheap loot will destroy any<br/>
usefulness that smithing and jewelcraft currently hold.  Forget<br/>
adding features to these skills (smithing weapons, magic weapons<br/>
and armor) as there will simply be no place for them in the<br/>
player economy.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that there not only needs to be item and money<br/>
sinks, but harder level limits on magic items.  I&#39;d also prefer to<br/>
see any magic weapon worth anything be useable by one<br/>
player only (like the no-drop what-zit 7/21 sword).  Personally<br/>
I think they should have put an owner field on the weapons,<br/>
and the first person who kills something with it is the only<br/>
one able to equip it.  This allows banking it, as well as having<br/>
a friend recover it from your corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing how easy it was for me to get my shaman to 6th<br/>
in a completely new zone, with no twinking, I think that<br/>
the next server that comes on-line, I&#39;ll start a new char<br/>
there.  At least some of the over-abundance of powerful<br/>
item will be eliminated, as the worst exploits have been<br/>
removed (I hope)</div>
