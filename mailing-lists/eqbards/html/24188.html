<br/>
What, of anything, we think or suggest has a chance to be implemented <br/>
regardless if WE thought it was balanced or not?  Why don&#39;t you wait <br/>
for someone to make a suggestion of what they think would make the <br/>
song useful, then you can rip apart the reasons why it would make us <br/>
overpowered in a non-uber raid environment.  You already started the <br/>
ball rolling with your suggestion of 1500 dd, castable every 3 <br/>
seconds.  Nice practice.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are saying that they would never, that&#39;s NOT EVER, mem <br/>
this song in ANY circumstance.  When we get to the &quot;Why?&quot;, the <br/>
answers are, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>
&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the mob <br/>
scaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s AE, and I&#39;d NEVER use an AE song.. The Chanter would kill me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is... &quot;What would have to change in order to justify <br/>
memming this song?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>
plays from 43 to 60.  I&#39;m talking about it becoming useful.. <br/>
occasionally, every once in awhile, rarely... something more than NOT <br/>
EVER.<br/>
