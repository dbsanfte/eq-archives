<div id="ygrps-yiv-785238537">Also the only way to get a true comparison is to have all three players<br/>
using the exact same weapons.  In pure melee damage output I would expect a<br/>
bard to be a close third to the SK being second.  Since even if your DW went<br/>
off as often as the SKs DA, the SK has bash and his second attack is not<br/>
with his nerfed left hand weapon.  The ranger would out pace both of you as<br/>
DW/DA is hard to compete with.<br/>

&gt; Our melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.  I back<br/>
&gt; this opinion up by this experience.  I was grouped at one point with a<br/>
&gt; ranger and a shadowknight.  We agreed to test out our melee skills,<br/>
letting<br/>
&gt; the monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any<br/>
abilities<br/>
&gt; except the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>
&gt; judges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>
&gt; night in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>
&gt; The shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>
&gt; the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bit misleading.  Your melee could be 95% that of the<br/>
ranger (and the SK&#39;s 101%) and you could get the same results.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be better off turning on all attack messages, then<br/>
parsing the file afterwards to figure out damage/sec and<br/>
damage_taken/sec figures.<br/>
