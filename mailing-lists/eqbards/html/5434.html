<div id="ygrps-yiv-394668463">I&#39;ve been wondering if there was anything of interest in the underwater <br/>
passageway.  I stumbled across it the other night and decided to check it <br/>
out.  OH BOY, I thought...adventure!  Hmmm.  I played it safe and swam along <br/>
the left wall the entire time...it&#39;s pretty dark down there.  I didn&#39;t find <br/>
the tower or any aqua-goblins, but from reading your post I guess that is <br/>
probably a good thing.  Has anybody killed the underwater goblins?  Seems <br/>
like they might have some pretty cool loot being in such a hard to reach <br/>
place.<br/>

&gt;Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;Speaking of Ghoulsbanes swords, my paladin husband has always maintained<br/>
&gt;that the sword casts it&#39;s spell more often based on the wielder&#39;s dex. <br/>
&gt;After<br/>
&gt;camping and finally getting these for 2 of the guild paladins (*sigh*, one<br/>
&gt;more to go), we went to lower guk for a break. It occurred to me to switch<br/>
&gt;from Anthem to Chant for the dex boost to see if that would get more casts<br/>
&gt;on the undead frogs. One paladin was pretty sure it did help. Since then,<br/>
&gt;they have debated whether to get dex boost items. The other paladin got <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;dex boosts later on and now thinks it makes no difference. The point of <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;ramble: when fighting undead with paladins using Ghoulsbanes, try Chant and<br/>
&gt;see if they think it helps the sword&#39;s casts.<br/>
&gt;I finally hit hell 1, L30 after many misadventures. Ever wonder what is in<br/>
&gt;the caves under the aviak guard island in Lake Rathe? I can confirm that<br/>
&gt;cave connects to the cave under the island straight out from the docks at<br/>
&gt;the Rathe Mountain zone pass. I can also tell you that L40ish spellcasting<br/>
&gt;deepwater goblins live in the tower in the cave underwater. Great place to<br/>
&gt;die. Fortunately, we did this exploration prior to me leveling. Not much<br/>
&gt;chance of a rez there, lol.<br/>
