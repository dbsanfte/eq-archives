<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048806113">I would be willing to hold one on The Rathe.  I&#39;m sure there are quite a few bards there that would join us.<br/>
First, I&#39;m sending a message to EQVault about it.  Hopefully the &quot;powers that be&quot; will notice and respond that it&#39;s a bug that will be fixed shortly, and not an intentional nerf.<br/>

&gt;Ok, people time to get organized like those monks on fennin ro!  The one<br/>
&gt;time monks get nerfed they get a two-page apology in the patch news the next<br/>
&gt;day, we get nerfed nearly weekly and get squat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would urge every single bard, regardless of level to /bug the new Levitate<br/>
&gt;results and /Feedback them as well every single time you log on to play.<br/>
&gt;Maybe several hundred /bugs and /feedbacks will get their F&%@in&#39; attention.<br/>
&gt;If not we should plan a Bard sit in like the monks had and see if a 50&#39;<br/>
&gt;gnome shows up for that.  If he doesn&#39;t its just one more thing we can throw<br/>
&gt;in their faces to prove that no one at Verant gives a Flotsam&#39;s A$$ about<br/>
&gt;bards and we are sick of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wasn&#39;t going to play tonite much do to having a hockey game, but I&#39;ll make<br/>
&gt;sure to get on just to /bug the new levitate issue.  Let&#39;s see some<br/>
&gt;solidarity out there!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kitasi<br/>
&gt; Now angrier than a scorned banshee and temporarily not questing on<br/>
&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>

&gt;&gt; I just pulled this off the usenet...can anyone test this out for those of<br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;&gt; who are at work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s busted, for sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Once you are levitating, the song will not take hold.  You have<br/>
&gt;  to fall first, before the next pulse will reactivate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Otherwise, yes, you get the:  You are already floating   message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The song no longer refreshed itself, wtf wasnt that change in the<br/>
&gt;  patch message?  Because it&#39;s a nerf, that&#39;s why =)  This does not<br/>
&gt;  impact casters whatsoever, it&#39;s aimed at bard&#39;s who can levitate<br/>
&gt;  continously higher and higher.  I bet some plat thats the reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>
