That happened to us too, damn funny!<br/>
<br/>
This weekend, a chanter&#39;s finger slipped and hit a 1 sec tashani spell or<br/>
something during buffing and guess who came out of the woodwork to lay the<br/>
smackdown on us :)<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Epic quest<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I almost got killed by Gorenaire when I was watching a guild <br/>
&gt; fight her. I <br/>
&gt; was totally unbuffed and when her AE hit me it dropped me <br/>
&gt; well under 30% <br/>
&gt; life so I hauled ass. =)  She cons kindly to me, and never <br/>
&gt; agrroed me. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; not sure what caused her to go aggro on you. During downtime <br/>
&gt; in VP some <br/>
&gt; friends of mine decided to duel (don&#39;t EVER do this in VP), <br/>
&gt; and Hoshkar, who <br/>
&gt; is kindly to me, stand right on top of me and kill them. His <br/>
&gt; AE hit me HARD, <br/>
&gt; but he walked away after my friends died w/out aggroing me. *shrug*<br/>

&gt; &gt;Side question about Gorenaire.  I was fighting along the <br/>
&gt; castle north wall<br/>
&gt; &gt;in Dreads when a Gorenaire raid was going on.  I conned the <br/>
&gt; dragon and I <br/>
&gt; &gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt;either warmly or amiable.  So I got close to take some <br/>
&gt; screenshots since<br/>
&gt; &gt;this was the first time I had ever seen a dragon.  I had <br/>
&gt; Selos up and was<br/>
&gt; &gt;standing right in front of Gorenaire when she decided to <br/>
&gt; swat me.  Before I<br/>
&gt; &gt;realized what was going on, I was back at my bind point.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, <br/>
&gt; attack anyone near<br/>
&gt; &gt;her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?  BTW I was <br/>
&gt; not in wolf<br/>
&gt; &gt;form nor was I grouped with anyone at the time who had pets <br/>
&gt; (which I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;been told will cause her to attack you).<br/>
