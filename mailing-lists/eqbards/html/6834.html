&gt; I trained disarm traps.  Ignoring for the moment that there<br/>
&gt; are no traps in the game to disarm, does anyone know how we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; supposed to disarm traps when we don&#39;t get locate traps?<br/>
&gt; Relying on a rogue to locate the traps for you is pointless<br/>
&gt; since he&#39;ll be better at disarming them.  And finding traps by<br/>
&gt; triggering them is also pointless since once they&#39;re triggered<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t need to be disarmed (unless of course they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; designed to be continuous, which would seem to make locate<br/>
&gt; traps useless).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been using instll doubt and actually had it work a couple<br/>
&gt; times.  Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>
&gt; doubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>
&gt; standard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>
&gt; point of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>
&gt; saying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill<br/>
&gt; working).  Huh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, I am REALLY impressed.  I have pressed this button hundreds of times...<br/>
maybe thousands, and NEVER had it work.  I *have* experienced the kick thing<br/>
though.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing around with beg as well.  Apparently you can<br/>
&gt; beg from monsters and mage pets, but not ships and PCs.  I<br/>
&gt; tried begging from a merchant and a guard in East Commonlands.<br/>
&gt; In both cases, they immediately killed a wandering monster<br/>
&gt; nearby.  It might&#39;ve been coincidence, but I have to wonder.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen guards kill players for begging from them before, so<br/>
&gt; I was expecting them to attack me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never begged, so i can&#39;t comment.  When you beg from a mage pet... does it<br/>
give you anything?<br/>

&gt; Sneak...  I&#39;ve heard rogues say they use sneak to make<br/>
&gt; merchants indifferent to them.  I can do the same thing with<br/>
&gt; hide, but haven&#39;t been able to do it with sneak, even when I<br/>
&gt; sneak successfully (move like a glacier).  I&#39;ll have to test<br/>
&gt; it by trying to sneak past some mobs.  I suppose it&#39;s possible<br/>
&gt; the skill is broken for non-rogues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sneaking no longer lets rogues shop where they could not shop before, as my<br/>
starving rogue discovered the other day.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that sneak works for other classes (monk and bard) but only rogues<br/>
get the success and failure messages associated with it.  Given the bard&#39;s<br/>
very low sneak scores, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re just failing your sneak all<br/>
the time, rather than the skill not working.<br/>
