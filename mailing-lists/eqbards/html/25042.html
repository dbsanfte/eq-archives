Two: Only use &#39;name brand&#39; memory.  Yeah, I know you can go out on the web<br/>
and buy that stick of pc-100 128 mb of ram for 1/3 of what CompUSA or<br/>
whoever charges, but there is a reason for that...<br/>
If you are gonna get new memory, don&#39;t be cheap and go ahead and get<br/>
Kingston or VisionTek or such. Yeah, it&#39;ll cost you a bit more in the short<br/>
term, but it&#39;ll make you alot happier in the long run.  (Compaq and HP both<br/>
use Kingston, or used to, even though it&#39;s labeled as Compaq or HP).<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
FWIW, HP doesn&#39;t appear to be using Kingston anymore.  In fact their newer<br/>
laptops will crash if you try to put a Kingston chip in the first slot and<br/>
an HP chip in the second.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d add to MacGrough&#39;s recommendation to get all the same name.  If<br/>
you&#39;ve already got, say, Compaq memory and just need another module, get<br/>
another Compaq even if another name brand is cheaper.<br/>
