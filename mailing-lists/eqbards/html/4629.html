<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021556429">I don&#39;t recall seeing a resistance message ever for a partially resistable<br/>
spell like Direct Damage (DD) ones.  However, when the caster hits me and my<br/>
health bar doesn&#39;t move from a spell that can do up to 40 points, I know I<br/>
took at most 3 or 4, I don&#39;t have that many hp&#39;s so the bar movement is<br/>
still pretty visible.  Also I resisted 4 straight roots, bummer if I&#39;m gonna<br/>
fail that would have been my choice, and 7 straight walking sleeps.  All in<br/>
all I seldom take any measurable damage from spells, but then again my MR is<br/>
jacked up pretty high for my level.  Since it is unlikely to improve much at<br/>
this point, barring increased song effects, I will undoubtedly have more<br/>
trouble at higher levels.  113 vs a hag probably isnt anywhere near as good<br/>
as having 70 somethin against lvl 15-17 casters.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and cold resist, not magic resist?  I was using Elemental and<br/>
&gt; Guardian Rhythms last night with a battle drum fighting hags<br/>
&gt; in Unrest (113 MR, 74 FR and CR, a little more or less for<br/>
&gt; others).  I didn&#39;t see a single resist message.  Do you even<br/>
&gt; get a resist message if you resist a DD?  When I did the same<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I&#39;ve experienced the Rhythm songs have been completely useless.<br/>
Just my experience though..<br/>
