&gt; i get the resist message as expected, and other times i get the message that<br/>

I figured it was a case of my resists being high enough that I instantly broke out<br/>
of the fear spell before it affected me.  Kind of like how mobs do with our songs.<br/>
Pets and a few PCs here and there were definately running off once in a while,<br/>
so his fear isn&#39;t broken.  Heh, maybe bards are now immune? :)<br/>
