&gt; even remember the last time i was feared, but what happens now is sometimes<br/>
&gt; i get the resist message as expected, and other times i get the message that<br/>
&gt; i lose control of myself and i have the fear icon, but there is no effect<br/>
&gt; (i.e. i am undoubtedly not feared).  what&#39;s up with that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I noticed that earlier this week on Naggy, before I went LD, that is. :(<br/>
I figured it was a case of my resists being high enough that I instantly broke out<br/>
of the fear spell before it affected me.  Kind of like how mobs do with our songs.<br/>
Pets and a few PCs here and there were definately running off once in a while,<br/>
so his fear isn&#39;t broken.  Heh, maybe bards are now immune? :)<br/>
