<div id="ygrps-yiv-140800741">&quot;Dance of the Dead - targetted corpse, if within range (limited to<br/>
about 100 feet or so, of course) gets up and walks to it&#39;s owner (Owner<br/>
must be within &quot;heal&quot; range of the Bard)&quot;<br/>
This would be great for lava and &quot;stuck in the wall&quot; retrievals, but not as<br/>
powerful as the Necro summoning. Additionally, Necros could get this as a<br/>
spell at a lower level, giving them a little more power, too.<br/>

(Yep - still pushing it ;)<br/>
