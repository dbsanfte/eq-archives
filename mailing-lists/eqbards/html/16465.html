&gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; to have when the real spells fail.  I waited 22 levels for this.  Sigh,<br/>
&gt; maybe I should just give in and play a necro so I can complain about how my<br/>
&gt; 400 pt DoT&#39;s take a whole minute to happen and my 65 point heal/DD&#39;s aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mana efficient because my pet keeps me from ever taking damage.  Sighs in<br/>
&gt; defeat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a great song.  I&#39;ve had it memmed constantly since I got it, and I&#39;m level 46.  I suppose it<br/>
depends on your usual groups, but I tend to keep getting groups with no Rangers or Druids, and trust me,<br/>
Chains is a LOT better than nothing.  I usually don&#39;t bother to throw until they start to run, unless<br/>
we&#39;re in real train danger (I use Largo&#39;s in battle).  Heck, last night I was with 2 Rangers in the Sol B<br/>
King Room, we pulled several multiple-MOB groups, and I had to Chain to stop the stuff at the end.  And<br/>
these are level 45+ Rangers, mind you.  Better to cover yourself.  As with all our songs, it works better<br/>
the higher-level you are, btw.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, although I missed Charming two Giants against each other (never had the patience to find two of them<br/>
at once), I&#39;m now Fear/Chaining single SGs, Specters and kobolds.  A little tedious, but better than no<br/>
exp!  I fear/chained Terrorantula last night, even.  Note:  Fear has such a small radius, that you have to<br/>
stand right *under* this spider to make it work.  ;)<br/>

Kenross Cantoforjado, 46 songs, Innoruuk  (woo hoo!  planes capable!)<br/>

PS - And yeah, my guild refers to the Necros in the guild as &quot;BS Necros&quot;.  I took it as a mark of pride to<br/>
be referred to as a &quot;BS Bard&quot; the other day.  hehe.</div>
