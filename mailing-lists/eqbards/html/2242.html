<div id="ygrps-yiv-961920706">When I first started, my #1 mission was to get into patchwork - took up<br/>
tailoring, fairly easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I got anything in leather, that couldn&#39;t be made in patchwork.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I started saving and replacing patchwork with banded, one piece at a<br/>
time - then working to leather.<br/>
<br/>
I have a studded collar, purity belt and bloodstained mantle - the rest is<br/>
just straight banded.<br/>
<br/>
Will go about working on replacing each of the banded pieces with a nice<br/>
magical one - as I find them, or see them for sale at a decent price.<br/>
