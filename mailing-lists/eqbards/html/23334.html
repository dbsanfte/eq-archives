&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually this guy is one of the best players i&#39;ve grouped <br/>
&gt; with, and i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; often put my butt on the line and he&#39;s saved it.  His druid <br/>
&gt; was his first<br/>
&gt; char which is 49 (lost a lev being binded at pot room in tim <br/>
&gt; deep).  At some<br/>
&gt; point in his playing time, he made an ogre warrior and is <br/>
&gt; level 60. His<br/>
&gt; second account has a cleric 43 i beleive on it and his new <br/>
&gt; rogue...  Trust<br/>
&gt; me he&#39;s not a newb, and is pretty damn impressive meat <br/>
&gt; shield.  Back when we<br/>
&gt; were on sol ro, he came in second place in the botb warrior <br/>
&gt; competition, he<br/>
&gt; was 57 then against a 60 ogre with a fungi bp, and he was <br/>
&gt; wearing his hate<br/>
&gt; armor.  He got that guy down much further then the 60 that <br/>
&gt; went up against<br/>
&gt; him in the quarter finals.  He&#39;s a horrible cleric but a <br/>
&gt; great tank and<br/>
&gt; druid.  I am not going to name him, but im sure most 55+ <br/>
&gt; players on sol ro<br/>
&gt; know who he is.   I know many soloers are horrible in groups <br/>
&gt; (such as a damn<br/>
&gt; druid that kept dotting my mezzed dog in dreadlands) but my <br/>
&gt; buddy is just<br/>
&gt; leveling himself up another tank so he can group with us <br/>
&gt; again.  Another of<br/>
&gt; my buddies has a 56 warrior now because he became bored of not getting<br/>
&gt; groups with his 53 necro.  Its not only twinks you&#39;re seeing <br/>
&gt; leveling up,<br/>
&gt; but high level players that are getting bored of doing this <br/>
&gt; for an hour:<br/>
&gt; /ooc XYZ level XZ class looking for group...  These 2 players <br/>
&gt; are the 2<br/>
&gt; tanks i trust the most<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Minkin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. Dont assume all players are created the same, some are <br/>
&gt; better then<br/>
&gt; others. One bad apple doesnt ruin a orchard.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really don&#39;t know if it is a lot of &quot;mediocre players&quot; are hitting <br/>
&gt; the 50+ range, or if it is all the twinks:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;a friend went to twink his newb rogue in guk last night using <br/>
&gt; his druid and he got from lev 1 to lev 17 in 5 hours in upper <br/>
&gt; guk. I know he&#39;s loving the new xp system.&quot;<br/>
&gt; -- Minkin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know of a level 50 warrior in my guild who has less than <br/>
&gt; five /played days (second computer with 50+ cleric/50+ chanter <br/>
&gt; characters), and, as far as I know, has never grouped. Do you think I <br/>
&gt; plan on putting my life on the line assuming he knows how to play his <br/>
&gt; class?<br/>
