<div id="ygrps-yiv-624153857"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But the fact is in the EQ world we are becoming woefully underpowered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree, I have yet to see some manner in which I am &quot;underpowered&quot; I do<br/>
okay solo (once I figured out how) I do over 1000pts damage in 36 seconds<br/>
(on a pull of 5 mobs) I give our group a major decrease in down time. I am<br/>
just not seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Case in point the new SOW problem, the Z-axis bug, and there are more.  The<br/>
fact is I love being a bard because of WHAT a bard is.. not because of what<br/>
Verant made the bard.  It is evident that bards are being treated as a<br/>
second class, class.  What other class has had their spell deliberatly<br/>
placed as lesser value?  Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW overpowering<br/>
Accel was not an accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh pshaw, it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;s clearly a bug. They have a poorly modeled speed<br/>
data structure and they keep tweeking it (I can almost visualize it now<br/>
after all these changes). It&#39;s broke, it will be fixed. Petition it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like to<br/>
see some more special items for bards<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>.  I&#39;d like to see some more useful songs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to figure out all th euses for the songs I have...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing us without reguard to the results.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have yet to see proof it is an intentional nerf. As I said, petition it.<br/>
