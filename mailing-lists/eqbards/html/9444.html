&gt; &gt; PoH was opened this weekend.  That was the reason for all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; undead all over the place and the GM events on all the servers<br/>
&gt; &gt; - PoH was opened and released hell spawn onto Norrath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where did you hear this? The Plane of Hate hasn&#39;t been opened<br/>
&gt; yet. The surge in undead around the land was for Halloween. You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; see things returning to normal now that it&#39;s over.<br/>
