<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456089561">they have mentioned they were going to fix this, but never have.  low, med,<br/>
high look the same to me.  they need to let you see epic weapons no matter<br/>
what your density, or have a separate setting for them, and they need to<br/>
make the settings actually mean something, since they all look the same.  i<br/>
don&#39;t see how a bard can play with particles on, which is unfortunate.  i<br/>
would love to play in a low setting if it really meant low.<br/>

&gt; out them.  I<br/>
&gt; always kept the density set to low ...but the sparkles look <br/>
&gt; the same to me<br/>
&gt; on low, med and high.  Is it just me?  I hit 39 last night <br/>
&gt; and the particle<br/>
&gt; effects are killing me.  I don&#39;t want to turn them off but I <br/>
&gt; am not seeing<br/>
&gt; a choice here.  Any suggestions?  I play in the &quot;out of body&quot; <br/>
&gt; views already.<br/>
