<div id="ygrps-yiv-528615770">Just to chime in, I only swap instruments when fighting. I suppose if we could use 2-handed weapons, then it&#39;d be a little easier to swap. It&#39;d be very hard to swap your primary and secondary weaps for your instruments during combat repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Sure I&#39;d swap during combat, maybe once, if I saw that my particular medley of songs (I mean how strange is it to hear 3 songs at the same time?) wasn&#39;t as effective with instruments vs weapons.<br/>
<br/>
At 35 it would depend greatly on the situtation. That&#39;s what makes us so much fun to play. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If we had at least a couple of melee guys, then I&#39;d throw in Anthem de Arms (rarely was with an enchanter, so this was pretty standard).<br/>
<br/>
If we didn&#39;t have a snarer, then I&#39;d sing Chains. Once a couple of people in the group started taking a lot of damage, I&#39;d start singing Hymnn of Restoration. Caster heavy groups, I&#39;d weave in one Clarity song. Also, this seems to have a nice taunt so it was useful in that regards too.<br/>
<br/>
With an enchanter, Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding is nice so you don&#39;t break their mez.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth was tossed in there at times as well if I didn&#39;t know what else to sing.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, if we were fighting a particularly nasty set of casters, then just drums (or tambourine) with the Rhythm songs were very nice (weaving with Hymnn and mandolin).<br/>

&gt; This is a good idea .. thanks :)<br/>
&gt; Honestly, its so  nice you guys are really supportive!  I was feeling really<br/>
&gt; inadequate at barding because I couldn&#39;t do this but it seems its really not<br/>
&gt; necessary!  If I play with casters, its easy to keep them happy - just play<br/>
&gt; mana ALL THE TIME! Haha!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, if anyone is bored and wants to share.. what songs were your standards<br/>
&gt; at 35ish?  I usually play iwht a monk or a monk/cleric if that helps...<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have done this albeit rare, I generally prefer to watch the <br/>
&gt; &gt; battle over<br/>
&gt; &gt; staring at the hot boxes.  It was usually only where high <br/>
&gt; &gt; resistances were<br/>
&gt; &gt; needed, like Kithicor.  I was around level 29 or 30 at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; time so I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; a battery.  It was set up like this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 1: Anthem<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 2: Elemental Rythms<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 3: Primary hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 4: Secondary hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 5: Inventory slot<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slot 6: Inventory slot<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Depending on how fast you get you can do it like this:  While <br/>
&gt; &gt; moving the<br/>
&gt; &gt; primary weapon out of the primary slot start up your <br/>
&gt; &gt; instrument song, drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; the primary weapon on the drum in the inventory then drop the <br/>
&gt; &gt; drum on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; secondary weapon.  Keep the secondary weapon in your cursor, <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the inventory.  Once it pulses start another song and swap <br/>
&gt; &gt; the secondary<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon and the instrument, drop the instrument on the primary <br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon and<br/>
&gt; &gt; equip it.  Once you get good at this you can try taking out one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; inventory slots in the hot bank and replace it with a third song.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt <br/>
&gt; &gt; whose main is a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and <br/>
&gt; &gt; there... &quot;less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three <br/>
&gt; &gt; to four songs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory <br/>
&gt; &gt; slots, and #2 bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, <br/>
&gt; &gt; switch to #1, switch<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new <br/>
&gt; &gt; song without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one <br/>
&gt; &gt; of those things<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to <br/>
&gt; &gt; switch hotkey<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;banks...<br/>
