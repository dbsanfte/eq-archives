&gt; One amusing death I had was against a giant that I tried<br/>

&gt; Broog Bloodbeard, which I found out later is around level<br/>
&gt; 46, and has some 15000hp.  :)  I was so shocked I ran into<br/>
&gt; a tree, and that&#39;s all she wrote.  He hits for around 130,<br/>
&gt; and stuns a level 30 player real good.  I went from full<br/>
&gt; health to death without even being able to move.<br/>

moment there was nothing there, next he was on top of us).  To<br/>
give you an idea how much 15000 hp is, the L45 paladin and I<br/>
hacked at him for a good 2 minutes while the cleric went OOM<br/>
keeping us healed.  Broog&#39;s hp bar barely budged.  By this<br/>
time the others finished off the cyclops (the original<br/>
pull) and jumped in on Broog.  We went on for another 3<br/>
minutes or so (mid-30s ranger and monk managed to do some<br/>
tanking as well).  We took off a total of maybe 1/4 of his hp<br/>
through all this, then all our healers were OOM, he dropped<br/>
the paladin, started pounding on me, I ran, and he killed 2<br/>
more before the others reached the zone.  I lived with 6 hp;<br/>
apparently a level 40 bard&#39;s Accelerando without a drum is<br/>
fast enough to outrun him even while walking at 6 hp.<br/>
<br/>
The named cyclops in the Ocean of Tears (Queg?) is not quite<br/>
as bad, and he took 6 of us at L40-46 a good 5 minutes to<br/>
kill.  Not surprisingly, we got 2gp as loot.<br/>
