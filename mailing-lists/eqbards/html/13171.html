<div id="ygrps-yiv-455109875"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I agree that all of our songs are temporary.  But I would point out that all<br/>
&gt; spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true.  But unlike spells, which can be cast and forgotten about for<br/>
long periods of time, Bard songs must be continuously sung to work<br/>
effectively.  A song that could be sung and have a permanent effect would be<br/>
contrarian to the way the class works.  Forgetting game balance and all other<br/>
issues, a binding song just makes no sense in the world of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Heck, if we had 6 or 7 combat skills like the other 3 hybrids, I&#39;d agree that<br/>
&gt; Bind would be completely inappropriate.  But really, it would be like saying,<br/>
&gt; Clerics can&#39;t have bind because the Rangers would be pissed!  We&#39;re a breed<br/>
&gt; apart.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed we are a breed apart.  As another poster has written we are &quot;no-class.&quot;<br/>
 I would almost say that there are four types of player classes in EQ:<br/>
casters, melee, hybrids, and bards.  True, we don&#39;t have the combat skills<br/>
that the 3 hybrids do.  But we can do some pretty amazing things to<br/>
compensate.  We don&#39;t use mana like the other hybrids (Dirge excepted).  We<br/>
can reduce downtime like no other class in the game.  We can fill wildcard<br/>
spots in just about any group: from crowd control to tanking.  To give us<br/>
these combat skills would unbalance us wildly, and the next thing you know all<br/>
the kewl d00dz would be playing bards.<br/>
<br/>
I would love a binding song.  I would love better combat skills.  But I<br/>
honestly think that beefing us up in either of these areas would cause other<br/>
classes to call foul...and probably result in a suite of unwanted nerfs for<br/>
the bard class.</div>
