<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240803046">My experience in the top roost is that if there is a aviak standing on the<br/>
outside plus one on the inside right platform, attacking the one outside<br/>
will pull the one on the inside right platform.  I assumed that it would<br/>
take the three of us a long time to kill the avocet (I was highest level<br/>
character at 28 and the other 2 were melee types).  I also assumed that the<br/>
lament would wear off before we killed the avocet.  As a result, I assumed<br/>
the best way to ensure the aviak on the inside right platform (harrier in<br/>
this case) would not attack us during the middle of the fight was to<br/>
teleport to the ground.  Didn&#39;t actually think of fighting it on the catwalk<br/>
leading down from the top roost.<br/>

&gt; roosting<br/>
&gt; birds, why not just fight the avo on the deck (not in the room) or drag<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; to the first skinny catwalk going down?  20-20 hindsight.<br/>
