<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797702138"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It doesn&#39;t seem to stack with some buffs, like the druid/<br/>
&gt;ranger&#39;s shield of bards or whatever it&#39;s called.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   The 3 different types of dmg shields are the Coat Series (Druid/Ranger<br/>
Self Only), Shield Series (Druid/Ranger Targetable), and Heat/Frost Series<br/>
(O&#39;keil&#39;s Radiation, etc)<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth & Cooling fall into the 3rd set and wont stack with others<br/>
of that type.  The three types are meant to stack though, and if it&#39;s not<br/>
working currently it is a bug.  I do know Warmth stacks fine with SoT<br/>
though, as last night I was getting 13&#39;s of the hits (9 from SoT, 4 from<br/>
PoW).</div>
