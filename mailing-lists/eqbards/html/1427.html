<div id="ygrps-yiv-781614267">That&#39;s true, but only for a monk.  They suffer penalties to AC and skills<br/>
when they weigh too much.  It does not apply to any other class, as long as<br/>
they aren&#39;t fatigued or encumbered.  At that point, stats drop, which does<br/>
affect your dodge chances.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, STR helps your damage dealing, and hit potential, as well as<br/>
load bearing.  Very heavily weighted stat for any melee class.<br/>
<br/>
STA is not worth boosting.  The hitpoint increase you can obtain by maxing<br/>
your stam out as a bard is horrible, around 1 hp per level.  That&#39;s only 50<br/>
extra at 50th level, or about a quarter hit from the mobs you fight then.<br/>
Not worth it.  The problem with getting fatigued in combat is easily worked<br/>
around.  Use lighter weapons.  Any weapon with a weight of 5.0 or less will<br/>
do the trick.  Use things like barbed whips or well balanced scimitars, you<br/>
will stam out rapidly.  Using items like Jambiyas, Demon Claws, Rapiers,<br/>
etc, you end the same fight with over half stamina.<br/>
<br/>
Agi helps avoid hits, obviously, and adds to the damage reduction side of<br/>
your AC as well as being a factor in your dodge chances, and helps Safe Fall<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Dex helps you hit more often.  For non bards, it also helps parry, block,<br/>
and riposte skills some.  For &#39;real&#39; casters, it can increase resumed<br/>
casting chances, combined with Channeling.  It has NO effect on &#39;twisting&#39;.<br/>
None.  Nada. Zilch.  ANY bash will stop your song, period, there is no way<br/>
around it.  Normal hits do not.  Missed notes are entirely due to your skill<br/>
in the instrument the song is based on, and singing.  With 135 item boosted<br/>
Dex, I miss notes as often as I do with my base 95.  But I hit a lot more<br/>
often, so it&#39;s a good stat.<br/>
<br/>
Best I can figure, after 40 odd levels of barding, is that Charisma is a<br/>
very very mild stat for anything other than shopping.  Even wearing a<br/>
grotesque mask (-9 CHA) and skunk sprayed, dropping my CHA down to 52, my<br/>
resist rate is still insignificant.  Boosting it up to 140 via a Shaman&#39;s<br/>
44th level Charisma spell likewise had little effect.  It may have more<br/>
impact in the future as Geoffry tunes the class a bit more, and gets some<br/>
more coding time to do things the way they had planned, but don&#39;t hold your<br/>
breath.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the stats to drop points into, I lean on STR the most.  Max it out,<br/>
and spend the rest on Dex and Agi, depending on race.  Intelligence, Wisdom,<br/>
and Stamina are a waste of points.<br/>

&gt;The main reason I don&#39;t advocate increasing Str is based on some Monk<br/>
&gt;research that seems to confirm that increased weight regardless of str<br/>
&gt;adversely affects the dodge skill to a great degree.  therefore wearing the<br/>
&gt;best lightest armor may help you totally avoid a blow that would otherwise<br/>
&gt;hit you for reduced damage in heavier armor.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well here are my thoughts...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Put 10 in Dex, 5 in Int, and the rest in Agi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is an almost religious topic among bards, but in my opinion, put all<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;points you can into strength.  Someday, if you are like most bards, you<br/>
