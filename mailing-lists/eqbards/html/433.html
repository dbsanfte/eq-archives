<div id="ygrps-yiv-453147294">At this level i&#39;ve spent a lot of time soloing at the goblin warrior camp<br/>
in Butcherblock. It usually isn&#39;t as crowded as the chessboard and the loot<br/>
is much better there. <br/>
Another good choice would be the orc camps in Lesser Faydark. They are<br/>
always completly empty and the level range there is 7-10 at most of the camps.<br/>
With the lull song you can even go solo there.<br/>
If you just want good loot and don&#39;t care about the EXP go to the bandit<br/>
camps in Lesser Faydark. They are always very crowded but you can earn about<br/>
10pp per hour.<br/>
