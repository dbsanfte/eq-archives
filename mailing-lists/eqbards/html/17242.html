<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344163353">Also, here is my list of level 26 soling that I did with a mini-review of<br/>
each:<br/>
<br/>
Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords, Dragnors Cauldron:<br/>
Total blast, need to use all instrument to win (at least I did with my<br/>
unprocing Staff of Writhing and 65 1HBlunt) you can also do Aqua Goblin<br/>
Bosons. Lots of room for AE, little danger of picking up greens that pose<br/>
any problem. Reasonable loot, good experience. I hunted between the Eldrich<br/>
Collective camp and the AquaGoblin camp and only twice had to bail into<br/>
Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Tentacle Terrors, Najena:<br/>
Total blast. Back to the wall, all instrument attack. You MUST chain them<br/>
before they flee, there is a real danger with AE of a greenie pile-on. I got<br/>
into one down in the prison however Screech got me out again *grin* I zoned<br/>
into Lava and a crowd of teens so I said &quot;Do NOT go in there!&quot;,  I felt like<br/>
Jim Carey.... :o) Poor loot (finally got one tentacle whip however) great<br/>
exp, ickiest sound effects in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Centaurs, South Karana:<br/>
*YAWN!* They hit very hard, but when it comes down to it you can just run<br/>
and heal. Maybe I have a low tolerance for it because I tried to solo level<br/>
in South Karana (meaning I ran around bored for hours) 2 levels ago but I<br/>
find this the most tedious soling in the game. Okay exp, average to low<br/>
loot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cyclopes, Giant Skellies,  Rathe Mountains:<br/>
Kidding :o) Those were with a group, big fun though. Went to go fight the<br/>
Gnome Nerco (official new spelling) and played Guardian/Purifying Rhythms on<br/>
my new Mistmoor drum...gotta love that resist...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, a brief note, I was selling muffins in Lower Guk (I guess it must<br/>
be different on different servers, banking services and food were in pretty<br/>
small demand) and a fellow *gave* me a serpentine bracer. Well, not 20<br/>
minutes later I was running through Southern Ro and auctioning it (needing<br/>
money for gems for Lambent) and a  Troll offers to trade me a Mistmoore<br/>
Battle Drum for it...As the going price for SBracers is 250-300pp and MM<br/>
Drums go for about 500-600pp took it. Yow, yow yow yow, I am worried I will<br/>
use up ALL my outrageous luck on items (Skull Shaped Barbute 235pp) and have<br/>
none left for hunting...I REALLY need to get ripped off in a trade soon to<br/>
re-apportion my luck so it doesn&#39;t balance out in deaths. I am not sure of<br/>
the *exact* formula but I am pretty sure that is how luck works...<br/>
<br/>
*grin*<br/>
