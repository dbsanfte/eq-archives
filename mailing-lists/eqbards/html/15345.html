<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056568323"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>
&gt;could reccomend a 1h slash weapon for a level 12 bard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PGT  The Tomahawk. It starts to Proc at level 10 and looks<br/>
like a COOL axe!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, I am in bronze armor now for the most part..and it seems a bit<br/>
&gt;heavy.  Whats the next step armor wise?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bronze armor seems to be the right armor for this level. If you can get<br/>
(MUCH) money for it -- step up to steel. Same AC, lower weight.<br/>
<br/>
If not, you might want to consider stepping down to banded for some<br/>
pieces (for example, the boots. Some pieces are NOT worth their weight<br/>
one bit)</div>
