<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022051267">Saw Slyde&#39;s question about this on The Concert Hall boards. I don&#39;t know<br/>
about binding anywhere but the Coldain city for melee/hybrids. It wasn&#39;t too<br/>
hard to get to although we had a grateful druid show us after we came to try<br/>
and rez his corpse (too old though).<br/>
Buckle up for female bard directions, zonewall following in leiu of any good<br/>
landmarks: You need to cross the small island where the boat docked, cross<br/>
the larger island with the big tower (undead dungeon) on the side with the<br/>
smaller flat ice flows that connect it to a larger piece of land. I go in<br/>
this general direction, slightly to the right of the shoreline towards<br/>
inland from the water&#39;s edge. Look for the Very big dragon bone and ice<br/>
bridge and cross it to Eastern wastes. Here you can follow the water&#39;s edge<br/>
up/right to the zone wall corner and follow that. There&#39;s a steep pass to<br/>
the Great Divide. Inside this zone, follow the right zonewall again to the<br/>
stream. The Coldain City entrance is there on the wall where the stream<br/>
starts. <br/>
EQ Atlas already has a map of the Eastern Wastes:<br/>

Lev is definitely desired in the zones we&#39;ve been to so far, which with<br/>
servers down last evening is not very many! Woo, more chances to kill<br/>
groupmates with Selo&#39;s!<br/>
