&gt; &gt; As an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my <br/>

&gt; &gt; the guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me <br/>
&gt; that there was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Using quotes does work.  Example:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am in The Revolution.  Doing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /w all the revolution<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; will return The Erudin Arcanium, as they are alphabetically higher.<br/>
&gt; However, if I do<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /w all &quot;the revolution&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will get what I am looking for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (N.B. Abbreviating works, /w all &quot;the rev&quot; works identically.)<br/>

as well? (At work, I can&#39;t test this for myself right now.)<br/>
<br/>
ie. /w all &quot;oot&quot;</div>
