<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519331642">I believe that John and Rokenn were talking about having 2 bards so that<br/>
they could do the complete DOT set.<br/>
<br/>
#1 bard twist the 3 chants with drum<br/>
#2 bard do CoD+CoC+Hymn+Niv&#39;s with lute.<br/>
<br/>
That covers all of our DOTs and healing, which no single bard can do.  It<br/>
also makes it so the bard doesn&#39;t have to switch instruments to get maximum<br/>
effect.<br/>

&gt; I used the Chants in Hate the other night as well, and had pretty much the<br/>
&gt; same results that you did.  On golems and clerics, I switched to buffing<br/>
&gt; mode, and on everything else I twisted the Chants.  I noticed that on mobs<br/>
&gt; that I was able to stick the Chants on consistently, we always got the<br/>
&gt; experience (2 tanks, cleric, druid, bard, and non-nuking enchanter) -- I<br/>
&gt; stopped taking counts after we got the first 4 of 5.  Also, that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; time I&#39;ve ever been summoned by /anything/ in my entire bardic life, and<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; felt GOOD!  (I was getting jealous of seeing everyone else&#39;s name spam by.<br/>
&gt; I got summoned 3 times total, actually.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As long as there is a warrior or ranger in the group, I tend to have<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; problem drawing attention twisting these three songs.  If not, I do draw<br/>
&gt; some heat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just one note, though: since these are DoT&#39;s, the only benefit of having<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; bards play them is to overcome resist rates (which is definitely a benefit<br/>
&gt; that shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly).  Since the songs don&#39;t stack (okay, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; assuming here, since it&#39;s a DoT effect), two bards who are each able to<br/>
&gt; consistently stick the songs won&#39;t buy you a lot.  Of course, in the<br/>
&gt; Planes,<br/>
&gt; it does seem warranted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tested just before going to the Hate and verified that the Resist debuff<br/>
&gt; components do stick with the shammie line (combined dropped me 89 points<br/>
&gt; with an MM drum).<br/>
