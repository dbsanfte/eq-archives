<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-459934261">Well the reason as I understand it is that the groups have a HUGE level<br/>
range, i.e.. last night my group was 34 cleric,24,26,29 Pallys,26 bard(me),<br/>
and 24 enchanter. when you pull you pull as far down as you want stuff and<br/>
then depending on where your group sets up you pull to your group, only one<br/>
puller at a time in the Hole, this is managed with /ooc&#39;ing &quot;In the Hole&quot;<br/>
when puller is clear /ooc&#39;ing &quot;NEXT&quot; there are hardly more then 2 or 3 in<br/>
gobbies in the pit at any time with this method and you fight non-stop.<br/>

  Just out of curiosity, why dont ppl set up in the<br/>
  warrior and raider rooms... How do you know whose<br/>
  spawns are whose, and how do you pull thru each other?<br/>
