<div id="ygrps-yiv-567617652">If you miss a note on Dirge, you lose approximately 200 mana. Depending<br/>
on your intelligence and level, missing a single note may make you<br/>
unable to fire the dirge, and I believe 2 consecutive missed notes will<br/>
doom any bard.<br/>

P.s. Rest of the post was great, just wanted to poke a bit of fun when<br/>
you said we have no mana to lose on fizzles. ;P</div>
