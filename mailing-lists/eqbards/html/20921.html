<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093503002">What is the the placeholder?  My 6 hour camp was<br/>
pretty much filled with nonstop combat and the assasin<br/>
was the first named mob we saw.  Several members of<br/>
the group who camp the dead side said that was pretty<br/>
unusual.<br/>
<br/>
For those looking for a mask, I recommend the dead<br/>
side  highly.  dying 4 times, one run, one revive and<br/>
two rezes, I still ended up with a quarter buble of xp<br/>
for the night, a fair amount of plat and all the FS I<br/>
could carry.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Mine was a 6 hour camp. Maximumeq lists the spawn<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the assasin at 29 minutes (in the comments<br/>
&gt; &gt; section).  But that is incorrect (and my wife is<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; pissed off at me this morning for all the time I<br/>
&gt; spent<br/>
&gt; &gt; camping that thing...)  Point here is, have a pot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; coffee on, you may be luckier than me, but the<br/>
&gt; assasin<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a rare spawn.<br/>
