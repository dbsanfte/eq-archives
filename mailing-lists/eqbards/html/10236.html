<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627466347">One song I have always thought would be fun is a song with effects similiar <br/>
to the AD&D spell confusion.  What this spell did was cause a monster to <br/>
either: frenzy on the nearest player/NPC, frenzy on the nearest NPC, stand <br/>
around looking confused, wander off and forget about the party, no effect at <br/>
all.  Not the greatest combat song but it would be great for dispersing <br/>
trains :)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d like to see a bind song!  hahaha, just kidding.<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;d really like to see is a memory blur song.<br/>

&gt;Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>
&gt;discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>
&gt;before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>
&gt;classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>
&gt;discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>
&gt;we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>
&gt;useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are <br/>
&gt;raises<br/>
&gt;to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>
&gt;disappointed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>
&gt;list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>
&gt;list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>
&gt;expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>
&gt;seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>
&gt;could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>
&gt;the lead on this:-)<br/>
