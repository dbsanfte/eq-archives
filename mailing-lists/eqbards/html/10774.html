Well i sepnt about 2500pp on new equipment, i revamped all my jewelry and now i have 160cha. Then the big day arrived, i got charm. I mem&#39;d it and ran out to nroth karana to try it out. I charmed a lion, and got it to attack a snake, then i redid thia until the snake started running, i asked the lion to go attack it. It ran off and 20 seconds later i it was dead. Then i went to south kara and charmed an elephant, i got it to attack a minotaur and when the charm ran otiu they ran towards me, and beat the livin #%@$ outta me =( i got rooted or something and i couldnt cast. So my question is HOW DO I USE CHARM? i really dont want all ym cha stuff to go to waist, i sold SO much to afford all of it.
