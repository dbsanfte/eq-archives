<div id="ygrps-yiv-23412846">Yep..  John(tm)&#39;s results are even posted over at www.castersrealm.com.<br/>
Hopefully we really are going to get this song looked at again.  Thanks<br/>
again for your effort here John.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - We were fighting multi-mobs in the Frenzy last night on Druzzil as<br/>
previously mentioned.  Just for grins I loaded up Lullaby and tried to<br/>
contain extras that we were fighting (no lute, CHA 162) during a couple of<br/>
the fights.  The results were predictable.<br/>

Resist, ouch ouch, Resist, ouch ouch, Resist, OUCH OUCH, Resist, OUCH OUCH,<br/>
Resist, OUCH! OUCH!  SCREW THIS!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I spoke to Geoff about the original author&#39;s tests. It looks like<br/>
&gt; there might be<br/>
&gt; *something* strange going on, but we&#39;ll have to run some more<br/>
&gt; tests in House.<br/>
&gt; Geoff will take another look at it after he gets done with the<br/>
&gt; first draft of<br/>
&gt; the expansion spells in the next few days.<br/>
