<div id="ygrps-yiv-779770949"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At level 32, one wrong move and you are dead in the Butler&#39;s Room.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m certain a level 32 druid with thistles up could probably knock<br/>
&gt;out the butler fairly quickly.  But the Butler, like many other<br/>
&gt;inhabitants, drops a harm touch (~200 dmg).  And if said druid<br/>
&gt;agro&#39;s the gargoyle that usually stands in there, or agros a <br/>
&gt;hallway roamer - KYAG.  It&#39;s all in the pull vector, and object<br/>
&gt;angles that makes the room look really easy, until the unexpected<br/>
&gt;may occur.  I know, I&#39;ve been there many many times.  Your level 32<br/>
&gt;druid will most likely finish the battle at 4o% mana and 5o% health.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t call that easy, I call it doable.  =)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>harmonic - A couple of things said druid wanted me to point out about butler<br/>
room...you already hit one on the head, as usual you are quite astute : )<br/>
<br/>
1.  Harmony works in mistmoore<br/>
2.  Druid has not killed anything that gives him Bad MM faction.  What this<br/>
means is that he is Indifferent to MM faction things in Wolf Form.  Combine<br/>
that with liberal doses of Harmony, and there is very little chance of anything<br/>
jumping in (like basically 0%)to aid the butler or the Maid, or the Catliff. <br/>
He has killed (since lvl 32, he is now 43) the Butler 2x, the Maid at least 2x,<br/>
the catliff enough to get 2 Crested helms, and a truckload of shoulders, the<br/>
Cloaked D once. (He hasn&#39;t killed Mynthi yet for the drum, but he did e-mail me<br/>
a screenshot of him standing next to her while she was holding the drum....just<br/>
to irritate me..)<br/>
<br/>
But, the difference between &quot;doable&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; is a matter of opinion.  He<br/>
INSISTED that i use the word &quot;easy&quot; when describing the Butler....including the<br/>
example that it was easier than the Ancient Croc in Upper Guk...he also said<br/>
that he does not remeber being harm touched...is it possible that the Butler<br/>
(if he spawns) during the DAY does not harm touch, but the one at night does? <br/>
He said he just may not remember the HT, but i would think he would remember<br/>
that!<br/>

adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
