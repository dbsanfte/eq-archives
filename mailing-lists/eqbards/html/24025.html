Don&#39;t HT and LoH have a 90 minute recycle time?  Hmm, maybe we can <br/>
just think of DDD as a bard&#39;s &quot;HT&quot;.  Yes, it&#39;s crappy in comparison, <br/>
but aren&#39;t all of our other abilities that we &quot;steal&quot;?  /sarcasm  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that my biggest complaint with the song is that it clashes <br/>
with 39 charm.  This song was put in way before they decided to add <br/>
the mana component of the higher charm.  I have rarely gone <br/>
completely OOM from using just charm unless I recently got ressed.  <br/>
But combine charm with DDD and you can kiss that mana goodbye.  I <br/>
just think that they maybe should&#39;ve thought about this better when <br/>
they added the mana component to charm.  I think that I might <br/>
actually use the song if it weren&#39;t for this clash.<br/>
