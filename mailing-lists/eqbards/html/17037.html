<div id="ygrps-yiv-749876469">woohoo!  If this hold out I for one will be very happy!  I think the main<br/>
problem with the bard class is the low skill caps.  I think a good deal of<br/>
our difficulties would be helped by raising our caps especially on dodge<br/>
which I am about to hit.  Making our Hide/Sneak work like rogues would be a<br/>
good idea as well.  Only bards and rogues get both as class skills.<br/>
<br/>
Hide : Invis even on undead, cannot move capped at 75 I think<br/>
Sneak :  Will let you crawl behind mobs.  Also capped at 75 I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues can do both at once to be invis all the time to everyone.  SoW&#39;d<br/>
sneak is about like normal walk.  Sneak cannot be used with hide or with<br/>
bard invis by bards.<br/>

Hey all!  Good news for those us who like the Forage skill!  I was happily<br/>
running along today hitting my forage button as I always do, when I go the<br/>
message: You have become better at Forage (41).  Yippeee.  They have raised<br/>
the skill cap on forage.  I had to log out before I found out what the max<br/>
was, but I thought I&#39;d pass that along to you all.<br/>
