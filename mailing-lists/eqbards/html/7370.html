<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863125156">Another neat effect that could be applied to languages is if songs sung in a<br/>
mobs native language had a better chance of success, i.e. lowers their<br/>
chance to resist.  I think someone brought this up a long time ago on this<br/>
list but I don&#39;t remember who it was.  I doubt this will ever happen because<br/>
its too easy to raise language skills with spamming.  Anyone have an idea on<br/>
how Verant could implement something like this without making it a class<br/>
balance issue?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; which got me to wondering.  What DO they give us that<br/>
&gt;&gt; many languages for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe they&#39;re needed for research. Not that that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;very useful for Bards.. but for casters, they need the<br/>
&gt;languages. But that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve heard, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;verify it myself.<br/>

all the time, and each time a gnoll yelled at you, you actually had a chance<br/>
to learn a little gnollish. :) So in the begging you&#39;d see:<br/>
<br/>
A gnoll says, &#39;Wok wollo ulmplatim oke an llyels om lma obbla for!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And it would soon become:<br/>
<br/>
A gnoll says, &#39;Your infamous reputation is an affront to all I stand for!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Would be neat watching it improve as you learn.<br/>
