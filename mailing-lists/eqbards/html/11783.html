<div id="ygrps-yiv-724492133">Spell is Summon Corpse, Necro only, level 29. Reagent costs some 200 plat<br/>
and is unknown where to get it as of yet. The spell itself comes from a<br/>
necro mob in Paws. Since the Rosch seem to be the casters this means it<br/>
either comes from the Named Rosch in the back or the dreaded Ishva Mal whose<br/>
guards are red to me at 35.<br/>

There is a Summon Corpse spell.  Your corpse can be pulled from anywhere in<br/>
the current zone to the feet of the caster (necro I believe.)  Also rumored<br/>
to require a reagent (black enameled coffin???) not yet located on mobs or<br/>
vendors.<br/>
<br/>
Any info?<br/>

p.s. saw a post and person asked what mob in Paw dropped this spell. Not<br/>
sure if he meant spell or the reagent.<br/>
