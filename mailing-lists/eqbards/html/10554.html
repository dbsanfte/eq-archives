<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012316723">Not sure of this fellas history of complaining, but I<br/>
think he has a legitimate beef in this instance.  Hey,<br/>
if it keeps one idiot from doing this stuff, it&#39;s fine<br/>
by me.  If you are sick of him complaining--Don&#39;t read<br/>
his posts.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  Yesterday, I had<br/>
some idiot running sand giants fairly close to me too.<br/>
 It&#39;s really quite a distraction when you are trying<br/>
to fight something and you see a sand giant running<br/>
straight at you.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem<br/>
&gt; with a member of our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; class engaging in behavior that is so intrusive of<br/>
&gt; others? It&#39;s bad when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do something dumb and endanger myself, or my group<br/>
&gt; - endangering bystanders<br/>
&gt; &gt; is just unforgiveable in my book, especially when<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s unnecessary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You do nothing but complain on this list.  And you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;   sign your name.  I&#39;m a little concerned that you<br/>
&gt; have some built<br/>
&gt;   up anger inside.  (I&#39;ve mentioned it before<br/>
&gt; through the use of<br/>
&gt;   your &quot;quotation marks&quot; and CAPITALIZATION.)  Is<br/>
&gt; there something<br/>
&gt;   we can do to calm you down?<br/>
