<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320767627">Actually the Ervaj songs (50 and 60) do stack with all forms of haste,<br/>
spell/song or item, so they can do it if they wanted to.  They were<br/>
advertised as also going over the haste cap, but tests have shown they<br/>
do not.  They are 5% and 10% respectively (useless that small and<br/>
without going over the haste cap), probably designed that way with the<br/>
intent of being 10% and 20% with instruments, which they require rather<br/>
than just being able to sing with the lesser stats.  However as we all<br/>
know, unfortunately instruments do not increase haste (or mana) on any<br/>
of our songs, just stats like strength, agility, etc.<br/>

Not sure if they could do the stackable haste spells the way they<br/>
currently<br/>
work.  They might be working on it dont know.  But currently 1 haste<br/>
spell/icon and one item is all that will stack (sure you knew that, just<br/>
rambling).<br/>
