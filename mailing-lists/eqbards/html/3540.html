&gt; The purity belts are AC3, +2 STR, +2 STA. They usually sell for anywhere from<br/>
&gt; 5pp to 10pp. They are found on the island of the Sisters of Erollisi. On this<br/>
&gt; island are warriors just named &quot;a sister of erollisi&quot; that carry a rusty halberd<br/>
&gt; and a purity belt.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The information above is correct.  My gnome necromancer has sold MANY MANY of these<br/>
belts.  I also have about 60 still in the bank. If you&#39;re on Karana, I&#39;ll sell you<br/>
one cheap.<br/>
<br/>
I sell mine for 2 or 3 plat btw... when you have 100 to move, holding out for 5 to<br/>
10 plat isn&#39;t feasible. :)<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note, killing sisters is bad for your wood elf faction.  It&#39;s something<br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
Faydark&#39;s champions worse<br/>
Clerics of tunare worse<br/>
Kingtearisthex worse<br/>
Emerald warriors worse<br/>
Crushbone orcs better<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s right, your faction with CB orcs goes UP.<br/>
