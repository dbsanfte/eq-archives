<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107607899"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One thing I have noticed: for some reason, seems like more wood elves and <br/>
&gt; high elves have attitude problems than the other races.  Wood elf male bards <br/>
&gt; being the worst.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now you&#39;re making me paranoid...  We&#39;re not all bad, I think...<br/>
<br/>
Really, I&#39;m the nicest male Wood Elf Bard you&#39;re likely to meet.  I&#39;d be 5<br/>
levels higher if I didn&#39;t waste all my time doing corpse recoveries...<br/>
<br/>
Next you&#39;re gonna say the blonde surfer-dude ones are worst of all... Sigh.<br/>
I knew I should have been one of the Keanau Reeves-looking Half-Elves...<br/>
<br/>
- Luvas of Fennin Ro.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Speaking of being 5 levels higher, My glacial climb in experience has<br/>
    broght me in sight of 20th.  Any suggestions for a last name for a tow-<br/>
    headed wood elf songslinger?<br/>
<br/>
PPS: I&#39;d be happy to be a Gnome Lemming.</div>
