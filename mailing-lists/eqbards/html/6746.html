<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206760580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What I foresee is this: to still the slowly rising tide of complaints from<br/>
&gt;bards who feel that they have fewer class-specific items than any other<br/>
&gt;class,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s odd. Until very very recently this list was populated with<br/>
discussion of how to get the most from the class not complaining about what<br/>
how it was nerfed, broken, ignored, unattended to.<br/>
As the latest patches did not change us radically (SoW/Selos/Root/chain have<br/>
been messed up in different ways forever), it must be some other factor at<br/>
work.<br/>
