<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742752795">Not only do I turn off OOC, I turn off SHOUT and AUCTION.  If I am looking <br/>
for something I will suffer and turn Auction back on.  I have found that <br/>
shout is totally annoying.  If someone needs help and plainly says &quot;help&quot; <br/>
without shouting, chances are they are actually close enough that I can help <br/>
them (and I will) but who wants to hear some numbnutz aimlessly bellowing <br/>
into the darkness about their putrid corpse?  I think what it really comes <br/>
down to is, although I am generally a social creature, I have definite limits <br/>
with whom I am willing to socialize and, frankly, the vast majority of people <br/>
playing this game are not worthy of my company.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I have <br/>
met some really fun, intelligent, great people and characters.  Shame they <br/>
are just as few and far between in EQ as they are in real life.<br/>
