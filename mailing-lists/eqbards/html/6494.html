<b>Subject:</b> Why doesn&#39;t it work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273309734">Okay, my brass and strings skills are maxed out, so that should not be a<br/>
problem.<br/>
I was trying the &quot;all songs&quot; concept, and it DOESN&#39;T WORK.<br/>
<br/>
Just for safety, I was in Splitpaw, where there are only 3 things that will<br/>
attack me: Ghanex Drah, his pet and the occasional wandering zombie.<br/>
<br/>
Welp....<br/>
1st round:  with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, half killed his pet, then<br/>
died.<br/>
2nd round. with weapons, I barely killed Ghanex, did hardly anything to his<br/>
pet, then died.<br/>
3rd round. songs only, I didn&#39;t do half health to Ghanex.  WHY?!!?!<br/>
I was weaving DDD with brass, and Chords and Hymn on strings, but still, he<br/>
barely took any damage.<br/>
Why did I lose a level on this?<br/>
<br/>
Talies the 19th level again. (and rapidly going downward as he tries again<br/>
and again to retrieve his corpse)</div>
