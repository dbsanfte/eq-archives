<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443491099">I&#39;d tell this guy he needs to retake his ECON 101 class so he fully<br/>
understood the laws of supply/demand.  If Verant were to change the Ykesha<br/>
to where only warriors could equip it (and they publicly said they weren&#39;t),<br/>
then the demand would drop drastically.  Only a stupid warrior would pay 10K<br/>
for them at that point.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant<br/>
&gt; &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
