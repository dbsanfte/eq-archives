<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810084271">I got to play around with Sirens (level 27) a bit before I<br/>
lost the level helping a friend recover his corpse.  Only the<br/>
second time that&#39;s happened, and I&#39;m not particularly careful<br/>
about this type of thing, so I&#39;m surprised when I hear people<br/>
who say they&#39;ve lost a level many times.  Anyway, my<br/>
comments on charming:<br/>
<br/>
Duration is like our other songs - 3 pulses, except being a<br/>
charm song, it is also random.  So it may last 0.1 seconds, or<br/>
it may last the full 3 pulses.  Haven&#39;t been able to figure<br/>
out if charisma makes any difference in this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a wind song, but doesn&#39;t require a wind instrument.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t able to notice much difference between using a flute or<br/>
not.  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Bad song to use in dungeons or in camps.  Stuff that is green<br/>
and normally will not attack you *will* attack your pet if<br/>
it&#39;s low enough level.  Very easy to start a low level train<br/>
this way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s difficult to join the fight since you have to target your<br/>
pet to re-charm it.  If you recharm it, it seems to continue<br/>
its last attack order.  When it uncharms, both it *and* the<br/>
thing it was fighting usually come after you.  Don&#39;t order<br/>
your pet to attack guards or sand giants.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Monsters do a *lot* more damage than this little bard can do.<br/>
It&#39;s kinda nice being able to do double 20-50 point damage,<br/>
albeit indirectly.  In the proper situation, this song can<br/>
easily be more effective than wading into combat yourself.<br/>
This is a very viable strategy for when you&#39;re not<br/>
participating in combat yourself - you can weave Sirens with<br/>
Hymn or Rhythms with an instrument equipped.  The only problem<br/>
I had was that my group had gotten pretty used to me chaining<br/>
runners.<br/>
<br/>
You can use it to take a break from a fight.  If you&#39;re<br/>
soloing a blue and it&#39;s a close fight, charm it, equip a lute,<br/>
and weave Hymn and Sirens.  You will heal and the mob will<br/>
mostly stay charmed.  When you&#39;re comfortably healed, continue<br/>
the fight.  Be careful of the green-stuff-attacking-pet note<br/>
above - stuff that you&#39;re not used to having attack you may<br/>
attack your pet.<br/>
<br/>
It works beautifully for stopping kill stealing casters. Since<br/>
the duration is random, you just keep hitting charm over and<br/>
over while a melee friend keeps attacking.  His melee attack<br/>
will go through during the brief windows when the monster<br/>
becomes uncharmed.  Casters will not be able to anticipate<br/>
these windows, and if they&#39;re not quick enough they&#39;ll end up<br/>
casting at a recharmed mob.  Was very nice to turn the tables<br/>
last night - we got the goblin king despite two casters trying<br/>
to take him from us after he and his guards had become fixated<br/>
on our party.<br/>
<br/>
It does not work for pulling stuff from camps.  The moment<br/>
it&#39;s charmed, it becomes your pet, and anything aggressive to<br/>
you will attack it.  In fact, stuff that normally will not<br/>
attack you will attack your pet because your pet is lower<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
If your pet dies due to other monsters attacking it, its<br/>
corpse disappears because the majority of the damage was not<br/>
dealt by a player.  Be careful if you&#39;re using this to charm a<br/>
mob that carries a nice item.<br/>
