<div id="ygrps-yiv-760938388"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I hate to say this but Invis to undead is pointless.  Sonorious<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to level.  I<br/>
have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with it<br/>
active.  As soon as I dropped it I was attacked.  I have walked through<br/>
befallen with the same results.  I have no doubt that our clouding is a<br/>
universal invisability and was intended as one, there for we do not need<br/>
invis vs undead.  I think the problem is that many of you who have had<br/>
troubles with this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered out<br/>
of range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become visiable, or<br/>
are trying to hide from undead levels much higher then you where it I guess<br/>
resisted the song.  I personally would like to see a true mem blur song..<br/>
except GZ and crew are more worried about enchanters and balancing us to be<br/>
lesser the ever present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief,<br/>
then the actual usefulness of bards.<br/>

invisibility.  If they can see invis, they see invis.  If they can&#39;t, and<br/>
you&#39;re wearing it, you&#39;re invis.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested thru the toes of<br/>
Ice Giants in Permafrost to recover a friends corpse at level 27.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
been seen (unknowingly) and drew a train of undead to the Blood Pool in<br/>
Unrest around the same level (can&#39;t think of any mob in the path that was<br/>
major red to me).  I was the ONLY one in my group, and I assure you that I<br/>
did nothing to break invis.  There may be some invis to undead aspect to our<br/>
songs, but it&#39;s not because the mob gets a saving throw.<br/>
