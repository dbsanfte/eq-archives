&gt;If you remember the patch a few weeks ago the patch message said it would<br/>
&gt;decrease the number of missed notes on high level songs. Obviously Verants<br/>
&gt;soulution was to set all the songs regardless of level to the same &quot;saving<br/>
&gt;throw&quot; for missed notes. This problem began immediately after the patch, and<br/>
&gt;I agree its silly to miss a note on Selo or Hymn. I never complained about<br/>
&gt;the missed notes on a new song, it made sense it would be difficult to<br/>
&gt;learn, just like fizzles on a new spell.<br/>

at higher levels.  I&#39;m just REALLY getting sick of missing Selo&#39;s 5 times<br/>
in a row, so that Captain Shralock can kill me. :(<br/>
