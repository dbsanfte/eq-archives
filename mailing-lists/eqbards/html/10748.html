&gt; &gt; Speaking of Instill Doubt, it appears it does not cap at 75 like I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard, got mine to 78 last night!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   What&#39;s the secret to get it up faster?  I swear, I have practiced<br/>
&gt;   it for hours on end while just waiting for a rare spawn, or camping<br/>
&gt;   some obscure item - and I have gotten it to 35, but it will not go<br/>
&gt;   any higher.  In that same time I got my begging to 20, and my bind<br/>
&gt;   wound to 15.  Something must be up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both ID and Begging are skills that only get a chance to increase if you are <br/>
successful.  Once you get ID (and I assume Beg) over 50 it goes up fairly <br/>
fast and is actually useful when solo&#39;ing.  When solo&#39;ing with ID I will <br/>
start using hitting it when the target is under 50% and I have successfully <br/>
chained it, as it will turn and not move :) Giving you several free shots.  <br/>
You can practice ID on anything (corpses, players, pets, etc..)  Beg can be <br/>
practiced on pets.<br/>
<br/>
The best way I found to raise Bind Wounds (mine is maxed at 100) was to get <br/>
a backpack full of bandages and go to a crowded low-level dungeon <br/>
(Blackburrow is great for this) and shout out free wound binding at zone.  <br/>
All the melee solo&#39;ist will come and help you raise your skill.<br/>
