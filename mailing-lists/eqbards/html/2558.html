<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993086555">Well hot damn, that means when I get lung cancer from smoking all these<br/>
years that I can sue the people who made them! It&#39;s not MY fault that I<br/>
bought them in the store, not my fault I lit a bunch of crushed up plants<br/>
held together with chemically treated paper, which the paper is held round<br/>
with glue, then stuck the fiberglass type material in my mouth and sucked<br/>
on it while the opposite end was glowing red. Woohoo, using SaTaN, ahem,<br/>
excuse me, s8n&#39;s, logic, I&#39;m bound to be a millionaire.<br/>
<br/>
 OR<br/>
<br/>
 when you grow up you&#39;ll be able to tell the difference between right and<br/>
wrong, between knowing what&#39;s the correct course of actions without someone<br/>
telling you what they are. Or maybe some other kid wanting to blame<br/>
everyone else for thier bullshit will shoot you (so they can be as cool as<br/>
the &quot;gangsta&#39;s&quot;) and your parents can sue the company that made the gun.<br/>
(since it won&#39;t be the kid who pulled the trigger&#39;s fault, no need to even<br/>
put him in jail)<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are certain creatures <br/>

&gt;because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question are mostly <br/>
&gt;blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found this spot <br/>
&gt;when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms, <br/>
&gt;RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them and get on <br/>
&gt;to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the <br/>
&gt;dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me <br/>
&gt;&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a <br/>
&gt;computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t* <br/>
&gt;exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that I--or anyone <br/>
&gt;else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is using your head <br/>
&gt;to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.  <br/>
&gt;Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a bunch of wacko <br/>
&gt;powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word <br/>
&gt;&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.  Play how they <br/>
&gt;want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and epitomy of <br/>
&gt;powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only<br/>

&gt;own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you see someone <br/>
