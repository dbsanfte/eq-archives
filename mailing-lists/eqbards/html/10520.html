<div id="ygrps-yiv-12525341">Hmmm, the other potion from the alchemist shop (and one you can afford<br/>
according to your latest financial statements ;) would be the gate potion<br/>
1100pp or so.  Not sure if you would have time to cast - 6.2 seems like you<br/>
prolly could have.  Is 2 or 3 nights loot worth avoiding a death and<br/>
difficult CR?  But I guess CR was not that difficult there.  I think I would<br/>
definitely have it when I get to go to the Planes (sheesh whenever that will<br/>
be.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, so what did Sog do until / when the charm wore off? Did he<br/>
gate/succor/evac out?<br/>
<br/>
I have been in groups where a member gets charmed (picture this a Troll<br/>
Warrior with Painbringer or was it Executioner&#39;s Axe - some uber-wep, buffed<br/>
to the max with symbols, valor, enchanter celerity, etc. etc. and charmed)<br/>
and they yell for &#39;cancel magic&#39; to be cast instead of fighting him.  I<br/>
guess our enchanter mezzed him and we waited for the charm to wear off.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. after that event, we discussed disbanding him, dueling him, then<br/>
charming him and making him fight for us.  Like Harm mentions when you are<br/>
charmed you get to fight with the efficiency and powers that NPC&#39;s have.  We<br/>
dropped the idea for various reasons all adding up to too risky for him and<br/>
us and too much of a hassle for CR if he died.  Maybe worth a try someday<br/>
for fun.<br/>
