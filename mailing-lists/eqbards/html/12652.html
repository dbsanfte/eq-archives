<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318367538">Hehe - thanks!  I now have the honor of being in and having been in 2 of the<br/>
very best guilds on Innoruuk.  SotM and TP are incredibly similar in the way<br/>
they have developed a real &#39;family&#39; feeling.  There are some really fine<br/>
people in both guilds and I am really lucky to know them all.  For those of<br/>
you who have not guilded, I strongly recommend that you try it.  And there<br/>
is no greater feeling in the world (game) than to go into a Dragon Lair with<br/>
full confidence in your team. Win or lose - live or die - the feeling of<br/>
being on a great family team is the best.  <br/>
<br/>
If you need an extra bard... hehe let me know!  I&#39;d be glad to tag along for<br/>
fun!  Silvera is my heroeinne from a long time ago so I got a lot of respect<br/>
for you guys!!  <br/>

Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist the pun on your last name Harmonic :P.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sylly!  You&#39;re in Pantheon now, I didn&#39;t even notice :P.  Congrats,<br/>
Gallenite and Archi are great people :).<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. Yeah Sylly, we got both Naggy and Vox yesterday, but both are back.<br/>
Tonight&#39;s plan is Naggy again, and we have an agreement with someone else<br/>
(I have no clue whom, was worked out by my guild leader) to let them get a<br/>
couple of days to try Vox with.  If they fail, we&#39;ll kill Vox this<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.P.S. The only reason we put pressure on ML and Storm to yield to us<br/>
was because one of our members was bound on the pedestal where Vox sits<br/>
from a previous Vox killing and gated back without remembering to rebind.<br/>
Hence, getting him back was a high priority of ours.<br/>
