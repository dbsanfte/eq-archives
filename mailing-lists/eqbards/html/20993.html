Hahaha!  My favorite memory is before they lowered Meldrath&#39;s level... <br/>
At level 14, I convinced my friend Destructor that the minos would be good<br/>
xp and we ran straight to the back of the cave and Meldrath casted through<br/>
the wall and killed us in like 1 cast.  We tried unsuccessfully to get our<br/>
corpses back, suffering numerous deaths and Destructor  was ready to KILL<br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we see this dark elf, in full rubicite (now this is back in say June of<br/>
last year).  I did a /who and it was a shaman!  I remember being SOOOO<br/>
confused how a dark elf could be a shaman and so in awe of his rubicite.<br/>
Well he buffed us up good with Tuna and such. I remember Destructor taking<br/>
screenshots because his HPs went over 1000!!!    Needless to say we got our<br/>
corpses but I still harbor a secret hatred for Meldrath and kill him every<br/>
chance I get.<br/>

&gt; If you see the minotaur hero, don&#39;t expect the guards to stop <br/>
&gt; him, he eats<br/>
&gt; them for breakfast.  However I think he is camped alot these <br/>
&gt; days, so not a<br/>
&gt; threat.  Back in my heydey of Steamfont he would run rampant <br/>
&gt; through the<br/>
&gt; zone, slaughtering newbies till about 5 guards would gang up <br/>
&gt; and take him<br/>
&gt; down...<br/>
