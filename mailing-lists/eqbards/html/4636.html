<b>Subject:</b> Level 30 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-263696819">Im new to the list , so I dont know if this has been discussed. I&#39;ve recently got to level 30 and in reading the Song List v2.0 on<br/>
the Level 30 song it said it was a DoT which lower magic Resistance as well. But it seems to be a Direct Target song  (it has a red<br/>
icon like Bellow and Chain) and didnt do any noticeable damage. Is this a MR lowering song only? Anyone tested this song yet?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
