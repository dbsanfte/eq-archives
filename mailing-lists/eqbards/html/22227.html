<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040190600">Well, both Absor and Abashi seem to be pretty confused by the posts on this issue, which suggests that<br/>
there was no effort to modify Bard songs, and that this is an artifact of some other change (direct x,<br/>
perhaps).  On the other hand, they aren&#39;t able to replicate this internally (I suspect that it has to do<br/>
with messages getting crossed, which isn&#39;t going to happen very often if you test on an internal network<br/>
vs. play the game via the internet on a dialup modem from across the country).  From the tone of their<br/>
responses, I&#39;d say this was a certainty, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the Verant reponses were just as<br/>
baffled during the lullaby and snare episodes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying very hard to cure myself of my cynicism.  Verant makes it really difficult sometimes.<br/>
