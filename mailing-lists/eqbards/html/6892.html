<b>Subject:</b> RE: Petiton to replace level 14 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511742853">Well, I for one like the level 14 song.  As more and more lore items are<br/>
appearing, this song is becoming more and more useful.  Ever find a lore<br/>
item and have no idea what quest its for?  This song will often give you a<br/>
hint.<br/>
<br/>
Let me also respond to your suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
&gt;&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>toned<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want the combined power of these songs, why don&#39;t you just twist them<br/>
together?  Or are you saying that you&#39;ll like the equivelent of being able<br/>
to play an extra song at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>
&gt;&gt;amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>
&gt;&gt;instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An agility song already exists.  It combines around 15 or 20 agility with an<br/>
approximate 20-25% attack speed increase.  Level 36 if I recall.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>
&gt;&gt;song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>
&gt;&gt;Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>
&gt;&gt;level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you<br/>
&gt;&gt;can try it again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This will never happen.  This is like a warrior asking to have the gate<br/>
spell.  We already run faster than anyone else.  To expect this would just<br/>
be silly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>
&gt;&gt;bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>
&gt;&gt;mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>
&gt;&gt;someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The level 26 charm spell is IMHO the most effective technique in the game<br/>
for pulling a mob off a caster.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>
&gt;&gt;one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>
&gt;&gt;thats what everyone wants.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never happen.  Like gate, this is solely the realm of pure casters, and I&#39;m<br/>
just as happy that it stays there, or should we also give all the casters<br/>
Selo&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>
covered:<br/>
<br/>
1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>
2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>
aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>
3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>
the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>
4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>
5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>
(i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>
6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And why<br/>
does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>
7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if this sounds a little harsh, but I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing<br/>
petition after petition saying &quot;my monk should get bind&quot; or &quot;my wizard<br/>
should be able to wear plate armor&quot;.  In my opinion, Bards are the most<br/>
versitile class in the game, and the most fun to play.  We have more<br/>
abilities than anyone else, and we get to use one of the widest ranges of<br/>
equipment in the game.  Please stop trying to make this class into something<br/>
it was never meant to be, and play your bard as it was meant to be played.  <br/>
