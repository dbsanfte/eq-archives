&gt; Warrior Greaves cast Invisibility.  That&#39;s cool, but we have a<br/>
&gt; song for that<br/>
&gt; guys.  Think about it, we *don&#39;t* have songs that can summon food<br/>
&gt; and drink.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s kinda nifty, but I will admit that I hope the BP casts Gate.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do have a *skill* for summoning food and drink however.<br/>
<br/>
Giving us this is like like giving a warrior a piece with Effect: Taunt and<br/>
another with Effect: Bash.  It really doesn&#39;t make much sense.<br/>
<br/>
Also in answer to the whole AC thing.  I&#39;m not so concerned about our AC<br/>
compared to other things we can wear.  I&#39;m concerned about our AC compared<br/>
to classes that are restricted from wearing plate.  There is no way under<br/>
that model that Rogue and Ranger armor should have the same AC as Bard<br/>
armor.  I agree it doesn&#39;t have to be as high as Warriors, but it should be<br/>
higher than chain.  I suspect that the Clerics are in the same boat here<br/>
though I haven&#39;t paid any attention to their armor stats...<br/>
