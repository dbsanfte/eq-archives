<div id="ygrps-yiv-755663100">Can some one tell approx what a Shiny Brass Halbrid is worth in pp?<br/>
<br/>
I got one and obviously can&#39;t equip it so I will try to trade it for<br/>
something I can use.  But I really don&#39;t know what the thing is worth.  I<br/>
know it varies from server to server and I am on Innoruuk.  But any idea<br/>
would help me.<br/>
