<div id="ygrps-yiv-920087280">At level 30 GF caught me whilst I was medding and I couldn&#39;t outrun him<br/>
even with MM drums, I didn&#39;t think at the time to run for the guard tower<br/>
which I believe is the only way of getting away from him, the guards will<br/>
attack him and the dmg the deal would be enough to taunt GF away from you,<br/>
however better run though cos GF will dispatch of them guards with some<br/>
health to spare and is likely to come beat on you after the guards are<br/>
chow.<br/>

Another update for you speed freaks:<br/>
<br/>
Having run past GrimFeather a few days ago and made it safely to zone, I<br/>
got<br/>
cocky.  Last night I was killing time waiting for a friend and picked GF up<br/>
on track again.  I decided I&#39;d try to kite him (level 36, MM drums, using<br/>
Fufil&#39;s because the range is sooooo much better than Bellow) and got a<br/>
nasty<br/>
surprise.  Yes, I am faster than him.  No, I am not fast enough to kite him<br/>
- even very shallow turns brought me into his range (which is a lot farther<br/>
than other griffs - more like a giant).  He hits *at least* as hard as HGs,<br/>
and seems to double attack a lot more.  Well, I ended up in a crumpled blue<br/>
heap on a hillside in NK, and learned a little humility. = )  I have rather<br/>
a lot of experience kiting (made most of my experience from 15 to 21 that<br/>
way), and I must admit that this is something toward the top of my &quot;must do<br/>
someday&quot; list - gotta prove to myself I can do it.  On the other hand, I&#39;m<br/>
not suicidal, and I&#39;ll wait until 40+ and maybe upgrade to Selo&#39;s Drum<br/>
first... &lt;drool&gt;<br/>
