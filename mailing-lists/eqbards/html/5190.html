<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511454772">I definitely have to agree with you on this one John.  Whatever happened did<br/>
increase the amount of missed notes encountered, OR, they replaced the<br/>
random number generator with one that was even more clumpy than before,<br/>
though I doubt that.  I usually see 1 missed note on a Selo&#39;s per night<br/>
previously.  Now it is not uncommon for me to see 2-3 consecutive missed<br/>
notes on Selo&#39;s in a 3-5 hour session.  Before the last month or so I never<br/>
saw 2-3 consecutive missed notes on Selo&#39;s, never, ever.<br/>

&gt; Not really. Your own mind can start noticing things it never noticed<br/>
before<br/>
&gt; completly unintentionally. An example of this is whenever i learn a new<br/>
&gt; word... it pops up all over the place. Before i just glanced over it and<br/>
&gt; ignored it, but now it stands out like a signil fire. I would guess the<br/>
&gt; same thing is hapenning here... and that nothing has changed, except maybe<br/>
&gt; a *lessening* of missed notes as verant documented on the higher level<br/>
&gt; songs. Some individual simply had a bad experiance and could not get selos<br/>
&gt; started because he happened to have a bad roll of the dice at an<br/>
&gt; inopportune time. And from that point on it just snowballed down hill and<br/>
&gt; he started to notice the missed notes because he was now thinking about<br/>
&gt; them unconsciously all the time. <br/>
<br/>
Please, it was *real*.  It was EXTREMELY frustrating, enough<br/>
that after two 3-5 hour nights of it (it wasn&#39;t one instantce<br/>
of me being unable to get Selo&#39;s started) I quit my bard for<br/>
almost a week and played my enchanter instead.  When I finally<br/>
played my bard again, the problem was *still* there.  I&#39;d been<br/>
planning on switching to my enchanter again, but my friends on<br/>
my bard server just got a guild started last night so I hopped<br/>
in to join the guild and play a bit, and the problem was gone.<br/>
<br/>
I can normally stack 3 songs no problem, sometimes 4.  During<br/>
the time I was having this missed note problem, I could only<br/>
keep 2 song icons up consistently, and sometimes manage 3.  <br/>
It was that bad.  Running the numbers, at a 5% missed note<br/>
rate, you should be able to play 3 songs without a missed note<br/>
85% of the time.  With a 20% missed note rate (which was my<br/>
original estimate, but I stated it as 10%-20% because I *know*<br/>
the mind has a tendency to overestimate these things) you can<br/>
only play 3 songs without a mised note 51% of the time.  That<br/>
fits my observations of keeping 3 songs going, so my 20%<br/>
estimate was probably pretty accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I minored in social and cognitive psychology in undergrad.  <br/>
My graduate thesis topic was a statistical analysis of data<br/>
channel capacity in high-latency high-loss environments.  I<br/>
*know* the tricks your mind can play on you, and I *know* how<br/>
it&#39;s easy to mistake statistically random data for something<br/>
else.  This was NOT my imagination, it was real.<br/>
