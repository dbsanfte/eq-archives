&gt; and secondly, if you thought<br/>
&gt; DDD was useless (which it may be in most situations, although <br/>
&gt; for those folks who<br/>
&gt; always complain they have nothing to do in enchanter groups, <br/>
&gt; this seems like something<br/>
&gt; that might be worthwhile) that you must also think HT is useless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think Adam is right, there is always something better to do than DDD.<br/>
