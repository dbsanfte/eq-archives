<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512835989">To all my fellow bards,<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t have time to write this mail as I would like so I will be brief and ask for your understanding if I miss the gramatical and spelling issues I would normally correct.  I also beg your indulgence on what is not exactly a bard issue but certainly does deal with this list.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago now there was a post by Steelwolf that pretty heavily slammed down on a fellow bard about problems with our class the title being something along the lines of &quot;Bard sit in or mana song out&quot;.  I found the tone and the wording of the letter inappropriate and harsh both to the person it was written to and the bard list in general.  In responce I took it upon myself to address the issue and slammed Steelwolf back down fairly hard although I think constructively, however Steelwolf I do want to apologise for it I should have been more kind in the admonishment if I was going to post it at all.  On the other hand I think you knew what I meant because the rest of your posts have been much more expressive of your point and constructive with idea&#39;s as I tried to support with my reply to your level 17 lullaby post.  <br/>
<br/>
With that said and a sincere apology again to Steelwolf, I&#39;m going to agian take it on myself to say something this time however not to just one person but to all of us including myself.  We all come from different area&#39;s upbringings, age groups, value systems.  We all share a love for gaming, our characters, and I feel safe to say a love for the class of character we on this list all share, The Bard.  My point in this is to say that this list has begun to degenerate at times to a step just above but very close to flaming.  It&#39;s not something I want to see.  I tend to belive most of the rest of us don&#39;t want to see it either.  There are going to be differences of opinion it&#39;s natural, how we express them is what is key.  There is no cause to beat someone with a different opinion on something down even if you hold that opinion very strongly in the opposite direction.  <br/>
<br/>
Lets hear eachother out take the list like a buffet go get what you like and leave the rest in peace.  If you want to be part of the greater &quot;concensus&quot; then by all means try and state your view and show it&#39;s merit, but do NOT do it in such a manner as to insult or berate someone else.  I&#39;m at times as guilty as others of it so I&#39;m not trying to be a preacher, I just don&#39;t want to see anyone feel unwelcome because in the end it&#39;s all about fun.  One last comment, No this isn&#39;t about being thought or word police it&#39;s about giving the respect you would expect for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Adon<br/>

Ohh and Steelwolf thanks for all the really great posts and again sorry for being heavy handed.</div>
