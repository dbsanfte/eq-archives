&gt; slime crystal staves is nothing spectacular (5/28), they are<br/>
&gt; good weapons to pull out every couple levels to top off your<br/>
&gt; 1h-blunt skill.  The *optimal* 1h blunt bard weapon to do this<br/>
&gt; past about level 20 would probably be a cold iron morningstar<br/>
&gt; (9/38? 9/35? and 4.5 lbs), but it&#39;s a rare drop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to disagree, the cold iron morningstar is not the rare loot, the runed<br/>
circlet is... On the same rare spawn, but he carry the morningstar a lot more<br/>
than the circlet...<br/>
<br/>
I whent there with my friend to get him a circlet... we had 3 morningstars<br/>
before we finaly got a circlet...<br/>
<br/>
But it is the perfect weapon to increase your Blunt, and a full party of low to<br/>
mid 20 can get it... And it is 9/35... not bad. Don&#39;t know if it is camped now,<br/>
probably. I whent there when it was not on the web yet...<br/>
<br/>
Now for anyone that hate crowded place, Upper guk is great. I still hunt in<br/>
there, and at lvl 29, they are some yellow frog... They are some named frog that<br/>
little people know about, like the &quot;Froglock Summoner&quot;. You hate to have to<br/>
recharm your pet, just summon yourself a fire elemental pet...<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting.<br/>
