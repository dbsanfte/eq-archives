<div id="ygrps-yiv-863676870">I echo Roop&#39;s comments.  I think level 15 is well beyond the lifespan of a mino<br/>
Axe.  I bought a combine longsword around that time which enabled me to fight<br/>
invulnerable critters as well as being a fine all around weapon.  I also started<br/>
developing some secondary weapon skills in anticipation of level 17.  I decided<br/>
that a rapier is great weapon because of its speed.  When I got dual wield I<br/>
started using a combine longsword in one hand and a rapier or main-gauche in the<br/>
other.  For tough battles I used the longword in the dominant hand, but for easy<br/>
battles I switch hands to get more opportunities to improve the poorer skill.<br/>
You can find lots of bronze rapiers and main-gauches at the Dervish Cutthroat<br/>
camp in west commons.  I have not upgraded the rapier to a combine yet, but I<br/>
will soon.<br/>
