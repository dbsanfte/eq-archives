<div id="ygrps-yiv-385658672">Supposedly this spell gets more power as you advance, does anyone know to<br/>
what extent?  Initally in the lower levels 1-6 I found this spell to be a<br/>
great way to kill myself, either in attracting that ever popular guard you<br/>
forgot patrolled your area of the incredible &quot;there he is that guy, everyone<br/>
get him!&quot; attraction feature of this song.  But lately at 9th I&#39;ve had alot<br/>
of fun practicing my String skill and nuking lvl 1 characters in the newbie<br/>
areas of freeport.  But I&#39;m curious just how much damage does this song<br/>
actually do anyways?  I&#39;ve been using it more and more in the desert taking<br/>
spiders and such.  Makes for a great helper if you think you&#39;re not gonna<br/>
make it out alive.  Sure you have to be sure nothing else is around<br/>
otherwise you&#39;ll be double/tripple teamed by creatures but even still I<br/>
finally feel like its a useful spell.  Also in a party does this spell also<br/>
do damage to members in your party as well?<br/>
