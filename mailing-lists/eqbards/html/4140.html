&gt; Sorry, I just had to reply to this, and then I&#39;ll let the subject drop<br/>
&gt; forever. Enough has been said about twinking. I have to say, you have to be<br/>
&gt; a real jerk to give somebody flak because they are twinked. This is called<br/>
&gt; JEALOUSY folks. Get over it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>
out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>
when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;ll repeat what I said last time:  The real meta-issue<br/>
behind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>
weren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>
because the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>
