<div id="ygrps-yiv-492145130"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE - why<br/>
&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>even worse, i was down in runnyeye over the weekend standing around<br/>
in a room waiting for some tougher monsters to spawn. I wasn&#39;t singing any<br/>
songs, and goblins that weren&#39;t in the same room would detect me and i&#39;d<br/>
hear the &quot;Half-elves like you have no place in our room&quot;. about 3 or 4<br/>
minutes later a horde of about 8 goblins would burst into the room and go<br/>
ape-shit on me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty unfair that goblins that couldn&#39;t see me would come after me<br/>
when i wasn&#39;t doing anything to them, especially since it wasn&#39;t happening<br/>
to anyone else in the room.<br/>
