<div id="ygrps-yiv-911894641">Gak.  I hate beggers, but I also don&#39;t play anon unles my guild is in the<br/>
Planes, so I get a lot of tells from &quot;newbies&quot; wanting free handouts.  I,<br/>
like Harmonic, try to answer every tell that comes to me regardless whether<br/>
it&#39;s a 50 Paladin asking me to go to Plane of Sky or a level 1 monk named<br/>
&quot;Jakrabit&quot;.  What I have settle into telling the beggers, and seems to work<br/>
well (i.e. they don&#39;t flame me afterwards) is &quot;/t jakrabit I&#39;m sorry, I have<br/>
a policy against giving handouts.  If I gave stuff to everyone that asked<br/>
I&#39;d have nothing myself.  Nothing personal.&quot;<br/>

&gt; server; or perhaps the influx of XMas newbies with no understanding of the<br/>
&gt; dynamics of the game; but it seems like the past couple months I seem to<br/>
&gt; constantly get begs from new characters for me to give them stuff.<br/>
