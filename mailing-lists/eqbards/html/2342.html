&gt;actually ,, I hear quite often &quot;Bards Rock&quot;  just after joining a group in<br/>
&gt;need of healing ,, or is going on a long journey,,,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;of course ,,, when I group with a druid ,,, my first words are &quot;Druids <br/>
&gt;Rock&quot;<br/>
&gt;I love those buffs<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s amazing how far honest appreciation and sincere flattery will get <br/>
you. A couple of days ago I had someone lay a full complement of buff spells <br/>
on me just because I told them they had an awesome looking shield :0) when <br/>
they were fighting near me.<br/>
