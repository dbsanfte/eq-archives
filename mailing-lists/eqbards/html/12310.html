<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218903003">well  i wish you luck on this event, i do know however that you will not be <br/>
seeing mayong unless a gm takes control of him and brings him out to play. <br/>
Mayong is currently in the game, albeit in an area which is not reachable by <br/>
players due to pathing problems. there was a huge thread a while back on the <br/>
kunark message board about &quot;mysteries of norrath&quot; and somone posted a quote <br/>
from one of the verant people saying we couldn&#39;t get to mayong.<br/>
<br/>
I guess one possiblity is that if mayong is somewhere in the zone in reach <br/>
of an aoe spell/song you might tag him that way and get him to come out, but <br/>
i would guess that is not the case.there is always a chance that a gm could <br/>
show up with him however, so good luck. either way it sounds like fun.<br/>

&gt;Subject: The Summoning of Mayong Mistmoore (E&#39;ci server)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the E&#39;ci bards:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guildmaster of the Kelethin Songweavers Guild decided enough was <br/>
&gt;enough.<br/>
&gt;He had just gotten word of another bard messenger slain in Lesser Faydark.<br/>
&gt;That made four over the past two weeks.  Like all the others, the puncture<br/>
&gt;wounds of a vampire attack were visible on the messenger&#39;s neck.  It<br/>
&gt;appeared that the rumors coming out of Lesser Faydark were true, Mayong<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore was back on the prowl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For months, numerous intrepid adventurers had entered into Mayong&#39;s estate<br/>
&gt;only to find him mysteriously in hiding.  Despite forays deep into the<br/>
&gt;bowels of Mayong&#39;s fortress, evidence of his existence were nowhere to be<br/>
&gt;found.  The reports of his absence conflicted directly with the evidence:<br/>
&gt;four dead bards.  If only Mayong could be taunted to appear, then perhaps<br/>
&gt;Norrath could be rid of his evil presence once and for all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Knowing of Mayong&#39;s deep hatred of bards, what better way, the guildmaster<br/>
&gt;decided, to taunt him into appearing than to hold a convention of bards in<br/>
&gt;his own backyard.  With a concert of all Norrathian bards filling the halls<br/>
&gt;of Mistmoore Castle with lyric and verse, Mayong&#39;s only option will be to<br/>
&gt;personally end the concert himself.  Now, if only he could enlist the<br/>
&gt;assistance of the other Kelethin guild leaders...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OOC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After reading everywhere about the raids into PoF, PoH, Kedge etc, I <br/>
&gt;decided<br/>
&gt;it might be nice if we had a raid/server event in a different zone<br/>
&gt;accessible to lower level players.  I figured Mistmoore is a good choice<br/>
&gt;since the last couple of times I have been in it there weren&#39;t many people<br/>
&gt;in the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as I know, Mayong has never spawned on E&#39;ci.  The way I see it, <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;are two possible explanations.  First, by design he isn&#39;t in the game and<br/>
&gt;will never spawn unless Verant includes him in a future patch.  Second, the<br/>
&gt;groups camping the castle haven&#39;t done what it takes and/or held the castle<br/>
&gt;long enough to get him to spawn.  Perhaps Mayong will spawn if his<br/>
&gt;placeholder is killed enough by a party holding the castle.  I am hoping <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;second option holds true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I petitioned and asked a guide if they could support a player run event <br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;this.  I had hoped that if the level of participation was high enough,<br/>
&gt;Verant would participate and spawn Mayong for us.  So far I have been<br/>
&gt;unsuccessful in getting official support lined up.  Still working on that<br/>
&gt;though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The primary goal of this event is to successfully raid the castle and hold<br/>
&gt;it for an extended period of time.  In other words, once we start the raid<br/>
&gt;nobody has to zone out due to a train.  In order to meet this goal, here is<br/>
&gt;what I have in mind:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lake area:  Three groups in the low 20s to control the spawns in the lake<br/>
&gt;area and between the lake and graveyard.<br/>
&gt;Graveyard: Two groups.  One group in the mid 20s to control the graveyard.<br/>
&gt;One group in the low 20s to pull from the path between the lake and<br/>
&gt;graveyard.<br/>
&gt;Secret room behind crypt: One group in their low-mid 30s<br/>
&gt;Courtyard: Two groups in the mid-high 30s to control all the spawns in that<br/>
&gt;area plus the ramp leading up to the castle.<br/>
&gt;Castle:  At least four groups 40-50 to control the entire castle.  This<br/>
&gt;requirement is open to suggestion because I&#39;m not high enough level to know<br/>
&gt;what it takes to control the house.<br/>
&gt;Reserve:  One group (levels TBD) on standby to assist any group in need.<br/>
&gt;Healers:  A couple of clerics not in a group on standby to give EXP resses<br/>
&gt;to anyone who needs it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s the kicker to keep it in line with the storyline: whenever possible,<br/>
&gt;each group has at least one bard in it.  Of course if your regular group of<br/>
&gt;six doesn&#39;t include a bard then you don&#39;t have to break up your group.  As<br/>
&gt;an alternative, there will be bards there not in a group to temporarily <br/>
&gt;join<br/>
&gt;with a group after a combat to help them regen mana faster (assuming no<br/>
&gt;enchanter in the group).  Once mana regen is complete bard can disband and<br/>
&gt;6th person can rejoin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Proposed date: 15 January 2000, starting at 3PM CST.  Official time/date<br/>
&gt;confirmed once level of participation is known.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Known constraints: 1) Mistmoore is known to be a buggy zone so not really<br/>
&gt;certain how many people it can handle without causing lag problems.  2)  <br/>
&gt;Too<br/>
&gt;many people may show up.  Will have to rely on cooperation of everyone<br/>
&gt;involved to ensure everyone has a good time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Feedback:  Request players with lots of experience fighting inside the<br/>
&gt;castle to send me advice on the number of groups required to safely hold <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;castle.  Also request advice from players that have organized successful<br/>
&gt;raids on how to handle the coordination aspects of an event like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you or your group is interested in participating, please send me a<br/>
&gt;private email to the following email address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bamadude@...">bamadude@...</a><br/>
