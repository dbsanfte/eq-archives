To answer your question, instrument soloing isn&#39;t typically done until you<br/>
get Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord at level 18.  At that point, you can do a<br/>
three song twist of DDD, HoR, and CoD with the appropriate instruments for<br/>
more raw damage output with healing than a typical untwinked bard can do<br/>
with weapons.<br/>
