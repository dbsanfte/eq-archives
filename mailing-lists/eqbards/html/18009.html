<div id="ygrps-yiv-234543034">if you mean lullaby, starting off that song isn&#39;t too effective.  it starts<br/>
to be useful around 21+.  it&#39;s a great taunt tho when you need it.  (i went<br/>
for weeks wondering what the song did)  strings do help A LOT.  if you just<br/>
got the song, i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;ll become effective enough to be reliable.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Mez song<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried out my mez song for the first time in the maze fighting minos and<br/>
them damn mud things. Well any ways. As soon as I got they blink message I<br/>
got it has woren off. My cha is 106, and so level I am I thought that was<br/>
good. So I was wondering do I have to use strings with the song to make it<br/>
work? Or dose this song just bite?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
If any one has some info they wish to part on this matter please do! :)<br/>
thanks a bunch<br/>
