<div id="ygrps-yiv-861905237">Never bought that song either ;-)  I agree it&#39;s also totally useless.<br/>
Especially since when it&#39;s most useful you will be playing Selo&#39;s and would<br/>
have to twist it. :-p<br/>

deception or <br/>
guise of the deceiver, they don&#39;t get a song at level 24 then (ultravision<br/>
song).<br/>
how about if we compare the ratio of human bards with no mask to the total<br/>
number of bards with the ratio of pvp players to non pvp players?<br/>
