&gt; &gt; 	To many, such practices seem &quot;elitist&quot;.  I can definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand why someone would think that, some of my guildmates do act with<br/>
&gt; &gt; that kind of attitude.  But there IS a logical reason for not inviting<br/>
&gt; &gt; outside people, in addition to the fact that inter-guild co-ordination is<br/>
&gt; &gt; alot of work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;ve seen done is for the multi-guild coordinated party<br/>
&gt; to take over the /ooc or /auction channel and use that for<br/>
&gt; coordination in lieu of /guildsay.  (/shout too, but that can<br/>
&gt; get annoying for others in the zone.)<br/>

did a multi-guild Vox trip this past Sunday. Our guild leader had<br/>
invited the other high level guild on Tribunal to send people as well.<br/>
Knowing him, I&#39;m sure he told them in advance to get cold resist gear.<br/>
At the appointed gathering time, most of our guild was outside perma,<br/>
while the other guild&#39;s members straggled in over the next hour or so. I<br/>
didn&#39;t see one person with more than the basic player made CR jewellery<br/>
while most of the people who came from our guild had that plus froglok<br/>
crowns, gnomish environment suits, icy greaves and other gear that gave<br/>
them a much better chance to survive.<br/>
