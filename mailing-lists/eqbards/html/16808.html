Whoa.  Talk about reading more into a message that the author<br/>
intended.  I never said he was a fool.  I said the buyer was<br/>
probably laughing all the way to the bank because he knew he&#39;d<br/>
taken advantage of him.<br/>

and<br/>
&gt; put down on.  He chose to do it, it&#39;s over.  He knows he could have made<br/>

&gt; Picking on him about it really is out of line.  Especially when I&#39;m sure<br/>

I&#39;m not picking on him.  I&#39;m confirming that the true value of<br/>
these things is in the 25-35pp range.  I don&#39;t care what he<br/>
chooses to do with that knowledge.  I just wanted to be sure<br/>
he knew the true value, because I hate jerks who take<br/>
advantage of newbies ignorant about prices.<br/>
