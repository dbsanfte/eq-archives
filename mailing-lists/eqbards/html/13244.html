<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640523853">Just a short observation. I think this was in Rathe Mountains, as I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen a cyclops or giant skel in Lake Rathe zone.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I agree very much with your advice. I&#39;m pretty much a &quot;pick up&quot; player<br/>
and pretty much solo or just group up with 1 other person just because of<br/>
these types of incidences.<br/>
<br/>
However, because of my lack of grouping experience I&#39;m trying to get in more<br/>
groups. I&#39;m kind of picky myself:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m annoyed by any type of &quot;d00d&quot; talk like &quot;Watzzup&quot;. Yea, I&#39;m kind of<br/>
uptight at times and I don&#39;t say anything. I just remember not to group with<br/>
this guy in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I like to know what is &quot;inc&quot; so I can have the right songs up.<br/>
<br/>
I like if they are in a guild so I can log them down whether their<br/>
representative is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;ll<br/>
be good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m annoyed by casters who get the mobs on them in the opening parts of a<br/>
battle and we have to try to pull the mob off of them.<br/>
<br/>
Slow typists. I hate talking with someone and having to wait a long time to<br/>
get a response. I try to be patient, especially since English might not be<br/>
their native tongue. But this does drive my crazy since I&#39;m a decent touch<br/>
typist. Maybe &quot;Roger Wilco&quot; (internet voice chatting) is the answer for<br/>
them. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also know that I myself do not always do the right thing (I&#39;m working on<br/>
these)<br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
After waiting a long time for puller to come back (because they can&#39;t find<br/>
anything) I&#39;ll get antsy and &quot;look around&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When getting absolutely crushed by something, I&#39;ve hopped around trying to<br/>
get it off of me. Not one of my finer moments. I&#39;ll learn. It&#39;s a carryover<br/>
from my soloing - when you&#39;re getting nailed, fire up the jets and get<br/>
going. I&#39;m working on just standing there and going &quot;stealth&quot; mode by<br/>
turning off my songs and stop attacking, then if that doesn&#39;t work back away<br/>
in a straight line to get out of their aggro radius.<br/>
<br/>
In battle I&#39;m sometimes turning off my songs before they can activate. Doh!<br/>
Keeping my eyes on the scrolling words.<br/>
<br/>
Drop my damn weapon/instrument when swapping from hotkeys. (addressed by<br/>
others, but I&#39;m trying to be more careful anyway. Oh, and lag makes this<br/>
easy to do too!)<br/>
<br/>
Things I want to improve on:<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
Charming - I have the hardest time after charming something to target<br/>
something else (I usually use key for &quot;target closest npc&quot;) and tell it to<br/>
attack (hot key) and then retarget my &quot;pet&quot; (essentially the &quot;tab&quot; key).<br/>
What&#39;s even harder, is that I have to set this all up by warning my group<br/>
that I&#39;m &quot;charming&quot;. It&#39;s hard enough to warn them much less say &quot;what&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
charming. I just try to target something that isn&#39;t being wacked or blasted,<br/>
pretty intuitive. If anyone has suggestions, I&#39;d appreciate. I know this has<br/>
been posted before, but I didn&#39;t keep the message. BTW - outdoors this isn&#39;t<br/>
all that bad, since I use 3rd person perspective. But in a dungeon, man it&#39;s<br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
Weapons or Instruments - I alternate between both depending on the<br/>
situation, but I&#39;m still working on learning what those situations are. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Song Selection - Still learning which songs to keep memorized depending on<br/>
where I&#39;m at. An art to itself. :-) I&#39;ll be happy when our mem times drop so<br/>
my groupmates don&#39;t have to wait as I ponder my song selection.<br/>
<br/>
Things I don&#39;t want to hear anymore:<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Play that mana song - I hate having to explain that I have 5 more levels<br/>
before I get it, followed by gripes about how long it takes for them to med<br/>
to full mana. I&#39;m sympathetic as I&#39;ve got a Magician, but that means I&#39;m<br/>
just more chatty while I sit there staring at my book. Too bad you couldn&#39;t<br/>
play a dvd or go web surfing over your magic book. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Definite weakness:<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what can I say, I enjoy grouping up with female characters. Yea,<br/>
they&#39;re most likely guys who are playing them, but since I don&#39;t see or see<br/>
them, it&#39;s fine by me. As long as they know how to fight in a group.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, I&#39;ve gone on too long already. Bye!<br/>

&gt; members.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Joshua R. Moore&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:josh@...">josh@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /rant on<br/>
&gt; Let me give you an example of what to look out for. The <br/>
&gt; dreaded &quot;I&#39;m a level<br/>
&gt; xx Ranger/Druid that has never grouped before, and I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have to work<br/>
&gt; within the group&quot; dewdz.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Went to Lake Rathe to seek a group of Stalwart Adventurers to <br/>
&gt; help me in my<br/>
&gt; quest to slay Cyclopses.<br/>
&gt; I pick up a level 24 druid,Shaman, and a level 25 warrior, a level 24<br/>
&gt; warrior, and another druid. (26 at the time)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am the puller, and We are doing great. Putting the smack down on<br/>
&gt; Cyclopses, I fear away the very rare bad pull. Druids go link <br/>
&gt; dead. I pick<br/>
&gt; up a mage and a Necromancer. We do even better! We take <br/>
&gt; Tarsluk(sp) out<br/>
&gt; twice, a two Cyclops pull. Everything is going great, until I <br/>
&gt; go link dead.<br/>
&gt; I came back, and half the group is dead. Some unknown player <br/>
&gt; trained us with<br/>
&gt; some cyclopses, from what I hear, he/she kept running back <br/>
&gt; through us, until<br/>
&gt; the things aggord on my party.<br/>
&gt; The warrior has to leave after we recoup from that loss, and <br/>
&gt; the Mage asks<br/>
&gt; if her Ranger friend can join. (Wood elf ranger)<br/>
&gt; We agree, and she starts bitching when I pull in the giant <br/>
&gt; skeletons (as<br/>
&gt; anyone knows, when you want cyclopses, you have to pull in the Giant<br/>
&gt; Skellies and other yard trash) She decides she is going to <br/>
&gt; pull, because I<br/>
&gt; am doing a horrible job.<br/>
&gt; (Let me explain the basic group strategy to this point. We <br/>
&gt; help each other.<br/>
&gt; NO one dies, no one runs unless everyone does. We pull to our <br/>
&gt; spot, and<br/>
&gt; support one another.) She brings in a Cyclops, draws it near <br/>
&gt; us, and begins<br/>
&gt; to kite the damn thing around the valley, making the <br/>
&gt; Necromancer and mage<br/>
&gt; pets, me, and the Warrior, chase the damn Cyclops around to <br/>
&gt; try and get a<br/>
&gt; hit on it, while she casts flame lick or some stupid spell on <br/>
&gt; it. All the<br/>
&gt; while, im yelling stay still, along with all the <br/>
&gt; others(Except the mage, of<br/>
&gt; course). It decides to finally die, after all the fuss <br/>
&gt; attracted another<br/>
&gt; Cyclops, which the warrior and I managed to tank somehow with all the<br/>
&gt; casters being OOM. I explain to her that we are a group, and <br/>
&gt; we work as a<br/>
&gt; group, and support one another. She says we need to learn to <br/>
&gt; &quot;play with<br/>
&gt; them&quot;. Needless to say, over private tell to me, the other <br/>
&gt; group members<br/>
&gt; (Except the mage, of course) are not impressed with the <br/>
&gt; ranger&#39;s ability.<br/>
&gt; I go to pull again, after being asked to, and I start <br/>
&gt; bringing in a Cyclops<br/>
&gt; (I sing chain to pull them. It stops them from aggroing on <br/>
&gt; anyone else while<br/>
&gt; you are pulling, and slows them down quite a bit.) and I get <br/>
&gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; party, after stating &quot;Incoming Cyclops&quot;. Someone yells over <br/>
&gt; Shout that there<br/>
&gt; is a Half dead Cyclops at the zone. So, guess what? Miss <br/>
&gt; Queen kiting of<br/>
&gt; Norrath runs off screaming &quot;Ill get it&quot; just as the other <br/>
&gt; Cyclops gets to<br/>
&gt; us. We engage this one, stating that we are fighting this Cyclops, and<br/>
&gt; begging her to come and help. She brings in her Cyclops, and it starts<br/>
&gt; Hammering on me. So, I chain the Cyclops we are fighting, <br/>
&gt; tell the group to<br/>
&gt; fight the one we are on and fire up fear. Off runs the <br/>
&gt; cyclopses, with one<br/>
&gt; being extremely slow. We start to fight that one, and the <br/>
&gt; Ranger runs off<br/>
&gt; after the other Cyclops!<br/>
&gt; Needless to say.. Everyone in the group had to zone. I called <br/>
&gt; the retreat,<br/>
&gt; and started up fear again. Rangeress screams that we could <br/>
&gt; take them. I<br/>
&gt; explain, yes, we could have, if you had been working WITH us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very shortly after that, I disbanded the group, after the <br/>
&gt; mage said in tell<br/>
&gt; to me &quot;Well, I like grouping with her. I have never died <br/>
&gt; before when with<br/>
&gt; her alone. it must be you guys&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /rant off<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.Give the group(or perspective member) a trial period, in <br/>
&gt; which you observe<br/>
&gt; how they(him) work within the group. Do they support one <br/>
&gt; another(the other<br/>
&gt; members)? Do they seem to follow the group leaders lead?(Your lead)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.Observe how they talk. are they snide, and flippent? Do they heal<br/>
&gt; themselves first, no matter if someone is lower on health? do they<br/>
&gt; constantly complain about loot levels/Exp?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bottom line is, a group leaders job, in my opinion, is to <br/>
&gt; keep the group<br/>
&gt; alive at all costs, whenever possible. When a group member <br/>
&gt; jeopardizes this,<br/>
&gt; it is time to either leave the group, or Dismiss the group member.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have had a lot of time lately as a group leader. (If ye <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t find groups<br/>
&gt; to join.. make yer own!*grin*) It is the group leaders job to <br/>
&gt; determine what<br/>
&gt; the party can handle safely. To judge the groups abilities <br/>
&gt; through different<br/>
&gt; levels of combat.<br/>
&gt; A smart group leader does not test his party unless all Mana <br/>
&gt; users are at<br/>
&gt; full, and all are at full health, and are ready.<br/>
&gt; It is the leaders job to weed out the bad seeds, and forge a <br/>
&gt; strong group.<br/>
&gt; do so politely, and with honor. Let actions be the judge<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have also been in a lot of pickup groups. Best advice I can give is.<br/>
&gt; Watch, listen, work in the group. do as the group leader asks. suggest<br/>
&gt; tactics if you wish, but do not force them down their throat. <br/>
&gt; If you judge<br/>
&gt; the group wanting, take your leave. politely!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but above all else. have fun! but not at other group members expense<br/>
&gt; (playing with a dangerous mob, etc)<br/>
&gt; It is a game, and things are meant to be fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A group that works together, stays alive, and has fun<br/>

&gt; From: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:legba@...">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen a few posts lately about some good groups and nights.  These<br/>
&gt; are cool and tell things to look for when I&#39;m in a group (my bard<br/>
&gt; basically plays in all pickup groups right now, I play very<br/>
&gt; erractically, though this weekend was great, made almost 2 lvls!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the ugly question.  What should I look for to help me <br/>
&gt; identify a bad<br/>
&gt; group.  Not having gate, its helpful to make pretty quick <br/>
&gt; judments on a<br/>
&gt; group since its hard to get out sometimes (in dungeons).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example Monday I was with two others (enchanter and shaman) who I<br/>
&gt; had done great with the night before.  We picked up three tanks (A<br/>
&gt; uber-twinkie warrior, exec axe/crafted at lvl 17, monk and a ranger). <br/>
&gt; Playing it safe ( I thought) we were turbo pulling on orc highway (if<br/>
&gt; you dont know they are lvl 12-16ish with an occasional &quot;a orc warrior&quot;<br/>
&gt; which are like lvl 20 I think, red to me at 15).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fifteen minutes in (the enchant, shaman and I had been together for an<br/>
&gt; hour Monday, but a lvl 15 bard is a flimsy tank against DW <br/>
&gt; caimians and<br/>
&gt; crocs).  We heard a &quot;xxxx yells for help&quot;.  All but the monk (out<br/>
&gt; pulling) get up, and see the usual.  A soloist mistakingly <br/>
&gt; pulled on of<br/>
&gt; the &quot;a orc&quot;s.  We pile on, as the shaman warns the puller we <br/>
&gt; have a big<br/>
&gt; fight (these are pretty rough even with a full group).  We have it<br/>
&gt; beaten down, both casters OOM, but health is fine, when I look up from<br/>
&gt; key mashing and see mine dropping.  Ugh, DB skel decided he didnt like<br/>
&gt; my music.  Three /g&#39;s of &quot;Help the bard&quot; from our shaman (he&#39;s good!<br/>
&gt; noticed my health before I did), and I am still solo on the DB down to<br/>
&gt; 1.5 bubs.  Eventually the enchanter&#39;s pet manages to get the DB off<br/>
&gt; me(lucky I guess).  At which point the ranger says &quot;Anthem!&quot;. <br/>
&gt;  (I assume<br/>
&gt; he finally noticed all the nifty flashing icons were off his <br/>
&gt; screen, as<br/>
&gt; I was getting the crap stunned out of me).  Shaman reminds <br/>
&gt; the tank that<br/>
&gt; their fair haired bard is the lowest lvl in the group and not <br/>
&gt; much good<br/>
&gt; at absorbing damage.  (I tend to not say anything, so he has taken on<br/>
&gt; the role for me)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life goes on...  ABout half hour later, I decide to experiment with<br/>
&gt; kabonging.  With all this muscle (even the shaman out damages me with<br/>
&gt; his big hammer), I felt my damage wasn&#39;t mattering much and <br/>
&gt; we might be<br/>
&gt; better served if I just use the old mandolin.  So I weave Hymm and<br/>
&gt; Chordx2 in battle (I only triple in a big fight as it gives me a<br/>
&gt; headache), with my mandolin in hand.  After a big pull (2 priests and<br/>
&gt; warriors), I am pretty well smushed (below 1 bub), so I&#39;m sitting with<br/>
&gt; Hymm going.  I watch the ranger top himself off with heals (the other<br/>
&gt; tanks were down around 2 bubs), then cast the damage shield <br/>
&gt; on himself. <br/>
&gt; I tell the enchanter and shaman, &quot;Time to Jettison this trash?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In any case what are some good things to look for so I know <br/>
&gt; when to bail<br/>
&gt; out?  The group I met on Sunday was great (we played about 6 <br/>
&gt; hours with<br/>
&gt; 0 deaths in a low-risk zone, closest call was me being saved by a rune<br/>
&gt; spell, 2 hp left!), but I think they will out level me too quickly<br/>
&gt; (which is usually my problem, any good players I meet out level me<br/>
&gt; quickly, guess I should figure out where I stand)<br/>
&gt; -- <br/>
&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
