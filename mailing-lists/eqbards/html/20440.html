<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606454071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lake of Ill Omens contains plentiful mobs in all levels from <br/>
&gt; level 3-4 thru<br/>
&gt; 27-29.  You just have to hunt in different regions.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that mobs for your level would be just to the right <br/>
&gt; of where the<br/>
&gt; river hits the lake. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm, maybe it was just a slow spawn night...that run through the<br/>
spiders/leaches is pretty scary though, yow. They ARE agro to younuns right?<br/>
Not a one attacked me but I figured I was just lucky.<br/>
