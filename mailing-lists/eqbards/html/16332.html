<div id="ygrps-yiv-811343204">This sounds all measured and reasonable.  Too bad about all of the postings I <br/>
read today (while wasting time at work) that stated that, when a guide was called <br/>
in to a list room, his &quot;solution&quot; was for the list group to rotate spawns with the <br/>
walk-ins.<br/>
<br/>
Both this rule and the KSing rule are very badly written.  I should not have to <br/>
rely on the mood of the guide that happens to be on at 4am on a Monday to decide <br/>
whether or not I&#39;m going to be warned for what is, to me, perfectly acceptable <br/>
behavior.  They should either write the rules to say what they mean, or they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have the rules.  This &quot;we&#39;ll intrepret it on the fly, trust us&quot; attitude <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be acceptable from a company that has GOOD customer service.<br/>

&gt; Found this posted on EQ Vault from a discussion with Gordon:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sharing Spawns<br/>
&gt; We do realize how long it takes. If I had my way, many items would be made<br/>
&gt; much more rare than they are, to the extent that no one would camp for them.<br/>
&gt; People would then do the dungeons, and if they got something cool it would<br/>
&gt; be a real reward.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, we&#39;re not going to force you to camp. However if you insist on camping,<br/>
&gt; then you&#39;ll need to deal with others who insist on camping in a civilized<br/>
&gt; manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These rules change nothing for people who already work well with others. For<br/>
&gt; instance, lets say you are camping something that always has a list going.<br/>
&gt; If someone new comes in, putting them on the list is perfectly acceptable,<br/>
&gt; much the same as you did before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These rules don&#39;t let them come in and demand that they get the next loot,<br/>
&gt; they only say that you need to work something out, or a GM/Guide will work<br/>
&gt; it out for you.<br/>
