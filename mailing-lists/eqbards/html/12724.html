    The problem is that 99.95 percent of the time NO PERSON on test knows<br/>
what to test. We aren&#39;t told the changes most of the time, and if something<br/>
is broke we dont know what to look for. We dont get a &quot; ok we did this &quot; now<br/>
go out and test to see if its stabe, exploitable, if it even works. We are<br/>
kept in the dark just as much as the rest of anyone else. And it is<br/>
unfortunate. I read a really great article to day over on the xrgaming<br/>
network about Asheron&#39;s Call&#39;s Dev team. Man i really wish that was a better<br/>
game...if EQ had AC&#39;s dev team we would have an awsome game and a much<br/>
better relationship between the customer and the MAN.<br/>

BTW about getting a character buffed to your present level on test? dont<br/>
hold your breath...they havent done anything like that since the population<br/>
explosion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I found the last statement to be very contradicting.  Hasn&#39;t the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; community, on numerous occasions to no avail, sent Verant extensive test<br/>
&gt; &gt; results proving that some of our songs weren&#39;t working properly?  Wonder<br/>
why<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are now asking players to send them test results when they seem to<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; ignored ours for the most part?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I just need an email address or a contact, and I&#39;m willing to give<br/>
&gt;   up a few hours a week to test changes on the Test Server with a bard<br/>
&gt;   comparable to the bard I currently play.  I don&#39;t know why they<br/>
&gt;   wouldn&#39;t take me up on it, it makes too much sense.  I&#39;ve got a lot<br/>
&gt;   of research background, and have very analytical approach to things.<br/>
&gt;   I do question everything and anything for it&#39;s validity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   No one before 1903 thought that humans would be flying, the idea<br/>
&gt;   was well accepted by the world as ridiculous, yet those people<br/>
&gt;   who questioned the idea made it happen.  Even before all that<br/>
&gt;   a person would be marked a loon if they didn&#39;t believe the Sun<br/>
&gt;   revolved around the Earth.  Such is the nature of this bard =)<br/>
