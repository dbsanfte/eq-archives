<div id="ygrps-yiv-831716572">Heh heh, I have a question do caster&#39;s get interrupted every time they are<br/>
bashed for 1 pt even when they are not stunned?  I know I lose my song<br/>
whenever bashed for damage.  I nearly died fighting three green no xp<br/>
zombies last nite because:<br/>
<br/>
	A) Every time I sang Lullaby they all nodded, and all happily<br/>
suffered no song<br/>
	   effect and kept bashing away.<br/>
<br/>
	B) Every time I tried to start another song I&#39;d get bashed for 1<br/>
point of damage <br/>
	   and have to start &#39;casting&#39; all over again.<br/>
<br/>
	C) Couldn&#39;t do enough damage to kill 3 green no xp mobs without<br/>
spells before <br/>
	   they did 4 bubbles to me.<br/>
<br/>
I mean wtf?  True they were barely no xp greens probably, but still.  What<br/>
good is crowd control if it does absolutely nothing.  If Lullaby isn&#39;t<br/>
broken it is seriously flawed.  Last nite was especially bad, more like<br/>
John(tm)&#39;s experiences with Kae where every green that nods is unaffected.<br/>
I must have nodded mobs over 200 times last nite that kept right on<br/>
attacking.  I guess they can just fight in their sleep or something.  After<br/>
four successive nods, a green no xp gnoll reaver finally went to sleep...<br/>
for one whole pulse.<br/>
