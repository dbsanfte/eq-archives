Concordance - 16% haste (or 13% delay reduction - you&#39;ll see<br/>
both figures tossed around as &quot;speedup&quot;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh.  My monk friend put on his FBSS and I dueled him<br/>
afterwards.  I was still grouped with him and played Anthem.<br/>
His punches were coming at max haste - every 2.0 seconds.  <br/>
Ouch!<br/>

appropriately.  That&#39;s what all the monks and rogues I&#39;ve<br/>
spoken to have said.<br/>
