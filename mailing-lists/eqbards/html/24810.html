<b>Subject:</b> RE: White Scales <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-349937068">We have 2 ways of getting white scales: Kill Gore and the person closest to<br/>
completeing their epic still needing the scale gets it. Take our twinks and<br/>
kill Vox, with the understanding the raid is for soandso&#39;s white scale. <br/>
Personally, I have only done the music sheets part. I&#39;m checking on Phin<br/>
regularly now as we&#39;ve killed him a couple times but no backbone so far. I<br/>
still need the skull from Karnors. I&#39;m told the warlord is camped pretty<br/>
solid. My cleric has an amy whip, so if multiquest doesn&#39;t get nerfed I&#39;m<br/>
good. Guild has a red scale for me they say and I have the metal bits. I do<br/>
wonder what changed with the addition of the Undead bard that can spawn<br/>
Trak. Forpar makes a lute neck and a body, but does he combine the 2 before<br/>
you get Trak guts now?<br/>
