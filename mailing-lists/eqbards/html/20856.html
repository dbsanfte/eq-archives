<div id="ygrps-yiv-339278310">All went well :)<br/>
<br/>
We did it the old fashoined way.  11 people (recruited a couple of guild<br/>
friends to make two full groups, our guild is short on muscle)<br/>
<br/>
They spent about an hour getting together and getting to the room where I<br/>
was imprisoned.  (while I was playing my iksar monk, got him from 8 to 10<br/>
running around the pit buffed out wazoo).<br/>
<br/>
From their we decided to go for the big camp (the church).  It was a great<br/>
guild night.  2 full groups, non stop multi mob pulls.  The boss (I forgot<br/>
his name) showed up once.  Unfortunatly the only warrior there didn&#39;t want<br/>
his sword (he was the only guild person there who could use it), so a lvl 20<br/>
warrior in our guild (who happened to be online at the time) is pretty darn<br/>
lucky (its a 2HS 23/40 3dex/str).<br/>
<br/>
None the less we got 3 of those nice daggers and about 8 weight reducing<br/>
packs (and lots of XP!  0 deaths!)<br/>
<br/>
I also got to show off my new drum as the main boss is a 42 necro, so I wove<br/>
guardian and purifying rythms and he couldn&#39;t get anything to stick on us.<br/>
(we made sure my group kept his attention as I am the only bard in the<br/>
guild)</div>
