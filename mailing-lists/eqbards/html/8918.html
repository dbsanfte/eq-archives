&lt;&lt;  Sure I see a lot of the names, but you never hear about<br/>
 them recruiting, or holding events, etc.  The Sisterhood was the only guild<br/>
 I&#39;ve ever seen to hold an event.  Maybe Tunare is just a bad server for such<br/>
 things. &lt;shrug&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I play on Tunare , and it is true there aren&#39;t many events on the server. But <br/>
I do get invited into guilds all the time. Just group with someone, ask them <br/>
how they like their guild. Just start a casual conversation with them while <br/>
grouping. If you are a good bard , and they like how you do things. you&#39;ll <br/>
get invited . Usually at the end of the night i&#39;ll get a tell from someone i <br/>
don&#39;t even know ( the leader of the guild ) asking me to join. Many of the <br/>
guilds are well established so they don&#39;t actively go out and recruit , but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t take more members. and besides every guild needs <br/>
as many bards as they can get ) BtW feel free to  look me up on Tunare if you <br/>
ever need help or anything.<br/>
