<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088789161">There is also a warp point in Permafrost.  If you are fighting at the zone <br/>
line and a gob makes it to the end of the hall it will warp up the ladder to <br/>
around the back of the first room there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Found one in Steamfont too, fighting pumas and rats with my druid, on the<br/>
&gt;left of the mills (when coming from Ak&#39;Anon, Mino caves straight). When<br/>
&gt;things started running or were feared they used to warp close to the mills.<br/>
&gt;Once I found it I just ran to the warp point and continue the fight over<br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rathe mountains is and always has been bad for warpers, there&#39;s a spot<br/>
&gt; &gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we hunt hg&#39;s at and if the monsters get to a certain little bump in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrain, get ready for trains of em to come back at ya... anything <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over this pathing location will warp away and take a long time to come<br/>
&gt; &gt;back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is close to the hill giant hill with the 2 guards on the top. <br/>
&gt;Hg&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; giant skels, lizards, cycs, basilisks, anything that goes here warps.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i dont have the loc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oasis has a very bad warp spot as well, right by the water just south of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;pillar one&quot;.  You only<br/>
&gt; &gt;notice it with things that are running away, like orc warriors or things<br/>
&gt; &gt;that have been feared.<br/>
