*sigh* Druids didn&#39;t used to have this rep...<br/>
[snip]<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to imply that *all* druids fell into the &quot;agressively stupid&quot;<br/>
category...In fact, a well played druid is extremely powerful...one of the most<br/>
powerful, versatile classes in the game.  I have grouped with skilled druids<br/>
quite often.<br/>
<br/>
But, it is that versatility that gets the bad (or uneducated, agressively<br/>
stupid...etc) *player* in trouble.  Just because a Druid has nukes, does not<br/>
make him a nuker.  Just because they have TPorts, does not make them a taxi. <br/>
But, a druid should be able to recognize just from group makeup what role<br/>
he/she is supposed to fill.  similar to bards in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
basically, noone ever says &quot;let&#39;s add that [shaman, druid, bard, cleric,<br/>
enchanter, ranger] to our group because we need a nuker.&quot;  None of those<br/>
classes are &quot;nukers&quot; but they all have DD spells/songs.  (same with necros,<br/>
mages)  Wizards are the only class in the game that you want &quot;for their<br/>
nukes&quot;...every other class has abilities that are a more efficient use of<br/>
*their* time, mana etc.<br/>
<br/>
just to make sure that i sound totally like a broken record, i would take any<br/>
class played by a good player over a more appropriate class with a bad, or even<br/>
just an unfamiliar [to me] player.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
