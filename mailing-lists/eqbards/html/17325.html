<b>Subject:</b> Haste tests... Swirlspine Belt? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098376483">I am curious as to how the Swirlspine Belt figures into all this.<br/>
I have heard rumors that it is both faster than, the same, and slower <br/>
than the FBSS.  Anyone have one they could try out?  If it is indeed <br/>
the same haste %, then by far it is better than the FBSS.<br/>
<br/>
This is interesting, I have a monk friend who has some Cape off of <br/>
Innoruuk that gives what he says is 30% haste, he might be interested <br/>
to know that my lil&#39; old Verses of Celerity might indeed give him <br/>
maximum haste.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder how monk attacks like Dragon Punch and Flying Kick, and also <br/>
Backstab figure into the equation.<br/>
