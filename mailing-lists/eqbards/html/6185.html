<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483002954">a hint... do like the rest of the people, run to zone.  Her alone is a nasty<br/>
one, and her charm is very powerfull, it kept a magician charmed for a very<br/>
long time when i got my drum, and my buddies dispelled the guy about 8 times<br/>
without success. your party might not be strong enough to kill her but then<br/>
again, it might be, whatever happens it will be ugly, good luck.<br/>

&gt; Well after a binge of pursuing crafted armour for our warrior, she decided<br/>
&gt; we should go after a mistmoore drum for myself and another bard. To bring<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the party we have:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Druid 29<br/>
&gt; Warrior 28<br/>
&gt; Thief 28 (I think)<br/>
&gt; Cleric 26<br/>
&gt; Wizard 26<br/>
&gt; Bard 26<br/>
&gt; Bard 24 (me :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And maybe a few well wishers, possibly high level, just for fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our general strategy so far:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Camp at graveyard waiting for trains coming from the secret door (I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been there this is all blind talk based on suggestions) when the train<br/>
&gt; happens look for the named gypsie with the pet. I will be singing<br/>
&gt; guardian/elemeal at a minimum, as well as other magic resist buffs. Nuke<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; gypsy, loot and zone.<br/>
&gt; My question for folks who have done it is, in your opinion, do we stand a<br/>
&gt; chance at ALL? Hints, suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; errand boy run faster.<br/>
