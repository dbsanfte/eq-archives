&gt; I agree with the other comment, you should probably be<br/>
&gt; meditating while testing this.  Also, immediately after the<br/>
&gt; test you should cast a spell that takes a known amount of mana<br/>
&gt; in bubbles, to see if there is any phantom mana effect that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; making it appear as if you have more mana than you do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would suggest NOT meditating for these tests, unless there is the possibility that jig only<br/>
affects mana regen while meditating.  Meditation adds a large random element to mana<br/>
regeneration.  As I understand it, when you meditate, every tick there&#39;s a chance that meditation<br/>
will make your mana regeneration higher than just sitting.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I have heard from two different Verant employees (both of them game designers, not<br/>
just GMs), though neither of them were GZ himself (who is the only person who knows<br/>
definatively), that the jig has no effect on mana regeneration, so my mind is already made up.<br/>
