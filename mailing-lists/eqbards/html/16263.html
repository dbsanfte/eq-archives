Back in my early 20&#39;s I met a cleric in Mistmoore who told the group he<br/>
planned to specialize in evocation and had chosen a cleric because<br/>
Wizards couldn&#39;t wear enough armor. I think he made it to the mid 30&#39;s<br/>
before his reputation as the cleric who didn&#39;t heal kept him from<br/>
getting groups anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
At least for the first few months of a server&#39;s life, it&#39;s a very small<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
He probably restarted as a druid. <br/>
