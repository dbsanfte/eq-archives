<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278839869">Swift Like the Wind costs a LOT of mana, and doesn&#39;t last as long as<br/>
the lower level speed up buff. Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>
beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>
in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>
<br/>
Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>
I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>
rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>
rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>
<br/>
Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>
use of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Swift Like The Wind<br/>
&gt;---------------------<br/>
&gt;Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>
&gt;Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of times you<br/>
&gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>
&gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>
&gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>
&gt;about breaking<br/>
&gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>
&gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>
&gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway. The<br/>
&gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>
&gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>
&gt;----------------------<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly matters<br/>
&gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>
&gt;speed buffs<br/>
&gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>
&gt;She says she does not want me to die that quickly.  But then again Innoruuk<br/>
&gt;killed her and not me ;p<br/>
