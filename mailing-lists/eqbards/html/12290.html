<div id="ygrps-yiv-532197278">Upon making 30th level I quickly maxxed out all my bard skills except for<br/>
brass.  Yesterday I got four straight missed notes when trying to start up<br/>
selos.  I had just logged into the game, wasn&#39;t in combat, and had no lag<br/>
problems.  If there is a base chance of 5% for missing a note, the chances<br/>
of me failing to start selos on four straight attempts was 0.00000625 (5% x<br/>
5% x 5% x 5%).  I think the random number generator was definately not<br/>
acting very random on this occasion.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; On a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>
&gt; may be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>
&gt; (both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>
&gt; number generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>
&gt; write code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>
&gt; of the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>
&gt; original IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>
&gt; eliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>
&gt; and y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>
&gt; plots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>
