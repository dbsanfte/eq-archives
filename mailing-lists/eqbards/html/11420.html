 </span></blockquote>  My frustration with attempting to level Harmonic has created the<br/>
  need for me to play around with my now L15 druid.  They break is<br/>
  most welcome, as opposed to being put on a list for the king room<br/>
  in SolB that is 14 people long.  I figure if I get on the list<br/>
  around 5pm, I am due up around 11pm, and I go to bed at midnight.<br/>
  Until then, most greater kobolds don&#39;t give any exp, and there<br/>
  are not many other outlets for exp at L46 (almost L47). <br/>
 <br/>
  I am no magician/druid/etc who, at L46, can solo ogre/troll guards.<br/>
  So, I either end up begging a few people to camp Oggok... which is<br/>
  extremely boring, or I sit around and accumulate /played time by<br/>
  fishing or baking.  (After 3 days of straight fishing, that tends<br/>
  to tire me as well)<br/>
<br/>
  Too many people, too few areas, Verant&#39;s big mistake.  It seems<br/>
  I&#39;m paying for it, however.  Anyway...<br/>
 <br/>
  I&#39;m playing my druid, and watching other classes (including<br/>
  bards) do their thing.  L15-L20 people.  Not completely bright<br/>
  chaps, but neither was I at that level.  So I sit back quietly,<br/>
  even going along with half-cooked ideas just to see what <br/>
  happens.  (Fighting harriers and coursers comes to mind in<br/>
  South Karana).  Sometimes I wonder what goes on in these <br/>
  peoples&#39; heads.  But I have seen most everything in the game,<br/>
  and I really have nothing to lose.  A party of four L15-L19s<br/>
  can in fact beat up an aviak harrier, despite what I thought.<br/>
  It could have been the calm factor I interjected into the<br/>
  group.  Or the resourcefulness I provided.  Never once, did<br/>
  I take a leadership role, nor did I give out information that<br/>
  would indicate playing another character who was 30 levels<br/>
  higher than these guys.<br/>
<br/>
  I must say that I never saw steel armor and weapons like<br/>
  these guys had at my level, but then again these guys seemed<br/>
  a lot smarter than I was too at the same level.  Perhaps,<br/>
  it was a really good group (oh how often do you find those).<br/>
  Or maybe these guys were just with it, on the ball.  But<br/>
  I had a better time playing with these not-so-experienced<br/>
  L15s than I have with any L45+ people in a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
  I miss grouping for effectiveness and tactics.  Nowadays,<br/>
  there&#39;s really no skill checking for my bard in his parties.<br/>
  Basically, nothing really goes wrong.  You just kill kill kill.<br/>
  Jump on the exp train and steam off until 50.  I don&#39;t ever<br/>
  question whether I can take X mob, or what song should I play.<br/>
  It&#39;s just the same button mashing over and over.  If you see<br/>
  3 LDCs, you just zone, no questions asked.  Definitely not<br/>
  the harrier who was almost 10 levels higher than me, who  <br/>
  after slaying gave me the warm feeling inside I used to get<br/>
  when an accomplishment was made.  No, higher level life is<br/>
  either really easy (boring) -or- really hard (frustrating).<br/>
<br/>
  I may reach 50 someday, I&#39;m so burned out with Harmonic again.<br/>
