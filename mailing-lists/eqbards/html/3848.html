When Dvinn finally conned Green to me, I thought, &quot;Heh heh, payback, inkie!&quot;<br/>
and went in the tower and waited for him, tapping my sword in my hand.<br/>
<br/>
He spawns. I con to make sure &quot;green&quot; just before he leaps upon me... and<br/>
proceeds to thoroughly and quickly, and neatly, destroy me. Instead of<br/>
taking 4 seconds to die to him when I was lower level, instead, it took<br/>
about 15 seconds (smile).<br/>
<br/>
The /con system is either broken, or intentionally left to mislead you. I<br/>
believe Verant intends you to &quot;con&quot; critters by actually fighting them,<br/>
rather than relying upon a computer to tell you the exact level your<br/>
opponent may be. Lately, the only reason I con something is to see if I will<br/>
get experience or not. Otherwise, to me, Conning is a complete and utter<br/>
waste of time.<br/>
