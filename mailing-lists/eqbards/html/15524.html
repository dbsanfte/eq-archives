<div id="ygrps-yiv-547833428">Get more RAM. :)  I don&#39;t get ANY disk thrashing when zoning.  It accesses<br/>
the HD for 1 or 2 seconds a couple of times, but sure doesn&#39;t thrash.  I<br/>
have 256Megs.  Odd that you&#39;d get D3D freezing with SCSI.. since SCSI puts<br/>
even less of a burden on the CPU than IDE does.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well, like I said, there&#39;s the annoying thing about Direct3D<br/>
&gt; freezing when there&#39;s heavy disk activity, causing the mouse<br/>
&gt; to go into accelerated mode.  I cannot begin to count the<br/>
&gt; number of times I&#39;ve zoned, started running and turned, the<br/>
&gt; disk (SCSI) grinds to load data, and instead of turning 90<br/>
&gt; degrees I get whipped 180 and hit the zone again.  I switch<br/>
&gt; back to Glide every now and then when I get frustrated with<br/>
&gt; this problem, but the framerate hit I take always makes me<br/>
&gt; switch back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll probably just end up buying a TNT2 or a GeForce. </span></blockquote></div>
