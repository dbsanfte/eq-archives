<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-392143116">Hiya,<br/>
Dont know if this is of any interest, but its bardic related.<br/>
Inspirered by the thread about running back to your corpse I decided to time my<br/>
run From Qeynos gates to West freeport through Highpass hold (Invisio on when I<br/>
passed through there).<br/>
<br/>
My stats: Woodelf bard, Level 22, Hand drum.<br/>
The time: 31min.<br/>
<br/>
While I was at it I also timed how long time it took me to zone (From &quot;loading<br/>
please wait&quot; until I could move on the other side): 40-60 secs(Dont have the<br/>
exact times here, but never above 60secs, that much I remember)<br/>
<br/>
My pc&#39;s stats:<br/>
P166MMX running 188/75MHz<br/>
Flash3D voodoo I card.<br/>
Win98<br/>
96MB Ram, BTW started with 64 in beta, My advice? 96MB is a minimum!<br/>
Connection: ISDN 64Kbit/s<br/>
<br/>
Musiker Silverdrum, Bertox.</div>
