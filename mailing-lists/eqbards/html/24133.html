Subject: [eqbards] UseFUL songs...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of listing ways in which songs are useless, let&#39;s talk about how to <br/>
use different songs.  I haven&#39;t played a bard in a long time, and there&#39;s a <br/>
whole lotta new songs out there - so I&#39;d like to know which songs will be <br/>
useful in which ways and combinations.<br/>
So.... as a starter,<br/>
<br/>
1st Level - Chant of Battle:<br/>
The first (and for a while, most useful), it&#39;s sung in combat - but since <br/>
it&#39;s not harmful, it should be sung at all times during a young bard&#39;s <br/>
early life until they&#39;ve maxed out their singing skills.  It enhances <br/>
combat abilities for the Bard and everyone in their group, and can be <br/>
successfully twisted / stacked / harmonized with most other below-tenth <br/>
songs.  It becomes outdated with the tenth level song: &quot;Anthem de Arms&quot; <br/>
(can it still be stacked with that, though?)<br/>
