However:<br/>
I agree that secondary can and will hit for minimum of 1 but it&#39;s Maximum,<br/>
with the same dmg value on the weapon, will be the same as your primary.  I<br/>
used a 5/19 slash (BtC) and a 6/18 pierce (Saeiny&#39;s Dagger) to test.<br/>
<br/>
The saeiny&#39;s dagger, even though it&#39;s in my offhand, will hit for just as<br/>
much (and often slightly more) as the claw at max.  It&#39;s MINIMUM, as you<br/>
said, is still 1.  So, overall, the average dmg is lower but you still DO<br/>
get the bonus to your dmg from offhand weapon.  I haven&#39;t found it unusual<br/>
to hit for 5 20&#39;s in a row (FBSS and haste song is a wondrous thing) with a<br/>
5/19 and 6/18 weapon.  If we didn&#39;t get the bonus to the offhand I&#39;d never<br/>
pierce for more than 13.<br/>
<br/>
So, in essence, what people are REALLY saying is:  Your offhand does not get<br/>
the MINIMUM dmg bonus but it does get the MAXIMUM dmg bonus.  Which means<br/>
that it&#39;s, effectively, getting half (avg dmg) of the dmg bonus that the<br/>
primary hand does.<br/>

&gt; Either I misunderstood you here or you may be a bit<br/>
&gt; off.  The scaler level bonus is (level-25)/3 (Note:<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure about post 50 but this holds true up to<br/>
&gt; 50) for 1h weapons and is primary hand only (there is<br/>
&gt; a slightly different 2h damage scalar for 2h weapons).<br/>
&gt;  I.e. at level 50 every time you hit with your main<br/>
&gt; weapon you do an additional 8 points of damage.  The<br/>
&gt; easy way to test that this is primary hand only is to<br/>
&gt; DW two different types of weapons and log the results.<br/>
&gt;  Look for your minimum hits not your maximum as that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a more easily identifiable number.  Your minimum hit<br/>
&gt; with primary hand will be 1+bonus and your min with<br/>
&gt; secondary hand will be 1.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking of bunuses:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The strength and dex bonus are not applied to your<br/>
&gt; offhand.  HOWEVER the LEVEL based Damage bonus is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level based bonus seems to be (Bonus=(level-25))<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard level-20 but haven&#39;t seen results to back<br/>
&gt; that up yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Right now I can hit for up to 22dmg with my Bladed<br/>
&gt; Thulian Claws and have hit for 23 with my Saeiny&#39;s<br/>
&gt; claw (in my offhand).<br/>
