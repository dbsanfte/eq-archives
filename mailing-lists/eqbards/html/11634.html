<b>Subject:</b> NPCs selling lambent stones (was Lambent Stones on  E&#39;ci)5 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-369564928">Thats a great story Shada.  Bet you made a friend for life with that tip.  <br/>
<br/>
I would imagine that a lot of people have sold lambent stones to the gypsies<br/>
in NK.  Nice to know that if I&#39;m having trouble finding a giant hunting<br/>
party or someone selling a stone I can always try this option.  Hard part<br/>
then would be picking the right gypsy:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; it shows the older items.  my friend accidentally sold his mortificator<br/>
&gt; staff to an npc.  this is the only one we know of on our server, he got it<br/>
&gt; in a GM event.  i did not hear until about a week later, and he was still<br/>
&gt; upset about it.  i told him i heard if you go buy all of the items from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; list it will eventually pop up.  and it worked, he got the staff back, but<br/>
&gt; he had to buy a bunch of stuff for it to show up.  AND he even killed the<br/>
&gt; vendor after he sold it, but when he repopped he still had the staff<br/>
&gt; buried<br/>
&gt; beneath all the junk.<br/>
