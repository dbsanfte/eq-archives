It all depends on where you level.  One of my guildmates recently posted<br/>
on another forum something that I think applies.  I&#39;ll paraphrase and sum<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
Basically for every set of levels there is an &quot;easy&quot; place and a<br/>
&quot;difficult&quot; place to level.  Easy places are either outdoor zones, or<br/>
dungeons where everything is near the zone line.  Cazic and Solusek <br/>
B are &quot;easy places&quot;.  Najena, Upper Guk, and Lower Guk are not.<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
If I spend levels 35 to 50 in Solusek B, I can probably count the number<br/>
of times on one hand where gate has made a difference.  If I spend them in<br/>
Lower Guk, that would not be the case.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; question specializes in alteration their chance to get a gate off with<br/>
&gt; multiple mobs beating on them when things go bad is about nil. And<br/>
&gt; casters that gate out at the first sign of trouble don&#39;t get invited<br/>
&gt; back into groups very often.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Actually, mana cost and fizzle percentage are the only 2 things<br/>
I&#39;ve heard confirmed as to what specializations affect, but that&#39;s totally<br/>
besides the point here.  I&#39;m a cleric specializing in Alteration.  I<br/>
channel through my evocation spells still close to 90% of the time<br/>
(although retribution is a bit lower since it&#39;s a lvl 49 spell).  Now,<br/>
granted, my channeling has now capped at 240, but I&#39;ve been greater than<br/>
50% since around lvl 30 or so, and when I was level 30, spec&#39;s haven&#39;t<br/>
even been implemented yet.  So no, it&#39;s not gauranteed that you&#39;ll get<br/>
your gate off, but channeling through a lvl 5 spell at level 30 is simple,<br/>
and it&#39;s CERTAINLY not &quot;nil&quot; as you suggest.<br/>
