<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073979806">Methinks you got a little lucky - brownies hate EVERYONE - and they are<br/>
NASTY NASTY beasts.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters have to buy their new potion spells there - let me tell you,<br/>
that in itself was an adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Brownies can&#39;t see thru invis - the most reliable way to fetch a corpse<br/>
from the brownie camp is invisible.<br/>
<br/>
The guards and merchants inside (also rather ugly critters) seem to be<br/>
different factions - if one of them had seen you, might not have been so<br/>
lucky. Buying that enchanter spell was a two step process - had to<br/>
Benevolence the guards - then use minor illusion to go indifferent to the<br/>
merchant. Least it&#39;s not 3 zones deep into darkie territory like the<br/>
enchant metal spells in Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel too badly bout dying to them tho - I&#39;ve had to help lvl 50<br/>
friends get their corpses out of there.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Not very friendly, are they?<br/>
&gt;To make a long story short (because it&#39;s time to go home ;) as I was <br/>
&gt;running back and trying to decide to help this poor newbie who was nearly <br/>
&gt;in tears, afraid he was going to lose his corpse and stuff, as well as <br/>
&gt;getting my own stuff back, when I suddenly remembered something someone had <br/>
&gt;told me about the Charismatic Carrilon... and how it would make some <br/>
&gt;unfriendly people friendly.....<br/>
&gt;After comforting the bereaved young one, I travelled quickly to the site of <br/>
&gt;the Brownie Village, and snuck as close as I thought I could without <br/>
&gt;enraging any Brownies... Firing up my new song, I was rewarded with a glow <br/>
&gt;and the appropriate message, and when conning, sure enough, the Brownie <br/>
&gt;guards were indifferent.<br/>
&gt;I wasn&#39;t sure how long the effect lasted, so I flanicked and peed... er.. <br/>
&gt;panicked and fled with the contents of the little guy&#39;s corpse., while <br/>
&gt;dragging my own.  A few moments later, he was reunited with his stuff, and <br/>
&gt;shortly thereafter, I was as well.  What a deal ;)<br/>
