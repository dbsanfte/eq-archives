<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047604483">I know very few of you are on Bristlebane, but I wanted to tell a <br/>
story of someone who does not seem worthy of grouping with Bards.  I <br/>
was in a group by the green pool in cazic thule (where stone golem <br/>
spawns).  The group leader, a ranger by the name of silverwinde is <br/>
not someone I will ever group with again.  The puller pulled the <br/>
stone golem and three alligators, (dont know if on purpose or not) We <br/>
proceeded to hack away at stone golem while i mezzed the gators.  The <br/>
druid memmed evac &quot;just in case&quot; and we fought away.  The wizard died <br/>
rather early on, and since i was busy full time with pixie strike on <br/>
the three gators, I was not able to keep healing up also, (perhaps i <br/>
should be able to I dont know) I twisted it in on ocasion, but did <br/>
not keep it going full time.  The stone golem was under a bubble when <br/>
our druid called out oom, Silverwinde had taken significant dmg and <br/>
required several heals as the other ranger and warrior did not seem <br/>
to be able to taunt it off him.  He died shortly after druid called <br/>
oom. I was under two bubbles of health at that time and died seconds <br/>
after Silverwinde.  Up to this point I had no problem with <br/>
Silverwinde, we were all trying to make the best of a bad situation, <br/>
perhaps he should of stepped back or stopped swinging a second to let <br/>
the other ranger or the warrior take some damage, but who knows...  <br/>
All in all, everyone died, except the druid who used spirit of <br/>
cheatah and made the zone.<br/>
<br/>
We all proceed with CR.  The wiz casts invis on me (since Verant in <br/>
there infinate wisdom requires shari&#39;s sonorous clouding to have a <br/>
wind instrument present) and we proceed down to my body (We being <br/>
wiz, 2nd ranger and me) I have no clue where silverwinde is and the <br/>
warrior is getting a teleport back, so no longer in group.  Druid <br/>
(only survivor) apologized and had to log.  Wiz casts invis again <br/>
while i loot my body and then says afk. I wait by silverwindes body, <br/>
ask if he wants it drug to zone, ask if he wants me to sing invis <br/>
while he loots, etc... no he doesnt want me to drag, he will get it. <br/>
Thats ok by me. I am just getting ready to run up to courtyard and my <br/>
invis wears off so I fire up my song and away I go. Silverwinde shows <br/>
up about that time and asks me to turn off my song.  I said i would <br/>
if he would camo me. (MY BIG MISTAKE, I should of just disbanded). He <br/>
said ok, there were no gators nearby, so I dropped invis and he <br/>
immediately got hit, then I did.  Im running / swimming for the zone, <br/>
while they all beat on me and I died trying to find the place to swim <br/>
up. just too many gators all on me.  As Im dying, Silverwinde <br/>
says, &quot;I HATE BARD SONGS&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is why Im grumpy with silverwinde.  If i hadnt dropped invis at <br/>
his request, I would of been fine.  Then to top it off, he says its <br/>
my fault.  Yes, I did a foolish thing, but it was at the request of <br/>
the party leader, who presumable knew the area better than I. (it was <br/>
the first time I had fought down there) And he says &quot;I HATE BARD <br/>
SONGS&quot;. I was so mad, I just said Bye and logged out.  Now I off for <br/>
second corpse retrieval.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long tale of a personal problem, but I needed to vent <br/>
to someone, and I figured you would all understand.<br/>
