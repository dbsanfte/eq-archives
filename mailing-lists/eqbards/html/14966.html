<div id="ygrps-yiv-393375922">I have several customers that I would like to cast See Invoice on.  Despite<br/>
repeated mailings they still claim that they &quot;never got them&quot;.  I have come<br/>
to suspect that the Invoices have somehow become invisible in transit and<br/>
are actually in their in boxes.  Can you tell me where this song/spell is<br/>
found?  It sounds like Ak&#39;Anon or Erudin libraries perhaps?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A possible theory I&#39;ve heard so far (also mentioned by<br/>
&gt; someone here) is that there are mobs that cast see invoice<br/>
&gt; on others.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; While the cast see invoice theory may be the answer - I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; attacked so many times trying to get to and from the<br/>
&gt; graveyard/cave area - I believe that Verant added See Invoice<br/>
&gt; to some of those mobs...<br/>
