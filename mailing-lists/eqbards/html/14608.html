method, hate has always been breakable.  The main issue here is you&#39;ll<br/>
clear your way to a Spite Golem whose pet is stuck halfway across the<br/>
zone, who you can&#39;t pull because invariably no matter which pull method<br/>
you use 10 other things agro&#39;d by the pet come with the golem.<br/>
	Sure, CR is simple, and hate was broken, but you can&#39;t pull any<br/>
further, so why even bother?  Do I want to spend 3 hours trying to unstick<br/>
a bugged pet, thereby adding 3 hours to the time it takes to clear a<br/>
plane?  No thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Looking around Azarack island, it seems that the spawns are spaced<br/>
far enough apart to combat drop in.  We&#39;ll see, when my guild gets over<br/>
their recent apathy for doing anything big we&#39;ll probably be back in sky.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Your guild is geared for doing dragons, even after the upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	It&#39;s just that our guild has 8 clerics.  Really, that&#39;s the only<br/>
important thing.  Any guild with 7 or 8 level 50 clerics can gather up a<br/>
dragon party pretty easily.  You have 6 melee classes who are more or less<br/>
interchangable, so finding them is not that big an issue.<br/>
	One of the major failings I&#39;ve seen with non-LoD dragon raids is<br/>
that the invite have generally been to people &quot;45+&quot;.  Honestly, that&#39;s not<br/>
good enough.  The difference between 24 level 45+ people and 24 level 50<br/>
people is enormous.  If someone wants to organize a dragon raid, the<br/>
people who go should be restricted to 49+, and the number of people kept<br/>
under 30.  Make those * hard * caps, and resist the urge to invite<br/>
additional friends to come.  Obviously, there are exceptions to this.<br/>
Classes that are not expected to melee or nuke can be lower (read: clerics<br/>
and bards, occasionally druids and shaman).  But if you&#39;re a melee class<br/>
or a pure caster, the answer should be 49+ only.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Well, currently, that&#39;s true to some extent, mostly because the<br/>
guilds that do have the right mix of people don&#39;t have those people all at<br/>
level 50.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I can imagine the frustration behind that.  If you all are going<br/>
&gt;   to play with Vox again, I&#39;m up for assisting thus freeing up one<br/>
&gt;   of your secondary bards to class shift.  There&#39;s not much else to<br/>
&gt;   to do anymore, anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I don&#39;t take my bard on dragon raids anymore.  In fact, I&#39;ve<br/>
dropped almost all my resist equipment for wis equipment.  Now I take<br/>
signifigantly more damage than the rest of my party from the AE, but I<br/>
make up for it because unlike my groupmates, I&#39;m * always * in range of my<br/>
own AE heal spell, which balances that out.  The melee classes go all<br/>
resists, the casters should go all wis.  I get an extra AE heal out of my<br/>
wis equipment, that&#39;s 500hp for everyone in my group.<br/>
<br/>
	We&#39;ve done Vox twice recently with 1 bard.  I think our equipment<br/>
is getting to the point where bards are more of a bonus than a necessity.<br/>
When your entire guild has dragon/plane level haste equipment and<br/>
weapons, your effectiveness goes up by an incredible amount.  4 groups<br/>
with that level equipment is equivilent to 6 normal group&#39;s damage output.<br/>
So we have 6 groups worth of damage, but only 4 groups worth of lag.<br/>
