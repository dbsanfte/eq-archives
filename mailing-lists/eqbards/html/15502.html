<div id="ygrps-yiv-798029624">Hehe..  I was hording that idea until I went to Sky myself.  People had been<br/>
complaining about getting from island to island now that lev no longer<br/>
works.  It occurred to me that MMM might work, but I didn&#39; tell anyone since<br/>
I hadn&#39;t been yet.  As I assume you know, MMM always takes you to an equal<br/>
or lower elevation, never to a higher elevation than where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Well when you gate into sky you&#39;re put onto the first Fairy island which is<br/>
considerably lower than the rest of them.  However, as I understand it, the<br/>
second island is higher than the third, so MMM might work to move you from 2<br/>
to 3 without fighting your way there.  I do not know yet.  Also, there is no<br/>
way to insure that your group will come with you.  If the bard makes it to<br/>
island 3 with MMM, some members of your group are bound to be left behind.<br/>
So the logistics may make it impossible or very difficult at least.<br/>
<br/>
The bigger problem is that Verant is not screwing around in Sky.  That Plane<br/>
is designed to be fought in a specific order and they will nerf anything<br/>
that works around that.  If MMM became popular for moving around in Sky, I&#39;m<br/>
quite sure they would nerf MMM in Sky just as they did Levitation.<br/>
<br/>
Still 47th from spending so much time in Planes.  But hey, I actually came<br/>
out of a 12 hour Hate trip half a bubble UP in experience.  No Imbrued<br/>
dropped at all though and we didn&#39;t quite get to the Meastro.  :-/  I have<br/>
the BP but nothing else at this point.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m almost there... how many thousands of undead frogs have I<br/>
&gt; killed and yet<br/>
&gt; the live ones still hold that one little GB incident, more of a<br/>
&gt; misunderstanding really, against me! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow just because I&#39;m curious has anyone tried MMM in Air to<br/>
&gt; see where it<br/>
&gt; puts you?  I understand if you fall off an island you end up in the water<br/>
&gt; off E FP, but perhaps MMM might reveal a hidden area or maybe let you do<br/>
&gt; some out of sequence island hopping.  I&#39;ll test this the first chance I<br/>
&gt; get - right after I bank all my gear. =)<br/>
