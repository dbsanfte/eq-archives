&gt;     I also have a Barbarian Warrior on Tarew Marr, and have made it a <br/>
&gt;point<br/>
&gt;to keep his alcohol tolerance maxxed. I usually drink short beer, and have<br/>
&gt;found even with his 60 int, I raised a point in alcohol tolerance every <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;I drank one. My Barb has 130str and 110sta, and after getting completely<br/>
&gt;wasted, they both go up 20 points (my alcohol tolerance is now 120). I make<br/>
&gt;it a point to carry a backpack full of beer and down a few every time I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;a duel or am fighting a high level monster. It&#39;s like having temporary<br/>
&gt;Berserk (what happens when Warriors get low on HP). Berserk basically<br/>
&gt;increases your hit%, damage, and hit speed. Anything that does that works<br/>
&gt;for me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     In a Bards case, alcohol tolerance, IMHO should actually INCREASE the<br/>
&gt;effects of our songs. For instance, when I was playing in a band I played<br/>
&gt;100 times better when I was completely hammered. In the sense Verant is<br/>
&gt;using it, being drunk seems to enhance a characters specialty (ie. Warriors<br/>
&gt;fight better and main stats increase), so why shouldn&#39;t Bards become more<br/>
&gt;rambunctious and charismatic?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dunno, I guess some people take it differently. When I&#39;m hammered I look <br/>
at my guitar and try to play and I feel as if i&#39;ve never played before in my <br/>
life. I have a hard time doing anything other than basic chords.<br/>
