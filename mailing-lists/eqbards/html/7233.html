&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;From these results it is easy to see that the Flowing Black Silk Sash and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Anthem de Arms do indeed Stack thier Speed increases.  In Fact, when<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Comined<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;together their enhancements are far Better than the sum of thier parts.  In<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;some way when comBined they totally rule.  Using Both the Sash and Singing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Anthem De Arms I took a 21/7  weapon down to a 14/7 one, and a 24/8 down to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;15/8.  These are phenomenal stats.  Get a Sash when you can.  They are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;great<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;stuff.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;From EQ Lizer: <br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;This is one of the most sought after items in the game for melee classes.<br/>
&gt;&gt; It is worn in your belt slot. It increases your attack speed by roughly 25%<br/>
&gt;&gt;  and can be found in Lower Guk.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another note on the sash, while the test posted showed it with a L27<br/>
&gt;bard, you can forget getting one until you can take a tough group of<br/>
&gt;L45+ players into lower guk, unless your guild is very pro-twinking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its a rare drop off a rare mob, the Frenzied frogluk. Depending on the<br/>
spawn, you only need a full lvl 40 group to take the room, and or an<br/>
intrepid lvl 50 necromancer (yes, a lvl 50 necro can solo that room with a<br/>
bit of luck using charm). However, if you see 2 bloodthirsties and 1<br/>
frenzied spawn in the room... well you better hope a lull doesnt fail :).<br/>
Of course i have seen 1 wan, 1 dar, and some pansy caster frogluk spawn<br/>
there before, in which case seperate out the spawn as much as possible and<br/>
you wont have much of a problem.<br/>
	But thats not what i wanted to post, i wanted to post that this test,<br/>
while i had fun reading about it, doesnt really mean anything. You would<br/>
have to repeat this test at least 3 times for each equipment set to even<br/>
start to see meaningful results. And the biggest flaw is the fact that the<br/>
sand beetle he tested it on varies in level, which would have another<br/>
impact on the numbers. Need to find an npc that spawns at the same lvl<br/>
everytime to perform a test like this. <br/>
<br/>
Course i have never even taken a statistics class so i could be way off on<br/>
this :)</div>
