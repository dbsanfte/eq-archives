 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  Short answer:  No.<br/>
<br/>
Long answer:  My guild and I tried this over the weekend.  We<br/>
caused probably one of the biggest trains in the history of<br/>
Mistmoore.  From what I could tell, the music room, negotiator<br/>
room, piano/window room (and stuff outside), and all the mobs<br/>
in the little nooks and crannies in between came pouring out.<br/>
<br/>
The plateu in front of the castle is easy to break (go in<br/>
invis to the far side, drop invis, and lull everything you<br/>
see, then pull).  The mobs just inside the gate (there are 2-4<br/>
of them) are easy as well, as are the two gargoyles in the<br/>
grand hall/lobby.  You got this far:<br/>
<br/>

&gt; managed to fight their way into the lobby (with<br/>
&gt; the stairs going to second floor, etc.) but then<br/>
&gt; we couldn&#39;t figure out how to reasonably go much<br/>
&gt; further due to large clusters of mobs at such odd<br/>
&gt; angles that lament wasn&#39;t really doable, etc.<br/>
&gt; Plus the fact that everyone was scared out of<br/>
&gt; their minds because of the stories of bad pathing,<br/>
&gt; trains, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Be glad you didn&#39;t try it.  I got to this point, tried<br/>
to come up with a way to lament the mobs but couldn&#39;t.  So I<br/>
had a ranger try casting harmony.  That&#39;s when we started that<br/>
train.<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t that lament or harmony don&#39;t work - they<br/>
do.  The problem is that the pathing is so screwed up that the<br/>
mobs take circuitous routes.  You pull the mob in front of the<br/>
music room, and instead of following you, it will circle<br/>
around the entire music room, out the back door, through the<br/>
negotiator room, then through the lobby, incidently pulling<br/>
everything it meets along the way.  There *might* be a way to<br/>
pull it semi-safely (I suspect you can pull the negotiator<br/>
room by itself), but I&#39;m not going to risk getting other<br/>
innocents killed in trains figuring out how.<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to safely get to the music room.  By<br/>
far the easiest is to have a high level person pull.  We had a<br/>
L48 person do it, but I hear a L47 can do it as well.  Most of<br/>
the stuff won&#39;t aggro on a person this high, so he can pull,<br/>
the mob can go through its convoluted pathing, and it won&#39;t<br/>
trigger any extras.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a high level person, someone in wolf form<br/>
who hasn&#39;t played much in Mistmoore can pull just a few at a<br/>
time (I think agro radius is linked to faction).<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have any of these, you have two options I know<br/>
of.  First is to invis your party and go back into the<br/>
kitchen.  Kill the three mobs there, clear the hallway, then<br/>
the maid and bulter rooms.  Then comes the hard part - using<br/>
invis to move around, lull the gargoyles in front of the<br/>
negotiator room.  Once they&#39;re lulled, you can position<br/>
yourself to lull stuff inside the negotiator room (the agro<br/>
radius extends beyond the door so don&#39;t get too close).  If<br/>
you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll get 1-3 mobs at a time.  If you&#39;re not so<br/>
lucky, you&#39;ll get the entire negotiator room, the three mobs<br/>
in the alcove beyond it, and a couple gargs (which is the<br/>
monster pull I described in my other post).  Once the<br/>
negotiator room is clear, you can start to crack the music<br/>
room.  I haven&#39;t gotten this far, so I can&#39;t help you beyond<br/>
this point.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The other option is go in the back way, through the jail.  <br/>
Clear up to just before the pool room.  If Xicotl is not up,<br/>
you can clear the pool room, then pull the room down the<br/>
stairs.  If Xicotl is up, you&#39;re probably best off invising<br/>
everyone and just going down the stairs to the next room and<br/>
clearing there.  After that is the piano room - make sure you<br/>
fight away from the windows or you&#39;ll pull the entire outside<br/>
as well.  Clear the outside if you want to be safe.  Then the<br/>
alcove just before the music room.  After this I&#39;m not sure,<br/>
but I&#39;ve seen other groups pull the music room from here so it<br/>
must be possible.<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory on another way to pull.  I was invis and had<br/>
SoW on, and started what should&#39;ve been a train.  All I got<br/>
was three mobs.  I think what happened is that after I<br/>
triggered the first mob and it started its screwed up pathing,<br/>
my invis kicked in making me indifferent to everything else.  <br/>
So the castle didn&#39;t get aggroed when the three mobs passed by<br/>
them (kinda like how green mobs won&#39;t trigger if you let a<br/>
runner get away).  I haven&#39;t really tested if this is what is<br/>
really happening, so use it at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
All this becomes much easier of course if another group has<br/>
partially cleared the inside.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it, pretty much all I&#39;ve learned about<br/>
the castle in Mistmoore.<br/>
