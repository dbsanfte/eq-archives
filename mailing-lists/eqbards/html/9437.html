<div id="ygrps-yiv-980043900">I was wondering is there a way for me to get the gypsy Lute and the Usher<br/>
gloves with a lvl 50 paladin and a lvl 50 wizard with Ice Comet.  I am lvl<br/>
39 now.  None of us know MM that well.  We have been at MM for the past 2<br/>
weeks and we got no success at all.  We would always get train on.  I was<br/>
wondering if there is a way or some hints as to how to get the 2 pieces of<br/>
the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Thnx,<br/>
