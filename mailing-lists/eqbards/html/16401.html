<div id="ygrps-yiv-161968324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This one choice of how to fix a problem has caused innumerable others.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure how it could be fixed now, or if even it could without a lot of<br/>

&gt; how bad it would really be if they took a stab at it.  Reduced the hp&#39;s of<br/>
&gt; all the mobs to the original pre buffed numbers and fixed the dual wield<br/>
&gt; problem.  It might appear ugly at first, but I think it would put the game<br/>
&gt; back onto the track they think it is on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Very well stated.  I found myself in agreement on all your points.<br/>
  You just knocked down that nail with a Butcherblock Hammer.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant is too protective of their game.  If somehow I figured<br/>
  out that a certain combination of skills and spells and classes<br/>
  made a dragon or a god 50% easier to conquer - the next patch<br/>
  would have a &#39;fix&#39; for it.  Verant doesn&#39;t want you to succeed<br/>
  from strategy, Abashi has made that clear.  They want you to<br/>
  throw players and deaths at something to accomplish your goal.<br/>
<br/>
  Verant in that way is like a 12 yr old GM who always wants his<br/>
  way.  If you overcome his trap he set for you, he throws a tantrum<br/>
  and you all of a sudden randomly encounter a mob who kills you<br/>
  in a few rounds.  I&#39;ve played with GMs like this.  I&#39;ve GM&#39;d games<br/>
  myself and that temptation is there.  Verant feels like players<br/>
  are getting the better of them, and they need to separate this<br/>
  ownership and concentrate on making better more challenging areas.<br/>
  I&#39;m kinda glad the private npc hp variable is a signed 2 byte <br/>
  integer.  Serves them right:  No monster can have more than 32768<br/>
  hit points.  They won&#39;t be pulling this &#39;just up the hp&#39; bullsh*t<br/>
  anymore.  Then again, they have other ridiculous options.  Like<br/>
  melee in the thousands, deathtouch(sm), and other countless 12 yr<br/>
  GM tactics.  If they would only design their game around the<br/>
  mechanical foundation they put in place, they&#39;d be ok.  Instead<br/>
  what does DEX really do?  What does AGI really do?  My CHA doesn&#39;t<br/>
  amount to much as long as it&#39;s over 100.  It makes me think they<br/>
  wanted to base their system around a 100 point scale for stats.<br/>
  You get diminishing return after 100, but you are heavily penalized<br/>
  for having stats 75 or below.  I am doing twice as good with STR,<br/>
  AC, and HP items.<br/>
<br/>
  If stats clearly made a difference...  If they would solve problems<br/>
  instead of patching them with quick repairs... I think we&#39;d be <br/>
  looking at an entire different (and fun) game.  As a player in any<br/>
  RPG, the hooks are character advancement and items/accomplishments.<br/>
  Verant is intent on making these two aspects of their game harder and<br/>
  harder to the point where you don&#39;t feel rewarded for the effort.  Sure<br/>
  the day I got my picollo and the day I got boots and helm from hate were<br/>
  great, but that&#39;s not the norm.  That&#39;s the RNG working for a change.<br/>
  <br/>
  Man this post is long... /yawn ;-)  I played a game last night called<br/>
  Airport, Inc.  Sounded fun, looked cool, Airport Simulation, kinda<br/>
  neat.  Fired it up, had a blast building my airport and laying it<br/>
  all out.  But no matter what I did I couldn&#39;t make enough money to<br/>
  keep the place running.  The tutorial with the game even couldn&#39;t<br/>
  do it, and that&#39;s horrible when your demo can&#39;t even succeed.  I <br/>
  tried different things, and in the end I was spinning my wheels.<br/>
  Then I played Age of Wonders, (ala Warlords).  Another awesome<br/>
  game on the front, but as I advanced through one of their campaigns<br/>
  I noticed that I could only upkeep 3 or 4 units at each castle <br/>
  until I started losing money.  I am the type of person who plays<br/>
  defensive on all cases, and I like strong guarded towns/castles,<br/>
  but this limitation forced me to give up the game after an hour<br/>
  of playing it.  I just have really high expectation from games I<br/>
  play.  If they don&#39;t allow advancement and the feeling of <br/>
  accomplishment, I tend to give them up quickly.  Everquest sways<br/>
  back and forth across that line.  Thus so does my playtime these<br/>
  days.<br/>
