<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907785963">South Karana might be good for you.  Rooks - con? Harriers & Avos with your<br/>
druid pal.  Herman the hermit with either healer. Also High Keep pickclaws.<br/>
If you and the shaman can camp the ramp, you should be able to do well<br/>
without making any of the rooms too mad.  Or maybe the Lookout Room if you<br/>
can get it.  Also, that guy in the Highkeep jail - Osarian? Good xp til<br/>
30ish?  Also, your 35 sha should be able to pull Runnyeye gobs to the zone<br/>
where you can fite them.  If your shaman can pull single shadow men and you<br/>
can damage them that might be an option too.  Going to need a lot of healing<br/>
and MR buffing.<br/>
<br/>
Powerleveling is still lots and lots of killing - dont expect that you will<br/>
get like a level in an hour or 2.  Getting a bubble of XP per hour is what I<br/>
would consider really good.<br/>

&gt; The following may not be ethical to some of you but oh well.. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been lacking in time lately to play my bard.. he is level 23. I<br/>
have some high level friends<br/>
&gt; who have offered to power me up some. They are all late 20&#39;s to mid 30&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question is what to kill and where? Any suggestions? As in what gives<br/>
great XP that with the help of<br/>
&gt; a level 29 Druid or level 35 Shaman can I kill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
