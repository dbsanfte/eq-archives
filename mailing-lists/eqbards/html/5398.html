<div id="ygrps-yiv-420225560">I&#39;m glad your experience in Mistmoore has been better than mine.  I&#39;ve gone<br/>
from 21 to 22, back to 21, gained 22, and now back to 21st level again.<br/>
These deaths have been primarily due to one or two jerks purposely causing<br/>
massive trains.  The most recent time my group was camping in the graveyard.<br/>
We had a party of 5 people all in their low 20s.  We were doing OK with what<br/>
we had.  A 30th level necromancer asked to join us.  Our group leader told<br/>
him no because of his level.  Next thing we know the necro is leading a<br/>
train of ancilles and gargoyles into the graveyard.  As soon as he got to<br/>
the graveyard, he gated out.  They promptly killed me and one other person.<br/>
The other three were able to gate out.      <br/>
<br/>
Next time I log on I&#39;m going back to Unrest.  At my level, almost everything<br/>
in Mistmoore except the familiars and sentrys were resisting my songs.  In<br/>
Unrest I think I will be a little more useful.  Will probably head back to<br/>
Mistmoore when I&#39;m around 25th level.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your original question, the posts I have read indicate the Lute of<br/>
the Gypsy Princess does not confer any bonuses to songs that use the String<br/>
skill.<br/>

&gt; 25<br/>
&gt; in no time.<br/>
