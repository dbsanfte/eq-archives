<div id="ygrps-yiv-228791868">Hi ,<br/>
<br/>
My Bard is a bit low level and as such has never  been<br/>
to Burning Woods - but both my wizard and Ranger visit<br/>
there quite often.<br/>
<br/>
I am part of a very big guild ( 150 plus) and our<br/>
guild channel is like the CNN of EQ . We know what<br/>
happens in virtually every zone of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
When any of us group with our bards ( 40plus ) in<br/>
burning woods we have an EXTREMELY hard time keeping<br/>
the mobs off him/her. Its like a flag pops up that<br/>
says Bard in the zone - get him/her.<br/>
<br/>
In fact it has become so  bad that the bard has to<br/>
camp after every aggro attack. That seems to help a<br/>
bit. We dont even bother to pull - the mobs just<br/>
charge at us. So now what happens is that the groups<br/>
rather prefer the enchanters - which really turns<br/>
everything into a nightmare for the bard.<br/>
<br/>
The same group without a bard - with enchanter- has<br/>
nowhere near the amount of aggro&#39;s to deal with. In<br/>
fact at a specific loc it is relatively safe and no<br/>
MOBS wander close - untill the bard joins. Then the<br/>
whole zone wants to visit the previously relatively<br/>
safe loc.<br/>
<br/>
Wow - we ramble on dont we - anyhow - back to my own<br/>
bard - experienced something similar in everfrost last<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I normally fight down by the south tower killing<br/>
Mammoths. Barb warriors love grouping with me cause I<br/>
can regen ( note not heal ) and it reduces their down<br/>
time dramatically .<br/>
<br/>
So I get to the south tower - Orc Shaman charges me -<br/>
literally running over other players to get at me. Not<br/>
a big problem - Selos up and Mistmoore Battledrum (<br/>
twink is such a nasty word) and off I go.<br/>
<br/>
I run all the way to the One Guard and sit there and<br/>
nothing happens so I go back. I get to the tower and<br/>
THREE shamans come charging for me. Okay now it gets<br/>
hairy but I survive and run back to 1 Guard and camp<br/>
trying to clear the hate list.<br/>
<br/>
So I get to the tower and all my friends ask me what<br/>
did I do to the shamans that they are so heavily aggro<br/>
onto me. They all can stand there relataively close to<br/>
the shaman and nothing will happen. As soon as I (<br/>
bard) get close all the shamans gun for me.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say- this is making my bardic experiences<br/>
turn into survival experiences. And therefore really<br/>
making my bard life a hard one.<br/>
<br/>
So what I am really advocating is - why should we be<br/>
on the TOP of every zone hate list ? My<br/>
ranger/wizard/enchanter and necro dont have these<br/>
problems and therefore level much faster than my bard.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I am having the Bardic Blues and really cant<br/>
figure out how some of you got past level 50 while<br/>
being the most wanted beings in Norrath.<br/>

Songer.<br/>
