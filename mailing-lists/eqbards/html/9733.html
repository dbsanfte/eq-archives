<div id="ygrps-yiv-992234944">Yes, it seems that Lament only lowers the agro radius of the mob, not<br/>
necessarily reducing it to zero.  I also try to lament the farther mobs and<br/>
pull the other so it doesn&#39;t run right thru the lamented ones, possibly<br/>
activating them.  This has been almost universally successful for me.<br/>

One thing to remember is that sometimes, even if you have successfully<br/>
lamented one mob, it will still follow the mob you pull.  This happened to<br/>
me last night in MM.  I was pulling familiars from the pathway that leads to<br/>
the graveyard.  Three familiars were in sight, all various distances from<br/>
where I was standing.  I lamented the first two in order and attacked the<br/>
third one, which was the furthest of the three away from me.  Unfortunately<br/>
all three followed me back to my group.  I think the best tactic is to<br/>
lament all the mobs that are nearby and then go back to the first one, i.e.<br/>
the one closest to your group, and attack it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; how long does the song usually last?  i mean is it like druid harmony<br/>
&gt; &gt; where i cast it and it lasts a good 5 minutes per mob casted on? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Well, there have been reports of it lasting quite a while, but since<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t take any mana, just time, I would always redo it before a<br/>
&gt; battle.<br/>
&gt; Remember, if something goes wrong, you can always use Selo&#39;s to get out of<br/>
&gt; it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Still not sure how great effect using an instrument has on it, but<br/>
&gt; just to be sure, I always use my lute.<br/>
