<div id="ygrps-yiv-168316995">Well, here&#39;s one for you, yesterday at work an<br/>
employee was fired.  I was finishing reading this list<br/>
at the time and eager to get home to play.  Time was<br/>
4:30.  4:45 said employee was in the parking lot with<br/>
a 9mm threatning to kill our HR director.  4:55 SWAT<br/>
Team arrives.  5:00 I walk out to my car and go home<br/>
anyway, no damn sniper is going to keep me from cazic<br/>
tonite. :P  Anyway, I think I was pretty safe, anymore<br/>
than a hundred yards and a 9 is pretty inaccurate,<br/>
right?  Besides, I think he had a low 1hd missle stat.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s because I read the list at work.  I<br/>
&gt; should read it<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m home with a frosty brew in my hand.<br/>
