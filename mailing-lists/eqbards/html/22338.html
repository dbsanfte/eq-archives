<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245106363">Note that I get the &#39;that is not a legal target master&#39; message each and<br/>
every time I have my hotkey with the /pet attack.  About ninety percent of<br/>
the time - it does in fact attack its target despite that message (not to<br/>
say that there aren&#39;t in fact problems with long complex hotkey scripts...)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The only times I have trouble getting my pet to attack (with the 39<br/>
&gt; song) is if the command comes too close to a previous /pet command or<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m too far away from him to hear the message.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also have trouble with too many commands in one hot key.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to do is:<br/>
<br/>
/assist Fred<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
/say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
/pet target<br/>
/attack off<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But it rarely works.  In this case, what seems to get missed is the assist<br/>
portion.  It seems like there is a resolution time for assist and it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been resolved before the /pet attack, so my pet tells me &#39;that is not a<br/>
legal target master&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to choose between separate Assist key (which I always have<br/>
anyway) or trying to add a pause in there.<br/>
<br/>
Other thoughts?<br/>
