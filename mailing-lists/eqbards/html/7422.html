<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260211732">Recently, I have had some very bad luck with invis and crossing zones.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically - I have invis up and zone or get gated.  As soon as I get<br/>
control over my char - I get the &quot;you become&quot; visible msg.  Everytime. This<br/>
is NOT good when you are gating into CT and are mere lev 26/27.  Also NOT<br/>
good when you gate out of CT and Hurd is parked on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
Geez Hurd I wish you would get it through your thick skull: there IS a place<br/>
in the realm for half elves - damn it! Stop saying there isn&#39;t!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, back to your question, would it work?  Prolly.  Would it be worth it?<br/>
Not to me.  (brag time) I am now doing most of my serious fighting in my<br/>
regular group! (damn I love the sound of those words) And we have a cleric!<br/>
Woo Hoo!  Life rocks now that he is over level 29!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I try to stay binded at the bank in High Keep. If (or shud I say when) I<br/>
die, I have lots of friends to talk to while I mem my spells and my party<br/>
does CR.  Just about the time I am done memming, they call me and say<br/>
&quot;consent me&quot; so they can drag my corpse to a safe loot spot.  And then that<br/>
magic box: &quot;do you want to be revived? yes or no?&quot;  Ohh that is soo nice!!!<br/>
<br/>
So this binding business is fast becoming a distant nightmare.  I guess you<br/>
pay some dues for 29 levels but then there are some nice perks in store for<br/>
those who have dome the smart thing:  built a well balanced, regular group.<br/>

		Had an idea I wanted to run by you guys.  If it will work,<br/>
its a possible<br/>
		way for bards to get bound in evil cities and safely return<br/>
to their corpse<br/>
		if they die.  <br/>
<br/>
		Step 1: Bard has two flutes in his inventory.  One is in a<br/>
container and<br/>
		another in a main inventory slot.<br/>
		Step 2: Bard groups with someone who can bind and gets bound<br/>
in an evil city<br/>
		right next to the zone border.<br/>
		Step 3: The bard and the person who bound him go into the<br/>
next zone, i.e.<br/>
		Innothule Swamp, Feerot, and duel right next to the zone<br/>
border to the evil<br/>
		city.  Bard lets the other person kill him in the duel.<br/>
		Step 4: Bard reappears in evil city, goes to the zone where<br/>
he is killed,<br/>
		and loots everything from his corpse except the flute in the<br/>
main inventory.<br/>
		Bard sings invis song, using flute that was in a container,<br/>
to get past<br/>
		guards and goes adventuring.<br/>
		Step 5: If bard dies while adventuring, he can then loot his<br/>
corpse to get<br/>
		the second flute, sing invis song, and safely get back to<br/>
his corpse. <br/>
		Step 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 to get another corpse<br/>
with spare flute.<br/>
<br/>
		I have never dueled anyone so am not certain how it works.<br/>
I assume you<br/>
		appear at your bind point when you get killed in a duel.  I<br/>
also assume your<br/>
		corpse remains in place (duration based on your level) as<br/>
long as there is<br/>
		equipment still on it.  This procedure also assumes that the<br/>
bard doesn&#39;t<br/>
		get attacked and killed in the evil city while he is waiting<br/>
to appear (i.e.<br/>
		during LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  <br/>
