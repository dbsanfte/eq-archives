<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027817105">Its more likely to be religion.  I had a friend who went there and got<br/>
slaughtered despite never having even seen a froggie before in his life.  I<br/>
wonder if any of us lorekeeper&#39;s out there has any charts showing the<br/>
effects of various religions on your factions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My bard had never killed a froggie and went into Upper Guk for the first<br/>
time<br/>
last night.  At 25th level I didn&#39;t run into anything higher than a few<br/>
blues.<br/>
And yet when I did run into blues they attacked me.  I assume it&#39;s bard<br/>
hate.<br/>
Has anyone else had this problem in Guk?  My monk went there for the first<br/>
time at 19th, and nothing attacked him, even though stuff was yellow and<br/>
even<br/>
red to him.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You and I think alike:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have yet to kill a froglok so my faction with them should be<br/>
indifferent.<br/>
&gt; This should allow me to safely go whereever the spawn is for the Guise and<br/>
&gt; pay someone to let me loot it.  Anyone have a idea of how much I should<br/>
&gt; offer for the looting rights?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the subject of twinking, or at least related to it.  I would very<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to obtain a Guise of the Deceiver.  Wait, don&#39;t flame me yet I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; its<br/>
&gt; &gt; No Drop.  I would be willing to accompany a party to Lower Guk if they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; going there anyhow and pay for the right to loot one off the assassin.<br/>
&gt; &gt; From<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I understand there are groups hunting him for his rare drop,<br/>
whatever<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is, that already have one for everyone in their party.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to find anyone like this on E&#39;ci but my higher level contacts are<br/>
&gt; &gt; limited.  If anyone is going there and would be interested in minorly<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinking my poor little bard please let me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are several quests I&#39;d like to explore and this is the only way<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; get the chance short of retiring my bard for about 6 months to build up<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; &gt; evil character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; thank you for your time in this blatant request for aid and assistance.<br/>
