<b>Subject:</b> (OT) Zone Crash Bug (Long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906709890">I had never had a problem with any serious bugs until this list started<br/>
talking about them so much (thanks, guys =P).  Now I can&#39;t seem to avoid<br/>
them, it&#39;s insane how many of these things I&#39;ve run over in the past<br/>
week or two.<br/>
<br/>
In reference to the dying-as-you-zone-and-comming-out-at-full-health<br/>
bug, I had an interesting variation of that happen to me yesterday on<br/>
the Tallon Zek (PvP-Teams) server.<br/>
<br/>
I was hunting in a group in the Gorge, slaying mino&#39;s and muddites, when<br/>
some poor sap trained an Evil Eye to the runnyeye zone (close to where<br/>
my party was hunting).  Well, most of my group was smart (and quick)<br/>
enough to zone out in time, but I (being the fool I am) decided to climb<br/>
up the wall and see if I couldn&#39;t sit just out of the eye&#39;s sight.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that worked for a bit, long enough for an older (19-20 IIRC)<br/>
magician to come and try his luck on the eye.  Well, he was doing all<br/>
right, he got the allready hurt eye down to just a sliver, when all of a<br/>
sudden, he stopped fighting.  Well, I didn&#39;t realize what happened right<br/>
away, but he had been charmed.  Anyways, me being the fool that I am,<br/>
decided to help the magician out.  I jumped off the wall and jumped in<br/>
to face the eye head on.  This is where I will point out that my<br/>
character on Tallon Zek is only 13th level right now, and not much of a<br/>
match for an eye at all.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Well, needless to say, I was quickly knocked down to half a bubble and<br/>
was making my way to the zone.  Just as I hit the zone wall, I crashed<br/>
out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Upon returning to Norrath, the character screen showed my wireframe in<br/>
full armour and my location was Runny Eye.  Good enough, I must have<br/>
made it!<br/>
<br/>
So I enter the world and meet with my party who are all amazed to see me<br/>
alive.  (This is when I noticed I was back to full health).<br/>
Well, we try to regroup and realize we can&#39;t (fair enough, I had just<br/>
gone LD, and my ghost was still grouped with them.)  So we all camp to<br/>
fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Upon returning to the character select screen, I notice my wireframe is<br/>
now naked, and my location was Rivervale (my current bind spot).<br/>
This startled me a bit, but hey, I must have somehow died while camping<br/>
(after this last week of bugs, it wouldn&#39;t suprize me).<br/>
<br/>
So I enter the world, hurry on to Runnyeye and go looking for my corpse.<br/>
Well, /corpse reported that I didn&#39;t have a corpse in the zone.<br/>
Strange, I thought.  Well, I zoned into Beholder again to rejoin my<br/>
party and see if they had seen anything.<br/>
<br/>
Well, one of my group members reported that he had just seen me charmed<br/>
by an evil eye and was following it around dutifully as it&#39;s pet. (Note,<br/>
it had been almost an hour since the battle with the eye at this point).<br/>
<br/>
Well, after all was said and done, this is what I figured out happened:<br/>
<br/>
Just as I zoned, I was hit by the (then) charmed magician and dropped.<br/>
(not killed.)  My computer crashes.  My character then splits into two.<br/>
The first one is laying on the ground in Beholder, the second is zoning<br/>
into runnyeye linkdead.  Well, the one in beholder regains conciousness<br/>
and is then quickly charmed by the Evil Eye.  Theone in runnyeye zones<br/>
in with less than 1 hit, and the server gets confused and gives me full<br/>
health.<br/>
When I camped, the server realized there were two of me, and promptly<br/>
had them both killed, and one of the corpses removed.  I later found my<br/>
corpse way into the maze in the gorge, much further than I ever could<br/>
have gotten safely without a bit of help.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I&#39;m about ready for bug week to end =)  This new patch has<br/>
something against me, and I want to know what it is before my corpse<br/>
ends up not comming back next time =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
