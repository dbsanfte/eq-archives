<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851092924">I am at work and can&#39;t get on to the Internet now to check out the post.<br/>
So maybe someone can clarify this for me.  Is Absor also referring to Psalm<br/>
of warmth and cooling?  They have &quot;damage shields&quot;, not damage absorption<br/>
shields.  If the Psalms are being nerfed I&#39;ll be pretty pissed... I like<br/>
the damage shields.  I would like to assume that Absor is refering to ONLY<br/>
damage absorption shields but assuming something that Verant does only<br/>
makes and ass out of you and me.<br/>

&gt;&quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>
&gt;songs with the next patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>
&gt;Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>
&gt;Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day. Its secondary<br/>
&gt;resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>
&gt;it will require an instrument.<br/>
&gt;The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>
&gt;tentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>
&gt;been nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>
&gt;perhaps).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pixie Strike is good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Song of Twilight is good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Single target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>
&gt;As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>
&gt;song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>
&gt;used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>
&gt;enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>
