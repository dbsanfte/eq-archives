<div id="ygrps-yiv-310241955">Hang out in MM. That sounds kinda silly but if you aren&#39;t able to camp the<br/>
ballroom yourself, someone that is camping there will often let those drums<br/>
start rotting. They should be cheapest to buy there as well. I&#39;ve known<br/>
campers to give the drums away to anyone that can get to it without training<br/>
the area simply because the drum would poof otherwise. <br/>
