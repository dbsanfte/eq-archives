&gt; WARNING.  bronze and plate look exactly the same except for color.  the<br/>
&gt; helms on wood elf males and females are hidious.  i wear a fine silk turbin<br/>
&gt; off the sand giant Hatar, looks like cloth so doesn&#39;t show on body.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Warning?  I think the wood elf male plate helm is the coolest plate helm in the<br/>
game, bar none!  I love that giant bird or whatever it is on the front.   The<br/>
players in my party used to tease me about it a little until I had the full<br/>
plate suit though, because on its own, it makes you look a little top heavy.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s all a matter of taste, but I really have to disagree with you on<br/>
this one :)<br/>
