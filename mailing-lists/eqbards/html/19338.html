<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655302915">Right cause if the client controlled it totally (and I didn&#39;t want to bring<br/>
this up and start another exploit thread but here goes anyhow) it would be<br/>
possible to hack the client and make a drop without actually dropping the<br/>
object.  that would give free duplication of objects as one got &#39;dropped&#39;<br/>
into the server world while the other one remained on the cursor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s that clear that the client decides the action.  the<br/>
server<br/>
keeps track of all the locations of objects.  the locations of objects<br/>
(other<br/>
characters and npcs) determines what function is called,<br/>
drop/trade/give/etc.<br/>
it would make much more sense to have the whole drop/trade/give/etc code<br/>
on the server side.  in other words the client can just send a<br/>
mouse_click_happened<br/>
interrupt along with x/y/z coordinates of the mouse location in the window.<br/>
then the server decides what to do with it.<br/>
