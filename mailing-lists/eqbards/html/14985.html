<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745470970">Got of couple other observations/speculations to throw in.<br/>
<br/>
First off, there are some mobs in MM with the capability to cast See Invis.<br/>
Which mobs those are I have no idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Case in point: The first time I ever saw a will sapper I had the invis song<br/>
up.   I conned it and it was ready to attack.  Before I could back off, it<br/>
cast a spell that dropped my stamina bar to zero.  It killed me fairly<br/>
quickly after that.  Wary of will sappers after that incident,  I later saw<br/>
one (while Invis song was up) standing behind the crypt in the GY (near the<br/>
secret wall to the jail).  My group was camping the GY so when I saw the<br/>
will sapper it had just recently spawned.  This time it conned indifferent.<br/>
I walked right up to it and it didn&#39;t attack me.  I pulled it back to the<br/>
group so don&#39;t know if it would have started buffing itself had I not pulled<br/>
it.  Based on those two incidents, I assume that will sappers do not<br/>
inherently see thru invis.  They either cast it on themself or get it from<br/>
another mob.  <br/>
<br/>
Second off, I have been told that at night in MM undead mobs will spawn<br/>
inside the castle.  Once again I&#39;m not certain what the names of these mobs<br/>
are.  These undead mobs will see thru invis<br/>
<br/>
Third, if any of the mobs that can cast See Invis are pulled to the zone via<br/>
a train, on their way back to their spawn point they will likely buff any<br/>
familiars along the path from the zone to the graveyard.  That explains how<br/>
the familiars could see thru your song.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A possible theory I&#39;ve heard so far (also mentioned by someone here) is<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; there are mobs that cast see invoice on others.  I wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>
&gt; surprised with the pathing bugs if they are casting from a distance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as the mobs around the lake - I think they are different.  I ran<br/>
&gt; past<br/>
&gt; them and didn&#39;t get attacked - but the ones in the passageway to the<br/>
&gt; graveyard - and the cave always seem to.  As far as the castle mobs - when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; was lower and hunted by the lake - I rarely if ever was attacked by<br/>
&gt; them -unless someone attacked one of them...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While the cast see invoice theory may be the answer - I&#39;ve been attacked<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; many times trying to get to and from the graveyard/cave area - I believe<br/>
&gt; that Verant added See Invoice to some of those mobs...<br/>
