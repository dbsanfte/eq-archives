&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>
&gt; observations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>
&gt; (Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>
&gt; Every song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>
&gt; I can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>
&gt; every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>
&gt; check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>
&gt; spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>
&gt; casting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>
&gt; seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>
&gt; interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>
&gt; casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>
&gt; able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>
&gt; and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>
&gt; sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>
&gt; then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>
&gt; might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>
&gt; again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>
&gt; observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>
<br/>

fight the necro at the fear portal. I was chaining and fearing here,<br/>
and even while running in terror she was still able to cast spells. If<br/>
you&#39;ve ever been feared you&#39;ll know this is completely impossible for a<br/>
PC character.<br/>
