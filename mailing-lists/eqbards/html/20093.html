<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862863330">Don&#39;t you run into trouble using this sequence on the retargetting the pet<br/>
when the charm breaks early?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, last night I had charm and fear breaking immediatley<br/>
after the &quot;glaze&quot; and &quot;flees&quot;  messages a lot last night.  Has anyone else<br/>
noticed this?  There also seems to have been a lot more &quot;missed notes&quot; than<br/>
usual.<br/>
