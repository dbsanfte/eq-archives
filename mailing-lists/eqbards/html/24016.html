<div id="ygrps-yiv-696933393">The level 24 song is ultravision/see invis.  This song was relatively but not entirely useless until<br/>
Verant modified level 19 to be not just invis but invis/see invis.  At which point, they never bothered to<br/>
address the fact that this made level 24 pointless.  So looking at the weakness of 24 to justify the<br/>
weakness of DDD isn&#39;t a good comparison.  Particularly since Verant just explicitly modified DDD to make<br/>
it &quot;good&quot; in their way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Verant has never in any way indicated that DDD was tuned with PvP in mind.  In general, their<br/>
approach is to make songs/spells work differently on blue and red servers in order to balance for PvP.  In<br/>
the absence of any other information, I am forced to assume that they believe that this song is balanced<br/>
for blue server play.  I couldn&#39;t disagree with them more.<br/>
