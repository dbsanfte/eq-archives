<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070950363">Go to South Ro!  It&#39;s easy to get to... just follow the coast through<br/>
Oasis, and when you get to the mountain wall just hang a right and you&#39;ll<br/>
find the pass soon enough.  SGs aren&#39;t that dangerous when you move like the<br/>
wind.<br/>
<br/>
So Ro has been getting a little more crowded lately at peak hours, but still<br/>
not as much as other zones.  You should be able to 1) Lament a few orc camps<br/>
(that are never camped!) if alone, or 2) join up with some trolls (who never<br/>
get the benefit of a good bard) and kill Dervishes for their bronze weapons<br/>
and rings.  In the NW corner is a euridite merchant, and the center a few<br/>
dark elf female merchants.  South Ro is nice because it just isn&#39;t that<br/>
crowded, and it&#39;s always fun to hang out with trolls who talk like total<br/>
morons.<br/>
<br/>
For real fun, find Innothule Swamp in the SW corner, hang a left and follow<br/>
the coast, and enter upper Guk.  Kill a lot of frogloks, and you should come<br/>
out with a nice collection of woven armor.  (I&#39;ve been in Guk for hours and<br/>
found not a thing, then found 3 woven gloves in a row.)  Take the woven to<br/>
Qeynos where there are lots of monks and higher demand for the stuff.  Sell<br/>
any gloves you find for as much as you can, O&#39; 8pp or more.  I made 60 pp<br/>
with a few packfulls from Guk to Qeynos, and that was with people telling me<br/>
my prices were more than fair.<br/>

&gt;Did you lose a magic weapon? or just your regular mino axe / store bought<br/>
&gt;weapon?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not sure where you&#39;re at, but here&#39;s some ideas:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) From your message it sounds like you also want experience. If not you<br/>
&gt;can kill every orc pawn in east and west commons. Cloth armor and weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Paw is an excellent source for weapons(5s - 2.5gp), cloth armor (1-4gp)<br/>
&gt;and occasional shields (8gp) AND experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Giant snakes, giant rattle snakes and asps. These are a source of giant<br/>
&gt;snake fangs (4-5gp). You might want a cleric along on this one. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) Steamfont. Harpies and skeletons and minos.<br/>

&gt;Hello fellow loremasters!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Due to my recent adventures with the rogue Evil Eye and resulting loss of<br/>
&gt;my only decent weapon I find a desperate need to acquire wealth.  Could<br/>
&gt;anyone offer any suggestions for a 10th level, sigh was 11th once, bard to<br/>
&gt;really earn some coin?  I have found it difficult to make much as most of<br/>
&gt;the critters I get xp from are terribly cash poor in terms of loot<br/>
&gt;available.  I have a monk friend so can take on stuff slightly more<br/>
&gt;powerful than I alone. All suggestions welcomed!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;wait...almost all...if someone shouts kill snakes I think I&#39;ll scream...<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;      &quot;and no one shall work for money,<br/>
&gt;       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
&gt;     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>
&gt;        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;oops, looks like I&#39;ll be working for money, kust more proof the world&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;perfect };-)<br/>
