<div id="ygrps-yiv-669158853">Wow, am I relieved not to be the oldest one (40) playing this. Whew!<br/>
<br/>
All in all - given the nature of the bard class - I think it probably<br/>
appeals more to an older, more mature player.<br/>
<br/>
We have moved past having to &#39;prove&#39; ourselves - and have learned the value<br/>
of support - even if it&#39;s unrecognized support.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t WANT to be the hero - I really, really enjoy helping others do that.<br/>
<br/>
To me, the bard class is just about as good as it gets for being a great<br/>
support character.<br/>

&gt;&gt;     What!  gasp!  You mean I&#39;m not the only 30+ year old in the game...<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Yea!  There is hope for me after all...<br/>

&gt;Hah!  I laugh on your young lapel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m 51, married, and have 2 married sons who between them have 3 kids of<br/>
&gt;their own.  Both of them play EverQuest, too.  Can anyone beat that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Neither of them wants to play a bard, but it other than old inertia to play<br/>
&gt;a dwarf warrior, it was my obvious, enthusiastic choice.<br/>
