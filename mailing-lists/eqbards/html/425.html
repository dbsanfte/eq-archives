<div id="ygrps-yiv-838342563">Twisting songs: playing for instance Whistling Warsong and Anthem de Arms so<br/>
that both shields are on the screen at once.  Singing one, getting the<br/>
shield up, then stop singing and starting another, then going back to the<br/>
first song to keep that shield up.  Some call playing three like this<br/>
juggling.<br/>
<br/>
I have always managed to pull it off, even at lower levels.  When you miss a<br/>
note, just immediately double click the icon you need again, should only<br/>
take a split second between each attempt until you get the graphical<br/>
pyrotechnics.  Doesn&#39;t seem that I miss notes that often, though, ever.  I<br/>
heard charisma had more effect on songs than dexterity.  Dexterity, to me,<br/>
seems like it would have an effect on more physical things like how often<br/>
one can get in blows with a weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Hm, how often is it your missing notes anyway?  Perhaps should test this<br/>
with lv 1 bard with low charisma/dexterity high charisma/dexterity.  The<br/>
manual says that bards need intelligence, but I don&#39;t believe this.<br/>
