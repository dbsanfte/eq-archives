 </span></blockquote>Minkin, you said it yourself: You&#39;re overheating.  And it sounds like more <br/>
than just the processor, too.   You may have overheated your video card as <br/>
well.  Simply downclocking it may not solve the problem if the damage has <br/>
already been done.  Start saving pennies, it may be time for a new MB and <br/>
processor.  I&#39;m in the same boat myself right now.<br/>
<br/>
As long as we&#39;re off-topic, though, anyone out there gaming on Win2k, and <br/>
which do you feel is better (for gaming): Win2k, WinME, or Win98?<br/>
