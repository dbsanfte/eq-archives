  Hey I wonder if that Sr. Admin position is still open at Verant?<br/>
<br/>
  Hehe.  I have all the things they require except a CCIE.. well,<br/>
  that&#39;s ok, since there are less than a few thousand CCIE&#39;s in <br/>
  the world!  Silly Verant!  I almost have my CCNA.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
  Any Cisco freaks on the list?<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmm... my company works with Lucas.... hmmm, Verant is going to<br/>
  work with Lucas... hmmm... I smell a trip to California coming<br/>
  up ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, my boss is playing a huge interoffice Age of Empires <br/>
  game now.  Yesterday, it was Starcraft.  E3 here I come!  My<br/>
  homework last night from work was to demo a couple of new games<br/>
  coming out... I tell ya it&#39;s tough work - hehe.</div>
