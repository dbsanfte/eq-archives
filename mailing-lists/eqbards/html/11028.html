&gt; That&#39;s nice, but I&#39;ve been camping the predator for weeks and haven&#39;t got a<br/>
&gt; shard and I can&#39;t seem to find anyone on Prexus willing to sell or trade<br/>
&gt; one.  Additionally, I&#39;m told that above 30 it starts to get resisted A LOT<br/>
&gt; and being of the 29th song...  So given the shard seems out of the question:<br/>
&gt; Is a obsidian scimitar a good trade for a silvery war axe or should I hold<br/>
&gt; out for something better?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they are both about equal value. They&#39;re both about the same<br/>
rarity and require similar levels to get. Personally I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s much difference damage wise between a 6/22 and 6/25 and the proc<br/>
probably more than makes up for the difference except in the soluseks<br/>
where everything has a very high resist rate to fire based spells.<br/>
Personally I think the axe looks a bit unbalanced as an off hand weapon<br/>
when used with most of the weapons we can use for our primary hand. Also<br/>
the axe is probably more replacable later if you decide you want<br/>
another, as a lot more people camp that area than the predator.<br/>
<br/>
Are you killing both the predator and the foreman? They are so close<br/>
together you really should, and then you&#39;d also have a chance at the<br/>
obsidian scimitar, which isn&#39;t a bad weapon either.<br/>
