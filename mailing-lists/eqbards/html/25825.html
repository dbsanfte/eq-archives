<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450274008">Quite frankly, I find it hard to believe that a person is actually<br/>
&quot;twisting&quot; 5 songs.  Factor in cast times, and song duration after it ends,<br/>
and when twisting 4 songs, almost always, the first effect will drop before<br/>
you get back to it.  You can add amplification to a 4 song twist, and call<br/>
it 5, but when it comes time to refresh amplification, you&#39;ll probably lose<br/>
an effect just as you&#39;re trying to twist it back in, resulting in a catch up<br/>
effect where a song wears off a pulse or two before it can be refreshed, all<br/>
the way through the twist, so you&#39;ve only got 3 songs active anyway, not<br/>
counting amplification.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if anyone ever actually defined &quot;twisting&quot;.  To me, it is the<br/>
ability to keep the effects of multiple songs **active** on my group, or on<br/>
the mob, at ALL times.  A 3 song twist is common among high level bards (am<br/>
I a high level bard now?  :P ).  Why?  Because we&#39;ve been playing the class<br/>
long enough to realize that, under most circumstances, it is the best twist.<br/>
Some song lineups, and situations make a 4 song twist desired, and while<br/>
possible, it&#39;s a lot harder, and is only practical when the occassional<br/>
dropped effect isn&#39;t that big a deal.  Like manasong, which is a shot of<br/>
mana when pulsed, and not a regen effect.<br/>
<br/>
But when you&#39;re talking a song effect dropping for a duration of time, which<br/>
is what would happen in a 5 song twist...well, it&#39;s not really a twist.<br/>
<br/>
If you insist it is, then I&#39;d like to be the first to introduce myself as<br/>
the best bard in EQ, because I can twist 8.<br/>

One who twists three may be ROLE playing well, but logically one who twists<br/>
five is, obviously, contributing /more/ to the group. Period. One plus one<br/>
equals two, no matter how embarassing it may be to those with only one.</div>
