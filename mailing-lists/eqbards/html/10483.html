&gt; I&#39;d recommend that you stay outta Sol A.  I have a real dislike for goblins<br/>
&gt; in general (and I try not to be bigoted), but that place has a lot of<br/>
&gt; serious Wizards in it and they hit very hard.  They killed me twice at level<br/>
&gt; 34 over the weekend (once by simply knocking me into lava) while trying to<br/>
&gt; get my Firewalker Boots.  The place never has very many people in it,<br/>
&gt; despite have a really wonderful design and some very, very interesting<br/>
&gt; places and some very nice loot.  What that says to me is that the place is<br/>
&gt; slightly misdesigned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just to offer an opposing viewpoint on this.. I really like Sol A. With<br/>
a good group and good dungeon exploring techniques, it&#39;s a gas and quite<br/>
doable. And, because it&#39;s usually empty, it&#39;s one of the few places you<br/>
can really explore like a dungeon, rather than wandering around trying<br/>
to find an uncamped spot. The tricks I learned with my first character,<br/>
while exploring Lower Guk before anyone else was there, served just as<br/>
well with my new character in Sol A and Perma. Of course, again, you<br/>
need to be with a group of good players for this to work. Having a good<br/>
puller, people who know how to play their characters, and someone who<br/>
can do crowd control (enchanter/bard and druid/ranger) are necessities.<br/>
<br/>
The group I&#39;m currently playing with with my new character went into<br/>
Perma at 24 and came out with runed circlets, cold iron morning stars<br/>
and mammoth leggings in just one night. We went to Sol A in the late<br/>
20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s and got just about every special item out of there<br/>
as well.<br/>
