have to go to Field of Bone and try to get one from folks who can forage<br/>
them.  A couple rangers in my guild have gotten them and promised to save<br/>
&#39;em for me next time.  I have not had time to go there myself and auction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I am told that what you forage in the field of bone is actually just a<br/>
plain old Bunt Cake, whereas you need to mix that along with something else<br/>
in the oven in Droga to get a Burynai Bunt Cake. Has anyone found the recipe<br/>
of what you need to mix the bunt cake with to make the burynai cake?<br/>
