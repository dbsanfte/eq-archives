<div id="ygrps-yiv-146914274">I agree, I paid 100 plat about 2 weeks ago on E&#39;ci for my elf-hide gloves in<br/>
front of the Bank at Kelethin at 2 in the morning RL and I was pleased as<br/>
punch to do so - have no qualms whatsoever about it.  Heck, I can make 50<br/>
plat a night in Unrest if I work hard at it and even though my entire<br/>
fortune only amounts to around 300 plat, I like the elf-hide gloves a lot<br/>
better than the 100 plat.<br/>
<br/>
Its like the old comparison of potential energy vs. kinetic energy...the<br/>
money is potential and the gloves are kinetic...<br/>

&gt; One thing to keep in mind... EQ plat has no value in and of <br/>
&gt; itself.  Banks<br/>
&gt; do not pay interest.  There is no provision in the economy for capital<br/>
&gt; investment.  Money is just a store of value or meduim of <br/>
&gt; exchange.  500pp in<br/>
&gt; the bank is worthless.  A pair of Elf Hide Gloves has true <br/>
&gt; value - stats &<br/>
&gt; prestige.  The person who paid 375pp for them obvious felt <br/>
&gt; that they were<br/>
&gt; worth it compared to having 375pp in the bank doing nothing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Granted - he may have a hard time getting 375pp back out of <br/>
&gt; them but if he<br/>
&gt; wanted them that bad - he probably wont even think of getting <br/>
&gt; rid of them.<br/>
&gt; As you get older, your access to plats gets easier, your <br/>
&gt; stuffs get better.<br/>
&gt; So now you have most everything you want to wear and you have <br/>
&gt; 800pp in the<br/>
&gt; bank rotting away - now when you see something you want - you <br/>
&gt; can pretty<br/>
&gt; much have it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What drives most deals (sales) of items is how bad the buyer <br/>
&gt; wants something<br/>
&gt; and the convenience of getting it.  I have been on both sides <br/>
&gt; of pretty many<br/>
&gt; deals.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here we are in the Oasis d&#39; Mar<br/>
&gt; /auction Polar Bear Cloak AC8 +10HP +20svCold great for <br/>
&gt; casters anyone can<br/>
&gt; wear 40pp obo<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /ooc that&#39;s a rip they cost only 5pp <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /ooc yes but first travel to everfrost - get polar bear skin <br/>
&gt; - hire a ranger<br/>
&gt; - 4 hours to find karg - then he gets killed for his GZ - 4 <br/>
&gt; more hours to<br/>
&gt; find karg - 5pp to karg and travel back home<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /tell sylly will you take 30pp? can you meet me at the docks?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /tell whoever omw!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
