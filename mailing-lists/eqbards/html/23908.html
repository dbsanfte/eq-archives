&gt;except for bards. The reason that all other classes scale that way is<br/>
&gt;because of the way the mobs increase in power post 50. Bards however<br/>
&gt;progress in power linearly. An argument can be made that we give some power<br/>
&gt;for our wealth of abilities, but if you look at the very highest levels, we<br/>
&gt;lose all of those additional abilities. Fear caps at 51, Charm caps at 53<br/>
&gt;and Mez caps at 55. That means that a level 60 bard fighting level 55+ mobs<br/>
&gt;is a liability to the party instead of an asset. We can no longer crowd<br/>
&gt;control, our haste and slow is vastly inferior to enchanters and shamen, our<br/>
&gt;melee is pathetic (to say the least). Our only role at that point is mana<br/>
&gt;battery.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the problem that people don&#39;t realize is that the bard pretty much increases the<br/>
effectivity of other people in his/her party.  if our increases also went exponentially<br/>
and they affected the other class&#39;s exponential curves exponentially, you don&#39;t see<br/>
this as being a problem?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bards used to be useful in large raids for their ability to provide resists,<br/>
&gt;but given the influx of uber gear it is not difficult to obtain unbuffed<br/>
&gt;resists in the 150s in multiple areas. Add to that the soft cap on resists<br/>
&gt;and the fact that even with maxed resists many, many spells land anyway and<br/>
&gt;bards have little to no use in a raid. We can&#39;t provide our primary ability<br/>
&gt;(resists) and we don&#39;t do damage, so why bring us along?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which is why i was advocating making resists scale to 255 instead of 175.  any other<br/>
change would severely overbalance us in all other aspects of the game.<br/>
