<div id="ygrps-yiv-738015299">Sorry, I am just more than a little ticked off at the &quot;Black Helicopter&quot;<br/>
comment earlier in the chain. And someone saying this is being imagined<br/>
because someone brought it to our attention. What I am saying is I never<br/>
missed notes on the bulk of my songs prior to 2 weeks ago. I have not gone<br/>
out and kept track of #s because it isnt realistic to what I am doing in an<br/>
everchanging battle situation. I am in Lower Guk, the #s and types of mobs<br/>
is so fluid I may have to go from one strategy to a completely different one<br/>
mid battle, and a missed note can cause the death of our whole party. Dont<br/>
laugh till you&#39;ve been there, all frogs are not created equal. If I cant<br/>
play my twisted tunes I may as well sing the Mana song and melee without<br/>
worrying about being a Bard anymore.<br/>

&gt; Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>
&gt; missed notes everytime. It never fired. Are those good enough?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, you said &quot;maybe a total of 30 times&quot;.   Not exactly precise<br/>
numbers.<br/>
So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a 100 percent failure rate on a sample size of<br/>
30?  I<br/>
certainly understand why you&#39;d be upset.  Thing is, that&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>
believe when I haven&#39;t had a failure rate of higher than 10 percent on any<br/>
song<br/>
I&#39;ve tested with recently.  Nobody else is claiming 100 percent failure<br/>
rates<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be combative here, I&#39;m trying to figure out, with a little<br/>
rigor, what&#39;s happening here, because simply bitching about it isn&#39;t going<br/>
to<br/>
get the problem fixed, if there is one.<br/>
