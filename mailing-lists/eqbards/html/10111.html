<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906302686">One thing I think bears mentioning here, is there really is no use comparing<br/>
our class to others (especially if you are using an incredibly ambiguous<br/>
term such as power) A bards power scales upward with the size of his/her<br/>
group, as far as I&#39;m aware we are the only class that this holds true for.<br/>
For example, solo, my healing song heals 10 points of damage max per<br/>
round....with 2 people 20...with 3 30....etc etc. Everyone else&#39;s abilities<br/>
are fixed. Same with our Anthem type spells. If Im solo, the net benefit is<br/>
negligible, however the more people you add to the group, the more valuable<br/>
it becomes. A 10% speed bonus to one person is not nearly as effective as a<br/>
10% speed bonus for 4 people. Your net effectiveness scales up quickly when<br/>
you start adding more people.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to tell me I&#39;m wrong though  =) I just dont think there is any<br/>
point to comparing us to casters or melee classes. We are a truly unique<br/>
class =)<br/>

&gt; If you jump off a 10 story building you will fall.  That is a fact.<br/>
&gt; If you jump off a 10 story building you will die.  That is not a fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are the only person I know who does not know the difference between a<br/>
&gt; fact and an opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe Bards eventually become better than Shamans in melee, but not at<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to prevent me from being pummeled due<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the numerous stuns I received.  All shamans have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>
&gt; up, but it is still sufficient to stun a 17th level bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards are better than all hybrids in magical power?  Under what microscope<br/>
&gt; did you determine that?  At lower levels its obviously true as the other<br/>
&gt; hybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets examine them at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; Paladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3 minutes worth of Hymn with a<br/>
lute<br/>
&gt; and it takes them less time than that to meditate back the mana.  They<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; get Revive at their utmost level of spell use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>
&gt; Rangers probably have the weakest line of spells getting nothing above<br/>
Heal,<br/>
&gt; though they do get Wolf Form, cool but not overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>
&gt; spells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness DoT line is devastating as it<br/>
&gt; destroys our best defense, Acellerando and it stacks with their Heat<br/>
Blood.<br/>
&gt; They also now have the lifetap series.  All this aside their Harm Touch<br/>
&gt; alone is a devastating if slow to recharge weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>
&gt; number of spells than the other hybrids do though.  Are our abilities<br/>
&gt; obviously better, I would not say so.  Better in a full group of six<br/>
maybe,<br/>
&gt; better in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.  Even if we were better it<br/>
&gt; certainly would not be 5-6 times better and that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>
&gt; relate to us in terms of melee skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now since I have stated that bards magical abilities might not be so much<br/>
&gt; better than some of the other hybrids, rangers excluded as their spells<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; truly weak, feel free to call me a liar.  That will just be one more<br/>
&gt; definition you will need to look up on Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>
&gt; &#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To further turn your argument around:<br/>
&gt; Bards cannot beat any caster consistently in pure magical combat. (though<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>
&gt; Bards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee type consistently in pure<br/>
melee<br/>
&gt; combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Neither of those statements however true prove we are weaker than those<br/>
&gt; classes any more than yours prove we are equal in power.  In my opinion,<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; are weaker than several of the other classes.  The weakness is not<br/>
generally<br/>
&gt; overbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; think a realignment of our skills would suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>
&gt; modifications to our spells other than including the missing ones and<br/>
fixing<br/>
&gt; the broken ones.  An added melee skill like Parry which succeeds more<br/>
often<br/>
&gt; than Dodge, and some raised caps on skills that are currently of debatable<br/>
&gt; usefulness would help as well.  Most Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>
&gt; self-sufficient characters while we are definitely not designed to be very<br/>
&gt; capable on our own.  We do best in groups due to the nature of our spells.<br/>
&gt; It is this very grouping nature that further undermines the usefulness of<br/>
&gt; our other skills as there will often be present others in the group whose<br/>
&gt; skill so far overshadows ours in those other areas that we might as well<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; have the skill at all. There is no benefit to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>
&gt; Locks when there is a rogue in the group with more than double your skill.<br/>
&gt; If we were meant to be characters who could function on their own and do<br/>
&gt; nearly everything, if not well, that would be different.  However, we are<br/>
&gt; not.  We are meant to group and for every member we add to our group some<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; our skills become superfluous just as our magical powers become more<br/>
potent.<br/>

&gt; 1. Bards are better than all Pure Casters and Priests in melee. (MAG, WIZ,<br/>
&gt; ENC, NEC, CLR, SHA, DRU)<br/>
&gt; 2. Bards are better than all hybrids in magical power. (PAL, RNG, SK)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
&gt; understand these facts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone tries to contradict one of the above statements, I will point<br/>
&gt; them out as a liar.  Especially to those Bards who have been on this list<br/>
&gt; quite a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to the nature of my messages, in the past I have made some poor<br/>
choices.<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;ve tried to do better.  I looked at my last five messages and saw<br/>
&gt; nothing out of the ordinary.  I&#39;d be glad to discuss any of my posts with<br/>
&gt; you or anyone else in private, not on the list.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Just curious, what server do you play on and do you play a bard?<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason I ask is because you emails are consistently sniping in nature<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally flamebait.  I&#39;ll be the first to defend your right to free<br/>
&gt; speech<br/>
&gt; &gt; however I would ask that you perhaps temper somewhat your future remarks<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the fact this is a public forum meant for discussion -- closing<br/>
doors<br/>
&gt; &gt; via naked accusations and bombastic proclamations offers little room for<br/>
&gt; &gt; such to take place on a mutually respectful level.<br/>
