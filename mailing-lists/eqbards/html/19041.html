<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-169531754">nope, the Overseer (and the boss mob, forget his name) are both SUPPOSED to<br/>
have a 1000dmg AE spell on them.  They cast it alot.  It was NOT toned down<br/>
in the patch (the instance I am talking about occurred yesterday)<br/>
<br/>
The Oozes and the casters in the dungeon have all been fixed though.  Oozes<br/>
used to have a 900dmg DOT and the casters were casting 50th level spells<br/>
(they&#39;ve been reduced down to the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s that they should be at)<br/>
<br/>
Overall Dalnir is a total bore.  (90% of it is green at 40th).  The boss mob<br/>
and his PH are absolute hell (though 40+ casters with pets can take him<br/>
pretty easily).  A really good group with a full cleric might be able to do<br/>
it too.  An enchanter is a must unless you&#39;re just going to pet/root/nuke<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well, they did patch saying that Dalnir mobs were casting spells WELL<br/>
above thier ability. Hopefully that<br/>
&gt; was fixed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Only thing you need in Dalnir is off the Kly Imprecator (sp?).  The<br/>
ancient<br/>
&gt; &gt; coin (Royal Crown of Dalnir) for the Ancient Coin Quest<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hehe.  And I got one long before I went to Dalnir.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; HOWEVER:<br/>
&gt; &gt; The boss mob of the dungeon drops the Necklace of Superiority or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5AC, +5 to all stats.  +10 to all resists.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Be warned:  His placeholder has a 1000dmg AOE Attack.  So does he and he<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2x the hp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The placeholder (Kly Overseer) dropped a full group of 6 40+ members<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (oh, did I mention he was blue to level 39 ?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;re starting to explore Dalnir now in force.  I&#39;m told there&#39;s bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there but I think it&#39;s just a ploy to get me to log in my bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Without huge spoilers, anything a bard can look forward to in here?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cleric?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course I&#39;ll continue going even if there&#39;s just xp and good times<br/>
&gt; &gt; alone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s just nice to have a goal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (admit it, lower guk was a lot more exciting to explore when you saw<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people were hauling out of there :P)<br/>
