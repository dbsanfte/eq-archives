<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The FS Rapier has the same speed as the dirk, but one less damage.  If you<br/>
can&#39;t find a dirk, the FS rapier is a good weapon, as it only cost me 7 pp.<br/>
The<br/>
best cheap weapon to get your skill up with is a FS dagger, at 19 delay, you<br/>
get more skill checks to get skill raises with.  I can&#39;t imagine this<br/>
costing more<br/>
than 2 pp.  This is from pc&#39;s not from the NPC&#39;s, they charge combine prices<br/>
for them.<br/>

&gt;It is inferior to the Dragoon Dirk, and is MUCH more expensive, too. I was<br/>
&gt;given a FS Rapier in trade, which you can buy from the vendor for approx<br/>
&gt;280pp. Well, I tried to sell it for 100pp, and EVERYONE laughed at me.<br/>
&gt;Looking at the stats... yes... a Dragoon Dirk IS better, and you can get<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NEVER buy those from vendors, players sell them for less than their regular<br/>
steel equivalents.  I was carrying a steel rapier (I love the 3 musketeers<br/>
rapier + parrying dagger look), and saw an auction for a FS rapier, I<br/>
offered<br/>
7 pp, got it, and sold my regular one back for 11.5pp.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t confuse FS weapons with Well Balanced weapons, FS aren&#39;t magical.<br/>
