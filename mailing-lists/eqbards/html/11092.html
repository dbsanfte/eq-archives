<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035896454">i went out and got all the lambent armor when the quests first began.  it<br/>
was a lot of fun for me, and i had not gotten the rest of my imbrued at the<br/>
time.  pretty much the day after i got all the lambent items, i did complete<br/>
my imbrued set, and the lambent has pretty much been in the bank since.<br/>
well there are a couple of items i want for my wizard: smr and runed cowl.<br/>
now even a full set of lambent is not worth an smr, i would probably throw<br/>
in a ykehsa, molten cloak, and cash (that&#39;s all i got in the bank other than<br/>
the lambent and my old set of rubicite).  but, someone did want a full set<br/>
of lambent, and i said well how about a runed cowl.  he had to think about<br/>
it, and so did i.  the deal did not go through, as he did not have a cowl<br/>
but was thinking of spending the 10000pp or so it would cost him to get one,<br/>
to save him from getting all the lambent armor.  took me 3 days, but that is<br/>
obviously above average.  so what do you think of the full lambent set for a<br/>
runed cowl trade?  my guild was split on the subject, as i was.<br/>
