<div id="ygrps-yiv-899928193">nag is a lot lot tougher than vox, and with around 200FR, i would take<br/>
0.25-1 bubble damage per breath spell.  if i did not boost this, i believe i<br/>
would be taking 1+ bubbles every time.  but i don&#39;t want to test that hehe<br/>
(just over a bubb left in 50).  i believe you, but i don&#39;t get the same<br/>
results.  we only lost 1 person out of 24, and it wasn&#39;t me =)  i think your<br/>
character is bugged (Shada lets Harmonic know that she was JUST KIDDING!).<br/>
<br/>
if that bug you describe exists that would totally suck =/  i haven&#39;t<br/>
noticed it, but i haven&#39;t been looking either.  glad you got in the game and<br/>
had some fun tho =)<br/>

&gt;   my all time record high but still got waxxed.  It&#39;s _very_ hard to <br/>
&gt;   beat 230 cold. In fact it&#39;s near impossible to go above 250.<br/>

&gt;   Vox breath attack one:   0.5  bubbles.<br/>
&gt;   Vox breath attack two:   1.5  bubbles.<br/>
&gt;   Vox breath attack three: 0.25 bubbles.<br/>
&gt;   Vox breath attack four:  1.5  bubbles.<br/>
&gt;   Vox breath attack five:  dead.  (thats right: 2+ bubbles) </span></blockquote></div>
