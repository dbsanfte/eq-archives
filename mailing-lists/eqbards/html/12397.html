<br/>
Yesterday I posted about an event I&#39;m trying to schedule in Mistmoore.<br/>
Thats still in the works.  Wanted to let all the E&#39;ci bards know that there<br/>
is a raid scheduled tonight in Mistmoore (6PM PST).  Bextrii is running it<br/>
and if you don&#39;t know her she knows a lot about conducting raids in MM.  If<br/>
you don&#39;t have a gypsy lute yet, tonight would be a good opportunity for you<br/>
to get one for free (assuming bards camping the castle don&#39;t need one).  <br/>
