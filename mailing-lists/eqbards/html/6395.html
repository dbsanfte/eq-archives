&gt;She did over 600 points of damage before my screen could register any<br/>
&gt;damage, I went from Full health to dead without a screen refresh. It might<br/>
&gt;have been two of them casting I am not sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow, on with the story,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Step seven: corpse recovery<br/>
&gt;Step eight: Kill some Yard Trash<br/>
&gt;Step nine: Peek around a bit<br/>
&gt;Step ten, eleven,twelve, thirteen: See a Teir&#39;Dal woman in full plate, fire<br/>

&gt;I took all the posts about it from here and sent them to the party members,<br/>
&gt;who kind of pegged me as being pessimistic on the issue *laughs*<br/>
