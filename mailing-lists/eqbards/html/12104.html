<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280490883">I was dueling a monk last night.  He was 6 levels above me, and I<br/>
could still frequently stun him with it.  Seeing as this is the first<br/>
experience I&#39;ve had with the song, it seemed to work rather well.<br/>
<br/>
	Of course the monk still wiped the floor with me, even with a cleric<br/>
healing me (no, it wasn&#39;t cheating, it was just a friendly intra-guild<br/>
duel).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you use it on yourself, it&#39;s either resist or stun.  It<br/>
&gt; seems to be more effective against mobs as well, although it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resisted more now that they added the MR debuff to it (or<br/>
&gt; maybe all the mobs I&#39;ve been fighting lately have MR buffs).  <br/>
&gt; There are still cases of the song seemingly not working, but<br/>
&gt; they are not frequent enough for me to consider the song less<br/>
&gt; than useless.<br/>
