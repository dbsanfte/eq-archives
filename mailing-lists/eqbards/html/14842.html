&gt;Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>
&gt;Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
&gt;shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>
&gt;seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>
&gt;many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>
&gt;be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>
&gt;makes the bard fun?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have played since last April, have a level 18 druid, level 13<br/>
enchanter, and level 8 bard. (who I played up to 16 on Test then<br/>
decided I&#39;d rather play on Solusek Ro) Right now, I am enjoying my<br/>
bard most of all.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you fighting right now?<br/>
Do you have a magical weapon? At your level, I would be saving up to buy<br/>
a combine weapon, if you don&#39;t. Soon you can start taking out wisps. And,<br/>
by killing them, make money MUCH quicker.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s primary is a level 50 bard. She STILL doesn&#39;t regret being<br/>
a bard and is having a load of fun. If I had things to do over, a part<br/>
of me thinks I would have started originally as a bard, not a druid.<br/>
