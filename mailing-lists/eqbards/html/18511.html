ok, so do we know if the rune effect of nillipus&#39; march is melee or spell<br/>
damage (or either), and whether it does in fact drop as soon as the damage<br/>
surpasses the rune, one hit in the case of most mobs?  i haven&#39;t even tried<br/>
it since the 55 bard friend of mine said when he got it that it dropped as<br/>
soon as you were hit.<br/>
