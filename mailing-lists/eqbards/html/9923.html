&gt; An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing wood-elf males out<br/>
&gt; there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>
&gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>
&gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose<br/>
&gt; tinged<br/>
&gt; silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
&gt; examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf<br/>
&gt; females<br/>
&gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>
&gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is<br/>
&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
