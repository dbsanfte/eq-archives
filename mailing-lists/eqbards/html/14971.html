<b>Subject:</b> Boots, time, and mana song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-508094957">Hmmm, a nice lady in my guild did the Watchman boot quest and said they were black<br/>
plate, then a person here said they look like silver plate.  I guess the best<br/>
confirmation is my own eyes =).<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, given that the Watchman boot quest has to be started on a<br/>
particular day/time in game, I need to remind myself of the conversion from Earth to<br/>
Norrathian time.  Last time I payed a lot of attention was trying to predict the<br/>
time of sunrise in North Karana so as to schedule a wedding =).  Notice that Norrath<br/>
doesn&#39;t rotate on its axis hehe.<br/>
<br/>
I looked around for information on charred boots and was kind of surprised not to<br/>
find any.  I would guess they drop in Sol A based on the name and the increase to<br/>
fire reist.  Could someone help me out here please?<br/>
<br/>
Regarding mana song: have we chatted about its effect on casting cost?  Anyone done<br/>
tests?<br/>
