The shard is dropped by the Kobold Predator in Solusek A. It&#39;s hard to <br/>
describe where he is located, but I can tell you he roams a short corridor <br/>
above the Foreman&#39;s room. There is a goblin placeholder there most of the <br/>
time. The corridor has a door that leads to a room with stairs. Down the <br/>
stairs and back around to the right leads to the Foreman&#39;s room.<br/>
