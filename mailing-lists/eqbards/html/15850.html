<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184544393">Well, just thought I&#39;d take a moment and give you all a quick follow up on<br/>
the theft of Tani&#39;s armor.  Thanks again for all your support in this.  <br/>
 <br/>
Basically, the GMs did nothing.  I was asked to write the head GM on our<br/>
server an email to which she has not yet responded (been 5 days).  I have<br/>
pretty much given up hope that they will take any action at all.  While the<br/>
theft of the items was the direct result of a poor decision on my part, the<br/>
lore bag of items poofing was a bug and I&#39;m a little disappointed that I<br/>
have not even received a response from the GMs.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I had Halana camp for the items again, got most of them.  Then a<br/>
friend decided he wasn&#39;t going to play his twinked bard anymore and gave me<br/>
most of his lambent items.    All I need to replace now are an offhand<br/>
weapon, shoulder, back and sleeve items.  <br/>
 <br/>
Soooooo... if there are any young bards on Sol Ro who would like a piece or<br/>
two of lambent (sleeves, gloves and legs I believe), drop me an email or<br/>
send me a tell in game cuz i have extras :)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again for all your support!<br/>
