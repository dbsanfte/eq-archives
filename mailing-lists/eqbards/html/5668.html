<div id="ygrps-yiv-336206606"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;LOL no it doesn&#39;t start with a J.  but you seemed to want <br/>
&gt;an opinion from someone higher from how i read it, and you <br/>
&gt;just seem stubborn =P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  aye, stubborn indeeed. =P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so what i am trying to get across is that i felt exactly the <br/>
&gt;same as you. hopefully you will see there is another perspective, <br/>
&gt;and maybe it is better and you will learn more you encounter it <br/>
&gt;more often.  i think that&#39;s all we are trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i would love to concentrate on pixie/charm/anthem during battle<br/>
  instead of worrying about who to chain, which mobs are about to<br/>
  run and just leave it all to the druid/ranger.  I have had too<br/>
  many bad experiences I suppose with people not doing snares.<br/>
  <br/>
  the comment that amounted to:  If you dont play nice, no one<br/>
  will group with you... was uncalled for.  I&#39;m more or less<br/>
  irritated at that more than whos job it is to snare.  I never<br/>
  have any runners, so my groups never had any problems.  I always<br/>
  find groups who need me =)   (in response to the post earlier)<br/>
