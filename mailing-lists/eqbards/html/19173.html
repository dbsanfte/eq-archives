		Few tips:<br/>
<br/>
		1)  Do not group with him<br/>
		2)  Charm him and make him attack his pet (he can&#39;t cast<br/>
spells at all, pet<br/>
		may even kill him before charm wears off)<br/>
		3)  Rinse and repeat<br/>
<br/>
		Then for variety, run off with his pet in hot pursuit, chain<br/>
pet then run<br/>
		back.  Pet will get lost because it&#39;s so far away from him.<br/>
Kill him when<br/>
		you get back, he can&#39;t make a new pet so he&#39;s even more<br/>
helpless than a<br/>
		wizzie.  When he dies pet goes poof.<br/>

		&gt; I have dueled a mage once before.  I lost, but I learned<br/>
something.<br/>
		&gt; 1)  You can&#39;t charm the pet.  2)  You can&#39;t charm people<br/>
you are<br/>
		&gt; grouped with.<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; There was a bug where I tried charming the pet and it<br/>
didn&#39;t work.<br/>
		&gt; But once he killed me, his pet went berserk and attacked<br/>
him... he<br/>
		&gt; almost died.  I say, get him back for your guild mates.<br/>
Charm HIM<br/>
		&gt; into attacking his pet.  Let his pet kill him and he will<br/>
lose exp<br/>
		&gt; ;)  He will love that!<br/>

		&gt; &gt; A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>

		&gt; &gt; defeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; Anyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>
		&gt; &gt; challenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>
		&gt; &gt; gets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; I have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>
		&gt; &gt; make friends aspect of this game.<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; So far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>
		&gt; &gt; and elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>
		&gt; &gt; are a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>
		&gt; &gt; silvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>
		&gt; &gt; caster....)<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
