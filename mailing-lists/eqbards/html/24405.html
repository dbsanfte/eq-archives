<div id="ygrps-yiv-439071430">We get a new song at every level. Certain levels get two songs. At 27 your<br/>
life as a bard will completely change. No more annoying KSers. And you will<br/>
come to learn what few bards realize we can do. Charm Kite. This is<br/>
basically the strategy of charming MOB A to attack MOB B, repeat until they<br/>
both get down in health, recharm the one with the most health to finish the<br/>
other and then get xp for the kill. Repeat over and over again till you get<br/>
tired of soloing and raking in a nasty amount of XP. You could also try<br/>
charming that annoying PKer and send him in to attack a mid level NPC (ie<br/>
guards are always fun). That should wittle him down a bit.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO bards basically fill in where needed. We are the cement that holds it<br/>
all together. Healing and restoring mana where needed. Buffing at times.<br/>
Cham taunting mobs off casters. Intermitent crowd control. Use your<br/>
imagination because bards will basically fill in any hole in a party.<br/>

  Subject: [eqbards] Hello, new bard (level 3) and well met to all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Right now I&#39;m around in Qeynos Hills (on the Tallos Zek server) trying to<br/>
  stay away from the annoying PKers..(doesn&#39;t anyone ROLEPLAY??, I mean a<br/>
  paladin running around killing everyone he sees??)<br/>
<br/>
  And I was wondering if anyone has any tips for helpful quests.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  already found the copper one, that pretty much got me to second<br/>
  level...lotsa running though. : )<br/>
<br/>
  What are Bards best suited for as they gain levels?  My combat isn&#39;t too<br/>
  bad..maybe like a Rogue?  And the songs are just too cool...I love<br/>
  wandering around with a spell up all the time...whichever I choose.<br/>
<br/>
  Do we also get songs at every level?<br/>
