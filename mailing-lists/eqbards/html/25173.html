<div id="ygrps-yiv-748528043">Wow!  You remember that far back!  Well, eventually I decided that bards<br/>
pretty much suck using swords so I try to play my bard with instruments as<br/>
much as possible.  Granted, having a Selo&#39;s drum and the 3 chants does<br/>
affect your perspective on what  is the best way to apply damage. And<br/>
certain targets resist fire or cold more that others - so it&#39;s real easy to<br/>
lose a third of your power.  But for the most part, I am an instrument bard.<br/>
I might start working on my epic again (gave my scales away to other bards<br/>
in my old guild) since even though it is a sword, it is an instrument too.<br/>
Like a musical sword, yeah right, keep telling myself that.  Grrr, Verant.<br/>
But at least I *look* like a bard!<br/>
