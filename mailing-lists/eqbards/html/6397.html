<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520190164">My thought was that ADM would prevent weapons from proc&#39;ing on your group<br/>
members when sung.  The song references that I&#39;ve found on the &#39;net say that<br/>
ADM &quot;cancels magic&quot;, etc., but no one has been able to prove that it actually<br/>
does such.  Since GZ has said that very few of our songs are left unfinished<br/>
(and I would expect those to be higher level ones), I was trying to come up<br/>
with a reasonable untested use for a song with the title &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it un-Charms other group members?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The title of the tune though is &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.  This implies to me that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; removes magical enchantment from *items*.  Since it is unlikely to remove<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; MAGIC status of a weapon altogether, perhaps it removes &quot;procs&quot; that a<br/>
weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; might have.  Has anyone gone into an Arena, run ADM and seen if procing<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons didn&#39;t proc on you?  Maybe a Staff of Writhing and a PGT against<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; and ADM?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That would be very bad since the song only affects your party<br/>
&gt; members.  :-)<br/>
