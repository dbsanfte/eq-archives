&gt; &gt;Well, &quot;mob&quot; is technically more accurate.  It refers to any<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; True and true.  It is a leftover from the origin of this game in deep MUD.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The true awkwardness here comes from game and program thinking rather than<br/>
&gt; fantasy world thinking.  If you think in terms of game and program there<br/>
&gt; are beings you can&#39;t kill, PCs, and beings you can (more or less), NPCs.<br/>
&gt; But that&#39;s a game artifact that impinges deeply on the fantasy world (for<br/>
&gt; those of us not player killers).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In live roleplaying or electronic I find it deeply disturbing to metagame<br/>
&gt; and treat other beings very differently because I know they are PCs or<br/>
&gt; NPCs.  I thus believe it is best to limit making that distinction to those<br/>
&gt; situations where you are talking about the game and not living the fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you.  I try to use the terms &quot;monster&quot; or<br/>
&quot;merchant&quot; in the game instead of &quot;mobs.&quot;  My ideal for a<br/>
MMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game :-) is<br/>
one where the server does not know the difference between PCs<br/>
and mobs - i.e. monsters use the same rules as the PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, none of the MMORPGs I&#39;ve seen (and almost none<br/>
of the CRPGS) do this.  It is just much easier for designers<br/>
to tweak the game for balance if you can adjust monsters<br/>
without adjusting players in the process, and vice versa.  So<br/>
while the terminology may be disturbing to your suspension of<br/>
disbelief, the entire game engine is built upon the PC and mob<br/>
dichotomy.  Sometimes you just have to use terms like &quot;mob&quot; to<br/>
accurately describe the things that go on in the fantasy<br/>
world.<br/>
