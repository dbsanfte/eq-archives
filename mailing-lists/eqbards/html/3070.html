<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094787595">Personally I switch between the evil term (twisting) and calling it my play <br/>
list :)  Now if someone would just give me some payola to put unpopular <br/>
songs in the list, haha.<br/>

PS for those that do not know, payola was a form of &#39;compensation&#39; give to <br/>
powerful/popular disk jockies in the 50&#39;s to place new songs into their <br/>
stations playlists.  It was quite illeagal.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Also, this is off-topic to this thread, but in response to someone who <br/>
&gt;felt<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;twisting&#39; (BTW, 10 free brownie points if you can point me to the person<br/>
&gt; &gt;that coined that term...and an evil and painful death for him..I really<br/>
&gt; &gt;dislike it) was an exploit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ehehe.  Juggling always had more charm.  Twisting seems to be the term used<br/>
&gt;here, but actually in-game people seem to use the word, &quot;stacking,&quot; from my<br/>
&gt;experiences (ie. I stacked Accelerando and Hymn as we outran the werewolf).<br/>
&gt;Maybe we should all put our heads together and come up with a better term<br/>
&gt;for this!  Then we all agree to use it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I say Orchestrated!  Yes, I am creating my own symphony... nah too long.<br/>
&gt;How about Jam?  As in, &quot;Jam Anthem and Purity on this one.&quot;  Ah, then I <br/>
&gt;feel<br/>
&gt;like a gargage band guitarist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah well, it&#39;ll always be twisting probably.<br/>
