<div id="ygrps-yiv-103153508">Ted, However, IS NOT a true bard (in the EQ sense), as he has a well known GM lvl<br/>
archery skill.  Mr. Nugent must be the uniquely rare bard/ranger hybrid.  While I<br/>
might wish for even a capped archery skill and I am quite sure many rangers would<br/>
love to have a back-up firearm skill for their archery.... I happy to not have his<br/>
negative hits with the Ultra-Liberal, PETA, Elevator Music and Anti-Gun Factions.<br/>
<br/>
PS. Saw him play in Aug. The MCMM (Motor City MadMan) is still deadly with the axe.<br/>
(Didn&#39;t get a chance to examine his equip for whatever gave him the STA +&#39;s)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;      Maybe not Aerosmith but I was at a Ted Nugent concert where he set his<br/>
&gt;      Guitar against an amp in full feedback mode and left the stage with<br/>
&gt;      the Sound system screaming full bore.  A perfect example of a DOT<br/>
&gt;      song...  I fled to the Lobby till he cam to his senses.  As for bosses<br/>
&gt;      casting spells, anyone ever been to one of Steve Jobs little media<br/>
&gt;      events... </span></blockquote></div>
