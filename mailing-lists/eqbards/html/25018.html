<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884432079">There are still a few &quot;quirks&quot; (note: not necessarily bugs) that could be<br/>
getting worked out of the bards.  I am not talking class balance issues<br/>
here.  If you can think of any quirks, annoying or otherwise, add them in<br/>
to the list.  Then head to the quality assurance message board (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro</a> ) and let<br/>
Ester know.  If enough people post to her, she may make a statement about<br/>
it and hopefully fix it.<br/>
<br/>
1) Many months ago Ester told us that the caster animation that bards make<br/>
when using the chants would be fixed.  Nothing has been done.<br/>
2) The sound effects on Shield of song is annoying to most people.  Can&#39;t<br/>
we get rid of this?<br/>
3) There is no text message for Shield of Song.<br/>
4) Though not directly bard related it is a bit.  Around the time of the<br/>
DX7 patch the off/low/med/high particle effect settings became broken.  Off<br/>
now displays what low used to be.  The &quot;new&quot; low is no different from<br/>
medium and high.  I bumped a post about this nearly six months ago.  Ester<br/>
said they would look in to it.  Nothing has been done.</div>
