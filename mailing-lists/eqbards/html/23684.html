&gt; <br/>
&gt; Agreed - the funniest thing about the haste issue - is most <br/>
&gt; are convinced<br/>
&gt; they stacked at one time (When did they nerf this?)  I <br/>
&gt; usually tell them<br/>
&gt; (probably correctly - but if not at least they save face) <br/>
&gt; that they are<br/>
&gt; mixed up with the fact bard haste stacks with haste items <br/>
&gt; -not other classes<br/>
&gt; haste spells.  Some still insist its true - even to the point <br/>
&gt; of - when I<br/>
&gt; sing it to show them they say &quot;See I&#39;m faster now&quot;...  (The funniest<br/>
&gt; incident - I was arguing a tank about this - and he shouts to <br/>
&gt; zone &quot;Does<br/>
&gt; Bard Haste stack with Shaman?&quot; and then some Uber 60 Tank <br/>
&gt; from some Uber<br/>
&gt; Guild says no - and this guy acted like it was the word of God...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway - I agree tone has a lot to do with it.  I have no <br/>
&gt; problems at all<br/>
&gt; with people ASKING me to play certain songs (particularly <br/>
&gt; when I first join<br/>
&gt; the group and am setting up - not in the middle of combat).  <br/>
&gt; Even in the<br/>
&gt; case when they ask for a haste song when a Shaman is singing haste<br/>
&gt; (mistakenly believing it stacks) - if they ask me nice enough - fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What annoys me the most is people who say &quot;Just sing Mana&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; Anyone who has<br/>
&gt; done the research (ie read the testing on eqsongs.com or tested<br/>
&gt; themselves) - knows that barring missed notes - the mana <br/>
&gt; recovery of &quot;just<br/>
&gt; singing mana&quot; and twisting one other song is identical.  You <br/>
&gt; might as well<br/>
&gt; tell tanks to toggle of attack every other tick...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not exclusive, but bards definitly suffer from this the most. <br/>
&gt;  I have no<br/>
&gt; idea why all thse people assume they know how to play my 51 <br/>
&gt; bard better than<br/>
&gt; I do.  I guess they all play lvl 60 bards as their primaries. <br/>
&gt;  I still run<br/>
&gt; into to people that insist my normal haste songs (not the <br/>
&gt; Ervaj ones) stack<br/>
&gt; haste effects with enchanters.  &quot;DEWD!!! I tested it MYSELF!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I am in a group where I am lacking any realy good songs to <br/>
&gt; play, I will<br/>
&gt; offer to play mana song full time.  Usually this would <br/>
&gt; involve having a<br/>
&gt; chanter/shaman and cleric (maybe 2 of the three along with another int<br/>
&gt; caster).  It gives me a break from weaving, which is nice.  However I<br/>
&gt; explain to them thsat they need to med close to the fights <br/>
&gt; (thus must pull<br/>
&gt; close to the medders).  USually they ignore me, so I go back <br/>
&gt; to singing<br/>
&gt; other songs (since mana song ain&#39;t hitting the caters anyway).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When someone tells me what songs to play, I ignore the first <br/>
&gt; time they say<br/>
&gt; it.  Then say, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;, the second time.  If <br/>
&gt; they continue,<br/>
&gt; it is dependent on my mood.  I will usually just go back to <br/>
&gt; ignoring them,<br/>
&gt; but occasionally I will go on a rant about how I don&#39;t tell them what<br/>
&gt; weapons to wield, skills to use, spells to cast, etc...  It <br/>
&gt; also depends on<br/>
&gt; their &quot;tone&quot;  If they are trying to be helpful, I will merely <br/>
&gt; explain whY i<br/>
&gt; am playing what songs I am singing.  Occasionally someone <br/>
&gt; actually makes a<br/>
&gt; good suggestion, and I will swtich my melody...<br/>
