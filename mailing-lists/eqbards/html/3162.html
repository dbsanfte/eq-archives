mob has you, if you aren&#39;t constantly navigating with the mouse. Like most<br/>
folks, I&#39;m right-handed, trying to find things with your left hand on the<br/>
RIGHT side of your keyboard isn&#39;t the easiest thing to do, especially when<br/>
running for your life. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not much easier for left handers.  My right hand manages the<br/>
directional keys ok...but they didn&#39;t manage to program in a simple switch<br/>
for a left handed mouse, so I have to use all the mouse clicks backwards.<br/>
