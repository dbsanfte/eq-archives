<div id="ygrps-yiv-129092710">Yeah right.  The high level bard in S Karana is always camped because his AI<br/>
is so bad he is pathetic.  I watched him being killed by two Necros and he<br/>
never once actually played a song.  I&#39;m beginning to wonder if he even is a<br/>
bard, though judging from his melee incompetence he must be.<br/>

&gt; They design dungeons and populate them with these mobs: knights, warriors,<br/>
&gt; shamen, wizards, enchanters, etc.  so where do they put the bards?  Hello<br/>
