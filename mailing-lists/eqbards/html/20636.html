<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991827561">Hehe.  When smithing, I always played an instrument song, plus begged whenever the icon cleared up (that&#39;s<br/>
one LONG recycle time for a skill that&#39;s never got me more than 1sp).  When begging, be prepared to RUN,<br/>
though.  Standing next to Puntar Sandfisher also lets you play instruments, fish, swim, beg, forage and<br/>
bump sense heading (if you can stand swapping instruments and fishing poles).  He&#39;s a weenie.<br/>

relieve the boredom of camping.)<br/>

&gt; doing something similar in real life.  :)<br/>
