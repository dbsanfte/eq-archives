<div id="ygrps-yiv-760838470">however, even though our skill caps remain, as of a recent patch a couple<br/>
weeks ago, i very rarely miss notes on the high level songs now.  not sure<br/>
how they went about fixing that but it is definitely fixed.  i had much too<br/>
difficult a time twisting verses of victory with anything from all the<br/>
missed notes, which i no longer have.  but just the increase in<br/>
effectiveness of our songs, as pure casters and priests increase their<br/>
effectiveness of spells all the way to level 50, seems appropriate.  as is<br/>
said though, i can see how if they considered us hybrids, that our casting<br/>
abilities like the other hybrids should cap at 200.  it would be nice,<br/>
considering our primary attributes are our songs over melee (unlike SHD,<br/>
RNG, PAL) that our caps would be in line with the pure casters and priests,<br/>
whose primary attributes are their spells.<br/>

&gt; I was particularly annoyed at this too, and, I think it&#39;s the main<br/>
&gt; reason we miss so many notes on our 40+ songs.  I have a feeling the<br/>
&gt; code tests against Level x 5 + 5 for the skill check and doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; allowances for the skill cap. It seems the logical explanation for why<br/>
&gt; our 40+ songs are so hard to start. </span></blockquote></div>
