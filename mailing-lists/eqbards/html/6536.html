&gt; Bard Hate (since toned down but still there)<br/>
&gt; In order to keep casters such as clerics from existing in<br/>
&gt;impunity during group combat, AI was given a &quot;threat indicator&quot;<br/>
&gt;however someone decided the bards ability to assist a group<br/>
&gt;and effect AE but Bards to the top of the kill them now group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Heh, I had an extreme case of bard hate yesterday when logged<br/>
on for just a few minutes. I was down at the aviak tree, just logging<br/>
on for a few minutes. Well, saw this magician battling a centaur<br/>
something, blue to me at 28th. Had my Selo up.. I am 100% certain<br/>
I did NOTHING to attack the centaur. But lo and behold, suddenly<br/>
it decides to attack me! And heck, the earth elemental was STILL<br/>
pounding on it. The centaur galloped few steps towards me,  I was<br/>
mystified, thinking maybe it was feared. The elemental used its<br/>
spell on it, and it turned back to the elemental for a second. Then<br/>
again, it took few steps towards me. It was truly weird...<br/>
<br/>
  It ended up with the centaur turning on me, went for a small run<br/>
with hymn/selo (had just jumped off aviak tree top platform ;),<br/>
and then I started to sing it down. The damn bugger was 27th<br/>
level, hitting for 58. Good thing there were these couple of<br/>
helpful fellows that helped me with the last pixels of the centaurs<br/>
and mine health =P I think I went down to 2pixels before they<br/>
got out of meditate ;)<br/>
<br/>
  And no, centaurs are not aggressive to me =)<br/>
