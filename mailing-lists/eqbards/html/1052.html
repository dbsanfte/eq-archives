<div id="ygrps-yiv-35365752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well 2 songs is one thing, but I used to stack 3 songs sometimes.<br/>
&gt; Well, some bards do it, but I don&#39;t normally stack or twist Hymn of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Restoration during combat. Usually I&#39;ll stack something that has an<br/>
&gt; on-going <br/>
&gt; effect like Whistling Warsong and Anthem (both of those effects are<br/>
&gt; on-going <br/>
&gt; as long as the icon is there). You get a pretty nice boost to stats<br/>
&gt; while <br/>
&gt; they are both there. Try stacking them and check your stats. I also<br/>
&gt; threw in <br/>
&gt; that song that lowers mob attack speed (i like that one)..I think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s level <br/>
&gt; 21 song? Don&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, the Restoraton song does continue after you stop singing<br/>
it, so by twisting it into your combat as say 1 or 3 songs meshed<br/>
together, you&#39;ll be healing for 4 hits per round instead of just 1<br/>
(at 12th and 13th that is).  At lower levels you&#39;d be healing for the<br/>
3 points, and I think it goes higher at upper levels.  I have been<br/>
twisting Anthem, Bellow, and then Restoration together quite<br/>
successfully.<br/>
