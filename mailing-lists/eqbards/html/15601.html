<div id="ygrps-yiv-465699236">Yes, that is pretty normal. You can only imagine the number of /petitions<br/>
that get filed every night.  I get loads of crazy  requests from people.<br/>
Sometimes they start out: what items do you need for Lambent Helm?  Followed<br/>
by: do you have any for sale?  Then: can you come help me get one?  This is<br/>
from people totally out of the blue &lt;no pun intended&gt; and then I go /anon<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;.  &quot;Sorry, I am kinda tied up here with these Fire Giants and cant<br/>
come help you right now....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But any how - keep talking to the guides and GM and be calm and nice but<br/>
persistent.  They can restore you to a point prior to your incident.  There<br/>
is a lot of discretionary room for guides and gm&#39;s.  Keep talking to them<br/>
and eventually you should get some help.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or has some bucks to<br/>
hire one go after these loot item stealers.  Subpoena Verant for the real<br/>
life name of the loot thief and file both criminal charges and civil suit.<br/>
That sot&#39;s local newspapers would have a field day with a story like that.<br/>
The thieves (and/or the farmer&#39;s) have established &quot;real - life&quot; value of<br/>
these items by selling them for cash on e-bay.  &quot;Your honor and esteemed<br/>
members of the jury, I beg your patience in this matter but I must show you<br/>
what grievous mental anguish my client would suffer if she were to have to<br/>
endure another Ykesha camp.  Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>
comfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the items stolen!  OMG!<br/>
Lord with a Sword!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only a matter of time before this will happen.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, be nice but persistent and stay in contact with your guides<br/>
and GM&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; Well, I did report it and was told there was nothing that could be (or<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; be) done about the situation.  However, at the end of the night, the gm<br/>
&gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.<br/>
Hopefully<br/>
&gt; that will help matters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The character who actually stole it was Razel, although he said it was his<br/>
&gt; &quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole the items.  I am told<br/>
&gt; that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken advantage of as well but I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know what to believe. </span></blockquote></div>
