<div id="ygrps-yiv-981703859">Shouldn&#39;t one pulse of our CoD be easily able to KS then?  If pets aren&#39;t<br/>
part of the equation it should be easy to test.  If pets are involved maybe<br/>
it would be easiest to test with a level 3 bard and a level 3 pet class.<br/>
Have the bard CoD it once then step back and let the other caster kill it<br/>
with pet.  To test if its overlapping DoT&#39;s, use a necro who can DoT for<br/>
more than a single cycle of CoD.<br/>

&gt; find/document/prove or is Verant already aware of this?<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re aware of it (many of the players seem to be),<br/>
but haven&#39;t been able to reproduce it.  I really do think it&#39;s<br/>
somehow connected to pets or DoTs.  If I can figure out how to<br/>
reproduce it (difficult since we&#39;re not really a pet/DoT<br/>
class), you can be sure I&#39;ll report it.<br/>
