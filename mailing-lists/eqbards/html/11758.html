<b>Subject:</b> Old topic (and off-topic at that) - That weird &quot;cauldron&quot;... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-592933409">A while back, someone noted that there was a cauldron in Neriak that acted <br/>
like it was locked.  Someone else noted a similar cauldron in <br/>
Crushbone.  Last night, someone in the chat room mentioned a weird crystal <br/>
in Ak&#39;anon that turns and makes a door noise.  I tested this one for <br/>
myself.  Finally, I think I discovered the solution:<br/>
Without going deeply into 3-d realm development, suffice to say that there <br/>
are two basic kinds of &quot;things&quot; in the EQ world - Brushes (walls, floors, <br/>
ceilings - permanent, non-moving pieces of structure) and entities (things <br/>
that move, or have &quot;function&quot; or cause actions).  The primary difference <br/>
between a brush and an entity when building it is the assignment of a <br/>
specific &quot;function&quot; to that entity.  For example, doors might be assigned a <br/>
func_door attribute, to allow them to be opened.  The standard attribute <br/>
that they are assigned will often include other, related things, such as <br/>
sounds or actions that may be performed on such items.<br/>
What I think has happened in all three cases (and I&#39;m sure there are more <br/>
out there, waiting to be found...) was that when the entity was created, it <br/>
was supposed to be assigned a func_cauldron (makes noise or whatever it was <br/>
supposed to do).  But someone assigned it the wrong number (13 instead of <br/>
31) and it ended up becoming a func_locked_door.  With the rotating crystal <br/>
in Ak&#39;anon, it looks like it should have been a func_rotating_crystal, and <br/>
instead is a func_door.<br/>
Anyway - that&#39;s really what it looks like to me.<br/>
