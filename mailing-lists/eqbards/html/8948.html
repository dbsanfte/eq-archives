and a half ago.  Zytl, and the guards in Nektulos are pretty<br/>
much immune to Chain, charm, and fear (at least to me in the<br/>
upper 30s).  Gix and Dorn are slightly less resistant, but<br/>
resist so often that it&#39;s generally a better idea to stick to<br/>
self/party buffs.  About the same time, they also beefed up<br/>
the damage these guys do, or lowered the low-level damage cap.  <br/>
I could easily solo Gix and Dorn at 30, but when the change<br/>
went in I couldn&#39;t solo either of them at 35.<br/>

&gt; Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>
&gt; on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>
&gt; time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>
&gt; reliability than this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dunno about wisps, haven&#39;t killed one in a long time.  They<br/>
did make wisps in Befallen immune to chain/snare/root (or<br/>
practically immune) several months ago, so I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised if they did the same to all wisps.  It would help<br/>
cut down the number of high level players harvesting them.<br/>
<br/>
Once nice change I noticed is that Chain now stops runners if<br/>
they&#39;re below half health, which coincidently is when most<br/>
greens start to run.  If you&#39;ve got an annoying green runner,<br/>
snare (and the old Chain) will not stop it until it&#39;s at about<br/>
25% health.  The only option used to be rooting it.  Now you<br/>
can Chain it.  It also makes Chain/Screech a much easier combo<br/>
to use since your opponent will be immobile half the fight.<br/>
