<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-138186468">Hmmm, sent that before I finished or wasn&#39;t clear or something.  The next<br/>
death at 31 dropped him from two full bubbles down to just a sliver over one<br/>
bubble.  It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped to<br/>
30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>
decorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely appeared<br/>
that he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when he<br/>
dropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when part<br/>
of the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>

&gt; Wow, that&#39;s exactly the opposite of what we saw.  He died when barely 31<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; was down about a quarter bubble in 30.  When he died when barely 30 he<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see any missing xp at 29 and one kill dinged him back to 30.<br/>
<br/>
???  What you describe is exactly what I saw.<br/>
<br/>
He was barely 31 and lost about a quarter bubble into 30 (I&#39;ll<br/>
assume he lost less than me due to class/race differences).  <br/>
That tells you a level 31 death costs (for him) a bit more<br/>
than quarter of a level 30 bubble.<br/>
<br/>
When he died &quot;barely&quot; 30, he lost almost nothing into 29.  <br/>
That tell syou a level 30 death costs (for him) so little of a<br/>
level 30 bubble that he considered himself &quot;barely&quot; into it.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, a level 31 death costs (for him) a quarter level 30<br/>
bubble, while a level 30 death costs a smidgeon of a level 30<br/>
bubble.  So a level 31 death takes away more exp than a level<br/>
30 death, just like I saw.<br/>
