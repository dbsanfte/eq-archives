<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308664598">Where does the Runed Falchion come from, what are its stats, is it wieldable<br/>
in either hand? I use a Crystalline sword 11/38 on melee mobs, and a Claw on<br/>
casters. I have a line on a Silvery Scimitar 6/22, and my off hand weapon is<br/>
almost always a PGT. I may get a Ykesha this weekend if the Lord decides to<br/>
drop one, but I am always looking for high damage short delay options. The<br/>
Writhing staff is interesting, but like the various crystal staffs sort of a<br/>
novelty weapon.<br/>

I&#39;m a lvl 30 Bard on Fennin Ro with the following stats. Str 115, Sta 86,<br/>
Agi 132, Dex 151, Wis 60, Int 79, Cha 90, HP 699, AC 559. Yes I&#39;m a bit<br/>
twinked.. anyhow.  My one hand blunt is maxed, as is my one hand slash, and<br/>
dual weild.  My piercing is only at 60 or so (need to work on that one).<br/>
The following info is when fighting aviak&#39;s and Centaur&#39;s in South Karana. I<br/>
also always have my PGT in my left hand (good for constency for this test).<br/>
I am solo&#39;ng in these tests, with melee and bellow being my primary mode,<br/>
occasionally with the claw I&#39;ll throw in JWW, but not constantly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Writhing:<br/>
<br/>
Heavy weapon, large stamina drain, yes it proc&#39;s, but only 2-3 times a<br/>
battle. I do not notice any higher resist with the -9 cha loss.  Overall, a<br/>
neat looking weapon, but not especially effective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bladed Thulian Claw:<br/>
<br/>
Light, fast, low damage.  The speed is awesome, and it seems to me that my<br/>
dual weild goes off more often with this weapon, which may explain why I do<br/>
better with this than my Staff of Writhing.  Low stamina loss, which is<br/>
important if all of a sudden you have another spawn in front of you before<br/>
you get a chance to rest. Maybe its because the dual weild goes off more<br/>
often, but it also seems that my pgt procs more often when using this<br/>
weapon.  I notice that the battles seem longer, but I usually end up with<br/>
more health, and more stamina at the end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Runed Falcion:<br/>
<br/>
Nice weapon, imho better than the claw.  Slower than the claw but more than<br/>
twice the damage (11 vs. 5) same weight as the claw, but the battles seem to<br/>
be over faster.  Dual weild doesn&#39;t go off as much, my pgt still proc&#39;s<br/>
though (less maybe because its a shorter battle).  Overall a better weapon<br/>
than either the staff, or the claw.  (Note: I am fighting non-casters, the<br/>
claw may be better on casters in order to interupt them)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had focused on boosting my dex, in order to make the staff proc more<br/>
often, but with 151 dex (with no song, or cast buff&#39;s) it really didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to help all that much, a little, but its not like the staff casts its 48p DD<br/>
every other blow or anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a real world test, I used no calculator to figure stats, or<br/>
determine ratio&#39;s etc.. results may vary<br/>
