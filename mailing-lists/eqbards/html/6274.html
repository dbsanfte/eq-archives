&gt; What I don&#39;t understand is WHY if we can duel we can&#39;t be as effective<br/>
&gt; against mobs? It&#39;s something that&#39;s been bugging me lately if we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fight as well as a fighter.. and can&#39;t use our more powerful atk songs<br/>
&gt; for fear of being overrun isn&#39;t there a problem. I&#39;m not saying we<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t useful I know we are I&#39;ve kept more powerful groups alive in<br/>
&gt; hostile areas for months.. but is it just me or are we being TOOO<br/>
&gt; limited in our role options? Can some of you higher ups explain?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems mobs go up in level a lot faster than PC characters, to the<br/>
point where fighting blue mobs in the late 40&#39;s requires 2 to 4 people<br/>
in a group at the best of times. (except things like spectres) A bard<br/>
can chain and fear a Solusek Kobold if all goes well, but that&#39;s really<br/>
a special case, and if it breaks chains and brings back a friend, you&#39;re<br/>
zoning.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at least in my experience, at higher levels our songs aren&#39;t<br/>
really that effective in PvP either. The same duel that started this<br/>
discussion at L45 would likely see the cleric resisting both chain and<br/>
fear often enough to cause the bard extreme problems, especially if the<br/>
cleric was a smart PvP player. Clerics, played well, are extremely<br/>
deadly at PvP, as their flash of light spell is very fast to cast and<br/>
seems to be very difficult to resist. I had an unbuffed resist of 65<br/>
magic resist and he blinded me multiple times. A friend of mine at L35<br/>
beat a L40 warrior in a duel by blinding him, rooting him then blasting<br/>
him. He had to run and hide to med to get enough mana to finish the<br/>
warrior off but was able to do that because the warrior was blinded and<br/>
couldn;t see where he went.<br/>
<br/>
I tried a bunch of tactics at L48 against a friend of mine who was then<br/>
a L45 warrior in the freeport arena and I found that he resisted way too<br/>
much for me to have a lot of confidence in winning if we were seriously<br/>
dueling. And this was _before_ the recent changes that increased<br/>
warrior&#39;s magic resist. He even removed the resist+ items he was wearing<br/>
to see if that helped. I had a charisma of 113 at the time so I don&#39;t<br/>
think you can make our songs much more effective than they were for me<br/>
then. Using a horn for fear increased it&#39;s effectiveness, but the worst<br/>
was the unreliability of chain. (plus the fact that sitting and/or<br/>
jboots break it instantly)<br/>
<br/>
One tactic I had hoped would be effective was using lullaby with CoD and<br/>
the L48 song, but lullaby has no discernable effect on PC chars at all.<br/>
This combo doesn&#39;t even seem to work all that well on mobs, which is<br/>
really too bad as nodding them off while your dots kill them would be a<br/>
nasty way to do them in.<br/>
