<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769695152">Right so those other 19 people will not be inconvenienced then by any bard<br/>
change apparently.  So they also shouldn&#39;t object to bard issues being<br/>
fixed.  Cause if you start to actually say &quot;Should we spend time on fixing<br/>
bard issues?&quot;  you&#39;re right back at having those 14 segments again because<br/>
every one of them will want &quot;their&quot; issues fixed.<br/>

if you&#39;d like to argue that number, go ask 10 random people of various<br/>
classes &#39;&#39;What are bard <br/>
balance issues and what do you think about them?&#39;&#39; and tally up the answers<br/>
you get.  And<br/>
obviously I don&#39;t mean to poll your personal selection of friends whom<br/>
you&#39;ve talked to a lot about<br/>
these issues, heh.<br/>
