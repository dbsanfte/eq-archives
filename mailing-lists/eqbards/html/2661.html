&gt;I am currently at lvl 20.  I do not see the used of lvl 20 song at all and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;was hoping that it does what the song list say it does which is -AC and <br/>
&gt;slow<br/>
&gt;down the attack rate.  I do not see that when I used it against a blue.  It<br/>
&gt;said that it is binding and all.  could anyone tell me if they have ever <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt;any success with this song?  Also I am very close to lvl 21 and I was<br/>
&gt;wondering if I should buy it since I am very short on PP.  The lvl 21 song<br/>
&gt;is supposed to be very similar to lvl 20 right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thnx for the help,<br/>

A quick fight you might as well not bother i think. It&#39;s not a real <br/>
noticeable difference, but then i never thought the attack speedup with <br/>
Anthem was very noticeable either. I kinda liked twisting Melodic binding <br/>
with Anthem cuz I feel that every advantage adds up in a heated fight. I <br/>
have since stopped using it though because I am usually in a dungeon and <br/>
it&#39;s not good for a bard to be tanking all of the mobs that are pulled...<br/>
