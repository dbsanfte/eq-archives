I think part of the problem here is that we grew up KNOWING we could not<br/>
rely on these songs in a party setting, and thus found other ways around<br/>
them.  If we started with the increased range, we might be using them to<br/>
this day.  I&#39;ve used levitation for crossing Lake Rathe... with party<br/>
members dropping in the water and then not being able to be effected by my<br/>
song, it became easier for all to swim, or to get levitation another way.<br/>
Same with Lavastorm.  I&#39;ve used water breathing to get to the cave in<br/>
Everfrost.  Talk about a slow, painful and FEARFUL trip. :)  I knew I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t drown, but we had to go painfully slow to make sure my GF who was<br/>
following me didn&#39;t fall out of range.  And I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve<br/>
outran my GF in a trek across country, having to stop and wait for her to<br/>
get back in range of selo&#39;s... (I wish I could explain THAT one. :)<br/>
<br/>
These enhancements may not seem &quot;all that&quot; for those of us who&#39;ve found<br/>
other ways around them, but for a young bard coming up, hopefully those<br/>
songs become more useful.  Liken it to the Point North spell... Would we<br/>
ever use it?  Not a chance.  Would a new character?  Most certainly.<br/>
