&gt; &gt; Especially when you consider their ability to cast Divine Aura and be<br/>
&gt; &gt; invincible for a brief time.  Sadly enough in my normal group our tanks are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, they can&#39;t cast spells while invulnerable, and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; supposed to have a really long cycle time.  It&#39;s basically a<br/>
&gt; last-ditch get-out-of-death-free tactic, to help them run for<br/>
&gt; the zone.  Once a cleric casts Divine Aura, he is no longer a<br/>
&gt; factor in the fight (other than your party trying to keep him<br/>
&gt; alive).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. He&#39;s a factor in the fight in that he can stand there being<br/>
beaten on for 30 seconds with out taking any damage while everyone else<br/>
in the group can nuke or beat on the mob. Now granted, I have never seen<br/>
anyone use this technique (and if it became popular and well known I<br/>
would be willing to bet Verant would nerf devine aura, assuming it was<br/>
effective) but in a way it makes them the perfect tank for 30 seconds.<br/>
They can soak up huge amounts of damage without actually taking any.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with Bards at later levels, IMO is that most groups<br/>
(at least on our server) go to item distribution based on need, rather<br/>
than the various schemes like alpha used by lower levels. I believe this<br/>
is used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard is known as<br/>
a mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the weapons we<br/>
can use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we have no bard<br/>
only weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>
the item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>
Ykesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>
making as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes eventually your turn will come up, but with the super rare spawn<br/>
stuff, that eventually can be an awfully long time, and at least for<br/>
some of us, like other classes in the game, part of the fun comes from<br/>
having some unique things that make your character special in some way.<br/>
Having no weapons or armor that are unique pretty well leaves Bards out<br/>
in the cold as far as that goes.<br/>
