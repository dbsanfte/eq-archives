<div id="ygrps-yiv-685695405">Heh..that&#39;s cool...and rare.  :/<br/>
<br/>
I think I have a decent lfg shout worked out, now.  I&#39;ll give it a try this<br/>
weekend, and see what kind of response I get.  Maybe now that it&#39;s known<br/>
that there *is* afterall a grouping bonus, no matter how small, finding<br/>
groups should be easier, and get easier once they raise that bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, matter of fact, just last night, I was grouped with a necro guildmate,<br/>
and another necro sends a tell asking to group.  One is rare, two necro&#39;s<br/>
lfg...now that&#39;s just downright odd...  :)  Not complaining, though!  <br/>

Heh heh, that&#39;s good.  I responded to a /shout a few nights ago.  It was<br/>
&quot;Looking for a cleric or an enchanter to round out group, send tells&quot;  I<br/>
responded with &quot;How about a third of each with a third of a tank thrown in<br/>
for good measure? ;-)&quot;  They thought it was funny enough that they took me<br/>
in over the enchanter who responded ;-)<br/>

First, I just wanted to say, it&#39;s wrong to cater to those who would program<br/>
a joypad...besides, the joypad can&#39;t try again if you miss a note.  :)<br/>
Anyway...cater to the rest of us.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Second, I&#39;m creating a LFG social.  A nice big long one that will basically<br/>
be an advertisement of my skills.  Not sure how to word it yet...I&#39;ve<br/>
discarded a few, half formed ideas...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Buffing, healing, mega bard, LFG!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea...heh..that was lame...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back to work now...<br/>

&gt;There is no other class which even remotely approaches the actual physical<br/>
&gt;difficulty of play which the bard class presents.  I don&#39;t think bards are<br/>
&gt;adequately recompensed for that aspect of the playability factor; in fact I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think it even enters into the equation in Verant&#39;s mind because<br/>
&gt;despite their claims to the contrary it is quite evident that no one there<br/>
&gt;plays a bard regularly.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how difficult is it to program a gamepad with a 4 song twist and set it to<br/>
repeat?<br/>
you may not do that, and i may not do that, but people can do it, and fairly<br/>
easily.  should they be recompensed?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think that if all the classes were properly balanced we would see a more<br/>
&gt;balanced representation of the classes in the overall population.  That is<br/>
&gt;not the case.  Certain classes so far outnumber others that it is readily<br/>
&gt;apparent there must be a reason for it.  Certain other classes, including<br/>
&gt;bards, are so vastly underrepresented that there also must be a reason for<br/>
&gt;that.  Personal preference would obviously create some variation, but<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a population as large as this one that variation would not be at the levels<br/>
&gt;we see now.  Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in the off-peak<br/>
&gt;hours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>
&gt;lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically should be fairly<br/>
&gt;equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; factors like druids,<br/>
&gt;shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you should probably try at peak times with the flag &#39;&#39;count&#39;&#39;, i.e. /who all<br/>
cleric count.<br/>
that will give you just the number instead of listing the names of each<br/>
person.<br/>
anon will tend to lower the numbers for certain classes like<br/>
druids/clerics/enchanters<br/>
who are already well represented it seems like.<br/>
<br/>
also, there is a difference between &#39;&#39;perceived&#39;&#39; power and &#39;&#39;actual&#39;&#39;<br/>
power.  there is a lot<br/>
of player ignorance on what a bard can actually do.  that doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily mean the<br/>
actual power needs to be pumped, just the perception.  at level 55 i still<br/>
run across people<br/>
who say &#39;&#39;oh i didn&#39;t know a bard could do that&#39;&#39;.  There also tends to be a<br/>
lot of twinking/PLing<br/>
of the key big raid classes by uberguilds, i.e. warrior, cleric, enchanter,<br/>
wizard.  that will tend to<br/>
skew numbers as well.<br/>
