<div id="ygrps-yiv-817614689">Well, after talking to him I&#39;m not sure the Oracle&#39;s all that innocent, but<br/>
I know what you mean.  Imagine my boredom at finding a whole zone of neutral<br/>
catpeople on Kerra Isle.  Why would I kill any of them?  They don&#39;t talk to<br/>
you though, so there was literally nothing for me to do there.  Now I know<br/>
why I was the only person in the zone when 1000+ people were on the server.<br/>
Guess they don&#39;t even have any cool items to lure people in.<br/>
