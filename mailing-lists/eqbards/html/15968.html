&gt; Hmm, my way of solving this problem when it happens is to<br/>
&gt; simply stop attacking and either stop weaving (if I&#39;ve just<br/>
&gt; taken several hits) or stop singing entirely<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that kept you alive but our solution not only kept me alive but allowed<br/>
me to continue to contribute a small bit of damage and song contributed<br/>
mana.  Our &#39;real tanks&#39; have haste sashes and get augment or Swift Like the<br/>
Wind.  The songs I would not be singing would have been my (personal) swift<br/>
song (warsong or berzerker) and mystical shielding.  The lack of MR is the<br/>
downside - with it we were resisting nicely but without it we took more hits<br/>
was not a killer factor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Been there already.  We (group who&#39;s member got the DT) camp out as soon as<br/>
the first DT hits.  We try pretty hard not to agro the bosses while we are<br/>
clearing.  And our little techniques work pretty good for us.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something we scrupulously avoid.  There is no sense to having the<br/>
bard and the puller in the same group. No bard songs while pulling. No bard<br/>
songs pre-pulling since they are casting invis, etc. There is no benefit to<br/>
it. Not for the way we do things.  If its only 1 group involved, I am<br/>
usually begging to be the puller (and we are fighting blues). &quot;Hey!  Let me<br/>
pull!  I wanna use my Lament song.  I can pull singles. Trust me!&quot;  Followed<br/>
