<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-764905833">Uhh, this means you look at this as a competition, EQ is not a competition.<br/>
<br/>
My bard is lvl 23 - I don&#39;t particularly care if I EVER get her any higher,<br/>
it will come when it comes. Just broke down the other night and put on<br/>
bronze greaves - something I swore I&#39;d never do, still have the banded tho<br/>
- may switch back. <br/>
<br/>
My focus is LIVING in the world - not monster slaying. UO is much better<br/>
for that - play that too, the ONLY reason I am in EQ at all - my husband<br/>
started playing, and it is nice not to get stabbed in the back by a teammate.<br/>
<br/>
I fish, cook, do pottery, brew, tailor, smith, jewelcraft a LOT of things<br/>
other than slay monsters (which frankly, I wish I could skip completely). I<br/>
am just as happy running around harvesting silk and snake eggs - as someone<br/>
that goes and monster bashes.<br/>
<br/>
I spend many an evening at the CB zone with my little horn, just derailing<br/>
trains - that is FUN for me, saving lower level folks - keeping some of the<br/>
trainwrecks I remember from when I was that level from happening is<br/>
ENJOYABLE for me. I also usually chat quite a bit with the lower levels and<br/>
occassionally am even able to pass on some small advice, guess I&#39;m just a<br/>
teacher at heart. In particular, I get a ton of folks (and not necessarily<br/>
real newbies either - 2nd, 3rd characters of higher players) say - gee - I<br/>
didn&#39;t know bards could do that, kewl! Lots of lower level bards have never<br/>
heard of twisting, tons of folks don&#39;t know what the heck lullaby is. Bet<br/>
they remember later tho - when they are grouped with a bard.<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean - well, I&#39;ve played for a LONG time, tons and tons of<br/>
people I&#39;ve interacted with over my career are 50 - I often get approached<br/>
by their 2nd or 3rd characters - Hey...this is so and so, remember me?<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, basing EQ on levels was predestined to cause this problem. That is<br/>
one of the prime things that cause EQ to not be a &#39;virtual world&#39;. In a<br/>
virtual world (vs. a game) - there is no end, you can&#39;t &#39;win&#39;. Someday one<br/>
of these games will wise up and realize that putting the focus on living in<br/>
the world and interaction, and removing the focus from leveling/pt gaining<br/>
will provide a much more immersive and longerlasting environment for it&#39;s<br/>
users.<br/>
<br/>
Being a merchant at heart - of course I&#39;d prefer to buy/trade things rather<br/>
than go bash in some baddies skull directly. There is a whole nother<br/>
subgame to being a REAL merchant, if mechanics support it of course. NO<br/>
DROP is terrible for that, they would be a whole lot better served by<br/>
randomizing the spawn over an area or zone - than artificially saying -<br/>
well, if you pick this item up, you can&#39;t hand it to someone else - huh?<br/>
Breaking up drops over spawn is the only real solution to camping - and NO<br/>
DROP was the bandaid they slapped on that problem. And of course - users<br/>
will always find the most direct route to the cheese. We all know since<br/>
components are nodrop - lowerlevels can get them without fighting, and much<br/>
lower risk simply by being in the right place at the right time - from<br/>
folks camping for xp, not the items. I ask you, what is the difference?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enough rant for one day.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>
&gt;disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not jealousy.  I<br/>
&gt;am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and that I do not,<br/>
&gt;nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>
&gt;Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some lower) that<br/>
&gt;have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>
&gt;feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>
&gt;discouragement at the diminishment of my questing accomplishments because he<br/>
&gt;has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>
&gt;steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>
&gt;made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>
&gt;yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>
&gt;instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As I said in my<br/>
&gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>
&gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>
&gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>
&gt;DROP.<br/>
