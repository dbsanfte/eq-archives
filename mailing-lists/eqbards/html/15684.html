<div id="ygrps-yiv-867106438">We had the same problem here (6 of us play at work, all have SBLive Values)...one of the guys here figured out how to fix most of it.  Go to the Control Panel, then Multimedia.  There should be a group box at the top labled &quot;PlayBack&quot;...click on the Advancded Properties button.  Click on the Performance tab, then check your hardware acelleration.  If the slider bar is all the way to the right (&quot;Full&quot;), then drop it left one notch.  Then click on the OK buttons till everything is closed : )<br/>
<br/>
I did this the other day, and the sounds seem to be working _a lot_ better now.  (BTW....have a SBLive! Value with a Cambridge Soundworks DTT2500 speakers....now only complaint I have is the sub woofer...setting it to what it should normally be at, it works fine...but my mage friend starting summoning stuff and the walls start shaking :).<br/>

I have the exact same problem with my SB live card.  Spells sounds are<br/>
muffled when I stand (and being a dwarf, thats not very impressive) but<br/>
I sit down, and my roomate starts to complain about the racket...<br/>

&gt; Well - they&#39;re still doing weird things with sound.  I know that recently<br/>
&gt; all of my combat sounds started sounding &quot;really far away&quot; - Like they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; happening to someone standing near me, but not to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if I sit down, the sounds are suddenly right??  I guess they have the<br/>
&gt; &quot;center of source&quot; as the center of the model - not the model&#39;s head?<br/>
