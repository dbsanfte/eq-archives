<b>Subject:</b> Splitting Spawns using Lament -  Pumice - Resists <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073230215">We have had some threads regarding Fire Giants and their resistance to certain<br/>
spells and songs.  I cannot remember if we covered all of these questions, and I<br/>
have missed about a week&#39;s worth of posts, so please bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
I split the frenzied room in Lower Guk last night with Lament (to the amazement of<br/>
some group members, by the way, who said the frenzied _always_ comes - go bards!!). <br/>
I am level 48 and the frenzied is only about 45 I think.  I have pulled Sol B king<br/>
area; it is no problem with Lament.<br/>
<br/>
I have not tried to split the Lord room in Lower, although it is quite open and<br/>
would be easy to try.  The King room is a different story.  Seems you would have to<br/>
invis into the room to get into a position to even try.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the group of 4 fire giants in Sol B - I know they cannot be mesmerized.  Is<br/>
lament the same spell type and thus also not applicable?<br/>
<br/>
Another question relating to pulling. John, you have used pumice extensively.  What<br/>
is its range?  I hear it is quite large.  Now that debuffing causes a mob to aggro,<br/>
could you use the pumice as a ranged weapon with which to pull?<br/>
<br/>
Comments and suggestions about pulling higher level areas are welcome 8).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I felt sick to my stomach as I saw the second resist messages flow when I<br/>
tried out Pixie and Lullaby in Lower Guk Frenzied area last night.  They seem<br/>
useless songs now.<br/>
