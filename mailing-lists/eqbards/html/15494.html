 </span></blockquote>heh. I have done a lot (really a whole lot) with events in That Other Game<br/>
(tm) and in order to succeed events have to work /with/ the chaos of online<br/>
populations rather than against them.  Giving out large amounts of<br/>
information in game is a Bad Idea, particularly in EQ with it&#39;s textbox<br/>
format. If anyone were to ask /me/ how to do it to maximize everyones fun<br/>
(*grin* not that anyone would, unless maybe they knew about the Napa/GL/SP<br/>
Tengu and didn&#39;t hate him) they would have all the backstory and buildup<br/>
occur on webpages with message boards for those interested and only have a<br/>
few key events play out in-game. GMs should be able (and have full<br/>
authority) to temporarily mute anyone (while the offender is in the zone and<br/>
only for the duration of the event) and &quot;players&quot; in the story should get a<br/>
different color text.<br/>
Since they are not going to want to run the event simultaniously on all<br/>
servers there could be a quest set up for those who want the event to happen<br/>
on their server, complete the quest and get one more vote for your server to<br/>
have the event. That way you could also generally limit it to folks of the<br/>
right level for the quest.<br/>
At any rate, it&#39;s not a perfect system by a long shot, just an idea, but I<br/>
think it&#39;s better than &quot;GM shows up/kills a bunch of people/spams<br/>
content/deals with jerks/treasure hunt for quest item&quot;.<br/>
