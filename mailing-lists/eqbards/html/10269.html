<b>Subject:</b> RE: Too much EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-818801273">I have never more than nodded while playing EQ, but I still have a funny<br/>
story to relate.  I was playing when I first got lullaby at 15th and<br/>
practicing to see its effects on low level critters.  I was playing Lullaby<br/>
in the are in front of Qeynos and went upstairs to get a drink.  The<br/>
doorbell rang and after talking to my neighbor for 15 minutes I forgot what<br/>
I was doing.  I walked in to the bedroom and turned on the tv to watch<br/>
sci-fi channel.  As I got ready for bed 4 hours later I suddenly realized I<br/>
had never camped.  I ran downstairs to find myself still playing lullaby<br/>
with about 6 or 7 newbies around me killing off the many beetles etc I had<br/>
gathered.  Some of the beetles had been there so long they would not attack<br/>
anyone and when awakened just turned on me for a snap.  I was down about a<br/>
bubble, but still playing away.  One of the newbies, I think his name was<br/>
Jaloshy or some such said he had been sitting there for over 2 hours waiting<br/>
for things to walk in and fall asleep.  His delay on his rusty 2 handed<br/>
sword was so great they would often nod for a while in between blows so it<br/>
helped him quite a bit.<br/>
