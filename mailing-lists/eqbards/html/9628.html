&gt;Well hmm...  Can we hear from some people that DID find the quest items?  <br/>
&gt;Is there anything<br/>
&gt;special you did?  And how long did it take?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks...<br/>

&gt; &gt; if it makes you feel better my buddy camped that room for about 14 hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; straight (what a goof!) i went in there for about 2 hours the other <br/>
&gt;night<br/>
&gt; &gt; with some buddies, we needed the ring from the king and i needed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; boots....   Well to make a long story short, a dozen champs, half a <br/>
&gt;dozen<br/>
&gt; &gt; mages, a few shaman and not a damn king later, we got absolutely <br/>
&gt;nothing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; though i did get a heart for the ranger sleeves.<br/>

the fiery vambraces from champion the second day (after which they seemed to <br/>
drop every other champ that i killed), and the 3rd day i finally got the <br/>
fiery boots from the mage. The King does not drop any quest items we need, <br/>
but he does drop a decent ring (not as good as the fine higher level <br/>
jewelry), and i got 2 sceptres of flame, which my druid is enjoying (gave <br/>
the other away).<br/>
