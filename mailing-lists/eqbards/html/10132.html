<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882824299">Once upon a time Goatanos complied a Song Analysis, detailing each of the <br/>
songs in a bards song book.  Over time the Song Analysis fell more and more <br/>
out of date, due to the dynamic nature of EverQuest. Working with my fellow <br/>

OneList I have updated the Song Analysis.  Stop on by and check it out.<br/>
