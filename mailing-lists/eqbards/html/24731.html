<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197017621">Being as I&#39;ve revived Talies, I took a look at this, and all I can say <br/>
is.... wow ;)<br/>
<br/>
One small thing, however (and this may even be a revelation!)  Apparently <br/>
Bardic Clarity works VERY differently from enchanter clarity.  This is the <br/>
way that they stated it on the Forums:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Absor sez:<br/>
 &gt;Chorus of Clarity is not a buff. Kendrick explained it:<br/>
 &gt;&quot;Chorus of Clarity is not actually a buff. To equate it to a hitpoint <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spell, it&#39;s similar to, say Healing, whereas Soothing is more like <br/>
Regeneration.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;CoC gives the recipients a direct shot of mana every time the bard song <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pulses, unlike Soothing, which is basically a mana regen spell, increasing <br/>
the rate at which you &gt;regain mana.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;See the difference?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So Reed, the 32 song might need adjusting now ;)<br/>

&gt;Great work! This fills in a lot of details from the last version. I&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt;relying on this more than ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And thanks to everyone who helped compile the information for Reed. This<br/>
&gt;is the Bard&#39;s Song Bible.<br/>

&gt;For those who use it, my latest bard song calculator spreadsheet is<br/>
&gt;available.&nbsp; (It&#39;s an Excell spreadsheet that calculates numbers given<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;level and instruments).&nbsp; It should be up at Rokenn&#39;s site<br/>
&gt;shortly(www.eqsongs.com) but until then, you can get it here:<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The main changes are some more sets of numbers have been added, and lots<br/>
&gt;of song to song incompatibilities have been added.&nbsp; See the<br/>
&gt;Documentation sheet for details.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have any comments or modifications (or questions ;), please e-mail<br/>
