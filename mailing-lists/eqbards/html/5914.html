&gt; This thread my be BONKED but I think it&#39;s pertinent to all <br/>
&gt; players, especially<br/>
&gt; bards who drop things through the cracks fairly regularly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you may have read over the past couple of days, my cute <br/>
&gt; little female<br/>
&gt; half-elf bard on Fennin Ro dropped a 700pp pair of Bladed <br/>
&gt; Thulian Claws in a<br/>
&gt; bag during a trade.  They were destroyed before I ever even <br/>
&gt; got to try them<br/>
&gt; on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sent email to the customer service manager at Verant.  I <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t waste the<br/>
&gt; space reproducing it here unless requested to, but I <br/>
&gt; attempted to make it<br/>
&gt; intelligent and constructive but I did color it with my anger <br/>
&gt; and aggrevation<br/>
&gt; at the loss when it occurred.  I asked what the appropriate <br/>
&gt; venue was to air<br/>
&gt; my complaint (i.e. who to send further email to) about this <br/>
&gt; loss for possible<br/>
&gt; restoration, and stated that I agreed with the logic behind <br/>
&gt; LORE.  I then<br/>
&gt; asked what the logic was of having LORE items destroyed when dropped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was his reply to me:<br/>

&gt; Dear Jason,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I assume you purchased a ONE claw? They are lore items so it would be<br/>
&gt; impossible to possess two. I will direct the server GM to <br/>
&gt; return you one<br/>
&gt; claw. In the near future we are changing the code to not <br/>
&gt; destroy lore items<br/>
&gt; when they are dropped. You will see that information on the <br/>
&gt; patch server<br/>
&gt; message when it is ready.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for your distress and inconvenience!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you say HOT DAMN!  It would appear that I&#39;m going to get <br/>
&gt; my Claw restored<br/>
&gt; to me.  I got this email this morning, so it&#39;s unlikely that <br/>
&gt; the Claw is<br/>
&gt; actually restored to me yet but I&#39;ll be checking first thing <br/>
&gt; when I get home<br/>
&gt; tonight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I replied to him briefly saying basically &#39;Many will be <br/>
&gt; relieved when LORE<br/>
&gt; items are not destroyed when dropped.&#39;, and thanking him for <br/>
&gt; his unexpected<br/>
&gt; restoration.<br/>
