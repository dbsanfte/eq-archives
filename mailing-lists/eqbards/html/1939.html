&gt; &gt; Umm, John?  Since J.M. works for Verant and is the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; developer, I think I will go with his explanation over<br/>
&gt; &gt; yours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh I completely agree, most of what he says is spot on.  But<br/>
&gt; this was just plain wrong.  :-)  He was considering only one<br/>
&gt; attribute (weapon speed) when slecting the best weapon to have<br/>
&gt; in your second hand.  While I agree speed is of overriding<br/>
&gt; importance if you&#39;re trying to rapidly increase the dual wield<br/>
&gt; skill, once you have it maxed it&#39;s damage rate you want to<br/>
&gt; maximize.  Damage rate is determined by speed *and* damage, so<br/>
&gt; the rule of &quot;fastest weapon&quot; does not apply any more. </span></blockquote></div>
