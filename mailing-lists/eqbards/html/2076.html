&gt; I do have a question though.  I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>
&gt; druid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>
&gt; shot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>
&gt; all posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>
&gt; of us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>
&gt; spent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>
&gt; attack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>
&gt; just when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>
&gt; running with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>
&gt; using SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have a slow computer?  If your computer can&#39;t keep up<br/>
with the graphics, you will not move until it catches up, net<br/>
result being you run slower.  At L15 I tested accelerando with<br/>
a drum vs. a L30 druid using SoW - I was slowly (very slowly)<br/>
able to catch up.  At L20, I can catch up to someone with SoW<br/>
fairly quickly (I don&#39;t blow by them, but the speed difference<br/>
is obvious).  Sometimes I turn around after passing them and<br/>
wave at them while running backwards.  :-)  I suppose the<br/>
easiest way to test this would be to group with your druid<br/>
friend, make sure she *doesn&#39;t* have SoW on, and see if you<br/>
run at the same speed.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that my run/walk toggle is<br/>
sometimes switched when I zone.  This started a few days ago;<br/>
I&#39;d never experienced it before then.<br/>
