&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ugggg.  Last night was the first time someone actually said <br/>
&gt; to me, &quot;just<br/>
&gt; play mana song&quot;.  I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted <br/>
&gt; but I did.  I<br/>
&gt; told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer <br/>
&gt; to kill the<br/>
&gt; mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in <br/>
&gt; the group, so<br/>
&gt; I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of <br/>
&gt; arguing about<br/>
&gt; it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; <br/>
&gt; enchanter if you<br/>
&gt; want constant mana regen.<br/>
