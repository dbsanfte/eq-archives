<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655559791"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 7) Fix that bug that only I seem to get once in a while where my songs<br/>
&gt;    get stuck on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Had this happen to me the other night.  I finally decided to run for the<br/>
nearest zone to clear it and while I was doing that, I spammed out the<br/>
hotkey I have for Selos and it finally gave me a &#39;missed note&#39; message and<br/>
went back to being normal--just as I hit the zone. Doh!<br/>
<br/>
Next time it happens, I plan on spamming out one of my higher level songs<br/>
(since I get a higher missed note response on them) until it clears<br/>
instead of just trying to zone.<br/>
