&gt;<br/>
&gt;One song I have always thought would be fun is a song with effects similiar <br/>
&gt;to the AD&D spell confusion.  What this spell did was cause a monster to <br/>
&gt;either: frenzy on the nearest player/NPC, frenzy on the nearest NPC, stand <br/>
&gt;around looking confused, wander off and forget about the party, no effect <br/>
&gt;at all.  Not the greatest combat song but it would be great for dispersing <br/>
&gt;trains :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  I had this idea too, though I had forgotten the old AD&D spell.  <br/>
What I was thinking could best be summed up in two words - words that I <br/>
think both explain the effects of and justify the existence of the song:<br/>
<br/>
MOSH PIT!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>
p.s. Angstlich&#39;s Frenzied Frolic?  Jaxon&#39;s Energetic Jam?  Still trying to <br/>
find a good name for it...</div>
