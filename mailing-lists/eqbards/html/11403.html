<div id="ygrps-yiv-677628461"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I noticed yesterday that a lot of you higher level folks have the skull<br/>
&gt; shaped barbute and I am aware of the fact that it drops from the ghoul lord<br/>
&gt; in lower guk.  I was wondering if it is the rare or the common drop and<br/>
&gt; about how much it sells for.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s the booby drop from the ghoul lord.  Usually when you go to<br/>
  fight the ghoul lord, you aren&#39;t after the helm.  So when it appears,<br/>
  it&#39;s like:  Aww man, he dropped the friggin helm, that sucks.  So,<br/>
  to answer the question, the SSB is the common drop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last evening I was on my way out of North Freeport and just as I was about<br/>
&gt; to zone I caught someone auctioning one for 400pp, so I went and grabbed it.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is a good price but I didn&#39;t care much because I was<br/>
&gt; able to turn around and sell my medium steel helm for 333pp so I pretty much<br/>
&gt; broke even on the deal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I dunno even for a guess as to the price of these helmets.<br/>
  For what it does I guess 400pp is reasonable.  Never seen <br/>
  one sold however, nor traded.  I have given 2 away to guild<br/>
  members, and I still have one in the bank.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Crested Helm, <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Very rare drop, you&#39;ll probably see 10 spaulders before the helm.<br/>
  This is a most sought after item, even by higher level people.<br/>
  The Caitliff in MM drops this, but he is an uncommon spawn, with<br/>
  a rare helm drop which equals hours and hours or camping unless<br/>
  you get lucky on the first few shots.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I heard of a L40 full group holding the tower on live side.<br/>
  Anything less than that I think you&#39;d be asking for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Lambent Helm? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  of the two pieces for this, the opaline helm is carried on <br/>
  deepwater goblins.  They are much harder than they look.<br/>
  During Sylly&#39;s event last week, two deepwater goblins were<br/>
  pulled and Sylly, A level 50 cleric, and myself were almost<br/>
  slain.  Nasty critters.  Again, if you happened to loot a<br/>
  helm on the first try when L50s were farting around pulling<br/>
  the DWs, then you got lucky.  We killed 5 that night, and<br/>
  saw no helm.<br/>
<br/>
  Which is easiest -&gt; hardest?  (minus the luck factor)<br/>
<br/>
  Lambent, Crested, Froglok, in that order I think.<br/>
<br/>
  HARDEST:<br/>
  Froglok requires you penetrate a fairly tough dungeon, and <br/>
  engage in a fairly decent fight with the king and guards.<br/>
<br/>
  HARDER:<br/>
  Crested helm, the Caitliff isn&#39;t hard, he&#39;s just hard to get<br/>
  to drop the helm.<br/>
<br/>
  HARD:<br/>
  Lambent helm, practice and patience.  No dungeons, easy zone<br/>
  if things go wrong, most pieces acquirable.<br/>
<br/>
