<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-670278382">Lets hope with the expansion that Verant adds some new bard skills and<br/>
increases the skill caps.  You would think that at a certain point in our<br/>
career, after watching our warrior, paladins, and ranger friends fight all<br/>
the time, that we would have learned some new fighting techniques.  <br/>
<br/>
Bard: &quot;Mr. Ranger, that was cool how you parried that last blow with your<br/>
off-hand weapon.  Can you show me how you did that?&quot;<br/>
Ranger: &quot;Mr. Bard, without a doubt I can show you how to do it, but since<br/>
you are learning late in your career you could never hope to become as good<br/>
with the technique as I am&quot;<br/>
Bard: &quot;Thats not a problem, if I at least learn the basics I&#39;m certain it<br/>
will help me out somewhere down the road.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That clerics are weak at melee is not the point.  The point is<br/>
&gt; that all the classes that have weak defensive skills have<br/>
&gt; options other than meleeing - root/nuke or pet/nuke.  The<br/>
&gt; classes that have to melee have strong defensive skills.  <br/>
&gt; Except us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose we can always kite...<br/>
