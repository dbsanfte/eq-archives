<div id="ygrps-yiv-692630162">Shortly after Kithicor was upgraded in level, I wrote that I didn&#39;t like it for a <br/>
bunch of reasons.  Not very many people here agreed with me (some of them disagreed <br/>
rather disagreeably), so I thought I would give it some time before I responded.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t like it.  It&#39;s a great idea.  It&#39;s the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
My level 11 warrior was killed two times attempting to go from Freeport to Rivervale <br/>
and back, both times while on the wall, both times in mid-afternoon, both times from <br/>
creatures that were not visible to her when they started nuking her.<br/>
<br/>
My expectation at the time Kith was modified, which has proven to be correct, was <br/>
that, once the initial interest wore off, there would not be enough players in <br/>
Kithicor to keep it clear.  Mid Friday evening, there were 30 players there during <br/>
the Kithicor nighttime.  Not enough.<br/>
<br/>
My expectation also was that these very high level monsters (with very large aggro <br/>
radii) would create some big trains at the zone points.  Right again.  Blundered <br/>
into one coming in from WC, blundered into one at HK, blundered into one leaving RV.<br/>
<br/>
I know that it is possible, by taking a MUCH longer route (and a route which is <br/>
still much more dangerous than the route used to be), that one can in theory get to <br/>
High Keep.  But tell me how a low-level gets to Rivervale?  What other city is <br/>
surrounded by such dangerous territory (for the native inhabitants of the city, at <br/>
least)?  I sure would hate to start a Halfling in the current EQ.  Kithicor on one <br/>
side, Runnyeye/Beholder on the other?<br/>
<br/>
How does a tradesperson do the Freeport/Rivervale/High Keep/Qeynos run now?  (S)he <br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but you get the point.  I still can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t do <br/>
something over in Erudin, or upgrade one of the lower-level dungeons.<br/>
