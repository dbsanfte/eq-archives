<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155259843">Actually holding it on Saturday instead of Sunday was brought up.  If it is<br/>
on a Sunday then people outside the US will have to log on in the early AM<br/>
of Monday morning.  Most people would have work that day.  Saturday would<br/>
make sure that it is a weekend for everyone.<br/>
