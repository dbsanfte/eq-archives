<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-215694159">Made 45 last night finally.  Also over the weekend I re-discovered the joys <br/>
of an old song, Lugborious Lament :)  It started in Sol B when I was the <br/>
only tank in a group at the Sol A bug line.  I deciced to give Lament a try <br/>
and it worked better then I remember. Was lulling bats, beetles, LDCs, Nox, <br/>
anything that got in my way :)<br/>
<br/>
Then last night after Vox (which was John&#39;s (tm) first dragon run btw) I <br/>
drummed down to lower guk to help a guildmate get a Ykesha.  As we are <br/>
forming up in the Magi room the Magi makes an appearence and is quickly <br/>
dispatched droping a fine new robe for our wizard.  the hall between the <br/>
Magi and the Lord was fully spawned and the nearest party that was pulling <br/>
from the area was in Frenzied. So we has to break the hall and the room.  We <br/>
recon and see the Lord is up with a guk wizard, a bok and a Ykesha, but our <br/>
cleric loses invis and a wondering frog agros and we have to evac.<br/>
<br/>
So we get back to the Magi and I pull out lute and start pulling the hall <br/>
frogs.  We quickly clear the hall and head to the room.  Now the Bok is <br/>
yellow and the guk wiz is red.  So we med up,  I lull the Bok then the guk. <br/>
Our cleric pulls the lord and eats the HT with an invulnerbility  The Guk <br/>
stays put but the Bok comes.  After a long, long battle we take out the lord <br/>
and the bok only losing one of our 2 clerics. It was great if only lower guk <br/>
could be like that every night :)<br/>
