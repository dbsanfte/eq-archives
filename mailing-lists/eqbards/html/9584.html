<div id="ygrps-yiv-184171696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think you might be missing the point here. Qeynos Hills, which was the<br/>
&gt;other undead spawn area, and Kithicor (to a lesser extent, were mostly for<br/>
&gt;newbies btw 4-7 level.  So said newbie in Qeynos heads for his normal<br/>
&gt;hunting grounds and BAM, Varsoon the undying hits you for 47pts of damage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Varsoon was around when I was a newbie.  He killed me a few times too.  I&#39;m <br/>
glad he&#39;s back, I was pretty upset that I&#39;d never get retribution!<br/>
