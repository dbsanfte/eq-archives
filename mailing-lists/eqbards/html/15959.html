<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414780900">Great info - I&#39;m already using all the types of things that you mentioned,<br/>
but there are some members of my guild who are playing bards and want to<br/>
know how to do what yo have listed - I had thought about making up a page<br/>
like that but now I don&#39;t have to... I can just point them to that page.<br/>
THANKS!!<br/>

&gt; I took screenshots of my hotkey panels for a friend of mine and put them<br/>
&gt; on a simple little page:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I changed my sixth panel, now that I really don&#39;t use charm anymore, I put<br/>
&gt; on it my earring, ring and neck slots, and a general inventory with a<br/>
&gt; backpack containing AC/hp equipment to facilitate switching between that<br/>
&gt; and charisma/dexterity.<br/>
