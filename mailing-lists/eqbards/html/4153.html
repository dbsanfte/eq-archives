 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had friends do the same thing as you.  But I daresay,<br/>
most twinked characters are secondary (or third, or fourth,<br/>
etc) characters made by players who want to build up a<br/>
different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>
the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please don&#39;t automatically associate all the evils of camping rares to<br/>
&gt; twink newbies with simply twinking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The alternative is to ignore the evils.  Rock and hard place.<br/>
Most people choose to shoot the occasional innocent rather<br/>
than let the bad guy get away with it.<br/>
