Luxbane&#39;s (almost level 49 again, heeh) gear:<br/>
<br/>
Crown of King Tranix<br/>
Cape of Midnight Mist<br/>
Guise of the Deceiver<br/>
Fishbone Earring<br/>
Electrum Sapphire earring<br/>
Platinum Fire Emerald Ring<br/>
Gold Star Ruby Ring (or whichever the 7 cha is)<br/>
Lambent Bracer x2<br/>
Crested Spaulders<br/>
Mithril Vambraces<br/>
Mithril Breastplate<br/>
Imbrued Platemail Greaves (woohoo it drops again!)<br/>
Hooded Black Cloak<br/>
Dwarven Work Boots<br/>
Flowing Black Silk Sash<br/>
Short Sword of the Ykesha x2<br/>
Runed Bone Fork<br/>
<br/>
Lute of the Gypsy Princess<br/>
Selo&#39;s Drums of the March<br/>
McVaxius&#39; Horn of War<br/>
Wooden Flute (lol)<br/>
<br/>
I also carry extra junk in my box of abukar:  a Crown of the Froglok Kings, <br/>
2 Opalline Earrings, another star ruby ring, a thick banded belt, and an <br/>
electrum-bladed wakizashi.  Oh, and for Hate sometimes I&#39;ll carry a <br/>
Mistmoore shield for the disease resists and AC boost.  That way I can <br/>
change stats as needed.  As it is in normal gear I have 127 STR 130 DEX and <br/>
130 CHA which is hardly lacking on any of those.  The only one I wish I <br/>
could boost more is AGI which for me is only about 114.<br/>
<br/>
BTW for dragon raids the gear changes in favor of elemental resist + AC <br/>
jewelry, and anything with the specific type of elemental resist I need. <br/>
 Last night in an attempt (sadly failed, only the second or third failed on <br/>
our server) on Nagafen, my magic resist buffed (gear + buff spells + <br/>
elemental and guardian twisted with drum) was 260 or so and my heat resist <br/>
was 220.  I outlived every party member.  I generally survive dragons with <br/>
that gear.  8)  The point there is to dress for endurance not for power.  <br/>
