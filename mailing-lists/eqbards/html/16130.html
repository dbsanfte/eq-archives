<div id="ygrps-yiv-514067367">About that binding song... this is why its a good reason to like read song<br/>
descriptions to find out if they&#39;re AE BEFORE you decide to play them in a<br/>
crowded dungeon or well some place like Mistmoore.<br/>

I wish I had thought to try that.  My four song combo of choice was DDD,<br/>
CoD, Hymn and then a Bellow.  I found it was adequate, but that I would go<br/>
back to the three song combo when things got hairy.  I sadly underutilized<br/>
Hymn (and then Chains) for a long time, until I figured out how potent they<br/>
could be.  (It probably all dates back to that bard who ridiculed me for<br/>
using the all-song combo when I was 22 and she was 28 because she &quot;didn&#39;t<br/>
like it&quot;...her combo of choice was hymn, chains and anthem with weapons.)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, your posts are making me seriously consider making another bard on my<br/>
server (or another one, I don&#39;t care) and working him up to crags again :)<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my beloved ogre warrior is now 19 and desperately seeking<br/>
his surname.  He wouldn&#39;t last very long in EK soloing crags between 22 and<br/>
26 =) (or at least I don&#39;t think he would)<br/>
