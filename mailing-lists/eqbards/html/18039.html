 </span></blockquote>Hmm, what hand do you use for moving?  The reason I ask is that most folks<br/>
(I think, maybe I&#39;m about to be corrected) use their numpad for hotkeys &<br/>
therefore for song weaving.  You want to be able to move around while<br/>
singing, and I would think trying to use direction arrows and the number pad<br/>
together would be awkward.<br/>
