<div id="ygrps-yiv-95317322">Just gotta throw in my opinion here.  If I had waited to find balanced <br/>
groups, I would<br/>
never have gotten to 53.  I have made a considerable portion of my 53 <br/>
levels with just a<br/>
warrior at my side.  We welcome others to group with us without regard for <br/>
class because<br/>
for the most part we don&#39;t need any specific class.  I really get annoyed <br/>
at the &quot;we have<br/>
to have a healer&quot; types.  I am the first to admit that I am a cleric junkie <br/>
but with careful<br/>
planning, (and more careful pulling), our healing songs, and a stack of <br/>
band aids we are usually fine.<br/>
<br/>
While I am posting, I might as well get screamed at for this <br/>
observation.  With any healer<br/>
type other than a cleric, I can heal the party up faster than they can heal <br/>
us and then med<br/>
up enough mana to be ready to go again.   At first I marked it up to a bad <br/>
player but as I have<br/>
partied with more folks, this observation still holds true.  Scream away at <br/>
me, tell me that<br/>
I am crazy.  No worries from me.<br/>

&gt;happens to<br/>
&gt;be around and drag em off to sebilis.  well actually most of the time i <br/>
&gt;just live in<br/>
&gt;sebilis and pick up whoever happens to be hanging around the zonein.  so <br/>
&gt;we usually<br/>
&gt;have at least on hole in the group, sometimes more, heh. </span></blockquote></div>
