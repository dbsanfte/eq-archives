<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095927332">Being a half elf bard, typically, the ones i know tend to be battle bards,<br/>
and therefore go the tank route.  But if you&#39;re like me, and not necessarily<br/>
looking for every single strength item in the game, I would recommend a<br/>
White Gold Necklace (Froglok Noble in LGuk) instead of the +6str the Runed<br/>
Lava Pendant offers. The neck to which i refer is no ac (yukky) but has 7<br/>
cha and +7 f/c/mag... handy on every type of Also an opinion, and it&#39;s what<br/>
i&#39;ve seen on like 1 other bard on the entire server, which happens to, or<br/>
used to, post here.<br/>

Thanks Flew!<br/>
