<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot; <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-239821787">Interestingly enough, much of the Prexus community as a whole has chosen to<br/>
ignore the new &quot;Play Nice&quot; rules and continue with what has worked for our<br/>
server up to this point.  Most high level people and guilds want to continue<br/>
with the &quot;group list&quot; concept in order to manage the number of players at a<br/>
particular spawn point.  Additionally, they are talking about letting &quot;high<br/>
level politics&quot; take care of themselves when it comes to the &quot;whiners&quot;...<br/>
Those people simply would get left out of the larger undertakings such as<br/>
dragon raids and plane incursions.<br/>
<br/>
Will this work?  Depends on how many whiners out there force Verant to take<br/>
action.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that the moment another party shows up in the<br/>
Lords room in Lower Guk after the spawn has been broken and demands to share<br/>
the spawn and Verant enforces their policies you will see a TON of people<br/>
quit the game outright...<br/>
<br/>
For me, this &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy is a GREAT reason to keep my Asheron&#39;s Call<br/>
account active and ready for me to move back to...<br/>
