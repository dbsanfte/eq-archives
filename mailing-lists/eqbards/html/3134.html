&gt; Okay, I&#39;m convinced, songweaving or weaving for short gets my vote.  although<br/>
&gt; I can see humans calling it juggling just to be difficult.  Heh heh.  Notice<br/>
&gt; the human&#39;s don&#39;t really seem to have guilds?  They just hang out in music<br/>
&gt; shops and call it good.  More laid back in some ways, while we woodsies are<br/>

of the fair race.  Although I may admire (and lack) the skill of a juggler, it<br/>
is to me more associated with clowns, where the skills and products of a weaver<br/>
may suit peasant or king, from humble tabard to royal robe or the tapestry that<br/>
adorns a castle wall.<br/>
<br/>
And I must say, in chosing a place to dwell I&#39;ve found fair Kelthin and the<br/>
bardic guild hall more pleasant than the impersonal noise and bustle of<br/>
Freeport.<br/>
