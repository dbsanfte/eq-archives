&gt; Was wondering what happens if you are fighting a spellcasting mob and sing<br/>
&gt; the teleport song?  For example, an ogre shaman is standing in front of you<br/>
&gt; and starts casting a spell.  As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>
&gt; started casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>
&gt; successfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>
&gt; could move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>
&gt; you further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>
&gt; affected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>

walls.<br/>

I don&#39;t think they care about range in the strict way that<br/>
players are constrained by it.  Players get two range checks -<br/>
one when casting the spell, another when the spell fires.  If<br/>
either fails, you get the &quot;not in range&quot; message.  I think<br/>
mobs only get the first check, and if it starts casting a<br/>
spell at you, it will hit you no matter where you are.  I&#39;ve<br/>
run away from casting mobs with Accelerando and a drum in<br/>
outdoor zones.  Sometimes I make a turn which lets them catch<br/>
up enough to get into spellcasting range.  When I see that<br/>
message, I straighten out again, and given the time before the<br/>
spell hits, I must&#39;ve run far out of range.  Yet I&#39;m always<br/>
hit by the spell.<br/>
