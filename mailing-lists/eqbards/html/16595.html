&gt; DOH! I&#39;m allergic to cats!  To quote one of my son&#39;s favorite books... &quot;Go<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  In fact my cat will tackle the rear two speaker stands (Four Point<br/>
  Surround Speakers).  Those little three legged tripods are no<br/>
  match for a kitten, she sweeps out a leg and then chews on the<br/>
  wires.  Side note:  It&#39;s hard to code in the day with bandaids<br/>
  on my fingers from scratches.  Guess she got me back for almost<br/>
  shutting her paw in the door the other day.  It was the worst,<br/>
  bloodcurdling scream I&#39;d ever heard from an animal that small.<br/>
  No damage done, and I even gave her some treats - although she<br/>
  still scratched me up... women.<br/>
