<div id="ygrps-yiv-306137496">There is no freaking way.  I make song sets that either use a single instrument, or are voice-only, and<br/>
use an instrument or weapons depending.  I&#39;ll switch during a fight if I have to go to an alternate subset<br/>
(e..g., I&#39;m switching from resists to charms, or weapons to resists), but otherwise forget it.<br/>
<br/>
In large group efforts, I&#39;m twisting songs as much as 2 song messages ahead, and my mouse cursor is close<br/>
to unusable.  I&#39;ve done swapping in small group efforts where we needed every possible advantage, but it&#39;s<br/>
not sustainable.  I do it less than 1% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I would bet that 95% of all high level bards don&#39;t swap or very rarely swap.  Heck, I had a level 56<br/>
Ranger in my group the other night who said to me &quot;wow, you&#39;re twisting songs!&quot;.  Apparently most of the<br/>
Bards he groups with don&#39;t even sing more than one thing!  So don&#39;t feel pressured to be compulsive about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty much able to keep 4 song effects up now (5 if I use the Breath of Harmony effect as one of<br/>
them).  I&#39;m certain that I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep the rhythm going well enough to use this many if I<br/>
swapped, also.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; main is a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there... &quot;less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking more twisting!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to four songs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW. </span></blockquote></div>
