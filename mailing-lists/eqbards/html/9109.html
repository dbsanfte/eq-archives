<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887889613">I had an absolute blast yesterday fighting spectres and sand giants in the<br/>
Oasis for the first time in my career, but I can also attest to the fact<br/>
that the lag and warping were quite troublesome yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I was chain/fearing an SG while a druid in my group was blasting it and<br/>
suddenly it vanished...poof...10 seconds later out of nowhere, CRUNCH!<br/>
CRUNCH! CRUNCH! I am at 1/4 of one bubble heath as I stagger across the zone<br/>
into South Ro.  Whew!  Those who play with me on E&#39;ci would have recognized<br/>
the all-telling &quot;/em wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of his<br/>
hand&quot; that only appears when I have narrowly escaped having a RL heart<br/>
attack.<br/>
<br/>
I managed to survive the afternoon&#39;s fun and we dropped about 5 or 6 SG&#39;s<br/>
and nearly 2 dozen spectres.  The funniest thing that got me in stitches<br/>
every time was when I ran up on top of a spectre and feared it, then chased<br/>
it around the desert smacking it.  Nothing beats having &quot;death&quot; fleeing in<br/>
terror from you for an ironic laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and since I have written this much and realized that no one probably<br/>
cares, I may as well add that I GOT A LAMBENT STONE!  This adventure in<br/>
Oasis was the most fun I have had in a long time and it was quite satisfying<br/>
to /shout TIMBER! as my first ever SG kill fell at my feet.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday, the lag was incredible.  Constant 15% to 35%, <br/>
&gt; surges and spikes<br/>
&gt; into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some <br/>
&gt; guys getting<br/>
&gt; dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - <br/>
&gt; never seeing a<br/>
&gt; fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping <br/>
&gt; a group do<br/>
&gt; HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, <br/>
&gt; buffing and mana<br/>
&gt; song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and <br/>
&gt; see how he likes<br/>
&gt; it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and <br/>
&gt; charms.  So, I<br/>
&gt; say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you <br/>
&gt; know where the<br/>
&gt; named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea <br/>
&gt; of what is<br/>
&gt; coming next.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I <br/>
&gt; click, it trys,<br/>
&gt; then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is <br/>
&gt; a cant make my<br/>
&gt; songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I <br/>
&gt; look up and go<br/>
&gt; &quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; Followed shortly by<br/>
&gt; &quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  <br/>
&gt; Btw: Kaldivar says<br/>
&gt; &quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and <br/>
&gt; frantically<br/>
&gt; yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>
&gt; glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and <br/>
&gt; desparately trying<br/>
&gt; for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped <br/>
&gt; to the Western<br/>
&gt; Karana.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some <br/>
&gt; lag bug? Selos<br/>
&gt; would not start and since there is no icon and were no other <br/>
&gt; mobs being hit<br/>
&gt; - there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder <br/>
&gt; than that.  I<br/>
&gt; scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not <br/>
&gt; recall seeing &quot;a<br/>
&gt; Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard <br/>
&gt; hate&quot; when stuff<br/>
&gt; that likes you attacks you!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and <br/>
&gt; helped my group<br/>
&gt; kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it <br/>
&gt; seemed almost<br/>
&gt; too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the <br/>
&gt; crowd control.<br/>
&gt; She could park them as necessary while we feared (although <br/>
&gt; not the bard<br/>
&gt; fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  <br/>
&gt; Never thought I<br/>
&gt; would be saying that.<br/>
