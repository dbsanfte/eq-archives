<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706504668">we were accused of the same thing, stealing players.  what actually took<br/>
place was that the people doing the dragons, planes, and gods were a<br/>
collection of players from 4 or 5 different guilds.  it was always the same<br/>
people, but with different guild tags.  for better organization and<br/>
communication a single guild was created, and yes players from these 4 or 5<br/>
different guilds left to join the new guild.  so now we have a single guild<br/>
tag and can talk in guild chat, instead of shout or ooc or auction.  we can<br/>
also organize a raid much faster.  after the 5 main players formed the<br/>
guild, they selected people who they wanted, voted, then asked them if they<br/>
also wanted to join the new guild.   once the guild had its initial base of<br/>
players, new members are now chosen with a similarly selective procedure.<br/>
so in short, the guild was formed not to steal players or make enemies or<br/>
tread over others, but to simply do raids more efficiently, and it works.<br/>

&gt; it was formed. They &quot;stole&quot; players from all the other guilds when<br/>
&gt; they were formed. Good ones. And they have never done anything (as<br/>
&gt; a guild. Individuals within Paradigm are fine. Others are idiots at<br/>
&gt; personal relations) that has made the other guilds want to forgive<br/>
&gt; them. </span></blockquote></div>
