&gt; &gt;That&#39;s possible.  I didn&#39;t check the lag meter, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt;coping with 10%-30% PL most of the time for the last three<br/>
&gt; &gt;weeks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been BAD! Wave after wave of linkdeads, and it is happening to friends<br/>
&gt; with cable modems as well as with my dial up connection. I have been<br/>
&gt; wondering if it was regional (Austin) or further upstream. Sounds like trhe<br/>
&gt; latter<br/>

a code fix could be implemented for it?  I can attribute several deaths to SC<br/>
failing on me at the worst moment.  It would be nice to know from Verant if this is<br/>
supposed to happen or if it is unintentional.<br/>
