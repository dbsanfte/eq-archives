&quot;you are about as much of a tank as t.a.f.k.a.Prince is a bouncer&quot;<br/>
&quot;you have to learn to stop hitting them and let them beat on the others&quot;<br/>
&quot;you have to learn to scrape them onto the real tanks&quot;<br/>
&quot;you have to learn to step out of the melee...it&#39;s called &#39;creative<br/>
chickenology&#39;&quot;<br/>
&quot;GET OUT!!!&quot;<br/>

		I would be the first to humbly agree that dying is greatest<br/>
reason why I<br/>
		cannot level.  Even with Verants change to reduce the amount<br/>
of xp you<br/>
		lose when you die, I still lost 1/3 of  a bubble dying to a<br/>
stupid<br/>
		basement train last night.  At least I got my level, though<br/>
it took at<br/>
		least another to earn it back =(.  Perhaps it is time to be<br/>
less noble<br/>
		and more parts chicken.  It seems that I die more often when<br/>
trying to<br/>
		care people, perhaps it would be better to be known as<br/>
Treilanin the you<br/>
		yellow bellied chicken .... Nah I think not =).<br/>
