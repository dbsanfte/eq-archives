<div id="ygrps-yiv-507730373">Yeah, that has always bugged me.  How come we cannot sneak while invisible?<br/>
What good is Sneak at all if its becomes useless 2 levels after you get it?<br/>
Oh well, just goes back to the theory of bards being thrown together at the<br/>
last minute again I guess.<br/>

&gt; You know now that I think back on it, I remember thinking it was weird at<br/>
&gt; the time because I got the message about becoming visible.  It could have<br/>
&gt; been some sort of glitch graphics-wise and he wasn&#39;t where he appeared to<br/>
&gt; be.  We have used Selo&#39;s in conjunction with Clouding but since we were<br/>
&gt; moving I&#39;m not sure if the other bard playing Selo&#39;s was ever spotted.<br/>
&gt; Everything I conned was indifferent though.<br/>
<br/>
My rogue friend always disbands from me if he needs to do any<br/>
sneaking around because my songs blow his &quot;invisibility.&quot;  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t make him visible, but I think the way it works is that<br/>
while the song is pulsing, the mobs can see you.<br/>
