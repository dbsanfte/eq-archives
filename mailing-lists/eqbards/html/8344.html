&gt; I decided to time my run From Qeynos gates to West<br/>
&gt; freeport through Highpass hold (Invisio on when I passed<br/>
&gt; through there).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My stats: Woodelf bard, Level 22, Hand drum.<br/>
&gt; The time: 31min.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I was at it I also timed how long time it took me to<br/>
&gt; zone (From &quot;loading please wait&quot; until I could move on the<br/>
&gt; other side): 40-60 secs(Dont have the exact times here,<br/>
&gt; but never above 60secs, that much I remember)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  I guess a lot of us were doing this last night.  I<br/>
had 3%-10% packet loss, causing my zone times to fall in the<br/>
30-60 second range (I&#39;m also beginning to suspect the number<br/>
of players in the zone also affect the time).  Nevertheless,<br/>
for a level 36 bard with a Mistmoore drum:<br/>
<br/>
From the West Freeport gate, through Rivervale and Beholder&#39;s<br/>
Maze, to the gates of Qeynos took 25 min 30 sec.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I turned right around and took the Highpass route back.  <br/>
24 min 15 sec:<br/>
<br/>
Among other stats:<br/>
<br/>
West Karana, from zone to zone (excluding zone times) takes<br/>
4 min 30 sec (heading due East/West).<br/>
<br/>
The ramp up to Highpass (from the start of the ramp to the<br/>
zone line at Highpass) in East Karana takes 3 min 12 sec.<br/>
<br/>
Qeynos to Freeport via Highpass is 9 zones.  At an average 45<br/>
seconds to zone, that&#39;s 6 min 45 sec spent zoning.  Total<br/>
&quot;travel&quot; time is thus only 17 min 30 sec.<br/>
<br/>
Freeport to Qeynos via Beholder&#39;s is 12 zones.  At an average<br/>
45 seconds to zone, that&#39;s 9 minutes spent zoning.  Total<br/>
&quot;travel&quot; time is thus only 16 min.  However, this route ends<br/>
up being slower due to the extra zone times, unless you can<br/>
average less than 30 sec per zone (maybe an Athlon 700? :-).<br/>
<br/>
I run at almost exactly twice normal speed, so if you run at<br/>
normal speed, the &quot;travel&quot; times are 35 min via Highpass, 32<br/>
min via Beholder&#39;s.  If you can zone in about 45 seconds, then<br/>
the Beholder&#39;s route is faster at normal running speed by just<br/>
shy of a minute.<br/>
<br/>
I still need to figure out the straight line route from the<br/>
Highpass zone to the West Commonlands zone.  That was<br/>
embarassing getting &quot;lost&quot; in there and having to use the<br/>
walls to find the exit.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
A level 28 bard with a normal drum sent me a /tell asking if I<br/>
was using a Mistmoore drum, since &quot;you blew past me like I was<br/>
standing still.&quot;  Given that a level 22 bard with a normal<br/>
drum takes just 6 minutes longer to make the trip, I think you<br/>
can begin to see how the perceived difference in speed doesn&#39;t<br/>
really add up to much in terms of time saved traveling.<br/>
(That also happens to be true in RL - the guy who blew by you<br/>
on the freeway doing 80 to your 65 is going to get to a<br/>
destination 10 miles away less than 2 minutes ahead of you.)<br/>
