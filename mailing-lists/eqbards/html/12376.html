<b>Subject:</b> Need advice for a trade <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221434829">I am a level 19(well almost) bard on Nameless.  I am wearing just<br/>
about full bronze.  I have a dragoon dirk and a PGT.  I have one<br/>
jagged band, thick leather apron and BS mantle.  one derv ring and two<br/>
onxy earrings.<br/>
<br/>
I was fighting in Runnyeye and a high level druid killed Borxx and<br/>
sold me the Lens for only 30pp!! So, now I have a Staff of the<br/>
Observers.  I would like to trade this for something good like a nice<br/>
weapon, but I am not sure how much it worth or really how much any<br/>
better weapons might be worth.  And advise?</div>
