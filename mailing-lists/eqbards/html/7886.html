<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852687082">Actually I think the quality pelts are all actually skins.  I&#39;ll have to<br/>
check as it never seems to matter.  There appears to only be one type of<br/>
Medium Quality Cat/Bear/Wolf &#39;Whatever&#39; be it skin or pelt and it works fopr<br/>
tailoring.  The other things that tend to confuse people are the<br/>
Ruined/Low/Medium/High Quality Lion skins.  Remember tailoring uses<br/>
Cat/Bear/Wolf in whatever quality/whatever be it pelt or skin.  If it says<br/>
anything else shadow wolf, lion, whatever, it won&#39;t work.  At least not yet.<br/>
those things can be used for quests and poison vials though.<br/>

All these E&#39;ci competitors...=)<br/>
<br/>
I tend to just auction that I&#39;m looking for spider silks and pelts and<br/>
buy them for 2-4gp each depending.  In the Karanas and Everfrost<br/>
(where I&#39;ve been hanging out lately) I can usually get a pretty good<br/>
haul that way, along with killing the occasional fuzzy or spider<br/>
myself.  Another question though, are animal skins worth anything to a<br/>
tailor (skins, not pelts)? <br/>
