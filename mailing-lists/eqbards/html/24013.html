24 then (ultravision song). how about if we compare the ratio of <br/>
human bards with no mask to the total number of bards with the ratio <br/>
of pvp players to non pvp players?<br/>
<br/>
Um, last time I checked, Ultravision (Mask, UV Song) was MUCH better <br/>
than Infravision (Half Elf, Wood Elf), so your comparison is more <br/>
like comparing any bards without a mask to the total number of bards <br/>
with the ratio of pvp players to non pvp players.<br/>
<br/>
Try again. :)</div>
