<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128663268">That just gives them yet another reason to have to group.  Be it for SoW or<br/>
Accelerando.  Verant is all for things that encourage people to group.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that it is anywhere near as big a deal for its negative aspects<br/>
as some have made out.  Yes it is an inconvenience for lower level non-bards<br/>
to travel alone.  Impossible?  No, daytime in Kithicor was terribly safe.<br/>
Nightime for a bard was scary, but exhilirating not death inducing.<br/>
<br/>
Before the change I never saw more than 12 people in Kithicor and I was<br/>
there quite a bit.  The one time I saw 12 was when a group of 6 from a guild<br/>
were passing thru on their way to lavastorm.  They were there maybe 3<br/>
minutes.  Usually it is 6-8 people, 4-6 in the 15-20 range, one cleric<br/>
waiting for an armor item spawn, and a couple of travelers passing thru.  If<br/>
a ranger is that afraid of going thru to get to Surefall they have a safe<br/>
option, take the boat and go to Kelethin.  Or get a low level cleric friend<br/>
to invis them to undead and waltz right thru.  Either way more encouragement<br/>
to group instead of soloing guards whose AI is too stupid to get the other<br/>
guards to assist them.<br/>

&gt; Well, until I learned how - I was pretty scared to travel in evil zones<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; now I do it all the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From arena to freeport - might even be faster thru the evil zones:<br/>
<br/>
I timed it.  It&#39;s about 5 minutes longer for me than the<br/>
Highpass route, which means it&#39;ll be about 10 minutes longer<br/>
for most people.  Try running it without SoW or Accelerando<br/>
some time, and see how not-scared you are.<br/>
