&gt; in reply to a question asked a few days ago...<br/>
&gt; i have sent several messages to the owners of the other bard <br/>
&gt; mailing lists and i am patiently waiting for replys from any <br/>
&gt; of them.  one list i know is dead, the only messages they <br/>
&gt; have had for the past 4 months are mine, and the the other <br/>
&gt; list has just over 100 members many of whom are members here. </span></blockquote></div>
