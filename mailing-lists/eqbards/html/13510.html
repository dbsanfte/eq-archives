&gt; what weapons you Duel Wield. Currently I am using a PGT and Combine<br/>
&gt; Scimitar. The only other character I have is a Cleric so I really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have much experience with melee weaps and though I expect I will be playing<br/>
&gt; instruments most of the time, I was wondering what you all use.  Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions? Thanks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a 28 level Song Bard on SolRo and wield a Enamelled Black Mace in my<br/>
primary hand.<br/>
When I&#39;m out with my friends(rogue, paladin, enchanter, myself) I use a<br/>
gnoll hide lariat in my offhand most of the time or switch to my good<br/>
old dragoon dirk when its getting messy or when I solo/primary tank.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to an obsidian shard we plan to get for me somwhere in<br/>
the next weeks but I think the first one will go to our rogue ;)<br/>
<br/>
Depending on our fights(and songset/tauntfactor)I sometimes switch do<br/>
the lariat and the dirk only but this wont happen so much in the future<br/>
as I have to admit the new paladin change is very useful in our group to<br/>
equal damage taken by everyone (besides the enchanter which we prefer to<br/>
take no hits at all - I use largos melodic binding to taunt mezed on me<br/>
in dungeon settings)<br/>
<br/>
btw: With the new patch I noticed that chains does stack(I guess<br/>
overwrite) largos which is very nice and imho it didn&#39;t before the<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
bye<br/>
