<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765546429">Ok, I am just learning these songs and their highest and best use.  (And<br/>
re-writing tips I have gotten from others - credit where credit is due -<br/>
John Kim and Harmoinc and others.<br/>
<br/>
1.	The rumor is they are linked to your charisma.  Boost it when you<br/>
plan to use these.  Both are Target songs - you need to mouse click or<br/>
otherwise (F8) designate a target.  Many times, you see multi mobs so close<br/>
they are hard to distinguish from each other.  If your tanks are good and<br/>
assisting, you can look for the un-damaged mob and work on him.  But at<br/>
times, it&#39;s mouse click hell.  Once you get one, and you need to switch to<br/>
another, move back a bit so the first one will come towards you and separate<br/>
from the melee.  He will be lots easier to find for the 2nd round of control<br/>
(mezzing prolly.)<br/>
<br/>
2.	Charm will make a _very_ short term pet (compared to other classes<br/>
charmed pets). You can give it the standard pet commands: /pet attack, /pet<br/>
back off, /pet guard me, /pet guard here, /pet sit down, and more.  Make<br/>
some hot keys because you will be hard pressed to type the commands before<br/>
the charm wears off.  Charm is a useful solo tool if you have 2 mobs of<br/>
roughly equal strength (and not too resistant to your charm) - you can make<br/>
them fight each other.  Party members can&#39;t damage charmed mobs (but they<br/>
can waste all of their mana trying - so coordinate.) When the charm wears<br/>
off, the mob attacks you.  You can only have 1 pet at a time.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Pixie will mezmerize the target. Also, fairly short term (compared<br/>
to the enchanter spell.)  Pixie is good for party crowd control.  If your<br/>
tanks are well behaved and smart enough to assist each other (attack the<br/>
same mob), you can keep the 1, 2, or maybe 3 &quot;extra&quot; mobs who are trying to<br/>
join the melee busy (mezzed) while the tanks fight only one active mob.  If<br/>
your tanks are mavericks and switch from mob to mob and attack a mezzed mob<br/>
- it will wake up and fight. When the mez wears off, the mob attacks you.<br/>
You can mez as many as you can target and sing to - although 2 is pretty<br/>
standard, 3 is very good and do-able, I am sure John Kim and Harmonic can do<br/>
more but that&#39;s uber-bard class clicking and twisting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	In the past week or so, John Kim posted a detailed analysis - check<br/>
the archives.<br/>
<br/>
	I might as well mention the 3rd crowd control tool:<br/>
<br/>
4.	Lullaby - this is the Area Effect crowd control song.  It makes mobs<br/>
who do not resist nod their heads and as long as they are not attacked and<br/>
don&#39;t resist, they are effectively out of the fight.  It seem to interrupt<br/>
casters quite well.  Drawbacks are: AE can spill over and agro mobs that<br/>
were not in your melee to begin with.  Mobs can resist and do snap in and<br/>
out taking a nip or two now and then.  A train runs thru your AE and you get<br/>
a free ride - to zone if you can make it!  Lullaby is good for a large crowd<br/>
of low resisters - the target control songs are better choices for bigger<br/>
mobs in more dangerous places.<br/>

the Sirens and<br/>
