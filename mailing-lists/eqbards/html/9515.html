<div id="ygrps-yiv-466383815">Slightly off topic : If even a 10th of what I&#39;ve read about AC can be<br/>
believed, I don&#39;t think Verant will have much to worry about.  Granted, they<br/>
are going to lose some players to AC, but I don&#39;t think it will be as bad as<br/>
the migration from UO to EQ (which I heard was fairly respectable).<br/>

&gt; Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor <br/>
&gt; and Lake Rathe<br/>
&gt; events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes <br/>
&gt; to the zones.<br/>
&gt; Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to <br/>
&gt; do things on<br/>
&gt; live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me <br/>
&gt; Verant has 1.5<br/>
&gt; million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the <br/>
&gt; retail release<br/>
&gt; of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be <br/>
&gt; very aggressive in<br/>
&gt; retaining and growing their current player base.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; envy them having<br/>
&gt; to compete against Microsoft.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope <br/>
&gt; leave it this<br/>
&gt; &gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it <br/>
&gt; stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant <br/>
&gt; KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
