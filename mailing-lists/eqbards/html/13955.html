 </span></blockquote>Ok, now you&#39;re on a slightly different topic - reducing item<br/>
farming, rather than encouraging dungeon crawling.  The ideas<br/>
we came up with to encourage dungeon crawling still work in<br/>
the above scenario - the L50s have to crawl rather than camp.  <br/>
So I would say that these are orthogonal problems that can be<br/>
solved separately.<br/>

&gt; &gt; with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where do you pull to?  If the spawns are random, then suddenly there aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; any safe rooms to fight in or pull to.  Also, have you ever pulled Kobolds<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The special mob spawn locations are random, not necessarily<br/>
the other spawns.  And what&#39;s the problem with not having &quot;any<br/>
safe rooms to fight in or pull to&quot; if you&#39;re trying to<br/>
discourage camping and encourage crawling? :)<br/>
