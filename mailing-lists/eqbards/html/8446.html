<div id="ygrps-yiv-323157908">Hi Im new here. My name is Magnuss from Innourkk. I am just lowly level 8 but I have to say this is the most fun I have had in any class I have played. <br/>
<br/>
The question I have I have heard some rumors about special instruments. Like a drum that is 3 times better then the one from the store. Dose any one have any clue about this? I know when I was in South Karnana with my wizard I found at the top of the avik village a store that was on a small ledge hidden behind a hut. Seed like it was hidden and might have special instruments but I dont remember the names. any ways if you have any info pleas let me know :)</div>
