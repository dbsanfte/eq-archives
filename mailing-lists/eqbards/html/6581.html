<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006473214">last night a level 46 friend joined a gm excursion to fear plane to test how<br/>
hard it was. My friend along with about 30 other players all died trying to<br/>
kill 1 monster. He died 3 times during one single battle.  In other words<br/>
its still suicidal it seems<br/>

&gt; I have never been back since the patch.  Nothing but horror stories on<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; server.  A friend got feared into the gate by Cyndreela and lost 4 bubbles<br/>
&gt; of experience before he got back.  A bard friend had his corpse in the<br/>
&gt; plane<br/>
&gt; for 2 weeks.  Until i see official word that place is off limits to me =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I wanted to know if you and your group(s) have had any <br/>
&gt; &gt; success in PoF since <br/>
&gt; &gt; the update, and if so do you have any tips for us over on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Veeshan. (I just <br/>
&gt; &gt; got 46 recently, and I&#39;m not looking forward to losing it).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are countless 46+ ppl on Veeshan, but everyone is <br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid to go to PoF <br/>
