<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887611511">Here&#39;s an idea:<br/>
<br/>
When being stalked by an unscrupulous 16 year old, get the stalker&#39;s name and log out. Now log back in using your ogre female. Find the stalker and turn the tables on them, i.e. follow them around, make suggestive statements, etc. This will surely frighten them off and give them an idea of how their actions affect others. Don&#39;t push it too far, i.e. harassment, just enough to make your point. You might even role play it a bit to make it fun. <br/>

<br/>
As a male (RL), playing a couple of female characters (aside from being <br/>
fun and amusing) has been educational in an unsettling sort of way.  I <br/>
was soloing a low-level (6 or 7) female human warrior one night, and for <br/>
slightly over an hour, every time I turned around (literally), the same <br/>
male character was following me, hiding behind rocks and trees.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t say anything for about 45 minutes, then started sending suggestive <br/>
tells to me.  I was being stalked!  And, even in the safety of my own <br/>
living room, it felt pretty damned creepy.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about...<br/>
