Since you were able to get a response from Abashi and GZ, you might want to<br/>
send them a reminder for when they fix the percussion aspect of Furfil&#39;s<br/>
Curtailing Chant.  Lets assume after they code the fix equipping a drum will<br/>
now increase the damage of the DOT and the amount of magic resistance the<br/>
mobs loses.  I think we should remind them to remember the MM battle drum<br/>
when they code the fix.  Singing Furfil&#39;s with the MM battle drum equipped<br/>
should increase the DOT and magic resistance amount 20% (I think thats what<br/>
everyone says it increases resist songs by) more than with a normal drum<br/>
equipped.  Based on their track record, if we don&#39;t remind them they will<br/>
probably forget about including the MM battle drum as part of the patch.<br/>

&gt; Hmm - don&#39;t use that one much. I&#39;ll check. If so, we&#39;ll get it fixed right<br/>
