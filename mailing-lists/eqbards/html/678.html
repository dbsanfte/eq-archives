&gt; 7 damage healed per tick.  A tick is 5 seconds.  84 hitpoints per minute.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I agree with you completely.  The rate the healing song<br/>
heals just does not keep up with the rate monsters do damage<br/>
as you advance in levels.  I was just disagreeing with your<br/>
comparison of 60 pts damage vs 11 points healing per tick for<br/>
just one person.  That seemed contrived to show a near worst-<br/>
case scenario under the guise of a best-case.  Best-case you<br/>
have to also take into account your party members healing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most of our fights last 45 seconds or less, so if I sang Hymn full time<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s 54 points damage healed per member.  One hit from the monsters we<br/>
&gt; fight.  Not singing Hymn in lieu of another song, such as Melodic Binding,<br/>
&gt; is much more effective.  With Melodic binding, I probably stop that mob from<br/>
&gt; making half a dozen swings.  Proactive damage avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good way to think of it is to tally up the amount of healing<br/>
you&#39;d get through the duration of the battle.  Compare it to<br/>
the damage you&#39;d avoid by killing the monster faster.  Which<br/>
is greater determines which is the better song for fighting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Another use I found for Lullaby is saving your party when a<br/>
&gt; &gt;hopelessly red train gets dumped on it.  The song *really*<br/>
&gt; &gt;pisses off the monsters, so you fire it up until you have<br/>
&gt; &gt;their attention, then hit accelerando and lead them away from<br/>
&gt; &gt;your party.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good tactic, but not something that can be done indoors, nor even in most<br/>
&gt; outdoor dungeons.  For getaways now, I use the 26th level song, Appalling<br/>
&gt; Screech.  Area fear song, clears a room in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have 11 levels to use my tactic until I get Appalling <br/>
Screech. :-)<br/>
