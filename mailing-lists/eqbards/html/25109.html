the bowels of Ak&#39;Anon.  Sanfyrd Featherhead (formerly Sanfyrd Montop), will <br/>
accept scrap metal (in loads of 4 unstacked at a time), which he will give <br/>
you coins (a few silver or copper) and a random item recovered from the <br/>
scrapyard, which is usually a rusty weapon, small buckler or Gnomish Glow <br/>
Rod (light source for off-hand).  I believe that either 1) there is an <br/>
incredibly small chance for a really nice item, or 2) it was a <br/>
fluke.  Either way, I just won the lottery as far as I&#39;m concerned...<br/>
