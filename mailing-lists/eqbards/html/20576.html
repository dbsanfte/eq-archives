&gt; Kunark except via boat, as a bard, IS there a way?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To me, a shuttle is a boat.  I am also quite reluctent<br/>
to paddle around in the water for 20 min or so,<br/>
checking my loc all the while so that I can attempt<br/>
climbing onto one of those tall shuttles.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have the patience and I am not that brave...there is a<br/>
lvl 50 or thereabouts mob that swims near the teleport<br/>
pots for the evil races....I wasn&#39;t willing to wait<br/>
around to see if it ranges far or has a cousin the<br/>
lives to the North;-)<br/>
