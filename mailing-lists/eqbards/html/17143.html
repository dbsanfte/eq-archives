<div id="ygrps-yiv-699658137">I agree with this 100%.  I&#39;ve never understood why being able to be bound<br/>
anywhere by a caster was taken out during Beta.  When they did it EVERYONE<br/>
complained.  To this day my single biggest bitch about EQ is the fact that<br/>
casters can bind themselves anywhere but can only bind melee classes in<br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
When I ask &quot;Why&quot; even of my friends on the Dev team the only answer I get is<br/>
that &quot;it was the way we wanted it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think it&#39;s extremely lame that Verant takes the attitude that<br/>
&quot;Walking back to the dungeon to get your corpse adds to the realism&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I fail to understand how &quot;Getting to your corpse&quot; can add to realism?<br/>
You&#39;re dead, how on earth do you walk anywhere? ;)  Getting to the DUNGEON<br/>
in the first place is the realism.  Binding there should be allowed (IMHO)<br/>
if you can get a caster to do it.  It was that way for the first 3 phases of<br/>
Beta.  They took out binding anywhere during P3.5.  I remain unconvinced<br/>
that there is any real reason for this and it&#39;s extremely irritating.  The<br/>
_only_ reason they did it was to slow down players ability to level.<br/>
<br/>
Verant has a serious case of US (Verant) vs. THEM (Players).  The fact that<br/>
we leveled faster than expected was distressing to them so rather than<br/>
balance the xp awarded they made us unable to bind near the zones.  Go<br/>
figure.  Verant took the easy way out and thus made melee classes 10x less<br/>
fun to play.<br/>

&gt; Binding has become the poster child for what is wrong with Verant.  95%<br/>
&gt; of the EQ players would be happy/inddiferent to Verant adding some<br/>
&gt; equivalent of Lifestones (yes I&#39;ve been cheating on EQ with AC, viva La<br/>
&gt; Diferance!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The programming would not be hard (an NPC who you give 1P to).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why not do it?  &quot;Its not part of our vision.&quot;<br/>
