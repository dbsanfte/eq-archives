<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487741998">I almost never have the nuker type finger wiggler in the party... The usual<br/>
make up is 2 tanks, 2 shamans, a druid and me.  We tend to have very little<br/>
down time since the shamans and druid simply assist in melee combat, snare<br/>
and cast heals when necessary.  When we do get a finger wiggler nuker in the<br/>
party, they tend to almost NEVER have mana as my pulling habits are hard to<br/>
change :=).  Unfortunately, with no nukers, the combat sequences tend to<br/>
last a long time and I tend to get very tired... after all I&#39;m only a wood<br/>
elf.  Having mostly Lambent (minus the BP) has helped, but I still seem to<br/>
loose stamina at an alarming rate.  The only time I really end combat with<br/>
decent stamina is when I pull bad and spend my time playing lullaby or pixie<br/>
striking to keep the extras dis-interested.  Of course in those situations,<br/>
I usually loose an equivalent amount of health instead :=)<br/>

&gt; Your info is quite correct.  I got lucky and got the predator to drop the<br/>
&gt; shard a few weeks ago.  I used it for 2 nights and now its collecting dust<br/>
&gt; in the bank.  Its not only resisted a lot, forget about using it in Sol A,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s resisted damn near every time.  I am rather surprised about<br/>
&gt; the stamina<br/>
&gt; problems that the initial poster of this thread mentioned.  The scimi/dirk<br/>
&gt; combo is the same setup I use, and I have yet to see my stamina drop more<br/>
&gt; than a bubble.  In fact, I often drop my dirk in my ranged slot and dual<br/>
&gt; wield 2 OS&#39;s with very similar results stamina wise.  Maybe its the group<br/>
&gt; makeup I have, I imagine if you run in a caster heavy group, you<br/>
&gt; would have<br/>
&gt; that problem when mana runs low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>
&gt; The Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>
&gt; The Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>
&gt; opinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>
&gt; thought it could be hehe.  I personally was very disappointed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s nice, but I&#39;ve been camping the predator for weeks and<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t got<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shard and I can&#39;t seem to find anyone on Prexus willing to sell or trade<br/>
&gt; &gt; one.  Additionally, I&#39;m told that above 30 it starts to get<br/>
&gt; resisted A LOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; and being of the 29th song...  So given the shard seems out of the<br/>
&gt; question:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is a obsidian scimitar a good trade for a silvery war axe or<br/>
&gt; should I hold<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for something better?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been having stamina problems duel wielding an obsidian<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; scimitar and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dragoon dirk in long battles.  I&#39;m currently trying to figure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out what to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replace the scimitar with, but I&#39;m not all that sure of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trade value of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  I&#39;ve got an offer on the table of a Silvery War Axe for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Obsidian<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scimitar.  Is this a good trade?<br/>
