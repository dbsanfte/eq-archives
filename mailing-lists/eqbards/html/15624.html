 </span></blockquote>Heh, only in part to cover having written a big treatise based on something<br/>
you didn&#39;t imply :o) I want to add to it a bit.<br/>
The problem with enforcement of game laws by actual humans is several-fold,<br/>
to start, nobody (currently defined as OSI and Verant and I am sure this is<br/>
true for AC as well ) can afford to have their support staffed by mature,<br/>
responsible people trained in conflict mediation and resolution, because<br/>
said folks (with or without the training) largely need to earn a living<br/>
wage. So they end up hiring people who think the job is cool enough to<br/>
accept a low salary. And while I am sure the two populations (mature,<br/>
responsible/accepts cool over money) have some intersect, I don&#39;t believe it<br/>
is going to be a huge pool to draw from.<br/>
The &quot;cool&quot; aspect is another problem, how &quot;cool&quot; is a job if no one knows<br/>
you or sees you doing it? This leads to GM/player fraternization, which<br/>
leads to the *perception* of favoritism whether favoritism exists or not.<br/>
Even if you ignore the worst excesses *cough*UO&#39;s Smurf/GM sex<br/>
scandal*cough* you still are going to have major problems when staff is<br/>
making judgement calls that favor one player over another. People will<br/>
fairly want due process. How&#39;s THAT for overhead costs?<br/>
This is in part why I was only a Smurf during a time I wasn&#39;t, er,<br/>
agitating, and why I never accepted creating story through &quot;official<br/>
channels&quot;, the stuff I was doing was volatile enough that all perceptions of<br/>
favoritism had to be avoided.<br/>
So, as much as I despise sharing a zone with jerks, as much as I really<br/>
truly, in my heart of hearts just want everyone to have high quality fun, I<br/>
don&#39;t see a way to regulate social behavior except the sum average of<br/>
collective agreement.<br/>
