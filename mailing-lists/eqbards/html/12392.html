<div id="ygrps-yiv-274861969">One thing we are really lucky about as a class, especially in planes and<br/>
for dragons, is that there are so few bards, we generally know of each<br/>
other. When you hit PoH, there is maybe 1-3 bards, like rogues, so<br/>
instead of just /randoming everything, I like to ask what everyone is<br/>
after in particular. Then we take that and decide who will get what<br/>
before anything drops, or what will be lotto&#39;d. It allows all of us to<br/>
focus on the challenging fights and enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
One other note on Cazic, maybe someone can answer this. The other night,<br/>
we attacked Cazic Thule after he respawned (they need to make this<br/>
shorter) and when he was at 50%, we get the message &quot;The world server is<br/>
coming down, log out now!&quot; In the next 45 seconds we got Cazic to 5%,<br/>
with only 5 deaths up to that point from DTs out of our 30-person force.<br/>
The server then crashed, causing CT to despawn. He of course doesn&#39;t<br/>
spawn on server restart to add insult to injury. Here is my question.<br/>
Cazic was playing a flute. What was this? I&#39;ve gone to PoF many trips<br/>
since PoH opened with the understanding there are no bard drops there,<br/>
only to see Cazic playing an instrument. If anyone knows of its affects<br/>
or stats I&#39;d like to see what Ziann and I missed out on. Thanks. ;)<br/>
