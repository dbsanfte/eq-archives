<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019492739">As you said it all depends on what your camping. Personally the only reason<br/>
I think yaks should go to anybody is because they are common. My guild held<br/>
the spot for 20 hours one day so we could get everybody who needed a yak<br/>
some and we ended up with 7. Hold the magi 20 hours and you&#39;ll  be doing<br/>
good to get a SMR. Same thing with sash. If it&#39;s rare or a pain in the ass<br/>
to get to then it should go to who can use it. If it&#39;s common then it should<br/>
go to who ever wins the lotto. That&#39;s my opinion anyway.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Shada - Just out of curiosity, why aren&#39;t the instruments<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;bards before others&quot;?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Is that so obvious that it&#39;s assumed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hehe yes, which you answered in your reply to your own post.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been in a lot of groups lately that seem to believe that<br/>
&gt;&gt; drops should go to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the player who can best utilize them, with lottos if there is<br/>
&gt;&gt; some dispute over<br/>
&gt;&gt; who would reap the most benefit.  Not so curiously, they<br/>
&gt;&gt; rarely seem to believe<br/>
&gt;&gt; that a Bard can reap the most benefit from anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;like jhenderson, i agree with you both here.  i wanted a ykesha as much as<br/>
&gt;the next guy, and i can use it and more importantly WOULD use it.  any<br/>

&gt;they&#39;re going to their twinks or getting traded.  so i guess the 3 types of<br/>
&gt;lottos are everyone in, only those who can use, or those that can use it<br/>
&gt;best.  just depends on what you&#39;re camping and what kind of group you are<br/>
&gt;in.<br/>
