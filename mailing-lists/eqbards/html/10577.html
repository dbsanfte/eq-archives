<div id="ygrps-yiv-926989505">From what I can tell, it still works, just not all the time. Sometimes you <br/>
get the song&#39;s message (I forget what it is), but the effect doesn&#39;t go away <br/>
(DoT, Root, buffs, etc). You may have to use it repeatedly kind of in the <br/>
same vein as Pixie Strike, unfortunately. Normally, I will only use it in <br/>
standard practice if there is no one dispelling creatures that have nasty <br/>
dmg shield. Ever fight those elementals guarding the Reckless Efreet in Sol <br/>
A? OMG what a nightmare if they are shielded and you can&#39;t remove it - even <br/>
at lvl 50. Also sometimes have it memmed if fighting Lava Duct Crawlers. <br/>
Thought about using it in case a party member might gets charmed by an NPC, <br/>
but never got a chance to try it.<br/>
