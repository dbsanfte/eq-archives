<br/>
Do some exploring in Rathe Mts - its one heck of a zone.  Get a map if you<br/>
are so inclined because it&#39;s as bad or worse than Steamfont and ButcherBlock<br/>
with &#39;dead end&#39; canyons, etc. But here is a quick run down...<br/>
<br/>
From Lake zone, if you go to the right and follow the wall, you will find an<br/>
undead camp.  It also has a gnome necro (or mage? pet caster I think.)<br/>
Variety of undead spawn there. You can keep going and follow that wall til<br/>
you get to the gypsy camp.   By now you will have circled almost the Homer<br/>
Plateau.  Clops and GSkels spawn on sides and top and in the valley floor.<br/>
Heh, my 27 - now 28 wizard has been busy dutifully KS&#39;ing them from me.<br/>
<br/>
At gypsy camp, you can either cut back to the lake zone (or from lake zone,<br/>
instead of going around Homer Hill, you could have cut to the Gypsys) or go<br/>
around the cornor hugging wall on right to see some Inns & Shops. If you<br/>
have a dragon scale and lots of money, Karim Darkforge will make you some<br/>
pretty good armor &lt;g&gt; otherwise stock up on bloodstones & jaspers (oh yeah,<br/>
want to change gold and silver to plat? Buy a combine wep from the gypsy and<br/>
sell it back for a 10% exchange rate.)  And if you skirt behind the inns and<br/>
keep going down the path, soon you pass the named bugs and if you keep going<br/>
slightly left-ish, you will see on the right a path over a rock where likely<br/>
mobs will be &#39;stuck&#39; and spinning.  This is &quot;the stuck rock&quot; or &quot;spinning<br/>
stone&quot; and if you go through that pass and kind hug right wall soon enough<br/>
it opens and there is a plateau ahead and a path to right.<br/>
<br/>
That plateau is Hill Giant Hill.  With HG, Homers & GSkells. Actually all<br/>
over in this area are HG, Clops & GSkels. So those are some places to<br/>
explore.  Find a spot on edge to camp and pull stuff to your camp.<br/>
<br/>
If you go back out by stuck rock and keep going - over more ricks and stuff<br/>
but straight-ish, soon there is the zone to Feerot. And you will be going<br/>
this way to get to Cazic Thule in about 5 more levels.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

&gt; Greetings everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hunted Giant Skeletons over the weekend near the entrance to Lake Rathe.<br/>
&gt; I was in a low 20&#39;s group of 4 and the xp was great.  Is there another<br/>
area<br/>
&gt; besides the one at the entrance to LR that has the GSs?  We were having to<br/>
&gt; split the spawn with another group and could have handled a faster spawn<br/>
&gt; rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
