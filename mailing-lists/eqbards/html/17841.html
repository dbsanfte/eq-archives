&gt; I would imagine that the Haste effects jumping to 75% no matter which ones<br/>
&gt; you combine is a bug.  As such eventually its liable to get fixed,<br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; sooner rather than later since its a bug that benefits players.  Once this<br/>
&gt; happens those lower end Haste items are not going to be as good for a bard<br/>
&gt; as the high end ones, any more than they are for melee types.<br/>
<br/>
If it gets fixed, it&#39;s even *more* reason for other melee<br/>
classes to get the high end haste items before us.  Right now,<br/>
since item+song = max haste, a 30% haste item results in a 35%<br/>
net improvement for a bard (1.3 to 1.75) , but only 30% net<br/>
improvement for a melee class (1.0 to 1.3).<br/>
<br/>
If it were fixed:<br/>
<br/>
If a bard gets a 30% haste item and stacks it with his 30%<br/>
haste song, his net improvement is only 23% (from 1.3 to 1.6).<br/>
<br/>
If a melee class gets a 30% haste item, his net improvement is<br/>
30% (1.0 to 1.3), i.e. more than a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Couple this with a normal melee class doing more melee<br/>
damage/time than a bard, and it&#39;s even more compelling reason<br/>
for them to get priority over a bard.<br/>
<br/>
And our song damage vastly exceeds our melee damage at max<br/>
haste anyway, so that part of the argument remains unchanged.<br/>
