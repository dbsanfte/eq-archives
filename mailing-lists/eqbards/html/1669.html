<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178891030">Yes, what you and others say here is different from the situation we were<br/>
talking about but the effect is probably compounded.  The discussion we were<br/>
having was why do the mobs come off the tanks and hit the bard.  If there is<br/>
a general all mobs hate bards bug - as you have observed -- then that in<br/>
combination with mobs hating everyone in the party that is attacking them -<br/>
which is &#39;correct&#39; mob AI - imho - the end result is bad for the bard in<br/>
either case.<br/>

		&gt; I think we are saying the same thing here - yes the bard<br/>
gets the mob&#39;s<br/>

can sense who they<br/>
		&gt; should kill and they see you as both dangerous to them and<br/>
as easy to kill.<br/>
		&gt; Because you are in the party that attacked one of their<br/>
party - you get put<br/>
		&gt; on their hate list.  All of them now hate you.  You are<br/>
right it is a<br/>
		&gt; programming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>
<br/>
		As several people have pointed out, mobs that *other* people<br/>
		are attacking, unrelated to your party, will come over and<br/>

		singing.<br/>
<br/>
		Surely it can&#39;t be intended that the gnoll soothsayer the<br/>

a<br/>

		and the only thing I&#39;m doing is watching and singing<br/>
		Accelerando on myself.<br/>
