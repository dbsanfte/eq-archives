&gt; &gt;I have one thing to say.. roleplay.. it is what you want<br/>
&gt; &gt;to make (ie. &#39;roleplay&#39;).  If you are a wizard (or a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;in this case), you would generally not wear items such<br/>
&gt; &gt;as platemail as it&#39;s weight and restrictivness in movement<br/>
&gt; &gt;would hinder the caster&#39;s ability; however, it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;that they couldn&#39;t equip/wear the item, it just would<br/>
&gt; &gt;introduce a possibilty of penalties (ie. more difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt;to cast successfully through lower dex and lower agility).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Should Clerics, Paladins, Shadowknights and Rangers also<br/>
&gt; suffer this same penalty when casting in Plate, or are you<br/>
&gt; recommending a Bard-only penalty?<br/>

internal justification for the way things work.<br/>
<br/>
The way it *should* work is that heavier armor induces<br/>
spellcasting penalties.  Thus rangers are weaker spellcasters<br/>
than druids because of the heavier armor they wear (and<br/>
possibly lack of complete training).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the game(s) that have tried this system (e.g.<br/>
UO) have not done a very good job of balancing it, resulting<br/>
in one optimal point (usually tank-mage) and everyone<br/>
clamoring to get their characters to that point.  A well<br/>
balanced skill based system would make the pure mage overall<br/>
as effective as a pure warrior as effective as any combination<br/>
in between.  Achieving this balance though is extraordinarily<br/>
difficult because of the multitude of capabilities and degrees<br/>
of freedom in tweaking skills.<br/>
<br/>
A class based system simply avoids this balancing problem by<br/>
enforcing armor and weapon restrictions based on class.  i.e.<br/>
In a skill based system you are a pure wizard because you wear<br/>
no armor.  In a class based system you wear no armor because<br/>
you are a wizard.  What roleplaying justification can you come<br/>
up with for druids not wearing armor while other spellcasters<br/>
tossing around the same spells can?  Their guild requires it?<br/>
Why?  These &quot;arbitrary&quot; (using in-character logic)<br/>
restrictions are simply the artifical support joints of the<br/>
class based system showing through like poorly fitted<br/>
floorboards through a carpet.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a class-based system, the designers have chosen<br/>
to make it so the bard is balanced wearing plate.  The<br/>
effectiveness of our songs assumes the restrictions imposed by<br/>
wearing plate.  Yes, they could scale the effectiveness based<br/>
on armor, but then you&#39;re moving away from a class based<br/>
system and towards a skill based system.  The designers have<br/>
for reasons of simplicity in balance chosen to go with<br/>
classes, which makes these types of skill restrictions<br/>
redundant, and lot of programming work for minor gain.  You do<br/>
not have to wear plate, but please do not denigrate those of<br/>
us who do - the game designers are on the side of bards<br/>
wearing plate.<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, I consider well-implemented skill-based<br/>
systems to be vastly superior to class based systems.  I think<br/>
a system where spellcasting and song-weaving effectiveness<br/>
were inversely proportional to armor weight (among other<br/>
things) would rock.<br/>
