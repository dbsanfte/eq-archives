<div id="ygrps-yiv-911333203">Bards do not need bind and are not going to get it.  Group bind?  Absolutely<br/>
rediculous, although I sincerely salute the creativity of the orginal<br/>
alt.games.everquest poster&#39;s suggestion.  Can you imagine the uproar from the<br/>
other classes (especially melee) if we got GROUP BIND?<br/>
<br/>
The one hope that I would extend to my fellow bards that can&#39;t seem to come to<br/>
grips with the fact that they don&#39;t need bind is that the Expansion Pack will<br/>
probably have to have 25 new songs in it for levels 51-75.  Maybe you guys<br/>
will get a bind affinity song in there somewhere, but I doubt it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Bard&#39;s Bind would have a lengthy casting time instead of the usual &quot;3.0&quot;.<br/>
&gt; And it would use mana, and a component (a piece of ore, or maybe some other<br/>
&gt; item which would fuel a bit of economy). </span></blockquote></div>
