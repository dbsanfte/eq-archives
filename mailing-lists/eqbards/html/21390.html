<div id="ygrps-yiv-236222874">I announced this to my guild this weekend:<br/>
<br/>
There are two new rules for all bard sin our guilds (I am the only one).<br/>
<br/>
#1  I am not allowed to pull.  (I am terrible at it, and hate doing it, as I<br/>
need restime after weaving)<br/>
<br/>
#2 I am not allowed to lead anyone, anywhere.  OUr problem is I know most of<br/>
the zones better than anyone in our guild, (since I love turning on selos<br/>
and exploring places).  The problem is I have killed about 10 people in the<br/>
last month.  (Through dropping them off cliffs, blowing past agressive<br/>
monsters, etc...).  I told them I if they truly need to be shown how to get<br/>
somewhere I will follow them and tell them where to go...</div>
