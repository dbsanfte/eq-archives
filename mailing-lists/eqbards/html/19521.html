<div id="ygrps-yiv-719982292">one day a few weeks ago, venril sathir came to the zone of karnor&#39;s,<br/>
apparently with no other reason but to kill the zone campers (this was<br/>
before we ever killed him, and no one aggro&#39;d or pulled him in the zone).<br/>
all GMs insisted he was not GM controlled, people lost experience dying to<br/>
him.  right before he came, there was a zone-wide emote &quot;You feel as if you<br/>
should run&quot; =)<br/>
