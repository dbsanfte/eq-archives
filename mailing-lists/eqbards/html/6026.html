&gt;	This is my guess. Most MUD based games have special rooms created by the<br/>
&gt;game masters (generally called wizards, gods, etc.) that are their<br/>
&gt;workshops. In these workshops are the parent items of things in the game. It<br/>
&gt;could be that these npc&#39;s are the parent objects of the npc&#39;s that we see in<br/>
&gt;the game and when one gets killed it gets cloned from this parent npc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to be a know-it-all :P  but, those NPCs from what I understand, are<br/>
NPCs that have fallen through the world and are trapped.  Notice the<br/>
corpses in the screen shot with all the NPCs and the bear (and notice the<br/>
&quot;broken&quot; NPCs (mobs that have a ! in front of their name, or have the wrong<br/>
model (such as orcs that look like humans)).<br/>
