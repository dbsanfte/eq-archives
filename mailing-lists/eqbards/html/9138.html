<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120803443">Got a couple of questions I want to run by everyone to see what you have to<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
Question 1<br/>
<br/>
Last night while I was in Mistmoore, a friend sent me a message over /tell<br/>
telling me about how much fun he had while he was in Mistmoore.  He remarked<br/>
that the amount of experience points he got while he was there was<br/>
&#39;awesome&#39;.  He believed that the mobs in Mistmoore gave more experience than<br/>
mobs in other places.  As a 25th level bard, the Mistmoore yard trash all<br/>
conned blue to me.  I have always read that the /con of a mob was more an<br/>
indication of how much experience you would receive from killing it rather<br/>
than how tough the mob is.  Assuming this is true, a blue mob in Mistmoore<br/>
should give the same amount of experience as a blue mob anywhere else.  With<br/>
that said, it did seem to me that my experience bar did move much faster<br/>
last night than it had in recent adventures in other zones.  I see three<br/>
possible explanations for this: 1) my perception was clouded based on the<br/>
comment of my friend and I only thought I was getting more experience, 2)<br/>
the mobs in Mistmoore do give more experience than mobs in other locations,<br/>
or 3) the spawn rate is Mistmoore is so high that there isn&#39;t much downtime<br/>
and as a result you get to kill more stuff, resulting in more experience<br/>
gain.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone with definitive knowledge please confirm the real answer? <br/>
<br/>
Question 2<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I have been adventuring in Unrest and Mistmoore in an attempt to get<br/>
the quest components for the bard armor.  While in Unrest, I joined a 30+<br/>
group in the Ghost room.  The highest level person was 38.  I&#39;m 25th level<br/>
and I got no experience from any kill for the entire time I was there.  I<br/>
did get the bracelet from the GDB so overall it was mission success.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Unrest I grouped with some guildmates who were all 30+ level.<br/>
This time, the highest level person was 34 and I got experience when we<br/>
killed stuff.  This was the first time I had ever grouped with anyone where<br/>
the level differential (9 levels between highest to lowest) was that high<br/>
and I still got experience.  Everything we were fighting conned red to me.<br/>
In comparison, when I group with people close to me in level, we usually try<br/>
to take on mobs that con blue or black to me.  That leads to the following<br/>
question:<br/>
<br/>
Given the situation I just described, and over the same amount of time,<br/>
would the total experience received in both situations come close to being<br/>
equal?  In other words, does grouping with higher level characters fighting<br/>
mobs that con red to you equal (or come close to equalling) grouping with<br/>
equal level characters fighting mobs that con blue to you?  <br/>
<br/>
I tend to prefer grouping with characters close to me in level but there are<br/>
often situations late at night when its hard to find other players to group<br/>
with.  Knowing that I could still get good experience grouping with<br/>
characters a lot higher than me gives me a second option.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
