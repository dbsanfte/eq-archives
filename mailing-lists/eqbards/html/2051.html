&gt; I had the misfortune to get killed by Murissa Sandwhisper the other day.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was not aware that she would attack someone unprovoked.  I was in North Ro<br/>
<br/>
She was not unprovoked.  :-)<br/>

Spoiler spacing for those who wish to try to figure out on<br/>
their own why Murissa kills them.<br/>

&gt; I now know to avoid her.  However, one day I will get my revenge.  Does<br/>
&gt; anyone know if she is part of a quest?  Also, when I do get my revenge, is<br/>
&gt; there a major faction hit with anyone in Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she is aligned with the cutthroat dervishes.<br/>
Yes, all those messages you ignored saying &quot;Your faction with<br/>
the Cutthroat Dervishes got worse&quot; has a consequence.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the faction connection is<br/>
with the merchant in the first building on the right as you<br/>
enter East Commonlands from Freeport.  She stopped selling to<br/>
me long before I ever met dervishes.<br/>
