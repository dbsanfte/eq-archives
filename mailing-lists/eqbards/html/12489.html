<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707668773">dunno if i thought about it or just did it instinctively, but like you said<br/>
i don&#39;t play any buffs during pulls.  i play mana song all the way til the<br/>
pull is in, then i start up with buffs.  pretty sure mana song is no taunt,<br/>
right?<br/>

&gt; party buffs and a monster trains in late, look at it&#39;s aggro list..&#39;I<br/>
&gt; see 24 people here, I hate them all, but I see 3 people that <br/>
&gt; are buffing<br/>
&gt; the rest like mad, boy this pisses me off!&#39; And those 3 would be bards<br/>
&gt; playing Verses of Victory for example. </span></blockquote></div>
