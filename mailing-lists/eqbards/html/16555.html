<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] New song idea <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268589213"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I came up with a song that is the opposite of<br/>
&gt; Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion.  A song that teleports<br/>
&gt; all party members in the zone to the bards location.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I like your song idea.  Verant would want control over <br/>
  the song for reasons you suggested.  I think the amount<br/>
  of control they would have to exert would leave them<br/>
  desiring this song less and less.  They would probably<br/>
  not allow it to work in the planes.  And most likely <br/>
  other areas would fall into the restricted access.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as new and valuable, that song is one of the best<br/>
  I&#39;ve seen so far.  I suggest it goes on the list, and maybe<br/>
  it will spark new ideas from Verant.<br/>
