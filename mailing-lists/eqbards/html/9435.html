<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144336749">PoH was opened this weekend.  That was the reason for all the undead all<br/>
over the place and the GM events on all the servers - PoH was opened and<br/>
released hell spawn onto Norrath.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; A fellow bard has heard rumor of a bard only &quot;ultimate&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon called the<br/>
&gt; &gt; quill that procs gate.  He says it is found in the Plane of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hate on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maestro of Rancor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plane of Hate?  I thought that wasn&#39;t going to be &quot;open&quot; to the general<br/>
&gt; public until march (when, allegedly, the expansion is coming out).<br/>
