<br/>
Level 53 and above who attack either dragon get punted to the edge of the<br/>
zone now.  Several people from one of the higher level guilds on Saryrn were<br/>
talking about it tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t heard if this happens if they buff/heal people fighting.  If you can<br/>
buff/heal safely then bards, clerics, shaman won&#39;t be much affected since<br/>
their primary roles are heals/buffs/resists rather than raw combat.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I wonder if the coding they have that prevents spells from<br/>
&gt; working on higher<br/>
&gt; level mobs was somehow used here.  Just a thought, but it would be nice of<br/>
&gt; them if a weaker dragon simply dodged everything a 53+ player<br/>
&gt; swung/cast/throw at them.  Kinda takes away from role-playing if you can<br/>
&gt; kill a tougher dragon, but get death touched by a weaker one.<br/>

&gt; But there I go again using the R-P word.  I might get banned for this if I<br/>
&gt; keep it up.  ;^)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmm, I wonder exactly what this means?  Will they banish the higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels?  Port them away?  Maybe kind of like a DT?  I don&#39;t think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; quite understand this, well, we&#39;ll see what happens when someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; tries it... heh.<br/>
