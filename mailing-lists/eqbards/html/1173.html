<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164465414"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt; It just doesn&#39;t fit my idea of the classic bard. We are seldom <br/>
&gt;portrayed as<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tanks. We are singers of songs. Maybe even lifters of purses or players <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; practical jokes. Light on our feet and quick about our wits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now let me get this straight: Putting yourself in the position of a real <br/>
combat bard (as we are) do you mean to tell me that when you seem to be the <br/>
primary target in every fight you get into (which is ALL the time) that <br/>
you&#39;re not going to be scrambling for the best armor you can find for fear <br/>
of tarnishing your image?<br/>
In my mind this would make one either an extremely vain or extremely foolish <br/>
bard, or perhaps both.<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>
