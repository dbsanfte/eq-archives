<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789848575">Thank&#39;y for the response JM!<br/>
<br/>
My post was actually inspired by a thread on the -other- EQ Bards list on onelist (one list, ironic!).  I decided I&#39;d throw my response from there to here, maybe get a few comments on it since this list has much more traffic.  I still like my idea of specializing in an instrument, hehe.  Personally, I&#39;m no where near the level of these fellows from this thread, so I&#39;ll refrain judgement on the powers of high level bards until I am one.  I guess I&#39;ll cut and paste your comments over there so those guys can read them!<br/>

Hi Crip Fireblade from FoH here...<br/>
lvl 49 bard on Veeshan<br/>
<br/>
    My question or statement is really bards are totally screwed over at high levels.<br/>
Not only do they have no chance of meleeing even a tenth as well as a warrior, but there<br/>
are NO high level songs that are worthwhile. Berserk at lvl 42 is barely better than<br/>
celerity at lvl 36, which is BARELY better than anthem de arms at level 10. Im still<br/>
using chains which i aquired at lvl 23 along with bellow from level 12. The only reason<br/>
anyone will group with a bard is to get the mana song from level 32. The new songs that<br/>
were added about a month ago are either worthless or hidden deep deep somewhere (if they<br/>
exist at all). I have searched everywhere and im still missing six songs. Just my little<br/>
rant, respon if you have any insight. (I hope i didn&#39;t discourage any of you lower level<br/>
bards out there =P)<br/>

I totally agree with you and feel your pain heh<br/>
I recently stopped playing my level 29 bard for similar reasons.  I think <br/>
bards are totally unbalanced compared to other classes, I have to group or <br/>
die, i can&#39;t solo anything unless i kite it or its about 10 levels below me. <br/>
  I&#39;m very frustrated, she is so hard to play.  I started a druid and i&#39;m a <br/>
lot happier with her.  She&#39;s a lot more self sufficient than my bard and i <br/>
can solo if i want to.  Basically it seems to me that a bard is nothing more <br/>
than a very weak tank char with some fun songs and not enough damage <br/>
capability or ability to take much damage either.<br/>

tell you one thing, bards are not all that bad. From the beginning though<br/>
you need to group with people. One of the worst things about this class, is<br/>
that you HAVE to be grouped unless you learn how to kite using speed and the<br/>
level 2 dmg song. Takes a long time though. I know one person that just ran<br/>
around the zone picking up MOBs doing this and gained SOO much exp it wasnt<br/>
funny.<br/>
<br/>
Most of a bard&#39;s spells are useless though, especially at higher levels. The<br/>
ones that are best are celerity and the mana song. other than that it just<br/>
seems like verant just through in songs cause they couldnt think of decent<br/>
ones. But bards are fun, and you can wear a lot of items and armor unlike<br/>
other non warriors. you also get to use &quot;spells&quot; with no mana cost, well you<br/>
could until the recent changes. I havent played a high level bard but i know<br/>
the highest level ones on my server, and they seem overly pleased. The key<br/>
is to know your weaknesses and strengths, and try to maximize your<br/>
efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
I play a druid but I already learned mine. I cant tank major monsters but I<br/>
can take a few hits when i need to pull a MOB off a dieing friend. I know<br/>
just how many heals to get off before I am at risk of getting jacked by<br/>
MOBs. I know the limit of my fire based spells and where they are useless<br/>
at. I know how to maximize the use of my outdoor spells and how to get by in<br/>
dungeons after I cannot use them anymore.  Just be patient and learn how to<br/>
survive. Its like all classes and you will learn to love the class despite<br/>
the short comings.<br/>

ye but what good are those items if you can&#39;t do anything with them? The fact<br/>
is, bards are great at lower levels, especially in their teens, but once they&#39;re<br/>
in their 30s, then their 40s, and finally 50, well they start to suck. A level<br/>
40 bard is almost equal in power to a level 50 bard. It makes no sense, and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem verant is making an effort in fixing them, they&#39;re actually making<br/>
bards worse.</div>
