<b>Subject:</b> Mino horns & small brass trumpets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-946675517">I have seen these items posted claiming improved song affects?  I had a mino<br/>
horn back when it was a bag on your hand, I know they fixed the graphic, but<br/>
did they improve the affect of this instrument?  And what about a small<br/>
brass trumpet?  How do I get one of those?  I have seen the parts, but<br/>
unless I missed something, I have not see an assembled small brass trumpet?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info<br/>

loot!!!  Great means 3 lvls in 2 days, only 2 deaths :)</div>
