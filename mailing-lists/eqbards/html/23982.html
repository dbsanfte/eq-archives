<div id="ygrps-yiv-480045706">At 12:33 PM 2/26/01 -0700, you wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Only double the percentage of non-anon, non-rp bards on Xegony.  Highly<br/>
&gt;unlikely to be the same thing.  You&#39;ll never see Kitasi pop up on a /who all<br/>
&gt;bard on E&#39;ci as I am always /roleplay.  Also most of those people logged<br/>
&gt;onto pvp servers are not engaging in pvp activities most of the time.  The<br/>
&gt;decision to balance anything because of pvp is one of Verant&#39;s most<br/>
&gt;ludicrous ideas.  Even if every single one of the people in your example was<br/>
&gt;engaged in pvp when you took the sample they would still only constitute<br/>
&gt;less than 7% of the people playing.   Since that is 7% out of two possible<br/>
&gt;choices it is an insignificant amount.  4% out of 14 possible choices on the<br/>
&gt;other hand is not insignificant by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>um wrong, common error.  the 4% is out of 2000 people playing at the time.<br/>
the 7% was out of 38000 or so people playing at the time.  percentages are<br/>
hard numbers if you relate them to the same or comparable things.  In this <br/>
case both are related to the number of people playing at a specific time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also yes bards may be less than 5% of the population on some servers.  But,<br/>
&gt;since you are taking a sub-part that is virtually guaranteed to be small in<br/>
&gt;percentage your argument has no weight.  If there were an equal number of<br/>
&gt;every class in the populations then bards would still only number 7.14%<br/>
&gt;(100/14).  Given that fact, even 3% would be a very significant percentage<br/>
&gt;since they would still number half as many as could be expected all else<br/>
&gt;being equal.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, we&#39;re talking about the big picture here.  just because there are more choices<br/>
doesn&#39;t make one minority any less significant than another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Statistical analysis guarantees in fact that if a classes percentage falls<br/>
&gt;below a certain threshold in relation to this equality, then that class is<br/>
&gt;in fact underpowered or less enjoyable to play.  If all the classes were<br/>
&gt;equally balanced then the percentages of each across such a large base would<br/>
&gt;be effectively equivalent to 100/14.  The unmistakable fact that it is not<br/>
&gt;is analytical proof that the classes were not balanced in terms of power<br/>
&gt;level, usefulness, and enjoyability.  Apparently someone at Verant finally<br/>
&gt;realized this which is why we see so many intensive changes recently.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this has nothing to do with my point, which was that you cannot selectively disregard<br/>
small segments of the population in an mmorpg because EVERYONE is part of a small<br/>
segment of the population.  just because it doesn&#39;t affect YOU doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are overpowered.  The<br/>
&gt;statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that were true, in a game<br/>
&gt;dominated by the mechanics of level advancement and ability to overpower<br/>
&gt;foes, then there would be more than the flat (100/14)% bards.  There are<br/>
&gt;not.  It is not because bards are some great secret either.  Sure a lot of<br/>
&gt;people don&#39;t know all that bards can do, but that is because it takes far,<br/>
&gt;far more work to play a bard than any other class.  Probably why I like<br/>
&gt;them, they are much more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the<br/>
&gt;occasional taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards can do, then a major reason there aren&#39;t more<br/>
bards would be ignorance, not some &#39;&#39;underpoweredness&#39;&#39; to the class.  i agree that bards<br/>
are one of the harder classes to play to their fullest abilities, but that fact does not make<br/>
bards underpowered.  when comparing classes, you should compare the fullest abilities<br/>
of class X with the fullest abilities of class Y.   and those are 2 of the big reasons that bards<br/>
are underrepresented, 1.  people don&#39;t know what bards can do, 2.  the people who do know<br/>
what bards can do don&#39;t want to work that hard when they are playing a game.</div>
