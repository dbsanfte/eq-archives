<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396951297">Don&#39;t know how much anyone else has looked so far, but my search was a bust. <br/>
Killed 19 HG&#39;s and no not one had a lambent on it; at least the loot if good. <br/>
 Wouldn&#39;t have gotten one all night had it not been for someone kind enought <br/>
to toss one my way (and another for Shada from his friend :) ). <br/>
I don&#39;t know how anyone else&#39;s luck has been, but if for every piece I go for <br/>
I have to kill 20+ HG&#39;s. It&#39;s gonna be a LONG time before I have even 2 or 3 <br/>
pieces. Ah well, guess thats Verant&#39;s idea to keep me here :P<br/>
