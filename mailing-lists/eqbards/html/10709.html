you started a lot later then most people. I see level 10&#39;s not twinked<br/>
walking around in bronze armor. I remember when it was rare to see a level<br/>
20 in bronze. You guys don&#39;t have anything to upgrade is becausey ou have<br/>
good stuff a bit earlier then you were ment to. There is nothing you can do<br/>

&gt;Preach on!  I have the same weapons I had in what, June I think.  5months,<br/>
&gt;with no upgrade in sight.  I lose half a stamina bar in a fight with two<br/>

&gt;I will have to agree on items available for bards at 20th level or so. I<br/>
&gt;would love to get rid of my Barbed Leather Whip, but to replace it with<br/>
&gt;what? If I could dual wield PGTs, that would be good, but they are still<br/>
&gt;relatively slow, heavy, and only do 6 damage. The only viable replacements<br/>
&gt;that I know of are way too expensive/hard to get. (Kilij, Crystalline<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The same goes for armor. I have been wearing bronze for quite awhile, and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I have had basically the same equipment for months, and with nothing to<br/>
&gt;look forward to for another few months.   *sigh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I am overlooking something, I would love to hear about it. I would<br/>

&gt;that would result in a nice weapon or magic instrument.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And speaking of instruments, if there were some better instruments around,<br/>
&gt;maybe I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on my poor melee skills so much. I would love<br/>
&gt;to sit back and play songs during melee, as I don&#39;t have the HPs to really<br/>
&gt;mix it up anymore anyway, but it&#39;s just not quite enough for me as I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to be able to weave 4 songs at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And all these balance issues, while significant, don&#39;t take into account<br/>
&gt;twinking, which is the biggest unbalancing factor, I think. Of course, with<br/>
&gt;the scarcity of attainable items and the game bias against those of us who<br/>

&gt;Brian&#39;s post is interesting, but I&#39;m not sure it is all that accurate.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps this is accurately what Verant wants to be true, but it is not<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt;is true.  Monks out damage warriors only until the warrior gains some<br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt;weapons around 15th level or so.  After that the warrior often out<br/>
&gt;damages<br/>
&gt;the monk, but the monk takes less damage.  The reason for this?  The<br/>
&gt;monk<br/>
&gt;having no offensive items to spend money on is free to spend all his<br/>
&gt;funds<br/>
&gt;to acquire better defensive items.  The two do seem to balance out with<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;warrior doing more damage but the monk taking less.  Despite not being<br/>
&gt;able<br/>
&gt;to wear heavy armor our group monk who is 2 levels lower than me has<br/>
&gt;nearly<br/>
&gt;the same ac I do, and I have only one piece of armor with an AC below<br/>
&gt;banded<br/>
&gt;and several at plate or higher.  He takes way less damage than I do and<br/>
&gt;until he is 35th level will probably never die again except in very rare<br/>
&gt;circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt;one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.<br/>
&gt;A<br/>
&gt;piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention<br/>
&gt;bard<br/>
&gt;only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is<br/>
&gt;useless<br/>
&gt;after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What<br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know what it would be.  Are there even any other items on mobs<br/>
&gt;below<br/>
&gt;30th that are bard plus a few others?  Shimmering Orb, great for looks<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;with dual wield is it useful?  Anyone know of anything else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items,<br/>
&gt;why<br/>
&gt;is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th<br/>
&gt;level?<br/>
&gt;There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and<br/>
&gt;screaming<br/>
&gt;mace available for bards at my level.  The only 1HS weapons available<br/>
&gt;are a<br/>
&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk and a Barbed Leather Whip.  They don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;begin<br/>
&gt;to compare to our Shadowknight&#39;s Dark Reaver.  The primary weapons<br/>
&gt;carried<br/>
&gt;by every member of our group is better than either the PGT or the BLW.<br/>
&gt;Why?<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s a good question.  Since we don&#39;t have anybody near my level who<br/>
&gt;is a<br/>
&gt;melee class (or hybrid other than the SK) its really puzzling.  Our<br/>
&gt;mages<br/>
&gt;carry Glowing Wooden Crooks or better, at 150pp not hard to see why.<br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt;shadowknight has a dark Reaver and I&#39;m using the same primary as the 7th<br/>
&gt;level ranger, a dragoon dirk.  At 25pp who would blame him?  A good 1HS<br/>
&gt;weapon on the other hand cost 400pp+.<br/>
&gt;Why does this inequity exist?  Because in truth their are far more good<br/>
&gt;piercing weapons per piercing user than 1HS per 1HS user.  All the good<br/>
&gt;1HS<br/>
&gt;weapons at the mid-levels are either warrior or paladin or ranger only.<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;could currently get thru quests at least 6 weapons I cannot use.  The<br/>
&gt;quests<br/>
&gt;are easily doable for a group of my level or close (21st).  I can get no<br/>
&gt;decent weapons via quest that I can use except the Screaming Mace that I<br/>
&gt;did<br/>
&gt;9 levels ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Believe me if anyone can refute this and offer me a solution to where I<br/>
&gt;might find a better weapon obtainable I&#39;d be glad to hear it.  I get<br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt;tired of having my own guild members laugh, &quot;you still using that little<br/>
&gt;sticker?&quot;  I suppose I could buy a PGT, but at the 250pp they go for on<br/>
&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;it hardly seems justifiable.  Any suggestions out there?  I currently<br/>
&gt;own 4<br/>
&gt;magical piercing weapons (don&#39;t ask), and 2 magical 1HB, but only a<br/>
&gt;combine<br/>
&gt;Scimitar for 1HS.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; CONCLUSION<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some<br/>
&gt;items<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; can be. It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an<br/>
&gt;intuitive<br/>
&gt;feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses,<br/>
&gt;classes,<br/>
&gt;&gt; skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by<br/>
&gt;running<br/>
&gt;&gt; simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you<br/>
&gt;expect.<br/>
&gt;Then<br/>
&gt;&gt; you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real<br/>
&gt;world<br/>
&gt;&gt; usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use<br/>
&gt;this?<br/>
&gt;Is<br/>
&gt;&gt; there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you<br/>
&gt;made<br/>
&gt;&gt; the right decision.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This guy is like a god.  When I read his stuff, I get more<br/>
&gt;  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>
&gt;  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>
&gt;  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were<br/>
&gt;  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>
&gt;  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>
