<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002775525">No, PC healers cannot heal MOBS anymore.  They could many months ago, but a <br/>
patch changed that.  A druid CAN heal a monster but only under certain <br/>
special condition.  The monster has to be of anmimal type so the druid can <br/>
charm it.  A druid can heal his pet.  But in your case, the monster is <br/>
hitting you, so the monster wasn&#39;t a pet.<br/>
<br/>
I think your druid friend was telling you the truth, well at least the part <br/>
about some other healer type MOB nearby is healing your target.  Shaman type <br/>
MOB will heal his friends even though the fight was not close enough to draw <br/>
its attack.  As for his heal is not very good, it could be true.  Druid only <br/>
gets an upgrade of heal spell every 2 ranks. So maybe he was just a few <br/>
level short of getting his next upgrade and his previous heal spell (8 or 9 <br/>
levels ago) cannot keep up with the damage you are taking.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;      One question...can<br/>
&gt;druids, clerics, etc., or<br/>
&gt;those that heal, heal monsters<br/>
&gt;that they are fighting if they<br/>
&gt;have the monster targeted?  I<br/>
&gt;have never played a healer<br/>
&gt;type and was wondering if this<br/>
&gt;was the case.  Yesterday in<br/>
&gt;Permafrost I was grouped with<br/>
&gt;a druid that was supposed to<br/>
&gt;be healing me when I was<br/>
&gt;getting hurt, but for some<br/>
&gt;reason every time I asked for<br/>
&gt;a heal, the monster would get<br/>
&gt;more health and mine would<br/>
&gt;still go down.  The druids<br/>
&gt;explanation was that there<br/>
&gt;were other monsters of its<br/>
&gt;race healing it and the reason<br/>
&gt;mine was not healing fast is<br/>
&gt;because his heal did not work<br/>
&gt;very well.  Needless to say I<br/>
&gt;died and quickly ungrouped<br/>
&gt;from this person.  So is what<br/>
&gt;the druid said true?  Or am I<br/>
&gt;correct in my assumption that<br/>
&gt;the druid was healing the<br/>
&gt;monsters?<br/>
