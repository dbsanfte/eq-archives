<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091889270">next time you need to see invis with a pet caster around, ask them to cast<br/>
it on you. To my knowledge ALL pet casters get that spell. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, when do you actually need to see invis? The only situations I<br/>
can come up with is when the group is moving someplace and everyone is<br/>
invisible. Pet isn&#39;t going to last long in that situation. OR, fighting<br/>
invis mobs, in which case, if you are wasting a song on see invis, get out<br/>
of my group.<br/>

&gt; *sigh* Did Kenross get sold on ebay?  To say that the needed change to the<br/>
&gt; lvl 19 song (adding see invis) made the lvl 24 song pointless is about the<br/>
&gt; stupidest thing I have read on this or any list.   Next time you need to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>
&gt; when you pulse clouding to see invis.  Or maybe when you are fighting<br/>
invis<br/>
&gt; mobs in PoA or another zone and have to use your flute so your party can<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; the invis mob you are fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just leveled up to the point where he realized that while ideas<br/>
like the above look good in writing, in actual practice no one does<br/>
this. For any caster other than a hybrid, the mana to cast see invis at<br/>
L50 comes back faster than you can cast the spell.<br/>
