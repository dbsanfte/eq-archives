<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438740601">Well you clearly have excellent memory (and upgrade didn&#39;t help<br/>
surprisingly); and a decent video card (for EQ at least) - but of course the<br/>
videocard can&#39;t be an issue for the server select screen.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the problem is your hard disk.  Either you don&#39;t have a<br/>
hard disk - or perhaps it&#39;s severely fragmented - have you run defrag<br/>
lately?<br/>
<br/>
If you are good about maintenance it&#39;s probably a slow drive...  Your<br/>
process is a bit on the slower side (by new PC standards) but is reasonable<br/>
fast otherwise (again esp. for EQ).<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at HD issues...<br/>
