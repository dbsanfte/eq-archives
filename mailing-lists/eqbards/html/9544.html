&gt; &gt; I beginning to think there should be a level check on a critter when he dies<br/>
&gt; &gt; that his corpse disappears immediately if your level is more than a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount greater than the mob.  I was vehemently against this idea when it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; initially proposed by Verant.  Its better than making everything &#39;no drop&#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know about this. There&#39;s a ton of problems with this and it<br/>
&gt; would require changes Verant won&#39;t want to make. For one, they&#39;d have to<br/>
&gt; rethink their current &quot;everything about L18 attacks&quot; setup. If I&#39;m going<br/>
&gt; to have to fight green mobs 32 levels below mine, I better at least get<br/>
&gt; loot from them, no matter how pitiful. As well, what about necros<br/>
&gt; hunting for bone chips or druids hunting for bat wings?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;everything above level 18 attacks&quot; setup was supposedly<br/>
put in to stop high level people from &quot;safely&quot; camping a low<br/>
level named mob without worrying about clearing the area.  I<br/>
don&#39;t really see it working.  The two tactics I&#39;ve seen to get<br/>
around it are lulling/mesmerizing to break up the spawn.  And<br/>
the really lame tactic of just killing the named mob while<br/>
everything else beats on you, looting it, then zoning to get<br/>
rid of the rest.  I saw countless L20-30 people die in Cazic<br/>
due to two L45-50 idiots doing this for a couple hours with<br/>
the throne room Taes.<br/>
<br/>
They should&#39;ve just changed the AI so if you attack a named<br/>
mob, all the green stuff around it will attack you regardless<br/>
of level.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at least fits<br/>
&gt; in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare by any means<br/>
&gt; possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d probably cut the<br/>
&gt; spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still like my idea of loot-once-per-lifetime.  It lets you<br/>
keep items rare while keeping the mobs common.  It also stops<br/>
harvesting dead in its tracks.  The only really bad part is<br/>
that you can&#39;t continuously camp a mob until you get the item<br/>
you want, but then, that&#39;s really the root of all these<br/>
problems isn&#39;t it?<br/>
