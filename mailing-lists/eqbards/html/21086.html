I&#39;m amazed they could even find two testers.  They pay less at Verant, in<br/>
San Diego, than most companies here in Denver.  Our cost of living index is<br/>
much lower than San Diego.<br/>

could it be that they are understaffed like hundreds of other tech companies<br/>
in california?<br/>
guess what, it&#39;s easy to say we need 10 testers, it&#39;s another thing entirely<br/>
to hire 10<br/>
qualified people to be testers.<br/>
