<div id="ygrps-yiv-271587212">Little short story on my experiences with Shield of Songs spell, maybe youll get a kick out of it.<br/>
<br/>
One note before I forget. Shield of Songs has a GIGANTIC range. Test it out tell me what ya think.<br/>
<br/>
Island 4, Soul Tamer..etc island. My guild had around 45-50 people there( LOTS of fatty tanks included). So many people I had time to mess around a little. ANYWAYS, I had a couple tanks in my group so I tossed on the ole lute and starte chain casting SoS over and over and over when a tank started getting hit. After the 2nd or 3rd cast, Tuldar: LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br/>
<br/>
These horsies jumped all over me almost instantly. Well after that dead I loaded Song of Dawn ( lowers bard on the mobs agro list for those that dont know). Few horses get pulled( or split cant remember) In my infinite wisdome I try again ( this time from a farther range than before , see range note ubove) I chain cast it again once my warriors took a little damage. 3 horseys all over me like glue all 3 smacking me for 250 a shot, about 10  high levle ( some 60) warriors hitting, Taunting, making Rude gestures etc.. couldnt get them off me.  One horsey I got a couple-few pulses of Song Of Dawn off and it turned away for other vittems. GREAT thats only 2 horseys hitting me for around 250 heheh LOADING PLEASE WAIT. AAH I had a blast thought testing it out. I was screaming in guildchat next fight, WATCH I CAN TAUNT BETTER THAT YALL CAN! MUHAH... LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br/>
<br/>
Hope in not making my self sound like a bad bard or anything its just we had SO MANY people up there other than /assisting tactics really wasnt an issue yet so I had some leway(sp?)<br/>
<br/>
All in all I think this is a great song for alot of situations like in single group scenerios, cleric oom, chain cast that sucker with lute one ( this is if ya have a chanter doing crowd controll and not the bard) it would work wonders even at higher levels to save alot of healing mana or to give the cleric that extra second to get the heal off of that wizard thats about to die. Theres some good situations. I see its main effectiveness mainly only if your gonna chain sing it. At my levels weaving it every 3rd song instead of some other benaficial song really isnt worth it unless its a single mob thats going to take you A LONG time to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, can you say PL song? ( if ya dont wanna do the kill till almost death then charm for blurr tactic) get a wizard in group run into a bunch of orcs, weave SoS and cantana and have him area damage over and over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer, just my opinions here and I havn&#39;t really had much time to play with this song other than sky.<br/>
