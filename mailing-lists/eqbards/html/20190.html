<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876254868">Below is a copy of an email message I recently sent to Abashi concerning the<br/>
establishment of an official player&#39;s council.  I got Abashi&#39;s standard<br/>
autoreply message which said that, due to the amount of emails he gets<br/>
everyday, he would be more likely to respond to the issue if it was posted<br/>
on the Gameplay forum.  I am considering posting the message but before I<br/>
do, wanted to run it through you guys to get your opinion/ideas.  If you<br/>
have any recommended changes/new ideas let me know and I will modify the<br/>
message before posting it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Gordon,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, thanks for taking the time to read this email.  I realize you<br/>
&gt; get a lot of emails everyday and don&#39;t have the time to respond to all of<br/>
&gt; them.  I&#39;m hoping you can make an exception for this one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have an idea I would like to propose to Verant.  Someone may have<br/>
&gt; suggested this idea in the past but if so I&#39;m not aware if Verant has<br/>
&gt; stated an official position on it.  What I propose is that Verant set up<br/>
&gt; some type of official player&#39;s council.  This council could perform<br/>
&gt; several functions.  First, it could function as a focus group for game<br/>
&gt; related issues.  Verant could use these players as a sounding board for<br/>
&gt; potential changes to the game.  The council could also serve as a voice<br/>
&gt; for class concerns.  I&#39;ll use bards as an example.  For months bards have<br/>
&gt; been claiming that the Lullaby song is broken.  There have been numerous<br/>
&gt; posts and bumps on the Gameplay forum asking Verant to acknowledge the<br/>
&gt; song is broken and fix it.  Many bards are frustrated due to the perceived<br/>
&gt; lack of action on Verant&#39;s part.  However, if Verant informed the player&#39;s<br/>
&gt; council on the status of the fix (if there is one), then the bard<br/>
&gt; representatives can inform the bard community that Verant IS working on<br/>
&gt; the song and for them to remain patient.  This would go a long way in<br/>
&gt; reducing player dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is an example of how the council can be set up:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  The players get to choose who will represent them.  Each class gets<br/>
&gt; ten representatives.  The class fansite web boards will be used to vote on<br/>
&gt; the representatives.  For example, bards have The Concert Hall, rogues<br/>
&gt; have The Safehouse, etc.  The administrators for those sites would be<br/>
&gt; responsible for setting up a poll for each class to determine who they<br/>
&gt; want to represent them.  I think that it would be fairly easy for the<br/>
&gt; community of each class to come to a consensus on who they want.  My<br/>
&gt; primary character is a bard so I&#39;m most familiar with that community.<br/>
&gt; There are several well known bards who post on the Concert Hall board and<br/>
&gt; the eqbards mailing list.  These bards would be prime candidates as<br/>
&gt; official representatives for the class.  I think it is also safe to assume<br/>
&gt; that other classes have equivalent players.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)  Type of forum.  This could be set up as a moderated mailing list or a<br/>
&gt; secure message board on the Everquest website.  Either way, the only<br/>
&gt; people with access to the site are the player representatives and Verant<br/>
&gt; employees.  There would have to be a rule established that all discussion<br/>
&gt; between Verant and the representatives is considered confidential and not<br/>
&gt; for public release unless Verant grants permission.  Any player who<br/>
&gt; violates this rule is removed from the council and a replacement selected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This just covers the basic framework.  The details can get fleshed out<br/>
&gt; later if Verant thinks its a good idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you are well aware of, a lot of players are frustrated with Verant for<br/>
&gt; a perceived lack of customer service.  In my opinion, Verant can improve<br/>
&gt; their relationship with their player base by instituting an official<br/>
&gt; player&#39;s council.  This would go a long way in helping to prove that<br/>
&gt; Verant cares for the players.  Its a win-win situation for both sides that<br/>
&gt; can be easily implemented.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to consider this proposal.<br/>
