<div id="ygrps-yiv-347080220">You can also retarget your pet by pressing F1 twice. F1 will target you the <br/>
first press, then your pet the second press. I&#39;ve actually remapped the <br/>
&quot;target self&quot; key to one of the keypad keys so I don&#39;t have to reach all <br/>
the way up to the function keys.<br/>
<br/>
The macro targetting is definitely a good thing, but it&#39;s good to know this <br/>
as well.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Haven&#39;t posted in a while, but wanted to comment on charm macros.  Matt&#39;s<br/>
&gt;macro is good.  I will make a copy of it tonight.  Here it is again:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
&gt;/pet back off<br/>
&gt;/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
&gt;/pause 3<br/>
&gt;/pet attack<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In addition to the macro Matt has, I have one that also adds in /pet target<br/>
&gt;after /pet attack.  What /pet target does is retarget your pet so that if<br/>
&gt;you are charm kiting and you target another mob to get your charmed pet to<br/>
&gt;attack it, your original pet will be retargetted for recharms.  Those of us<br/>
&gt;that have recharmed the wrong mob by accident know that you end up with the<br/>
&gt;aggro of the original pet - not a good thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, good luck in your travels,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Charming in a group is the best thing to do on a 2 pull even if there is a<br/>
&gt;chanter.  Once you get good, the mob will be doing 90% of its damage on the<br/>
&gt;party&#39;s main target, 10% on you.  Thats a great tradeoff to 0-10% damage<br/>
&gt;done to chanter/healer and mana spent mezzing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is my &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey, it works great.  Rule 1, let the group know<br/>
&gt;what you&#39;re doing, and make sure its ok with the enchanter.  Most are happy<br/>
&gt;for the mana you save them.  Type A enchanters will not be happy, so then<br/>
&gt;just let them mez the mob...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok 2 Pull comes, assist the puller and find out what mob he is killing.<br/>
&gt;Target the non targeted mob and hit charm, once it sticks (very low resists<br/>
&gt;if you have a good CHA) hit the &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once you get this down its easy to weave 2 other songs while doing this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
&gt;/pet back off<br/>
&gt;/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
&gt;/pause 3<br/>
&gt;/pet attack<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The pet back off is not necesaary, but seems to help.  Sometimes charms mobs<br/>
&gt;will still attack other party members or pets, the pet back off will prevent<br/>
&gt;this.  It also lets the party know what you have charmed, since your pet<br/>
&gt;will say something.  THe down side is the second or so of melee you lose<br/>
&gt;from your pet while he is waiting for the attack command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a side note, /pet back off, is probably the best mem blur spell in the<br/>
&gt;game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
