<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591185048">Sorry, didn&#39;t get back to email until this afternoon. This is a good<br/>
explanation of my point, and no it was not directed at Shada. As a<br/>
further post to the list said, other than easy camps like the karnors<br/>
zone line, high level play in Kunark requires near optimum groups unless<br/>
you want to spend a lot of time either evacing or doing CR, and in those<br/>
groups, the only effective way to play our class is reduced to being a<br/>
mana/hp battery. Even then, the group _will_ have an enchanter, and<br/>
clarity/clarity2 is enough that a bard becomes an expendable luxury<br/>
who&#39;s spot could easily be filled by someone who would make the group<br/>
more effective. I had great hopes that their reevaluation of lullaby<br/>
might let bards actually be an alternative to the enchanter, without<br/>
which most groups wont go near places like Howling Stones or deep in<br/>
Sebilis, but as usual Verant doesn&#39;t want to give us that kind of power,<br/>
leaving us ineffective there, as much as we are ineffective at slowing<br/>
mobs.<br/>

&gt; I think the problem is that most of us have already re-evaluated our<br/>
&gt; playlists and determined that in 95% off all balanced groups, the most<br/>
&gt; effective thing you can do is be a mana/hp battery. The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>
&gt; song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>
&gt; not just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>
&gt; meleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>
&gt; outcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>
&gt; a movie.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, we still shine in broken, unbalanced groups, but those very same<br/>
&gt; groups can&#39;t really &quot;get anything done&quot; in kunark. At least not when you<br/>
&gt; compare them to groups that are balanced.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, yeah. It&#39;s their world. They make the rules. This doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
&gt; people don&#39;t have the right to tell them that the rules they have made for<br/>
&gt; the bard class squeeze the fun out of it at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play<br/>
&gt; &gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case<br/>
&gt; &gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades<br/>
&gt; &gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just<br/>
&gt; &gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me<br/>
&gt; &gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Goodness, people bitch way too much about VI.  What part of,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in our world now&quot; did you people not understand?  Was that not<br/>
&gt; &gt; a clue<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you started playing this game?  Max haste was a known bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERYONE was exploiting.  They fixed it, get over it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>
