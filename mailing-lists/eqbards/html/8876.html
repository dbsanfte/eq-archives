&gt; I have never used that song on myself, but I used yesterday many times on <br/>
&gt; some Sol Mage (trying to get my lambent boots) and it works.  I used it to <br/>
&gt; pull them by stunning them first, and I run back to my safe spot invis and <br/>
&gt; wait for it to come.  I also used it to interrupt his spells.  I also used <br/>
&gt; it at Lower Guk a few days ago (Friday night I think) against Zol and Dar <br/>
&gt; ghoul frogloks, it works well.  I can hold them for like minutes so our <br/>
&gt; group could break up the camp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I think they Up&#39;ed the mob resist rate.  Not the resist messages, <br/>
&gt; but the way that they break the trance even when the song went thru.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is what I thought at first - that the mobs were instantly<br/>
breaking out of the song effect.  However, if you carefully<br/>
observe how many Strikes it takes to successfully mesmerize a<br/>
mob, compared to how many Strikes it takes to keep it<br/>
mesmerized, it&#39;s obvious that this isn&#39;t what&#39;s going on.  If<br/>
it were a tweak with the rate they broke out of the effect,<br/>
they should be &quot;immediately breaking out&quot; as often with<br/>
subsequent Strikes as with the initial ones.  That isn&#39;t the<br/>
case.  Once you successfully get Strike to stick, it&#39;s almost<br/>
trivial to keep it mesmerized - basically if it isn&#39;t<br/>
resisted, the Strike gets &quot;refreshed,&quot; usually for another<br/>
three pulses.  Aside from resists, it virtually never fails in<br/>
this manner if you&#39;re Striking a mesmerized mob.  The bug only<br/>
seems to happen if you&#39;re trying to Strike a non-mesmerized<br/>
mob.<br/>
<br/>
If you give me a situation where three mobs my level start off<br/>
mesmerized, I can pretty much hold all three of them with this<br/>
song indefinitely by Striking them one after another.  But if<br/>
you give me three unmesmerized mobs, I&#39;ll probably have to<br/>
Strike the first one 5-7 times before one finally &quot;sticks.&quot;<br/>
Only then can I move on to trying to get one to stick to the<br/>
second, which means another 5-7 tries while keeping the first<br/>
one refreshed.  By this time my cleric is dead from having the<br/>
2 other mobs beating on him while I futzed around with the<br/>
first one.  That is what makes this song broken and virtually<br/>
useless.  Given the high &quot;false failure&quot; rate, I found it more<br/>
effective to just charm the thing and remove its damage from<br/>
the fight on the first try.<br/>

him.<br/>
