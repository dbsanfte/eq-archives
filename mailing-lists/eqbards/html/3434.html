While in Runnyeye fighting Evil Eyes, in a group that was decently class <br/>
balanced, we found that it was more effective for thr evil battles for me to <br/>
use a drum and raise the party&#39;s magic resistance significantly instead of <br/>
diving into melee. It will be a judgement call depending on the group <br/>
dynamics and the enemies you take on.<br/>
