&gt; suddenly its a whopping<br/>
&gt; 40% change.  It seems from the mechanics that critters have an Offensive<br/>

&gt; 300 has maximum attack value of 300+RND vs your AC.  This effectively makes<br/>
&gt; its attacks your AC (500) - its OB (300) crossreferenced vs RND to determine<br/>
&gt; hit and damage.  Hence going from 500 - 460 whould have an enormous effect<br/>
&gt; on combat outcome.  This would also explain why creatures far lower in level<br/>

it&#39;s not a straight subtraction, rather it&#39;s curved near the<br/>
extremes.<br/>
