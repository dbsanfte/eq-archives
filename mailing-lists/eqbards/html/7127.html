<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983441050">I too have recently been hunting Aviaks in South K.  I have been in several<br/>
groups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights.  While I have never grouped<br/>
with a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting in a group of 2) with<br/>
several different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>
and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have had a problem that I as a<br/>
bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>
once I would be the one ending battle with most of my health, while my<br/>
partner was near death.  This is nice but unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>
would have a terrible time trying to get my share of dammage.  I think that<br/>
some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a lot of resists from<br/>
Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I think that there is some<br/>
other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>
<br/>
On a seperate note,  I did group with 2 other bards in unrest once.  WOW...<br/>
that was cool, and I can attribute not getting all the attention, due to<br/>
multiple bards.  What fun.  If we had one more bard we could have been the<br/>
Beatles :)  I also dont think I have ever seen Sooo many icons for Buffs on<br/>
my screen :)<br/>

Last night, at the suggestion of a few people from this list, I ventured for<br/>
the first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I had been in South Karana<br/>
before to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had never fought anything<br/>
there.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th level players, four of<br/>
which were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>
avoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that she would sing the level<br/>
25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and anything else appropriate.<br/>
We were camping at the top of the village where avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>
and darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with this group for almost<br/>
two hours.  Me and the other bard were the default tanks.  For the first<br/>
time in a long time, I was no longer the center of attention.  In almost<br/>
every fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get the aviaks initial<br/>
attention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the aviak, they often found<br/>
themselves the center of attention.  I, on the other hand, almost never got<br/>
attacked the entire night.  The most health I ever dropped to was about 50%.<br/>
This happened when an avocet spawned while we were in the process of<br/>
fighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots of fun.  The lower<br/>
level bard also has the luxury of not having to worry too much about getting<br/>
continually whacked on.  <br/>
