&gt; Subject: RE: Clerics<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually I play a cleric and a bard as well.  Several of the bard/rogue<br/>
&gt; items are or already have been realigned to be rogue only due to rogue<br/>
&gt; complaints.  And yes the primarily found Cleric weapon is Cleric/Paladin<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there are many special weapons easily obtainable for clerics like the<br/>
&gt; Bloodforge hammer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there are many special weapons a Bard can use.<br/>
<br/>
You are wrong if you think there are less Bard-only equipment than<br/>
Cleric-only equipment.  And Bards hve a much larger selection of weapons to<br/>
choose from that clerics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; High elves and halflings are the low for cleric hitpoints, half-elves and<br/>
&gt; humans are the high for bard hitpoints.  Our dwarf cleric has near 400hp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my 337 and he is 2 levels below me with no points added to stamina and no<br/>
&gt; boosting items (just like me).  His AC is also 30 points higher since his<br/>
&gt; strength is 100+ with minimal point investment.  Maybe clerics in general<br/>
&gt; only make slightly better or equal tanks to us, but dwarf clerics<br/>
 </span></blockquote>definitely<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make better tanks than any bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see your real problem.  You are only level 16 and the cleric is 14.  You<br/>
have no idea how things happen work out later on.  At higher levels Clerics<br/>
are just not melee capable.  Clerics are more efficeint when they meditate<br/>
in battle.  At your low levels, clerics do make decent tanks.  But this<br/>
ability goes away at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In addition his full suit of armor cost less than 150pp.  I on the other<br/>
&gt; hand have one piece alone that cost me that much (silvered bracer).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This makes no sense at all.  You could equip yourself very similar to the<br/>
Dwarf for around the same prices.  But just because you bought one piece of<br/>
rare equipment doesn&#39;t mean that bards are worse off.<br/>
<br/>
My cleric just paid 800pp for a CG Shield.  I also paid 600pp for two +WIS<br/>
rings.  And around 100pp for some earrings.</div>
