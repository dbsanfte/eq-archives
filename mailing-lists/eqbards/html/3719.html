<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137574966">The problem with this is that it is another generalization granted there are<br/>
a lot of kewldudes, and a lot of them are teenagers but not all of them<br/>
there are some adults that fit into that category. The only problem with<br/>
that is some more mature teenagers can&#39;t give their age out until you group<br/>
with the same people a couple of times. A lot of friends I&#39;ve made have been<br/>
surprised to find out that I to was a teenager. I try to keep an open mind<br/>
and give everybody a chanch or two.<br/>

&gt;Even though my guild does not have a large amount of bards... 4 or 5 i<br/>
&gt;think, the one thing I enjoy the most is the maturity all of our members<br/>
&gt;have.  Most of them are 18-40s resulting in players with more mental<br/>
&gt;abilities than all of the kewldewds combined... which still isnt saying<br/>

&gt;&gt; Only 26 here, but one thing I have noticed is that<br/>
&gt;&gt; bards genrally are more mature players and better<br/>
&gt;&gt; role-players than most other classes.  Granted this is<br/>
&gt;&gt; a genralization, but we are not the power gamer type<br/>
&gt;&gt; character, we are the group type, the glue type.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; like that.  One reason I don&#39;t want other races to<br/>
&gt;&gt; have bards is because I also like being rare.  In my<br/>
&gt;&gt; guild of 40, I&#39;m one of two.  I like that :)<br/>
