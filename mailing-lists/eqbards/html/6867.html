<b>Subject:</b> RE: Medium Bronze Armor (Spoiler) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-245172138">This was a topic a long time ago when we were debating if bards should wear<br/>
plate.  The theory is that stronger/thicker armor types may deflect a<br/>
portion of the blow.  For example, the random generator decides you will<br/>
take 50 points of damage from a hit.  The results would be something like<br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
Type		Damage<br/>
No armor	50<br/>
Leather		45<br/>
Banded 	40<br/>
Bronze		35<br/>
Steel		30<br/>
<br/>
I just made these up as an example.  Another theory is that the type of<br/>
armor has no impact whatsoever.  In this case, the only thing that is<br/>
important is your AC.  A higher AC would mean a less chance of getting hit.<br/>
If you do get hit, using the previous example, you would take 50 damage even<br/>
if you were wearing steel plate.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what the correct answer is but since I have enough STR to<br/>
wear full bronze, its a moot point for me.  I would like to get confirmation<br/>
but doubt it will ever happen.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; Wasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>
&gt; &gt; different armor types provided different protection, independent of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; AC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I need some clarification on this one!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got a bunch of bronze armor stacked up in the bank that I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; wearing because the items that it replaces have magical bonuses (barbed<br/>
&gt; leggings and barbed arms for a +2 to DEX and to AGI), Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>
&gt; etc.  The weight increase vs. the minimal AC increase has kept me in a mix<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; magic/banded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Am I to understand that putting on a bunch of bronze for an AC increase of<br/>
&gt; around 8 or 10 pts is going to make a big big difference in mob damage?<br/>
