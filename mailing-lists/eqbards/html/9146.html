<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737203721">I have been told that this is a common method by high level characters to<br/>
powerlevel lower level characters.  Like you said, if the mob gives the<br/>
higher level character experience, the lower level character will gone none.<br/>
If the mob does not give the higher level character experiece, the lower<br/>
level one character will get it all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I dunno bout this, when I was 30 I grouped with a 47 ranger and I got<br/>
&gt; exp....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But did he gain experience for the same mobs?  I&#39;ve had similar<br/>
&gt; situations, where grouping with a 48 paladin at 27 earned me no<br/>
&gt; experience, but then he was still gaining experience for the things we<br/>
&gt; were after, so perhaps you do earn experience grouped in that manner if<br/>
&gt; the higher levelled characters cannot.<br/>
