 </span></blockquote>Yup. And it&#39;s really sad it becomes useless at high levels. For those<br/>
who don&#39;t know, Verant has now made it so you can&#39;t charm a creature<br/>
over L38 (the creature&#39;s level) <br/>
<br/>
I understand that this change was put in because some clever enchanter<br/>
figured out that he could charm powerful mobs onto even more powerful<br/>
mobs, the when the targer mob killed the charmed one, clear it&#39;s hate<br/>
list with memory blur and repeat. I guess our song got caught in the<br/>
change because it shares the code, even though there&#39;s no way we could<br/>
have used a similar tactic.<br/>
