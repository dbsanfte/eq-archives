<div id="ygrps-yiv-190951232">I also just hit 20 and decided to give Lake Rathe a try. Mind you I have not<br/>
actually hunted anything yet, but from a brief swim around the lake it<br/>
seemed as though there would be plenty to hunt and hopefully I will find<br/>
some pickup groups.<br/>

&gt; This has been asked over and over I&#39;m sure but..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a level 20 bard, where is a good place to go? I know<br/>
&gt; all about the level chart on AllaKazam&#39;s page, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; found it to be seriously flawed so I don&#39;t follow it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS: Maybe we could come up with a list or chart for<br/>
&gt; bards between all of us..<br/>
