<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289442861">Wow, I really am beginning to feel like the only person left playing EQ who<br/>
doesn&#39;t kill druids, treants, guards, dwarves at the docks, gnomes, etc...<br/>
Doesn&#39;t anyone care about faction anymore?  Or is it just players don&#39;t want<br/>
to take risks anymore...<br/>
<br/>
As for hill giants, I&#39;ve found Rathe Mountains on the Prexus server to be<br/>
good at just about ANY time of the day.  They spawn there like the gnolls in<br/>
BB (well, maybe not quite that many...).  Especially if you get a party<br/>
together and go around killing all the basilisks, lizards, giant skeletons,<br/>
cyclops, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I personally find charming and killing HG&#39;s to be EXTREMELY dull and boring,<br/>
however.  Last night my party ventured into the pool room at Sol B and my<br/>
brother (a druid) and I took over the responsibility of pulling (and<br/>
learning the joint).  First pull yielded one shaman... not a problem.<br/>
Second yielded 2 greater kobolds and a shaman (ouch!).  I shouted at the<br/>
party not to run and proceeded to charm one of the 2 greater kobolds and<br/>
sent it after the other.  By the time the party was done with the shaman, I<br/>
was almost done with one of the 2 greater kobolds.  It was easy to finish<br/>
off the other.  I need about 2 greater heals in between charms (because of<br/>
resists), but I played a little clarity and 2 minutes later we were pulling<br/>
again.  I learned that there is a 25 minute spawn cycle to the greater<br/>
kobolds and a full party of mid to high 30 can handle the place REAL easy<br/>
with a bard.  We took every single kobold out in the whole section up by the<br/>
pool room and held it all night...  A combination of lament and charm<br/>
together worked incredible.<br/>
<br/>
One note though, one of the shamans Dotted one of the ones that I was<br/>
charming once accidentally.  Every single time I charmed it, I had to tell<br/>
it to back off in order to get it to stop from beating on the shaman...  Had<br/>
to tell them all to leave the one beating on me alone and pretend it is a<br/>
pet.  (1 mage, 2 shamans all with pets... I was joking with them that my pet<br/>
did more damage then any of the others easily! LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Now isn&#39;t it a lot more fun using the tools at our disposal to clear a<br/>
dungeon then to stand around watching a couple of HG&#39;s beat on each other?<br/>
Maybe it is just me...<br/>
<br/>
My only worry now is there was a GM and a Guide standing there watching us<br/>
for about 10 minutes... Hope they don&#39;t think we did it too easy.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to get nerfed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  With the way I use charm or bellow, I wouldn&#39;t be effected in the<br/>
slightest by a reduction in range...  even fighting HG&#39;s. :-)<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I made level 31 the other day, and a bubble of that exp was made killing<br/>
&gt; Giants in N Karana, I think I&#39;ve got the art of charming mastered but I<br/>
&gt; just wanted to see if there is anything else I could do to improve things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off I equip anything that gives +cha (not alot at the moment), I<br/>
&gt; currently have Full Lambent (+10 Cha total) aswell as a Mask of Deception<br/>
&gt; (+13 Cha) and a +3 Cha necklace, this gives me Cha of roughly 111 (base<br/>
&gt; 85), which is not bad but I&#39;m saving for some REALLY good cha jewellery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead of equipping my Crude Stein I equip my MM Drums and start selo. I<br/>
&gt; do an /Ooc Anyone see any Giants? And if I&#39;m in lucky I go and pull the<br/>
&gt; giant using Charm, then Start up Selo again and run around looking for<br/>
&gt; another Giant, in the mean time if I can&#39;t find another Giant I make the<br/>
&gt; giant kill guards or Griffennes/Griffons. Whilst charming I run from my<br/>
&gt; target (backwards) and stop selo and play Charm, if it&#39;s a succeed I turn<br/>
&gt; the giant onto my target then I fire Selo&#39;s up again. I start running<br/>
&gt; backwards again(I can outrun giants running backwards). I keep<br/>
&gt; backing away<br/>
&gt; and charming until the giant has killed the mob I set him on. I then run a<br/>
&gt; distance away from the dead corpse, charm the giant. Sit him down and go<br/>
&gt; loot, If I&#39;m lucky I find another giant that I can use to kill my first<br/>
&gt; giant and so on until I get bored and zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s quite scary having 2 giants on you and it&#39;s easy to make a<br/>
&gt; mistake and<br/>
&gt; get killed. 2 Giants pounding on you is not nice, especially if Selo&#39;s has<br/>
&gt; dropped. I managed to not get killed whilst charming and I only zoned once<br/>
&gt; (made giant attack a druid and the lot came after me). I did however die<br/>
&gt; twice (thanks Grimfeather for one and all the guards at the stone bridge<br/>
&gt; for the other) this kinda pissed me off cos I lost alot of hard earned exp<br/>
&gt; from silly mistakes (mind you having grimfeather beat on you<br/>
&gt; whilst looting<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a mistake). Even with Selo&#39;s a my MM drums equipped I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t outrun<br/>
&gt; him. Lucky I got good exp rez&#39;s both times and only lost 1/4 bub exp in<br/>
&gt; total.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hill Giants seem to be quite rare so it can get boring in N Karana, and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s always f***ing raining in that zone too I&#39;ve thought about trying<br/>
&gt; Oasis but the dunes etc put me off and the giants are almost as rare at<br/>
&gt; least there is no Grimfeather in the zone (aka death). And the zone is<br/>
&gt; smaller which is easier to hunt in, also the people usually<br/>
&gt; /shout Giant to<br/>
&gt; Dock etc......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, enough of my rabbling, I&#39;m really just interested in some comments,<br/>
&gt; suggestions or feedback with regard to my charming methods and places to<br/>
&gt; hunt that are good for charming.........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many Thanks<br/>
