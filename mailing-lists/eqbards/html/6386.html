<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831519041">A high-level mage in my guild told me that (at least on The Rathe) sometimes<br/>
high-level folks inside the castle start trains on purpose to get rid of all<br/>
the folks outside (and to reduce lag I guess).  Looks like it&#39;ll be a<br/>
helluva long time before I go there then :o)~<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The character of Mistmoore depends a large part on what the<br/>
&gt;other people in there are doing.  Sometimes everyone is good<br/>
&gt;about keeping fights localized in their area and announcing<br/>
&gt;trains.  I&#39;ve made nearly a level in a night playing in<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore under these circumstances, and the action was<br/>
&gt;nonstop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other times one or more groups are really rude and pull stuff<br/>
&gt;deep from the castle to the zone or don&#39;t announce their<br/>
&gt;constant trains.  I&#39;ve fought one familiar, then spent the<br/>
&gt;next half hour keeping my group invisible waiting for the<br/>
&gt;train to dissipate, kill another familiar, spend another half<br/>
&gt;hour waiting for another train to leave, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;re clearing out yard trash, there is absolutely no<br/>
&gt;reason you should ever see the Will Sapper and Soul<br/>
&gt;Seductress.  There are several spots near the zone that are<br/>
&gt;out of the path of trains.  Find them and work from there.  If<br/>
&gt;the trains are just too frequent, then there are some idiots<br/>
&gt;in the zone - leave and try again another night.<br/>
