<b>Subject:</b> OFF TOPIC:  Bards and Asherons Call <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-668656724">i do not want this to turn into a discussion i just wanted to inform people that with the public release of Asherons Call a mailing list has been set up for the bards of that world  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ACBards@onelist.com">ACBards@onelist.com</a>  the problem is there is no bard class in Asherons Call.  So in Beta Testing it has become a Roleplaying issue and not a class issue.  You can sign up for the list at www.onelist.com<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your patience<br/>
