site and the zone to the live side of Lower Guk.  It&#39;s usually<br/>
full of shin warriors and knights, nok and tal shamen, and<br/>
occasionally a tsu.  The noks turned green a while back, but<br/>
the shin knights were blue/green to me at 39 (and I saw a blue<br/>
one last night at 40).  It&#39;s a great place to fight if<br/>
&quot;everything else is camped,&quot; since AFAIK there are no special<br/>
mobs here so nobody camps it.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people going to the live side of LG zone into the<br/>
dead side first, swim up the waterfall, zone back into UG<br/>
(around the ancient croc area), then to the zone to the live<br/>
side of LG.  They take this roundabout route precisely to<br/>
avoid all these high level frogs on UG.<br/>

&gt; Greaves and Shin Gauntlets drop and can a humble 28th level bardess please<br/>
&gt; loot them for a quest?&quot;  The response was the they dropped &quot;Too damned<br/>
&gt; often&quot; and that I should have one of each in around an hour.  So I sat in LG<br/>

either.  You go a little further into the dead side to the<br/>
bedroom, then hug the right wall.  You&#39;ll run into several<br/>
vampire bats and giant black widows, but they shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
problem for a group in the low 30s (they seem to be very<br/>
susceptible to charm).  When the twisty passageway opens up to<br/>
a room with a door on the right side, that&#39;s where the basalt<br/>
gargoyles appear.  You can set up in the spider room (you&#39;ll<br/>
see why it&#39;s called that when you get there if it hasn&#39;t been<br/>
cleared :) and pull bats, spiders, and gargoyles (gargs may be<br/>
a bit tough for a low 30s group).  Everything here tends to<br/>
come in groups, so use Lament, Lullaby, charm, and Pixie<br/>
Strike liberally.  I prefer charm since it helps reduce<br/>
downtime.  This area is safe from the inevitable GIBs trains<br/>
(greater ice bones).<br/>
<br/>
If you hug the zone, just be wary of these trains.<br/>
