<div id="ygrps-yiv-389842758">Yup, same happened to us with the Ilis and Krup (do they make coffee) frogs.<br/>
We were fighting just at the entrance with a puller and all of a sudden<br/>
these Really Mean Frogs kept popping up.  Managed to kill 2 of them and get<br/>
a cleric camped at least.  But we were wondering what happened, glad we<br/>
figured it out :-)<br/>

		&gt; When we broke in, we cleared to the first bridge and were<br/>
fighting a froog<br/>

nowhere. He got<br/>

another, and another<br/>

to camp out,<br/>

what causes these<br/>
		&gt; Shrooms to agro?  This is the second time I have seen this<br/>
in this same spot<br/>
		&gt; with about the same results. And we were careful not to<br/>
use an AE - just<br/>
		&gt; doing the normal kill froog thing.  Anyone know?  Anyone<br/>
been to the lower<br/>
		&gt; levels in Seb?<br/>
<br/>
		A very similar thing happened to us at the bridge area both<br/>
yesterday<br/>
		and the day before but in our case it was ilis and krup<br/>
frogs that<br/>
		popped in. They obviously broke something when they fixed<br/>
the various<br/>
		pathing exploits people found in there in the last patch,<br/>
because we&#39;d<br/>
		been fighting there many times before the patch without this<br/>
happening.<br/>
		Of course, because this bug in no way benefits players,<br/>
don&#39;t hold your<br/>
		breath waiting for it to be fixed.<br/>
