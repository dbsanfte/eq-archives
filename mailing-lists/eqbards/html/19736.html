 </span></blockquote>well that&#39;s in your opinion.  have you played both bard and necro through<br/>
different levels?  if not, then it&#39;s hard to say.  for example, i&#39;ve played a druid<br/>
thru 40 levels (the other soloable class), and i think druids are reasonably<br/>
balanced at this point.  i was never able to kite reds or do anything ridiculous<br/>
like that.  and there was always a lot of downtime due to medding.  and they<br/>
aren&#39;t as useful in a dungeon setting as some other classes.  i actually think<br/>
that verant has done a reasonably good job at balancing the classes.  necros,<br/>
for example, while pretty damn good at combat, need a pet, which takes half<br/>
their experience.  also, they are kos in a LOT of places, limiting who they can<br/>
sell to and where they can travel.</div>
