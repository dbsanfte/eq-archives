<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-336224582">Ok, this is completely off topic BUT I need your help.  My guild is<br/>
doing a joint guild event in South Karana sometime in the near future<br/>
(with 5 other guilds).  I, being a fun loving party bard, have been<br/>
appointed to the &quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very<br/>
creative today and I&#39;m fresh out of new and amusing ideas.  I want to<br/>
try to do something fun that isn&#39;t the same old same old.  I figure the<br/>
best place to go for some ideas would be here!  The home of the fun<br/>
loving, party enhancing, entertaining bard.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you ideas in advance :)<br/>
