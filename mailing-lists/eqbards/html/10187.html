<div id="ygrps-yiv-411538675">My opinion is that what you&#39;re doing is a noble and interesting experiement<br/>
and completely centered in the Role Playing (RP) of EverQuest.  There is<br/>
absolutely nothing wrong with the way that you have acquired your equipment.<br/>
My first reaction to buying Lambent items is &quot;Hey, screw that.  Fight/quest<br/>
for them and wait to level 25ish to see your first piece like the rest of<br/>
us.&quot;  However, upon reflection, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly right.  I mean,<br/>
if you&#39;re a merchant and barterer by trade, then it&#39;s your RPing<br/>
responsibility to trade up for items.  10pp for a bronze BP yields 45pp,<br/>
40pp buys you a Dragoon Dirk in Crushbone that you sell for 55pp in<br/>
Freeport, etc. etc.  Ultimately it&#39;s &quot;Nice Item of the Winter Winds&quot; or<br/>
somesuch traded for Lambent boots.  You COULD achieve all of this without<br/>
ever even hitting level 2.  Is that right or wrong?  Dunno.  It&#39;s<br/>
subjective.  It&#39;s the way that you choose to play the game.  Personally I<br/>
LIKE kicking the snot out of an Elite Goblin and tearing the Icy Greaves off<br/>
of his cold green legs, venturing to Lower Guk and braving things many<br/>
levels above me to get the Shin Greaves and then getting some Lambent<br/>
Greaves that are MINE.  When people ask me if I want to sell them I just<br/>
think &quot;Yeah, RIGHT.&quot; because I worked hard for them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really just how you choose to play the game.  I have a friend that is a<br/>
tradesman like this.  Got a bard to level 10 and is just holding there,<br/>
trading, trading, trading.  Runs all over the world trading but not<br/>
fighting.  But as long as he&#39;s having fun, then he&#39;s getting his money&#39;s<br/>
worth out of EQ.  Who am I to say he&#39;s playing the game &quot;wrong&quot;?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rdparker@...">rdparker@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off I would like to introduce myself. I play Galeras, wood<br/>
&gt; elf bard, on<br/>
&gt; E&#39;ci. If you examine my character you will see something like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hail, I am Galeras, merchant and bard, lover of fine wine and women.<br/>
&gt; I grew up poor but do not intend to die that way. Some day I will<br/>
&gt; live in the<br/>
&gt; highest trees of Kelethin where only the wealthy abide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish Verant gave you more room. Anyway...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started this character with a simple RP idea in mind, to play a<br/>
&gt; character<br/>
&gt; that was not twinked and had a strong desire to become rich. I<br/>
&gt; should mention<br/>
&gt; that I started Galeras on a server where I have no other<br/>
&gt; characters and no<br/>
&gt; friends to &quot;help&quot;. I have a few goals along the way for him, that I feel<br/>
&gt; define &quot;rich&quot; and I use as milestones in my RP experiment. The<br/>
&gt; first of which<br/>
&gt; was to be in full bronze by level 8. A goal which I achieved last<br/>
&gt; week after<br/>
&gt; almost 4 days of /played time. In addition to the bronze I have a<br/>
&gt; shiny brass<br/>
&gt; shield, mino axe, tentacle whip, dwarven tunic and a few other things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I am sure many people will wonder how one can do this without<br/>
&gt; twinking.<br/>
&gt; Let me just tell you how I began. I really don&#39;t want a lot of<br/>
&gt; people doing<br/>
&gt; this. Believe it or not I hate twinked characters with items out<br/>
&gt; of their reach.<br/>
&gt; Actually I love to see an orc or goblin kill a twink in full rubicite.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did the Felewithe mail run twice to get my first song. Then I basically<br/>
&gt; quested and killed things until level 5. By level 5 I probably<br/>
&gt; had made about<br/>
&gt; 20pp. Most of this was done by trading. I am after all a merchant<br/>
&gt; & bard. At<br/>
&gt; level 5 I decided to travel, one of my favorite passtimes. So, I<br/>
&gt; picked up a<br/>
&gt; few passengers that wanted to travel with me and I went to<br/>
&gt; Rivervale. (I am<br/>
&gt; constantly helping others travel, find their corpses, etc. One of<br/>
&gt; the reasons<br/>
&gt; I chose a bard for my experiment. They have many ways to help<br/>
&gt; others.) I was<br/>
&gt; hoping to find a Blackened Iron Medallion at a good price that I<br/>
&gt; could sell<br/>
&gt; for a profit. Instead I saw a medium bronze breastplate for 10pp.<br/>
&gt; I bought it<br/>
&gt; and sold it in the commons for 45pp.  Anyway you no doubt get the<br/>
&gt; idea of how I<br/>
&gt; got to where I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My questions are these:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this<br/>
&gt; character.  And, I<br/>
&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent<br/>
&gt; posts. Will I<br/>
&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
