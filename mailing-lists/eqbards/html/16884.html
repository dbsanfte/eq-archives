<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree it looks like there wasn&#39;t much thought put into some of these.<br/>
<br/>
Can we say &quot;Desperate for ideas&quot;?  Thought we could ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think we should make our song suggestions to GZ REALLY good.  Because my<br/>
guess is he&#39;s gonna do basically whatever we give him (with a tweak here or<br/>
there).  I know my creative ideas are pretty much strained when trying to<br/>
think of NEW things to do with a bard song.  I&#39;m SURE his are, he has to<br/>
come up with new spells for 9 classes ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some of these songs are ridiculous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 51:<br/>
&gt; - Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding -<br/>
&gt; decrease AC from 16 to 18; Decrease Attack Speed between 30% to 35%;<br/>
&gt; Decrease Movement between 52% and 61%; Decrease AGI from 45 to 50<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They forgot to add INCREASE resist rate by 90%. Does anyone think this<br/>
song<br/>
&gt; will EVER stick?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 54:<br/>
&gt; - Selo&#39;s Assonait Strane -<br/>
&gt; Decrease movement between 43% and 45%; Decrease Attack Speed for between<br/>
23%<br/>
&gt; to 25%<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Um, Didn&#39;t they just give us a song that was better in every way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Compare<br/>
&gt; ===============================<br/>
&gt; Movement Debuf:     52% (Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding) vs 43% (Selo&#39;s Assonait<br/>
&gt; Strane)<br/>
&gt; Attack Speed Debuf: 30% (Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding) vs 23% (Selo&#39;s Assonait<br/>
&gt; Strane)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If they expect Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding to ever stick, why give us this<br/>
&gt; completely useless song? Is there ever a situation where we would not want<br/>
&gt; the -16 ac or -45 agi?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 57:<br/>
&gt; - McVaxius&#39; Rousing X -<br/>
&gt; Increase Attack Speed for Between 21% to 22%; Strength - Unknown formula;<br/>
&gt; Increase ATK from 13 to 14; Damage shield by 8<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmmm, I&#39;m not level 50 yet, so I don&#39;t know how good Verses of Victory is,<br/>
&gt; but it seems like it would be a better choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Compare:<br/>
&gt; ==============================<br/>
&gt; Attack Speed Buff: 21% (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs 25% (Verses of Victory)<br/>
&gt; Str Buff:          + x (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs +30 (Verses of Victory)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hard to judge without seeing the exact str buff of McVaxius&#39; but if it<br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; at least 18, then it isn&#39;t competitive with VoV. Not to mention that ViV<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; +20 ac and +30 agi (to balance with a rather meager 8 damage shield)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 58:<br/>
&gt; - Niv&#39;s Harmonic X -<br/>
&gt; Increase AC by 24<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boring? Guardian Rythmns at level 17 is +3 ac (sans drum), at level 36 is<br/>
+6<br/>
&gt; ac (sans drum). I don&#39;t have figures on level 50, but we can probably<br/>
&gt; reasonably extrapolate the ac to be +9 (sans drum). Now I ask you, is +11<br/>
ac<br/>
&gt; worth giving up +30 vs magic?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 59:<br/>
&gt; - Solon&#39;s Charsimatic Concord -<br/>
&gt; Increase Charisma by 45<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This seems a bit weak also, given that for all intensive purposes, only<br/>
&gt; bards will benefit from this in combat (most enchanters have thier cha in<br/>
&gt; the 180s-200s at level 50). Seeing as how we can&#39;t charm mobs above level<br/>
37<br/>
&gt; with no charm upgrade and there is no mez upgrade, how often will this see<br/>
&gt; play?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 60:<br/>
&gt; ????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are we to assume that this is being left blank to allow for expansion? Ok,<br/>
&gt; so that was probably a bit premature. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the<br/>
&gt; doubt till the expansion is released.<br/>
