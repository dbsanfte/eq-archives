I had to mention this to you since the discussion has turned to barbarian <br/>
warriors. My guild has a high proportion of them so I spend alot of time <br/>
&#39;heavy hauling&#39; them around, (Selo&#39;s has spoiled them all). I am a wood elf <br/>
bard and my AGI is 103 with items currently so I am faster than all the barb <br/>
warriors I know, even when they remove their BBC&#39;s. They don&#39;t see very well <br/>
and often don&#39;t know how to get where we are going so getting them to lead <br/>
is hard. They often get out of song range pretty fast. For my latest trick, <br/>
I have discovered that I can run backwards and we stay together! This always <br/>
earns me a &#39;pesky elfy&#39; comment as well! It gets laugh almost every time! <br/>
This is useful in high lag where follow isn&#39;t doing well and in &#39;safe&#39; areas <br/>
where you wont run into things that will immediately eat you. :)<br/>
