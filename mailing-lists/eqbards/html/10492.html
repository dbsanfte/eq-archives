&gt; &gt; is likely to be all that useful. The best place I found on my server to<br/>

&gt; &gt; with into the late 40&#39;s was Unrest. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yikes!  I tried Unrest at 18 and 19 and got into some of the worst groups I<br/>
&gt; have ever seen.  The groups were far more horrifying than the mobs.  Get<br/>

mean everyone groups for cutthroats, bandits, orcs, and crocs,<br/>
but you can play sloppy there and get away with it.  Around<br/>
L18-20 in Unrest, Najena, and Befallen, everyone has to work<br/>
together most of the time or you will die.  It takes some<br/>
people longer to learn this than others, so of course your<br/>
grouping experience then and there will be worse.  But once<br/>
you (and others) get past that stage, it is (was) a fantastic<br/>
place.  I got around 3-4 bubbles of experience there a night<br/>
from L19 to L25.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that might make a difference is that you can&#39;t<br/>
break out of root so easily anymore.<br/>
