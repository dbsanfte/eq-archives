Email from the Arch-Mage<br/>

Just to see if I could get a repsonse I sent a message to the Arch-Mage of <br/>
Norrath. If I had really thought I would get a repsonse I probably would <br/>
have given the questions more thought. Below, follows my questions and <br/>
repsonses.<br/>
<br/>
1. Is Lullaby bugged or has it had its effectiveness reduced? I cant seem to <br/>
keep low, low greens asleep. I get the head nods message and they continue <br/>
to attack. From my experience and the posts of other Bards seems like this<br/>
song has become almost useless. Is this just something we will have to live <br/>
with?<br/>
<br/>
REPSONSE - Nothing has changed - though it does lose some of its <br/>
effectiveness against higher level creatures.<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
My Comment: I wonder if GZ even read the question? He was not asking about <br/>
higher level creatures, but about greens nodding and attacking.<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
2. Disenchanting Melody was implemented with the last patch. However, it <br/>
removes all buffs (positive and negative) from the top down. This makes this <br/>
song very unpopular as it effects the entire group. Was this an intentional <br/>
design? If so would it be possible to make it a targeted song so as not to <br/>
remove every buff on the whole team to assist one individual?<br/>
<br/>
REPSONSE - This is the design of the song. It is made for when you really <br/>
need bad magic stuff removed, and are not really picky about how it goes <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
My comment: It is a shame to wait so long for this song to be fixed to have <br/>
it be so completely useless. Another song to be moved to the page in my song <br/>
book for completely useless songs.<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Well guys there you have it, according to GZ nothing has changed with <br/>
Lullaby, (Recon he even has a clue as to how bad this song gets resisted.)<br/>
and Disenchanting Melody appears to be just the way they want it. (For the <br/>
life of me, I wish I could see why the could not have made this a targeted <br/>
song)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share this info with you.<br/>
