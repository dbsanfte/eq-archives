<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Other than that I can&#39;t see what they have in mind.  There is <br/>
&gt; little need<br/>
&gt; for an upgrade to most of our existing songs, upgrade to hymn highly<br/>
&gt; unlikely to ever occur.  I still greatly doubt that a high <br/>
&gt; level binding<br/>
&gt; song would be unbalancing.  Given the lack of knowledge other <br/>
&gt; classes have<br/>
&gt; about bards, if it was self only most people would never even know it<br/>
&gt; existed.<br/>

they were uncertain whether they would extend the cap to 60 - and give new<br/>
skills, abilities, with each level -or- extend it to level 75 and break-up<br/>
the enhancments (I personally think they should go to level 75).  He also<br/>
hinted at the idea of classes being able to borrow certain skills and<br/>
abilities from other classes (like being able to bind, etc).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s going to be weird when the expansion comes... it will be interesting to<br/>
see how they handle it.  Obviously, a lot of combat related stats are going<br/>
to have to be tweeked.  With the current caps, there is no way that a group<br/>
could tackle a level 75 MOB (our dodge skill is going to be sooooo pathetic<br/>
in awhile - unless it gets raised).<br/>
