&gt; Ah well.  Weight is a big issue for my character.  I travel with 4<br/>
&gt; backpacks, a spit, and a large sewing kit (just recently learned that<br/>
&gt; sewing kits only weigh 1 lb  vs  backpack&#39;s 3 ... I might be selling<br/>
&gt; my backpacks for large sewing kits soon).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just to reiterate:  If weight is an issue for you, backpacks<br/>
weigh 3 pounds, large bags weigh just 1 pound (0.8 actually I<br/>
think).  It may be well worth it to give up some extra slots<br/>
for the additional weight capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Purses weigh just 0.1 and are fine for holding food, bandages,<br/>
instruments, etc.<br/>
