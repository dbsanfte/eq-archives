Well Xegony has some enterprising marketers, that&#39;s for sure. I was asked <br/>
twice to trade for a Selo&#39;s drum when I had just gotten into the L40&#39;s. Both <br/>
times they wanted SMR&#39;s, FBSS&#39;s, that sort of thing. I laughed and refered <br/>
them to someone who might actually consider trading those items. I had <br/>
neither, I try to avoid Lower Guk as much as possible. I have been offered <br/>
singing boots twice, first time the guy said he would take a sharkbone <br/>
warhammer plus some plat, second guy wanted &#39;enchanter items&#39;. I didn&#39;t make <br/>
either trade, my personal opinion was the drop rate of these items wasn&#39;t <br/>
well enough established to determine actual value. I am in wait and see on <br/>
prices (considering I have less than 2k in the bank), may even brave the New <br/>
Blackburrow to get them myself. I don&#39;t know how common the drop is or how <br/>
tought the mobs that drop it are, so that makes it hard to determine the <br/>
value.<br/>
<br/>
I used to spend time hunting someone that needed any usable equipment I <br/>
found but these days I just don&#39;t have time it seems. Our guild did try to <br/>
provide equipment once, by way of collecting donations from members and <br/>
making them available on request but it turned into a bone of contention. We <br/>
also got swampped with new members who just wanted stuff. Now it&#39;s a private <br/>
thing, although we do try to help each other out when possible.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there is a very strange area in Skyfire. Our monk was out pulling and <br/>
went high on the wall on the lefthand side. he went over the top of what he <br/>
thought was the wall and fell to his death. I lev&#39;ed and went hunting and <br/>
found a sizable valley, that seemed empty and had no apparent exit. I <br/>
recovered his body and was able to lev/selos up one of the walls that had <br/>
just enough slant to let me get out. This is located on the &#39;wall&#39; near the <br/>
globe and dragon statue. Also further up along that same wall is a box that <br/>
rotates and makes a moving sound when you click on it.<br/>
