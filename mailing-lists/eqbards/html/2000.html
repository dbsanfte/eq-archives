&gt; &gt;Your group only rakes in 20pp in 2 hrs?  Or is that 20pp each in those 2<br/>
&gt; &gt;hrs?  If so then aren&#39;t you spending 20pp each to go get it at 60+ pp?  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;not, what are you hunting?  I can make 20pp in 4 hours by myself hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt;orcs, with 2 could easily do it in 2hrs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; er, I believe it would be appropriate to include a<br/>
&gt; discussion of level here. It of course looks like wanton<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About 5-10pp/hr is about what I&#39;ve been pulling in for myself<br/>
while grouped at L19-20.  This is based on my bank account<br/>
balance at the end of each playsession, and so includes things<br/>
like goofing off, traveling, recovering from deaths, selling<br/>
high-ticket items like a shiny brass halberd, etc.  Some days<br/>
are better, some days are worse.  If you only consider hunting<br/>
time, then of course it will be higher.<br/>
<br/>
Since the scenario I was hypothesizing involved traveling<br/>
across the ocean to Crushbone and returning, I thought I<br/>
should use the pp/hr rate I get on average, not when I&#39;m<br/>
hunting.  If you want to compare over hunting time, then it<br/>
only takes about 5-20 minutes of hunting Dvinn to get a dirk<br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
The crazy thing was I actually went up to about 10-15pp/hr<br/>
while I was in Crushbone.  Everyone was so busy camping Crush,<br/>
Dvinn, Darish, and the Trainer, they didn&#39;t seem to care if I<br/>
took the royal guard.  Those 4pp rapiers add up quick.<br/>
