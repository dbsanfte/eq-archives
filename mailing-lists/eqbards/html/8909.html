&gt;I&#39;m not on Tunare - but I&#39;m curious why you&#39;d want to be in a Bard-only<br/>
&gt;guild. In my opinion - the biggest advantage of a guild is to more easily<br/>
&gt;find people at similar level; to group with.  I have had some success in<br/>
&gt;larger groups with another bard; but the couple of times I&#39;d been in a group<br/>
&gt;with two other bards - I felt I&#39;d have been better off with a more diverse<br/>
&gt;group.  I&#39;m a big proponent of &quot;combined arms&quot; tactics...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been in a couple of guilds - and I actually like the fact that in my<br/>
&gt;current guild - I&#39;m the only bard (makes my services to be in very high<br/>
&gt;demand!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in a Bards-only guild on Bristlebane - &quot;The Wandering Minstrels&quot;, and I<br/>
must admit, there is always a time when I regret that there are no casters<br/>
to bind us or rangers to help track or other innummerable needed things,<br/>
but I tell you, when we have a guild get-together, it&#39;s a regular chorus<br/>
line ;)<br/>
