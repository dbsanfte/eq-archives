<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082156292">Ok, so last night we got to Kith to kill a couple Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Our pally who has just gotten the dmg 2 delay 6 poker from PoS seems to have<br/>
gotten the full attention of the Generalisimo.  I am on my cleric and<br/>
/assisting the mob while watching my group&#39;s bars.  The pally - not in my<br/>
group - starts to drop at a fast rate. I figger he&#39;s got his own cleric but<br/>
a remedy wont hurt. As fast as I can drop a rememdy on him he&#39;s dropping off<br/>
again. So I chain cast another.  Then say screw that and chain cast a divine<br/>
lite. Then 3 more divine lites. <br/>
<br/>
He lives!!!  After the fight, in /gu I find out that 2 other clerics were<br/>
doing the same thing: chain casting divine light/remedys - heh. So, yeah,<br/>
different spells for different situations.<br/>

<br/>
complete heal is the most powerful spell in the game.  but obviously a<br/>
cleric needs to know how to use it along with their other heals effectively.<br/>
