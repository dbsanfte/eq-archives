<div id="ygrps-yiv-188744796">I have a big problem and I am hoping that somebody can help me.<br/>
<br/>
My brother is away on vacation and i play his character (a bard) and died and<br/>
lose a level. I play other characters (ranger,druid,warrior) into the 20s, but I<br/>
never play anything like this one now. He is in the low 40s and even if i fight<br/>
things that are green (tried a cyclops) i have to run so far. I really need<br/>
somebody to please tell me how to fight with a bard like this and what to fight<br/>
so i can get him back his level before he comes home and kicks my butt!<br/>
<br/>
The guy has all the songs i think and i just dont know how to fight right. When<br/>
I just fight with 2 swords i get killed even with the beserk song playing.<br/>
<br/>
Please help!</div>
