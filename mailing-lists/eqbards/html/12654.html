<div id="ygrps-yiv-366455064">It kinda depends - my views of what a bard is &#39;group support&#39; - if I can do<br/>
it better by staying out of the melee - ie drums for battle buffs/resists,<br/>
mana song, crowd control, what ever - that&#39;s what I wanna do.  What it<br/>
depends on is the level of mob and the rest of your group.  <br/>
<br/>
I can be the baby in the group and we are fight red-to-me&#39;s - I wanna stay<br/>
out of the way of harm and still contribute - if there are real strong tanks<br/>
- out come the drums.  I can be the highest level in the group and fighting<br/>
mainly greens with an occasional blue or 2 - just being there to help my<br/>
guild members grow. Then I can be fairly effective in the melee and want the<br/>
good weps.<br/>

		Of all the people how<br/>
		often does a bard really melee at that level? A war?<br/>
Personally I just think<br/>
		them lee classes should get the first yak and then a bard<br/>
who  I still can&#39;t<br/>
		decide what to call it besides bard. They don&#39;t seem like a<br/>
melee class to<br/>
		me at high leels butrather a support utility.<br/>
