<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007446140">Okay, here&#39;s a question.  For the lambent vambraces one of the things you<br/>
need is fiery vambraces from a solusek champion.  I know there is a kobold<br/>
champion in Solusek B, but this seems like a pretty hard kill to aquire this<br/>
item (in comparison to the other pieces).  Not having spent much time in<br/>
Solusek A, I was wondering if there&#39;s a goblin champion there that this<br/>
might be referring to instead?  Anyone know much about Sol A that has an<br/>
answer?<br/>
