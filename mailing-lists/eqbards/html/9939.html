<div id="ygrps-yiv-826518362">I would think that, but the wood elf females I have seen with them are also<br/>
light blue tinged, maybe someone thought it would be funny to have male<br/>
woodsies wear pink and females wear blue.<br/>

it may be a video card thing, but i&#39;m not sure.  i know a wood elf male<br/>
friend in mithril legs definitely has a pinkish hue, while when i wear them<br/>
(wood elf female) they look normally as light blue.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing <br/>
&gt; wood-elf males out<br/>
&gt; there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am <br/>
&gt; wearing the shin<br/>
&gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I <br/>
&gt; have never seen<br/>
&gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be <br/>
&gt; a rose tinged<br/>
&gt; silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly <br/>
&gt; get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
&gt; examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The <br/>
&gt; wood elf females<br/>
&gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged. <br/>
&gt;  Is this the<br/>
&gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose <br/>
&gt; color is normal<br/>
&gt; then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
