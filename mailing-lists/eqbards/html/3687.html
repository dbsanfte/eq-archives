&gt;      YES!,  It is very annoying.  I like to help out people within the <br/>
&gt;      confines of the game (locate body ect.) but Begging for money is a <br/>
&gt;      different case altogether.  I always ignore begging but it makes me <br/>
&gt;      feel guilty anyway. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A level 2 paladin at the bank was begging from my group last<br/>
night.  I looked at his equipment.  I told him to sell his<br/>
fine steel 2H sword and use the money to fill in his empty<br/>
armor slots.<br/>

If you don&#39;t beg, I just might give you stuff if you look like<br/>
you&#39;re in a jam (spent two hours helping people recover their<br/>
bodies in Befallen a couple nights ago).  If you beg, I won&#39;t<br/>
give you stuff because that will just encourage more begging.<br/>
