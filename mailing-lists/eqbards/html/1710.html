<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bards N Plate and people&#39;s opinions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-392554508">What I dont understand is where people are getting their idea<br/>
of roleplaying.  I am assuming they are getting the definition<br/>
from AD&D, where Bards were traveling musicians but kept<br/>
away from direct combat and never wore heavy armor.  <br/>
<br/>
Norrath is a world created by taking small ideas from all the <br/>
other RPG&#39;s that are out there.  The designer&#39;s version of a <br/>
bard is different than bards that we know.  The designer&#39;s version<br/>
of a gnoll is different than any I have encountered (gnolls in AD&D<br/>
are 7&#39; tall, the gnolls in Norrath are short - unless you count that<br/>
Giant Gnoll) :).  <br/>
<br/>
In a RPG situation, I see no valid restrictions on Bards not wearing<br/>
armor  plate for the fact they can&#39;t move enough to play their songs.<br/>
If that were the case, warriors would not be able to use a bow while<br/>
in plate, no one would be able to run, etc. There is no single reason<br/>
why Bards should not be able to wear plate.  The argument &quot;It is not<br/>
part of a roleplaying environment&quot;  is wrong.  The way Norrath has<br/>
been designed it *IS* in the roleplaying environment.  <br/>

&gt; From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot; of<br/>
&gt; the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>
&gt; travel,<br/>
&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>
&gt; which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt; sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i<br/>
&gt; appreciated<br/>
&gt; that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>
&gt; you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>
&gt; argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>
&gt; bards.  This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>
&gt; commited to convictions.  -=) <br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>
&gt; &gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.  Infact I have on more<br/>
&gt; &gt; then one occasion parited with groups above my exp gain level for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sole purpose of helping them and recording their first visit to a new<br/>
&gt; land.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unlike many I&#39;m willing to bet I also sing sea chanties on boatrides,<br/>
&gt; &gt; make little poems for each of my songs (lyrics) etc.  I also game,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have fought wisps till blue in the face (anyone else pissed at the<br/>
&gt; nosave<br/>
&gt; &gt; now turned burned out lightstone bull?) and have kited,soloed, grouped<br/>
&gt; &gt; and twisted with the best of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m tired of seeing this roleplay plate mail talk and quite a few<br/>
&gt; others,<br/>
&gt; &gt; let me give you abit of backround.  The EQ bard seems to me best<br/>
&gt; compared<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the CELTIC bard.  It&#39;s important to understand the Celtic bard as<br/>
&gt; opposed<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; what we have come to call a bard.  The religion of the celts being<br/>
&gt; Druidic<br/>
&gt; &gt; was split in several sections with three primary universal among the<br/>
&gt; tribes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The preist/mage type the ones we typically see in flowing robes and call<br/>
&gt; druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; that most RPG&#39;s consider.  The judge section Gaelic Brehon (sp) who<br/>
&gt; administered<br/>
&gt; &gt; clan law and succession issues. And the Bard who recorded the histories,<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; &gt; the tales, taught the faith, ran the messages, recorded the liniages<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The celtic bard was by no means some weak pansy musician, nor a figure<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; lightly.  The bard seldome directly fought in wars but was certainly<br/>
&gt; often<br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; &gt; trained in arms and would often run into situations in his travels where<br/>
&gt; fightin<br/>
&gt; &gt; was needed.  In the period Plate was not an option and so from a<br/>
&gt; historical point, the bard would not have worn plate, however the Celts<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; invent chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that being the strongest of the time would have worn that if they<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; access it (bards of the stonger clans) so there is no reason to say they<br/>
&gt; would reject plate.<br/>
