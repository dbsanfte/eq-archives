<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576632460">all i am saying is that when we went into the avatar room in cazic, or now<br/>
go into the king hall of solusek B or the tower in lower guk, etc. there are<br/>
two things imperative we look for: at least one healer and someone who can<br/>
group gate.  otherwise it is not only hard but nearly impossible to<br/>
adventure deep into dungeons.<br/>

&gt; &gt; as far as the decision to play heal or mana song, i find <br/>
&gt; the same thing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that everyone wants the mana song instead of heal, because <br/>
&gt; your healer&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; meditate combined with the mana song allows them to heal <br/>
&gt; the group faster<br/>
&gt; &gt; than your healing song.  if you are in a group with no <br/>
&gt; healers, you got<br/>
&gt; &gt; bigger problems hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fighting without a healer is not that much more difficult.<br/>
&gt; Everyone has to know what they are doing and be ready to stop<br/>
&gt; attacking if they&#39;re getting beat up more than the others.  A<br/>
&gt; paladin, rogue, and I did pretty well in Cazic like this,<br/>
&gt; picking off one or two (sometimes three) of the lesser mobs.  <br/>
&gt; I had my songs that could taunt, the rogue had backstab, and<br/>
&gt; the paladin was doing some nice damage with his SBH and double<br/>
&gt; attack.  We certainly had to stay more alert during combat,<br/>
&gt; monitoring each others&#39; health and backing out or taunting as<br/>
&gt; needed, but were able to do pretty well there (didn&#39;t die, got<br/>
&gt; lots of loot and experience).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having a healer basically lets you be a little more sloppy<br/>
&gt; with distributing damage, and take a little (or a lot) more<br/>
&gt; risk in wandering away from the zone or fighting things you<br/>
&gt; might not be able to beat.<br/>
