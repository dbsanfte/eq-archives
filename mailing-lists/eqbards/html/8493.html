<div id="ygrps-yiv-87565505">You are going to have trouble saying &quot;this is what jig DOESN&#39;T do&quot; rather<br/>
than giving an alternate benefit. Here&#39;s what I would say...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jig makes your mana counter MORE ACCURATE and also increases stamina regen&quot;<br/>
rather than<br/>
&quot;Jig DOESN&#39;T increase mana, only stamina&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That way you arn&#39;t directly telling the person that they are wrong ;-) ...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I could be wrong... Need a tester!<br/>
