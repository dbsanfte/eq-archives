<div id="ygrps-yiv-635981544">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am a Bard and a Rogue.  This is the reason why I send this message out to<br/>
2 list.<br/>
Last night when we were having network problem, I was still on as my bard in<br/>
Nfreeport.  I was running then suddenly a GM start asking me these survey<br/>
question about the bard.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if it is a she or a he:<br/>
Do you still like your bard?  ( I am at lvl 19 right now)<br/>
My answer:  I loved the bard and still does.<br/>
<br/>
What so special about the bard that you like?<br/>
My answer:  It is so diversify even though we are not good at any one thing<br/>
but we can mostly do it <br/>
all at a very low skill.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of the bard compare to SK, Warriors, Rogue, and Wizards?<br/>
My answer:  I do not know about the other class but I have played as a<br/>
rogue.  I played as a rogue originally but after reaching lvl 17 I find it<br/>
not as fun anymore.  The skill are broken.  Nothing to look forward to<br/>
beyond lvl 17 so I created this bard.  I was not expecting much.  I was<br/>
testing out this class but now I loved it.  it takes a lot of patience to<br/>
play a bard well because every song is different and each apply differently<br/>
in different situation.  I still used my lvl 1 and 7 songs.<br/>
<br/>
Would you want to play any of those classes?<br/>
My answer:  I said not really.  I am having too much fun with my bard.<br/>
<br/>
How does a bard fit into a group?<br/>
My answer:  People do not understand what a bard does for group.  We can<br/>
heal, buff, debuff, speed, and attack also.  But people would rather have<br/>
the 3 most important class first before considering the bard: Warriors like<br/>
( Warriors, Monk, Paladin, SK, Rangers), Clerics, Magic class (Magicians,<br/>
wizards, Necromancer)<br/>
<br/>
What is the bard favorite weapon?<br/>
My answer:  We do not have a specific weapon.  We used what ever is<br/>
available to us.  But I would not mind having a special instrument<br/>
implemented.<br/>
<br/>
What extra would you like to see in the bard (Teleportation, some other<br/>
stuff I cannot remember)?<br/>
My answer:  I would not mind having bind.  It would makes our travel a lot<br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
Then the person says thanx and that was it.<br/>
I think this person seek me out because there was a lot of complaint about<br/>
bard after reaching lvl 20.  Also that I do /guildsay after I do something<br/>
amazing like kill 2 orc priest at one time with losing only 1/2 of my health<br/>
&quot;It is good to be a wood elf bard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think they (Verant) do care about our opinion.  <br/>
To the rogues: Maybe it is taking them a long time to implement what they<br/>
promise.  Lets keep our finger cross.<br/>
<br/>
All of these answers are my opinion of the class and experience.  I know I<br/>
have very little of it because I am only lvl 19.  Only if those mages would<br/>
stop stealing my kills then maybe I might be able to lvl a little faster.<br/>
