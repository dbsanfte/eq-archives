&gt; I didn&#39;t really do any testing last night, but after one or two uses last<br/>
&gt; night, I came to the conclusion that our snare song has been secretly<br/>
&gt; nerfed.  Before, using this song on a monster at half life or less would<br/>
&gt; effectively freeze it in its tracks.  Last night, casting it on mostly<br/>
&gt; dead<br/>
&gt; mobs still allowed the mobs to move as a regular snare would.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else noticed this, or is it just me?<br/>

tracks.  I have noticed that if they&#39;re running away with more than about<br/>
1/4 health(greenies do this), it only slows them, not stops them.  But if<br/>
they&#39;re running with less than about 1/4 health, it seems to stop them.<br/>
