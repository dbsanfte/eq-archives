<div id="ygrps-yiv-815579338"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s my question to all of you more experienced bards: What level can I<br/>
&gt;&gt; expect to have a reasonable shot at soloing the maid butler area? I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;&gt; quite content to just do the maid and butler room, and leave the hall and<br/>
&gt;&gt; kitchen alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t tried soloing there.  Maybe I should.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what level you can solo it, since I didn&#39;t try it solo until<br/>
50.  Basically, I just invis into the butler room and do a CoC, Hymns, CoD,<br/>
Niv&#39;s twist, switching to CoC, Chains, CoD, Chains when the mob is about<br/>
ready to run.  If the gargoyle is a flouting, I&#39;ll throw in a Charm every<br/>
few rounds, but that&#39;s mostly just to mitigate damage intake.  If it&#39;s a<br/>
jeering, I just AE both spots at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Next, pull the mob that&#39;s right outside into the butler room and finish it<br/>
off with the AE twist.<br/>
<br/>
Next, standing at the butler end of the maid/butler hallway, pull the<br/>
closest hall mob to the butler room, and AE it.<br/>
<br/>
Pull the second maid/butler hall spawn to butler, AE it.<br/>
<br/>
Now you&#39;re left with just the two maid room spawns.  You can either (1)<br/>
stand in the hallway green-pull the gargoyle (about 40% of the time the<br/>
maid/ph comes anyway), (2) lament the gargoyle and pull the maid/ph, or (3)<br/>
just take them both at the same time in the maid room, like you did the<br/>
butler room.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I generally don&#39;t have any problems with this technique, although a caster<br/>
will rarely take me down to a bubble.  I&#39;ve only had to zone once (make sure<br/>
you chain/pixie the mob, then fire up invis as you head out, so you don&#39;t<br/>
train the castle).<br/>
<br/>
The Butler and Maid are rather easy, compared to their placeholders.  The<br/>
Butler may lead with Harm Touch, but after that my health stays steady.<br/>
Both die quickly.<br/>
<br/>
If the cooks are still up, pull the mobs you&#39;re fighting as far away from<br/>
the kitchen side of the room as possible, so the cooks don&#39;t keep healing<br/>
them (although, the healing is rather minute).<br/>
<br/>
I tend to leave the cooks alone unless I have a partner.  At 50, one is<br/>
usually green and the other is usually blue.  I can pull them individually,<br/>
but the Harm Touch combined with their melee can really hurt.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m writing this, I just realized I haven&#39;t taken advantage of Chain/Fear<br/>
in close fights at all in these rooms.  Dumb bard.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re 47+ (maybe lower; that&#39;s when I first duo&#39;ed the rooms), you&#39;re<br/>
better off soloing than you are having a partner below 47.  The reason is,<br/>
if you do get a runner (note: don&#39;t have runners) at 47+, you simply heal up<br/>
while you wait for the mob to return; you can also chase it down past the<br/>
kitchen.  If you have a partner who is below the &quot;green pull&quot; threshold, and<br/>
you have a runner, the castle is coming for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a partner, realize that buff songs/spells (ie, healing) will<br/>
work if one of you is sitting in each room.  A healing teammate is nice<br/>
because you can pull out your Chants line to make the kills faster.<br/>
