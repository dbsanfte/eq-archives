successful. We would fight and then stop and heal together. Every time it<br/>
would stack properly. The next day however we couldnt do it at all. I<br/>
highly doubt that we just got lucky over 20 times over the course of 3<br/>
hours. But then again yours is the best explanation ive heard. :p</div>
