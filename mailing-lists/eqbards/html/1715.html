&gt;Subject: Bards N Plate and people&#39;s opinions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot; of<br/>
&gt;the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>
 </span></blockquote>travel,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>
&gt;which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in a<br/>
&gt;roleplay situation, however, not plate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone who can&#39;t roleplay a character because their character is wearing<br/>
Plate instead of Leather is a poor roleplayer.  Back when I was in high<br/>
school and being the DM, I&#39;d &quot;roleplay&quot; 20+ characters a session.  Never<br/>
once was I unable to roleplay a character because the armor he was wearing<br/>
didn&#39;t fit my personal views of what a character from history supposedly<br/>
wore.<br/>
<br/>
This is Norrath we are talking about, not Earth.  Bards are not Celtic bards<br/>
or European minstrels.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is my opinion, and I feel both<br/>
&gt;sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i appreciated<br/>
&gt;that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>
&gt;you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>
&gt;argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>
&gt;bards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So give me any valid argument of how a bard song makes a group invisible or<br/>
how playing a drum makes you run twice as fast.  In fact, how is magic and<br/>
monsters &quot;valid&quot; to begin with?  But lets try anyway...<br/>

I am Luti, a 4th generation Bard.  My friend Windraven, a Paladin, and I,<br/>
daily go out to rid Qeynos Hills of the evil gnolls.  I am wearing Leather<br/>
armor because that is what my father and his father before him always wore.<br/>
Windraven has a suit of Plate handed down from his grandfather.  When we go<br/>
out to hunt the gnolls, Windraven has to protect me.  His platemail easily<br/>
turns back the rusty weapons of the Blackburrow gnolls.  But the same swords<br/>
bite deeply into my Leather tunic.  I wish I was able to wear the Plate.<br/>
<br/>
So one day Windraven and I are down at Crows playing some cards.  It was a<br/>
hot day and Windraven decided to take off his armor.  After another flash of<br/>
mead, Windraven had to &quot;excuse&quot; himself yet again. Looking at his Plate, I<br/>
decide to see what it feels like to wear it.  So I remove my Leather boots<br/>
and put on his Steel Plate Boots.  Wow, these would protect my feet much<br/>
better when Fippy steps on them.  And they don&#39;t affect my singing or<br/>
instrument playing at all.  Then I put on the Platemail Helm.  It is heavy,<br/>
but the faceplate is open, allowing easy access for my flute and brass horn.<br/>
I try on the rest of the pieces and they feel great.  The Breastplate flexes<br/>
enough for me to get deep breaths needed for my songs.  The Plate Girdle<br/>
actually has a hook for me to hang my drum on.  The leg, back and neck<br/>
pieces don&#39;t interfere with any of my abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Only with the Plate Gauntlets do I see any difficulties.  I can&#39;t see how<br/>
I&#39;d play my instruments with these guantlets on.  I thought the same about<br/>
my Leather gloves when I tried playing my Lute.  But with much practice, I<br/>
was able to manage.  Maybe I could manage to practice and learn to play with<br/>
these Gauntlets too.<br/>
<br/>
I hear a great laughter behind me.  Windraven is rolling on the floor.  He<br/>
says &quot;Silly Bard, you can&#39;t wear Plate&quot;.  &quot;Why not?&quot; I ask.............<br/>
