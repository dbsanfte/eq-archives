&gt;   Too many resists cause problems when fighting monster L40+, that is what<br/>
&gt;   I was referring to.  I&#39;d rather chain something, or try to chain<br/>
&gt;   something, then call for a snare before the monster runs.  Either<br/>
&gt;   way, chains are not as useful as they once were.  Chains interferes<br/>
&gt;   with shaman drowsy and enchanter slowdowns, for sure.  I let the<br/>
&gt;   casters slow and the ranger snare, since I have much more important<br/>
&gt;   things to twist.  (If someone does go on the run, yes running and<br/>
&gt;   casting is an awesome thing that people overlook frequently)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was not referring to weaving it in combat but as an emergency, &#39;hey that <br/>
frog is running&#39; type of thing :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Still using charm at 39th, great for saving that party member that is at<br/>
&gt; &gt; half a bubble, or pulling the Dar off the cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Again, Lguk / SolB - that all ends.  Not much to charm anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh, been in Lguk/SolB for the last couple of months, still is useful, I <br/>
saved 3 party members from certain death over the weekend doing this :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; who cares about holding them? When I can interrupt the casting of <br/>
&gt;froglok<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard 90% of the time with a well placed pixie strike I am a happy <br/>
&gt;camper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Your 3 sec cast + 1 sec to even hit the button once you see the caster<br/>
&gt;   visual, is typically not enough time to sink an interrupt unless you<br/>
&gt;   devote yourself to pixie&#39;ing the mob forever, I&#39;d rather twist magic<br/>
&gt;   and something else.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is normally what I do with casters, as they keep trying to cast and <br/>
never fight back :) Makes those undead wizards a cake walk.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heh I never play mana song alone unless I am being lazy, you can weave <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt; with on other song without losing effect.  You can even do it with 2 <br/>
&gt;songs +<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana and still get 80% of the effect of playing mana song alone.  Do not<br/>
&gt; &gt; listen to greedy casters that say play mana only unless you want to 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Since mana song is instant effect, and not pulse based, twisting<br/>
&gt;   it just hurts the effectiveness.  That said, I still do twist it<br/>
&gt;   in, but only after berserk and psalm are up.  Unless I have like<br/>
&gt;   a party of five wizards, hehehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it is an instant effect, but... The &#39;pulse&#39; time on clarity sung <br/>
straight is 6 seconds, our songs have a 3 second casting time. A one song <br/>
weave will pulse clarity every 7 secs or so (depending on how tight you <br/>
weave).  To weave 2 songs plus clarity I do this: Song1 - Clarity - Song2 - <br/>
Clarity - Song1 - Clarity, etc...  Clarity gets pulsed about every 7 <br/>
seconds, the other songs stay up (unless lag is bad).  Now if the situation <br/>
is tight (big battle cleric is medding for heals), I will play clarity <br/>
straight, as missed notes can really hurt in that kind of situation.<br/>
