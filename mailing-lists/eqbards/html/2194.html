<div id="ygrps-yiv-337864406">My friend and I got caught in our first boat crash ever. We were happily<br/>
journeying on the boat, and we hit the zone to Freeport. All of a sudden, EQ<br/>
disappeared, and in it&#39;s place a BIG GPF! EQ had crashed...ACK! The friend I<br/>
was with confirmed that it had happened to him as well (we were talking on<br/>
the phone at the time). I finally get back in the game, and when I log in, I<br/>
am standing on the boat...in East Freeport. Whew... So , as I get ready to<br/>
jump ship....BAM, we zoned into Ocean of Tears....NOOOOOOOO!!!!! *Sigh* I<br/>
petitioned a GM, and he was very kind though, and teleported my friend and I<br/>
to Freeport...but not until I had traveled all the way back to Kaladim<br/>
again....<br/>

Hehe, bet many of you have never seen that message. The only bummer was<br/>
about 20 minutes wasted, and the free binds we had lined up from a friend<br/>
were gone, since he was halfway to Oasis by the time we got ourselves back<br/>
to Freeport. I&#39;m still not bound there either, since I couldn&#39;t get anyone<br/>
to bind last night. So I just camped. I&#39;ll try again today I suppose...<br/>

&gt; Its a serious problem, I got dropped into the ocean of tears... spent 1.5<br/>
&gt; hours swimming, thank god for the jig, finally made it to the Isle of the<br/>
&gt; Sisters ( i was dropped just entering OOT from Kaladim), Then for a kick<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the pants I caught the boat at the isle, and entered the freeport zone,<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; disconned, and appeared as boat was leaving Freeport, had to jumpship and<br/>
&gt; swim to the docks.  My swimming is 91 now.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; was sitting lost all Stam down to 1 bubble and ppl on the boat kept<br/>
&gt; &gt;disappearing &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Greetings,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I took my first boat ride the other night and also noticed stamina<br/>
&gt; dropping.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmmm, also sounded like perhaps I was swimming?  Ok, so I got up and<br/>
walked<br/>
&gt; &gt;around till that strange sound stopped.  Stamina started picking up.  Sat<br/>
&gt; &gt;down.  Stamina started dropping again.  Finally realized that it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;matter where I sat, sitting just plain drained my Stam.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;People disappearing, yes.  Very strange.  Could just be graphics glitch?<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was in a party with a friend and we were in group speak so can&#39;t comment<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt;/say.  But it was a little disturbing to see your partner sitting there<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt;second and then vanishing right before your eyes.  But because of opinion<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt;this and other lists, I refrained from singing on the boat at all.  Far<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;for me, little lowly 6.5 songstress, to be the cause of a boat crash!<br/>
LOL<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher level brothers<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;sisters.  But where are the young ones such as myself?  The tales and<br/>
&gt; &gt;adventures I read here are things I won&#39;t be seeing for some time to<br/>
come.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Are there any others in the 5th to 10th season with advice and knowledge<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;share as well?  Let&#39;s speak up and help each other with similar<br/>
questions.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have questions as well which I will post later (time for work!).<br/>
