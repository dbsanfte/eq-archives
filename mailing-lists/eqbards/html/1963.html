<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269950782">Hello there all! I have a few questions that arose during my adventure<br/>
today....<br/>
<br/>
1) I have a Lute called &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; or something like that.<br/>
Does anyone know if it has any significance? Is it just a quest item? I<br/>
tried using it, and it works in all respects (that I could tell) like a<br/>
normal Lute. Nothing special. I did notice that I could sell it for almost 4<br/>
plat, where a normal lute doesn&#39;t make it to 1 plat. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>
tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named Nostrolo in the<br/>
&quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>
person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this fella? Could<br/>
someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is Lisera a lute<br/>
you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>
<br/>
3) Does anyone know of a site that has descriptions of what songs do above<br/>
24th level??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help!!<br/>
