<b>Subject:</b> [eqbard] A Bard&#39;s usefulness after lvl 12 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255738664">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has been experiencing the same things that I<br/>
have been as of late.  To start off I remember when I finally reached<br/>
level 6 and got hymm of restoration, I was  a hot commodity in just about<br/>
any group.  However now that I am at lvl 16 no one seem to want a bard in<br/>
their party.  Perhaps it is because of my hunting in unrest, but I would<br/>
think a bard would be a useful addition to any party there.  However, it<br/>
seems a bard&#39;s utility is my undoing.  People either want a tank, or a<br/>
healer or a burner and I can never be any of them.  Many parties seem to<br/>
forget the advantages of some of the bard songs.  With anthem, my friend a<br/>
lvl 14 Druid and I were able to mow down Tormented after tormented with<br/>
next to no downtime.  In fact my friend rarely cast a spell because the<br/>
two of us could melee the TDs without too much trouble.  I was armed with<br/>
a Combine Long Sword and he a runed Totem Staff.  Now I can imagine how<br/>
effective Warriors would be with Dual wield and dual attacks and all tanks<br/>
in general.  Does partying get worse from here on out?  I have started a<br/>
mage and had more luck partying at level 13, than I did with my bard which<br/>
doesn&#39;t make too much sense to me.<br/>
