&gt;Is it possible to run through Beholder with Accelerando?  I made the trip<br/>
&gt;through last weekend crawling along high on the cliff and it was nerve<br/>
&gt;wracking.  I would much rather make a fast dash through and get it over<br/>
&gt;with!  But I saw at least a dozen evil eyes from my vantage point on the<br/>
&gt;cliff wall...can I run past fast enough to avoid trouble?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You aren&#39;t lyin, friend - when I had said previously that the Beholder route <br/>
was my favorite, I was referring to my experience during beta4. Evil eyes <br/>
and muddites weren&#39;t as prevalent as then and it was a quick, easy trip (did <br/>
they even have muddites in beta? I never encountered one before), not to <br/>
mention the only mino you would ever see were Lessers on the way through. I <br/>
guess it&#39;s much easier after 20th?<br/>
