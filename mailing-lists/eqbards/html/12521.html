<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924762870">after that patch, but not recently, i dueled a level 50 enchanter.  i got<br/>
the message that i could not charm that NPC or whatever, but even though i<br/>
got the message, her pet started beating the crap out of her.  she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to die (though i REALLY wanted to kill her) so i feared her pet away<br/>
with 10hp left on her.  then i made her zone.<br/>

&gt; Actually the reason it did not stick is that a couple of <br/>
&gt; months ago they <br/>
&gt; patched charm so that you could not charm a pet while the <br/>
&gt; summoner is still <br/>
&gt; alive.<br/>
