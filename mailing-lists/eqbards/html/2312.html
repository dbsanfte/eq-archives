&gt; I have found the /follow command to be a lifesaver for travelling in groups<br/>
&gt; with selo&#39;s.  the only time you could not use it is in areas that are not<br/>
&gt; wide-open or dangerous, like lavastorm, where you would not use it anyway.<br/>
&gt; as far as long distance travels tho, auto-follow is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Follow definately makes life a lot easier than previously, but I&#39;m still<br/>
finding, even in open areas, that due to the weird client prediction<br/>
bugs and people&#39;s wide variation in ping times it can still screw up a<br/>
lot. I&#39;ve found it works best if I dont have people set follow to me,<br/>
but to someone who&#39;s about the slowest in the party. Then I follow that<br/>
person too, that puts me in the middle of the group instead of ahead,<br/>
making it more likely I will keep everyone under the effect of Selo&#39;s.<br/>
However this often also results in my client deciding the person I was<br/>
following turned right and ran in a circle a couple of times then<br/>
disappeared, when in fact they continued in a straight line. <br/>
<br/>
A good trick I used to use before the follow patch that can still be<br/>
useful is when you are leading with Selo&#39;s and need to slow down to let<br/>
people catch up, instead of stopping, which usually causes most of your<br/>
party to also stop to see why you stopped, crouch while running, which<br/>
will slow you down considerably. <br/>
