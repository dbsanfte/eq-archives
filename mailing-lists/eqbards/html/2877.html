<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273153154">Mob hate is very apparent in Unrest, I did was playing heal and Anthem, with<br/>
a group of early 20&#39;s (full group) the mobs totally ignored our tanks and 3<br/>
Dry bones, a carrion ghoul and the Bartender all came for me, needless to<br/>
say I died. The clerics who were not quite believers in the Bard Hate idea,<br/>
werent prepared, and werent monitoring me.<br/>
<br/>
Mob hate is also apparent in Blackburrow to some extent, my first Bard I<br/>
didnt know any different , I later took another class in and was amazed at<br/>
how much easier it was, and how little I got trained.<br/>
<br/>
But by far the worst experience Ive seen, to the point of laughability was<br/>
in Splitpaw. When I was 9-10th level I went in with a full group of 6, with<br/>
2 tanks, a cleric, a shaman, a caster and myself.<br/>
EVERY pull , every wandering Mob, Everything ignored the tanks the casters<br/>
and made a beeline to me, I was very upset, the others couldnt believe it.<br/>
It got to the point that they couldnt effectively hunt because they were too<br/>
busy trying to take mobs off of me and keep me alive.  I eventually left<br/>
because I felt like i was kinda holding them back.<br/>

&gt;I think the mobs in Unrest just hate us.  I can be inside the zone about 30<br/>
&gt;minutes before I have a random mob attack me from nowhere, whether I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;playing a song or not and no matter which songs I&#39;ve played in the zone.  I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t seen this in any other zone, and thankfully they&#39;ve always come<br/>

&gt;tackle the basement.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>
&gt;&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was<br/>

&gt;&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>
&gt;&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker -<br/>
&gt;&gt; thankfully, I am the<br/>
&gt;&gt; only one that died.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of<br/>
&gt;&gt; NOWHERE - why<br/>
&gt;&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>
&gt;&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less<br/>
&gt;&gt; long) and<br/>
&gt;&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>
