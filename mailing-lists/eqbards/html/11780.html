&gt; &gt;Let me cut to the chase:  If you were in a zone with nothing<br/>
&gt; &gt;to hunt, would you continue playing?  Would most people<br/>
&gt; &gt;continue playing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never seen NOTHING to hunt - ever. I am an extremely patient hunter, I<br/>

reluctant to admit there could be situations where the game<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth playing, I gave you the question to force a stand<br/>
one way or another.<br/>

&gt; &gt;when everything else is the same and the only differing factor<br/>
&gt; &gt;is people.  True, they are not deliberately and directly<br/>
&gt; &gt;preventing you from finding anything to hunt, but they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;doing it indirectly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then why are you laying the blame at their feet? That&#39;s like complaining<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are a contributing cause to the problem.  &quot;Blaming&quot; them<br/>
was your way of characterizing it, not mine.  It&#39;s rather<br/>
difficult to solve a problem if you aren&#39;t allowed to pinpoint<br/>
the causes for fear of being accused of blaming someone or<br/>
something.  :)<br/>

&gt; Frustrating yes - but it&#39;s not THEIR fault.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s their fault.  I&#39;m saying they are a<br/>
contributing cause, and therefor one cannot say they are<br/>
irrelevant to the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Bad things do not always have malicious intent behind them.  <br/>
Sometimes they just happen.  It&#39;s very possible for people to<br/>
make all the right decisions and still have things go wrong.  <br/>
Just because I say people are causing a problem does not mean<br/>
I think they are doing it out of maliciousness and need to be<br/>
blamed and reprimanded.<br/>
