was your way of characterizing it, not mine.  It&#39;s rather<br/>
difficult to solve a problem if you aren&#39;t allowed to pinpoint<br/>
the causes for fear of being accused of blaming someone or<br/>
something.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s their fault.  I&#39;m saying they are a<br/>
contributing cause, and therefor one cannot say they are<br/>
irrelevant to the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Bad things do not always have malicious intent behind them.  <br/>
Sometimes they just happen.  It&#39;s very possible for people to<br/>
make all the right decisions and still have things go wrong.  <br/>
Just because I say people are causing a problem does not mean<br/>
I think they are doing it out of maliciousness and need to be<br/>
blamed and reprimanded.<br/>
