<div id="ygrps-yiv-133004402"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Damn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It mustve been... as I did 3 times last nite:<br/>
<br/>
Death number 1: We ran to help a party member because she&#39;d been attacked by<br/>
what seemed like an entire pride of lions (bad simba!) while trying to run<br/>
to HH by herself and the guards in the village she was near were just<br/>
watching her die.... mind you, the dying was my own fault as I accidentally<br/>
hit two of my hotkeys, and Chords of Dissonance was the hotkey that won (go<br/>
figure) so of course a farmer attacked (green to me) and then a guard<br/>
attacked (red - ouch) and killed me.<br/>
<br/>
Running back from Freeport (I own several drums, most of which I keep in the<br/>
bank for just this purpose) I went thru Riverdale, where I&#39;d tried to get a<br/>
bind but there were only six people in the zone, none of which had the bind<br/>
capability, and the rest of my group were still back in EK. Made it back -<br/>
no evil eyes through the gorge (whew), looted my corpse and rejoined the<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
Death number 2: We were fighting Undead Reavers and Gnoll Reavers and our<br/>
runner brought several which also brought a griffawn.... usually we try to<br/>
keep everything in a clump, makes it easier for our two paladins to taunt<br/>
them away, but for some reason at least half of them went after me,<br/>
including the Griffawn - mind you, most of the things he brings back are<br/>
blue and up to me - mostly yellow and red, as my party mostly consisted of<br/>
19s and 20s with the exception of me (15) and another paladin who was also<br/>
15. Then a couple of wolves joined in the fray. Anyway, I tried to run, but<br/>
five things were hitting me for at least 20-40 damage a whack.... &quot;you have<br/>
been slain by an undead reaver&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Sigh* Okay, relearn songs and get one of my other drums (I actually own<br/>
four as Friday I died once and Saturday I died twice and really didn&#39;t want<br/>
to run slowly). Then I head back out from Freeport. East Commons, West<br/>
Commons.... I run by the first derv camp on the way to kith zone.... I run<br/>
very close by, too closely by, what I think is an ogre hunting at the camp,<br/>
but NO.... it&#39;s a derv and a huge red one to me... hitting a little<br/>
defenseless nekkid bard.... ack... why is selos not outrunning him???? DEAD<br/>
(I almost made it to the zone too). I get back to Freeport only to find that<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the run key on -ARGH - what? I lost my level !!?!! ARGGGGGH.<br/>
This is when I realize that when you die, run goes back to walk, and I<br/>
didn&#39;t know that...... what a way to learn it tho... grrrrrrrrr<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, my L20 enchanter husband is on, and in freeport doing some<br/>
working on his jeweler skill, so he agrees to help me run back to the group<br/>
and help me get my level back. I temporarily disband from orig group and<br/>
party up with him (for fast feet purposes). We run all the way to Riverdale<br/>
with no problems... he binds me there... and then we get to the gorge.......<br/>
we start to run fast thru it, but there are a couple of minotaurs and evil<br/>
eyes which someone is training and they&#39;re coming our way so we have to zone<br/>
back into runnyeye... we try it again and he decides we should invis<br/>
ourselves. As Selos makes the invis wear off, we end up having to run<br/>
slowly... but his invis wears off right as an evil eye spawns... i&#39;m ahead<br/>
of him, and, as he&#39;s sitting at his computer next to me, i hear him say,<br/>
&quot;ack, go! go! get to the zone&quot;, I peek over and see what&#39;s after him, then<br/>
hear him say to himself, &quot;ack, 32 points of damage, 44, ouch.. c&#39;mon,<br/>
c&#39;mon... almost there&quot;, and we barely make it to the zone.....  WHEW!<br/>
<br/>
NO MORE DYING!!! I think to myself.... We get back, I loot and we join up<br/>
with them. This is where I decide to stand back and help the party by just<br/>
singing Hymn with my lute and bellowing at the bad guys, maybe even singing<br/>
the wince song should it be necessary... and also throwing in a weave of<br/>
Anthem to help with the attack speed and such.... hmmm... doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>
they need my melee much at all :) I get my level back right away and help<br/>
two others who level fairly quickly (adding my husband to the party did help<br/>
too, as both he and another spellcaster had pets - so we had, in effect, 6+<br/>
2pets to fight them with). We end on a happy note 3 people level and all can<br/>
go to bed as its late.<br/>
<br/>
Whew :) Sweet Dreams.... One last note: Don&#39;t play when you&#39;re tired... you<br/>
make too many mistakes that way..... :)<br/>
