<div id="ygrps-yiv-511132433">I think there is a difference that I noticed a little while ago with my<br/>
bronzeplate armor.  I unequiped my two bracers that provide AC8 (I think)<br/>
and took a look at my AC total and it dropped by 15 points.  Of course<br/>
this is just a guess but it is possible that the material value is<br/>
factored into the AC total, so a piece of AC5 mesh(like chain) adds 8 to<br/>
your overall AC and AC5 plate adds 10 to your overall AC.  Thereby making<br/>
it quite viable to go for a full suit of plate armor, since this will tip<br/>
the scales in your favour for damage resists.  Can anyone verify this<br/>
hypothesis?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; was like night and day, and in my <br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion still is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>
&gt; material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of say 5<br/>
&gt; and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material makes<br/>
&gt; the difference. </span></blockquote></div>
