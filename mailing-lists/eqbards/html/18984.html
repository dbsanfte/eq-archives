&gt; When we broke in, we cleared to the first bridge and were fighting a froog<br/>
&gt; when a Shroom (myconid warrior? reever?) appeared out of nowhere. He got<br/>
&gt; messed and we kept fighting.  Then another shroom. And another, and another<br/>
&gt; and we ran back to the zone for ease of CR.  Some managed to camp out,<br/>
&gt; cleric gated, a few died inc me.  But my question is - what causes these<br/>
&gt; Shrooms to agro?  This is the second time I have seen this in this same spot<br/>
&gt; with about the same results. And we were careful not to use an AE - just<br/>
&gt; doing the normal kill froog thing.  Anyone know?  Anyone been to the lower<br/>
&gt; levels in Seb?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A very similar thing happened to us at the bridge area both yesterday<br/>
and the day before but in our case it was ilis and krup frogs that<br/>
popped in. They obviously broke something when they fixed the various<br/>
pathing exploits people found in there in the last patch, because we&#39;d<br/>
been fighting there many times before the patch without this happening.<br/>
Of course, because this bug in no way benefits players, don&#39;t hold your<br/>
breath waiting for it to be fixed.<br/>
