&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks everyone for all the input.  I now have a couple of <br/>
&gt; goals for the<br/>
&gt; near term (it&#39;s much more fun to play when you have some objective). <br/>
&gt; First I&#39;ll concentrate on getting level 8 (I&#39;m halfway there <br/>
&gt; now), then<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll head over to either Queynos or Kelethin (from Freeport) <br/>
&gt; to get the<br/>
&gt; Kelin&#39;s Lament song.  I&#39;ve travelled to Kelethin many times to sell<br/>
&gt; small patchwork.  It&#39;s a pretty easy, but very boring, trip.  <br/>
&gt; That boat<br/>
&gt; trip is a killer.  First wait up to 20 minutes for the boat, then<br/>
&gt; another 20 riding the boat.  What fun.  With Selo&#39;s is travelling to<br/>
&gt; Queynos a better or worse plan?  I have maps, but I&#39;ve never actually<br/>
&gt; made the trip.  I&#39;m only familiar with the area from West Karanas to<br/>
&gt; Queynos.  I&#39;ve thought about doing a poor man&#39;s gate to get back.  Put<br/>
&gt; all my stuff in the bank and then commit suicide.  (Isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; reincarnation<br/>
&gt; great?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The boat ride is my time to practice skills. At your level, sense heading<br/>
and fishing were the skills I practiced. I also chatted with others on the<br/>
trip or just went and got something to drink or read a newspaper or<br/>
something if I didn&#39;t want to press keys.<br/>
<br/>
fishing can be done from a moving boat, but I find you have to move around<br/>
and try casting from different spots. You&#39;ll get your fair share of messages<br/>
saying you can&#39;t, but it gave me something to do. Also, if you have a<br/>
musical skill that isn&#39;t maxed out, it&#39;s a good time to practice.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once I have lament, I&#39;ll try to join some orc camping parties in East<br/>
&gt; Commonlands.  I joined my first party a couple of nights ago and had a<br/>
&gt; blast, although I died a lot.  I got the distinct feeling <br/>
&gt; that the orcs<br/>
&gt; hated me the most when I had my drum equipped, whether I was <br/>
&gt; playing or<br/>
&gt; not.  Perhaps it was just my imagination or a conincidence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the hard thing will be balancing the need to save money for a<br/>
&gt; combine weapon and using money to build up my smithing skills (lvl 43<br/>
&gt; right now).  I really want to be a master smith too, which is why I<br/>
&gt; chose to start in Freeport.  I think I&#39;ll go the route of the smith,<br/>
&gt; then once I can make/sell banded I can buy the combine weapon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The trade skills are pretty much a money sink, except for, perhaps<br/>
jewelcraft.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve put in hundreds of pp in smithing to get to the point where I can make<br/>
banded reliably. 50 pp doesn&#39;t go far into training to make armor. There&#39;s<br/>
also not a huge demand for banded anymore on my server, Bertox.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend saving your money and use it towards the combine sword. You&#39;ll<br/>
get the sword much faster just saving the money then trying to make banded.<br/>
<br/>
However, if money is not a goal, then trade skills are a way to role play a<br/>
bit more. I can&#39;t say learning the trade is all that fun and is downright<br/>
boring.<br/>
