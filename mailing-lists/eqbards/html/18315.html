<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287741870">I saw the following on everlore&#39;s main page:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bard Song level 49 Still Missing!! there is still a problem with <br/>
&gt; bard song for the 49th level.  It&#39;s not in game. Please fix!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a 49th level song at this time, and it looks like there<br/>
might not be one. We&#39;ve used the rest of the cool ideas that people<br/>
had on the 51+ songs, where bards get two per level. I&#39;m certainly<br/>
willing to listen to suggestions though and talk them over with GZ. As<br/>
it is now, we could throw a song together just for the sake of putting<br/>
one in, but it wouldn&#39;t be cool.<br/>

They&#39;ve used the rest of the cool ideas?  Did they use any of the cool<br/>
ideas this group came up with in March?  Just curious.  Being a bard<br/>
of only 12 songs, I&#39;m not really very familiar with any of the new<br/>
songs.  Heck, I&#39;m not extremely familiar with most of the old songs.<br/>
