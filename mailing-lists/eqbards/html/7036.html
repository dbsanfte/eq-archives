&gt; a) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt; monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?  Is this<br/>
&gt; intentional or a bug?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure what you guys are missing, but Pixie Strike works *quite* well for<br/>
me against players - just like against NPCs, time it right, and the player ends<br/>
up stunned and interrupted in their cast.  Lullaby has a lesser effect, but also<br/>
<br/>
works.  In fact, the only song that doesn&#39;t really seem to do anything to<br/>
players is Kelin&#39;s Lament, other than giving them the &quot;You feel a sense of<br/>
loss&quot; message. :)<br/>
