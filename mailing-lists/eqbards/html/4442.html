<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613423222">Actually on Solusek Ro there was a gm event last nightthat has to do<br/>
with the DE. In West FP a mage summoned a skeleton for a pet then<br/>
dissapeared, and the pet promptly slew everything within the mage<br/>
guild(I watched as it happened). For a while it just stood there till a<br/>
high level paladin on our server slew it, and then the mage reappeared<br/>
again. He spoke of the Ilkath Zan, a DE society who was watching us with<br/>
their agents, about how they gave him that book in the form a human,<br/>
hoping he would cast its spell, that they were watching us as we spoke,<br/>
and that those who helped slay the skelton were doomed(yay for me).<br/>
After the undead battle we had fought(and considering all the deaths,<br/>
and how one mob escaped) we lost in sro past sunday I feel that there is<br/>
something brewing in those gms mind.<br/>

&gt; Yes there is probably an underlying story brewing slowly here.  One which we<br/>
&gt; bards may play more of a part in than we know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmm, kinda like all those Dark Elves are agents of some great conspiracy...<br/>
&gt; Good thing we have our own agents spreading out now to keep an eye on their<br/>
&gt; doings...  Heh heh heh<br/>

&gt; &gt;Nixx in Paw<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lord Grimlot in South Karana ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;These are all, to my knowledge, Dark Elf Shadowknights.  Anyone who<br/>
&gt; mentions<br/>
&gt; &gt;something about being part of &quot;The Dead&quot; is.  Other than the fact that the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dark Elves have a known alliance with the Crushbone Orcs, I cant help you<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the rest... though it seems logical that they also have an alliance<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the DeathFist orcs and the Gnolls.... it seems to me they have an<br/>
&gt; &gt;unusally high presence in High Pass as well, which makes me wonder if they<br/>
&gt; &gt;are conspiring with the leader of High pass?  Things that make you go<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmmmmm.<br/>
