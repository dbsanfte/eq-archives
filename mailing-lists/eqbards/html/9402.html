<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706144197">Well i got my first Lambent stone last night. I had all the other pieces<br/>
but that, and several people had offered to sell for 100 plat, but i<br/>
told them all they would never get it. I got my stone for 15 plat.<br/>
<br/>
The rogues all got together and set pricing for ravenscale, so that<br/>
people would not &quot;farm it&quot;. Why not do the same for Lambent stones? Why<br/>
don&#39;t we all agree to only pay 20 plat or less for the stone. That is a<br/>
nice chunck of change for someone, and not out of the reach of bards<br/>
saving for gems for armor.<br/>
<br/>
what do you think?<br/>
