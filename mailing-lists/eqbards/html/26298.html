<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907344165">I have worked as a game tester for a little over 2 years. Even in that small space of time I have noticed a massive increase in the demand for game tester jobs. Why is this? Because the gaming industry is an absolute monster worth over 20 billion dollars a year and rising, and they need to pay individuals to test unreleased video games before they hit the stores.<br/>
Why Do Game Tester Jobs Exist?<br/>
A gaming company invests millions of dollars in creating a game like Grand Theft Auto 4. They are going to have to fork out a lot more if the game has to be recalled because some punk kid discovers that the game freezes on level 2 when you crash into a shopfront. That&#39;s where game tester jobs come into play.<br/>
Gaming companies are willing to pay keen and motivated gamers to beta test unreleased video games to uncover bugs and issues that could cause the game to be recalled.<br/>
How Easy Is It To Get A Game Tester Job?<br/>
I am not going to lie to you and pretend it&#39;s a walk in the park, but if you make the right connections and are pro-active you will have no difficulty. It took me a few months before I made the right connections. If you are just looking for an easy ride, then go look elsewhere - you need to be a keen gamer and motivated.<br/>
How Much Money Can I Make As A Game Tester?<br/>
The amount of money you can make as a game tester all comes down to the amount of gaming platforms you own and the amount of job&#39;s you apply for. The more gaming platforms you own, the more jobs you can take on. The more video game tester jobs you apply for, the more you will get.<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
A Game tester is a viable job, but there are plenty of scam artists out there who will take your cash and run. You need to be a keen gamer and preferably own a few gaming platforms to succeed in games testing. <br/>
