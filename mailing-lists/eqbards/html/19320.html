<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129162636">*sigh*  As much as the speculation that we are making in how this<br/>
change/option will be implemented, we are all forgetting one fact.....<br/>
None of us have access to the code and hence do not know what needs to be<br/>
done.  Everyone&#39;s points have merit in how such a change can be<br/>
implemented.  So let&#39;s move on.... I would much prefer a nice thread on<br/>
how to power level me to level 40 =)<br/>

&gt; Let me ask this... other than the trade windows, how is the Destroy <br/>
&gt; button and droping action any different?  Did they not set a flag on <br/>
&gt; this to bring up a window?(If the option is selected)  Is this not a <br/>
&gt; client side option?  You guys are making this seem more complicated <br/>
&gt; than it is.  How does it effect the entire game engine?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I can see this option.  Trade/Drop items: On, Off, Confirm.  <br/>
&gt; They have already done it similarly with the destroy button.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;So be it.  Personally, I hate opening trade windows because of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;space between the Melee/Inventory slots.  Besides, remember, this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;will be a client side personal choice.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; umm, what makes you think that any of these hooks are set up on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; client side?<br/>
