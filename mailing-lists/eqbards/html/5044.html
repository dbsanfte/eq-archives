&gt; I think there is a difference that I noticed a little while ago with my<br/>
&gt; bronzeplate armor.  I unequiped my two bracers that provide AC8 (I think)<br/>
&gt; and took a look at my AC total and it dropped by 15 points.  Of course<br/>
&gt; this is just a guess but it is possible that the material value is<br/>
&gt; factored into the AC total, so a piece of AC5 mesh(like chain) adds 8 to<br/>
&gt; your overall AC and AC5 plate adds 10 to your overall AC.  Thereby making<br/>
&gt; it quite viable to go for a full suit of plate armor, since this will tip<br/>
&gt; the scales in your favour for damage resists.  Can anyone verify this<br/>
&gt; hypothesis?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was like night and day, and in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion still is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of<br/>
say 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material<br/>
makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the difference.<br/>
