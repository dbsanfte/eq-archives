<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043204207"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; welcome in groups because the general idea is that they have solo&#39;d their<br/>
&gt; way through the levels, etc. (That doesn&#39;t effect me. I only play<br/>
&gt; my druid when my friend is around and I always play with her same-<br/>
&gt; level monk. Then we see what else we can gather. But a lot of time<br/>
&gt; its just the two of us.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll be honest.  I started a druid because I was tired of feeling<br/>
  so weak as a bard.  I also only play him when my similiar level <br/>
  friend is around.  SoW is too slow, mana constraints bite, melee<br/>
  is much more horrible.  However, I can stroll into any place my <br/>
  bard would go and in solo mode perform 3x or 4x better.  I actually<br/>
  went from L16 to L17 all on my own soloing in one night.  It was<br/>
  very refreshing.  Boring, but a change of pace.<br/>
<br/>
  My druid is almost L21 but I havent played him much because I love<br/>
  my bard.  There are times when I&#39;d like to press a few buttons and<br/>
  kill things quickly.  That was something my bard could never do.<br/>

  and Dagato Catnip!  lol...   hope you don&#39;t mind, Cat - it was pure<br/>
                               admiration, not a lack of creativity.</div>
