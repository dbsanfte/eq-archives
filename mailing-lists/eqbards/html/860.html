    Subject: [eqbards] higher level songs<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i have not purchased level 29 psalm of vitality or level 37 psalm of purity because the only info i have seen on them is that they increase SV for disease and poison.  i never found these very useful, and also found it strange that two songs, both high level, would have this effect.  does anyone have any actual experience using them?<br/>
    <br/>
    also, level 35 denon&#39;s dissension, i have bought and used, though i don&#39;t really know what effect it is having on the targets.  i guess it could just be an exact upgrade of level 18 denon&#39;s disruptive discord, but if anyone knows it&#39;s true effects i&#39;d love to know if it does anything different.<br/>
