&gt; &gt; Not to mention neither Druids nor Shamans can really fight in Melee...<br/>
&gt; &gt; We can still pretend we do...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Nor will they ever, if I see a druid/cleric/shaman meleeing<br/>
&gt;   I tell them to sit their ass down.  They have no business<br/>
&gt;   swinging for an average 10dmg per round.  More often than <br/>
&gt;   not, I dont have every buff or am completely healed, so I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;   rather them perform the job we hired them for then attempt <br/>
&gt;   to melee.  In my own immortal words:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you hate sitting down so much, then you picked the wrong class =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll miss out on any of the better druids then. Playing the way you<br/>
ask is suicidal in the long run for cleric types, as it means your<br/>
offence and defence skills stagnate, as you never get a chance to get<br/>
improvements. This means when they get the inevitable frenzy occurs from<br/>
casting that heal they get ripped up because they have such low defence.<br/>

&gt;   As for pretending to melee, I do on occasion outdmg rangers and<br/>
&gt;   paladins.  Double Yks with 205 DEX and SLTW and I almost<br/>
&gt;   always outdmg them.  Don&#39;t underestimate our melee potential.<br/>
&gt;   We are by no means the best, but we contribute easily 25% of<br/>
&gt;   melee damage in most battles (when properly equiped, assuming<br/>
&gt;   three tanks, three casters).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cough cough. Double attack mean anything to you? I think you&#39;ll find a<br/>
similarly equipped ranger would make your melee look like the joke it<br/>
is.<br/>
