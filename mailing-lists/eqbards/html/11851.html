&gt;<br/>
&gt;How here&#39;s a little tale - I&#39;ve got to tell<br/>
&gt;About three bad bards - you know so well<br/>
&gt;It started way back in Norrath history<br/>
&gt;With Sylly, Operaman, and me - Harmy.<br/>
&gt;Been had a little druid was the teleporteer<br/>
&gt;Just me and my treehugger and a cold short beer<br/>
&gt;Warping across the land - kicking up sand<br/>
&gt;Mayong&#39;s posse on my tail cause I&#39;m in demand<br/>
&gt;One lonely Bardie I be<br/>
&gt;All by myself - without nobody<br/>
&gt;The sun is beating down on my lambent blue hat<br/>
&gt;My blood is gettin&#39; hot - the beer is getting flat<br/>
&gt;Lookin&#39; for a woodelf - I ran into a guy<br/>
&gt;His name is Operaman, I said, &quot;Howdy&quot; - he said, &quot;Hi&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed<br/>
&gt;Four days using Selo&#39;s and that he&#39;s dying of thirst<br/>
&gt;The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip<br/>
&gt;His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip<br/>
&gt;He said, &quot;Can I get some?&quot;<br/>
&gt;I said, &quot;You can&#39;t get none!&quot;<br/>
&gt;Had a chance to flee<br/>
&gt;He pulled out his wakashi<br/>
&gt;He was quick on the draw - I thought I&#39;d be dead<br/>
&gt;He put the sword to my head and this is what he said,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Now my name is Operaman - I&#39;ve got a license to kill<br/>
&gt;I think you know what time it is - it&#39;s time to get ill<br/>
&gt;Now what do we have here - an bardie and his beer<br/>
&gt;I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.&quot;<br/>
&gt;We stepped into the wind - he had a blade, I had a grin<br/>
&gt;You think this story&#39;s over but it&#39;s ready to begin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Now I got the weapon - you got the brew<br/>
&gt;You got two choices of what you can do<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not a tough decision as you can see<br/>
&gt;I can slice you to shreads or you can group with me&quot;<br/>
&gt;I said, I&#39;ll group with you if<br/>
&gt;you can get me to the zone<br/>
&gt;The vampire&#39;s after me for what I did to his crone.<br/>
&gt;I did it like this - I did it like that<br/>
&gt;I did it with a charmed sonic bat<br/>
&gt;So I click on run - and equip my drum<br/>
&gt;And right about now - it&#39;s time to have some fun<br/>
&gt;The Queen Sylly - that is my name<br/>
&gt;And I know the sweet spot where they got the champagne.&quot;<br/>
&gt;We ran for six hours the we hit the spot<br/>
&gt;The exp was a pumping and the elfies was hot<br/>
&gt;This dude was staring like he knows who we are<br/>
&gt;We took the empty spot next to him at the bar<br/>
&gt;Operaman said, &quot;Yo, you know this kid?&quot;<br/>
&gt;I said, &quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; - but I know he did<br/>
&gt;The kid said, &quot;Get ready cause this ain&#39;t funny<br/>
&gt;My name&#39;s Harmonic and I&#39;m about to get money.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Pulled out the Ykesha - aimed it at the sky<br/>
&gt;He yelled, &quot;Stick &#39;em up!&quot; - and procs did fly<br/>
&gt;Hands went up and people hit the floor<br/>
&gt;He slayed two kids that ran for the door<br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;m Harmonic and I get respect<br/>
&gt;Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect&quot;<br/>
&gt;Operaman was with it and he&#39;s my ace<br/>
&gt;So I grabbed the guano harvester and I punched him in the face<br/>
&gt;The harvester&#39;s out - the cloak wasn&#39;t dropped<br/>
&gt;His body had jack - save the bag that plopped<br/>
&gt;Harmonic grabbed the bag - Operaman snatched the gold<br/>
&gt;I killed two kobolds and a drank my beer that was cold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Harm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
