<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On a side note, does anyone think that drinking alcohol should affect<br/>
&gt;(either positively or negatively) the effects of bards songs?  As it stands<br/>
&gt;right now, it mainly improves STR and STA and decreases INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>
&gt;The decrease in DEX already has a negative impact on a bards ability to play<br/>
&gt;an instrument.  However, IMO it would be nice if your CHR went up while you<br/>
&gt;were drunk or duration of songs was increased.  It would definately add a<br/>
&gt;twist to roleplaying a bard.  Just a thought...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, while I think that there should be some kind of benefit to being<br/>
drunk with a high Alcohol Tolerance, I&#39;m not sure that a CHR boost is the<br/>
answer. Hehe. I mean, do you know ANYONE who&#39;s more attractive when they&#39;re<br/>
drunk? <br/>
<br/>
The STR and STA is a beneficial increase, especially for we bard weaklings.<br/>
If you could get a greater increase by drinking more (and a high tolerance<br/>
that prevented the swaying and DEX and AGI decrease) then I think every<br/>
bard would have a good reason for being a heavy drinker!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I hear heavy drinking causes liver damage....*chuckles*<br/>
