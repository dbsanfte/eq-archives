<b>Subject:</b> RE: Hey this sounded interesting.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590070021">I am going to make some speculations into Verant&#39;s logic (some may claim<br/>
this is an oxymoron ;-&gt; ) as to why they gave some classes bind and others<br/>
not.  First, I want to make one point: most deaths occur 2 to 3 zones from<br/>
the bind point.  In cases where the character reloads more than 3 zones<br/>
away, there is generally a safe bind point within 3 zones where the player<br/>
could have been bound.  I recognize that there are some few zones -- all in<br/>
the South of Antonica -- where safe binding points are farther away, but in<br/>
almost all cases the above is true.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Yes, I know, everyone has a sob story about dying 17 zones away from<br/>
their bind point when they couldn&#39;t get a bind in Highpass/Rivervale/Erudin,<br/>
but those are rare exceptions.  I have never had any trouble getting bound<br/>
where I need to with a little patience, good humor, and a little cash.<br/>
<br/>
With those points made, I believe that Verant gave magic-users and priests<br/>
the ability to bind anywhere because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a<br/>
corpse can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly 40% less<br/>
effective in melee combat because of their reduced OFF/DEF, and priests are<br/>
down 20%, and neither group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
Having played a wizard up to the mid-teens before becoming a full-time bard,<br/>
I can tell you how hard it can be for a naked wizard to handle a tough blue<br/>
that has latched onto you when you are making the run-of-shame to your<br/>
corpse -- and this is with the best root and DD spells in the business.  <br/>
<br/>
For a melee class, the run is an inconvenience, but without nearly as much<br/>
risk, as you can either outrun any problems that may arise (bards), hide and<br/>
sneak from them (rogues), or have enough varied attacks that do not rely<br/>
upon weapons alone that you can defend yourself adequately (warriors, monks,<br/>
et.al.).  <br/>
<br/>
The argument I make is that there is a compelling need for magic-users and<br/>
priests to be able to bind and bind anywhere.  That need is not present for<br/>
fighters and hybrids; rather, it would simply be a convenient ability to<br/>
have.     <br/>
<br/>
With all the work that Verant has done to balance the various classes, I do<br/>
not believe that one can reasonably expect them to make this major change to<br/>
the game without a compelling need.  I believe that it is also important to<br/>
consider the outcry Verant would get from the seven classes that can bind if<br/>
they let everyone bind.  Can&#39;t you already hear Namby Pamby the Necromancer<br/>
shouting across the zone about how badly Verant nerfed the casters, and how<br/>
they are owed some special &#39;hot death from above&#39; spell to offset the loss?<br/>
<br/>
My parting thought is this: sure I&#39;d love to have bind.  I&#39;d also like to be<br/>
the flying cuisinart of death, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;ve been endowed<br/>
by my creators with a wide variety of marvelous abilities (most of which<br/>
work), but bind is not one of them.  Being adaptable, I make do with what I<br/>
have, and frankly, I do pretty well.<br/>
