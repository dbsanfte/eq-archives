<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314492390"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;A level 31 friend reported getting experience grouped with a<br/>
&gt;45, but not a 46.  My guess is it caps out at a 16 level<br/>
&gt;delta. That is, a level 35 player grouped with a level 50<br/>
&gt;would get exp, but a level 34 would not.  At the low end, a<br/>
&gt;level 1 player will not get experience with a level 5 (4 level<br/>
&gt;delta).  Everything else in the middle is a gradual scale<br/>
&gt;between these two deltas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I recall at GenCon Brad said it was basically (lvl/10 rounded down)* 5<br/>
for exp gaining range with the exception being the lower levels.  That would<br/>
seem to fit the data.  At 10-19 5 levels range.  At 20-29, 10 lvls.  30-39,<br/>
15 lvls.  The lower level person sets the range apparently.  Presumably then<br/>
at 40-49, 20 levels which might be verifiable if the level limit gets<br/>
raised.<br/>
