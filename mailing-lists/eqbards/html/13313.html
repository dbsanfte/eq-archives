<div id="ygrps-yiv-730295456">replying to myself.  along these lines, i will say against melee i have<br/>
never won, which included level 50 warrior, paladin, and several rangers.<br/>
probably because i don&#39;t kite them and stand there and get beat on like a<br/>
punching bag.  and didn&#39;t mean to sound like i was on an ego trip with those<br/>
wins i&#39;ve had against casters, i just really enjoy killing them =)<br/>

&gt; a jerk and stupid too i guess =)  no way you&#39;d be stunning me <br/>
&gt; while playing<br/>
&gt; MR songs, which i always have going before accepting the duel <br/>
&gt; =)  DoTs and<br/>
&gt; DDs get through, but all or none spells, like root or stun <br/>
&gt; etc, almost never<br/>
&gt; do.  50 v 50 with me having 120+ MR it&#39;s not gonna happen ;)  <br/>
&gt; never tried a<br/>
&gt; necro yet, too scared.  but level 50 enchanter, cleric, shaman, druid,<br/>
&gt; wizard, magician i have all beat in duels.<br/>
