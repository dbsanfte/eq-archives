<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375562051">Is it just me or is Soerbairds guild a rip off....I really want to know<br/>
why the heck it costs 10plat plus a monthly fee to join...thats a load<br/>
of Bull crap.....I was going to join but then i found i had better<br/>
things to do than pay to those greedy rogues....If you give me enough<br/>
information on that guild and why it costs so much then i might join it<br/>
until then.....keep begging Soerbairds.<br/>
