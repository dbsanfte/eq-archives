<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I highly doubt they remove the meditate limit or give us the ability<br/>
  to receive benefit from clarity type effects.  I think that was your<br/>
  point anyway, it&#39;s not going to happen.  I agree that 75% of our new<br/>
  songs should be manaless, just like the bulk of our songs now.  The<br/>
  problem is, I&#39;m tired of just getting the &#39;next Anthem&#39; or the &#39;next<br/>
  Heal&#39; or the &#39;next Resistance song&#39;.  Original ideas like the ones<br/>
  I have seen are unique and very powerful.  They need a check put in<br/>
  so that the Bard is not just constantly using these most powerful <br/>
  songs.  I&#39;m not saying all songs take a full bar, or take 1 bubble.<br/>
  Songs can taken 20 mana per tick, (20m/6s) = 300s worth of time at<br/>
  full mana (~1000 mana), for example.<br/>
<br/>
  Songs like that sacrifice song are self-checking.  You die, your<br/>
  party gains benefit.  Dirge is a joke, and I hate to sound like<br/>
  a broken record but Dirge at L43 is the equivalent of a L20ish<br/>
  wizard dumping full mana into AE.  The only thing desparate, again,<br/>
  is the damage done.  This song takes up to an hour to mana cycle.<br/>
  (And no, Shada, I&#39;m not a caster, I don&#39;t sit my bard down ever)<br/>
  It takes an hour for 90%+ of the bard population to regain mana for<br/>
  this song, because I know I have hidden my &#39;Sit&#39; button since I <br/>
  don&#39;t use it.  Needless to say the song is a waste.  It requires<br/>
  mana, but for the wrong reason.<br/>
<br/>
  There was the rumor of a high level bard song which stopped time.<br/>
  Something like that would absolutely take mana.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t want to be stuck with Verses of Victory II at L60.  I want<br/>
  some very distinct songs, and I just get the feeling that isn&#39;t <br/>
  going to happen.  Let&#39;s also assume Verant aren&#39;t complete idiots,<br/>
  and we continue to receive one song per level.  Here is what I<br/>
  predict:<br/>
<br/>
  L51 - upgrade to hymm<br/>
  L52 - upgrade to lullaby<br/>
  L53 - upgrade to clouding<br/>
  L54 - upgrade to some useless AE like DDD, LMB<br/>
  L55 - upgrade to clarit<br/>
  L56 - upgrade to psalm line<br/>
  L57 - upgrade to charm<br/>
  L58 - not implemented<br/>
  L59 - upgrade to verses of victory<br/>
  L60 - not implemented<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s sad, but I just don&#39;t see them doing anything that requires a whole<br/>
  lot of effort.  Look at the other classes new spells, there&#39;s really <br/>
  nothing new about them.  They are just upgrades to existing spells.<br/>
  I couldn&#39;t find any really new power anyone was given.  Except maybe<br/>
  that single target kill series, but that requires a gem component, and<br/>
  then becomes extremely limited in use.<br/>
<br/>
  So if I can get a song that makes me a badass at the cost of mana,<br/>
  but gets me into more parties because of the talent, I&#39;m for it.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
  I think I&#39;m gonna sign with that DMB quote each time, it fits us<br/>
  perfecly.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;What I want is what I&#39;ve not got,<br/>
   What I need is all around me.&quot;     -Jimi Thing, Dave Matthews Band.</div>
