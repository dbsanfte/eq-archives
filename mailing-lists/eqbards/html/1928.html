<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659852882">This happens to me alot, but only since the patch that was recently put in. I&#39;ll<br/>
paint a gruesome picture for you - L19 Bard witha  group 18-21, I&#39;m in the<br/>
Unrest mansion pulling red cons. You finally get a nice barbed for your group,<br/>
sprint down the stairs ahead of the mob, click the door and...it doesn&#39;t open.<br/>
None of the doors...will open. As you frantically sprint about trying to find a<br/>
door opened by someone else, to no avail, you eventually succumb. Theis happened<br/>
twice, although only the second time was I inside with a pull when I realized<br/>
the server had gone out of sync. The first time I had tried opening the door to<br/>
go in, couldn&#39;t, then turned around and noted 30+ people had all &quot;dissappeared&quot;.<br/>
Although I camped, it of course locks up my computer and I have to either<br/>
alt+tab out and force quit EverQuest or I have to force reboot.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the boat issue, a friend and I came from Freeport, got off at the BB<br/>
dock, but she crashed while experimenting with binding someone at the dock. She<br/>
logged back in on the boat going to Freeport. My guess is they changed the code<br/>
to start you on the boat if you crash instead of in the water. It isn&#39;t common<br/>
for me, if I crash zoning, to end up several hundred yards from the zone either.<br/>
One time in Freeport I even started on top of the walls.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope they nail down the cause of this soon, I petitioned a GM regarding<br/>
the Unrest issue after my second death realted to it, and he lauughed at me<br/>
asking what I was doing there if I didn&#39;t know how to open doors (GM Bagash,<br/>
Karana). Who says all EQ GMs aren&#39;t as arrogant and rude as a number of those<br/>
found in UO? *frowns*<br/>
