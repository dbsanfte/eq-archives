As it happens either Sunday or Saturday (I forget) I did a damage song<br/>
analysis with a friend.  It&#39;s the first time either of us has tried a duel.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a human bard and just made 18th level.  My friend is a human cleric and<br/>
is more than half way through 19th level.  We had a lot of fun dueling and<br/>
eventually doing a bit of measuring of damage song effects.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;d indeed dueled to the death, he&#39;d have lost.  I found it easier to<br/>
hit on the techniques that worked than he did.  His spells had trouble<br/>
effecting me and didn&#39;t hold for long.  My spells, and my combine long and<br/>
dragoon dirk, caused him considerable trouble.  When we quit fighting,<br/>
partly because someone trained a sand giant on us, I was at 3 bubbles of<br/>
health and he was at about 1.<br/>
<br/>
His most effective technique was to blind me, so I couldn&#39;t see to weave<br/>
songs and instruments or I couldn&#39;t stay facing him with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I tried weaving Chords, Denon&#39;s, and healing, swapping instruments.  Even<br/>
with a lot of trouble starting Denon&#39;s, the combination is indeed deadly.<br/>
When I couldn&#39;t swap instruments, I could guess timing and swap songs with<br/>
hot keys.  If he was close enough to hit me with a weapon, he was getting<br/>
hurt.  And he complained that I healed too fast.  :-)}<br/>
<br/>
As to numbers, we found Chords doing 3 damage per tick without my lute and<br/>
7 with it.  Denon&#39;s was 4 just sung and 10 with horn.  He noted that if he<br/>
didn&#39;t resist he got hit for at least 3 ticks.  So a good shot with Denon&#39;s<br/>
would hit him for 30.  If I got it all woven together, which was hard,<br/>
every tick he&#39;d take 17 damage and I&#39;d heal myself for 7.  It works.<br/>
<br/>
He was quite the gentleman about it.  He camped first.<br/>
<br/>
	Thrush has defeated Levi in a duel to the death.  Levi has run away<br/>
	like a cowardly dog.<br/>
<br/>
Practically speaking, when I&#39;ve fought deepwater caimans in Oasis with<br/>
combine long and dragoon dirk, weaving Warsong and healing, I&#39;ve often had<br/>
to run from them when they got too far up on me.  Doing the same without<br/>
even hitting, just weaving the three songs with instrument swapping I<br/>
killed a dw caiman and had 3-4 bubbles of health at the end.<br/>
<br/>
I must give Verant credit for making bards so effective with song and<br/>
instrument and not even using melee attack.<br/>
