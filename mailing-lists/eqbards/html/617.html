<div id="ygrps-yiv-768083964">Beholder is easy. For ANY Bard with a drum and the speed song. Just run,<br/>
and don&#39;t stop. You may get attacked by 10 things but you&#39;ll outrun them<br/>
all. There is no getting lost. From East Karana just stay right, from<br/>
Runnyeye just stay left. Once in Runnyeye, from Beholder stay left, from<br/>
Misty Thicket, stay right. Nothing could be easier. I get bound to<br/>
Rivervale and go hunt in Paw, simply because Beholder simply is no threat<br/>
to our class.<br/>
<br/>
Do watch out for the rare Evil Eye . . . he might have time to charm you.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I used to run back and forth from Freeport to Qeynos all the time (for many <br/>
&gt;&gt;different reasons)...sometimes I&#39;d go to Qeynos and return to Freeport the <br/>
&gt;&gt;same day. Accelerando ROCKS!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In another life I made the run from Freeport to Qeynos as a dwarf warrior<br/>
&gt;of the 6th level, in the company of a much higher level group and with the<br/>
&gt;benefit of Spirit of the Wolf for more speed.  It was somewhat of an ordeal<br/>
&gt;and I died twice trying to get through the minotaur pass, both times from<br/>
&gt;being stunned and disoriented as I tried to run through.  Without the work<br/>
&gt;and indulgence of the group I wouldn&#39;t have made it.  They even eventually<br/>
&gt;recovered all my belongings from my corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a 10th level bard with a 10th level cleric friend I&#39;m getting more and<br/>
&gt;more interested in wider travel either alone or the two of us, but my fear<br/>
&gt;of the unknown keeps me from it.  It would be helpful to hear of the<br/>
&gt;adventures of other experienced travellers to help set my own expectations<br/>
&gt;properly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My fears are 1) getting lost, and 2) getting in overwhelming trouble from<br/>
&gt;getting into an area that&#39;s just too tough.<br/>
