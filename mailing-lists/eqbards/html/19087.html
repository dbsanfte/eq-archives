charm with little or no problems.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I usually do this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Charm<br/>
&gt; &gt; Off Song<br/>
&gt; &gt; Off Song<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lack of room on my palette usually requires me to sing the same off song<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice, so I try to make it a useful song for the situation. (usually pixie<br/>
&gt; &gt; strike vs high caster concentration areas or snare if there&#39;s no druid.)<br/>
