&gt; &gt; Do you see something wrong with this picture?  Druids can&#39;t<br/>

&gt; No, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with this picture. There was a druid AND a<br/>
&gt; cleric. A cleric CAN use a BI crown (uh oh! acronym!). Both of the people<br/>
&gt; were appropriate level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I read it as two others arrived, each wanting it for<br/>
themselves.  Not as a cleric and druid grouped.  My mistake if<br/>
that was the case.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlikely.  I&#39;ve seen it with Crush (ringmail tunic), the<br/>
Shraloks (halberd), the Mucktails (tomahawk, shield), Cazic<br/>
(rubicite), Mistmoore (shield), Bonecrusher (whip), knight<br/>
(chain tunic and mantle) and on and on.  Usually you can tell<br/>
because the person will immediately auction the item after he<br/>
loots the kill.  The Mistmoore shield incident was pretty bad<br/>
- a mage and a wizard stood there and let a shaman who was<br/>
fighting the shield bearer die despite his pleas for help.  <br/>
The instant he dropped, they both nuked like mad.  And when my<br/>
friends and I checked out the warlord in Runnyeye, it was a<br/>
lone high-level druid who refused to share with us (I didn&#39;t<br/>
know it dropped the crown at the time else I would&#39;ve repeated<br/>
Ariell&#39;s charm performance).<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I don&#39;t hold it against the classes (if I&#39;m reading<br/>
the hostility in your tone right).  It&#39;s the unfortunate<br/>
damage award system Verant has implemented which causes the<br/>
jerks who do this stuff to migrate to the casting classes.  I<br/>
asked one of these folks what he&#39;d do if Verant made it so<br/>
warriors could get the kill most easily, and he said he&#39;d<br/>
scrap his wizard and start a warrior.<br/>
