I&#39;m not exactly on top of their latest drivers since I *rarely* upgrade<br/>
drivers unless I&#39;m having a problem of some kind or I see several people<br/>
stating that the new ones are worth the upgrade.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] [OT] Nvidia Drivers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the OT to everyone who DOESN&#39;T use an Nvidia card - but there<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; a discussion here earlier - so I wanted to give a heads-up to those who<br/>
do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nvidia recently released their Detonator 3 Driver (version 6.18 - man<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; numbering scheme leads to confusion).  Until this update I never had a<br/>
&gt; driver-related problem in EQ - (even with SB-Live that a lot of people<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; had problems with).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once I installed 6.18 and went into EQ - it locked up.  The first time - I<br/>
&gt; tried switching from weaps to Drum - and it locked when I put the drum in<br/>
&gt; the appropriate hand slot.  Rebooted, came back to EQ.  Then did a tell or<br/>
&gt; two - and as soon as I tried to move forward - locked again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to revert to previous drivers (5.33) and no problems.  Beware<br/>
&gt; upgrading drivers...<br/>
