<div id="ygrps-yiv-509109474">Live Side Lower Guk isn&#39;t too bad, but if you want it all to yourself go to<br/>
Kedge Keep.<br/>
<br/>
I went there last night with two groups.  One group of 6 and one group of 5.<br/>
There were 11 people in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that it was one of the most singularly fun times in EverQuest<br/>
I&#39;ve ever had.  Working 100% underwater necessitates some tactical changes<br/>
such as playing Jig in battle and occassionally while medding, having<br/>
Aquatic Ayre memmed, etc., but man.  Serious fun.  Great experience.<br/>
<br/>
After weeks of my &quot;/random 1 100&quot; being something like &#39;7&#39; I finally broke a<br/>
streak and rolled a 98 when we killed the big, mean, nasty shark<br/>
Cauldronboil.  Of the 7 or so non-casters that rolled for the weapon I ended<br/>
up with a Sharkjaw Cutlass (10/33 2.0).  This weapon looks *so* cool as it&#39;s<br/>
curved and serrated, plus it is an improvement on my Brazen Brass Kilij<br/>
(10/35 8.5).<br/>
<br/>
Crier Sharpsong<br/>

PS: Once or twice we had &quot;trains&quot; of swordfish and/or piranha pulled to our<br/>
groups.  The pullers were shouting &quot;SCHOOL!!&quot;<br/>

&gt; SolB is so camped on E&#39;ci the line to get in starts in Nek Forest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lower guk live-side is the place you wanna be, much less camped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read these posts about clearing all the greater kobolds and just<br/>
&gt; chuckle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you can get in to SolB, and are able to pull more than 3 kobolds<br/>
&gt; then go for it, I&#39;m sure the birthday man is right.<br/>
