said I will cjharge 1 pp etcc because I had seen a friend say that and once<br/>
he got the fare to his corpse he just left and did not even pay for it. If<br/>
you make the other person feel that you are helping from the kindness of<br/>
your heart they feel compeled to help you in turn. I once got a Mino Axe and<br/>
a Snakeskin tunic for free like this. Not the 29pp like the other guy but<br/>
still over 10 pp worth if goods.<br/>

&gt; I have never set a price for my services because I find that donations<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; out very well.  When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>
&gt; right away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>
&gt; few levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out for<br/>
&gt; help.  I had to run to the zone with Croon and Froon chasing me but he got<br/>
&gt; his corpse.  After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from<br/>
him.<br/>
&gt; That is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; I have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>
&gt; depending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; invite them and speed them up for no charge.  But if I have to go out of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; way I probably would.<br/>
