50 percent the second try.<br/>

Okay, first off, this advice is coming from research, not from <br/>
success. :)  I had planned to take her down (had 30+ people ready on <br/>
2 seperate occasions), but she didn&#39;t cooperate by spawning...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nearly impossible to stand up and fight her the &quot;normal&quot; EQ <br/>
way.  Her Fear is hard to resist and he slow takes out any melee <br/>
power that isn&#39;t perma-feared.  It&#39;s been said that melee&#39;s HAVE to <br/>
be 58+ to even stand a chance of resisting anything, so LEVEL matters <br/>
much more than resists.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a pre-Velious Dragon, so remember she&#39;s only got 32k hps.  Her <br/>
CH will heal up to 10k.  She&#39;s also an ICE Dragon, who is very <br/>
susceptible to FIRE.  Wizards, Mages, Druids, even Rangers have fire <br/>
based spells.  Gather up as many of those classes as you can, lower <br/>
her FIRE resists a bit for good measure and blow the *&#@ out of <br/>
her.  My plan called for ~20 Wizards, Mages and Druids and she would <br/>
be dead in less than 10 seconds from the first synchronized blast.  <br/>
To do her in this way, you don&#39;t even need much tank support... just <br/>
one 60 Warrior (with some healing support), really, to hold her <br/>
attention so she doesn&#39;t claw apart your nukers while they get into <br/>
position.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. :)<br/>
