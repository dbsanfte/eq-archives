<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There does?  When and where did this ridiculous idea get started?  Back in<br/>
Neverwinter Nights (the original on AOL), the only penalties to dying were:<br/>
<br/>
A.  You were sent back to the nearest zone entrance of the zone you were in<br/>
(Where there was an picture of a gate to the zone next to it, which began<br/>
the term &quot;being gated&quot; or &quot;hitting the gate&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
B.  Any items you didn&#39;t have equipped, you MIGHT lose.<br/>
<br/>
C.  You MAY have to go the the temple in Neverwinter to get any adverse<br/>
spell effects removed (Like a Feeb)<br/>
<br/>
Did this create mayhem and chaos?  Nope.  Did it take away from the<br/>
enjoyment of the game?  Again the answer is no.  It actually ADDED to the<br/>
fun  (I know that&#39;s a hard concept to grab in this time of &quot;game balance&quot;,<br/>
but please try to imagine it).<br/>
<br/>
Would no exp loss ruin the game for folks?  Only for the power-gamers who<br/>
can&#39;t get past the idea that maxxing out their character(s) doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you&#39;ve &quot;won&quot;.    Will this ever be implemented?  No chance in hell.  Why<br/>
bring it up?  Just to throw it out there for discussion (if anyone feels<br/>
inclined to catch it :o)   )<br/>
