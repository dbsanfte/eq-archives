First, I love that we can hit those magic creatures with our fists now.  It always seemed a huge neon sign saying, &#39;look at the fool trying to hurt me&#39;.  I think that was in the FAQ so I guess Talies needs to change that part now. =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a list of good nodrop weapons?  Having &#39;fumbled&#39; my weapons countless time in combat, it dawned on me that at least I&#39;d maybe be a little safer if I had a weapon that reminds me when I accidentally try to drop, &quot;This item can not be dropped, traded or sold!&quot;  The only higher end weapon that I can think of off hand is the EBW (Used acronym because there is no way I am going to spell the W word).  (And on a side note . . . unless they&#39;ve changed it, be VERY careful looting nodrops from your corpse. . . one time my necromancer died, and I was in a hurry to loot and extract revenge.  Well I do the right click on items from corpse to fill inventory, then drop those items onto the picture to wear them.  This time I right clicked one too many times from my corpse and my no drop Pegasus Feather Cloak (rare drop off of rare Quillmane in SK) fell to the ground because my inventory was full . . . unfortunately nodrops can&#39;t fall to the ground so it vaporized.)<br/>
<br/>
I had a theory recently that to improve group efficiency and decrease downtime, I&#39;d try to get a manastone to pass around to the casters.  (I generally group with the same people and trust them).  Well, happened to get a loaner manastone so passed it around when the casters were low on mana, got spammed with them staggering, and then proceeded to play hymn.  It worked okay.  It was not the extraordinary success I was hoping it to be.  I think part of the problem was the caster unfamiliarity with using the stone and not wanting to kill themselves, thus clicking slowly.  And them being a little slow transferring it to the next caster.  I am now looking forward to trying again when I can weave clarity and hymn.  The one major drawback I see is the danger when you are trained and have intentionally weakened and already fragile casters.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, it was mentioned once but haven&#39;t heard anyone else answer.  I was hoping maybe our higher level Tarew Marr bards (Maev or jhenders or any others) might have heard word on the flute that Cazic Thule dropped during the weekend.  And, just speculating that it increases the effect of wind songs . . . well what&#39;s the point?  I can see only two benefits, a better and more consistent charm and pixie strike.  Otherwise most of the wind songs seem all or nothing.  Unless we could take a scowling con to an amiable with Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon =).<br/>
<br/>
Have a good EQ weekend... if you get bored, write your adventures to the list.  I am stuck on an island off the coast of California and my laptop can&#39;t handle EverQuest...  so I am limited to reading about it. =)<br/>
