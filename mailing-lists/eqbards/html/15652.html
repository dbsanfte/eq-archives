<br/>
Here&#39;s one of the messages that I posted in response to a bitchy message<br/>
over in the Lullaby thread:<br/>
<br/>
Bards -<br/>
I think it&#39;s important for us to focus on the one aspect of bards that seems<br/>
to be *bugged*, not flame Verant because you feel that the Bard class is<br/>
underpowered or unbalanced. Those are not the issues that we&#39;re attempting<br/>
to discuss with this thread, and quite frankly issues that I feel are<br/>
incorrect. I absolutely love being a bard. I feel that I&#39;m powerful enough<br/>
and balanced quite well, thank you. However, I would love being a bard a bit<br/>
more if Lullaby worked the way that GZ said on Veeshan that it should.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of multiple nerfs, let&#39;s recap some of our abilities:<br/>
We cover ground much faster than any class in the game. Our spells last<br/>
indefinitely and require no mana. We can cast while running. We have the<br/>
versatility to strengthen our songs by equiping instruments instead of<br/>
weapons. We can duel wield some of the finest weapons in the game. We can<br/>
wear plate, and our armor quests have always worked and yielded quite nice<br/>
(and nice looking) armor. We can tank a bit. We can do some single-mob<br/>
mezzing with Pixie Strike. We get party-wide Clarity that costs no mana to<br/>
cast. We can heal up to 19 HPs a tick (manaless) for all party members and<br/>
at lvl 47+ we can now heal for up to ~35 HPs/tick *for the entire party<br/>
simultaneously and without mana*. We are the only class versatile enough to<br/>
change party buffs *during battle* as the battle flow changes (caster shows<br/>
up, change to MR songs). We can put up party-wide damage shields that are<br/>
also resist enhancers. We get *the best* resist buffs in the game against<br/>
fire, cold and magic making bards irreplacable for dragon raids. We can<br/>
track, hide, sneak and forage. And more...<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentleman. We rock. Period.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t enjoy playing a bard then by all means start playing another<br/>
class. The Bard class is NOT broken. A song&#39;s behavior is.<br/>

&gt; You gripe when they moan about us being able to solo Hill Giants<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you think they feel when you moan about them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stop the vicious circle people.  We&#39;re BARDS </span></blockquote></div>
