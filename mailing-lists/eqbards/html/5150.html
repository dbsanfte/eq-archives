<div id="ygrps-yiv-210141958">Ok overall I&#39;m pretty sure this whole silent nerfing thing is some of you<br/>
getting worked up into a paranoid frenzy.  I checked with my enchanter<br/>
friend and he thinks he might have fizzled all of 2 times last night, but<br/>
noted that after every patch the enchanter boards fill up with this same<br/>
paranoid nonsense that resist rates and fizzle rates have changed, and after<br/>
running a few tests they&#39;re always around where they should be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to run some trials tonight, and I suggest before anyone else makes<br/>
accusations of silent nerfing or any other wonderful conspiracies they do<br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
And a note about the random number generator, it does -seem- it likes long<br/>
strings of failures in a row, but over time, it still comes up statiscally<br/>
correct.<br/>

&gt;Just to add one more glitch to the list...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have the problem of missing notes that often, but when I do, it<br/>
&gt;seems that I miss a lot of them. The other night it took me 6-7 attempts to<br/>
&gt;get Selo&#39;s going, which seems like an awful lot of bad random numbers rolls<br/>
&gt;to get at one time. Luckily this was a non-combat situtation and it just<br/>
&gt;made the rest of my group ridicule me, but hey when you strum a drumstick<br/>
&gt;you get used to that sort of thing.<br/>
