<div id="ygrps-yiv-56586459">I&#39;ve grouped in Sebilis several times between 50-52 - and found Pixie Strike<br/>
to be resisted too much to make it reliable - I pretty much stuck to Charm.<br/>
In groups without Enchanters - I had mixed results - if they knew had to<br/>
control pulls and root etc - went well.<br/>
<br/>
I move around a lot - and spent a lot of time in Karnor and Skyfire to get<br/>
experience.  Also - Raptors in Timourous Deep - while giving next to loot at<br/>
all (runes and words is alls) give great experience.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Bards in Sebilis<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to Sebilis and was thinking of making that my main hangout<br/>
for a while once I get to 51st level.  For those of you with a lot of<br/>
experience hunting in that zone, would like your feedback.  Since all of the<br/>
mobs there will be 45+, I assume Pixie Strike will not be that effective.<br/>
Not certain how well Charm will work.  I know once I get to 53 and get SoT<br/>
then crowd control will be a lot easier.  But until then, how effective will<br/>
I be at performing crowd control in Sebilis?  Would it be smarter to hang<br/>
out in Karnors and other zones until I get to 53 and head to Sebilis then?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
