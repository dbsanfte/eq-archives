<div id="ygrps-yiv-378791430">I&#39;ve been playing EQ since release - and have just dinged to 51.  I have<br/>
never switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn that it&#39;s only<br/>
for the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>
and lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>
<br/>
	Also - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that other people level a<br/>
lot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
	It&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed out for many of<br/>
us - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>
accumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view this as a flame -<br/>
if that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>
personal taste!)<br/>
<br/>
	I pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in down-time.  In certain<br/>
situations I will - but its very much the exception not the rule.  I need to<br/>
do some socializing and rest the fingers!<br/>

<br/>
Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the truely insane.<br/>
I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ is after all a<br/>
social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting constantly.  If<br/>
I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only leaving one song<br/>
playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or guildsay.  So<br/>
tell that monk to relax =)<br/>
