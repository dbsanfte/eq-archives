<b>Subject:</b> Had fun with my new song last night <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943585424">Last night I made 26th level and got to play with the Appalling Screech.  <br/>
Man what a fun song!  My party was in Solesek&#39;s Eye and was about to leave, <br/>
no one else was in the zone so I decided to see how big a train I could <br/>
start with this song.  By the time I left I had over a dozen gobs bouncing <br/>
off me, fleeing in terror!  Then on my way out I came across 3 DE guards at <br/>
the zone to EC, so I feared them to, then shouted to the zone that their <br/>
(the Dark Elves) guards were fleeing in terror from a lone bard, haha.    I <br/>
love being a Bard :)<br/>
