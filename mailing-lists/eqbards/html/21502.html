<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-916809334">Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the <br/>
hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually <br/>
forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play <br/>
Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case <br/>
you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades <br/>
worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>
<br/>
I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just <br/>
adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me <br/>
re-evaluate my line up.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Goodness, people bitch way too much about VI.  What part of, <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in our world now&quot; did you people not understand?  Was that not <br/>
a clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;when you started playing this game?  Max haste was a known bug <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;EVERYONE was exploiting.  They fixed it, get over it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>
