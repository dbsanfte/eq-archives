My guild has been hunting the Allizesaur the last couple<br/>
nights.  Since he&#39;s a consistent L50 mob, it offers a unique<br/>
opportunity to collect data without having to worry about<br/>
level variation in the target.<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary stats for last night&#39;s combat activities (87 str,<br/>
126 dex):<br/>
<br/>
Ykesha (8/24) in primary<br/>
9223 damage<br/>
508 hits (56.0%)<br/>
399 misses (44.0%)<br/>
20 procs unresisted<br/>
22 procs resisted<br/>
avg dam/hit = 18.2<br/>
melee damage = 4.24 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 7.56 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
melee damage + procs = 4.93 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
proc rate = 1 per 51.8 sec<br/>
<br/>
Wakizashi (7/21) in primary<br/>
9006 damage<br/>
551 hits (55.8%)<br/>
437 misses (44.2%)<br/>
avg dam/hit = 16.3<br/>
melee damage = 4.34 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 7.78 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
<br/>
Dragoon dirk (6/23) in secondary<br/>
4932 damage<br/>
654 hits (54.5%)<br/>
547 misses (45.3%)<br/>
65.0% dual wield rate (this sounds way too high)<br/>
avg dam/hit = 7.5<br/>
melee damage = 1.79 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>
melee damage = 3.28 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>
<br/>
As expected, the Wak has a slightly higher damage output over<br/>
time than the Yak, but the difference is probably<br/>
statistically insignificant at 2% (the parser doesn&#39;t<br/>
calculate deviations - I may have to write my own :).  Add in<br/>
the proc from the Yak even with a &gt;50% resist rate (dino was<br/>
red) and the Yak is generating 14% more damage than the Wak,<br/>
which with this sample size probably is statistically<br/>
significant.  So for me, the Yak is clearly the better weapon<br/>
in my primary hand.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll also note that the secondary weapon damage is much<br/>
lower even after you account for the less than 100% dual wield<br/>
activation.  Other studies have found that your secondary<br/>
weapon does not get certain bonuses your primary weapon gets.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me how the parser figures out that my<br/>
character is a L46 wood elf?  I didn&#39;t see that anywhere in<br/>
the logfiles.  :)  And before you ask which parser this is, I<br/>
only used the parser for the total damage, hits, and misses.<br/>
The rest of the values I calculated in a spreadsheet.  The<br/>
parser calculated average damage based on time in combat,<br/>
which doesn&#39;t account for things like PL, target out of range,<br/>
etc.  I normalized it based on hit attempts, then used the<br/>
weapon delay to generate equivalent average damage over time.<br/>
