<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347127169">Pulling to Highpass zone sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling to WC is good and seems the number of mobs there is &#39;ok&#39; even for 2<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling to RV is hard - lots more mobs and higher level mobs - need one<br/>
group of hi30&#39;s to lo 40&#39;s even and 2nd group of lo to mid or mid 30&#39;s -<br/>
then quite nice - lots of mobs and some help.  <br/>
<br/>
When the traveler who could not wait for daybreak pulls the 3 EDW&#39;s and 2<br/>
DC&#39;s into your fight with TH, DH, & RK then you got trouble.<br/>

		&gt; I&#39;ve tried Kith about four different times now, and while<br/>
I&#39;ve been in good<br/>
		&gt; groups, not died, etc., the mob/hour and exp./hour ratio<br/>
is pretty bad.  You<br/>
		&gt; wait for a pull while playing clarity.  Some Ranger or<br/>
Druid is out there<br/>
		&gt; running around.  &quot;Inc!&quot; So you stand up, fight one<br/>
blue/yellow/red mob and<br/>
		&gt; then wait for another pull...  Then 7am rolls around and<br/>
you *sit* for 20<br/>
		&gt; minutes real time.  So all-in-all you might kill 5 or 6<br/>
mobs during the<br/>
		&gt; night if you&#39;re lucky.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really<br/>
seen my exp. move<br/>
		&gt; fighting in the new Kith.<br/>
<br/>
		Hmm.  I didn&#39;t see finding mobs as a big problem with<br/>
		Kithicor.  I&#39;m usually able to keep a steady stream of mobs<br/>
		for my groups to fight.  Just run out to fetch a new one<br/>
		before the one you&#39;re fighting is dead.  When it becomes<br/>
day,<br/>
		let the paladins find undead using their sense undead spell<br/>
-<br/>
		it points them at the nearest undead (which doesn&#39;t work<br/>
when<br/>
		a necro or SK pet is nearby).<br/>
<br/>
		The problem keeping up your mobs/hour ratio in Kithicor is<br/>
		that the mobs are just way too tough for their level.  The<br/>
		harm touches insure you&#39;re going to have at least a minute<br/>
or<br/>
		two of downtime after the fight.  Most of the mobs are<br/>
casters<br/>
		on top of that, and all can debuff or disease you, thus<br/>
		requiring even more downtime.  If a party member gets<br/>
feared,<br/>
		half the time he&#39;s gonna die.<br/>
<br/>
		Another problem is that it&#39;s an outdoor zone.  There are no<br/>
		structured halls for people to find shelter in, so everyone<br/>
		pulls to the zones.  One group screws up, and everyone on<br/>
that<br/>
		side has to get out.  The undead are not very particular<br/>
about<br/>
		who they attack either, so pulling is a problem, as is<br/>
having<br/>
		other people&#39;s pulls jumping on you in a tough fight.<br/>
