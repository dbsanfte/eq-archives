<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814463054">Ok, I cannot speak from personal experience, but have some old friends who<br/>
play on the PvP server, and one is a level 38 bard.  He told me that he is<br/>
&quot;untouchable.&quot;  Shrugged to myself, any PK will tell you they are &quot;elite&quot; or<br/>
some such thing, right?  Another old friend finally bought EQ and then got<br/>
to see the PK Bard in action (killing people), and said he was so impressed<br/>
he almost deleted his (by that point) level 14 paladin.  There aren&#39;t many<br/>
bards, but apparently at higher levels they come into their own and are<br/>
fairly formidable PKs.<br/>

that up for the time being.  Is anyone playing a PvP bard.  Is this<br/>
experience typical?<br/>
