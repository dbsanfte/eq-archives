&gt; P.S.  I was talking to a higher level ranger friend of mine and he asked if<br/>
&gt; I needed any foraged food or water.  I said I forage as well and had plenty<br/>
&gt; thanks.  I got a kick out of his next statement which was &quot;Is there anything<br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t do?!?&quot;  As I said before, gotta love being a bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just explain to him that you have to push the forage button about 150<br/>
times more often to get food than he does and he won&#39;t get quite so<br/>
jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Personally with the success rate of bard&#39;s foraging I find it much<br/>
easier to just buy milk and muffins. Plus they don&#39;t weigh as much or<br/>
take up as many inventory slots as the 5 varieties of foraged food.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, with my druid I&#39;m using forage but passing on the<br/>
endless clicking required to keep sense heading maxed. I will just buy<br/>
him a compass when he&#39;s near a gypsy camp next. :)<br/>
