<b>Subject:</b> Will the Bard get better.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799447630">Hello fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
Man i envy you bards that are in the high 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s,  how did u ever get that high?  I seem to be stuck at lvl 15.  My question is focused at u higher lvl bards.  The question is does the bard get better?  Don&#39;t get me wrong i love my lvl 15 bard but when i comes to dishing out damage in a battle i am weak.  I know the bard class is not designed to be a warrior, but for example, i bought a mino axe at lvl 9,  i still dishes the same amount of damage now at lvl 15 as it did at lvl 9 except for the below song and it only does 8 damage.  I would like to solo eventually but i&#39;m afraid because i have a hard time with creatures that con blue to me.  You high lvl players, is the bard worth the wait?  Will we eventually do more damage and be able to hold our own?  I love the bard class but i also like to know i am a valuable addition to any group.  Higher in lvl&#39;s groups are looking for wizards, tanks, and healers where do we fit in?  Just a little frustrated i guess from dying 3 times in Unrest yesterday...<br/>
<br/>
U higher lvl players post a message with your secrets to success... I need it..hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
