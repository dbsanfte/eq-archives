<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322862229">I suppose that things can go to hell in handbasket next month, but for now, I&#39;m really pleased that I&#39;m on<br/>
Innorruuk.  Our planes scheduling system works very well (see www.innoruuk.com if you&#39;re interested), and<br/>
the larger guilds seem to be cooperating rather nicely on giving each other shots at the big MOBs.  After<br/>
taking VS on Thursday post-first-patch, my guild could have camped there to take him again after the next<br/>
patch, for example, but we knew that Pantheon wanted a shot, so we left (grats on crushing him, btw) and<br/>
took Phinny instead  :)  There are a lot of servers where that wouldn&#39;t have happened.  On Innorruuk, we<br/>
would have been way out of line to try it.  Yeah, there are times when two guilds show up for the same<br/>
MOB, and it stinks to be the one that doesn&#39;t get the shot, but for the most part things run pretty darn<br/>
well.<br/>

&gt; Silent Justice got him Thursday afternoon-ish right before the server went<br/>
&gt; down.  Heard that 2 staves dropped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Pantheon (us ;) got him Thursday night right after the servers came back<br/>
&gt; up. Druid drawers & Pally pants - Grats Tiana & Atreides.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Inny is now pretty crowded again at the mid 50 level - damn waiting lists<br/>
&gt; for the big names and races to rare spawns.  Ok, well not exactly waiting<br/>
&gt; lists but lots of folks able to do the &lt; VP &#39;biggies.&#39;  And the damn<br/>
&gt; scheduling for the planes and the quest loot there is making for some<br/>
&gt; strange alliance - uber-guilds who never helped others are now begging for<br/>
&gt; slots in  small guild&#39;s plane runs just for the chance to get quest loots.<br/>
&gt; Strange days indeed.<br/>

&gt; We managed to kill VS last night (for the first time as a guild), despite<br/>
&gt; the bouncing HP problem.<br/>
&gt; Although it really ticked off the Clerics.  He dropped Bard pants!  (I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get them, but I moved up to<br/>
&gt; first in line.)<br/>
