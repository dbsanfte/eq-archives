<div id="ygrps-yiv-815652953"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;By the time I reach 50th level Verant will have upped the level limit to <br/>
&gt;about 250...  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh heh, couldn&#39;t agree more.  I&#39;ve been playing since April 1st and still<br/>
am at 16th level, okay I was 17th level very briefly, but I &#39;waste&#39; so much<br/>
time doing quests and running around interacting and generally exploring<br/>
that I level ridiculously slowly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However I do agree that something must be done about <br/>
&gt;harvesting low level mobs for twinkie treasure by high level characters. <br/>
&gt;My suggestion:  random spawn points for the named NPC&#39;s that carry the good<br/>
<br/>
&gt;stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this suggestion, but I still think it would be better to have a<br/>
creature always spawn with its common drop and a timestamp.  Every game day<br/>
(or whatever period is appropriate for that creature) the timestamp is<br/>
checked, and if a sufficient amount of time has passed since the creature<br/>
spawned, his common drop is replaced with his rare drop.  I would think this<br/>
would help discourage camping as killing the spawn without the rare drop<br/>
would further delay the appearance of the rare drop.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the idea of comparing a critters time of death to his spawn<br/>
timestamp and if less than some set amount respawning him at a higher level<br/>
until he reaches his max level.  If this max level was increased, imagine<br/>
the camper&#39;s surprise as they battle the critter for the 5th time and<br/>
suddenly get pasted by a critter they had little trouble with before.<br/>
