<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851437336">It is rumored it will eventually be located in Kedge Keep. At the moment however<br/>
it has only been given out during GM run dynamic quests. As such there are VERY<br/>
few in existence at the moment.<br/>

&gt; I have heared a lot of people talk about the sword of Ykesha and the<br/>
&gt; Wakizashi (sp:) as being two of the best weapons that a bard can use.  Well<br/>
&gt; I was wondering about the Fanged Skull Stiletto which is DAM 12 Delay 22<br/>
&gt; piercing and usable by Bards.  It is apparently not a lore item so you could<br/>
&gt; in theory get two of these and be a virtual quisinart.  Does anyone own one?<br/>
&gt; Know how to get one?  I have heard that they come from somewhere in Dagnour<br/>
&gt; Cauldron.  Perhaps this item is so hard to get that it is not realistic to<br/>
&gt; obtain untill really high levels.  Info please :)<br/>
