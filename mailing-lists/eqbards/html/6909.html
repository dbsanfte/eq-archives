<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938475977">BIG problem with this one...<br/>
<br/>
Most lore stuff that&#39;s around now is NO DROP.  Ooops, have to hold it to get<br/>
the song to work.  Can&#39;t hold it cause someone else has it.  Can&#39;t ID that<br/>
for you, sorry...if you can&#39;t let me handle it, I can&#39;t sing my song on it.<br/>
Oh, well...you should have been a bard.  Since we are the only ones that can<br/>
loot it, then ID it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you can take chances with your valuable item...give it to a decaying<br/>
skellie, and hope I can loot it.  Then rinse and repeat. Oh, this doesn&#39;t<br/>
work anymore?<br/>
Nah, drop it on the ground. NO, not in a bag!  Sorry...it&#39;s gone...<br/>
Oh, okay, you dropped it on the multi-colored ground.  Hey, does anyone see<br/>
a...oh, that newbie grabbed it and ran...sorry...<br/>
Let me kill you in a duel.  Then I can loot...oops no...can&#39;t loot a NO<br/>
DROP.<br/>
Lessee...I think that&#39;s all the transfer methods I know of...<br/>

&gt;Great news.  I have never even purchased the 14th level song.  I just wrote<br/>
&gt;it off as useless.  I will have to purchase it and try it out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe that since this song now has at lease some effect, that they<br/>
&gt;probably wont even consider replacing it.  If they were to start adding<br/>

&gt;     Gentle Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I agree with your idea in theory but not on your choice of song to<br/>
&gt;     replace.  Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that<br/>
&gt;     had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my<br/>
&gt;     surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item<br/>
&gt;     that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the<br/>
&gt;     song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I<br/>
&gt;     finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will<br/>
&gt;     finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is still not a real<br/>
&gt;     heavyweight but it actually works now and more importantly Verant is<br/>
&gt;     actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.<br/>
&gt;     Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     your suggestions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I<br/>
&gt;     certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     5.  see 3 above<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts like the ranger<br/>
&gt;     track skill.<br/>

&gt;I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the<br/>
&gt;list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end up getting it<br/>
&gt;posted twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fellow bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>
&gt;In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>petition<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song<br/>
&gt;currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>
&gt;identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is<br/>
&gt;sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>
&gt;attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>
&gt;the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>
&gt;it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new<br/>
&gt;song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think minor<br/>
&gt;versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new song<br/>
&gt;should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone<br/>
&gt;submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be.<br/>
&gt;Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>
&gt;have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>
&gt;to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;vote on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or toned<br/>
&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>
&gt;amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you sing<br/>
&gt;Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>
&gt;instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>
&gt;song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>
&gt;Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>
&gt;level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you<br/>
&gt;can try it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>
&gt;bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>
&gt;mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>
&gt;someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>
&gt;one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>
&gt;thats what everyone wants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these<br/>
&gt;that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday for<br/>
&gt;the next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive response,<br/>
&gt;someone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;will write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an<br/>
&gt;agreement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
