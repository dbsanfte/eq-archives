big.  It adds 20% to other percussion effects (e.g. Elemental<br/>
Rhythms which used to give you +30 to resists now gives you<br/>
+36).  But for speed it is only about 15% greater speedup than<br/>
a normal hand drum when running unencumbered (for a total of<br/>
an extra 7%-8% compared to running at normal speed).  If<br/>
you&#39;re walking (wounded) or encumbered, then the speedup is<br/>
more pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
It sure *feels* a lot faster though. :-)<br/>
