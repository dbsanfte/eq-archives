<b>Subject:</b> Chains resists <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085478126">yes i know this come up after every patch, no i haven&#39;t done any formal<br/>
testing =)  but has anyone noticed an increase in chains resists?  possibly<br/>
from them still tinkering with it?  i can understand the krup frogs and<br/>
higher giving me problems in sebilis, but the sepsis scarabs and the bok<br/>
knights and even lower have been resisting chains an insane amount in the<br/>
last couple days.  i had 2 group members die on 2 different occassions<br/>
because i could not get it to stick, and have been getting 3 to 5 straight<br/>
resists very commonly on bok and even lower in sebilis.  this is why i<br/>
notice.  i have never claimed the &quot;resists are up, the patch nerfed<br/>
something!&quot; problem before.<br/>
<br/>
on another note, i&#39;d love a definitive answer to this question, as it would<br/>
allow me to start chaining sooner if i am the snarer in the group.  i group<br/>
with a shaman a lot, and obviously the shaman is in charge of slowing the<br/>
mob.  so, if the shaman slows the mob, and i chain the mob after, will the<br/>
chain cancel the shaman&#39;s slowdown?  i usually wait til close to when the<br/>
mob is going to run cause i don&#39;t want to cancel the slow.  if i am not<br/>
going to cancel it then i can start snaring earlier, since i have recently<br/>
become accustomed to getting resisted a ton.<br/>
