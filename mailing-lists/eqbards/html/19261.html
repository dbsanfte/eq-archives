<div id="ygrps-yiv-407776897">I&#39;m sure they WOULD fix the problems, if they knew how.<br/>
It is not as easy to fix problems as to say &quot;Fix them&quot;<br/>
You first have to figure out what the problems are.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of the disconnects I have had recently I can trail right back<br/>
to my DSL line. Including last night&#39;s. (We have REALLY poor DSL service.<br/>
But<br/>
US West can&#39;t seem to figure out why our line quality goes so screwy<br/>
so often) I do not have the problem of mobs turning into male humans, and<br/>
have never heard of the boat doing so before.<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t problems affecting every subscriber or, even, a majority.<br/>
And at that point, it does become much more likely there is a problem<br/>
on the individual&#39;s system than in the program itself.<br/>

&gt;Ouch.  I survived all the LD&#39;s, including the last one.  Unfortunately now<br/>
&gt;for all I know I may be standing inside the Giant fort in Warsliks<br/>
&gt;Woods.  I<br/>
&gt;logged back on far enough to see where my character was and whether he was<br/>
&gt;naked or not and then gave up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;None of the suggestions in the banner had any effect on the lockups by the<br/>
&gt;way.  I tried them all.  I wish they would just actually fix the problems<br/>
&gt;instead of always saying reinstall Directx 7.0a.  I have a friend who has<br/>
&gt;been plagued with mobs turning into male humans, including the boat!  You<br/>
&gt;can not ride a boat that is a male human btw.  She is also plagued with<br/>
&gt;occasional crashes that force a hard reboot as well.  Every call to tech<br/>
&gt;support has received the same mantric response.  &quot;Delete you character .opt<br/>
&gt;files.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Reinstall Directx 7.0a.  Reinstall your video drivers.&quot;  None of these has<br/>
&gt;had any effect.  Ever.  She even reformatted her hard drive and reinstalled<br/>
&gt;everything from scratch, no change.  For the past three months camping a<br/>
&gt;character causes a crash of EQ to the desktop 75% of time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I too experienced these same problems in the same zone, Kit (btw, nice<br/>
&gt;chatting with you last night).  I&#39;ve only gone LD a total of 3 times before<br/>
&gt;in the last year of playing.  Last night I went LD twice.  The last time I<br/>
&gt;went LD, I ended up dying.  It was at this point that I gave up for the<br/>
&gt;night.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Patch effects (OT)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was the stated reason for the patch, but I found that either it had<br/>
&gt;quite the opposite effect, or by coincidence there were far more connection<br/>
&gt;problems last nite than I have ever seen in 14+ months of play.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;been disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>
&gt;modem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.<br/>
&gt; On about<br/>
&gt;half those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>
&gt;disconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
&gt;showed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>
&gt;seen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>
&gt;at work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>
&gt;sources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>
&gt;game was totally unplayable last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Kit<br/>
&gt;      Somewhere in Warsliks Woods, only wish I knew where<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The servers were down for an emergency patch today.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that<br/>
&gt;were causing<br/>
&gt;people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first<br/>
&gt;time in four<br/>
&gt;months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
&gt;before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>
