 </span></blockquote>Hmm. None of the L50+ enchanters in our guild seem to have this problem.<br/>
The other night camping a Veeshan&#39;s key piece in Karnor&#39;s sewers our<br/>
enchanter was keeping 6+ mobs under control pretty well continuously<br/>
most of the night, thanks to the lovely bugs down there. Just when we&#39;d<br/>
work down to the last couple of mobs, another couple would drop through<br/>
the ceiling on us to add to the fun. If it wasn&#39;t for clarity 2 and the<br/>
bard playing cantata non-stop we probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to<br/>
handle it for as long as we did, but it was great, intense fun until we<br/>
finally got an 11+ pull and had to evac.<br/>
<br/>
If a bard could even keep 3 mezzed it would at least make grouping at<br/>
50+ a bit more fun than having to sit around until an enchanter logged<br/>
on to go to Sebilis or HS. Once you pass 55 even pickup groups in<br/>
Karnors stop being an option as the front mobs turn mostly green.<br/>
