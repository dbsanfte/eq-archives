steel plate), I get the impression that mobs get an attack<br/>
bonus if you are close to encumbered but not there yet.  I am<br/>
regularly being hit for close to max damage, while my lower<br/>
level friends in banded seem to be taking less.  The only one<br/>
who seems to take more is my monk friend, who is 6 levels<br/>
behind me and has woven/mesh (leather/chain equivalent for<br/>
damage absorbtion).<br/>

&gt; she is convinced that other rogues complain so much because most probably<br/>
&gt; are under the impression that strength is the ONE statistic, others<br/>
&gt; meaningless.  She is always avoiding blows, and wears many items to increase<br/>
&gt; her agility.  (O and how she loves backstabbing and my ability to taunt with<br/>
&gt; a lullaby)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My agility is 99, 117 when my ranger friend casts feet like<br/>
cat on me.  I can&#39;t say if I&#39;m that much better at avoiding<br/>
blows - if there is a difference it is subtle.  The monk list<br/>
speculates that the amount of weight you&#39;re carrying ties in<br/>
to your chance to dodge, even if you&#39;re not encumbered.  I<br/>
have not seen myself dodge in quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll try borrowing my monk friend&#39;s backup mesh armor<br/>
for a night and see how it goes compared to plate.<br/>
