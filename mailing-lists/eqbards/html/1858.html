<div id="ygrps-yiv-393934545">Hello again!<br/>
<br/>
This is one of my pet issues, so I&#39;m going to discuss this a bit more. *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Mostly OOC here too, so my apologies...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know that EQ is different from the text-based muds we all want to<br/>
&gt;emulate, and I&#39;m incredibly excited about the visual aspect to gaming - but<br/>
&gt;until voice-com becomes standard (*grin* one, maybe two years?), typing is<br/>
&gt;a significant hassle.  I personally have a repetoire of nearly a hundred<br/>
&gt;songs - but typing just a set (4-6 songs) would leave my hands so cramped I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t type for a week after that.  Call me selfish - but I&#39;d like a<br/>
&gt;shortcut :P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the real cramping comes from doing the shift-chrarcters when typing.<br/>
The /em sings, &#39; gets really old. Back in P3 when I started this, I didn&#39;t<br/>
use a &#39;sing&#39; emote for just this reason. I&#39;m a pretty fast typist<br/>
(80-90wpm) and I discovered that by just using say to do the lyrics, I<br/>
could type at about reading speed for most people. People seemed to keep<br/>
interest in the ballads pretty well, and everything was nice. <br/>
<br/>
Then, when the Soerbaird evolved, and we started seeing each other perform<br/>
every night or every other night in some cases, we traded a lot of tips.<br/>
The emotes are VERY effective in making the text really liven up, so I<br/>
picked that up. Effective, but harder and slowed me down. That&#39;s why I&#39;d<br/>
like a configuable emote mode.<br/>
<br/>
But still, I&#39;m going to go with manual text entry. Again, its hard, yes.<br/>
But it goes a long way to making the performance seem more real. There&#39;s a<br/>
chance you can mess up, there&#39;s a chance you can be cut off, there&#39;s a<br/>
chance you&#39;ll skip a line word or verse. All just like real performance. I<br/>
love this aspect of barding in Norrath, and wouldn&#39;t want to change it, really.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Most typists who play (if they&#39;re lucky) type from 40-60 wpm.  This can<br/>
&gt;make the average 3 minute song last about... 10 minutes.  I&#39;d hate to see a<br/>
&gt;Bardic with only 10 people under those conditions (I&#39;m used to 30+<br/>
&gt;competitors, using scripts, and the competition lasts upwards of 3 hours.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if you&#39;re using scripts, why bother doing it in the game? Make a nice<br/>
in-character web site, and compete there. It would be much easier to read<br/>
and understand there? I mean, if you&#39;re using a script, again, you&#39;re not<br/>
really performing. It&#39;s not live! It&#39;s memorex! The few times I&#39;ve seen<br/>
bards use macros to do their songs, I&#39;ve found myself tuning it out. I<br/>
guess its a spam-reflex, but it just seems cheaper if its automated.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, in a one-hour concert (typical for the major Soerbaird<br/>
concerts) we have six or eight bards perform, with songs ranging from five<br/>
minutes to fifteen or more. Now I used to wonder about a fifteen minute<br/>
song, but you have to remember, barding is not pop-radio. Our &#39;songs&#39; are<br/>
in fact stories set to verse, and often ballads are much longer than<br/>
traditional songs. In that light, it&#39;s ok for them to be long, just as long<br/>
as they&#39;re interesting.<br/>
A well-written one can easily go fifteen to twenty minutes when performed<br/>
and not lose the audience. (I have a forty-five minute one that I ended up<br/>
chopping up into sub-stories, because it did get a bit old there. Hehe.)<br/>
<br/>
Roop....as far as plays go, members of the Soerbaird have already generated<br/>
two plays, both of some quality. You&#39;ll probably see one performed before<br/>
long at all. I&#39;ve not seen this done yet, but I think it could be effective<br/>
if you had the right visual and prop elements.<br/>
<br/>
Good discussion all! I really hope to see some of you perform around<br/>
Norrath! If this kind of thing REALLY appeals to you, then I&#39;d encourage<br/>
you to take a look at The Soerbaird, because this is EXACTLY what I founded<br/>
the guild to do. To use the role of the bard in a bardic in-character<br/>
fashion to help breathe life into what can sometimes seem a bland, and<br/>
fruitless world.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live.<br/>
