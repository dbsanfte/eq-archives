<div id="ygrps-yiv-571079179">Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I seem to remember in your last post you are <br/>
thinking of quitting over this? Honestly, it&#39;s a fact of life. It&#39;s going to <br/>
happen in every MMORPG that doesn&#39;t have strict level limits on eqipment <br/>
(i.e., &quot;You must be level 30 to equip this item!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Just deal.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Rather than let it bum you out, why not see that anyone who would laugh<br/>
&gt; &gt; at you for not being 50 yet should be pitied. While I sympathize with<br/>
&gt; &gt; your plight however, I also think that this really stems from a bit of<br/>
&gt; &gt; jealousy, I also think learning to deal with that can be valuable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>
&gt;disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not jealousy.  I<br/>
&gt;am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and that I do <br/>
&gt;not,<br/>
&gt;nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>
&gt;Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some lower) <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>
&gt;feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>
&gt;discouragement at the diminishment of my questing accomplishments because <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>
&gt;steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>
&gt;made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>
&gt;yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>
&gt;instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As I said in <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>
&gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>
&gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>
&gt;DROP.<br/>
