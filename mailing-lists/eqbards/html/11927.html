random death touches are probably one of the cheeziest cop out design<br/>
decisions ever made? It reminds me of something a 12 year old playing DM<br/>
in D&D for the first time would come up with, not something you&#39;d expect<br/>
from a professional game designer. That and relying on obvious<br/>
programming flaws like zone in delay and through wall and ceiling agro<br/>
for their difficulty are probably the things that annoy me most about<br/>
this game.<br/>
