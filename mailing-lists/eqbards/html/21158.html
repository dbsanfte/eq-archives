I&#39;ve been awy from Norrath for a while (damn NetWare certifications!),<br/>
and am 744 unread messages behind<br/>
in RL &lt;sigh&gt;, and am STILL at level 12, but hopefully I&#39;ll be drumming &<br/>
strumming my way through whatever<br/>
zone it was I last camped out in (wisp isle?) soon enough.<br/>
