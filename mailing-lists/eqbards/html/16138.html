We had tried pulling Dojorn to the 3rd isle with no luck as well (back in<br/>
the levitating days of Air).  Now we take him on on his own isle.  One of<br/>
the Paladin&#39;s in our guild has found a way to trick the two Bladestorms into<br/>
leaving the island so we are able to fight Dojorn solo.  I will try to<br/>
observe his techinique next time he go up there.  The full loot list from<br/>
Dojorn last night was a Warrior haste belt, Golden Efreeti Bow (ranger quest<br/>
item), and Golden Efreeti Greeves.   On our first Dojorn kill we got 4 items<br/>
but 3 rotted due to confusion in the post-kill rezing order.  This time we<br/>
did pre-lotto rolls per class for whatever dropped, saved alot of trouble in<br/>
that precious 8 mins post-kill time.<br/>
<br/>
Also Dojorn is pretty much immune to magic.  So it is melee, melee, melee.<br/>
Our group got waxed as BOTH our healers went LD as soon as the battle<br/>
started :(  We had about 45 people there I believe.<br/>
