&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have like 1600+ items in my bard email folder and keep going there<br/>
&gt; thinking that I will delete them.  But each time I find some &#39;gem&#39; and<br/>
&gt; decide to just keep them for a while longer.  Here is a clip that might<br/>
&gt; amuse some of you:<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] high level bard suggestion<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can&#39;t stop thinking about weak bards at high levels, haunted with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; premonition of myself sitting in the entrance of some dungeon,<br/>
&gt; periodically<br/>
&gt; &gt; calling out I need to join a group, no answer, finally logging out after<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; long night without having done a thing.  Had an idea, though, tell me<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; you think.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I think you&#39;ll find that at higher levels, the players DO appreciate a<br/>
&gt; bard,<br/>
&gt; and actively seek them out, if there&#39;s not a regular one in their cadre.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; By that point, the newbie curse of the bard has worn off, there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; confusion in the upper level players mind about what a bard can do.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And, by default, if you&#39;ve taken a bard to the 40&#39;s and beyond, you have<br/>
&gt; &quot;proven&quot; yourself to be skilled in bardic ways and a good social animal as<br/>
&gt; well.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Not to mention that not only do you have an active support role, you have<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; active combat role as well, and neither requires you to sit on your duff<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; 10 minutes after each fight, staring at a spell book.  And, when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; along, of course, you minimize that for others as well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; As far as boosting bardic power, it&#39;s already done.  At 45th level, (or<br/>
&gt; pretty much any level after you get Hymn, for that matter) you DO see the<br/>
&gt; health bar move at an appreciable rate, as well as the mana bar, when a<br/>
&gt; bard<br/>
&gt; is along.  A single bard in a group of 6 can flat outheal a cleric over<br/>
&gt; time, doing around 1200 hp per minute per person in the party. The<br/>
&gt; offensive<br/>
&gt; powers of a bard are subtle, but still very potent.  DDD was added to give<br/>
&gt; them a bit more rapid firepower in limited situations, for there are times<br/>
&gt; when nuking is handy.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Anyone who thinks a high level bard is weak has a serious perception or<br/>
&gt; education problem.  There&#39;s been an ongoing debate internally for months<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; about bards being, if anything, too powerful, and nobody internal, even<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; staunchest bard advocates, have ever claimed they were weak, not since<br/>
&gt; phase<br/>
&gt; 2 (before that point, many classes, including the bard, were in a much<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; unfinished state).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Personally, I think one of the defining moments for a bard is when they<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; themselves no longer memorizing Bellow, even when solo.  I won&#39;t expound<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; that, when that time comes, you will know.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, fear not, unless you&#39;ve done something of a personal nature to make<br/>
&gt; others hesitant to group with you, you&#39;ll not lack appreciation for what<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; bring to the table.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; (end paste)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the first poster<br/>
&gt; turned<br/>
&gt; out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy who answered<br/>
&gt; him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him has since shed<br/>
&gt; his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I really like the<br/>
&gt; part about bards being able to heal more than clerics &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>
&gt; does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be fair - he may<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and with only &quot;old<br/>
&gt; world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the current use of a<br/>
&gt; main<br/>
&gt; tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>
