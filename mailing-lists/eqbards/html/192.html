&gt; Can someone please explain how to play two songs at once?  Whenever I switch<br/>
&gt; songs the other one ends.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you stop playing a song, at least one of the songs that is not pulse based<br/>
like Hymn of Restoration or Chords of Dissonance, the effect does not wear off<br/>
immediately.  To verify this for yourself, start running with Selo&#39;s<br/>
Accelerando, then stop singing. Note the delay before you slow down.<br/>
<br/>
To play two songs at once, or even three (which I call juggling), start a song,<br/>
wait for the effect to kick in (look for the words describing the song or for<br/>
the effect icon to appear), then stop the song and start another one.  By<br/>
skillfully starting and stopping your songs, you can have more than one &quot;active&quot;<br/>
at a time.<br/>
