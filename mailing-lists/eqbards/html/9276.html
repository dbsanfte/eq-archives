<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121277252">Ok, yes HighKeep can be great xp but it really depends on your group.  Too<br/>
many higher levs will sponge your xp.  I been in there many hour from 19<br/>
thru 32 (and 31 and 32 were just despiration camps for xp.) If you have a<br/>
choice between being the top dog in the warrior room or low man on totem<br/>
pole in Raider room - I&#39;d choose warrior room - more fite and bigger shares<br/>
of xp.<br/>
<br/>
The best ever xp I got in HK was when I was 22ish and camped the ramp with a<br/>
30ish cleric - just me and him.  We discovered kinda by accident that we<br/>
could kill the warrior spawns.  I got a bub of xp in about 6 kills but never<br/>
had the chance to do that again.  At 30ish, I have spent an hour in HK and<br/>
barely see my bub moving - depends on if there are upper levs in my group -<br/>
if there are - xp is sponged up by them.<br/>
<br/>
If you find your self &quot;stuck&quot;, here are a couple more things to do:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Go to South karana and get a party together to camp the top floor of<br/>
the main aviak tree.  You should be able to muster enough hp from a party to<br/>
hold that room easily.  There are 5 spawns: 3 perches in the room, the ledge<br/>
spawn and the Krak buddy spawn (he pulls ez and Krak ignores the fight.)<br/>
Much to your delight - you should see 3 avo spawns at times.  You can charm<br/>
and fight or mez and fight or Melifious Motion and evac.  A side bene of<br/>
avo&#39;s is the chram they drop and the quest for crafted gauntlets.  Assuming<br/>
your have the plat to spare, you can &quot;buy&quot; quarter bubs of hp each time you<br/>
do the quest.  You got higher up caster pals?  They should be happy to buy a<br/>
mana pump &lt;g&gt;  If you don&#39;t like doing the quest, you can kill Sharkn the<br/>
quest giver for xp.  Not sure what faction hits you take if any and it tends<br/>
to piss off those who do the quest but the respawn time is pretty short. So<br/>
the questers can do their thing and you can kill him again.  At 32ish, he<br/>
was a blue con and I saw a druid who should have had better things to do<br/>
killing Sharkn until he was nearly 40.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Goto Unrest if you have a good group or can get in a good group.<br/>
Camp the basement torture chamber (first big basement room) 4 spawns in the<br/>
room easy to hold at your level and great steady supply of blues.  Beware of<br/>
Ghost Room trains - be ready to evac and come back.<br/>
<br/>
By 30, I saw the end of my days in HK.  I know some stay til 35 but sheesh<br/>
it&#39;s a waste of time when there are still other good places and stuff you<br/>
need to be learning.  Like around 30 and even before - mid to hi 20&#39;s, I<br/>
think you should be learning upper guk. In lo to mid 30&#39;s you will be<br/>
travelling thru upper guk pretty often, so it will be worth your time to<br/>
learn it - I am still lost and depend on my group to lead me thru and feel<br/>
like an idjit.  Same thing for Sol-A.  Time to learn how to get there and<br/>
back and maybe do some small excursions in Sol-A.  You should get good XP<br/>
there - just need to be careful that you can evac to a zone.  The zone<br/>
huggers in these higher zones face the trains of the higher lev mobs and<br/>
they can hurt ya bad.<br/>
<br/>
In my book, HK is the place to be from 20ish thru 30 - mixed with liberal<br/>
doses of South Karana, Upper Guk, Sol-A (carefully).<br/>

		At the insistence of my higher-level friends, who want me to<br/>
get Level 32 as fast <br/>
		as possible, I&#39;ve been hanging around High Keep for several<br/>
levels now. <br/>
<br/>
		[snips]<br/>
<br/>
		I would estimate that you can pick up a bubble of exp once<br/>
every two to three <br/>
		hours, depending on the group you&#39;re in (level 30 excepted).<br/>

		PS - Be sure to say &quot;Hi&quot; to me if you come by.  I expect to<br/>
be there until lvl 32, <br/>
		then I get dragged off by my level 40 caster buddies.<br/>
