&gt; And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
&gt; dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>
&gt; hear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>
&gt; intended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>
&gt; soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>
&gt; changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>
&gt; the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested in why you think &quot;The Bard was never intended to be a<br/>
grunt-class.&quot;  Why do you say that?  We can use all the &quot;grunt&quot; weapons except<br/>
the big two handers.  We have strength as a major attribute, just like the<br/>
grunts.  How are we not a &quot;big burly type&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m just one of the &quot;battle bards&quot; getting all wound up here, but I<br/>
really don&#39;t understand why people think we shouldn&#39;t have plate just because<br/>
Alan A-Dale in Robin hood didn&#39;t :)   There&#39;s a specific set of advantages and<br/>
disadvantages we have, and clearly plate is meant to be one of the advantages.<br/>
Bards don&#39;t get double attack, kick or archery, but we get dual wield and<br/>
plate.  Rangers don&#39;t get plate, but they get double attack, archery and<br/>
kick.   And so on and so on.<br/>
