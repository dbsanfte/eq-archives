<div id="ygrps-yiv-953533687"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We also took down CT this weekend on E&#39;ci, first time Fear had successfully<br/>
&gt; been broken since it was &quot;enhanced&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Good job.  Those upgraded HT&#39;s hurt bad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I unfortunately passed out shortly<br/>
&gt; after the Dracoliche fight around 4am Sunday morning, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Wow... same thing with me.  I didnt get to see Draco fall, cause<br/>
  I was so tired.  But I did nap and come back for CT.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So about 50 hours of fear-fighting for 1 friggin piece of carmine armor,<br/>
&gt; and I didn&#39;t even get it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think a few carmine pieces dropped.  I know at aleast one did for<br/>
  sure.  We had to let a lot of warrior Amyg loot rot, along with necro<br/>
  armor.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Hate to let stuff rot.<br/>
<br/>
  Got monk arms, cleric belts, shaman belts, ranger legs, druid legs,<br/>
  war gloves, fluxblade, etc.  The list goes on, but still the loot <br/>
  was very weak.  In 48 hours, and many mobs killed, I&#39;d say only <br/>
  20 things dropped.  5 of which rotted, I&#39;d guess.<br/>
<br/>
  Ah well.  I hate Verant, but you didn&#39;t hear that from me.<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
