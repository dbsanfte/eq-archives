<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840317318">Some brain dead Bard twink on the Mithaniel Marr server Was selling Lambent<br/>
gauntlets today. was taking offers. I offered her 250 for them. she said she<br/>
was only taking serious offers over 2k.<br/>
Please please please.. no one, no matter how much money you have to burn,<br/>
buy ANY lambent for that price. they are not THAT hard to get.<br/>
