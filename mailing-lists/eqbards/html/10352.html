&gt; I don&#39;t dispute that.  I was just wanted to make it clear that<br/>

&gt; Once you understand that, you start to see that monster<br/>
&gt; boosting is just another step in the downward spiral the mud<br/>
&gt; wimping article describes.  Slowly advancing people<br/>
&gt; get screwed while the quickly advancing people the changes are<br/>
&gt; aimed at are relatively unaffected since they&#39;re already high<br/>
&gt; level.  *That* is what frustrates me most about this whole<br/>
&gt; process - it&#39;s regressive in that the lowest levels are nerfed<br/>
&gt; the most.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What it really boils down to is lack of room for both parties (advanced vs<br/>
lower lvl). After experiencing the kind of openess that Asherons Call<br/>
allows, Everquest is really starting to feel like an apartment with 3<br/>
families living in it. The Kithicor change is a classic example of this.<br/>
They took a well used travel corridor and turned it into a death trap so<br/>
that high level players wouldn&#39;t have to fight 90 other people for a spot in<br/>
lower guk. The problem is that since travel is so restrictive (through zone<br/>
points) that the younger players don&#39;t have much alternative.<br/>
Everquest simply cannot expand fast enough to support the players. A new<br/>
continent in March? Oh joy.....we need it now. For the average high level<br/>
player (between lvl 40-50) you can count on one hand the number of zones<br/>
that are desirable to go to, and in all of those zones, you are gonna find a<br/>
large number of players already there.<br/>
Monster boosting would be a better choice than player nerfing, but it<br/>
requires more new places to go where the new creatures could be added in,<br/>
leaving the lower level creatures in tact for the newer players.<br/>
Unfortunately Verant has already proven to us that this will never happen.<br/>
They simply do not have the capability to add on new zones quickly. Since<br/>
retail release (and correct me if I&#39;m wrong) a grand whopping total of 3<br/>
zones have been added, two of which are only for extremely high level<br/>
players, and the other is just for quests. 3 zones have been completely<br/>
revamped (Kith and Kedge and Perma), but again, revamping takes away from<br/>
the younger players and gives to the higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
EQ is stagnating because it isn&#39;t growing. Stagnation is slow death.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.......here is hoping that the next crop of MMRPG&#39;s (Heroes Journey<br/>
and Shadowbane) allow for the easy expansion of the world by the game<br/>
designers. Then maybe these problems would have a chance of being solved.<br/>
