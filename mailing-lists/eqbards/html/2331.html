<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437063959">I found that critters resist Pixie Strike a lot less than the charm song.  <br/>
Also for Pixie song, you don&#39;t have to wait until the effect wear out before <br/>
you cast another one.  So you could be standing there and sing it over and <br/>
over again.  I can hold a blue critter in place indefinately without taking <br/>
any damage.  For charm song, you have to wait until the charm wears off and <br/>
if you time it right, you maybe able to recharm it before it throws the <br/>
first punch at you.  It requires really good timing and hope that the <br/>
critter does not resist your charm.<br/>
<br/>
Also for the charm song, once it was charm, it will FIX on you when he wakes <br/>
up.  Almost nothing can pull him off you.  As for pixie, it doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
care who put it to sleep, when it wakes up, it just attacks whoever was <br/>
hitting it or whoever he was hitting when he was put to sleep.<br/>

&gt;Now Pixie Strike (formerly pixie chase) might work for that. It seems to<br/>
&gt;be sort of a targetted lullaby, but the few times I&#39;ve used it I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;noticed if it cleared the hate list, in fact it didn&#39;t seem to be all<br/>
&gt;that useful at all. The few times it worked it kept one mob standing<br/>
&gt;around for about 10 seconds. If that&#39;s all it does, I dont see why you&#39;d<br/>
&gt;use it instead of charm, which basically does the same thing with the<br/>
&gt;added bonus that you can have the mob attack it&#39;s friends for those 10<br/>
&gt;seconds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone found some use for Pixie Strike I may have missed?<br/>
