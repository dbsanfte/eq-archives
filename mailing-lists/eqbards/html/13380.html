&gt; &gt; I stay up every night too late... last night was to build up some extra <br/>
&gt; &gt; level 50 xp because I am fearing the new plane will be a deathfest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Yeah, I hear that.  I experience the same thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Eastern Time,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   6:00pm : Home from work, get the women on the cooking, I fire up eq.<br/>
&gt;            Harmonic lets you all know he was ..ugh I cant do it, caps..<br/>
&gt;            just kidding!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   6:15pm : Ooops, the login server is F&#39;d up once again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   6:30pm : What is all this lag?  Christ...  doh, 2,000 people on<br/>
&gt;            each server, go Verant!  Way to keep up with demand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   7:00pm : Camped in hateplane, now bumming for a group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   7:05pm - 11:00pm : /shout more scorn banshees damnit, what is this<br/>
&gt;                      their night off or something?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   11:15pm : Weather comes on the news, girlfriend starts chanting,<br/>
&gt;             &#39;camp camp camp camp&#39;  One more pull hon, and I&#39;ll come<br/>
&gt;             to bed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    4:00am : Got to work in 4 hours, ugh.  No armor drops, one more<br/>
&gt;             pull... one more scorn banshee... please... falling asleep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    That is how my nights are going recently.  Although I did finally<br/>
&gt;    get a Six note blade.  Five bards in the hateplane, yikes.  Lots<br/>
&gt;    of competition.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;    Harm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Harmonic, I feel affinity to you now.  I am _scared_ (Mara refrains from caps due<br/>
to this newfound camaraderie).<br/>
And the agreement around my place is: no complaining!  I did it to myself!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I really lucked out on an imbrued bracer drop from a cube in Fear the other<br/>
night.  I get these frantic tells from my group:  &quot;Quick!  Get ressed and loot this<br/>
bracer before it poofs!&quot;.  LOL like I had any control. <br/>
Seriously, the lead monk went above and beyond (thanks Shishio) to drag me back to<br/>
be ressed with two Amy warriors on him.<br/>
<br/>
Topic switch:<br/>
Here&#39;s a suggestion for a new song:  Denon&#39;s Disco Inferno.  Makes everyone in your<br/>
party dance as long as you play it.  Or....makes the mobs dance and stop attacking<br/>
you.  Kind of like Lullaby but much funnier animation.<br/>
