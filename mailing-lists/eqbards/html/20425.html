<div id="ygrps-yiv-456328231"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I <br/>
&gt; first got that song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
&gt; all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; leveled, it&#39;s become more useful.  I really<br/>
&gt; only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good <br/>
&gt; success rate (knock on wood).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am currently using this a LOT in Kern&#39;s tower. I have yet to have it fail<br/>
on a white or *crosses fingers, throws salt over shoulder and sticks a black<br/>
cat bone in shoe* yellows.<br/>
<br/>
It allows me to hunt solo there very handily, *this* song at least the bum<br/>
got right.<br/>
