<div id="ygrps-yiv-220551582">I guess we need to agree to disagree here &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My number one system is 3 chants off the naggy drum.  Somethings have built<br/>
in resistance and I will switch to weapons when I encouter these.  But they<br/>
are not all that common.  Stuff that resists the song because of level<br/>
difference will also resist damage when you melee: Sylly hits a red mob_00<br/>
for 8 points of damage!  Woo heee, 4 thousand more hits like that and this<br/>
guy is toast!<br/>
<br/>
When I am in hard places, its with the &quot;perfect group&quot; and we have clerics<br/>
and enchanters.  I dont need to haste folks or heal folks.  Unless it&#39;s a<br/>
God or Dragon, I am not doing the heavy duty resists either.  In my mana<br/>
song weave, I add Nillipus.  Why?  Selos Drums adds 35 AC to them.  If they<br/>
have that for for even just the opening rounds of combat, it should be<br/>
helping them.  If a series of mobs has inately high resists (usually a<br/>
native fire or cold resist) I swap to a weave with Nillipus instead of the<br/>
resisted chant.<br/>
<br/>
When I am in &#39;easy places&#39;, it&#39;s been me and a &quot;rooter&quot; and he roots and I<br/>
bard dot-nuke.  I like to stand off and watch the mobs health bar&#39;s dwindle.<br/>
Some ppl like to swing weapons - fine.  Some ppl need to see numbers - fine.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I can contribute significant damage from a distance<br/>
(albeit without the visual satisfaction of seeing weps swing and hits for 12<br/>
points of damage scroll by) without adding to an already busy cleric&#39;s<br/>
worrys.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that there may be more than one way to be &quot;the most effective bard.&quot;<br/>
Circumstances will vary depending on what weps and what magic instruments<br/>
you have, who is in your group, where you are hunting, and what mobs you are<br/>
fighting.  Sometimes song only are better for damage, sometimes it better to<br/>
leave the direct damage to others and to keep the group alive with buffs and<br/>
resists, sometimes it&#39;s better to swing weps and join the melee.  I dont<br/>
really see that there is &quot;one way&quot; to be &quot;the most effective...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; if you want to do damage as a bard at high levels, as opposed<br/>
&gt; to group buffing, you are going to be using weapons.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i am not singing damage songs, i am helping my group.  i am giving them<br/>
&gt; haste, mana, charming, resists, etc. in every fight.  do songs outdamage<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; weapons?  yes.  can you use them to be the most effective bard?  no. </span></blockquote></div>
