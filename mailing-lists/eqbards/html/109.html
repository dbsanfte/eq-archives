<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-171907184">Now interestingly enough I don&#39;t perse have a problem with the 10plat<br/>
charge.  Or rather I would not had I even known about the Soerbard<br/>
before I made level 9 (laugh).  My &quot;problem&quot; &quot;issue&quot; what have you.<br/>
and I want to stress that this isn&#39;t disparaging of them at all is<br/>
what servers are they on?  The Academy page states that there should<br/>
be a patron. How can one have a patron if there are no others on <br/>
their server?  My second problem comes from the agnostic &quot;requirement&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My Bard  Adon is a devout believer and follower of Veeshan believing<br/>
fully that it is by her will his voice holds power.  However being<br/>
that he follows the Dragon Goddess he has no preference among the<br/>
player races, classes, or alignments.  As happy to travel with Troll<br/>
excepting for the smell, as with High-elven Paladin.  I think the<br/>
Soerbard should possibly consider that new potential members may have<br/>
developed chars already, and that benefits for higherlevel joiners should<br/>
also be considered, after all 10 plat is a hefty sum even as a test of loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are just my thoughts and by no means to be considered as ill will<br/>
to the Soerbard who I find a most admirable bard guild at least in intent<br/>
if not function (since I&#39;ve never seen any of you on povar my home)<br/>
