&gt;degenrated the way you desribed it.  I cant imagie doing that job, as I<br/>
&gt;would get very upset.  Fortunatly future Multiplayer games will help<br/>
&gt;with this as they will be &quot;invite only&quot; .  I refer to games like<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I believe there are other options besides limiting the players to your<br/>
friends. If you give people time to engage with the story outside of the<br/>
game it really raises their involvement in whatever /does/ happen. It&#39;s<br/>
easier to suspend disbelief, even in the face of idiot vandals, if you have<br/>
been thinking about the story all day.  If you give people a larger (and<br/>
plausible) meaning to their actions outside of the standard game mechanics<br/>
very little has to &quot;go right&quot; in order for everyone to have fun.<br/>
Framing is everything.  The in-game actions can even be as minimal as<br/>
straight ahead, no frills combat and if you have framed it right people will<br/>
feel as if they have been part of something epic. Which they have, because<br/>
you said so, and you are the &quot;author&quot;, the trick is to make it believable.<br/>
On Rallos Zek, incursions into the Nektulos by Pale Skins were common, but<br/>
one day a 3rd level Paladin showed up who gave all of us a real /reason/ to<br/>
hunt him, he knew how to frame his actions and it made absolutely anything<br/>
happened after that seem, well, important. Heck, before Verant killed Dark<br/>
Unity with faction hits, it was really vibrant, with people really getting<br/>
their emotions tied up with what was essentially a concept completely<br/>
decoupled from game mechanics (then they coupled it, wrongly, and killed<br/>
D.U.)<br/>
Anyway, enough *laughs* yeah, if anyone wonders I have credentials to back<br/>
up my views, buuuuut, it looks like this career thingy of mine has put an<br/>
end to those days. I hope Verant figures it out, there is a lot you could do<br/>
in Norrath.<br/>
