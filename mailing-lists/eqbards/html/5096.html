<div id="ygrps-yiv-510121655"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not doubting that you met with Brad like you said.  What I find hard to believe, perhaps a better term is accept,  is that charisma has no affect on a mob&#39;s chance to resist your song.  Based on what Brad told you, a 20 bard with 85 CHR has the same chance as a 20 bard with 105 CHR to put a 23 level mob to sleep.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps I made the wrong assumption that high charisma indicated you were better at singing and playing your instrument.  If high charisma&#39;s only reduces your chances of missing a note, I&#39;m beginning to wish I hadn&#39;t put any extra starting points into it.  That&#39;s something I could live with.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I wonder if it works the same for enchanters, i.e. no change to mob resists but less chance for spell fizzles?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Now I didn&#39;t say that Charisma had absolutely no effect. One of the main<br/>
&gt; attributes for a bard is charisma and it is rumored, or solidified by now,<br/>
&gt; that charisma provides our mana for the Dirge. It is also said to be<br/>
&gt; important in our chances to successfully sing a song and maybe the duration<br/>
&gt; of effects. What Brad said was that your charisma does not factor in at all<br/>
&gt; in the chance that the MOB will resist some or all of the effect. All I know<br/>
&gt; is that I got a lot more missed notes after donning the ribcage, yet my<br/>
&gt; bellows were still doing max damage almost all of the time.<br/>
&gt;         And you are not believing that Brad knows what he is saying or that I<br/>
&gt; actually talked with him Thursday night? =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Good Journey,<br/>
