<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133078450">You need to go upstairs in Freeport bard guild to find the one guy who<br/>
bothered to learn his Instill Doubt skill well enough to train others. ;p<br/>
<br/>
Then the next time you are in wolf-form, you can annoy your party with ID.<br/>
As a doggy, it triggers the attack animation.  Doubly annoying to anyone who<br/>
has game sounds turned on.<br/>

&gt; I just made 26 and couldn&#39;t train Instil Doubt in Freeport (though it was<br/>
&gt; late I was tired and I think I didn&#39;t check the other guildmaster), no<br/>
&gt; biggie, I need to go to Kelethin to buy Screech anyway. </span></blockquote></div>
