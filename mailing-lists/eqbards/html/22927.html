<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806767957">Simply, to be the ultimate grouping partner.  To enhance tanks in a tank<br/>
heavy group, to tank for casters (a little is better than none, right?<br/>
heh), in a caster heavy group, to control mobs, or heal, or fill whichever<br/>
little niche that was empty in any given group.  To be able to run fast.<br/>
<br/>
Course, now I&#39;ve learned that if a group is &quot;adequate&quot;, they&#39;ll not want to<br/>
add more members (may change, perhaps, now that we know there *is* a<br/>
grouping bonus, and that it will be increased in the near future?).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always been my biggest peeve.  To walk up to a group that isn&#39;t full,<br/>
fighting things that are great xp to me, only to be turned away.  I never<br/>
understand that, if an addition of a group member makes the xp slower, then<br/>
move on to something a little harder, that will give more xp.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then again, I don&#39;t worship the almighty yellow bar, either.  I&#39;m more<br/>
than happy to be in a good group, and just see the &quot;got xp&quot; message after<br/>
every kill...*sigh*, it is just a game, afterall.  What is enjoyable about<br/>
playing &quot;Make the Yellow Bar Bigger!&quot;?  Maybe some people understand.  I<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not spent much time with Atonal lately.  I just don&#39;t have the time to<br/>
dedicate anymore to 60% group hunting, 20% travel, and a measly 20% doing<br/>
what I want...grouped and fighting.  I&#39;d join my guild mates...if the lowest<br/>
didn&#39;t outlevel me by about 15 levels.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 26 now, and yeah, I can fear kite, and in another level charm kite, or<br/>
whatever you wanna call it...but, where solo&#39;ing with a druid is kinda fun,<br/>
solo&#39;ing as a bard is just tedious.  All those group skills, for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Bleh, now I&#39;m rambling, waiting for lunch time to arrive...heh.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When<br/>
I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>
their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>
run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>
been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>
once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
