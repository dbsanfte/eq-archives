&gt; Simple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>
&gt; with 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>
&gt; dungeons).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Every named mob in the dungeon drops a lore, no drop widget (make it<br/>
&gt; approprtiate to the dungeon).  The boss has a lor, no drop container, in<br/>
&gt; which you put the widgets, hit combine, get the reward.  A really clever<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d still end up with people camping the container and<br/>
pulling nearby mobs to get the widgets.  You haven&#39;t really<br/>
discouraged camping, you&#39;ve just made it so pulling other<br/>
nearby mobs (which most campers do anyway) is more important.<br/>
<br/>
I would just get rid of the named mob spawn points.  Have the<br/>
named mob spawn in place of another mob that can appear pretty<br/>
much anywhere in the dungeon.  Then doing a dungeon sweep is<br/>
just as productive as &quot;camping&quot; a spot and pulling stuff to<br/>
kill.  I might even make it so the named mob only spawns on<br/>
top of you *while* you&#39;re fighting one of these other mobs.  <br/>
That way you&#39;re forced to deal with an unplanned situation,<br/>
and there&#39;s no question as to which group the named one<br/>
&quot;belongs&quot; to.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone jumps on this idea because it makes rare items<br/>
too rare, I should point out that the only reason rare items<br/>
and rare spawns are as rare as they are now is because you can<br/>
camp them to force the named mob to spawn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we want it to be, just takes some time.  Also I want to volunteer my<br/>
&gt; time to them to write the bard song creation for EQ2.  I think JKim<br/>
&gt; mentioned it, but I envision a sheet of music paper where you combine<br/>
&gt; notes, accents, rests, tempos, etc... The end result is the song you are<br/>
&gt; singing.  You learn more as you go up levels, plus the ability to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind a bard magic system that&#39;s<br/>
that detailed, but that&#39;s because I have a background in<br/>
music.  Ideally, you want the class to be playable by<br/>
non-musicians - the RP in RPG stands for roleplaying ya know?<br/>
