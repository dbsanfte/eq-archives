You will eventually need all four types of instruments.  Different songs <br/>
use different ones.<br/>
<br/>
For most songs the instrument is optional.  However, I just made 19th level <br/>
last night, and discovered that the instrument is *required* for the mass <br/>
invisibility song.<br/>

Take an hour or two very early in the (real) morning, when not too many <br/>
players are online, and go solo hunting whatever your local variety of <br/>
intelligent weapon-using monster are thick.  Kill ones that are green to <br/>
you, or maybe an occasional blue, but the object here is cash not <br/>
experience so you&#39;re looking for fast easy kills.  If anything gives you <br/>
problems, turn on the boots and run for the zone or guards.<br/>
<br/>
In Kelethin this would be the orc camp area; in Qeynos, Blackburrow.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know the Freeport equivalent.  Anyway, you can make a couple of <br/>
platinum or so per trip depending on your carrying capacity.  We call this <br/>
&quot;rolling Orcs for bus fare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend trying this during the day.  These areas are very <br/>
crowded, so you can&#39;t get much, and also you&#39;d be stealing monsters that <br/>
other players want to kill for experience.  I don&#39;t approve of that.  Also, <br/>
those areas tend to have a lot of trains during crowded times.<br/>
