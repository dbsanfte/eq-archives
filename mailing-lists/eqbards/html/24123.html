<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679086777">I&#39;m have to argue semantics here.  You effectively argue that we are<br/>
powerful - and even &quot;not-underpowered&quot;.  The power you describe here is one<br/>
that makes it easy for us to get into groups - especially given the small<br/>
number of bards in general.  The Druids and Rangers in my guild get<br/>
frustrated at how much more difficult it is for them to get in groups in,<br/>
say Karnor - while I get often get tells asking me if I&#39;m a group (even when<br/>
I don&#39;t have LFG flag on).<br/>
Arguing semantically even further - I could argue you have made not a single<br/>
argument towards power - only versatility - but that would pretty much be<br/>
arguing for arguing sake - I think you DO make a good arugment that bards<br/>
aren&#39;t underpowered and are consistently powerful vis-├á-vis other classes.<br/>
On the other hand, I have yet to see an effective argument by you or anyone<br/>
else that bards are &quot;Over&quot; Powered.  To be &quot;Over Powered&quot; would imply that<br/>
the class needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot;.  If we were overpowered - you would often<br/>
see people say &quot;we can&#39;t start this group until we have a bard&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
this said about clerics, enchanters, even Shaman, but never Bards.<br/>

i almost never solo.  i mean we are over powered with respect to other<br/>
classes in a group<br/>
setting, more so in broken groups than cle/enc/war groups, but the fact that<br/>
we can<br/>
make a group without a cleric, enchanter, OR warrior able to go deep into<br/>
sebilis or<br/>
howling stones or karnors seems pretty powerful to me.</div>
