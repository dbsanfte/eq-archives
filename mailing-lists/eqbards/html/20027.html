<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022653261">Well how many bards who play the game actually subscribe to this list or<br/>
read the Concert Hall board?  Maybe 10% if even that?  To this day I<br/>
continue to meet bards higher level than me who have no clue of all the<br/>
things they can do to improve their group.  Hell I met a 45 bard the other<br/>
day in LGuk who didn&#39;t know pixie strike interrupted casters or debuffed MR.<br/>
He thought all it did was stun the mob for a few seconds.  Its easy to play<br/>
a battle bard and sing mana song after combat.  Unfortunately IMO thats how<br/>
most bards play their character so thats how a lot of other classes view us<br/>
in regards to our usefulness.  The bards who know how to handle crowd<br/>
control, lament pull, and manage the mob&#39;s hate list are few and far<br/>
between.  The people on the thread who put bards on their dream group list<br/>
have likely grouped with those type of bards before and know how valuable we<br/>
can be.<br/>

Has anyone else been sent this thread or looked at it?<br/>

I read the thread and was appalled to see that bards, supposedly the best<br/>
group class according to &quot;The Vision&quot; were seldom listed as being desirable.<br/>
<br/>
This quote left me especially tanked off.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;A *good* Bard, i.e. one that puts away the stupid weapons and uses their<br/>
DoTs with instruments, managing mob agro properly, can add the the group.<br/>
But most Bards are clueless schmucks, so it isn&#39;t worth trying to educate<br/>
them as they flail away with their Yaks and no Double Attack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tanked wasn&#39;t the right word to use there ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have been emailed this thread by 6 people now!  A couple of them even<br/>
suggested it made sense and that since an enchanter was so much more vital<br/>
to a good group and basically rendered the bard obsolete, I should retire my<br/>
bard and work on getting one of my more viable classes leveled up.  It was<br/>
suggested, though never directly stated, that an enchanter made having a<br/>
bard more or less a waste of time unless you really needed manasong.<br/>
<br/>
Someone save me before I start screamin&#39; again.<br/>
