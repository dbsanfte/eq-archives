<div id="ygrps-yiv-851469115">If someone is going to suggest something, ask for it to be a party song<br/>

&gt; &gt;     It would be nice if the song would work when cast on items in a =<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade window.  This would allow us to help other players with No Drop/No =<br/>

&gt; Just tested/verified this.  Doesn&#39;t work.  You can&#39;t put nodrop items in the<br/>
&gt; trade window. <br/>
