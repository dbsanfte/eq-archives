<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772878976">I&#39;ll start working on this, hehe... I don&#39;t believe Kaearia&#39;s findings were published anywhere, and the ezboard search feature is horribly lacking, so I put up a post on Concert Hall asking for Kaearia to comment.  Hopefully, we&#39;ll have something soon. :)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to knock the source of the other findings, but Kaearia&#39;s usually so thorough in testwork and in findings that I&#39;d question anything that conflicted.  If the mana regen claims ARE true, it&#39;s probably something changed recently, and I&#39;d love to see data on it (if you can find that source).  I&#39;ll do my homework if you can do yours. :)<br/>
<br/>
Back onto the original topic, if the mana regen is what I&#39;ve always believed (~40 min to regen a full mana bar while sitting?), I think the extra mana drain (from refreshing more often) and the shorter duration (from going oom sooner) of using charm for CC or Kiting would be a fair trade off for a refreshable charm.  In indoor settings, I see the biggest problem with increasing power, because you&#39;ll be avoiding damage you&#39;d otherwise be taking, but for outdoor use, that damage would have been avoided anyway the way charm work before the accidental breakage.<br/>

  &gt;Kaeria&#39;s findings before I&#39;d trust anyone else&#39;s.  Kaeria&#39;s findings<br/>
  &gt;show that NO mana regen works on Bards except sitting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I looked up the info on eqsongs.com and figured that perhaps I had misread <br/>
  Kaearia&#39;s info as to affecting bards as well. If you have a quote directly <br/>
  from Kaearia that shows his analysis, I&#39;d love to read it.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
