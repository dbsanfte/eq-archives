<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575197737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; A while back I posted on this list that it seemed the people playing<br/>
&gt; wizards on the newer servers are complete idiots. Now, I have to say, at<br/>
&gt; higher levels the idiot wizards are gone, but in their place we have<br/>
&gt; idiot mages. Maybe that&#39;s where all the wizards went, I don&#39;t know, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m seeing a lot of early 40&#39;s mages now on Tribunal who are probably<br/>
&gt; just starting to group for the first time in their careers, after<br/>
&gt; camping guards for 40 levels, and it is horrible to group with them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Once Verant killed the ability for Wizards to solo as much as they used<br/>
  to, I think those same people made Mages because they were easy to<br/>
  level.  It&#39;s funny to watch a Mage demand that he/she be allowed to<br/>
  alternate in guard killing, when a 3 or 4 person group is knocking<br/>
  them out left and right, exp isn&#39;t as great, but downtime is low.<br/>
  In Feerrott that translates into Hurd&#39;s, Flerb&#39;s, Prud&#39;s, and the<br/>
  other one&#39;s corpses all laying on the ground side by side.  And this<br/>
  mage insists she should have her &#39;solo&#39; cut.  heh.  They need a <br/>
  /getlost emote.  <br/>
<br/>
  That said, I&#39;ve been with a Mage who 1) not only knows how to control<br/>
  his pets, but knows when and how to use them effectively, 2) always<br/>
  has shield of lava on the tanks (I love it), 3) Burns effectively<br/>
  enough so that (unlike most wizards who chain cast IC) keeps the<br/>
  mobs on the tanks and not on him running around screaming like wizards<br/>
  do.  It&#39;s like no sh*t you idiot wizard, you just pumped 3330 dmg into<br/>
  that mob, and you are whining about it being all over you.  heh.<br/>
<br/>
  Shamans are the worst are learning how to keep their pets under control<br/>
  I must add.  It&#39;s always a wolf pet who is out agro&#39;ing trains and<br/>
  such.  Necros by far have the most intuned sense of pet manipulation<br/>
  and battleflow.  Not only can necros pace the battle to keep mobs off<br/>
  them, but the can inflict serious dmg while doing so.  I admire the<br/>
  health to mana to health conversion they can perform with a manastone.<br/>
  It&#39;s simply amazing.  Plus those L49 pets are incredible when used<br/>
  properly.<br/>
<br/>
  My take on casters,<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
