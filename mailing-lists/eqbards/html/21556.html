<div id="ygrps-yiv-170792462">I posted a while back about having problems in Skyfire charming - thinking<br/>
it was High-Blues resists.  Reading other posts (I think on the Backstage<br/>
board) - I realized I was sending pets after Chromodrakes - who would then<br/>
dispel my Charm spell...<br/>
<br/>
I had forgotten that Charm was a dispel able spell affect.  Chock it up to<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
I had another circumstance I wanted to bounce off all of you here.  I fought<br/>
in Sebelis for the time a couple of nights ago.  It was a complete bust.<br/>
First of all - I get there - and here someone yelling for more for group.  I<br/>
tell the guy (a druid 53 I think) that I&#39;m interested he says OK.  I wait<br/>
5-10 minutes and hear nothing from the guy and wonder what the heck is going<br/>
on.  He then says he has to TP out to get other people.<br/>
<br/>
Now I was 48 (actually about 10 kills form 49 at that point) - and a bit<br/>
underpowered for the zone - so I don&#39;t do what I might otherwise - ie look<br/>
for another group.  So I patiently wait.  A good 20-30 minutes later (not<br/>
exaggerating) the guy shows up with the group.  Then the cleric announces<br/>
she forgot to bind outside the dungeon - so she&#39;s gonna run for the zone out<br/>
to go bind.<br/>
<br/>
She then proceeds to get killed on the way.  Okay - here&#39;s where the<br/>
confusion goes in.  The rogue is gonna hide/sneak to find the corpse.<br/>
Needless to say - I&#39;m singing Mana non-stop - and he tells me to stop<br/>
singing it because it&#39;s messing up his hide.<br/>
<br/>
The rogue comes back - having trouble find it.  The cleric tp&#39;s in.  We<br/>
decide to do some pulls before searching again.  After we kill one and the<br/>
rogue heads out again - I figure it&#39;s safe to sing mana again - the rogue<br/>
has to be WAY out of range.  Heck I know from group chat he&#39;s past a couple<br/>
of doors.  I even ask the group if it&#39;s okay to sing mana since the guy is<br/>
out of range.  I THOUGHT I got an affirmative response (in hindsight -<br/>
perhaps the Ranger was responding to another question - but I certain never<br/>
got a negative).<br/>
<br/>
Shortly thereafter a nasty train appears out of nowhere (didn&#39;t see a player<br/>
run in either) 3 golums of some sort - and a couple other.  We die very<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
The group then blames me singing mana song for the train.  My question to<br/>
the more experienced peoples here - is this true - or did these people not<br/>
know what they are talking about?  If my singing mana - while a group member<br/>
was deeper in the dungeon caused a group of mobs to aggro on the main group<br/>
back at the zone entrance - then clearly it&#39;s a bug (given the extremely<br/>
small range of the Mana song).  Regardless - if there is such a bug - I need<br/>
to be aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
The night went even worse.  After searching the way to the exit zone for a<br/>
long time - we assumed the corpse was in a wall.  Petitioned - guides did<br/>
come pretty quickly - and told us to &quot;look harder&quot;.  Turns out the cleric<br/>
made a wrong turn.<br/>
<br/>
So we decide to try to clear way to corpse.  We go past the first door - and<br/>
there&#39;s another group there.  One member says &quot;sorry I have to leave&quot; and<br/>
then joins other group.  There are still five of us (including the &quot;naked&quot;<br/>
cleric).  Then the Druid group leader - disbands the group and tp&#39;s out<br/>
without saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
Now keep in mind - we&#39;ve been at this over 3 hours and haven&#39;t done diddly.<br/>
If the guy said something - I would understand (to some degree) - but he<br/>
didn&#39;t even respond to tells asking &quot;what happened to group&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am - in Sebelis for the first time - don&#39;t know my way around and<br/>
no group.  I yell for group a couple of times - and don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
I figure I&#39;d be safer going back to the entrance (and then start asking<br/>
people what to do or for a TP out).  I didn&#39;t know that mobs spawn at the<br/>
door.  I then proceed to train the people at the entrance and get killed.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately - a Druid in my guild was bound outside the entrance - went<br/>
there - got me a rez and TP&#39;d me out...<br/>
<br/>
I decided to sticking with some friends (who were in Karnor and needed a<br/>
bard - where I proceeded to regain lost XP and ding to 49.<br/>
