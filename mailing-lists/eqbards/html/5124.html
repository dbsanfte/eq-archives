<div id="ygrps-yiv-461078436">Did you put at least one pratice point into your wind skill?  If you did, <br/>
you might have to practice your wind skill up using your lv 16 song.  Since <br/>
the charisma song is not continuous.. it is impossible to raise your wind <br/>
skill with it.  Trust me, you will want your wind skill to be capped when <br/>
you hit 19.<br/>

&gt;I have a question on this song.  I am a level 17 bard, and just recently <br/>
&gt;acquired this song.  I equipped my flute, and tried to play it.  I got the <br/>
&gt;following message:  Learn to sing it before you play it.  I proceeded to <br/>
&gt;try and sing it, and could never get it going.  Nothing but one missed note <br/>
&gt;after the other.  Is this common?  Am I doing something wrong?  Also, do I <br/>
&gt;need a mouthpiece for my flute?  I bought the flute from the Bard&#39;s Guild, <br/>
&gt;and eqipped it as usual before I tried the song.  Any help at all would be <br/>
&gt;greatly appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>
