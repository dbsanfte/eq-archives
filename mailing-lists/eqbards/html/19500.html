<br/>
I haven&#39;t noticed resists in Kunark being unusually high, except for Iksars.<br/>
They are apparently immune to charm and resist a lot better than similar<br/>
level mobs.  In addition they are smart enough to ignore your &#39;pet&#39; while<br/>
charming.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to do fear/chains a bit in FM last night since its not something I<br/>
consider myself proficient at.  Learned that there are way too many<br/>
wanderers there to do it effectively.  Did figure that if I was unmolested I<br/>
could beat a Sarnak Dragoon that just became blue to me, but I&#39;d take<br/>
several bubs of damage due to resists.<br/>
<br/>
Burynai btw seem to be magic resistance deficient.  I had to charm a yellow<br/>
Digmaster when it got involved in my Dragoon fight.  It never resisted on<br/>
about 30 charms.  Of course I had to flee from it after it killed the<br/>
Dragoon anyhow since it took about a sliver of counterattack damage from the<br/>
Dragoon.<br/>
