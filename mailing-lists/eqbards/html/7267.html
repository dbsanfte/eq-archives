<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773522529"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My sole saving grace is I get hit less often than he does even <br/>
&gt;with a worse AC because I dodge more, even though our dodge skill<br/>
&gt;is only 5 points different.  Now if they gave wood elves a defense <br/>
&gt;bonus to compensate for the low hit points maybe it would even out, <br/>
&gt;but right now I can&#39;t do enough more damage, even with dual wield, <br/>
&gt;to account for his greater hit points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ugh... is this conversation still going on?  I tried to duel a few<br/>
druids and shamans last night, and I said, oh and you cannot use<br/>
any spells... pure melee.  No one accepted.  Thus showing how badly<br/>
they would get whupped.<br/>
<br/>
At level 19, high dual wield, and mostly bronze armor, my AC was<br/>
over 500... There is nothing that cleric can wear that you cant.<br/>
This isn&#39;t an armor issue, you both can wear the same armor.<br/>
This isn&#39;t about dodge because as I recall clerics have close<br/>
to the same dodge as us.  This isn&#39;t about defense because they<br/>
have about the same defense too.  You hp is extremely similar,<br/>
you may have a little lower hp, but not more than 10% difference.<br/>
<br/>
What this all boils down to is the Bard&#39;s ability to effectively<br/>
wield two fast medium power slashing/piercing weapons.  Clerics<br/>
have no recourse in weapons, other than high dmg -or- high delay.<br/>
Maybe this isn&#39;t as clear in the first 20 levels, but as I get<br/>
close to level 40, my melee is counting more and more, as I almost<br/>
always dual wield, and average about 20 - 25 total dmg per round.<br/>
That&#39;s nothing compared to a paladin or ranger, our other &#39;hybrid&#39;<br/>
brothers, who can do up around avg 40 - 60 total dmg per round.<br/>
<br/>
With similar AC, hp, defense, dodge... and much much better melee<br/>
skills and dual wield, I don&#39;t understand why this conversation <br/>
continues =)   In fact it&#39;s becoming pointless.  We usually fight<br/>
monsters, not other druids/shaman/clerics. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
