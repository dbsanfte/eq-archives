<div id="ygrps-yiv-860359665">You can forage some if not all the new items at 40 but it is incredibly<br/>
unlikely.  The forage skill mods the list to see what you forage in terms of<br/>
common/rare from what I&#39;ve observed so far in the short span.  From what<br/>
I&#39;ve heard about the trap and lock inclusions in the expansion those skills<br/>
will become very useful for rogues and totally useless for us as locks and<br/>
traps will have a difficulty that will make our low skill unuseable in the<br/>
areas where they will be found.<br/>

Everyone knows that Bard forage caps at 40 right?  There is some concern<br/>
floating about that a minimum skill of 100 in forage is required to get the<br/>
new unique items people are finding in the different zones.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bit of good news, I foraged an &quot;ash root&quot; last night (I think it<br/>
was in Kithcor) and later foraged a normal &quot;root&quot; in HighKeep.  They were<br/>
definitely separate items and did not stack with one another (much like the<br/>
old berries and fruit that have been around and have the same graphic).<br/>
<br/>
Any other bards on this list found any of the unique new forage items yet<br/>
too?<br/>
<br/>
BTW - my forage is maxed at the cap, 40.<br/>
