<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487820142"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This has nothing to do with bard discussion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talies, can we get this Kabong&#39;d as well as maybe have this <br/>
&gt; person removed <br/>
&gt; from the list if you think it&#39;s warranted? I&#39;d really hate to see us <br/>
&gt; getting spammed with stuff like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(a) It&#39;s at least relevant to EQ<br/>
<br/>
(b) It&#39;s academic and not for profit<br/>
<br/>
I hate spam as much as the next person, but I&#39;m inclined to let this one go.</div>
