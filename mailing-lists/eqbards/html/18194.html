<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889407188">Yes, I&#39;m fighting in Kunor too but with my charisma gear on against the same type of MOBs (since I&#39;m<br/>
doing quite a bit of charming also).  So far no complaints on the resist rates.  It&#39;s nice to get all 3<br/>
chants to stick most of the time (unlike fighting Fire Giants =( )...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been using the chant series like CRAZY in Kunark with almost<br/>
&gt; &gt;0 resists.  On the other hand, the few<br/>
&gt; &gt;times I&#39;ve whipped out my Kisch, I think I&#39;ve had 100% resists<br/>
&gt; &gt;against its poison proc (which is almost<br/>
&gt; &gt;never resisted on Antonica).  Perhaps it is the type of the Kunark<br/>
&gt; &gt;mob you are fighting?  Perhaps too it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is charisma related.  Currently I&#39;m up to a whopping 160 unbuffed now.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; You are very lucky. Windsong (I look over her shoulder)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; was getting almost constant resists last night. Two<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I can think of in particular are Chant and Pixie<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Strike<br/>
