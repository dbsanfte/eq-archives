remove Brian).  Funny thing is, he&#39;s been subscribed since November 1999 - <br/>
almost as long as I have - and he &quot;doesn&#39;t know who we are&quot;???<br/>

Freaks.<br/>

Heck, I haven&#39;t even loaded EQ in over 6 months (beta-testing Earth and <br/>
Beyond, plus playing NWN, and about a dozen other games...), so I have no <br/>
clue what&#39;s going on anymore.  But I&#39;m still here for y&#39;all...<br/>
