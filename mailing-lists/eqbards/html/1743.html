&gt;I too swear I saw a mermaid while swimming in South Qeynos waiting for the<br/>
&gt;boat. It was certainly not a shark. Yet when I swam to where it was, there<br/>
&gt;was nothing there (I was to dumb or dumbfounded to /con it). I have asked<br/>
&gt;many if they had seen one, but people kept saying that there are none in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;game. While I have yet to go all &quot;Ahab&quot; and devote my life to hunting one<br/>
&gt;down, it is nice to hear I am not alone in this rare sighting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, has anyone ever swam to the bottom of the lake in West Commonlands? I<br/>
&gt;swam to the bottom and was teleported to the zone wall it shares with East<br/>
&gt;Commonlands. The text sayed that I was being moved to a safe place or<br/>
&gt;something like that. It has happened repeatedly and I swear that I saw<br/>
&gt;something down there too, though, alas I do not recall the /loc of the<br/>
&gt;object.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This list is a wonderful source of information, but it took another mermaid<br/>
&gt;sighting to get me to leave Lurkerville.<br/>

you swim down into it, you are teleported to the inland end of<br/>
the dock.<br/>
