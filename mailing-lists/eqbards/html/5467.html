<b>Subject:</b> Chief Dooga and the Ogre camp <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142227662">From my experience, Chief Dooga is about level 35.<br/>
I haven&#39;t consed him at this level yet but I&#39;ve done<br/>
so at lvl 30 and 31. He was red to me. The other<br/>
ogres in the camp seem to be in the low 20s at the<br/>
most. They were blue to me at lvl 26 when I first<br/>
forayed into that area. <br/>
<br/>
Also, the reason I&#39;ve heard that these ogres cons <br/>
amiable is that they have some kind of buff cast<br/>
on them benevolence or alliance or the shaman <br/>
equivalent of those spells and that&#39;s why they cons<br/>
amiable. I could be wrong though.<br/>
