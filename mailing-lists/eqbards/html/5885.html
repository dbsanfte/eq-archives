<b>Subject:</b> RE: What to do with a bad bard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257187628">Windolas - man am I sorry to know that someone on our list would do such a<br/>
thing.  I had no idea this was your post and it was not my intent to make it<br/>
a personal issue here - I said my personal piece over on the bard board.<br/>
But I do have to wonder why you are so proud of your actions over on the<br/>
bard board yet don&#39;t wanna trumpet your deeds here? <br/>
<br/>
To me - you got him killed and you wanted it to happen. - now you gotta drop<br/>
outta character and say &quot;death is part of the game...its only a game...it<br/>
was only a joke...it didn&#39;t really hurt anyone...&quot;  But in game you<br/>
intentionally did stuff wanting to get him killed.  So you killed a newbie -<br/>
wow!  What&#39;s next on your agenda - a fire beetle?<br/>
<br/>
To me - why did you do it? You were in a bad mood? You could not get a<br/>
group? You were jealous of someone with better stuff than you but obviously<br/>
lots less experienced.  So what did you do? You did something to make his in<br/>
game life miserable - that&#39;s not a joke he&#39;s gonna laugh at.<br/>
<br/>
To me - I could almost buy into your justification that you did it in<br/>
character of a rogue-bard - if you helped recover his stuff afterwards.  But<br/>
perhaps helping out of the bad spot you put him is is beyond your meager<br/>
skills as a bard in character or out of character. Could you do a CR if the<br/>
corpse was laying at Chief Goomba&#39;s feets? Could you get the right people to<br/>
come help him? Could you make him have some fun and maybe get something out<br/>
of the experience? More to the point - you didn&#39;t and you even said you went<br/>
/ignore on him when he was asking for help.  <br/>
<br/>
To me - the whole thing is very mean spirited.  In char and now out of char<br/>
with these wimpy excuses.  I have made a TON of mistakes. I have gotten my<br/>
best friends killed by my Stoopidity(tm).  But I know when and how to admit<br/>
my mistakes and say I am sorry!  <br/>
<br/>
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr,<br/>

Sylly,<br/>
  Firstly, I don&#39;t recall asking you to post this on<br/>
the list here, and wasnt bringing it here<br/>
too...however, since you have made it known, perhaps<br/>
you should calm down and look at the facts.<br/>
<br/>
First, look at some later posts.  We bards ARE INDEED<br/>
Rogues too.  Playing Jokes is something we do.</div>
