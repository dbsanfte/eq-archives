<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971526523"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Huh.  I make the run through the maze all the time, using Accelerando,<br/>
&gt; rarely see any eyes at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was early in the day when I went...the eyes must not have been hunted for<br/>
a while because there were a lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just run along the gorge floor, hugging the<br/>
&gt; left wall (from runnyeye, that is).  Used to get poked by the occasional<br/>
&gt; muddite, rarely happens to me anymore, waaaaay to fast for &#39;em &lt;grin&gt;  Of<br/>
&gt; course, if I do see an eye, I turn tail and run back and wait.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh...guess that means I can&#39;t just run past them and kick dust in their<br/>
eye. &lt;g&gt;  So they cast too fast to get past them safely?<br/>
