<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303133060">Ack, yes, I meant to announce this. <br/>
Basically, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed down<br/>
without being damaged. <br/>
There was a particular exploit where two bards could get together, play this<br/>
song (the level 54 one), and the Fear song, and any NPCs in the effect range<br/>
would stop dead in their tracks and not fight back when being killed. <br/>
I&#39;ll announce it in the addendum that I&#39;ll post shortly. <br/>
