Every Monday we should all post to the gameplay forum<br/>
asking: &quot;Is Ester back from vacation and has she given<br/>
you an answer on changes to the song yet?&quot;<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t been under a rock. (although it may have<br/>
&gt; been safer there, maybe I<br/>
&gt; should try it) I&#39;ve seen and contributed to many of<br/>
&gt; the posts. But when I<br/>
&gt; read Abashi&#39;s reply, I honestly believe he has<br/>
&gt; absolutely no idea what we<br/>
&gt; are talking about when we reference the problems<br/>
&gt; with chains and lullaby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quote:<br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not sure what is supposed to be wrong with<br/>
&gt; chains. Some changes were<br/>
&gt; put in to put in a maximum amount that a creature<br/>
&gt; could be slowed prior to<br/>
&gt; applying any slowing related to damage. The change<br/>
&gt; was intentional.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that<br/>
&gt; Ester, the one who was<br/>
&gt; going to look at this, is on vacation, and I&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt; to check with her when<br/>
&gt; she gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may<br/>
&gt; remember someone<br/>
&gt; stating that lullaby&#39;s current functionality is<br/>
&gt; intended, as it&#39;s the only<br/>
&gt; thing to keep them from trivializing encounters.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll have to check with<br/>
&gt; Ester when she gets back to be sure.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like you, I refuse to believe they are outright<br/>
&gt; lying, so I come to the<br/>
&gt; conclusion that he has no clue. He remembers the<br/>
&gt; patch that nerfed chains,<br/>
&gt; but he doesn&#39;t know how it affected the lower level<br/>
&gt; song. Again with<br/>
&gt; lullaby, he remembers the last time it was looked<br/>
&gt; at, but doesn&#39;t know that<br/>
&gt; we still see a HUGE problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m hopelessly optimistic and refuse to see<br/>
&gt; the truth that is evident,<br/>
&gt; but I just can&#39;t imagine that he knows and is<br/>
&gt; covering it up. Instead I<br/>
&gt; think that he is hopelessly swamped by email,<br/>
&gt; message board postings and<br/>
&gt; whatever other work he may have and in that mountain<br/>
&gt; of information, ours<br/>
&gt; got pushed to the bottom and  never seen.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I generally try to be open-minded, but...<br/>
&gt; I agree with you on the experience parts of your<br/>
&gt; post, not a big deal, and<br/>
&gt; its not going to change.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the song related parts of your post though, have<br/>
&gt; you been living under a<br/>
&gt; rock for the last 6 months?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There have been numerous postings to the EQ boards,<br/>
&gt; emails directly to GZ<br/>
&gt; and Abashi, posts on the EQ_Caster&#39;s Board (which<br/>
&gt; they do read), as well as<br/>
&gt; messages sent thru Baelish (runs EQ_Casters, talks<br/>
&gt; to GZ nearly daily).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of these posts have contained ridiculously<br/>
&gt; detailed information on the<br/>
&gt; problems with the broken songs.  John Kim and myself<br/>
&gt; have broken the things<br/>
&gt; down statistically to the point where it was readily<br/>
&gt; apparent that the<br/>
&gt; resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with<br/>
&gt; variances of +/- 2 tenths<br/>
&gt; of a percent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know what we think is<br/>
&gt; wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They<br/>
&gt; ARE ignoring us.<br/>
&gt; (Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>
&gt; Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case<br/>
&gt; they are purposely<br/>
&gt; lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Kitasi Faegehearper<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have<br/>
&gt; no idea that we think<br/>
&gt; there is a problem that needs to be looked at.<br/>
&gt; Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and<br/>
&gt; hope that he missed our<br/>
&gt; posts or forgot them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) If we can make them aware of what we think is<br/>
&gt; wrong, then we can get them<br/>
&gt; to look at it and there is a possibility that we can<br/>
&gt; get it fixed. This to<br/>
&gt; me is good news. The only problem is how to get our<br/>
&gt; thoughts looked at. I<br/>
&gt; suggest we write up a concise description of the<br/>
&gt; problems. (insane resist<br/>
&gt; rates on pixie strike and lullaby and<br/>
&gt; ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>
&gt; patch) then we post it to the bug board and the<br/>
&gt; gameplay board, as well as<br/>
&gt; emailing it to abashi.<br/>
