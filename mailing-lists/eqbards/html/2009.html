<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dragoon Dirk (off topic somewhat?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-124046865">I recently got a Dragoon Dirk, but frankly I went to the zone because I wanted to<br/>
give DVinn some payback for all the times he killed me when I was Level 9-11 in<br/>
trains. I very much enjoyed clomping him with a few others. When I went to CB, it<br/>
was 7 am eastern, and there were only 3 people in the zone higher then level 15.<br/>
A level 17 wiz, a 21 ranger, and myself, a 19 Bard. We grouped together, had to<br/>
clear the entire castle ourselves (not really that hard, all the legionaires were<br/>
green at 19th) then kill the royal guard. Fortunately for us Dvinn spawned after<br/>
we&#39;d been able to bring Crush and the Prohpet into the main throne room.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt I am the only one who likes to get special item firsthand, and<br/>
I don&#39;t mean by paying for them. I found the whole time I spent getting the<br/>
Dragoon Dirk to be alot of fun. Yes, we killed DVinn a second time so that the<br/>
wizard could have one, and I was wow&#39;d by the fact the dagger had better stats<br/>
then my Combine Long Sword. But as long as fighting the upper caste of Crushbone<br/>
isn&#39;t reduced to sitting and waiting for them with 20 other players, I must say<br/>
it was a VERY rewarding fight from an enjoyment perspective. Take THAT Dvinn! And<br/>
Dorn watch out, you&#39;re next! *smiles*<br/>
