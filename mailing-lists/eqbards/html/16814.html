<div id="ygrps-yiv-326104375">Bah!  All i ever said about this song is that if you sit it regens faster.<br/>
Sheesh i haven&#39;t memmed it in 6 months.<br/>

And short but sweet, I agree with Kevin.  I don&#39;t want all our songs<br/>
mana-based.  It doesn&#39;t fit how bards work.  I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t like the<br/>
song ideas and think our new songs will be as good as they should be, I just<br/>
don&#39;t want to rely on mana to be able to do sing them.  I think Dirge should<br/>
have had a timer reset like LH, HT, or DA instead of using our mana.  When<br/>
they implemented the song, GZ said he only used mana to limit how often we<br/>
used it.  It was not really a mana-based song, they just used mana as a<br/>
timer instead of doing it the right way (couldn&#39;t they keep the song slot<br/>
grayed out like divine aura until they wanted us to use it again?).  And if<br/>
they did that right, we wouldn&#39;t even be talking about songs using mana<br/>
right now cause it never would have happened and we never would have thought<br/>
of it.  Dammit that wasn&#39;t short or sweet =)<br/>

&gt;   (And no, Shada, I&#39;m not a caster, I don&#39;t sit my bard down ever)<br/>
&gt;   It takes an hour for 90%+ of the bard population to regain mana for<br/>
&gt;   this song, because I know I have hidden my &#39;Sit&#39; button since I <br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t use it.  Needless to say the song is a waste.  It requires<br/>
&gt;   mana, but for the wrong reason. </span></blockquote></div>
