&gt; My solution was disgustingly overly simple and general.  Part of the<br/>
&gt; design of the dungeon was to make the foo widgets interesting.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; in Guk, they are pages of a tome which tell the story of why the Frogs<br/>
&gt; and trolls hate each other so much (ok that may not be too great) or<br/>
&gt; what happened in Lower Guk (IE why are all those undead there).  When<br/>
&gt; you finally get the &quot;container&quot; (the actual tome), you have achieved an<br/>
&gt; understanding of the Froglok people (and why they flip in combat) and<br/>
&gt; thus worthy of recieving the greatest treasuere of the Frogloks (a short<br/>
&gt; sword of foo fighting).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It might also be me, but I dont really the &quot;rare drop&quot; concept.  If I do<br/>
&gt; the quest, I want the reward, I don&#39;t want to kill him 25 times to get<br/>
&gt; the reward. (I did the bullsmasher quest 48 times!, leveled 5<br/>
&gt; characters  Rare drops are just a way to keep people entertained while<br/>
&gt; doing the same darn thing over and over again.  Then again without them,<br/>
&gt; the world would have to be pretty darn massive since you would need alot<br/>
&gt; more zones.  We can all dream eh?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, this solution sounds very very much like the approach they took in<br/>
Asheron&#39;s Call... too bad that game made mistakes in other places.  Some day<br/>
there will be an RPG where they get it right.  Someday, the worlds will be<br/>
so massive that a unique spawn is just that, unique.  If someone kills it,<br/>
it will never spawn again.  Someday the servers will be able to handle the<br/>
variety of a million unique items and create on the fly another unique NPC<br/>
to interact with who happens to get the job guarding the front gate when the<br/>
captain gets assassinated...  someday there will be an RPG that isn&#39;t level<br/>
based and creates an evolving virtual world that keeps our interest and<br/>
doesn&#39;t require nerfing every class.  Someday...<br/>

By the way, am I the ONLY Prexus person that subscribes to this list?<br/>
