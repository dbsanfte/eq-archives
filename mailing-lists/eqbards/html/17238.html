<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519873405"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Incorrect.  At level 34 a Ranger can kick for up to 23 points.  Kick<br/>
&gt; &gt; recycles about every 10 seconds.  So no, this is incorrect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; our bellow at level 34 is 18dmg.  how often can we do it, every 6 seconds?<br/>
&gt; (god i feel stupid i don&#39;t know this but i haven&#39;t bellowed other than for<br/>
&gt; pulling for 9 months).  anyway let&#39;s say 6 seconds, so in a minute we can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 180dmg, and in a minute a ranger can do 138dmg with kick<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point made was that we could do more twisting bellow every 3rd song.  In<br/>
that case we are doing far less than the ranger.   I know Bellow does more<br/>
over time, but twisted with 2 or 3 other songs a melee class will do more<br/>
with kick/bash.  Bash also has the added bonus that it interrupts casting.<br/>
Kick is more like bellow though<br/>
in that it is just straight dmg (with a tiny knockback).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Now, as to this comparison of Melee dmg.  Why are we<br/>
&gt; &gt; comparing our 2nd rate<br/>
&gt; &gt; dmg method to other hybrid&#39;s 1st rate dmg method?  Our #1<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage producer is<br/>
&gt; &gt; our songs.  Our songs vastly outdamage any hybrid&#39;s damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; curve when used<br/>
&gt; &gt; correctly.  If I twist CoC, DDD, CoD, NiV with my 50 bard on Test I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage very comparable to what a ranger or paladin or<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadowknight of equal<br/>
&gt; &gt; level can do.  Add to that my ability to regen mana for<br/>
&gt; &gt; others, heal others,<br/>
&gt; &gt; speed others combat up etc.  I&#39;d say that Bards are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearly as bad off as<br/>
&gt; &gt; many seem to paint us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a combo of songs is very powerful, but wouldn&#39;t you say the big downside<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that being AE we have to attack multiple targets with them (and thus get<br/>
&gt; pounded on by multiple mobs), and they have a very high resist rate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>against<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; similarly levelled mobs (especially at 50).  whereas meleeing has the plus<br/>
&gt; of not being resisted (in a sense, no you don&#39;t always hit and don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>always<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hit for max) and being on a single target.  i&#39;d love some single target<br/>
&gt; damage songs, and i heard our chant songs were recently really fixed, so i<br/>
&gt; may break those out and give them a try.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As with anything, that depends vastly on the situation.  There are many<br/>
times when I can fight with our AE songs just fine against 1 target.<br/>
Against 2 targets (at least till the mobs are over 37) I charm one, then<br/>
kill the winner :)  I rarely have a hard time making my songs stick on<br/>
anything that isn&#39;t deep (5+ levels) red to me.  And _any_ caster has to<br/>
deal with resists.  Bards are more of a caster hybrid than a melee hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bottom line:  Bards are not a melee class in the classic<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense.  Yes, we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and should) get in there and mix it up.  But no, we aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant to be up<br/>
&gt; &gt; there swinging swords all the time.  90% of the time our<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs are our best<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; nod.  nice thread, and i like hearing your point of view as you&#39;ve been in<br/>
&gt; the game for so long, even if we all don&#39;t agree all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe that&#39;s primarily what this game is all about.  Points of view.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think we need more defensive skills.  IMHO:  Our offense is<br/>
fine.  I can solo blues as well as any melee class can.  I can contribute<br/>
more to a group than any melee can.  But I cant defend myself worth a darn.<br/>
Bards need dodge cap raised (significantly) and we should at least get parry<br/>
as well, if not both Parry and Riposte ;)  It&#39;s on test now, hopefully it&#39;s<br/>
going to stay in for Kunark (not holding my breath and I still think thats<br/>
WAY too late to be adding those).<br/>
