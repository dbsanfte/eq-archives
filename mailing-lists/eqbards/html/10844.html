<div id="ygrps-yiv-653489624">Wow, must be the random number generator at work again.  I saw Babbinsbort<br/>
twice in one evening and we killed him both times.  I have seen Zahal at<br/>
least a half dozen times, twice when I had to flee in abject terror while I<br/>
was pulling Griffawns.  I have only seen Bilge twice, but both times<br/>
together he lived a total of about 30 seconds.  Haven&#39;t done the OOT stuff,<br/>
but our guild Cleric has killed Gull three times.  Why did they think Babbs<br/>
only spawns every 7.5 hours?  Unless something is different from server to<br/>
server he spawned on ours twice in a 4-5 hour period.  Maybe 3 times<br/>
including the placeholder Mob, can&#39;t remember for sure if we killed<br/>
something else in that spot but we definitely nailed him twice in that<br/>
period.  I don&#39;t get to play all that much being only 21st level despite<br/>
playing since first week of April so either I&#39;m very lucky with stupid<br/>
cleric mobs or it differs from server to server for some reason.  Maybe<br/>
those spawns are triggered somehow and we just happened to do the unknown<br/>
triggering action more often.<br/>
On the other hand while I can defeat those cleric needed mobs I have seen, I<br/>
cannot come close to beating a Hill giant or Griff.  In the 10 levels or so<br/>
between now and the time I can beat those HG&#39;s and Griffs I imagine I could<br/>
see all the cleric mobs many times if I chose to.<br/>

&gt;all it requires is time.  To get the gauntlets you have to kill...<br/>
&gt;Babbinsbort, please.  I have already killed him twice at 21st level in a<br/>
&gt;group where I was the highest level there at 20.  Greaves, kill Maugrim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Babbinsbort or his placeholder spawns every 7.5 hours.  A cleric friend of <br/>
mine made sure that he was at that spawn point every 7.5 hours for 2 weeks <br/>
before he finally spawned. That NPC has been seen on our server exactly 2 <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
Bilge in the Cauldron has been seen once on our server.<br/>
<br/>
3 days of solid camping on that island in OOT yielded that stupid bird.<br/>
<br/>
We killed enough griffennes to get 4 charms in north karana, and in the time<br/>
<br/>
it took to do that never saw Zahal.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric quests are almost impossible not because of the level of NPC <br/>
required to kill them but because of the rarity of the NPC&#39;s that carry the <br/>
items required.<br/>
<br/>
So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>
That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>
on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>
this quest, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my cleric friend has pretty much given up on the quests and doesn&#39;t <br/>
bitch about it non stop anymore. He&#39;s not even going to try to get the <br/>
breastplate, the one piece he can&#39;t get because Bilge won&#39;t spawn, and he&#39;s <br/>
given up on the bracers because that stupid ghoul in NK won&#39;t spawn either.<br/>
