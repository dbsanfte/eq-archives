<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468568381">Which is why I said in an earlier post that the possibility does exist that<br/>
Verant would change the binding policy somewhere down the road to accomodate<br/>
the melee/hybrid casters.   If we provide Verant with a viable option on how<br/>
to implement the change, they just might consider it. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I think at some point Verant will have to decide how to keep players in<br/>
&gt; the game who have less time to play on a regular basis and still keep<br/>
&gt; those more fortunate  ones who can play more interested.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is going to happen when Kunark comes online with an evil city?  Will<br/>
&gt; there be a place for the good races to bind or will Verant see it as a<br/>
&gt; challenge for good players to adventure there since its a boat ride from<br/>
&gt; their nearest reasonable bind<br/>
&gt; point if they aren&#39;t a binder? </span></blockquote></div>
