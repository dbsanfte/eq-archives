<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-590239475">There are many of these abound. Druid regen must be cast before Hymn of <br/>
Restoration is used or it will not take hold. Another one that you high <br/>
level ppl might or might not know about - Lvl 48 DoT will cause a shaman or <br/>
enchanter Yawn Mob spell to not stick while it is in effect(I don&#39;t know <br/>
what these spells are called, I just say YAWN!) But I have no problem <br/>
getting the DoT to stick after they have Yawned the mob. Shaman friend of <br/>
mine claims he cannot use quickness on me when my speed songs are in effect, <br/>
but an enchanter friend has never complained about that (haven&#39;t formally <br/>
tested it). It&#39;s kinda hard to tell in real-time if all the haste effects <br/>
are stacking when you wear a sash, use bard speed attack songs, and have a <br/>
quickness type spell on ya (well it is for me). John? =) The icons show <br/>
stacked at least.<br/>
<br/>
I would assume that if Chords of Cessation&#39;s slowing effect is messing up a <br/>
shaman&#39;s Yawn, the lvl 20 chords of melodic binding song may do the same? <br/>
Again, haven&#39;t tested it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I highly suspect this is a bug related to the code that prevents bards from<br/>
&gt;being affected by any mana regeneration boosters.  Because the bard isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;affected when another bard&#39;s song pulses it doesn&#39;t detect a stacking<br/>
&gt;problem because the bard doesn&#39;t have the effect on him.<br/>
&gt;Another interesting stacking issue I discovered.  The yaulp proc&#39;d by the<br/>
&gt;screaming mace stacks with Warsong, but not with Anthem, except: If the<br/>
&gt;Screaming Mace procs before the anthem you get both effects.  If it procs<br/>
&gt;after Anthem is already up you get the your &quot;spell did not take effect&quot;<br/>
&gt;message and the Yaulp does not stick.  I thought that was odd as it was the<br/>
&gt;only order related stacking I had ever encountered.<br/>
&gt;That led me to question some of the apparent Hymn stacking we considered<br/>
&gt;long ago.  If a bard&#39;s song only checks on the opposing bard for stacking<br/>
&gt;which seems to be true, could two bards in the same group stand outside <br/>
&gt;each<br/>
&gt;other&#39;s area of effect but both having and intermediary person inside both<br/>
&gt;their areas of effect.  If they did would the person in both areas be <br/>
&gt;healed<br/>
&gt;doubly?  Something to check.  I know for sure that while I cannot play Hymn<br/>
&gt;if a higher level bard is, if I walk away from his area of effect I can <br/>
&gt;play<br/>
&gt;it even though we are in the same group.  Something for someone with good<br/>
&gt;analysis techniques like John (tm) to check.<br/>
