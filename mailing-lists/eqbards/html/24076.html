ANY bard that is wasting a song slot to sing this should be booted. Get a<br/>
cold stone, get a DE mask (I know level 3 bards with this), get a glowing<br/>
stone band, get a caster to cast ultra vision on you. WHATEVER. This song is<br/>
useless, and to try to justify it by saying that there are a few select uses<br/>
for it is being argumentative.<br/>
<br/>
This song rates up there with Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge, Melody of Ervaj and<br/>
Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord.<br/>

end of &#39;&#39;it is useless&#39;&#39;.  if you were a human bard without a dark elf mask,<br/>
i believe you would find it very useful.<br/>
