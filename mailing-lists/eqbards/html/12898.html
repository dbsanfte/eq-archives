 </span></blockquote>  Seriously speaking, I don&#39;t mind capitalization.  If someone has<br/>
  excellent points or a well thought out argument, it makes it nice<br/>
  to see emphasis on key issues.  That said, i use _this_ as my style<br/>
  of pulling a keyword out... but I do use it sparingly because in my<br/>
  mind it&#39;s all in your wording not which word is emphasized.<br/>
<br/>
  Most discussions I&#39;ve seen that take a turn for the worse ends this <br/>
  way, where the poster gets frustrated at attempting to explain their<br/>
  thoughts on a matter in a logical way.  Often at that point, people<br/>
  resort to trying to make others VERY aware of how &#39;they feel&#39; in the <br/>
  facing or style of their language.  At any rate, I&#39;m a fairly calm <br/>
  person who hates to seem like he&#39;s being YELLED at or &#39;talked down&#39; to.<br/>
  Most of the time that is not the intention, but then again I only know<br/>
  each of your through your choice of words in my e-mail window everyday.<br/>
<br/>
  And as this is a free-to-post list, there&#39;s not much my opinion<br/>
  on the matter counts.  It&#39;s just usenet and listserve courtesy<br/>
  which I&#39;m accustom to.<br/>
