&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Staff of writhing<br/>

&gt;From the EQLizer:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The staff of writhing is one of the various skull staff&#39;s in the game(which<br/>
&gt;look similar to the staff that the Priest of Discord is equipping). This<br/>
&gt;particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>
&gt;Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of<br/>
&gt;9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of chaotic feedback(which does 48<br/>
&gt;points of damage when successful).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t been impressed with most weapons I have seen so far, but this<br/>
&gt;sounds like a real treat. Any idea where to find one?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would be willing to train my 1H Blunt to use this, since it has a very<br/>
&gt;nice magical effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Working on using EQLizer for some complete weapon analysis, will post soon.<br/>

and then finding out it screws up bard songs I&#39;ve decided to stay away from <br/>
weapons that have an added magical effect (even though ppl are saying there <br/>
is a way around it).<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind getting a crystalline sword though =)<br/>
Anyone? Anyone??<br/>
