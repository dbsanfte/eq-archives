&gt; Nivs = 15hp / tic.  Hymn = 17hp/tic this=35hp/tic<br/>
&gt; Total= roughly 70hp/tic<br/>
&gt; I seriously doubt Verant will go for something like this that, on top of all<br/>
&gt; that, throws on Clarity, a spell shield, and whatever else nivs does.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  70 hp / tick when mobs can hit in the multiple hundreds? <br/>
<br/>
  I can heal for roughly mid 30s in lguk and things hit for 100.<br/>
  That&#39;s a third of the damage being done just in healing.<br/>
<br/>
  I would hope I could stick to that ratio, and heal 100 per tick<br/>
  when mobs can do 300-400 dmg per swing.<br/>
<br/>
  You are not thinking ahead, you are stuck in this shell of a <br/>
  broken game in the current state.  Thing are going to change.<br/>
  Our songs have to be excellent at L60 versus L63 NPCs.  No one<br/>
  is thinking down that path yet.  And it&#39;s even hard for me to.<br/>
  <br/>
  +75 STR, and you&#39;re like OMG, that&#39;s too much.  <br/>
<br/>
  -or-<br/>
<br/>
  +100 AC, *nothing* gives that much you think... well at L60 <br/>
  maybe it should.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe we should heal 150 per tick with a +50 AC shield, I mean<br/>
  when was the last L53+ mob you encountered without bringing <br/>
  24+ people.  We&#39;re gonna have to fight L53+ mobs in groups of<br/>
  six people, just like you fight L45 mobs in groups of six.<br/>
