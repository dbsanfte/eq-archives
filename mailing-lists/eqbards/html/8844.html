Try it on yourself.  Most of the time you will get the &quot;you<br/>
send forth music&quot; message and icon, but will not be stunned.  <br/>
If you wait for the icon to disappear, you will get the &quot;you<br/>
are no longer stunned&quot; message even though you were never<br/>
stunned!<br/>
<br/>
It *is* broken.<br/>

it is not broken!  I used it in lguk 2 days ago.  We were over swarm by 3<br/>
mobs.  So I used pixie strike on one of them and he was standing still for<br/>
10 second then started wacking again.  Then I sang pixie again then it stop.<br/>
The thing is you must stop fighting it and back off for the song to work.<br/>
But it  seems the duration is very unpredictable but the songs works.  I<br/>
also tried it on HG and it works too.  When I was in Rathe Mtn, I<br/>
accidentally pull 2 so I pixie on 1 and ran by real fast and it just stood<br/>
there and eventually I lost the HG.  it does work but not very reliable.<br/>
You just have to keep doing it.<br/>
