&gt; Case in point.  Last Friday I was camping the assasin room in LGuk for over<br/>
&gt; four hours.  There was at least 70 people in the zone at all times.  We<br/>
&gt; often had 5-10 minutes of downtime in between fights because we couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; find anything to pull.  I strongly considered singing DDD (still need to max<br/>
&gt; my brass skill:-) but could not convince my group that it was safe to do so.<br/>
