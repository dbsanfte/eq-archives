<b>Subject:</b> Problem with Bellow? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-284101550">All our other songs like Bellow will cycle and the other icons pop up a<br/>
couple seconds after the song does it&#39;s thing. This one doesn&#39;t seem to.<br/>
This song is supposed to stay gray until the interval for recast is done,<br/>
but the other icons should ungray when the song cycle is finished.<br/>
Essentially, the icons should work like a clerics DA/DB. I&#39;ve waited well<br/>
past the normal time that the other icons should come back up and they all<br/>
stay gray. It took me awhile to notice because I usually do twist and just<br/>
throw that one in when something is running, and my normal macro has<br/>
finished it&#39;s cycle of songs.<br/>
