<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104948200">I haven&#39;t had a chance to test this for myself but here is my take on some<br/>
of the changes:<br/>
<br/>
1)  If Chain cast on yourself breaks Root and Snare like Lost Child reports,<br/>
then the nerf of Selos not breaking root should only affect bards less than<br/>
23d level.  Still a major negative impact for newbies though.<br/>
<br/>
2)  If SOW overrides Selos, this can be a good thing if you are in a group<br/>
with someone who can cast SOW.  You no longer have to worry about<br/>
potentially screwing your party members over if you have to flee.  Having<br/>
SOW cast on you without your permission is still a major concern though and<br/>
I agree with Faras that we should be able to cancel the SOW similar to<br/>
Levitate.  <br/>
<br/>
3)  Chain is resisted more but works better.  Yesterday John Kim posted some<br/>
numbers that Chain reduced attack speed by around 25%.  Does that mean with<br/>
the new changes this % is even higher.  For the more experienced bards, is<br/>
this a good thing or would you rather have a higher chance for the spell to<br/>
work and keep the 25% reduced attack rate?<br/>

&gt; Here are the results of my test last night:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chain song is fixed!  No more spending 10 min chasing down a green SoWed <br/>
&gt; shaman!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chain song on self will still break snare when the song effect is over.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chain song on self will still break root, and when the song effect is<br/>
&gt; over, <br/>
&gt; you move at normal rate.<br/>
