<div id="ygrps-yiv-923178862">What would be cool, but probably impossible to implement, is a feature that<br/>
required you or your group to venture further into a dungeon in order to<br/>
find anything to fight.  For example, you enter Befallen and fight your<br/>
first fight.  In this scenario, the spawn doesn&#39;t reappear until you move on<br/>
further and fight the next spawn.  If you were to return to the first spawn,<br/>
it would give you no experience or loot.  The next group behind you can then<br/>
come in and fight the first spawn.  In this scenario, groups progress<br/>
through the dungeon until they get to the end.  Any nice reward would come<br/>
at the end when the group completes the dungeon by fighting the boss<br/>
creature.  If dungeons worked this way, Verant could design dungeons around<br/>
a specific level range.  As it stands right now, most dungeons are designed<br/>
for a large range of levels.  For example, in Unrest, you can survive at<br/>
15th level by camping the yard trash.  It takes someone high 20s/low 30s to<br/>
take on the big stuff in the basement.  The hard part would be determining<br/>
the order groups got to enter into the dungeon.  There would have to be some<br/>
form of cooperation or more GM/guide support but the task isn&#39;t impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just and idea thats probably been discussed before.  For you programmers,<br/>
how hard would it be to design something like this?  In the most recent<br/>
patch message, they state the Plane of Fear will be coded to prevent anyone<br/>
under level 46 from entering.  Seems like Verant could program dungeons like<br/>
that also were they to implement something like I suggested.<br/>

&gt; I know this is a long post, my friends, but it&#39;s probably my very last<br/>
&gt; post<br/>
&gt; to this group, so I appologize.  I apologize in advance for the language,<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; you are sensitive, stop now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no death in EverQuest, except psychologically.  And I&#39;m dying, I<br/>
&gt; think.<br/>
&gt; I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known in some years.   It is<br/>
&gt; highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy luggage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bored.  I&#39;m bored.  Thinking of quiting because of it.  Boredom, I<br/>
&gt; imagine,<br/>
&gt; would be probably the worst reason a designer would fear someone would<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt; up on their massive online game like this.  Boredom, really, is almost the<br/>
&gt; worst of an insult.  Someone is angry, that&#39;s better.  They feel<br/>
&gt; something,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re emotional about it, a love-turned-to-hate kind of thing,<br/>
&gt; acceptable<br/>
&gt; and expected.  But boredom?  Boredom, apathy, that&#39;s a lack of everything<br/>
&gt; good.  That would be scarry, at least if I were a developer, and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; I am: not a developer but bored.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah well, but boredom has it&#39;s good sides.  It&#39;s a slower kind of emotion,<br/>
&gt; lets you think.  When you&#39;re bored, you&#39;re less apt to just quit outright,<br/>
&gt; and instead ponder why, in fact, you ARE bored.  So I&#39;ve thought on it,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s off-topic but I couldn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass but I&#39;m posting it here<br/>
&gt; because this is the only discussion area I&#39;ve found where maybe someone<br/>
&gt; could say something, anything, though I somehow doubt it would help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>
&gt; Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions<br/>
&gt; suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central<br/>
&gt; to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do<br/>
&gt; you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for<br/>
&gt; items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.<br/>
&gt; And<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so<br/>
&gt; loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there<br/>
&gt; now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>
