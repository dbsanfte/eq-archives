the speed you need and the benefits of the other song.<br/>

		&lt;And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to<br/>
be the<br/>
		most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
		If you must know, I tought I had read it at the EQ/Station<br/>
site.  I went<br/>
		back to check but I was mistaken, I must have read it<br/>
somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
		&lt;.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in<br/>
the game&gt;<br/>
		Why?  When grouping with others it disrupts two of their<br/>
most often used<br/>
		spells?  I would think the opposite would be true.  Granted,<br/>
I can always<br/>
		get a SoW from someone in the group, but why let them waste<br/>
the mana when<br/>
		Selo&#39;s is faster (at least for me)?</div>
