<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434827888">In order to eliminate about half the number of keys/clicks bards need to do:<br/>
<br/>
Have the program changed so that when you click a song, it automatically<br/>
stops the one currently playing and starts the new one. The exceptions where<br/>
if it is the song currently being played - that stops it and if no song is<br/>
playing it starts it.  So now to twist/weave/play songs you could click:<br/>
<br/>
chain<br/>
fear<br/>
denons<br/>
chain<br/>
fear<br/>
denons<br/>
chain (chain stops by itself at end of its pulse like it does now)<br/>
<br/>
anthem<br/>
chords<br/>
anthem <br/>
chords<br/>
anthem<br/>
chords<br/>
chords (this second one to stop it)<br/>
<br/>
Would we lose anything this way?<br/>
<br/>
Sylly  - the bard~!<br/>
<br/>
p.s. so what if it makes Bard&#39;s the most powerful class in the game and<br/>
hundreds and hundreds of people start new bards and raise them to level 50<br/>
in 21 days played.<br/>
