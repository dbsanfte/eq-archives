The spear is actually quite difficult to beat in damage/speed<br/>
ratio.  I&#39;ve often wondered if, as your experience seems to<br/>
suggest, you need higher strength to fully take advantage of a<br/>
heavier/slower weapon.  That would make it so lower strength<br/>
characters would benefit more from lighter weapons.  OTOH, it<br/>
would also make it so higher strength characters would benefit<br/>
from lighter weapons, so if they coded that in there has to be<br/>
a counter to it.  I haven&#39;t been able to think up what that<br/>
counter might be.<br/>

&gt; yet I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll use a rapier when I dual wield.  (Part of my attraction<br/>
&gt; is that they look so damn cool, and I never see anyone using them.)  For now<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The graphic for the rapier looks cool, but it looks like a<br/>
damned dagger in your hand.  I stopped using them only for<br/>
that reason.<br/>

longsword.<br/>
