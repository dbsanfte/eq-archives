<div id="ygrps-yiv-999474198">Heh!  Considering how vocal I was on the original thread on the EQ boards (Me being vocal about some hot-button topic... imagine that :oP ), I&#39;m probably already banned ;o)<br/>

&gt;address something important.<br/>
&gt;Some of you may have heard already, but for those who didn&#39;t, a player on <br/>
&gt;Brell Serilis (my current home server) was banned for a roleplay story she <br/>
&gt;wrote and posted to a non-Sony affiliate board.  Please don&#39;t respond with <br/>
&gt;your &quot;they deserved it&quot; or &quot;Verant should be bombed!&quot; flames, I don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt;to start a thread about it.  If you&#39;re interested in the<br/>
&gt;Basically what I wanted to do, as co-moderator of this list, was to warn <br/>
&gt;you that anything you say can (and will, apparently) be held against you by <br/>
&gt;Verant.  This list is designed as a private list for subscriptions, etc, <br/>
&gt;but is open to the public for archive reading.  Consider this a word to the <br/>
&gt;wise.  I may even add this to the list FAQ :(<br/>
