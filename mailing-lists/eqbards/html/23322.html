<div id="ygrps-yiv-165848983">Pixie works pretty lousy.  There IS still a secondary resist.  My experience<br/>
in Sebelis is that it resists so much its worse than Charm as far as the<br/>
need for a heal.  At 52 with very good people my experience is still think<br/>
you need either a cleric or a shaman (slowing mobs) to do the crowd control<br/>
in Sebelis.  With an mediocre group you need a chanter.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot better luck in Karnor.  The mobs are low enough level difference<br/>
that the resistance is not as much an issue (at 52 - at 50 Pixie was<br/>
resisted a lot) I was able to keep mobs mezzed enough to stay in business.<br/>
However this was with a VERY good group - but we had a LOT of mobs.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well i wouldn&#39;t use charm in sebilis without a shaman or cleric, i would use<br/>
pixie<br/>
or twilight.  the shaman or cleric just opens up more opportunities for<br/>
flexibility.<br/>
note that you&#39;ve already backed down from the original statement which was<br/>
that<br/>
a cleric and enchanter are 100% required for any group post 50 (in a kunark<br/>
dungeon),<br/>
and that statement was the only thing i had a problem with.  i don&#39;t know<br/>
how well<br/>
pixie works, they fixed both songs after i had twilight and i always use<br/>
twilight instead.<br/>
