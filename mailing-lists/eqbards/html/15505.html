This is really exciting for me..<br/>
<br/>
Fennin Ro is splitting today/tomorrow.  The new server that many of us will<br/>
be migrating to should be up on Tuesday.  My guild is moving in its<br/>
entirity, although the migration list is strictly first-come-first-served.<br/>
There is no special treatment given to guilds, and in fact our guildtags<br/>
will not transfer.  Many players and guilds are staying on the old server<br/>
because of longstanding ties, and that&#39;s certainly understandable.<br/>
<br/>
This means that the server population will be made up largely of people that<br/>
are high level and complete newbies.  The middle level bracket is likely to<br/>
have some awesome grazing at places like Cazic-Thule, South Karana, Rathe<br/>
Mts, Lake Rathe, High Hold, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit leery of how all of this is going to work out, but I&#39;ll keep you<br/>
guys posted of any interesting developments.<br/>
