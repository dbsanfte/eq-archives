<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995854946">Speaking of Instruments, my guildmates got me a horn, but it&#39;s not really a<br/>
horn per se. It is bard only and a horn graphic but it is only range<br/>
equipable. It has a clickable slow and a load of awesome stats. I think it<br/>
dropped off something or other in VT. They logged me on to loot it so it<br/>
would not rot. They say it&#39;s effect doesn&#39;t stack with our slow song. I<br/>
haven&#39;t had a chance to test it yet. They also got the ancient mana song for<br/>
me. I have not had the time to play in the last couple weeks due to an<br/>
avalanche of RL stuff. Nothing bad, just loads of various crap that leaves<br/>
little time to play. I hope to get back in the swing when PoP comes out. <br/>
<br/>
Also if you haven&#39;t heard, another nifty bard/rogue item drops in Fungus<br/>
Grove. It&#39;s a cloak that goes in the ammo slot with a rightclick self invis.<br/>
This is off the named guy that spawns when you do the ring, which is a ton<br/>
of fun btw and doable with a group. Just pick the right speed for your group<br/>
size/capability.<br/>
