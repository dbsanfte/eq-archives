<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016633827">Greetings everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I hunted Giant Skeletons over the weekend near the entrance to Lake Rathe.<br/>
I was in a low 20&#39;s group of 4 and the xp was great.  Is there another area<br/>
besides the one at the entrance to LR that has the GSs?  We were having to<br/>
split the spawn with another group and could have handled a faster spawn<br/>
rate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
