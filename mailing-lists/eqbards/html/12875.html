&lt;&lt; Has anyone had any luck at all getting the /stopsong command to work?<br/>
 I was fighting in Unrest last night (note to self, never ever go there<br/>
 again!) and managed to get my song stuck a number of different times<br/>
 (sigh).  And of course my party is asking for the healing song in down<br/>
 time, and I would have loved to.  Except I&#39;m stuck playing binding and<br/>
 daren&#39;t move in case I bring the whole house down on us! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just start and stop the several quickly several times, this ALWAYS works.<br/>
