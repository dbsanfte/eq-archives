<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487349978">This is the other case of the twink that bothers me. I have only met one <br/>
person with a bought account that I liked and trusted, and that&#39;s because he <br/>
came into it knowing the game. Most of these ppl buy these high level <br/>
accounts, but have no clue what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you are camping the something in guk, some lvl 50 asks to join the <br/>
group, but doesn&#39;t know how to get to dead tower??? I&#39;ve gotten killed by <br/>
these lvl 50 newbies a few times and refuse to group with them ever again.<br/>

&gt;I have a similar problem, but not directly related to twinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started playing EQ with a friend of mine, and since he had much more free<br/>
&gt;time to spend on his chars, he was able to advance far ahead of me with a<br/>
&gt;number of characters, but usually he would have one that he was working on<br/>
&gt;that was near my level so we would hang out and adventure together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Recently I turned another friend of mine on to the game, someone who had<br/>
&gt;been very addicted to UO and did not think EQ was going to be that much <br/>
&gt;fun.<br/>
&gt;He started a character and was moving up the levels pretty quick, but then<br/>
&gt;at about level 15 he decided that the whole process was taking to long, so<br/>
&gt;he bought an account from E-Bay with a 50th level character and a couple of<br/>
&gt;20-30 levels characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At first this really did not bug me too much, and while I tended to look<br/>
&gt;down in general who bought accounts from E-Bay, I cut him some slack. But<br/>
&gt;now it is really starting to cause some bad feelings, mainly because he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;off adventuring in the planes Guk, Sol B, etc. and I am still looking at<br/>
&gt;another 3-4 months at my pace of play to even get into the 40&#39;s where I<br/>
&gt;might be able to try those places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It really make me wonder what I am putting all this work into. While for <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up with the world&#39;s<br/>
&gt;most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to think about hanging<br/>
&gt;the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know this is not something any one of us can change or fix, but I thought<br/>
&gt;I would put it out there to see if anyone else had a similar experience.<br/>
