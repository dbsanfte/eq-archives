<div id="ygrps-yiv-60626916">Now, I am normally not an optimist or anything close, but here&#39;s a<br/>
thought...<br/>
<br/>
Absor doesn&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on with the bug (a given).  There<br/>
is a similar, though much lesser, version on the live servers, which we<br/>
know as our good old stuck song bug.  Perhaps, and I must admit I am<br/>
fairly skeptical, but *perhaps* the situation on test has to do with<br/>
finally finding a way to test the stuck song bug?  Ester swore it would<br/>
be worked on as soon as they could reproduce it in-house...maybe this is<br/>
how they&#39;ve finally managed to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you&#39;d have to take that possibility with a grain of salt the<br/>
size of Everest with what we know about Verant, but wouldn&#39;t it be nice?<br/>
