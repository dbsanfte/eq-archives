<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817434089">The reason for the charges is quite possible, but your final statement is flawed, &quot;..if no one charged, everyone would have a lot more money.&quot;  It&#39;s the same amount of money--different hands.  This economics is built into EQ.  Ever see a PC merchant just giving stuff away?  No, he sells wares to make money, as some decide to provide services for money.  Think of it the same way that McDonald&#39;s sells food (something tangible and physical) to Federal Express (a service, you are basically paying them to do something quickly that would be impossible or too time consuming to do yourself.)  People get their binds and corpse finds for free from their friends and acquantances anyway, so if someone wants to charge for a corpse find or a bind, hooray for them.  If the person doesn&#39;t want their services, they will find someone else to do it for them either cheaper or for free--same with any business.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t believe in requesting any type of pay. I don&#39;t even accept<br/>
&gt; donations(personal beliefs), though I have no problem with other people<br/>
&gt; asking for donations. Why? Have you ever needed to be bound to a place?<br/>
&gt; How much do most spellcasters charge for it, 5gp. Ever spellcaster that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve met who charges has said they only do it because other mages do,<br/>
&gt; and because necros and bards charge for finding corpses. Personally I<br/>
&gt; believe if nobody charged everyone would have a lot more money.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ahem..<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels rounded<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.  This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>
&gt; &gt; this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10?<br/>
