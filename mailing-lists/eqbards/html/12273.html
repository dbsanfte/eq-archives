<div id="ygrps-yiv-976016406">Hello fellow bards.  I have finally, finally advanced out of level 45 hell.  Hurrah!<br/>
 Of course I have no sense and the very next morning I went on a Vox raid and she<br/>
kindly took it from me.  Twice.  Ouch.  Ah well, it would have been worth it but<br/>
alas no horn =(.  Still, the Seafury Cyclops eventually yielded the re-ding.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I used the knowledge I gained here about good strategies for Nagafen and<br/>
Vox to prepare my song list.  Nagafen was last week, and yes he thought bard tasted<br/>
really good too.  Lost the drum lotto on that one *pout*.<br/>
<br/>
I have 46 to get through before I attempt the Planes - I want that margin! - but<br/>
that will be soon I hope.  I have read a few posts on the topic of Plane strategies,<br/>
but am eager for more.  Help me out please?<br/>
