<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388766586"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;that&#39;s the whole point.  if we could lullaby and do other stuff, we&#39;d have<br/>

I could not disagree more.  Being able to twist one song and Lullaby or<br/>
being able to use weapons and Lullaby would not make us anywhere near as<br/>
good at crowd control as Enchanters.  Our mobs would get a chance to resist<br/>
mez every six seconds in option 2 or every 12 seconds in option 1.<br/>
Enchanters can mez things for nearly a minute in one cast.  Also AoE mez is<br/>
only a 16th level Enchanter spell, so us getting Lullaby at 15th hardly<br/>
qualifies it as much lower level.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t make a sandwich before a full group kills a mob.  In fact I&#39;d have<br/>
trouble making it upstairs and back down to the computer with a soda before<br/>
it would be time to switch mobs.<br/>
