&gt;So long as they are only laying claim to one class&#39; loot, I see no<br/>
&gt;problem switching the two.  Now, if their secondary has the same class as<br/>
&gt;another member of the group, the actual member should obviously have<br/>
&gt;priority in that class&#39; drops.  Then again, my luck has only ever had one<br/>
&gt;piece of bard-only loot drop in a group I have been in, so I have never<br/>
&gt;had the chance to be robbed :)<br/>
