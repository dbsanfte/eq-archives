&gt;Venril did no disease/posion dots. Just melee and that lifetap from what i<br/>

&gt;&gt; If it&#39;s lifetap you need to have the bards sing &quot;Purifying Rhytms&quot; I would<br/>
&gt;&gt; also throw in Hymn and Nivs and the 50+ healing song as well.  That should<br/>
&gt;&gt; help to counter the lifetap nicely.  Alternately sing Purifying Rhythms,<br/>
&gt;FCC<br/>
&gt;&gt; and TCF.  Also any poison resist spells your clerics/shaman/druids can<br/>
&gt;cast<br/>
&gt;&gt; on you.  Lifetap is a Poison Resist Check.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Maestro of Rancor uses a Lifetap type spell that does nearly as much dmg<br/>
&gt;&gt; which is area affect and using poison resistance gear/songs/spells people<br/>
&gt;&gt; can usually take him down without too much trouble.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Good luck!<br/>
