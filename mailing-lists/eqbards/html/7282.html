Maybe if you have it up when you get rooted, you can&#39;t break it with accel,<br/>
but if you aren&#39;t singing it when you&#39;re rooted, it will break it.  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be too far fetched considering the weirdness involved with these<br/>
interactions we&#39;ve seen in the past.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;Is it possible they fully fleshed this out and made it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;level-dependent whether or not Accel breaks root?  The code is<br/>

&gt;&gt; I repeat, I was in HHpass and I am level 23 and a green Soothesayer rooted<br/>
&gt;&gt; me solid, and it held for at least 20 secs.<br/>

&gt;Maybe some mobs can always root you?  There are some mobs that<br/>
&gt;can always see invisible.  Just throwing out suggestions that<br/>
&gt;may fit the data.<br/>
