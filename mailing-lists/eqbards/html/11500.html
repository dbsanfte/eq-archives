&gt; A lot of you have noticed that you get resist after resist with Pixie <br/>
&gt; Strike, until it &quot;takes&quot; - then it suddenly works over and over (ditto with <br/>
&gt; Charm?)  Weeeeeelll - apparently, an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; of those two <br/>
&gt; songs is a slight magic resistance debuff.<br/>

myself.  Will have to test it again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  Can I gloat?  Told you so?  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not surprising considering cancel magic has no effect on<br/>
disease and poison.  Now if Verant would only fix it so<br/>
poison/disease DOTs were really poison or disease based,<br/>
instead of magic based...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Denon&#39;s Dissension is a mana-debuff, but since NPC&#39;s don&#39;t USE mana, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; utterly useless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They do use mana, but unless the fight drags on for about 2-3<br/>
minutes (i.e. death against a blue+ caster), they essentially<br/>
have unlimited mana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame/Frost supplements it&#39;s weak damage by adding a <br/>
&gt; Fire/Cold resistance debuff (So theoretically, they&#39;ll take more damage if <br/>
&gt; they resist less?  Stick with Denon&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re in a caster-heavy group and they&#39;re concentrating on<br/>
one type of spell (fire or cold), then it can be useful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chord&#39;s of Cessation adds a damage effect to it&#39;s slow-down, however, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; slow-down is no more powerful than the Chains.  If anything, it&#39;s worse <br/>
&gt; than chains, because while they both slow down attacks, only chains slows <br/>
&gt; movement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not if it doesn&#39;t cancel snare.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All information comes from the spdat.eff and/or spells.eff files, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bear in mind these are client-side spell effects.  Verant can<br/>
tweak these server-side without changing the client-side<br/>
listings.  It&#39;ll cause a few seconds of unsynchronization, but<br/>
the server will win.<br/>
