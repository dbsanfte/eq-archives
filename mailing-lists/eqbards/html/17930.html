<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039906105">Even more evidence that Verant doesn&#39;t practice quality assurance when it<br/>
comes to testing.  You would think that this is something that would have<br/>
gotten easily caught had they checked it.  I mean the whole purpose of<br/>
adding the song was to raise the level cap for charm.  After testing it<br/>
against a level 38+ mob to see if it worked, the next mob I would have<br/>
tested it against is one I knew it wasn&#39;t supposed to work on (hmmm perhaps<br/>
a god would be a good choice).  <br/>

Hot off the www.eqvault.com presses:  I guess we can&#39;t complain as long as<br/>
it&#39;s a REASONABLE Cap!<br/>

  Today&#39;s patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including some<br/>
new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that was put<br/>
in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped. Someone was kind<br/>
enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a *really nice* pet named<br/>
Cazic-Thule.<br/>
