<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142022824"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;From a reliable source.. Guides do not get *any* of their<br/>
&gt; &gt;class&#39;s spells or songs. They also do not get any<br/>
&gt; &gt;instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>
&gt; &gt;to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>
&gt; &gt;another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>
&gt; &gt;saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well this is wrong from first hand experiance. After the <br/>
&gt; first zone crash in the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!)<br/>
&gt; we had a guide helping us by ressurecting and recovering<br/>
&gt; our corpses for us. He would summon us to our corpse in<br/>
&gt; the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this <br/>
&gt; was damn odd, because he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and<br/>
&gt; was using his lvl 49 spell to do this. And he had to<br/>
&gt; meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>
&gt; before by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped<br/>
&gt; away. Maybe this was just a freak occurance, i dont know,<br/>
&gt; but he definately had his spells :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Check out the &quot;leaked&quot; policies and procedures manual<br/>
that came out awhile ago. All guides use a cape of<br/>
vashar or some like name to do resurrections. They do<br/>
not use spells. Granted, the cape may take mana for<br/>
whatever reason, but it&#39;s not a spell they&#39;re casting<br/>
from their spellbook. GM&#39;s on the other hand may be<br/>
able to do things differently since they&#39;re not as<br/>
limited as guides are in that they&#39;re actually employed<br/>
by Verant and &#39;trusted&#39; so to speak with extra tools.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the p&p as they call it is a very good thing<br/>
that all players should read in my opinion. It tells <br/>
you exactly what guides can and can&#39;t do and why. I<br/>
know I&#39;ve started looking at guides differently since<br/>
I read it and know when not to bother them with something<br/>
I know they aren&#39;t going to be able to fix because of<br/>
their guidelines. It also gives a nifty look at the<br/>
tools they get to use to do their duties.</div>
