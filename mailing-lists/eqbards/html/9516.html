I couldn&#39;t agree with you more Kitasi.  It&#39;s pure greed, plain and simple.<br/>
This always happens in games of this nature : High level players abusing<br/>
their powers.  I wish there were effective and sensible ways of keeping<br/>
certain level ranges away from each other.  Like an island for characters 1<br/>
- 15, then a two hour boat ride to the next island (16 - 30), etc, etc.  It<br/>
would definitely go a long way to restoring some sense of balance to the<br/>
economy and keep incidents like Kitasi described from happening (but it<br/>
would probably create a whole new slew of problems as well).<br/>
