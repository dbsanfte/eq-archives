 </span></blockquote>At level 16 I&#39;ve been power levelling a now level 12 warrior while <br/>
allowing him to get weapon increases.  In fact, I think his weapon <br/>
skills have improved more since I started helping than before.  <br/>
<br/>
We start off each battle grouped.  With mandolin in hand, I twist <br/>
Anthem D&#39;Arms, Jig O&#39; Vigor, and Hymn of Restoration.  I do not do<br/>
any <br/>
damage to the mob myself.  Once the mob is around 1/4 health, I <br/>
disband and throw in a couple of bellows just to speed up its demise. <br/>
 Once the battle has been won, I target the warrior, invite him to <br/>
group, fire up Selo&#39;s or the hymn, depending on his health, and off<br/>
we <br/>
go to the next mob.  The warrior get&#39;s all the experience and is <br/>
usually at full health at the end of each battle.  Lately we&#39;ve been <br/>
playing ring around the skellies near the mino caves in Steamfont, <br/>
with a minotaur slaver pull in between each round of skellies.  And I <br/>
originally thought I&#39;d have to wait for charm to become an effective <br/>
power leveller...<br/>
