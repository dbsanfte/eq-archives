<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003817785">If you fight in CT without a cleric, you will find out soon enough!  On the<br/>
other hand, if you fight there with one in your party, by the time you have<br/>
your songs re-memmed, you should be getting the &quot;...wants to resurrect<br/>
you...&quot; yes/no box.<br/>

Bard of the 37th song<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. yes 37 now!  woo hoo!  Dinged into 37 stabbing and crushing the Oger<br/>
Guards right inside their very own (outdoor) city zone.  And now that I have<br/>
been there some hours, I will stir up that old bixie nest about binding<br/>
there for &#39;goodie&#39; races.  I&#39;d have no problems being binded there and<br/>
re-spawning nekkid.  Now that I have seen the place and know there is ample<br/>
room to be binded out of sight of any patrolling inside guards.  The outer<br/>
guards seem to be camped 24x7.  On the odd times that they are not, you<br/>
could either selo&#39;s past them or even try to sneak.  If you are really<br/>
worried, you could beg an oger/troll/power leveling pallidin for a flute -<br/>
common drop off the newb lizzies.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. nobody ever discusses why it is bad to kill oger guards.  first off,<br/>
the goodies that do it want the xp.  second off, the newb ogers who lose the<br/>
protection of their guards want the loot.  what loot? well, (sorry john, I<br/>
think I found the &#39;big secret good loot - good xp&#39; you were not gonna tell<br/>
us about) oger guards drop long swords that sell for 10 to 12pp, gems 2-4pp,<br/>
2-??pp in coin, round shields, & crude steins.  The master looter usually<br/>
leaves the shields and steins.  The newb&#39;s will nab em when the corpse lets<br/>
them.  If our War&#39;s succeed in their disarms (&quot;Arrrgh, my weapon!&quot;), the<br/>
newbs will even snatch them up before we can.  third off, the evils that<br/>
kill them want the xp to replace what they lost in the Planes raids.  I made<br/>
an off-hand remark to a lev 50 wiz who was killing them&quot; &quot;... he would kill<br/>
his grandmother if she conned blue or better to him...&quot; and he said: &quot;That&#39;s<br/>
right!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
		&gt;Crier, one question I have, because a couple of my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guildmates are in CZ and<br/>
		keep bugging me to &quot;Come on Down !&quot;-Do you get bound in<br/>
Freeport or Arena? I<br/>
		am definately sick of High Keep- and saw my Rogue guild mate<br/>
shoot from<br/>
		32-38 in like 2 weeks I think.<br/>
		And how long does it take you to do the corpse run if you<br/>
are in Freeport?<br/>
