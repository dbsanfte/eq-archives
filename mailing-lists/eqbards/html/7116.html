&gt;I don&#39;t remember seeing this posted before so sending it in. On Allakazam&#39;s<br/>
&gt;site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">http://everquest.gamestats.com/</a>  , there is updated info on the Lute<br/>
&gt;of the Gypsy Princess.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt; Lute of the Gypsy Princess: Healing sone does double healing every<br/>
&gt;other heal. (May only work for higher level bards) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps this was implemented in one of the two recent patches?  If its true,<br/>
&gt;the next question is what level do you need to be to get the bonus.<br/>

<br/>
On a side note, I tested the test server test features ;)  I like &#39;em.  The<br/>
no-drop into the bank is incredibly helpful, and the rearrangeable<br/>
spellbook (didn&#39;t I just say that couldn&#39;t be done?! ) works like a charm.<br/>
FYI, ya gotta right click to rearrange.<br/>
PLEASE let them put all this stuff through ;)<br/>
