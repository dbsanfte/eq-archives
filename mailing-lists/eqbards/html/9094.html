<b>Subject:</b> Level 43 song - Desperate Dirge <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172255578">I am just about to recieve my level 43 song (Desperate<br/>
Dirge) and had a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) Can this song still damage the singer?  or has this<br/>
been fixed?<br/>
<br/>
2) Is the song a true area effect?  or do you need to<br/>
target a single critter?  or can you target yourself<br/>
to get AoE around you?<br/>
<br/>
3) How many critters can the song affect?  what type<br/>
of damage is typical?<br/>
<br/>
4) Is this song resisted more, less, the same as other<br/>
songs?<br/>
<br/>
Along with these questions please add anything else<br/>
you would like to say about the song.  I usually test<br/>
out the songs myself, but seeing how it has such a<br/>
LONG reload time that may prove to be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
