<div id="ygrps-yiv-541023176">The Xegony GM&#39;s were quite thick-skinned.  The wounded elf was killed - but<br/>
kept up his script lying on the ground dead.  They zapped all trains<br/>
(although I&#39;m not certain they were done intentionally).  They ignored<br/>
stupid remarks about Myong&#39;s bad spelling and typing and in general just<br/>
kept plugging away despite the chaos around them.<br/>
<br/>
Verant needs to put code in to make these things better.  How about Maxwell<br/>
Smart&#39;s &quot;Cone of Silence&quot;?<br/>
