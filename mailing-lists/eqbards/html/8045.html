<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927297238">Or for to make it Bard related...bards have three races to chose from, two of<br/>
which will not give females much clothing.  This is an important issue to you<br/>
sister-bards, be supportive or delete the thread.<br/>
<br/>
Last night after I was killed by a Sand Giant & the party scattered in the Oasis,<br/>
a male wood druid who lived & I were the first to make it back to where we were<br/>
camped.  He make the usual naked helf/ drool emote so I turn to face him as he<br/>
was dressed & could stand guard. I start to loot my body, but I guess he wasn&#39;t<br/>
watching for SG&#39;s because he does the standard &quot;MM behind you&quot; warning, but as my<br/>
slow computer won&#39;t let me out of the window, I don&#39;t see the ....hits you....<br/>
messages I am expecting.  No Madman, I was just facing so he couldn&#39;t see my butt<br/>
& he wanted me to turn around in panic.  It is enough of a problem, that my<br/>
1/2ling niece was started yelling a guys to leave me alone, that her uncle<br/>
wouldn&#39;t like it, after they didn&#39;t get the hint when I tell them I&#39;m happily<br/>
married.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; and, to make this bard related... I think the bard class and the cleric<br/>
&gt; class appeal most to females because of their cooperative roles and their<br/>
&gt; ability to make others around them stronger... agree?  disagree? </span></blockquote></div>
