<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-684337923">I just read on the EQVault main page Brad&#39;s recent post on the official<br/>
Gameplay forum.  He talks mainly about the lifespan of EQ.  At the very end<br/>
of the post is the following comment:<br/>
<br/>
(I didn&#39;t realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we<br/>
complain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied<br/>
it, but I think &quot;They doth protest too much&quot; to paraphrase &quot;THE BARD&quot;) <br/>
Agreed. <br/>
Thanks very much for your comments. <br/>

I haven&#39;t had the time to read the Gameplay forum to get the full context of<br/>
the thread but the way I interpret it someone posted that bards protest too<br/>
much and that Brad agreed.  Am I misinterpreting this or has our class now<br/>
gained the reputation at Verant as a whining class?  If the original poster<br/>
was referring to John Kim&#39;s post concerning lullaby I don&#39;t see how that can<br/>
be interpreted as a protest.<br/>
Of course, the quote &quot;Thou doth protest too much&quot; could be a reference to<br/>
William Shakespeare, which my Alabama high school education did not give me<br/>
too much exposure to:-)<br/>
