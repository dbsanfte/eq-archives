&gt; &gt;I made 17th level last night and I have a question. How many, if any,<br/>
extra<br/>
&gt; &gt;training points should I put into Dual Wield? I am using a combine<br/>
&gt; longsword<br/>
&gt; &gt;as my primary weapon and I have a choice of either a combine scimitar or<br/>
&gt; &gt;magic whip, with lifetap I forget its name. Which should I use in the off<br/>
&gt; &gt;hand. I have been trying to get a PGT but haven&#39;t yet. I did get the<br/>
&gt; Cracked<br/>
&gt; &gt;Darkwood shield.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I *think* I put about a lot of training points into Dual Weild, not doing<br/>
&gt; trades I I didn&#39;t have much else to use them on and Dual Weild is a huge<br/>
&gt; event after all that wimpy thrashing around, so I wanted to be up to speed<br/>
&gt; as soon as possible. THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>
&gt; fall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>
&gt; You want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; hand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>
&gt; using a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>
&gt; (and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24.<br/>
Even<br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; you stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; tenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Povar<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, either things have changed since I played last (went to AC for<br/>
a couple of months, then just didn&#39;t play anything for a bit) or ....<br/>
<br/>
dual wield checks when the delay on your off hand is up.  To speed<br/>
it going up, put a dagger in it (you won&#39;t be missing out on damage<br/>
early on) to give it the most chances to check.<br/>
<br/>
You should only have to put one point in, then it will max before you<br/>
make 18<br/>
<br/>
On a side note ....<br/>
Do you know what it&#39;s like to discover you&#39;ve left a late teens bard<br/>
at the bottom of paw when you log back in?  I left him there *BEFORE*<br/>
paw changed ............. YIKES!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
SIGH<br/>
<br/>
I just started playing again on Saturday, after a long layoff, is there<br/>
anywhere that archives the patch messages? </span></blockquote></div>
