<div id="ygrps-yiv-431835820">Greetings all!<br/>
I am known as Fflewdeur on the Cazic-Thule server.  I signed on to the list <br/>
a few days ago and I&#39;ve read many interesting topics.  I decided to respond <br/>
to this one with my introduction though.d<br/>
<br/>
Should Bards specialize?  There are good points brought up to support this.  <br/>
However, I believe that the Bard class is intended to be able to fill <br/>
multiple roles in a party.  Bards are not supposed to specialize.  Our role <br/>
is to enhance parties&#39; effectivness, be that as a tank in some situations or <br/>
as a minstrel in others.  We are unique in that we can change roles to fit a <br/>
party.  Bards are truly underrated in my opinion.  The Bard can stay in one <br/>
party while others come and go, and the party won&#39;t fall apart!  We are the <br/>
focal point even though others in the party don&#39;t realize it.  For example:  <br/>
I played for 10 hours one day and had party members come and go.  Because of <br/>
the different roles a Bard can fulfill the party was strong whether we had 4 <br/>
tanks and an enchanter (and me) or if we had one tank (me) and 3 clerics and <br/>
two magicians.  The fighting style was obviously different, but it is my <br/>
thought that because of the diversity of a Bard, we can hold parties <br/>
together that might otherwise be unbalanced.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested to see where this thought goes eventually.  Perhaps there <br/>
may be a specialization for 50+ level Bards, but how to choose?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think I would like to trade my diversity to specialize.  In fact, that is <br/>
one of my chief reasons for choosing the Bard class in the first place.<br/>

&gt;I still find it hard to believe that a bard will ever make a better tank<br/>
&gt;than a warrior, rogue, or ranger. Perhaps with enough plate armor and <br/>
&gt;buffs,<br/>
&gt;you might be equal to them but the best one? ehh, maybe (haven&#39;t seen it<br/>
&gt;yet) but I will try to keep an open mind ;]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will emphasize that a bard MUST be in a forceful (and I mean full party <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;strong fighters) to simply play instruments. If the party has only 3<br/>
&gt;members, a lot of casters, it is important to whip out the weapons and<br/>
&gt;fight. However if you have rogues backstabbing and warriors taunting ,<br/>
&gt;rangers, monks . . . . basically a coordinated group somewhat evenly taking<br/>
&gt;damage, I stand strong in my position that a lute healing 60 points (10<br/>
&gt;points per group member) of damage per pulse (and remember this will<br/>
&gt;increase in levels) is quite helpful and an efficient battle tactic (I have<br/>
&gt;TONS of personal examples).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However the topic makes me ask, do you think EQ should allow bards to<br/>
&gt;specialize? For example Mr Tank Bard gets to have a better attack skill<br/>
&gt;where Ms Luteplaying Bard gets a better string skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I for some reason have this strange image of a 250+pd tank who is <br/>
&gt;constantly<br/>
&gt;getting knocked in the head, his fingers broken, with a lot of burly muscle<br/>
&gt;around his neck decked out in plate being a tad bit weaker in the musical<br/>
&gt;talent. Whereas the little fragile bard who does nothing but play songs and<br/>
&gt;try to avoid being hit, could just play masterpieces but fight wimpier?  To<br/>
&gt;the best of my knowledge it is &quot;fairly easy&quot; to max out your skills in<br/>
&gt;instruments and attack, no matter what your play style. I DON&#39;T want to <br/>
&gt;TAKE<br/>
&gt;AWAY the BARD&#39;s SKILLS. I just think that specialization might allow one to<br/>
&gt;roleplay and create the type of bard they want to be, therefore making a<br/>
&gt;more rewarding game experience. Possibly the specialization could come out<br/>
&gt;in a year or so with the expansion pack when the bard is already 50th <br/>
&gt;level,<br/>
&gt;something to look forward to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just a thought, yea or nay comments welcome 8) </span></blockquote></div>
