<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191365892">I have to put in my 2 cp here on twinking. I am twinked, fairly well but not <br/>
the worst by far. Saw a L11 in misty last wek wearing steel and Mithril. My <br/>
friends and I have also found various rubicited low level bodies about <br/>
Norrath so equipment is clearly not everything. Xegony is developing a fair <br/>
number of twinks, mainly I believe due to a large number of maxed players <br/>
who now are experimentin with new classes. As one of my guildmembers put it, <br/>
be happy for them, they did earn that stuff at some point and having down <br/>
the nwbie trip once why should we begrudge them? Far worse IMHO are the <br/>
max&#39;ed chars that are sold to someone else!<br/>
Also, many of us on Xegony were in the beta and we started over many times, <br/>
new chars, new races, new classes. We know newbiedom so well! So yes we <br/>
cooperated and gave ourselves legs up as the ones who had time to max out in <br/>
2 months passed down their older equipment as they got better. A good guild <br/>
can really hlp you make connections as well as new friends. We have been <br/>
newbies plenty and now want to get higher. Besides, if a L40+ wants to give <br/>
you something, take it! They are trying to be nice and alot of them have <br/>
stuff stocked back they can&#39;t even use. With no money drains on them, they <br/>
can afford to be generous and it makes them feel good about helping others.<br/>
One thing I think also about twinking and relates to the real problem of <br/>
camping, if I have better stuff now I do not have to camp for it and add to <br/>
the general camping problem. It also frees me to help my friends get things <br/>
they need without squabbling about loot. when our melee friends want BBCs <br/>
and BIBs they know I am glad to come help, since I am not tied down camping <br/>
something to help me.<br/>
And lastly, sold one of the ashenwood spears to a friend last night for <br/>
50pp. That was what he could afford to give me for it, and I had stored it <br/>
when it came in from on of my husband&#39;s (L48) adventures. I did not use it <br/>
since it will not equip secondary and I was not giving up my thulian claw. <br/>
So I sold it to this friend and he is a very happy ranger indeed!<br/>
The final insult: I was asked last night why I was not higher level with <br/>
such good equipment, by a person in a zone we had just left. At the time, we <br/>
were wiping out a ghoul camp in North Karanas so a poor traveler could get <br/>
his body back. He had run into the camp unknowing and been killed. We gave <br/>
the guy all the loot from 6 ghouls, 3 mummies, and 4 skels by the time we <br/>
got clear of the camp and subsequent respawns. He was quite shocked and left <br/>
without looting them all, so we finished looting fast so he got splits <br/>
before he could disband from us!<br/>
And of course I am talking about saving for steel plate but can&#39;t overcome <br/>
my penchant for giving things and helping people!<br/>
<br/>
