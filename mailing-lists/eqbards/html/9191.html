<div id="ygrps-yiv-779766124">OH YEAH!!!  I died two straight weeks figuring this out... hehehe<br/>
<br/>
But the dumbest death has to be when I was speed songing a dwarf freind of<br/>
mine to Kaladim.  He was about 10 lvls higher than me, and I was 19lvl at<br/>
the time with about 350hp.  Well, he decides to take a short cut over the<br/>
mountains and I follow.  We crest this mountain not far from the gates, and<br/>
I start taking damage, before I can figure out what happened, I was zoned<br/>
back to Kelethin.  The first fall did 70 points of damage, the second did<br/>
150+ damage, the third did 300+ damage! I went from full health to flat line<br/>
is a heart beat.  The visual here is me being propelled off the mountain<br/>
top, my legs pumping away in the air at super speed as I casade down to my<br/>
death.  I dont think safefall woulda help me here! :)<br/>

&gt; Just thought I&#39;d share this little tid-bit of idiocy with y&#39;all....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just yesterday, I finally decided to go get my Lambent Bracer (my first<br/>
&gt; lambent piece). I contacted my druid friend and had him gate me to<br/>
&gt; lavastorm.  I entered the temple and made my way to the two quest NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (forget their names).  I was checking and re-checking, to make sure I had<br/>
&gt; the correct components/cash.  I was asking about all the Lambent pieces -<br/>
&gt; insuring that my list was still up-to-date.  As soon as I typed the &#39;a&#39; in<br/>
&gt; lambent, I started attacking the female NPC.  I made a futile attempt to<br/>
&gt; flee, but I made it no further than 10 paces before I became worm food.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My friend asks : &quot;What are you doing in Greater faydark?&quot;<br/>
&gt; I respond : &quot;You won&#39;t believe what I just did...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Needless to say, that was about the single dumbest thing I&#39;ve done in this<br/>
&gt; game yet.  Since I was feeling pretty bad about myself (I must admit it<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; pretty hilarious though) I wanted to see if any of you fine bards had<br/>
&gt; boneheaded experiences of your own to share.<br/>
