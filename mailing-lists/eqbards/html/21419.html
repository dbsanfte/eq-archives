<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227430835">I originally thought that as well, that it was just that &quot;I&quot; was having<br/>
trouble getting into groups and not my bard.  Then I did an experiment with<br/>
my original bard on Sol Ro.  I walked around several zones asking some<br/>
groups if I could join.  7 out of eleven said they weren&#39;t interested for<br/>
various reasons, I was too high a level, I was too low a level, they didn&#39;t<br/>
really need another member, etc.  I then ran around the same groups with my<br/>
enchanter and every single one had room for me.  My enchanter was the exact<br/>
same level at the time as my bard.  Two of the groups reasoning seemed<br/>
somewhat logical, but for 4 of them it was patently obvious they had no<br/>
interest in a bard.  I had my friend try with his warrior who was one level<br/>
higher and he only got refused by 2 groups.  There are definitely some<br/>
people who will only group with a character they think will make them able<br/>
to get more xp/loot/etc.<br/>

&gt;If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>
&gt;every group should love to have one.<br/>
&gt;But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>

problems finding<br/>
a group with my bard.  maybe you need to make some friends.<br/>
