Last night I was in Unrest and a mini-train was taking my party apart.  We<br/>
called &quot;run&quot; so I hit selo&#39;s and broke for the zone when I got down to a<br/>
single bubble.  I was doing ok, but I was having to stop and go trying to<br/>
keep<br/>
everyone in Selo&#39;s range.  It&#39;s a long way from the back yard to the zone<br/>
(plus I was a couple of pounds encumbered - stupid) and I wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
make<br/>
it.  I got rooted by a Ghoul near the fountains in the front yard and<br/>
proceeded to die.  I stopped Selo&#39;s and fired it back up to break the root<br/>
and<br/>
about that time I hit the ground unconcious.  Just then a Paladin laid hands<br/>
on me - while on the ground unconcious.  I popped back up with almost full<br/>
health and broke for the zone amazed.  I made it out with the majority of my<br/>
group that time.  This Paladin wasn&#39;t in our group, he was just some 25th<br/>
level dude that was watching the train go by and saw me fall.  I scrolled<br/>
back<br/>
trying to see who&#39;d Laid On Hands but the name didn&#39;t appear.  So I started<br/>
/telling around asking people until I found him and I thanked him profusely.<br/>
He only gets to do this once per game day, so it was pretty gratious of him.<br/>

&gt; I had a disturbing situation happen the other day.  I was sharing the<br/>
&gt; sisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>
&gt; other players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>
&gt; Bard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; soloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; thing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something<br/>
odd<br/>
&gt; happend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; figured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between<br/>
spawns<br/>
&gt; as I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>
&gt; the 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>
&gt; My jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>
&gt; all and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>
&gt; deciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I knew that they would die if they stayed, but I thought that the 16th<br/>
bard<br/>
&gt; would kick in Selo&#39;s and run for the zone pulling the little nasty with<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; and saving the party.  Thats what I would do.  Well I waited and the spell<br/>
&gt; caster managed to get off some big spells taking its health down about a<br/>
&gt; quarter, just as the Bard and the Ranger dropped.  By this time I had my<br/>
&gt; drum in hand and Selo&#39;s playing, I whacked the Brownie and headed for the<br/>
&gt; Greater Fay zone.  Much to my surprise, I could not out-run him by much,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he stayed on my tail all the way to the zone, where I got out with a<br/>
sliver<br/>
&gt; of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m feeling pretty good at this point, because I managed to save the<br/>
&gt; Spell Caster.  But as I&#39;m healing in the entrance to the lesser fay, the<br/>
&gt; Bard who died came up and started bitching me out for not helping.  I told<br/>
&gt; him that he was dead from the first hit, and asked him why he did not Selo<br/>
&gt; out for the zone with his party, but that just made him more mad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; better, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>
