so I have a question - is it impossible to do a Dragon or Plane raid <br/>
with members from multiple guilds? Granted the ability to use guild <br/>
chat makes communication easier (although once in the plane - isn&#39;t <br/>
Shout the equivalent)? People use shout in Sol B all the time for <br/>
Fire Giant Raids. I can understand the concern for having people you <br/>
trust to know how to play their chars and not &quot;ninja-loot&quot;. But <br/>
unless I&#39;m missing something - this concept is what causes people in <br/>
smaller guilds to complain of &quot;uber-guilds&quot; and &quot;Character Stealing&quot;. <br/>
Is it TRULY necessary to have a single guild complete these events?<br/>
<br/>
imho, it comes down to organization.  My gf and I had gone 40 some <br/>
odd levels without joining a guild... nor had we wanted to join one.  <br/>
I led a guild in another world (Meridian 59) and I wanted to <br/>
completely avoid any politics this time around.  As we got higher in <br/>
levels, looking ahead to the things we&#39;d be doing, it seemed <br/>
basically impossible to get involved on a consistent basis in Dragon <br/>
Raids, Plane Runs, and now many of the new ROK dungeons.  We went <br/>
along on a Phin raid in Kedge prior to joining a guild, but <br/>
opportunities were few and far between.  I talked with a few of my <br/>
guilded friends and it basically worked like this:<br/>
<br/>
Player A wants to organize a raid.  He needs 18 - 24 people to do <br/>
it.  He first looks within his own guild to gather people.  If he <br/>
can&#39;t find enough, he&#39;ll invite people from allied guilds.  If still <br/>
there is not enough they&#39;ll take stragglers.  Certainly having a <br/>
friend within one of the guilds going makes it easier, but if there&#39;s <br/>
only 2 spots open and 9 people have non-guilded friends.... you get <br/>
the picture.  Now this is only how it worked with that guild in <br/>
particular.. I have no clue how other guilds work, but I suspect it&#39;s <br/>
close.<br/>
<br/>
Now, why would they organize it like this?  Getting 18-24 people <br/>
together to do something of this nature (where everyone has to be <br/>
working together, knowing their role) when you&#39;re not guilded is <br/>
basically impossible.  Who do you start inquiring of?  Getting the <br/>
word out, setting times to do the raid, and confirming people coming <br/>
are large tasks.  If 4 people don&#39;t show in a guild raid there&#39;s more <br/>
to draw on... if 4 people don&#39;t show on a straggler type raid, it&#39;s <br/>
much more difficult to fill those spots.  Also, there&#39;s a level of <br/>
trust.  Everyone must be working together to get these things done.  <br/>
Organizing and making sure this happens on an unguilded level is <br/>
another monumental task.  When it&#39;s the same basic people doing the <br/>
raids over and over again, you start to know who to trust and what to <br/>
expect.  Things get more efficient and easier.<br/>
<br/>
So, certainly it&#39;s possible to organize and pull off a non-guild <br/>
event like this, there are many obstacles in place making it <br/>
extremelly difficult.  I wonder if any dragon or plane has been <br/>
successfully done without a guild of some kind organizing it.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up joining that guild about 2 weeks ago.  We went on our <br/>
first &quot;guild&quot; raid into Chardok last Friday.  It kicked ass.  This <br/>
being only my 2nd raid ever, I just watched, listened, and obeyed.  I <br/>
was lucky enough to be in the group with the &quot;leaders&quot; of the raid so <br/>
I could see and hear what was going on more than if I was in one of <br/>
the other groups.  We ended up getting to the named mob (Kor <br/>
something.. a very large Sarnak) and killing him.  He was about level <br/>
57 necessitating a pretty much melee only attack (almost every caster <br/>
was resisted).  I crashed to desktop when I was quad hit for 260, so <br/>
I didn&#39;t get a screenshot of him killing me about 20 seconds before <br/>
he died.  Then, pathing bugs caused the party to get wiped out by <br/>
other normal mobs allowing me to get experience doing my first real <br/>
corpse recovery. :)  This was about 2 more hours of pulling the mobs <br/>
that saw invis to the zone for their execution by numerous people <br/>
in &quot;pajamas&quot; and having a few brave souls pulling corpse after corpse.<br/>
<br/>
On a Bard related note:  1 Symphonic Saber dropped.  It was me and <br/>
another Bard from my guild in the lotto.  I was #1, she was #2.  The <br/>
guild leader rolled a 2. :-/  I&#39;m petitioning for favortism due to <br/>
her being in the guild longer. :-)  j/k<br/>
