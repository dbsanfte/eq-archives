<b>Subject:</b> Its not just Dendall, but alot of the Soerbaird. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-904383265">It&#39;s been my observation that alot of the Soerbaird are arrogant, clique-ish and self-important. Dendall, Isara, Jythri and Amrothe come to mine, all on the Fennin Ro server. Dendall , you may remember from that particularly rude thread (yea SnowLynx! Sort him out! ;P ) about people with &quot;poor deductive logic&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things&quot; . my experiences with Amrothe are that alot of people actively dislike him, he is rude, many claim that he has &quot;trained&quot; them with devastating monsters using Accelerando, such as sand giants, and that he steals kills. i have seen him fighting and swearing on /ooc and /shout in oasis with people i know to be good, if rather agravatable, people. My experience with Isara and Jythri comes down to just plain meanness. i was talking to Isara, who is also a guide (kinda makes you wonder?) who i was talking to with my other character, an enchanter, and accidentally hit the &quot;slap&quot; macro key i set in Socials instead of the Wave key, and she proceeded to /duel me, and she was at least lvl 15, where i was 7. Being an Erudite, i tried to RP it, being so sure of my intellectual superiority, that she could not defeat me. i cast Invisibility on myself and started looking for her, knowing that the only way i stood a chance was to hit and run. she shouted insults to me, and i playfully shot back, and then Jythri came along and could somehow see me even though i was invisible, told isara my location, and then chased me to the guards, where i turned off Invis, expecting them not to attack because the guards would protect me, as they had in the past. that was not a wise assumption. Isara attacked me, and the guards did nothing, but when i attacked back, they slaughtered me. when i came back, outraged that i had died due to jythri&#39;s interference (isn&#39;t the definition of a duel one on one, not one against one and their guild?) i shouted that Jythri&#39;s meddling was an outrage, a dishonorable, rude, and cruel thing to do, and i would make him pay for it! he told me he /ignored me. when i talked to isara about this, she told me to quit whining ( i admit, i was but i had just died to a bard who could somehow see invisible, and whom the guards would not attack, but would attack me , two very questionable tactics , although i dont want to say exploit thats what i think they were) she told me that she was a GM and if i pursued the issue anymore i would get banned.i have been beta testing since phase 2 and am good friends with one of the coders, so i didn&#39;t take it seriously.but does EverQuest really want their guides representing them like this, and do bards really want the &quot;Official&quot; bards&#39; guild having such a bad reputation?</div>
