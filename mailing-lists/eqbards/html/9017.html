<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314730326">I don&#39;t have answers for you but I have a related question I will tack on to<br/>
yours.  Last night I grouped with another bard in Unrest.  He sang Psalm of<br/>
Cooling while I sang Psalm of Warmth.  I also had Elemental Rhythms<br/>
memorized.  When we fought skeletons that could cast spells, we had both of<br/>
the Psalms up.  However, when I tried to weave Elemental Ryhtnms I never got<br/>
the message that it kicked in  I assume that indicates it doesn&#39;t stack with<br/>
the Psalm series.  Can someone confirm this please?<br/>
<br/>
To recap, here is what I know about our resist buffs songs.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Elemental and Purifying rhythms do not stack together<br/>
2)  Guardian Rhythms will stack with Elemental or Purifying.<br/>
<br/>
Need to confirm:<br/>
1)  Do the rhythm series songs stack with the Psalm series?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Greetings, I am a newly 27th bard ON tarrew Marr and I have a couple<br/>
&gt; questions reguards a few songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know psalm of warmth adds a 5 point damage shield. I am wondering how<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; damage the the psalm of cold is?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. the song Psalm of Vitality as I have listed is JUST poison resist.<br/>
&gt; Since<br/>
&gt; it is a Psalm I am wondering if it ( and psalm of purity as well) are<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; shields as well and if so how much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. I have pretty much started to phase out bellow song to use the slot for<br/>
&gt; something more group oriented. My question is the level 30 Fufils<br/>
&gt; curtailing<br/>
&gt; chant. It stated target damage and -magic resist. I would like to know<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; about this song i e how much dd it does and is that song worth taking up a<br/>
&gt; song slot for another DD song? how much MR does it lower? This follows<br/>
&gt; along<br/>
&gt; with my curiosity of the other chants (flame etc)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the information ahead of time..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tuldar newly 27th song.<br/>
