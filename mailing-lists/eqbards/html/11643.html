<br/>
&gt;P.S. Remember that what a druid can solo and what a bard can solo easily<br/>
&gt;are two different things. The bane of the bard class is any casting<br/>
&gt;monster, while we can shred most lower level meleers quite easily.<br/>
&gt;Casting classes love to burn down casters. Also ask the druid how many<br/>
&gt;huge trains he&#39;s pulled to the zone after messing up a pull on the<br/>
&gt;Butler, or how many times he moved to the wrong spot and had both cooks<br/>
&gt;aggro on him (assumes he is KOS in MM). Most will say none, but in fact<br/>
&gt;the super huge trains at the zone in MM are usually as a result of one<br/>
&gt;higher level player putting everyone in jeopardy instead of just dying<br/>
&gt;quietly and peacefully. I am *not* saying your druid friend does this,<br/>
&gt;but maybe he does. Also, the point about the con in wolfform is<br/>
&gt;important. Let&#39;s see him try fighting the &quot;easy&quot; butler in place without<br/>
&gt;Wolfform *laugh*.<br/>

I was in wolf form.  I was not KOS in wolf form.  I did in fact harmony the<br/>
mobs there.  However I forgot 1 gargoyle and died.  I did have the good grace<br/>
to die and not spirit of cheetah to the zone killing countless lower levels.  I<br/>
did return and kill the Butler solo very easily (with correct application of<br/>
harmony this time).  In fact I buffed up, damage shielded, harmonied, DoT&#39;d the<br/>
butler and just greater healed myself as needed *melee*ing him to death.<br/>

Those are all pretty valid points, and in fact, last time i was in Mistmoore a<br/>
lvl 50 Druid brought the entire castle down on my poor 23rd level head.(OUCH!)<br/>
<br/>
But, in the case of this Druid, he is someone that i work with, so i know his<br/>
tactics etc.  He has made errors in the castle twice.  the errors were: 1. <br/>
tried to solo the Cloaked Damphyr at too low a level.  He tried to gate and<br/>
died.  2.  Tried to solo Lasna Cheroon (sp?) and missed a harmony somewhere. <br/>
He got the gate off and lived (i was on the phone with him at the time)  <br/>
As i think i stated before, he is not KOS in Mistmoore (in wolf form), he has<br/>
never killed anything but named mobs, which do not hit you with the faction<br/>
adjustment.  He also is more one of those &quot;fight it out while mashing the gate<br/>
button&quot; types than the &quot;run to zone and pick up human sheilds&quot; types.  Alot of<br/>
druids i have seen are the latter, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
[Insert annoying Druid type comment again:]<br/>
Yes I try to gate out rather than train and kill folks...would rather die<br/>
myself than get others killed. :)  Actually most of the named mobs there do<br/>
have a faction hit but if you just run through in wolf checking which nameds<br/>
are up you can kill them on and off over 15 or so levels without lowering your<br/>
faction a whole lot. :)<br/>
Well actually you *can* camp npc Bards to raise your MM faction...of course I<br/>
haven&#39;t done this...yet. :)<br/>
[end annoying insert]<br/>
<br/>
heh...he just walked over to my cube and was reading over my shoulder....<br/>
<br/>
I did not want to imply that a lvl 32 Bard could solo the butler if that is<br/>
what i did.  Obviously, we are just not equipped to even GET there, let alone<br/>
solo a named mob (caster, no less) that is only 2 lvls below us.  But, you<br/>
could probably bribe a druid to get it for you. : )<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
