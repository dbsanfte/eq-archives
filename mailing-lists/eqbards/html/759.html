<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671245559">This is a matter of opinion really, since both ways are simple, if you<br/>
know the route, and both ways will kill you unexpectedly.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer the Runnyeye/Beholder route.  Yes, there are<br/>
sometimes trains in Runny, and there are sometimes Evil Eyes in Beholder<br/>
that charm you, but all in all, I have had much more luck here.  When<br/>
going through in transit, I have only died on this route once.<br/>
<br/>
Highpass&#39; problem is the packs of gnolls and orcs at each end, combined<br/>
with its rather confusing route.   It&#39;s easy to remember &quot;stick to the<br/>
right wall&quot; when going from Misty to Beholder.  It&#39;s not easy to<br/>
remember &quot;go in, under the arch, stick to the right, over the bridge,<br/>
down in front of the keep, take the first left, follow it around, hop<br/>
over the log and follow the trail&quot;.  (BTW, that&#39;s not the real route,<br/>
though it&#39;s something like that).  I can make it through Highpass<br/>
without getting killed now, but all in all I have died probably 5 times<br/>
making my way through there, usually because I took a wrong turn and<br/>
walked into the smugglers.  <br/>
<br/>
The choice is up to you, but I recommend Beholder and Runnyeye, it has<br/>
much more room for a bard to maneuver.<br/>

&gt; I keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>
&gt; I want to go to Qeynos there are two options. Either RunnEye or High<br/>
&gt; Hold Pass. I hear in HighHold there are gnolls who will kill me and in<br/>
&gt; RunnEye I&#39;ll have 10 creatures trained on me. I don&#39;t like to train, nor<br/>
&gt; do I like to die. So please let me know, whats the safest way for a<br/>
&gt; level 10 Bard to travel from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
