This next song goes out to everyone who&#39;s had a corpse fall through the<br/>
world.  It&#39;s called &quot;Last Kiss&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh where oh where can my body be<br/>
Shaman gnoll took it away from me<br/>
I died while zoning and you know that&#39;s not good<br/>
Now I have to loot my body before it leaves this world<br/>
<br/>
I was hunting Blackburrow with an Inky named Scarth<br/>
a basement train started but the zone wasn&#39;t far<br/>
somehow I passed it, a dead end straight ahead<br/>
I zoned running backwards then I went link dead<br/>
<br/>
Back near the zone Lyssa&#39;s told me go right<br/>
Scarth&#39;s necro spell confirmed my very worst fright<br/>
I screamed aloud as another train passed<br/>
&quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot; was the thing I saw last<br/>
<br/>
Oh where oh where can my body be<br/>
zone border bug took it away from me<br/>
can&#39;t go to heaven &#39;cause I&#39;m an atheist bard<br/>
whoever thought that dying could ever be this hard.<br/>
