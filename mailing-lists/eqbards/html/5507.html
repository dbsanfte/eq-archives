<div id="ygrps-yiv-978074210"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;going through the zone to enter the Keep in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
&gt; &gt;to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ya got hit with an undocumented feature<br/>
&gt; him back to his last save point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing is, I didn&#39;t die nor was I being attacked<br/>
or chased. I was a few bubbles down on health due to<br/>
a previous fight (that ended) and when I rezoned in<br/>
the wrong place I was at full health. So that was<br/>
nifty at least - but at the time of hitting the zone,<br/>
I was nowhere near death and again, not being attacked.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This was implemented because there *is* a couple of second <br/>
&gt; overlap while<br/>
&gt; you are plucked from one server and plopped into the other.  <br/>
&gt; During this<br/>
&gt; time, if you died, there&#39;d be a corpse in one zone, while <br/>
&gt; your healthy body<br/>
&gt; was in the second zone.  You could then, theoretically skip <br/>
&gt; back and loot<br/>
&gt; your corpse, duping items.  Thus we have the new system, <br/>
&gt; which results in<br/>
&gt; some occasional peculiarities.<br/>
