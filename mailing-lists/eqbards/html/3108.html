<div id="ygrps-yiv-325852225">&lt;I have been using harmonizing despite that not being technically<br/>
correct.  The playing of multiple notes at once is polyphany, as in a flute<br/>
is Monophonic, one note at a time, while a piano is polyphonic as it can<br/>
sound multiple notes at once.  Harmonizing using refers to separate<br/>
musicians playing diferent notes on the same rythym, but I can&#39;t offhand<br/>
think of a better term.  &gt;<br/>

Cannot... comprehend...    Too much... INFORMATION!<br/>
