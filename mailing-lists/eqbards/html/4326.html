&gt; Ok, there is some RP connections to these guys???  The one is HH is new to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dvinn in Crushbone<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His name is Ambassador Dvinn for a reason - he&#39;s the dark elf<br/>
representative negotiating some sort of treaty with the<br/>
Crushbone orcs.  There&#39;s a Kelethin Ranger and Felwithe<br/>
Paladin quest involving the orc runner in Butcherblock who is<br/>
carrying messages about all this (which had the evil races<br/>
upset because the orc runner would attack them, and they used<br/>
to lose dark elf faction when they killed it).<br/>
<br/>
The one in HH is also party of some quest.<br/>
