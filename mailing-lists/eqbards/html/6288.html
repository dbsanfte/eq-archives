<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-484760383">Well, the real problem here is Verant has some idea in their head that EQ is<br/>
a RPG type game.  Ok, it is but compared to what I hear about the pen &<br/>
paper games - where play was such that each swing by each player was a die<br/>
roll - and all the chatter and such between turns - yikes it musta took<br/>
forever to play.  <br/>
<br/>
Now enter the &quot;Quake&quot; generation - we want action, we want it fast, and we<br/>
want lots of it!!!  We want Unrest on Steroids!!!<br/>
<br/>
Add 50,000 players, mix together - shake well and opps!  Things turning out<br/>
a bit differently than we planned .... hmmmmm what can we nerf to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>
things and stop the powerful gamers from getting lev 50 in 40 days played<br/>
time....this can&#39;t be - not good for RP.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not the answer - Verant - wake up and make the high level world<br/>
Dynamic!  Keep track of the monsters and make them get harder and meaner or<br/>
have better AI depending on how well the last fights were.  If Thulaak, etal<br/>
slays a dragon - make the next one have better guards - or spawn in<br/>
different place with badder stuffs - Make the Planes be dynamic environments<br/>
- that have dynamic AI for battling these lev 50&#39;s.  And if you can do this<br/>
in code - you wont have to spend so much resources  coding and arting new<br/>
zones - make the ones you got dynamic.<br/>

		Heh, don&#39;t misconstrue my email as a flame.  I certainly<br/>
have nothing<br/>
		personal against you or any other 50th level character.  I&#39;m<br/>
simply<br/>
		debating the philosophy behind playing a level 50 character,<br/>
and whether<br/>
		Verant really ever intended people to play maxxed out<br/>
characters for very<br/>
		long.</div>
