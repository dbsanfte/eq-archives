<div id="ygrps-yiv-739874330">In regard to monks, they have a penalties to their AC if the weighs goes<br/>
above 15lbs.  It is also their bonus because each lvl they go up their AC<br/>
goes up also by a lot.  It is one of the reason I stop playing a monk.  I<br/>
have to throw away all my loot if I want to be in top shape.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that I did because Bard Rocks!!!!<br/>

The main reason I don&#39;t advocate increasing Str is based on some Monk<br/>
research that seems to confirm that increased weight regardless of str<br/>
adversely affects the dodge skill to a great degree.  therefore wearing the<br/>
best lightest armor may help you totally avoid a blow that would otherwise<br/>
hit you for reduced damage in heavier armor.<br/>

&gt; Well here are my thoughts...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Put 10 in Dex, 5 in Int, and the rest in Agi<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an almost religious topic among bards, but in my opinion, put all<br/>
the<br/>
points you can into strength.  Someday, if you are like most bards, you will<br/>
want to wear plate, and if you have 70 strength, forget about wearing even<br/>
banded mail.<br/>
