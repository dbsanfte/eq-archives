<div id="ygrps-yiv-32988363">This was parsed by someone and posted on the tunare boards. He is reliable , <br/>
but believe/ look for yourself if you wish. I am not posting the link b/c it <br/>
got screwed up last time.<br/>
<br/>
Copied from thread : Bards got NERFED!! plus some other spell changes.<br/>
<br/>
              Bewitching Bravura got its mana quadrupled in cost and maybe <br/>
its max limit changed (hard to tell)<br/>
<br/>
                   That was to be expected but Selo&#39;s Accelandro and Selo&#39;s <br/>
Song of Travel both got capped at 66% haste now...which is SLOWER than Spirit <br/>
of Scale. Actually its not that much or a nerf and more of an insult heh.<br/>
<br/>
                   The Druid and Shaman resistance spells (Circle of Summer, <br/>
Circle of Winter etc) all got raised to increase resist by 45 instead of 40<br/>
<br/>
                   Rage of zomm got its casting time lowered by 1 second<br/>

Some other people can check it out to make sure it is true , or at least has <br/>
the possibility of being true. whether it will go live or not remains to be <br/>
seen.<br/>
