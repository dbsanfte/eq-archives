<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127096211"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; OK that explains why Largos was sticking better.  I saw the &quot;mob glances<br/>
&gt; around nervously&quot; message every time we fought something.  Didn&#39;t know that<br/>
&gt; was the message for Tashan though.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s funny to see things cast upon you too when a person is charmed.<br/>
<br/>
  Tashan, mob glances around nervously to you, but:<br/>
<br/>
  You hear the barking of Tashan, to the victim.<br/>
<br/>
  If you were curious as to why the npc was glancing around it&#39;s because<br/>
  a big freaking wolf/dog is chasing it (in it&#39;s mind).  Why this lowers<br/>
  magic resistance I have no idea ;-)<br/>
