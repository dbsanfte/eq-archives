<div id="ygrps-yiv-183722008">&quot;A rogue BS does good...when it does good damage.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t think the damage dealt has anything to do with it. I happenenned to<br/>
taunt MOBs pf a pal missing a BS with ,y rogue. I think it&#39;s the same way<br/>
with every attack (be it melee or spell) : you can hit for full, partial or<br/>
miss / be resisted, the taunt effect is the same, at least it seemed to be<br/>
in my experience.<br/>

5 deaths per level is much more than you should be having.  In an outdoor<br/>
zone you have your speed song, which should prevent amost ANY death.<br/>
Indoors, if you cannot find a spot near the zone to fight at, then<br/>
make sure you group with a wizard or a druid thats knows how to evac.<br/>
<br/>
My general rule is ANYONE in the group can call for an <br/>
evac, and the evac&#39;er immediately and without questioning would evac.<br/>
Figure out later if it was the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you have a balanced group.<br/>
Clerics have about 7x the healing power of druids/shamans.<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a cleric in the group, play &quot;less efficiently&quot;<br/>
so that you do not attract attention, if this means just bellowing<br/>
straight, then do it and don&#39;t worry about it.  A dead bard is of<br/>
no help to the group.<br/>
<br/>
A warrior is the best taunting melee in the game.  A rogue BS does<br/>
good...when it does good damage.  A monk is fair, when he gets a lucky<br/>
round of hits..A warrior just flat taunts.  If you don&#39;t have one of<br/>
these -- be more careful.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers/Druids/Shamans usually think of healing as a secondary priority.<br/>
Paladins that stand around after combat also think of any<br/>
heals they have as extra&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Watch your group, watch the spells being cast.  If the druid is<br/>
putting Damage shield up every fight on both himself and the<br/>
main tank, and casting the swarm and snare, he likely isn&#39;t<br/>
saving mana to do major healing.  If the shaman is keeping<br/>
speed buffs up on everyone and casting dex/agi buffs all<br/>
around, he isn&#39;t saving for major healing either.  If the cleric,<br/>
thinks smite is the best form of DD in the game (run!) then<br/>
um, no healing there either.<br/>
<br/>
If you join a group with a druid/cleric and they do not immediately<br/>
cast skin like xxx or bravery/valor/resolution on everyone ...<br/>
<br/>
If any single fight, &quot;normal&quot; fight takes the group over half way<br/>
down in hp and mana, that is too hard of a source of experience,<br/>
and you are going to find yourself dieing a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Not all of these statements are true, but they give you some<br/>
thoughts on how to &quot;read&quot; a pickup group.<br/>

I died 7 times from level 29 to level 50, it can be done.<br/>

&gt; honest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>
&gt; every level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>
&gt; have now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>
&gt; die, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>
&gt; levels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>

&gt; this list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>
&gt; think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>
&gt; asked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;<br/>

&gt; Guess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>found<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>
&gt; problem is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I play<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>
&gt; turns bad<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>
&gt; away,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>
&gt; casters<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>back<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;zone they died in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs<br/>
&gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;welfare.<br/>
