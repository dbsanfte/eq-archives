<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549984666">A Troll warrior gave me one of these in WK several<br/>
weeks ago.  I was maybe lvl 15 at the time and really<br/>
happy to get it.  He said he looted it and didn&#39;t want<br/>
it.  I didn&#39;t ask at the time.  Wish I had now.<br/>

&gt; &gt;There is a magic necklace that is a good item for<br/>
&gt; low to mid level bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;that is fairly easy to acquire solo.  Its called<br/>
&gt; the Order of Thunder (no<br/>
&gt; &gt;drop) and is found off a named zombie in the Qeynos<br/>
&gt; aqueducts.  Its been a<br/>
&gt; &gt;while since I wore it (got a Cape of the Midnight<br/>
&gt; Mist now) but IIRC one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the bonuses is +5 charisma.  It also has a small AC<br/>
&gt; boost as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt;function as a light source.  Check out a spoiler<br/>
&gt; site if you want to know<br/>
&gt; &gt;all the stats on it.<br/>
