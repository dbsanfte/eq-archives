should give such warning.  That said, I&#39;ll offer my take on this forum and<br/>
spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
I play EverQuest way too much.  Since I got it I no longer vegetate in<br/>
front of the TV.  I play.  Hmmmm.  Maybe overall that is an improvement.  :-)}<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, even playing that much there&#39;s a lot I miss due to time or don&#39;t<br/>
figure out or am a bit too careful about.  In my mind and on an in-game<br/>
basis, this forum represents a conclave of bards, helping one another.  I&#39;m<br/>
a dedicated roleplayer, trying to keep the fantasy intact as much as I can<br/>
and avoiding fantasy-busters such as /loc or talking too much in terms of<br/>
software mechanisms, but I&#39;m sure in an alternate reality like our game<br/>
world bards would share tales and information, suggesting good places to<br/>
see, profitable ventures, and particularly effective techniques and equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Some want to discover it all for themselves.  Some want the most power the<br/>
fastest.  Some want to live a fantasy life.  I want to have fun and avoid<br/>
major frustration and I find this forum a wonderful resouce to those ends.<br/>

Keep the information flowing.  It is the life blood that runs through the<br/>
veins of the bards, the heart and soul of Norrath.<br/>
