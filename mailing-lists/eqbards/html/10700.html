<div id="ygrps-yiv-841480847">I just wanted to note that I had a lot of (admittedly ridiculous) fun at <br/>
this event.  It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it, but <br/>
try and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving <br/>
lutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the Dark <br/>
Elves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no sense of <br/>
humor?)<br/>
<br/>
I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge, where I <br/>
was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty others <br/>
that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition along <br/>
the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but kept <br/>
getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>
<br/>
My roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched most <br/>
of it and found it hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci higher <br/>
level players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with <br/>
teleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you E&#39;ci <br/>
bards could pass on my thanks.<br/>
