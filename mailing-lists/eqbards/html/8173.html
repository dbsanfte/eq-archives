<div id="ygrps-yiv-228324279">Interesting that Kilij was traded for demon claws...but I can see the reason<br/>
why.  <br/>
<br/>
The Kilij is a new and interesting weapon that requires a bit of running<br/>
around and collecting things...something that a lot of people don&#39;t want to<br/>
take the time to do. At the same time a group in Cazic fighting the Avatar<br/>
for the rubi chest will walk away with maybe one of those and a dozen claws.<br/>
At that level you can sell the claws for 400pp or whatever, but you don&#39;t<br/>
really need the money anymore so the claws work well as trade items.<br/>
<br/>
How hard was it to kill the Giant that you need to kill for this quest?  Was<br/>
he hard to find? Does he spawn often?  What was the makeup of your group<br/>
when you took him out?  <br/>

&gt; I have to agree with this as well.  You&#39;re much better off using your<br/>
&gt; Dragoon Dirk in your primary and secondary wield a barbed whip.  Quite<br/>
&gt; simply, the Dragoon Dirk is a superior weapons.  If you can <br/>
&gt; get some Thulian<br/>
&gt; Claws or a Silvery War Axe, then I&#39;d move that to primary and <br/>
&gt; the Dirk to<br/>
&gt; secondary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Incidentally, I just traded my Brazen Brass Kilij for Thulian Claws<br/>
&gt; lastnight.  I didn&#39;t realize that they carried so much clout <br/>
&gt; (the Kilij).<br/>
&gt; Definitely gonna have to get another one.<br/>

&gt; One thing I would consider is replacing at least one of your <br/>
&gt; two barbed<br/>
&gt; leather whips.  I used to dual wield a dragoon dirk and <br/>
&gt; barbed leather whip.<br/>
&gt; In combats that lasted more than a minute, the barbed leather <br/>
&gt; whip would<br/>
&gt; cause a serious stamina drain.  I would venture to guess that <br/>
&gt; dual wielding<br/>
&gt; two of them is even more severe.  I now dual wield thulian <br/>
&gt; claws (cost me<br/>
&gt; 400PP) and a dragoon dirk.  In groups, very rarely does my <br/>
&gt; stamina drop<br/>
&gt; below one bub anymore, even after long combats.  The only <br/>
&gt; time it will drop<br/>
&gt; below one bub is if I am soloing a blue that takes me forever to kill.<br/>
&gt; Obviously you can avoid the stamina drain by singing the Jig <br/>
&gt; but you could<br/>
&gt; free up that song slot and memorize a different song by equipping some<br/>
&gt; weapons lighter than the barbed leather whips.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my opinion.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I manage to accumulate some pp and now is the time to buy<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff. ;-) I have my Level 20 song and I now want to optimize my<br/>
&gt; &gt; stats and stuff a little bit. I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>
&gt; &gt; message<br/>
&gt; &gt; then I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>
&gt; &gt; would not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>
&gt; &gt; and equipment. If you need to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Dragoon Dirk. I can&#39;t afford Platinum jewelry.<br/>
