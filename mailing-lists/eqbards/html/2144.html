<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588015281">it only does damage to other players in a PvP zone or on the PvP server.<br/>
and it does go up as you level.  the best way to find out is to duel a<br/>
friend and have him check his health as you play it on him.<br/>

&gt; Supposedly this spell gets more power as you advance, does <br/>
&gt; anyone know to<br/>
&gt; what extent?  Initally in the lower levels 1-6 I found this <br/>
&gt; spell to be a<br/>
&gt; great way to kill myself, either in attracting that ever <br/>
&gt; popular guard you<br/>
&gt; forgot patrolled your area of the incredible &quot;there he is <br/>
&gt; that guy, everyone<br/>
&gt; get him!&quot; attraction feature of this song.  But lately at 9th <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had alot<br/>
&gt; of fun practicing my String skill and nuking lvl 1 characters <br/>
&gt; in the newbie<br/>
&gt; areas of freeport.  But I&#39;m curious just how much damage does <br/>
&gt; this song<br/>
&gt; actually do anyways?  I&#39;ve been using it more and more in the <br/>
&gt; desert taking<br/>
&gt; spiders and such.  Makes for a great helper if you think <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re not gonna<br/>
&gt; make it out alive.  Sure you have to be sure nothing else is around<br/>
&gt; otherwise you&#39;ll be double/tripple teamed by creatures but <br/>
&gt; even still I<br/>
&gt; finally feel like its a useful spell.  Also in a party does <br/>
&gt; this spell also<br/>
&gt; do damage to members in your party as well?<br/>
