<div id="ygrps-yiv-177177601"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You can use it to take a break from a fight.  If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;soloing a blue and it&#39;s a close fight, charm it, equip a lute,<br/>
&gt;and weave Hymn and Sirens.  You will heal and the mob will<br/>
&gt;mostly stay charmed.  When you&#39;re comfortably healed, continue<br/>
&gt;the fight.  Be careful of the green-stuff-attacking-pet note<br/>
&gt;above - stuff that you&#39;re not used to having attack you may<br/>
&gt;attack your pet.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It works beautifully for stopping kill stealing casters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t quite work like that.  You can charm it once, but you cannot<br/>
maintain the charm.  The only time you can charm it again is after the charm<br/>
has worn off, and by that time both monsters are beating on you, making it<br/>
difficult to regain your positioning.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting note is that in PvP servers (only one I can really vouch<br/>
for) people can still kill your pet regardless of level limit.  For example<br/>
I was overseeing a little skirmish at the orc obelisk in Butcherblock with a<br/>
couple of kill stealers messing with a legitimate party&#39;s kills.  After a<br/>
while I attempted to charm the mob, thinking they wouldnt be able to attack<br/>
it since I was level 34 and they were level 15.  However they were still<br/>
able to attack it and get the credit for the experience and the kill.  ALSO,<br/>
if you&#39;re making two mobs fight charmed and say you kill the first one, get<br/>
the exp, and the second is more than halfway down in health, turns on you,<br/>
and someone steals the kill, they get the experience.  The damage it<br/>
sustains while under your control doesn&#39;t count as damage you&#39;ve inflicted,<br/>
which adds a bit of strategy if you&#39;re concerned about getting both kills.<br/>
