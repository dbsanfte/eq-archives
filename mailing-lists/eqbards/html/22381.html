<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017805865">The Spiroc Lord and the boss bee on the next island have never dropped anything for us, either.  Not even<br/>
cash.  The island 4 boss was broken for awhile but seems to have been fixed.  I don&#39;t get why they can&#39;t<br/>
fix this.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The only web sites I can find that list the components for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Plane of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sky Mask of the Songbird Quest show:  Ocher Tessara, Songbird<br/>
&gt; &gt; Statuette,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Light Woolen MANTLE.  Now, the Light Woolen Mantle is also used in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Songweaver&#39;s Mantle quest, and I have seen some posts that<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest that<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a typo, and that what is required is a Light Woolen MASK.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have any of you completed this quest, and if so, what object<br/>
&gt; &gt; is needed?<br/>
&gt; &gt; And do you remember which MOB(s) dropped it?  I heard it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shimmering Meteors, which my guild never does because of their really<br/>
&gt; &gt; annoying knockback effect.  I hate to ask my guild to try killing them<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it&#39;s pointless.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So far, we&#39;ve never seen a Light Woolen anything.<br/>
