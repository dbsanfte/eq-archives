This is very difficult to begin with.  So difficult (and risky, depending<br/>
upon what you&#39;re fighting), that I find it much more preferable to stand at<br/>
distance and let the two combatants duke it out - then I wade in and polish<br/>
off the &quot;winner&quot;.  Done correctly you should get the EXP for both.<br/>
