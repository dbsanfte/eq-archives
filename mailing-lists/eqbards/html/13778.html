I don&#39;t know either way, myself. But mistakes have been made, even<br/>
with lots of people going around looking for stuff.<br/>

&gt;Well its been several months now since they were first mentioned in a patch<br/>
&gt;and still no one has discovered a small brass trumpet or Kelin&#39;s practice<br/>
&gt;Lute.  I know not all bards spend as much time running around asking people<br/>
&gt;about quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I am<br/>
&gt;fairly certain<br/>
&gt;that if these really were in the game they would have been found<br/>
&gt;by now.  GZ<br/>
&gt;insisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard<br/>
&gt;for them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities<br/>
&gt;and the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any<br/>
&gt;of those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or<br/>
&gt;is this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant<br/>
&gt;thinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?  Certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time<br/>
&gt;they were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;especially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the<br/>
&gt;scorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when<br/>
&gt;they were<br/>
&gt;not.  Any ideas?<br/>
