<div id="ygrps-yiv-275706356">You might have also pointed out to him that he could<br/>
have pettitioned a gm for it.  Of course, on erollisi<br/>
marr we have very few gm&#39;s and I&#39;ve actually gone the<br/>
lenght of OOT with people when no gm&#39;s were there to<br/>
help.  Kinda nice, every now and then when I auction<br/>
in Kelethin, some on will shout out &quot;Llewrend, your<br/>
still my hero&quot; or something like that.  Some times a<br/>
bards just gotta sit at home and watch the kids.<br/>
