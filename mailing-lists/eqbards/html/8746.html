<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835232407">I&#39;ve gotten the arms.  Karnek has the pants, and I saw another bard sporting<br/>
the helm.  Only problem I&#39;ve heard about is with the breastplate.  I&#39;m going<br/>
to try the boots tonight probably (whoo hoo! got another lambent stone), so<br/>
we&#39;ll see what happens.  I&#39;m guessing its just the BP.<br/>
Genni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the location, but I was<br/>
able to deal with him.  He&#39;s in a seperate location from the bards.<br/>

Last night I acquired the fixin&#39;s for two of the bard quests (arms and<br/>
boots), but when I got to the Temple, another bard told me that all the<br/>
bard quests were broken, according to a GM, and that nobody could find<br/>
Genni, the person who makes the lambent gems, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Did people have trouble making any of the pieces of armour besides the<br/>
previously mentioned breastplate problems? <br/>
