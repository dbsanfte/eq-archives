<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086388598">I&#39;m in Armigers of Mirth.  There is usually a group of Armigers hanging out<br/>
at the windmill, the Hounted Tower, or the Sarnak castle most nights.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been in Frontier Mountains lately hacking away at big giants. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Galtin&#39;s guild Disciples of Honor has an enormous number<br/>
of bards in it.  I think we have only three, me at 29 still, Rylos at 25,<br/>
and a very young bard<br/>
whose name escapes me right now.  We are working on organizing an alliance<br/>
with DoH to do those tougher things later on like Dragons etc.<br/>

with?<br/>
