I guess I am not as lucky as you. While I LOVE my bard to death (he is the<br/>
ONLY character I play), I do sometimes find it hard to find a group for<br/>
several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) Fewer High Level players- There will always be a lot more people lower<br/>
level than you, and when your level reaches loftiness of 30 and up, there<br/>
will be fewer people to join up with. Like aging, It&#39;s simply a matter of<br/>
attrition. Try doing a /w 1 29 all and then follow that with a /w 30 50 all.<br/>
Sure, a lot of the uber players might be anonymous, but not enough to<br/>
counter the immense number of lower level people. Luckily, after 20th it<br/>
seems, you can find someone within 10 levels of you either way, and you are<br/>
fine (that&#39;s been my experience anyway). Still, there were SO MANY people<br/>
when I was like levels 1-8... now... it&#39;s tough to find a full 6 within a<br/>
few levels of me.<br/>
<br/>
2) Guilds - Personally, I don&#39;t really care for guilds, for numerous<br/>
reasons. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think they DO belong in the game, as another<br/>
&quot;social incentive&quot;. But I don&#39;t know how many times I FINALLY find a group<br/>
of 4 or 5 people, and I ask to join, and get the &quot;you aren&#39;t part of our<br/>
guild, so no.&quot; response. Granted, quite a few times I&#39;ve gotten the &quot;Hey, we<br/>
need a good bard in our guild, wanna join?&quot; message in response, but<br/>
personally, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever join one. To me, I would feel too<br/>
obligated to answer the beck and call of my guildmates, and being a bard, I<br/>
am a bit TOO &quot;free willed&quot; to actually have enough willpower to do this<br/>
(smile). Regardless, most of the time I am actually turned away from a<br/>
group, it&#39;s because of their group being all of one guild.<br/>
<br/>
3) My class- I know, I know, Bards are the jack of all trades, master of<br/>
none. We do a lot of different things, just none of them masterfully. We<br/>
should EASILY be able to find groups, right? Nope. I HAVE been told on MANY<br/>
ocassions, point blank and bluntly, that BECAUSE I was a bard, I was not<br/>
wanted. &quot;You can&#39;t tank real well, you can&#39;t dish out damage, we have<br/>
healers, we have buffers, etc. etc. etc.&quot; Granted, I HAVE been told that<br/>
BECAUSE I was a bard, I WAS wanted! &quot;We need Selos!&quot; or &quot;We don&#39;t have a<br/>
cleric, and you&#39;re better than nothing!&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
4) Greed - Simple, undeniable greed. &quot;No, we don&#39;t want you because Rubicite<br/>
is rare enough, and since you can wear it, you might loot it or hassle us<br/>
about getting it.&quot; And of course, one I&#39;ve heard a LOT &quot;We are doing fine<br/>
with 3 people. Adding you would just water down the EXP distribution.<br/>
Sorry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now Michal, don&#39;t get me wrong. I STILL like the bard best out of all the<br/>
classes in the game. I LOVE my bard TO DEATH (uhh... quite literally,<br/>
actually, as I retrieve my corpse for the third time in ten minutes). But, I<br/>
was just pointing out that the original poster&#39;s complaints were not<br/>
unfounded, and in fact his/her problems are frequently experienced by<br/>
others, on other servers.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do not have such a dismal outlook on the class. Sure, there are<br/>
things that I would CHANGE, but are we, overall, the weakest class in the<br/>
game? The strongest? We could discuss this into the next century, but I for<br/>
one believe we&#39;re right there in the middle with the rest of them (smile).<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I snipped a quote from your message, above. While early on I<br/>
ocassionally received praise and comments like that (because of Hymn and<br/>
Selo&#39;s), I can not believe the LOVE that is heaped on me now that I am past<br/>
32nd level. I can not believe the absolute LOVE that spellcasters heap upon<br/>
me when I play the Mana Regen song. Heck, a FEW of my more common mage<br/>
friends have actually become quite POSSESSIVE of ME!!!! Talk about &quot;stroking<br/>
your ego&quot; or feeling important, it feels GREAT!  For a long time, I felt<br/>
like our class got little respect, except from people who KNEW what we were<br/>
capable of. Now, no matter what, and at least from spellcasters, we have a<br/>
whole new load of respect coming to us after 32nd level. And heaven forbid<br/>
you get two or more bards with this song in a high level group!!! WOOHOO!!<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 copper&#39;s worth, sorry if this was boring,<br/>
