<div id="ygrps-yiv-375525727">I&#39;m not one now but unless things have changed very dramatically I&#39;d say<br/>
your issue is going to wind up in the hands of the server GM.  It&#39;s going to<br/>
wind up being a discretionary call on his part.  They have said, repeatedly,<br/>
that the no-drop flag isn&#39;t perfect and that they wouldn&#39;t reimburse dropped<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
However in the extenuating circumstances you describe myself and my former<br/>
gm would reimburse the loss most likely.  Depending on your past reputation<br/>
and number of warnings on your account (we used this for credibility<br/>
purposes).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say you have about a 70/30 chance.<br/>

&gt; Monday night I did a dumb thing.  My inventory was full from having<br/>
&gt; adventured for 4 or 5 days without visiting a merchant, so I refreshed my<br/>
DE<br/>
&gt; illusion, memmed Carillon and went to Tin Merchant IX in the Overthere.  I<br/>
&gt; switched out my weapons for the drum to run there.  There wasn&#39;t a slot<br/>
open<br/>
&gt; so I just left my Wraith Bone Hammer floating on the pointer.  I know, I<br/>
&gt; know, I should&#39;ve destroyed some muffins or carried them on the pointer.<br/>
&gt; Hindsight is 20/20.  Anyway I left clicked on the merchant to target him<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; the Carillon and the trade window came up.  I cancelled the trade and the<br/>
&gt; Hammer dropped to the ground and the merchant picked it up and destroyed<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; I had Nodrop set to confirm.  I immediately petitioned it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Guide after some discussion promoted my petition to the Senior Guide.<br/>
&gt; The Senior Guide spoke to me Tuesday night, he wasn&#39;t online on Monday,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; asked where and when the event occurred.  He never got back to me before<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; logged and I finally logged myself.  I haven&#39;t heard back from him yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my opinion even in this situation the confirm drop window should have<br/>
&gt; come up and I could then have emptied an inventory slot, picking up<br/>
&gt; something less valuable to drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since you&#39;ve been a Senior Guide, tell me, do I have any hope?<br/>
