&gt;That may work while soloing (I&#39;m not sure as I don&#39;t charm kite), but<br/>
&gt;he was trying to show with his example that &quot;allowing charm to break&quot;<br/>
&gt;in a group setting would poof the mob you&#39;re fighting.  In that<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, excellent. Sorry, I missed that nuance. Just too hooked into soloing <br/>
work I suppose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I looked up the info on eqsongs.com and figured that perhaps I had misread <br/>
Kaearia&#39;s info as to affecting bards as well. If you have a quote directly <br/>
from Kaearia that shows his analysis, I&#39;d love to read it.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
