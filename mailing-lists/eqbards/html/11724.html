<div id="ygrps-yiv-53056021">Yep...this was the spot.  We held it for a few hours tho...bad luck on a big <br/>
spawn plus pull.  That SK liked me.  Everytime he spawned he made a beeline <br/>
for the bard.<br/>

&gt; &gt; part of the problem was the groups learning to work together.  Anyway, <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; those who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no <br/>
&gt;small<br/>
&gt; &gt; task.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a much easier way to the music room via the main gate.  I suppose<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s possible to simply clear your way there, but there would be some very<br/>
&gt;nasty fights.  Try to have someone who can pull singles, either from<br/>
&gt;knowledge of the zone or high enough archery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The area behind the music room is somewhat safe.  I went in with a 50<br/>
&gt;druid who knew the area very well, so I just let him do his thing.  For<br/>
&gt;everyone in guilds, see if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s experienced in<br/>
&gt;Mistmoorian pulling, and make sure they come along.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went in a week ago to help a paladin get his Soulfire hilt.  The SK that<br/>
&gt;drops it is in the jacuzzi room, which we reached via the secret room<br/>
&gt;entrance to the castle.  While sitting around waiting for him to spawn, I<br/>
&gt;got HT&#39;d.  One mob came through the door.  Ok we thought, no big deal.<br/>
&gt;Then another came.  Then another.  Then at least 20 more gargs, ancilles,<br/>
&gt;ushers, thought spoilers all piled into this teensy room.  The wiz, who<br/>
&gt;hadn&#39;t cast yet, was able to get off the port to faydark before anyone<br/>
&gt;dropped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Definitely not a place to visit on a whim.<br/>
