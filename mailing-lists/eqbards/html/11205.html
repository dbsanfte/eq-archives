<div id="ygrps-yiv-601571627">The thing is I really don&#39;t believe it matters if you get their attention or<br/>
not. Because smed showed up at the monk sit in every class now is talking<br/>
about having a sit in which is going to make it worthless. Also if Verant<br/>
really thought there was some problems with the Bard class then theywould<br/>
change it and it&#39;s close to impossible to change someboody&#39;s mind about<br/>
this. Look at necros all I heard were the normal complaints of any class and<br/>
verant just recently changed the screaming terror spell. It will happenwhen<br/>
and if Verant wants it to not when you or any other custuomer wants it to.<br/>

&gt;&gt;The bottom line is do we care enough to put the effort in to force change?<br/>
&gt;&gt;It is apparent that if we do not, Verant certainly will not.<br/>

&gt;I think something needs to be done.  Unfortunately, Verant doesnt have the<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m beginning to think if we don&#39;t get Verant&#39;s attention regarding bard<br/>
