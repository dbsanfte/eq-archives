<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106146124">yes that is going too far.  to clarify, our usual dragon loot rules are not<br/>
exactly anyone who can use the item, but anyone that WILL use the item on<br/>
the character that came on the raid.  not a single caster there would wear<br/>
that belt, period.  therefore they would not be in the lotto.<br/>

&gt; THEN came the belt and I forgot who the casters name was but <br/>
&gt; he yelled since<br/>
&gt; it was an all all that EVERYONE randoms for it.. now THAT is <br/>
&gt; crossing the<br/>
&gt; line.. I would LOVE LOVE LOVED to have that belt..i WOULD use <br/>
&gt; it and I WANT<br/>
&gt; a haste sash as I do not have one yet..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do agree bard are very deserving of a roll  in the belt.. a <br/>
&gt; caster on the<br/>
&gt; other hand....... I dont think should<br/>
