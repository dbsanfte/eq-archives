<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763323196">Range of Screech is pretty small.  It looks like you have to be within melee<br/>
range for it to work.  I often times will Fear + Chain Broon when I&#39;m<br/>
cruising through EK.  There have been a handful of times when I Fear him<br/>
that it does nothing... no message... no resists... nada.  If I move just a<br/>
couple steps closer, and re-apply Fear, it works as normal.  It&#39;s<br/>
disconcerting the first couple of times that it doesn&#39;t work, because you<br/>
still get the &quot;graphic&quot;, and you&#39;re sitting there waiting for your opponent<br/>
to run away.<br/>

Just what is the range of a Screech?  I just got it and was testing it on <br/>
goblins in Misty and Beholder, and it seems to me that it only works on <br/>
stuff very close to immediate melee range.  It seemed to be a very <br/>
small area.  Is this true?  Or does it take awhile to kick in?  Or does <br/>
range increase with level?  I did enjoy watching four goblins drop <br/>
everything and flee in terror.  Hehe.<br/>
