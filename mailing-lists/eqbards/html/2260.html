<div id="ygrps-yiv-960713163">Have you killed Nillipus?  He&#39;s a brownie.  It might have affected your<br/>
faction.  I&#39;ve only killed him a couple times, but it starts making me worry<br/>
that the Brownies will go hunting for me.  Thanks for the info about<br/>
wandering Brownies.<br/>

&gt; You wouldn&#39;t believe what some people think of Bards.  I was in Lesser Fay<br/>
&gt; last nite hunting for Crookstinger last nite, blast his elusive hide, when<br/>
&gt; all of a sudden a passing cleric started healing me.  I thanked him and<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; him he could save his mana as I was able to play a healing song that kept<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; in good shape.  He sais he had no idea bards could heal themselves???<br/>
&gt; Anyways we ended up teaming up for a bit of bandit bashing while we waited<br/>
&gt; for Crookstinger to show his ugly mug.  He finally did, but still no<br/>
&gt; dagger.<br/>
&gt; the cleric told me it was real nice not to have to blow all his mana after<br/>
&gt; one lousy bandit cause he knew I could heal him of 100 pts before the next<br/>
&gt; one showed up.  I didnt have the heart to tell him that was without my<br/>
&gt; mandolin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I have another name from the depths of Lesser Fay to add to my book of<br/>
&gt; grudges.  Some brownie named Bracken Underbrush, a high level druid,<br/>
&gt; ambushed me as I headed back from the wood elf outpost to Greater Faydark.<br/>
&gt; With SOW he was able to stay in range for some stunning spells and a lot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; stings and blasts.  Ouch, where the heck did this guy come from anyway?<br/>
&gt; Have the brownies taken to wandering at the bandits behest?  He assaulted<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; again on that hallowed hill but I was able to pop up a drum and race to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; zone.  He totally ignored the other 3 on the hill despite them being lower<br/>
&gt; level and my never having killed a single brownie, faerie, pixie, or other<br/>
&gt; diminutive humanoid.  Some day Bracken, some day...<br/>

&gt;       &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>
&gt;        and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
&gt;      &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
&gt;         and each to his separate star...&quot;<br/>
