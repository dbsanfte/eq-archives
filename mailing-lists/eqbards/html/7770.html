&gt; Fear and Chain work well on blues and white, but not<br/>
&gt; real well on yellows, and almost not at all on reds. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I chain/feared the Allizewsaur a bit in OOT. It didn&#39;t stick well enough<br/>
to be useful though, as you say. I&#39;ve even found some blues resist<br/>
enough to make it a marginally effective tactic. Others swear by it.<br/>
Strange.<br/>
<br/>
For any of you bored level 50 types, try the Allizewsaur(sp?) in the<br/>
OOT. He&#39;s L50 and if he&#39;s not around kill the goblin sacrifice, which<br/>
spawns in his place until he does spawn. We took out a full group of<br/>
49-50&#39;s and he is really, really tough.  The only tactic that worked for<br/>
us was to fight him until the casters were out of mana, then have our<br/>
warrior run him around the island while everyone medded back up. It took<br/>
almost 2 full mana med&#39;s to finally kill him. At one time he dropped<br/>
some very nice gems or jewellry, but it seemed overnight he was nerfed<br/>
to only drop lizard skin. That was a month or so again so it might be<br/>
fixed again. If you&#39;ve been wanting a diamond or jacinthe stone that&#39;s<br/>
the only place I&#39;ve ever seen one drop.<br/>
