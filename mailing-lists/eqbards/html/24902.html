NEVER EVER POWER-LEVEL ON QUESTS ALONE.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be worth a darned at all, it is very important that you <br/>
practice ALL of your skills from day one.  Powerlevelling too quickly can <br/>
neglect certain skills, which puts you at a massive disadvantage when it <br/>
comes to later life, and if you can&#39;t hit things, so while you&#39;re trying to <br/>
work your skills up, creatures are tearing you up.<br/>
<br/>
Questing for experience should only be done in the last half of a level, <br/>
after you&#39;ve maxed out your skills.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, after 20th level, who cares?  You get your skills maxed during <br/>
the first bubble anyway.<br/>
