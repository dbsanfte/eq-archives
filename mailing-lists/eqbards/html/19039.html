<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847104853">Only thing you need in Dalnir is off the Kly Imprecator (sp?).  The ancient<br/>
coin (Royal Crown of Dalnir) for the Ancient Coin Quest<br/>
<br/>
Hehe.  And I got one long before I went to Dalnir.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER:<br/>
The boss mob of the dungeon drops the Necklace of Superiority or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
5AC, +5 to all stats.  +10 to all resists.<br/>
<br/>
Be warned:  His placeholder has a 1000dmg AOE Attack.  So does he and he has<br/>
2x the hp.<br/>
<br/>
The placeholder (Kly Overseer) dropped a full group of 6 40+ members<br/>
<br/>
(oh, did I mention he was blue to level 39 ?)<br/>
