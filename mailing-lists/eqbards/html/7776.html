<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527388684">Played with my new Level 11 spell today.  Its a nice faction modifier, have<br/>
seen mysefl go from inddiferent to amiable and from apprehensive to<br/>
indifferent.  Aside from using it to move past the occasional hostile mob, I<br/>
was wondering if it had any use in actul combat?  Thanks for any insight.</div>
