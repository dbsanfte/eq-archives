<div id="ygrps-yiv-659654087">For one handed slash magic weapons that you don&#39;t pull off monsters, there are<br/>
really only two options worth considering, the Combine Scimitar and the Combine<br/>
Longsword.<br/>
<br/>
The scimitar&#39;s stats are something like 5/24.  The longswords stats are 6/26.<br/>
Numerically, the longsword is superior, but it costs something like 56 plat.  The<br/>
scimitar on the other hand, is something like 43.  If you are buying a weapon for<br/>
those special occasions when you need to hit a magical critter, but not to use as<br/>
your main weapon, the scimitar is probably good for your needs, particularly if<br/>
you&#39;re somewhat strapped for cash.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking to buy the weapon you&#39;re going to hand down to your<br/>
grandchildren when you retire after using it for years, then go with the<br/>
longsword.<br/>
<br/>
If money is absolutely no object, then buy a Well Balanced Longsword from the<br/>
Shady Swashbuckler in the East Commons tunnel.<br/>

&gt; Hail fellow bards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think about buying my first magical weapon right now and wanted to know<br/>
&gt; what kind of 1HS combine weapons do exist in the game. I&#39;ve just heard about<br/>
&gt; a combine longsword which you can buy at the gipsy camps. Are there other<br/>
&gt; combine weapons, maybe with better stats than the longsword? I just dont<br/>
&gt; wanna pay all my money for a combine longsword just to hear 1 day later that<br/>
&gt; there would be a much better combine bastardsword to buy for just 10pp more...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help.<br/>
