<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002034831">Hi everybody.  I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for quite a while now.  I<br/>
really like all the great information and friendly atmosphere here.  It<br/>
helps make it so fun to be a bard.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can help corroborate the theory that a flute boosts Charismatic<br/>
Carillion&#39;s effect (at least slightly).<br/>
<br/>
example:<br/>
About a month ago I spent most of a week helping my roommate&#39;s barbarian<br/>
warrior repeat the Langseax quest to get him a Langseax of the Wolves.  I<br/>
was 29th level at the time and I&#39;m pretty sure my wind skill was maxed, if<br/>
that matters.  My base faction with the Wolves of the North was <br/>
indifferent.  I Carillion&#39;ed Renth before I gave him my first Basil head<br/>
and it bumped my faction up to amiable.  Gave him the head and got &quot;Run<br/>
while you can... blah blah&quot;, faction still wasn&#39;t high enough to get the<br/>
langseax.  We go do the quest again and this time I Carillion Renth with<br/>
my flute.  It still only bumps my faction up to amiable, but this time he<br/>
gives me a langseax for the head.  On the next repeat of the quest I<br/>
forgot to use my flute with Carillion and he wouldn&#39;t give me the langseax<br/>
again.  We had to do the quest 20 times to get Paglan to spawn, by the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I&#39;m suggesting is that even though I was still only amiable<br/>
with the flute, it was a higher amiable than without the flute such that <br/>
he would let me successfully complete the quest only if I used the <br/>
flute.  Just an observation of mine, your mileage may vary.<br/>

&gt; &gt; carrilon also, once I used it on a dubious and didn&#39;t get my flute<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped before pulse, and she was only indifferent.  Repulsed with flute,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and she was amiable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I definitely need to test this again, because the flute made no<br/>
&gt;   difference whatsoever in any faction adjustments when I used it<br/>
&gt;   in the past.  Dubious to amiable?  Are you sure?  That&#39;s a bit<br/>
&gt;   much.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;    I just logged on to test this.  I could only find apprehensive things.<br/>
&gt;    I could not locate anything dubious (where I was at).  Both with and<br/>
&gt;    without the flute, I could get apprehensive to amiable.  I&#39;ll try <br/>
&gt;    again later when my boss is not expecting some project to be on my <br/>
&gt;    screen.  I think the merchants near the guard tower in Rathe Mountains<br/>
&gt;    are dubious to me, I&#39;m right outside Oggok now, so the trip would be <br/>
&gt;    quick. ;)<br/>
