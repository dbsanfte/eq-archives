<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042311434"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;          A couple of questions from a new bard on your list. (I apologize<br/>
&gt;      if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most<br/>
&gt;      interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must<br/>
&gt;      say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.<br/>
&gt;      (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area<br/>
&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a <br/>
&gt;step<br/>
&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>
&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Step by step would be to use a stringed instrument to target each individual <br/>
blue and then pull the yellow to your group, or back from the monsters to <br/>
solo.  Using an instrument seems to make a it last longer as you pull the <br/>
yellow one out.  Then you can use your hotkeyed melee/inventory slot to <br/>
switch to your weapons and finish the critter off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the<br/>
&gt;      Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal<br/>
&gt;      population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing<br/>
&gt;      Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.<br/>
&gt;      I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some<br/>
&gt;      experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe, I did enjoy the movie personally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter<br/>
&gt;      (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am<br/>
&gt;      rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a<br/>
&gt;      goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Alright, are you a human bard Freeport or Qeynos?  Because my recommendation <br/>
is to hunt in lesser fay and take out Nybrights.  If you are near Qeynos I <br/>
believe they have some bandit camps as well.  The thing that makes them so <br/>
desirable is that they have bronze weapons which are worth 2 plat or so, and <br/>
they provide good experience as you are only 10th lvl.  Generally they are <br/>
camped out in lesser faydark, but I have seen the more mature adventurers <br/>
hunt there who split them evenly with other groups, but expect a long wait <br/>
if a lot of people are there.<br/>
<br/>
