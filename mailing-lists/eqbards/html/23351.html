<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271230658">Galtin - the &quot;Shofar&quot; is an ancient Hebrew instrument made from a Rams Horn.<br/>
It is a precursor to the modern trumpet (or I guess bugle since like early<br/>
trumpets it has no valves).  A part of Modern Jewish religious celebration<br/>
involves sounding the Shofar on the High Holy Days (Rosh Hashana - the<br/>
Jewish New Years and Yom Kippur The Day of Atonement).  In fact - Old<br/>
Testament references to &quot;The sounding of Trumpets&quot; (Numbers etc) would be<br/>
referring to a Shofar.<br/>
<br/>
It would be safe to venture that a Minotaur would have a Horn similar to a<br/>
Ram&#39;s Horn that could be made into an instrument.  So it SHOULD be brass not<br/>
Wind - but it does make sense to be an instrument.<br/>

You forget that you are in Verant&#39;s world now.  The mino horn is a wind<br/>
instrument, not a brass instrument like other typical horns.  Of course<br/>
we&#39;re also talking about a piece of bone that used to stick out of a<br/>
minotaur&#39;s head.  I never understood how it could be considered an<br/>
instrument in the first place seeing that most animal horns are solid mass.<br/>

Isn&#39;t a mino horn a brass instrument?  I saw a bard in my group using a horn<br/>
last night with pixie strike (I play a chanter now).  Am I missing<br/>
something?  Isn&#39;t pixie strike a wind song?  When I used to use it, I used<br/>
my flute until I got a piccolo off that big ugly rockhead in Fear.<br/>
