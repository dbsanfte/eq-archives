<b>Subject:</b> Brahhm&#39;s Horn <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977368626">Does anyone know if this horn (dropped by Brahhm, a rare mino apparently, in<br/>
Beholder) does anything special for bards? (it&#39;s bard only).<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t had a chance to check, since it was my monk that killed Brahhm. :)</div>
