8)* You commented that mules are not approved of by Verant and<br/>
8)may be deleted<br/>
8)if found. Where did you get this info? I have two mule<br/>
8)characters on a<br/>
8)friend&#39;s account (one in Freeport and one in Kelethin) that<br/>
8)exist mostly to<br/>
8)hang onto spell research components, since there are enough<br/>
8)different ones<br/>
8)to fill most of a bank account.  I also use them when I need to give<br/>
8)something to someone but don&#39;t want to hang around waiting<br/>
8)for them -- I&#39;ll<br/>
8)give the item to the holder character, tell the person to let<br/>
8)me know when<br/>
8)they get to the bank, and then log that character in to<br/>
8)transfer the item.<br/>
<br/>
	I think they frown upon a mule that is used to exploit the limited stats<br/>
that we start with. Most prevelent is your main character that you pump up<br/>
the physical or mental stats and a mule with major charisma used solely for<br/>
getting better prices. As far as just having an extra character for storage<br/>
or meeting purposes, I personally don&#39;t see anything wrong with it. Even<br/>
from a roleplay perspective you could consider it as a henchman. You have 8<br/>
character slots on each server after all. (Don&#39;t fill em all up just cause<br/>
you can though! =))<br/>
<br/>
	One thing I recall from MUD days (least the ones I played on) was that they<br/>
busted people who had alts. These systems often had limited resources and<br/>
thus limited player slots. If you had an alt then there was one less person<br/>
out there who couldn&#39;t have a character.<br/>

8)* You commented that twinking is not approved of by Verant<br/>
8)and may result<br/>
8)in character deletion. This is definitely not true. Verant<br/>
8)has said that<br/>
8)they don&#39;t care, and that the game has some balance factors<br/>
8)that prevent<br/>
8)low level characters from gaining huge advantage from powerful items.<br/>
<br/>
	Two versions of twinking. First is the giving of powerful items to very low<br/>
level characters. As you state there are some &#39;proficiency&#39; factors that<br/>
make using these powerful weapons less effective. Second is the practice of<br/>
helping a low level character defeat a mob that is way beyond their level to<br/>
get major experience. I think this is guarded with the grouping exp window<br/>
and a seeming cap on how much experience you can earn in one kill.<br/>
	Verant had an anti-twinking policy during Beta Phase 3 which would call for<br/>
the end of your beta testing if caught. They did this so they could get an<br/>
idea of how the levelling was balanced between the classes. Twinking would<br/>
skew the results.</div>
