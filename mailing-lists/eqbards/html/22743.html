<div id="ygrps-yiv-228943325">If you are intentionally going linkdead to avoid death, I would think that <br/>
was an exploit. Not an exploit of a bug, but an exploit of a built-in safety.<br/>
<br/>
Linkdeath should happen if you accidentally lose your connection to their <br/>
server (either from internet or computer problems). I would think that they <br/>
intentionally put in a 30 second delay so that users didn&#39;t intentionally <br/>
make themselves go linkdead and would die if they tried using it to avoid <br/>
dying in a fight, but would be short enough that if it was a valid linkdead <br/>
situation, you wouldn&#39;t get killed by something that happened to wander up <br/>
to you and/or so that you could get back into the game in a timely manner.<br/>
<br/>
Then this situation is exacerbated by the fact that the person would be <br/>
intentionally turning themselves into an NPC so that they would cast when <br/>
you aren&#39;t even in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand why people would do it, but I would think that if you were <br/>
unable to sit and camp to get out of the situation (or zone) that you <br/>
should probably die. Now of course, that is just my opinion. Any other <br/>
opinions are more than welcome.<br/>

&gt;Sounds to me like an exploit that I wouldn&#39;t care to discuss. :-P<br/>

&gt; &gt;The following happened recently on E&#39;ci.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A group of folks were in the Hole to help someone with their epic quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t know the details of the quest, but you have to talk/give something to<br/>
&gt; &gt;one of the NPCs there.  So a cleric by mistake aggroed the quest NPC.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;the groups killed the mob, they wouldn&#39;t be able to complete that portion<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the quest.  So no one else attacked the NPC while it was beating up on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric.  Since no one else was on the NPC&#39;s hate list, once the cleric died<br/>
&gt; &gt;the NPC would not be aggro anymore and they could finish the quest.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric (59th level with an AC over 1100) thought he might have a chance of<br/>
&gt; &gt;surviving if he went LD.  So he turned on autoattack and then typed in<br/>
&gt;/quit<br/>
&gt; &gt;to go LD.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now here is where the funny part starts.  The cleric had Complete Heal<br/>
&gt; &gt;loaded in the first spell gem.  Apparently when you go linkdead, the game<br/>
&gt; &gt;automatically switches you over to NPC AI.  If you can cast spells,<br/>
&gt; &gt;apparently the only one the AI will cast is whichever one is loaded in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;first spell gem.  So as everyone else watched the NPC beat on the cleric,<br/>
&gt; &gt;every once in a while (when he wasn&#39;t stunned) the cleric was able to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt;CH spell off.  He was able to cast CH enough that he didn&#39;t die before his<br/>
&gt; &gt;character disappeared from the server.  To say the least he was quite<br/>
&gt; &gt;pleased when he discovered he didn&#39;t die after going LD.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge to somehow help<br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt; &gt;survive a fight after we go linkdead.  Fear sounds like a good option but<br/>
&gt; &gt;then again it could potentially screw over the rest of the group by causing<br/>
&gt; &gt;a train.  The new Shield of Songs is a possibility as well.  Third option<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be whatever song that you think would best help your party kill the<br/>
&gt; &gt;mob(s) you were attacking before you went LD.  That would be situationally<br/>
&gt; &gt;dependent on where you were fighting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyone got other suggestions?<br/>
