&gt; This makes no sense at all.  You could equip yourself very similar to the<br/>
&gt; Dwarf for around the same prices.  But just because you bought one piece of<br/>
&gt; rare equipment doesn&#39;t mean that bards are worse off.<br/>

about what level you can hunt in Sol B at, I&#39;d just like to reitertate<br/>
for you Wood Elf bards a point that seems to have been missed. On a<br/>
newer server, small races have access to bronze 10-15 levels before a<br/>
medium race bard has a hope of seeing it. So try to consider that when<br/>
making replies, not everyone&#39;s world is exactly the same as the one you<br/>
live on. Whether you can start hunting in Sol B at 35 or 40, the real<br/>
point is in Unrest you can have a full set of bronze by 24. <br/>
<br/>
Why Verant chose to penalize the medium races this way, I have no idea.<br/>
