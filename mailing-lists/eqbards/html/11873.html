<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066568131">I have been on that death bed more than a few times &lt;g&gt; but we always had<br/>
someone to cure poison for those who got nailed. And when I was there w/o<br/>
the enchanter, I had my hands full keeping multiples pixified - but it would<br/>
be good depending on who else was with you.<br/>
