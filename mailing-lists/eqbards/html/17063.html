<br/>
GRRRRRRRR<br/>
GRRRRRRRR<br/>
<br/>
I probably shouldn&#39;t start this but....  I know many argue that all classes<br/>
should be in lottos.  Or that if the wizard has been there all day he should<br/>
get some right over the warrior who just showed up, etc.  And I know FBSS,<br/>
SMR, Ykesha, M2H are great trade items but COME ON!  I won an fbss with<br/>
Halana and gave it to the ranger who had been camping it for like 2 weeks,<br/>
losing countless lottos to caster classes.  I&#39;m certainly not trying to say<br/>
I&#39;m altruistic but dang, when that dropable shaman belt drops in Hate, I<br/>
want people to say HALANA!!! not keep it for their own trade.<br/>
<br/>
And Bards are kind of left out of the loop even more being the most hybrid<br/>
of the hybrids....I&#39;ve been in lord room lottos where bards were not even<br/>
allowed in the Ykesha lotto because &quot;they don&#39;t need them as much as<br/>
rangers.&#39;  Puuuhhhleeeeeeze.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my feelings on the subject :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Wednesday<br/>

I noticed this also, being a woodelf bard my forage raised to 51. I am very<br/>
pleased as I have got into a habit of pressing forage all the time, the<br/>
higher the skill the more food I&#39;m gonna have  =)<br/>
I only managed to raise the skill to 51 so not sure what it caps at, I&#39;m<br/>
hoping something like 75-80 (100 would be nice). I wonder now if they<br/>
raised any other skill caps in yesterdays patch.<br/>

Ps, Lost a roll on a sash last night, out of the classes that were in the<br/>
group (bard, ranger, monk, wizard, cleric and druid). The wizard won<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;. I rolled a lousy 23 and the wizard got 83.<br/>

Hey all!  Good news for those us who like the Forage skill!  I was happily<br/>
running along today hitting my forage button as I always do, when I go the<br/>
message: You have become better at Forage (41).  Yippeee.  They have raised<br/>
the skill cap on forage.  I had to log out before I found out what the max<br/>
was, but I thought I&#39;d pass that along to you all.<br/>
