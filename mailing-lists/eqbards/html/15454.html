<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659985526">Of course, if you were bright and immoral.. you could simply do this twice, assuming you were group<br/>
leader.  Just make a few macros for some fake seed generations.. just like you would for the roll.<br/>

Cheetr says &#39;Blah, blah...  Here&#39;s the seed..&#39;_______<br/>
Cheetr could have rolled any number from 1 to 1000<br/>
but this time he made sure it was a 378.<br/>

Would be hard to maintain credibility over time, but could certainly be done a few times in a pickup<br/>
group.<br/>

&gt; This is true, and to my knowledge it&#39;s the only way to cheat on a roll.  If<br/>
&gt; Verant hopped the clue train and made the rolls appear in yellow or red<br/>
&gt; there&#39;d be no way to cheat.  As it is, emotes and rolls are the same color.<br/>
&gt; Duh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheetr creates an emote that produces the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheetr says &#39;Blah, blah...  I hope I win.&#39;_______<br/>
&gt; Cheetr could have rolled any number from 1 to 100<br/>
&gt; but this time he made sure it was a 98.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just make double sure that NO ONE in a roll has &quot;said&quot; anything prior to the<br/>
&gt; roll itself.  If anyone has, reroll, perhaps using the method below:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The leader of the group randoms a number 1 to 100 and then the group rolls<br/>
&gt; to that.  That way no one can use the emote cheat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leader rolls 1 to 100 and gets a 43.<br/>
&gt; Everyone else does a /random 1 43 for the winner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem with the 1-6 Alpha method is that if the leader and someone in<br/>
&gt; the group are wooking in cahoots, the randomer could make sure his buddy won<br/>
&gt; the roll for the item that he really wanted.<br/>
