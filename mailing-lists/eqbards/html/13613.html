<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195396325"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jackal@...">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have multiple dungeons. I don&#39;t care for a change of pace all I want is to<br/>
&gt; be less crowded and they can change that with more zones. You guys have<br/>
&gt; so many options of zone that it&#39;s not even funny but lets say for 46+ we have<br/>
&gt; the 3 planes now and sol b and guk. But wait there are people 30+ in guk and<br/>
&gt; sol b. So all we really have is 3 zones. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can still do Permafrost over the Vox&#39;s lair section, plenty of IGs<br/>
to go around<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now for 30ish people you have a variety of outdoor zones, for dungeons you <br/>
&gt; have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A, Guk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the <br/>
&gt; problem? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No I don&#39;t since CT, Unrest, Upper Guk and most of Permafrost greens out<br/>
at the 30s.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I play a mid level char a 50 char and a low level char and there are no <br/>
&gt; problems with the low or mid levle chars. High level chars there is a problem <br/>
&gt; though. It&#39;s not like were complaining we need a change of pace we want <br/>
&gt; something new for the hell of it we don&#39;t but you are. Seriously what problems <br/>
&gt; do you have at mid or low levels? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a far less crowded server then most (peak last Sat night was 1921<br/>
people) but the over crowding is felt down at the lower levels just as<br/>
much as at the higher ones. And because the crowding is so bad, all<br/>
those 45+ players with nothing to do are creating new characters just so<br/>
they can have something to do. So the problem has trickled down quite<br/>
nicely so it really has affected us all. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded. Hell I love the lower guk<br/>
&gt; zone and I&#39;d be happy if they just duplicated the zone a bunch of times. <br/>
&gt; Seriously though how about you list me a couple of problems you low mid levels<br/>
&gt; have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On my server, Lower is always packed.  But then again, isn&#39;t most of<br/>
Lower Guk green for you also; much like MM is? So it&#39;s not really about<br/>
xp, it&#39;s about loot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Dean_Kimes@...">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the area of zones. Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill. Mistmoore is<br/>
&gt; too deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>
&gt; frequently to make the entry area safe. Unrest is packed, last three times I was<br/>
&gt; there there were 50+ people in them. Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond<br/>
&gt; my groups ability at 21-24. Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>
&gt; difficulty but there was no way before. Befallen is also fairly<br/>
&gt; crowded and most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow. Tried<br/>
&gt; hunting skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well. Went<br/>
&gt; to S Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny  I found the early 20s very frustrating with my ranger and now<br/>
with my bard as well.<br/>
<br/>
MM- you need a full group at the early 20s. Stay on the wall by the<br/>
lake.<br/>
Permafrost- get a group and work the entrance only.  <br/>
Everfrost- You can try doing Icy Orcs but the site always camped and the<br/>
spawn rate is too slow to really make it worthwhile.<br/>
Upper Guk is nice for early 20s as long as you don&#39;t mind ruining your<br/>
Froglock faction.<br/>
Befallen- this dungeon will green out for your group in a couple of<br/>
levels but bottom floor is still good _if_ it&#39;s not camped all to hell<br/>
by farmers.<br/>
<br/>
These are places you can try. Forget Unrest and Aviaks as those spawns<br/>
are just too flipping full already<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The group my bard plays with though has so little downtime that <br/>
&gt; we waste a lot of time when we are fully capable of knocking <br/>
&gt; something off, only there isn&#39;t anything available. That <br/>
&gt; frustration has cost me more guildmates than I care to think about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the failure of the high level characters to understand the plight of<br/>
the mid level characters has caused more guilds to explode then I care<br/>
to mention.  It can be heartbreaking to watch.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Its really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane<br/>
&gt; of sky when quests are my favorite part of the game.  Lame as many of them<br/>
&gt; are they are still more fun than camping.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The quests are my favorite parts of the game too.  If it were not for<br/>
them and a very small handful of wonderful people on my server, I&#39;d have<br/>
left the game long ago.<br/>
