<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] A possible way to make Disarm Traps useful? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994263865">I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m following you completely.  So these ornate boxes would<br/>
be loot on mobs?  And only a rogue/bard can open them?  Or would it be more<br/>
accurate to say only a rogue or bard can open them safely?  And if anyone<br/>
can open them, but risks being  poisoned/stabbed/zapped/turned into a<br/>
newt/etc then would someone with invulernabilty or high poison/magic resists<br/>
be able to escape harm?  Also, could players carry these around like<br/>
backpacks for their loot?  (yeah, I know, wicked heavy for such use.  But<br/>
I&#39;m thinking in terms protecting valuables on PvP servers)<br/>
<br/>
I think I like this idea.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The idea is fairly simple. Start off by making an item called <br/>
&gt; An Ornate Box.<br/>
&gt; If you examine it it appears to be a container with 4 slots <br/>
&gt; that weighs 5.0<br/>
&gt; lbs. If you click on it to open it however instead of opening <br/>
&gt; it casts a<br/>
&gt; spell like a magic item. The spell is cast on the holder of <br/>
&gt; the item and<br/>
&gt; could be a poison DoT, a lightning DD, or whatever trap you like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The change to Disarm traps would be to allow the item to make <br/>
&gt; a check on<br/>
&gt; Disarm Traps when attempting to open it. If the skill check <br/>
&gt; is a success<br/>
&gt; then the trapped chest is replaced with a different item that <br/>
&gt; represents the<br/>
&gt; treasure inside, much in the fashion of the Combine button <br/>
&gt; changing the item<br/>
&gt; combined into a new one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This should be a feasible solution to making Disarm Traps <br/>
&gt; useful, and would<br/>
&gt; no doubt greatly increase the call for rogues since only they <br/>
&gt; and high level<br/>
&gt; bards could open these mysterious treasure boxes. </span></blockquote></div>
