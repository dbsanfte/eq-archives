<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427723309">So, on looking over the new song descriptions at EQVault, saw how the author<br/>
continuously pointed out that resistances are non-functioning.  Dang.  And I<br/>
know I have seen the message, &quot;you resist,&quot; and it certainly did seem like<br/>
the songs of resistance didn&#39;t do anything anyway (but to be honest I don&#39;t<br/>
see how I swing more often juggling Anthem and Whistling with a burst of<br/>
Bellow thrown in).<br/>
<br/>
Fighting drakes, I always sung Elemental Rhythms, guess I was just wasting<br/>
my time.  What a let-down, and I never would have noticed!  Seemed like it<br/>
helped once in a while--probably just luck.  A placebo song!<br/>
