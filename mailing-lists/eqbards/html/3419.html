HighKeep!  Guess I fergot to get rebinded in Qeynos after adventuring.<br/>

		I KNOW why only some classes can bind - and I have no<br/>
problem with that,<br/>
		even though ours is not one of them, that is not the<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
		What I want to know is WHY can&#39;t someone bind me anywhere<br/>
THEY can be bound?<br/>
<br/>
		Yeah, yeah - I can run really fast - a trip across 5 zones<br/>
shouldn&#39;t bother<br/>
		me, well, guess what, it does.</div>
