<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127203497">Thanks everyone for all the input.  I now have a couple of goals for the<br/>
near term (it&#39;s much more fun to play when you have some objective). <br/>
First I&#39;ll concentrate on getting level 8 (I&#39;m halfway there now), then<br/>
I&#39;ll head over to either Queynos or Kelethin (from Freeport) to get the<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lament song.  I&#39;ve travelled to Kelethin many times to sell<br/>
small patchwork.  It&#39;s a pretty easy, but very boring, trip.  That boat<br/>
trip is a killer.  First wait up to 20 minutes for the boat, then<br/>
another 20 riding the boat.  What fun.  With Selo&#39;s is travelling to<br/>
Queynos a better or worse plan?  I have maps, but I&#39;ve never actually<br/>
made the trip.  I&#39;m only familiar with the area from West Karanas to<br/>
Queynos.  I&#39;ve thought about doing a poor man&#39;s gate to get back.  Put<br/>
all my stuff in the bank and then commit suicide.  (Isn&#39;t reincarnation<br/>
great?)<br/>
<br/>
Once I have lament, I&#39;ll try to join some orc camping parties in East<br/>
Commonlands.  I joined my first party a couple of nights ago and had a<br/>
blast, although I died a lot.  I got the distinct feeling that the orcs<br/>
hated me the most when I had my drum equipped, whether I was playing or<br/>
not.  Perhaps it was just my imagination or a conincidence.<br/>
<br/>
Now the hard thing will be balancing the need to save money for a<br/>
combine weapon and using money to build up my smithing skills (lvl 43<br/>
right now).  I really want to be a master smith too, which is why I<br/>
chose to start in Freeport.  I think I&#39;ll go the route of the smith,<br/>
then once I can make/sell banded I can buy the combine weapon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look for JxJerrilia tomorrow afternoon at Jackalstock.  Although I did<br/>
not know Jx, I&#39;m happy to pay him tribute, and I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
meeting other bards.  I hope to see you there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jerrilia, bard of the 7th song.</div>
