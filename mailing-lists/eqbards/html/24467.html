<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178563045">I think the summoning rule is different in Velious than Kunark and Old World<br/>
Zones.  In those zones I&#39;ve never been summoned unless I&#39;ve done melee<br/>
damage.  I&#39;m about 90 percent sure that doing Chants I&#39;ve never been<br/>
summoned.<br/>
<br/>
I had the same experience with Gorenaire that Darkfox had in the early days<br/>
of Velious when one of the Xegony larger guilds had unsuccessfully attacked<br/>
Gorenaire.  She has a Huge aggro range and simply being negative faction is<br/>
enough to get on the Hate list.<br/>

Slight clarification to 1.<br/>
<br/>
You, personally, don&#39;t have to do damage to a creature to be<br/>
summoned.  The creature just has to have been damaged.  I tested this<br/>
recently with another Bard while testing out some theories on beating<br/>
Gorenaire. :)<br/>
<br/>
What this means, tho, is that if someone trains you with their half<br/>
dead mob, you may have a hard time getting away.  Good thing is, it<br/>
will probably require them being summoned and killed first, before<br/>
you&#39;ll be at the top of the Hate list. :)<br/>
