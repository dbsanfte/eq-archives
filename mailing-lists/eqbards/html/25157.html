This should be rather interesting.  Powerlevel a char up on a secondary<br/>
account, transfer to a friend that is too slow leveling or something...<br/>
Wonder how big an impact this will be to the community.  Hmm have a friend<br/>
who quit and doesnt have the heart to start over, no problem, transfer him<br/>
one of your old characters...<br/>
<br/>
&#39;nuff said<br/>
