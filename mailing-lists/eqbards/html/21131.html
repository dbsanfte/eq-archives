<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230740320">I agree with Blitz here.  I am quickly approaching planes level (got 39 and<br/>
40 this weekend...).<br/>
<br/>
On veeshan, (as far as I know) Fear is always broken.  We have a VERY high<br/>
Japanese population so our server population doesnt have the down time/ peak<br/>
time swings in server population you see most places.<br/>
<br/>
No one in my guild has ever been to the planes (our cleric is 46, I think he<br/>
is the first to hit the level).  We would like to adventure in the planes<br/>
and get planes equipment.  I don&#39;t see whats wrong with that.</div>
