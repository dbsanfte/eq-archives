I have all but given up on getting Coralyn&#39;s drum. We have hunted this area <br/>
for about 8 levels and seen her pop but never with the drum. I&#39;m beginning <br/>
to wonder how many shark hammers it will take to trade for a Selo&#39;s drum. <br/>
We&#39;ve seen almost all the other drops, the rares from Estrella and Undertow, <br/>
but not Coralyn.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said the Singing steel gloves have EB. Is it like having a fishbone <br/>
or do you have to activate it like Jboots, Masks?<br/>
