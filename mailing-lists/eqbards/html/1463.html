<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572461713">You can go to the Aviak village south of Paw to unload loot.  <br/>
On the very top of the village there is a named Aviak who<br/>
will buy stuff.<br/>

&gt; Finally got to Paw last night...on Cazic its a bit crowded right now,<br/>
&gt; but late in the evening people start packing it in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Musil - you&#39;re right - plenty of good loot, and that&#39;s just on the<br/>
&gt; guards and shaman so far.  I&#39;m level 12 so perhaps I can zoom here<br/>
&gt; quickly.  Only one problem:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The named centaur Dudley mentioned I couldn&#39;t find!  Checked all the<br/>
&gt; centaurs in the camp, none had names on them.  It isn&#39;t much to speed<br/>
&gt; over to N. Karana and the gypsy camp, but a closer merchant would be<br/>
&gt; sweeter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else run into this Centaur merchant before?  Does he move from<br/>
&gt; the town?<br/>

&gt; &gt; A bonus related to Paw is you don&#39;t have to go far to sell your loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a Centaur camp in S Karana and in one of the houses there<br/>
&gt; resides a<br/>
&gt; &gt; named Centaur who also doubles as a merchant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure if the named Aviak in the South West corner of the zone<br/>
&gt; sells<br/>
&gt; &gt; too - he doesn&#39;t like me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The centaur camp is roughly in the north east part of the S Karanas zone<br/>
&gt; -<br/>
&gt; &gt; turn left when you come OFF the bridge and head inland slightly, should<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it after a couple of minutes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         My friends . . . many of you are asking for great places to<br/>
&gt; hunt, and so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; woulod like to make a single recommendatin that I KNOW will work.<br/>
&gt; Starting<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Level 12, go to Paw. You won&#39;t regret it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         I got enough loot AND experience there (at the same time) to<br/>
&gt; stay there<br/>
&gt; &gt; from Level 13 to until I got Level 19. And on Fenin Ro there is NEVER<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone there (2 people at 8:00 in the evening one night, amazing).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Before I describe the place let me just say that I finished my<br/>
&gt; banded set<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Level 14, and finished my bronze platemail set at Level 18. I bought<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; first combine longsword at Level 15, and my second at Level 17. I still<br/>
&gt; &gt; have 200 plat left over.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         And this was all solo . . .<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Buy about 4 backpacks, you&#39;ll need them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Paw is the home of the Splitpaw Gnolls. You can find it by<br/>
&gt; heading<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly south when you cross into S Karana from the Bridge from N<br/>
&gt; Karana.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You will in time see hills and some rock spires that look like a Paw.<br/>
&gt; There<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a cave which leads to the zone entrance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         At the entrance you will find Gnolls. Probably Level 8-10 or so.<br/>
&gt; Most will<br/>
&gt; &gt; ignore you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Eventually you will meet guards . . . which you can easily solo,<br/>
&gt; and for<br/>
&gt; &gt; good exp. They are level 10-12 maybe. They may have cloth armor. Keep<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They may have rusty weapons. Get used to destroying them, not worth<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; weight.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         You will also find Shamans. These are pretty weak, also about<br/>
&gt; level 10-12.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They carry much better loot. Keep gems, they are lightweight and<br/>
&gt; valuable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The wooden totems sell for a plat a piece. The only weapon you should<br/>
&gt; keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the occasional cracked staff, which also sell for 1 plat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Eventually, you will be able to take nobles. They are Level<br/>
&gt; 13-15. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; carry cloth, gems, but also Snakeskin Armor, which sells for about 7<br/>
&gt; plat<br/>
&gt; &gt; for each piece to other players.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         After that, you will find there are two big rooms which are<br/>
&gt; often camped<br/>
&gt; &gt; and which you should camp if you can. One room has three nobles, one<br/>
&gt; &gt; Captain (Level 16) and High Shaman Lenrel (Level 16 or 17). Lenrel<br/>
&gt; carries<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Runed Totem Staff sometimes. Those sell for about 30 plat to other<br/>
&gt; &gt; players. The other room has two nobles, three commanders (Level 15 or<br/>
&gt; 16),<br/>
&gt; &gt; and High Shaman Ren&#39;Rex. Rex also drops a staff from time to time.<br/>
&gt; Captains<br/>
&gt; &gt; and commanders drop snakeskin often.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Use your lull song ALL the time. There is a place with 4 shamans<br/>
&gt; and 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; guards that I basically lived for two levels. I would lull up to 4 of em<br/>
&gt; &gt; and take the other two one at a time. Worked great.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         The real kicker? Gnolls hate water. They won&#39;t swim after you to<br/>
&gt; try to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill you. And almost everywhere is close enough to water to get there<br/>
&gt; &gt; before you die. So trouble does not mean death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         There are some other secret places, and other things you will<br/>
&gt; figure out<br/>
&gt; &gt; (some monk quests as well). But this should be good enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Oh, and get used to being encumbered. Yes you can carry about 50<br/>
&gt; over your<br/>
&gt; &gt; weight limit and still win every fight again things that con blue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;         Good luck!<br/>
