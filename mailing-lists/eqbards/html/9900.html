<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589071488">To get to the King room where the icy greaves drop, you go thru some halls<br/>
off the Flag room.  There is this set of iron bars you need to raise to go<br/>
thru and right there - i swear to the Gods that they have it drop your invis<br/>
- on purpose!  There can be one or two gobs who went agro on me - maybe<br/>
there was one and he ran and got his buddy - but thank the Gods there were<br/>
2. I charmed one and made them fite.  I dont think i could have taken one by<br/>
myself in a pure melee. And the fear of a train had me real scared. I really<br/>
really hate getting killed by greenies.<br/>
<br/>
So my advice to you is try to tag along with a group going in and out.<br/>

I am headed tonight to get the Icy Greaves from Permafrost. Then to Unrest<br/>
and Castle Mistmoore for<br/>
the other items.<br/>
<br/>
I am only level 21 but my Invis worked great in Upper Guk. Is the same true<br/>
for getting to the<br/>
proper room in Permafrost? I know it is not in the undead areas but I have<br/>
to try them to.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or help on how to acquire these would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
