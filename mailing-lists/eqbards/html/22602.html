<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116510703">**i think it is 75%.  i get +120 to resists with psalms (this singing<br/>
**increase<br/>
**is almost certainly an oversight and will be fixed) and i think they **do <br/>
upper 60s normally, so something like 68 to 120 is 75%.  good luck **on the <br/>
scale.  all 3 times we killed gorenarire she had a scale, **phew.  one for <br/>
each bard in the guild =)<br/>

**Shada, new owner of dragon claw main gauche AND veldrak&#39;s  <br/>
**shortsword...which do i use!?<br/>

Heheh not sure if you know this, but Gorenaire has yet to die on Veeshan. I <br/>
took part in 2 failed attempts with FoH, and know of at least 3 other tries. <br/>
This was pre-fear fix I think, not sure. This is why I&#39;ve been doing Vox a <br/>
lot, but she hasn&#39;t been putting out. My guild alone is too small to handle <br/>
Gorenaire, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, main gauche is sweet. I have the pre-patch Crysanthemum Katana, which <br/>
is nothing special. Kinda pissed at Verant for not retroing the VP loot <br/>
changes, but I did get a Claw of Phara Dar last time he died. I think I&#39;d <br/>
rather have the gauche as I try to avoid offensive proccers, but that&#39;s just <br/>
me.<br/>
