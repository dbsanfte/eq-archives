<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find it interesting that you like to be among the highest-ranked in<br/>
&gt; the group.  I&#39;m exactly the opposite.  I much prefer to be one of the<br/>
&gt; lowest-ranked.  Yeah, I&#39;m weaker, it&#39;s much easier for the MOBs to<br/>
&gt; kill me, and it&#39;s much harder to run, but it seems to me that they<br/>
&gt; target me a LOT less.  Whenever I&#39;m among the highest-ranked,<br/>
&gt; I get pounded incessantly.  I&#39;m curious how others feel about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s odd. I have found it exactly the opposite. The &quot;younger&quot; I am,<br/>
level-wise in the group, the more the mobs run straight for me and start<br/>
&quot;chewing on me&quot; (to quote my husband) whether I&#39;m playing a song or not.<br/>
When I&#39;ve been in the middle or higher end of the group, it hasn&#39;t been so<br/>
much the case, although, as we all expect, they don&#39;t like me healing party<br/>
members... at least that&#39;s what my experience has been thus far.<br/>
