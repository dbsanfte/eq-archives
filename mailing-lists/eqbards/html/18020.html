<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039425808">Actually Highkeep is notorious for attracting &quot;dumb players&quot; or rather it<br/>
creates them.<br/>
<br/>
The total safety of the hunting there causes people to learn terrible group<br/>
tactics (or not learn any at all).<br/>
<br/>
99% of the time if I find myself grouped with someone who levelled through<br/>
their upper 20&#39;s and lower 30&#39;s in highkeep I immediately leave the group.<br/>
It&#39;s not that ALL people who played there are bad, it&#39;s that most are.<br/>
<br/>
No offense to anyone who&#39;s hunted there religiously but HK just isn&#39;t the<br/>
same as SolA or GukTop or Cazic.<br/>

&gt; Hehehe - what is it about Highkeep that attracts dumb bards?  Back when I<br/>
&gt; was hunting there - I got into a big argument with about Jig and Mana<br/>
Regen.<br/>
&gt; And this was RIGHT after GZ posted the note that Jig.  I pointed that out<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the guy and he said &quot;Verant&#39;s is wrong - I know I tested it&quot;...<br/>

&gt; &gt; was that he was using a PGT and barbed whip at 30, but hey, sometimes<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; just like a certain combo. It was when he said &quot;I will sing Hymn and<br/>
Jig&quot;<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought &quot;uh oh.&quot; But I really wanted a group...I died shortly<br/>
thereafter,<br/>
&gt; &gt; however the rest of the evening went smoothly. BTW, his name makes it on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; silly name list but I think I better not mention it :o)<br/>
