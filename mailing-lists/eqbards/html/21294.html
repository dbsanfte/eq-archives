release?  Based on what I read, if they don&#39;t get the funding the project<br/>
will fall through, which will be a shame based on the promise of this game.<br/>

<br/>
After having a lengthy discussion with two of the folks from Artifact<br/>
Entertainment (Horizons) over the Labor Day weekend, I can see a night and<br/>
day difference in their approach as opposed to Verant.  Both David Allen,<br/>
the president and CEO, and Doug Shuler, the art director and visual<br/>
designer, were extremely personable and open to suggestions from those in<br/>
attendance.  Having known Doug personally for several years, I am confident<br/>
this was not a put on to garner interest.  Both were praiseful of much that<br/>
Verant has accomplished, but both were also equally horrified and confused<br/>
over the way Verant treats its customers.  It was that treatment, over and<br/>
above everything else that inspired them to go out and put together a team<br/>
to make a game that was willing to treat its players the way they wanted to<br/>
see them treated.  I hope they get it right.<br/>
