&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I was not implying that.  Instead, I was throwing out the<br/>
possibility that EXP is a graphical representation from the outset.  In<br/>
Wayne&#39;s post, he used a standard 500 EXP loss per death. Variations in the<br/>
amount your EXP bar drops is due to the amount of total EXP required to<br/>
complete that level.  What I was saying is that instead of a constant<br/>
numerical value for EXP loss (based on your level), the game instead applies<br/>
a constant number of pixels that you lose on the EXP bar.  Lets say it takes<br/>
20 pixels to fill up one bub on the EXP bar.  A death in a regular level<br/>
results in a loss of 10 pixels (1/2 bar).  A death in a hell level results<br/>
in a loss of 5 pixels (1/4 bar).  A death in a hell+1 level results in a<br/>
loss of 20 pixels (full bar).  <br/>
<br/>
	My next suggestion was that when you die in a hell+1 level and drop<br/>
down to a hell level, the number of pixels you lose is based on what level<br/>
you started out in.  You just made 31st and die.  Game determines you lose<br/>
20 pixels.  That puts you back to 30 with a full bub required to get back to<br/>
31st.  If you were at 30th with only a pixel left to make 31 and you die,<br/>
game determines you only lose 5 pixels.  End result is that the penalty for<br/>
dying at 31st and dropping to 30 is four times more severe than if you were<br/>
30th and just about to level. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The most obvious explanation is sloppy coding by Verant.  Instead of using<br/>
&gt; hard numbers for EXP loss, its possible Verant uses a graphical<br/>
&gt; representation instead.  For example, you just made 31st when you die.<br/>
&gt; Using Wayne&#39;s numbers below, you are supposed to lose 500 EXP pts<br/>
&gt; (500/1000=20%= a full bub on the bar).  But its possible the game doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use hard numbers and instead says you lose a full bub on the bar (when you<br/>
&gt; die in hell+1) and then calculates how many EXP points you need to lose in<br/>
&gt; order to graphically drop a full bub.  Since you just made 31st, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a full bar&#39;s worth of pixels built up on the EXP bar so you lose a<br/>
&gt; level.  Here is where the sloppy coding comes into play.  Instead of<br/>
&gt; applying the hell level rule (1/4 bub using Wayne&#39;s numbers), it applies<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; hell+1 rule EXP (one full bub).  So now you are back at 30th level with a<br/>
&gt; full bub to get 31st back.  End result is that instead of losing 500 EXP<br/>
&gt; pts<br/>
&gt; (one full bub at 31st level), you lost 2000 EXP pts (one full bub at 30th<br/>
&gt; level).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think this explains what happened to John.  But its making my head hurt<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m through with trying to figure it out.  I&#39;m just gonna take John&#39;s<br/>
&gt; advice<br/>
&gt; from a long time ago and 1) don&#39;t die when your in a hell+1 level and 2)<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; you do die in a hell+1 level, make sure you have a full bub buffer before<br/>
&gt; you do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This only fits part of the puzzle though.  It does not explain why you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; lose more of level 30 when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; die after JUST reaching 31, then you do if you simply die at level 30.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of the people who run ShowEQ have been trying to come up with an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience formula.  They have come up with some formulas that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain much of the hell level and hell level +1 effects.  Based on<br/>
&gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; formulas (which are only a guess) I think the difference in experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; loss<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be explained.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl, exp needed, exp lost  (examples made up)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl 29    5000    500<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl 30    10000   500<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lvl 31    2500    500<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level takes a big jump, and there is a dip afterwards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A death at 31 costs you a full bubble.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But the total experience loss is the same in each case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (based on the made of example above)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since experience for HL+1 is so much less than HL, the same amount of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience loss will result in a bigger percentage of the bar.  You<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really losing that much more experience numerically, but just<br/>
&gt; &gt; graphically.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You can test this yourself by measuring how long it takes to make up<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; death in HL vs HL+1.  The time to regain the lost experience should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; roughly equal, therefore the loss is roughly equal.  Your bar dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in HL+1, but you regain it faster.<br/>
