<div id="ygrps-yiv-293097028">I know I hunted wisps every opportunity I had. If I remember <br/>
correctly, I could start to handle one at around 8th or 9th level, but then <br/>
could grab 3 of them before I outgrew them around 14th or so. Good <br/>
experience, great loot (especially when combined with the gypsy quests in <br/>
Oasis or NK). In East Antonica the best place to nab them is in the Commons, <br/>
particularly EC. In the Western portion, the best place to hunt for wisps is <br/>
on that island as you head toward Erudin.<br/>
       I remember cranking out around 400pp or more just from woprking the <br/>
wisps. Not bad for under 20th level. In addition, Greater Light Stones were <br/>
only going for around 5 or 6pp on my server, so I bought all that I could <br/>
when I took my trips to the gypsies. I made a nice profit, established some <br/>
nice business contacts, and picked up some extra experience in the process.<br/>
