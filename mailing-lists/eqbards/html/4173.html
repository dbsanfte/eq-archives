<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265561967">This is a post I made on EQVault about places to hunt and being crowded.<br/>
Some will think this as spoiler information, so if you do I will leave some<br/>
space.  Hopefully people will add to this.  This is for low to mid 20&#39;s.<br/>

I have been to every zone except Solusek A and B, Kedge Keep and the Red<br/>
Dragon&#39;s Lair. This is what I have found...<br/>
<br/>
All times are peak times on a weeknight.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost: 18-22 people. Ok loot, but need a full party because you get<br/>
swarmed. It is dangerous for low 20&#39;s because of this fact.<br/>
<br/>
Cazic-Thule: 70+ people. Great loot, but even with a full party this place<br/>
is hell on Norrath (unless you make straight for the bottom of the temple<br/>
with invis where the trains won&#39;t come). This has got to be Grand Central<br/>
Station of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest: 70+ people. Good loot, easy to work from edges and pull from inside.<br/>
Trains are usually manageable (or you can get away if you have SoW).<br/>
<br/>
Najena: 15-20 people. Okay loot, easy in most areas. At low 20&#39;s keep away<br/>
from the high camped areas (Najena, Drezlna, and Bonecrusher).<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore: 20-30 people. Great loot for the brave, but also death for the<br/>
brave too. At low 20&#39;s you should stick to the familiars outside and by the<br/>
graveyard. I made the mistake of investigating a tunnel. When I turned<br/>
around and headed back to the zone I was backstabbed for 170 damage.<br/>
<br/>
Upper Guk: Good experience, good loot. Actually went here at high teens. The<br/>
trains can be deadly at times, and if you don&#39;t know the way to the zone its<br/>
pretty much a slow and agonizing death. Need a full group and someone that<br/>
can root (ensnare is even better as they don&#39;t fight back when they are<br/>
ensnared.) Never fight something if you don&#39;t have to without being full on<br/>
mana and health. A simple kill can turn into a cluster*#&$@ very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some outside areas. The reason the loot isn&#39;t as good is because<br/>
the risk is not as great. SoW and accelerando works outdoors, and you don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about getting lost (too much).<br/>
<br/>
South Karana: Good experience, so-so loot. <br/>
<br/>
High Hold Pass: If you don&#39;t have a wizard in your group, forgot about it.<br/>
The general rule in High Hold is &#39;He who has the power gets the kill&#39;. There<br/>
is no sharing here that I have seen. I usually avoid it except for an<br/>
occasional gnoll getting in my way.<br/>
<br/>
East Karana: Great for levels from 16-20. Creatures that poison and that<br/>
require magic to hit give MORE experience than things that do not.<br/>
Significantly. Lower 20&#39;s you want two on one against Crag spiders. Ok loot.<br/>
A group of 4 low 20&#39;s or 2 mid 20&#39;s can kill Broon the cyclops. No loot to<br/>
speak of but good experience and bragging rights.<br/>
<br/>
Everfrost Peaks: An occasional Snow Orc at this level is about the only<br/>
thing you want for experience, and not much. Good money from other things<br/>
though....<br/>
<br/>
Nektulous Forest: On this side of the bridge attack the guards (greens and<br/>
yellows). If you see a Dragoon, don&#39;t ask questions just head for the zone.<br/>
Also not a good solo situation as the guards have a high range of visibility<br/>
and they gang up on you. SoW is pretty much required if you don&#39;t want to<br/>
die.<br/>
<br/>
Ocean of Tears: Investigate the islands. Good experience on most.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
