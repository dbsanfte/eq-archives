<div id="ygrps-yiv-89288450"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; About a year ago or so - I did some research on video cards - and people<br/>
&gt; told me that TNT2 and better video cards -- with a processor speed of less<br/>
&gt; than 400 Mhz (I have a p2 300) you wouldn&#39;t see any improvement over a TNT<br/>
&gt; or a Voodoo3.  I got a Voodoo 3 2000 real cheap -so I stuck with that.<br/>
&gt;  BTW - I&#39;m oversimplifying what they said and these WERE people who knew<br/>
&gt; what they are talking about...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone upgraded a Pentium II box ~300 Mhz to GeForce from a Voodoo3?<br/>
&gt; Did they see a significant improvement?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t upgraded one but yes, upgrading any system from a Voodoo3 to a<br/>
GeForce will show an improvement, especially on older systems.  This is<br/>
because the GeForce doesn&#39;t have the processor as a bottleneck because it<br/>
has it&#39;s own on-board processor that handles the video _instead_ of the CPU.<br/>
That is the big advantage of a GeForce over 3dFX technology.<br/>
<br/>
The GeForce is doing the Processor&#39;s job.  So not only will your video speed<br/>
up on sub 500mhz systems but your processor will have less workload to keep<br/>
track of...  As stated before on a PIII 500+ system you start to see<br/>
diminishing returns because Intel&#39;s SSE technology or AMD&#39;s 3d NOW!<br/>
technology does the same job as the GeForce&#39;s on board processor and takes<br/>
no performance hit from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Basically - I&quot;m holding out till fall or so to upgrade - and figured I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; just sit with what I have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If what you have is working then you really don&#39;t _need_ to upgrade.  But<br/>
the difference you would notice for your system would be... to put it<br/>
midly... incredible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another question - how many games actually use 32-bti video?  I thought it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t supportred in DX7?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I THINK... don&#39;t quote me on this I&#39;m not at home so I cant check my specs:<br/>
<br/>
Quake 3 arena<br/>
Unreal Tournament<br/>
Asheron&#39;s Call (I THINK they support 32 bit color)<br/>
Most 3D Racing Games<br/>
<br/>
Also key to note:  Most, if not all, new games coming out from now on will<br/>
more than likely support 32 bit Color.  The only reason they weren&#39;t before<br/>
was because nobody but TNT supported it.  Now several new technologies are<br/>
supporting it.  As far as I&#39;m aware, 3dFX is the only graphics platform<br/>
going to Generation 3 without 32 bit color.<br/>
<br/>
Again:<br/>
<br/>
If what you are using works and you don&#39;t have any problem using it, then do<br/>
not upgrade until you upgrade your system.  There&#39;s no need to rush out and<br/>
buy a card that you don&#39;t _need_ just because others are ;)<br/>
