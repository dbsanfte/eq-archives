<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930610494">ok, how many people out of the total subscribers play bards?  by the numbers<br/>
posted here, less than 5%.  by your argument, then bards and their issues are <br/>
insignificant because less than 5% of the people who play everquest are affected.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s only insignificant if you&#39;re not the one it&#39;s affecting.<br/>
