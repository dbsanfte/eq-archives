<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306664282">This issue has been a bone of contention with me for a good while now.<br/>
I still find it hard to understand the &quot;balance&quot; that comes from giving<br/>
classes that can SoW and/or gate (which would get them back to whatever zone<br/>
they died in that much faster) the ability to bind themselves anywhere while<br/>
classes that have no similar speed-up factors (except for bards) are forced<br/>
to lumber there way (through up to three or four zones from the nearest bind<br/>
point) all the way back to their corpse.  Not only that, but when a caster<br/>
comes back from death, they have their primary weapons/defense with them...<br/>
their spells and the mana that powers them.  Warriors, on the other hand are<br/>
weaponless and armor-less until they loot their corpses.<br/>
     One of the points that Brad & Co. love to constantly toss out is that<br/>
if all folks were able to be bound in any zone, this would create an<br/>
imbalance in the game where folks could fight something, get killed by it,<br/>
run right back to their corpses, loot, then kill whatever it was while it&#39;s<br/>
hps are still low.<br/>
     ...What!?!<br/>
     Considering (especially at the higher levels, which is who they are<br/>
afraid of doing this the most) the amount of experience one looses when they<br/>
die versus the amount you could get from any creature you could possibly do<br/>
this to, a person would loose MUCH more experience than they could gain.<br/>
Not only that, but if this were able to happen, why don&#39;t you see newbs<br/>
doing this in the newb zones?  Sure, they take on things that could most<br/>
likely kill them with reckless abandon, but that is because the exp loss at<br/>
those levels is so low, not because of binding (the only time binding<br/>
becomes an issue at those levels is when said newb is far, far from their<br/>
bind-point, and hasn&#39;t been re-bound).  At higher levels, having to run from<br/>
zone-to-zone-to-zone is more of an annoyance than a deterrent to dieing.<br/>
The experience loss is the deterrent.<br/>
     Another thing that I&#39;ve noticed lately is more and more posts from Brad<br/>
& Co. wondoering how-oh-how they can get more folks to spread out into the<br/>
less-crowded zones.  DUH!  Letting all classes be bound in all zones would<br/>
be one heckuva good starting spot.  Other ideas?  Faster MOB-spawns and more<br/>
solo-able MOBs for all levels in the farther out zones (how often do you<br/>
find the hermit in South Karana uncamped?)<br/>
     Bah!  I could go on and on about this, but I have things to do ;o)~<br/>

&gt;This is a repost of something I posted to the GZ questions thread.<br/>
&gt;I think we should be re-classed as casters, much like Shamans and Clerics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Comments?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Feel free to burn me at the stake for being a heretic, but some good<br/>
 </span></blockquote>logical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;responses would be nice as well :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;----------------------------------<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to pitch in my two coppers on the Binding Issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I understand that the Dev Team feels that the current bind status (Hybrids<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Melee classes don&#39;t get it) is unlikely to change and is well balanced.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;most part I agree.  However, I&#39;d like to argue that the Bard shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;classed as a Hybrid.  Sound crazy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hybrids are Warrior/Pure Caster combos.  They get some melee skills in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>addition<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to the spells from a specific casting class.  IE Rangers get Warrior skills<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Druid spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our spells are unique in that they may mimic some existing spells, but they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not come from any particular casting class.  We are a casting class unto<br/>
&gt;ourselves with completely different spells and casting structure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To be a Hybrid you must be part Melee class (Warrior, or in our case Rogue)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;part caster.  We&#39;ve got the caster part down, but where is the Melee part?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;get Plate, but so do Clerics.  Everyone gets Dodge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you skip dodge, what Melee skills do the Hybrids get?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ranger - (7) Kick, Taunt, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Disarm, Riposte<br/>
&gt;Paladin- (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Riposte, Disarm<br/>
&gt;SK - (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Reposte, Disarm<br/>
&gt;Bard - (1) Dual Wield<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, the other Hybrids really are part fighter and part caster.  In what way<br/>
 </span></blockquote>does<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ONE melee skill make us part fighter?  In addition, all other Hybrids get<br/>
&gt;Archery except Bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I fail to see how we can be classed as Hybrids at all, and feel that the<br/>
&gt;addition of a personal Bind song to be in line with the current Bind<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thinking.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If we&#39;re to have the disadvantages of a Melee Hybrid, shouldn&#39;t we get the<br/>
&gt;skills to compensate? If not, shouldn&#39;t we get the pure caster perks?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far, we have a stick with 2 short ends :)  Thanks for the time...<br/>
