<b>Subject:</b> Proper way to use Lucid Lullaby <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-953939302">Hi fellow mistrels and other friends,<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have never really figured out how to use the lullably song correctly.  I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it might be best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter.  I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is an area effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>
