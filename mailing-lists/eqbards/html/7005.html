damage I do (probably 30% of that is due to double attack, the<br/>
rest due to stat bonuses/modifiers).  And our defensive skills<br/>
are a joke compared to theirs.  Clerics are almost our<br/>
defensive equivalent.  Their melee skill is weaker (4 pts/lvl<br/>
vs our 5 pts/lvl + dual wield), but their magical offensive<br/>
capabilities more than make up for it.  My L31 cleric friend<br/>
is easily able to solo battles using wrath, root, melee, and<br/>
heal that I wouldn&#39;t stand a chance in at L35 (aside from<br/>
using charm).<br/>
<br/>
In terms of raw combat ability (melee + magic), I&#39;d say at<br/>
high levels, bards are the worst of any of the classes.  Our<br/>
strength is in augmenting the combat capabilities of the<br/>
others in our group.<br/>
