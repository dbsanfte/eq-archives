<div id="ygrps-yiv-957759428"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Aren&#39;t you supposed to charm your victim before you kill it to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>clear it&#39;s  exp history list? I thought this would ensure that you <br/>
got the exp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That may work while soloing (I&#39;m not sure as I don&#39;t charm kite), but <br/>
he was trying to show with his example that &quot;allowing charm to break&quot; <br/>
in a group setting would poof the mob you&#39;re fighting.  In that <br/>
situation, it would be pretty difficult to try and recharm the mob <br/>
you&#39;re fighting (to clear it&#39;s damage list) while everyone&#39;s beating <br/>
on it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as mana regen goes, without numbers to back it up, I&#39;d trust <br/>
Kaeria&#39;s findings before I&#39;d trust anyone else&#39;s.  Kaeria&#39;s findings <br/>
show that NO mana regen works on Bards except sitting.<br/>
