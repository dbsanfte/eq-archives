<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110355876">You can charm almost any NPC, however, guards are resistant to charm. I&#39;ve <br/>
never gotten charm to stick on them, and I believe you aren&#39;t supposed to <br/>
be able to.<br/>
<br/>
However, you can charm named NPC&#39;s just like you can most other normal <br/>
NPC&#39;s. Nothing like taking your favorite hated NPC (Dorn, Grimfeather, <br/>
Tarskuk, etc.) and having them beat things up for you. :-)<br/>
