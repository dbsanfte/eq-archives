<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054943813">Actually, the lead art director for the character models, according to Ask <br/>
Milo (a website that throws questions toward one of the EQ artists... anyone <br/>
have an URL?) is female... she designed &#39;em, she approved &#39;em...<br/>
<br/>
Besides... the male models are a little too perfect as well... admittedly <br/>
better clothed, but a little too perfect...<br/>
<br/>
if I remember the reasoning behind the character models, the art team wanted <br/>
the appearance to be &#39;pleasing&#39;... and guess who the primary target audience <br/>
of this game is?  Those teenage boys certainly are pleased...<br/>
<br/>
Women may want to look at several of the upcoming MMORPG&#39;s... one of them in <br/>
particular is TARGETTING women, bringing alot more community building and <br/>
cooperation and less killing to their game (can&#39;t remember the name, <br/>
sorry)...<br/>
<br/>
I know what your thinking, and obviously this type of marketting strategy <br/>
could be construed as sexist... and there are obviously exceptions to every <br/>
rule... but sexist or not, it is quite an effective marketting strategy <br/>
*cough* tomb raider *cough*...<br/>
<br/>
and, to make this bard related... I think the bard class and the cleric <br/>
class appeal most to females because of their cooperative roles and their <br/>
ability to make others around them stronger... agree?  disagree?<br/>

perosnally i think the Dev Team has done a VERY VERY poor job on the female<br/>
models. The clothing they get as newbies COULD be described as sexist and<br/>
male chauvenist crap. Why arent newbie men in lion cloths and singlets?<br/>
Also, for example, Wood Elf Ranger men look WAY better that Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>
It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>
