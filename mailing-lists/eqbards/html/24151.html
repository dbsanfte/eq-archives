<div id="ygrps-yiv-419862272">I guess it makes sense that the more items with manaless effects <br/>
there are in the game (lure items, CH BP&#39;s, etc.) the less use there <br/>
will be for Bard&#39;s mana regen.<br/>
<br/>
Who thought of that when all these items came out, tho?<br/>
<br/>
At least we finally lose our mana battery status. :)<br/>

One thing I&#39;d like to point out... In an uber guild like Afterlife, <br/>
your raid may have the option of adding whatever class/level/baking <br/>
skill you want to a raid, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily work that way <br/>
for non-uber guilds.  Many raids (albeit &quot;lesser&quot; raids) look for <br/>
warm bodies after the main classes are covered (cleric, tanks, <br/>
enchanter).  In the situation Shada describes a Warrior, Monk, Rogue <br/>
or Cleric is better than adding a Bard, but in many cases it will <br/>
come down to adding a Bard over adding no one.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because, adding a warrior, rogue, monk, or cleric is going to be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more useful than a bard helping some wizards med.  also, all our <br/>
wizards will be oom and barely have put a dent in the 500K HP of one <br/>
of these mobs, and will be using their no mana lure items like VP <br/>
staff anyway.<br/>
