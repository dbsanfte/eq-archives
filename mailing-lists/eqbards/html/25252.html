<b>Subject:</b> Question on getting into Dragon raids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596351334">Just starting the epic quest at 52nd and hoping to get into one or two<br/>
more Naggy/Vox dragon raids on Xegony before I hit 53rd. So I wanted try<br/>
this idea out on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
On my second account would it make sense to create two first level rogues?<br/>
One Barb to sneak and park in EF/Perm and one DE to sneak and park in<br/>
Lava/Sol B?<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m playing Tzeetch, I&#39;m thinking I could check for late night raids<br/>
on the second account. (My usual playing time is 10pm ~ 2am PDT.) Sounds<br/>
simple, but since I haven&#39;t heard of anyone discuss I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m<br/>
missing something.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, any fellow Xegony Bards know of any Friday raids going on for these<br/>
two? I have the day off from family and work this Friday :-).<br/>
