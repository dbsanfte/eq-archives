&gt; &gt; Bah, it&#39;s about 81 pounds.  You can run with it just fine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; With Accelerando and a drum, you&#39;ll probably still be faster<br/>

Being 80 pounds overweight slowed me (at level 26) to 73% my<br/>
normal Accelerando speed.  Since my normal Accelerando speed<br/>
was 83% faster than normal running speed, I was still 33%<br/>
faster than normal running speed.  (0.73 * 1.83 =<br/>
1.33).  Given you&#39;re unlikely to kill the cyclops until you&#39;re<br/>
30+, you should be even faster than this.<br/>

&gt; The real challenge is for someone like a necro to catch<br/>
&gt; this little guy while carrying that much.  I know that my<br/>
&gt; necro would be crawling with that much on him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, they made the key component come from a random mob which<br/>
spawns in multiple zones.  So getting the boots is more a<br/>
matter of luck than camping (IMHO a great change, as those of<br/>
us who don&#39;t like to camp finally have an equally or better<br/>
chance of getting a nice item).  So if you happen to see tye<br/>
cyclops, and none of your friends are close enough to get<br/>
there in time to loot it, don&#39;t let the boots go to waste.<br/>
