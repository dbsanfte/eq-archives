Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Kunark at level 19 and have worked my way up to Level 26, mostly<br/>
in the Lake, but also in Warsliks Wood, fighting Forest Giants.<br/>
I am ready now to go to Frontier Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part of Kunark is getting through Firiona Vie without<br/>
being slaughtered by the spiders.<br/>
<br/>
If you can, get someone to invis you. SOme see thorugh invisibile,<br/>
but most don&#39;t.</div>
