<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-953171950">I finaly got KLL to work last night and it is a sweet song in the <br/>
     right situation.  One question. do you sing it once, re-sing it as <br/>
     soon as you see it pulse, or can you weave it with 2 other songs?  It <br/>
     seemed to need to be restarted constantly but I would like to weave it <br/>
     with hym and anthem to help keep me alive.<br/>

Hehe depends! <br/>
     <br/>
If you fight where you gonna get mobbed by greens - you prolly want right <br/>
away.  <br/>
     <br/>
If you fight blues - one at a time - it can wait.<br/>
     <br/>
Like all of our songs - it matures as you gain experience and gets better as <br/>
you level up.  So at first, it will not be really powerfull for you.  It <br/>
should still work and if you have situations where it is gonna be useful <br/>
(crowd control of lesser mobs - later you can control higher mobs but at <br/>
first it will be kinda limited)- yes go get it!  <br/>
     <br/>
For me - its been memmed constantly - more or less since I got it - and now <br/>
at 25 - Aviak Avocets will nod -and yes still resists but hehe - he&#39;s <br/>
nodding a bit! - But we kill him first while the rooks and darters nods in <br/>
peace.<br/>
