<b>Subject:</b> (OT) Performance Update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786723902">This will be my final post on this, in the interest of keeping OT posts to a<br/>
minimum, but I&#39;m under the impression some may find this useful.<br/>
<br/>
I did my tweaking last night, and my disappointment in performance stands.<br/>
I have tested my system, using 3DMark 2000 and 2001, and overall, it tested<br/>
fairly average within it&#39;s class.  To recap, my system is:<br/>
1.0 GHz, AMD<br/>
256 MB PC-133 RAM<br/>
Creative Ahnniliator Pro (GeForce 256 DDR)<br/>
SB Live Xgamer 5.1<br/>
20GB 7200 RPM Drive<br/>
DX8.1<br/>
Win98 SE (fully patched through Windows Update)<br/>
<br/>
My testing was not comprehensive.  I did a comparison 3 different ways.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I did was defragment my hard drive.  After that, I started<br/>
to experiment.<br/>
<br/>
UseTnL=FALSE - I&#39;ve had to leave that in my eqclient.ini file.  When I<br/>
enable hardware T&L, all the colors look faded, and washed out.  Keeping it<br/>
set to false, my colors look the way they should.  I switched back and<br/>
forth, and the washed out colors appeared to be the biggest issue.<br/>
<br/>
Option Settings - I have the new textures loaded.  All tries were at<br/>
1024x768 resolution, and texture compression off.  The third checkbox on<br/>
that screen (lower left), can&#39;t remember what it was...hehe...but it was ON<br/>
for all tests.<br/>
<br/>
First - No models checked, except horse and elementals.  Socials off,<br/>
dynamic lighting on, level of detail high, color depth 32 bit.  Very choppy.<br/>
Unplayable.<br/>
<br/>
Second - No models checked, except horse and elementals.  socials off,<br/>
dynamic lighting off, level of detail medium, color depth 16 bit.  Choppy.<br/>
Probably playable, but not in any raid situation.<br/>
<br/>
Third - 15 models (the number recommended at the screen) enabled, socials<br/>
off, dynamic lighting off, level of detail low, color depth 16 bit.<br/>
Playable, but still not what I expected.  While turning with the keyboard<br/>
was fairly smooth, with occassional video skips, using mouselook to quickly<br/>
turn and look cause pretty bad video skips.<br/>
<br/>
There is hope.  From what I&#39;ve heard guildmates say, the immediate solution<br/>
is RAM.  I will be upgrading immediately to 512 MB of RAM, and then after<br/>
the holidays, will be running with three, 512 MB sticks.  It&#39;s cheap.<br/>
Approx February or March, I will be splurging for the GeForce 3.  At that<br/>
time, I will do a test with EVERYTHING maxxed, and every option on.  Heh..it<br/>
better be perfect.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am also hoping that, as time goes on, Verant tweaks their EQ dx dll.<br/>
There is no reason for me to have to disable my hardware TnL.  I hope they<br/>
fix that soon.<br/>
