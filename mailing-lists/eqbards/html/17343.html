<div id="ygrps-yiv-326062106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Tom has a pretty clear nvidia tilt.  When you read his<br/>
&gt; reviews, he downplays the benchmarks where the 3dfx cards do<br/>
&gt; better, while crowing over the benchmarks where the nvidia<br/>
&gt; cards do better.  Mind you, I happen to agree with him that<br/>
&gt; the nvidia cards are better.  :)  I just wouldn&#39;t call him<br/>
&gt; completely neutral.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True but it&#39;s a lot less biassed than going to &quot;Add&quot; sites. (for want of a<br/>
better term).  He publishes his tests and, while he may downplay some<br/>
aspects he doesn&#39;t hide results the way some places do (Intel and Rambus<br/>
come to mind).<br/>

Generally when I want a full picture I go to Sharkey&#39;s, Tom&#39;s and Sysopt.<br/>
Sharkeys:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com">http://www.sharkyextreme.com</a><br/>
Sysopt:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sysopt.com">http://www.sysopt.com</a><br/>
Toms: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomshardware.com">http://www.tomshardware.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyone know any other good ones?  (While we&#39;re straying so far off topic ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
