<div id="ygrps-yiv-93196727">Interesting to read all the comments.  I have to admit to never seeing<br/>
this before, even when I used charm all night one time in Solusek.  I<br/>
just imagined it was another little unusual thing with Dreadlands/<br/>
Kunark, along with the random faction changes and the way mobs seem to<br/>
ignore the puller and everyone else and focus on one party member for<br/>
no obvious reason.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ll try out a number of commands and be more wary in future.<br/>
Even if we can just take 1 mob out of the fight it&#39;s a help, never<br/>
mind if it isn&#39;t attacking and killing the others alongside us! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all!<br/>

&gt;it happens.  All you have to do is give it a /pet back off and have it<br/>
&gt;attack the correct target.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s because, in that short time between charm breaking and you re-charming<br/>
&gt;it the hate list has been modified by what your party is doing.  When you<br/>
&gt;re-charm it stops attacking you and goes to the next thing on it&#39;s hate<br/>
&gt;list.   Thus it will sometimes (though not always) jump all over one of your<br/>
&gt;party members even though you charmed it.  Just target the correct critter,<br/>
&gt;give /pet back off and /pet kill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;ll take care of it ;)<br/>
