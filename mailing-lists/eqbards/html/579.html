<div id="ygrps-yiv-202280152">Of what I understand from the whole thing. A weapon&#39;s maximum damage is 2<br/>
times the number listed in the stats plus one. I find it very odd that your<br/>
minotaur axe does 18 damage unless you somehow have something that adds one<br/>
more point. According to the game model, strength determines where in the<br/>
range of damage a weapon is capable that you tend to hit. A weak person will<br/>
tend to hit around the 10&#39;s with the axe whereas a strong person would<br/>
frequently connect with 17&#39;s.<br/>

Question about your formula for dps... And maybe it&#39;s a question about<br/>
damage in general...  : )<br/>
<br/>
(damage*2)+1   Where&#39;d you get the *2?  Doesn&#39;t STR get factored in there<br/>
somewhere?  I am extremelly curious about this as I am probably over<br/>
obsessive about Stats.  : )<br/>
<br/>
If someone could break down how my Mino Axe with a damage of 8 does 18 max<br/>
damage for me, I&#39;d appreciate it. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a base strength of 95, going as high as 112 with buffs and equip.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I sorted through the list of weapons on EQLizer for magic 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>
&gt;well-balanced counterparts. Information on these is widely held, so I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;go into detail here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>
&gt;called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the delay<br/>
&gt;is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate: ( (damage<br/>
&gt;* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>
&gt;opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>
&gt;if sold, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>
&gt;only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing magic<br/>
&gt;weapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much hoping<br/>
&gt;I am missing some good ones from this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Barbed Whip<br/>
&gt;Damage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>
&gt;Found on the Bonrcrusher in Najena<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;Casts berserker strnegth occasionally, but I don&#39;t know what this is.<br/>
&gt;Have no idea where it is found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Crystalline Sword<br/>
&gt;Damage 11 / Delay 38 = 6.05 dps<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t even know if this is magical, but I have a feeling it is<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t even know if it is 1H Slashing<br/>
&gt;Please help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cerrated Bone Dirk<br/>
&gt;Damage 9 / Delay Delay 26 = 7.3 dps!<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t know if it is 1H slashing<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t know if it magic<br/>
&gt;I do know it is found on the Froglock Assasin in Guk Bottom<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just for comparison:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mino Axe<br/>
&gt;Damage 8 / Delay 37 = 4.59 dps<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dwarven Axe<br/>
&gt;Damage 6 / Delay 26 = 5 dps<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
