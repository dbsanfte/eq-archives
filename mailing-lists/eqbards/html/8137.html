  I guess this topic, like many previous others on this list, is relative to<br/>
  where you are fighting and what level you are.  I&#39;m 24th level and fighting<br/>
  in the aviak village now.  Of the 24 songs songs available to me, I have the<br/>
  eight songs memorized which I think help me/my party the most.  They are:<br/>
<br/>
  Selos: In case we need to flee<br/>
  Teleport song: In case we need to get to the ground quickly from the top<br/>
  roost.  Trying to run all the way down the ramp is too risky<br/>
  Hymm: to heal the party<br/>
  Chain: slow down attacks and helps pull aviaks off of casters (darters and<br/>
  above don&#39;t flee so you don&#39;t have to worry about that)<br/>
  Lullaby: in case we get more than we can handle<br/>
  Anthem: speed up attacks<br/>
  Lament: in case we only want to fight one aviak at a time.  comes in handy<br/>
  when the top room is full.<br/>
  &gt;ok forgive me why do ye use lament? I took this out of my lineup when i got Lullabye, was that a mistake? Please explain the difference to me thank ye :-)<br/>
  Bellow or warsong: situation dependent.<br/>
