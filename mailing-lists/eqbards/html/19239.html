<b>Subject:</b> Patch effects (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123403268">This was the stated reason for the patch, but I found that either it had<br/>
quite the opposite effect, or by coincidence there were far more connection<br/>
problems last nite than I have ever seen in 14+ months of play.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
been disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>
modem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.  On about<br/>
half those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>
disconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>
<br/>
I was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
showed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>
seen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>
at work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>
sources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>
game was totally unplayable last night.<br/>

&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that were causing<br/>
people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>
months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
before I had to reboot my computer.</div>
