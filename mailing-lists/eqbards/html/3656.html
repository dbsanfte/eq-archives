<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394962126">I was headed toward Kithicor tonite and was running along the dessert wall<br/>
in West Commons and lo and behold I caught up with Gix, taking the path<br/>
along the wall .  Never had seen a mob on a wall like that before, but I<br/>
digress.  Back to what I was saying when I saw him he conned blue to me at<br/>
19th.  He probably has different levels at which he spawns in at.  And<br/>
another thing I found odd was that he only viewed me threatingly, not<br/>
scowls.  Hmph go figure.<br/>

19th Bard - yea I know I level slow, working 50 to 60 hours a week will do<br/>
that to ya.  ;)<br/>

&gt; Are you sure he con&#39;d green? I don&#39;t know the level of your friend, but<br/>
&gt; Kizdean Gix con&#39;d yellow to me at 22 or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe your friend accidentally con&#39;d a kodiak or something.<br/>
