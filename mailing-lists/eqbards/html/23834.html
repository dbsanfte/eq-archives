<div id="ygrps-yiv-280489704">Hymm (heal song), Chant of Battle and chains would have been my mix.  I play<br/>
a cleric as my secondary and I still notice an appreciable ease on my mana<br/>
use at lvl 36 when a bard is mixing in some Hymm.  Also allows necros and<br/>
shamans to chow their health a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
Another spell to think about is Binding.  It has a nice AC Debuff and is<br/>
great for keeping mezzed mobs mad at you rather than the shaman/enchanter.</div>
