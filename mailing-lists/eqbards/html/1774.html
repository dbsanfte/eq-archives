<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523391399">Actually they are VERY useful.  Unlike the invis song, hide and sneak works <br/>
for every type of monsters.  Yes even the ones that see through the invis <br/>
song.  And for hide, once you are hidden, you won&#39;t be visible until you <br/>
unhide or move.  The invis song will ocassionally skip a beat, which could <br/>
be deadly if you are afk and a wander by mob starts to hit on you.  Another <br/>
benefit of hide is that you can actually hide from a creature that you have <br/>
attacked!  I have seen this work for a few rogue friends of mine and it <br/>
saved their lives.  If you walk in a dungeon and see a bunch of mobs moving <br/>
around look like they are chasing someone but no one is in sight.  They are <br/>
probably after a hidden PC.  Rogues used this skill to heal themselves to <br/>
full before escaping the train.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I wish we have are higher skill caps on both of these skills.<br/>

&gt;This is what has me convinced that sneak and hide are two completely <br/>
&gt;useless<br/>
&gt;skills for a bard.  I&#39;ve not once used them as I am constantly singing some<br/>
&gt;sort of song.<br/>

&gt;PS - Hail to Berk and Infiniti, it&#39;s good to see some familiar faces on the<br/>
