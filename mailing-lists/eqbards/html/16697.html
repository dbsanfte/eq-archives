<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250822118">Mark my words, this will get nerfed.<br/>
Clerics currently use the level 19 buffs in place of the level 14 healing <br/>
spell, because it&#39;s just about as efficient, and now it&#39;ll be nearly <br/>
uninterruptable and chain-castable.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think this is worth us griping about.  (maybe because I play my<br/>
&gt;cleric and not my bard now).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does it really hurt us now that bufferes can chain cast their buffs?  It<br/>
&gt;was merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>
&gt;buffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>
&gt;time on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>
&gt;be a shocke eh?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Examples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>
&gt;Center.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>
&gt;recycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>
&gt;Armor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>
&gt;both cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>
&gt;armor (gives 12 ac)...<br/>

&gt;We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
