Efreeti is level 50.  You have to get past a group of 6-8 imp protectors to<br/>
get to him (level 45+ I think).  Boots and ring seem to drop about the same<br/>
amount.<br/>

How hard is the Efreeti to kill, where does he spawn. And how often does he<br/>
drop those Boots?<br/>
I&#39;ve heard those Efreeti boots trade VERY highly - I&#39;ve seen mithril or<br/>
Ykesha&#39;s trade with that one.<br/>
