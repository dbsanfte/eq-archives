<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340271716"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; If you have a snarer in the group, the bard should /not/ be using chains<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless you don&#39;t mind runners. Where I adventure, one runner means evac or<br/>
&gt; &gt; death.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I need to chastise my druid/ranger friends for not<br/>
&gt; doing a good job then.  I am constantly Chaining stuff that<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably so. One of a druid&#39;s (and rangers) primary jobs should be to make<br/>
sure all the mobs are snared, or at least all the mobs taking damage.<br/>
That&#39;s an easy job, seeing as the usual strategy is for everyone to focus<br/>
on one mob.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, I think the amount of taunt is about this same,<br/>
&gt; except Chain gets cast over and over, while Snare you only<br/>
&gt; need to cast once.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, seems the same to me. So the end result is that keeping<br/>
something snared is a minor taunt relative to keeping something chained.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Interesting.  Didn&#39;t know that - that would change strategies<br/>
&gt; considerably.  Can you &quot;refresh&quot; the snare before this period<br/>
&gt; is up by recasting it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I should time exactly how long it lasts at level 40. It&#39;s over 1<br/>
minute, I&#39;d guess 90-150 seconds, probably 120. And you can refresh it at<br/>
any time.<br/>
<br/>
Beware that if someone roots the mob, even after it &#39;breaks free&#39; and is<br/>
running, you will most likely be unable to resnare it (cannot take hold).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; No, it&#39;s MUCH better to rely on casters to snare. Why? Because chains has<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be cast while the runner is trying to run -- one failure and it&#39;s time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ???  You can Chain something that&#39;s already Chained.  If we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; in a dangerous situation and can&#39;t afford runners, I start to<br/>
&gt; Chain a couple rounds before it should begin to run.  If it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a yellow or red mob with a high chance of resisting, I just<br/>
&gt; keep Chaining it over and over after that.  I&#39;ve had just two<br/>
&gt; mobs (red) get away from me in the last month or so of doing<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you can chain again and again. But if you end up with multiple mobs<br/>
running, or a red that&#39;s resisting a lot, you&#39;re in trouble. Whereas it<br/>
may take 3 castings to snare that red guy, but once he&#39;s snared there&#39;s<br/>
nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Like I said, I&#39;m constantly Chaining stuff that starts to run<br/>
&gt; when the snare expires.  At that point, you can still Chain<br/>
&gt; while chasing the mob.  Casters need to stand still to<br/>
&gt; snare/root it again.  So Chain is often the *only* option.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why snare should be expiring. Make sure your casters aren&#39;t<br/>
using ENSNARE (24/29/34 spell?) which is vastly inferior to the level 1<br/>
SNARE. ENSNARE runs out after 1-10 seconds on average. SNARE lasts a<br/>
guaranteed time. THe mob should be dead long before that time expires.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe it changes at higher levels.  Nearly all the recent bad<br/>
&gt; situations I&#39;ve gotten into involving runners was when I<br/>
&gt; relied on a druid or ranger to snare and didn&#39;t bother<br/>
&gt; Chaining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go whip those rangers/druids into shape. =P Snare is one of the best<br/>
spells in the game and they&#39;re not doing their job if they&#39;re not using it<br/>
effectively.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the ONE spell both my druid and ranger ALWAYS had mem&#39;d, no matter<br/>
the circumstances, through a combined 64 levels.</div>
