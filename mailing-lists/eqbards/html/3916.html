Lullaby really shines when you get a seemingly overwhelming<br/>
train that&#39;ll send any enchanter running like a schoolgirl.  <br/>
My friends and I were tackling trains of 6-10 goblins in<br/>
Permafrost this weekend.  I asked the one cleric in the group<br/>
what her mana was after each fight.  50%, 30%, and 40%.  She<br/>
basically tossed 1-3 heals at me during the fight, and maybe<br/>
another heal at one other party member.  I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>
else lost more than 2 bubbles (and then only because of<br/>
multiple spellcasting goblins).  We were regularly taking on<br/>
3-4 goblins and the cleric was getting bored because between<br/>
Lullaby and Hymn (you *can* weave the two, though it depends<br/>
on how resistant the mobs are - experiment), she only had to<br/>
toss in one or two lesser heals during a fight.<br/>
<br/>
The one time we got overwhelmed (I think it was 15 goblins), I<br/>
hit lullaby, gave our overloaded cleric (our loot collector)<br/>
time to gate out, gave everyone else a head start, then I hit<br/>
Screech and ran for the zone.  (Screech by the way does not<br/>
have the 4 mob limit I&#39;d mistakenly thought it did earlier.)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, - them green and blues - were lots of them.  And bunches of them<br/>
&gt; were casters.  So to answer your question - what is worst is a swarm of<br/>
&gt; green casters!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Green casters get higher priority than yellow melee mobs in my<br/>
book.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second - I fired up the song and played my lute but the mistake was running<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how much more effective the song is with a lute.<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed little if any difference, but that may be because<br/>
my charisma is 120.  Perhaps some of the other bards have seen<br/>
a difference?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; down to them to start the attack.  I should have attacked the edges and<br/>
&gt; pulled on one - then if the whole camp jumped me at least they would be<br/>
&gt; close and under the spell.  As it was - I attacked then got them mad and<br/>
&gt; casting without getting close enough to put them all to sleep.  Only a<br/>
&gt; couple came over to fight - the rest just stood off and casted on us and<br/>
&gt; buffed their buddies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spellcasters have this annoying habit of standing in place and<br/>
casting at you after you&#39;ve pulled the melee mobs away.  So<br/>
normally you want to attack where the spellcasters are<br/>
standing.  This is complicated at the raider camp in NK<br/>
because when they flee, they run into the water, and you can&#39;t<br/>
cast at or attack them unless you&#39;re also underwater.  My take<br/>
on the situation would be (depending on number of casters) to<br/>
pull the melee mobs out of the casters&#39; aggro radius, then<br/>
have the enchanter memblur the casters.  When you&#39;ve finished<br/>
the melee mobs, then tackle the casters separately.<br/>
