<b>Subject:</b> Fighting Without  A  Weapon (Becoming a real Bard) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641881319">Hello Fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
   I have been reading this page now for about a month, posted one letter, <br/>
but never saw it, (I think my hotmail account ate it) LOL.  But this board <br/>
has really helped me a lot.  I am a Bard on Bristlebane with 22 songs (3 <br/>
times now).  After reading a lot of stuff on how youll use instraments <br/>
instead of weapons, I wondered if it would realy work.  I was not sure. <br/>
But last night in Oasis I did the DDD, COD, HYMM, LARGO BINDING with out <br/>
using a weapon, and I now for the first time feel like a Bard.<br/>
   I can solo Deepwater Croc&#39;s with about one bubble of life left, and <br/>
Deepwwater Cam&#39;s with about =BD health left.  Last night twisting DDD, <br/>
COD, and HYMM I soloed a Deepwater Croc and Cam at same time and only lost <br/>
56hp&#39;s (can you believe this!!!) two blue con&#39;s only did 56 hp&#39;s to me <br/>
with out picking up a weapon!!! LOL, I was yelling to my guild memebers <br/>
and they were amazed, people sat and watched ME fight.  Like when I watch <br/>
some +40 lev solo a gaint or something.  It was so cool.  Then when I con <br/>
even or yellow to them they all wanted to go out and make bards.<br/>
<br/>
Brangwen Incantare said he uses:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here&#39;s how I put my hotkey bank for them:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;DDD          CoD<br/>
&gt;Hymn         Melee Slot<br/>
&gt;Inventory    Inventory<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I set mine up almost the same:<br/>
<br/>
Melee slot     inventory<br/>
DDD            COD<br/>
HYMM           Largo&#39;s Binding<br/>
<br/>
I did it this way for a few reasons:<br/>
<br/>
A) with the songs above you only need two instraments (Horn and Lute)<br/>
<br/>
B) if you are fighting only one mob you only need the first 3 songs<br/>
If you are fighting two mobs solo, you should twist in Largo&#39;s binding <br/>
for this will slow all the mobs attack speed, and allow your Hymm more <br/>
time to heal you.<br/>
<br/>
C) I put them in this order because I can have my Horn in my melee slot <br/>
already, and my Lute on my pointer (you dont have to drop it to a <br/>
inventory slot till befor the fight when you want to target a mob), play <br/>
DDD with Horn, as soon as the mob wrences drop you Lute in to the melee <br/>
slot (and dont drop the horn, leave it on the pointer over the melee slot) <br/>
play COD, as soon as the mob wrences, play Hymm (you already have the Lute <br/>
in melee slot so you dont have to change).  Now you have your two DoT <br/>
songs (which last four pulses not 3 like most of our songs) going and your <br/>
Hymm healing you.  Start the process over by just droping your Horn in to <br/>
Melee slot and hit key 3. etc., etc., etc...<br/>
<br/>
D) if a second mob attacks you,  Largo&#39;s Binding uses the singing skill <br/>
(no instrament required, your DoT songs are still going (4 pulses not 3) <br/>
so after your Hymm, play LB during which time you can drop you Horn back <br/>
into your melee slot to get ready to play DDD again.<br/>
<br/>
Take it from me, if you have never fought a mob using your instrament <br/>
instead of weapons, you are missing the true feeling of being a bard <br/>
(IMHO).  I dont know if I will ever pick up another weapon.<br/>
