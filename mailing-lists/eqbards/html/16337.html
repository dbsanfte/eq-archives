<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331550893">In my experience, Chains is much less desirable than snare or root for such<br/>
purposes. First, although I have no hard numbers to back me up, I find that<br/>
snare and root are more effective at completely immobilizing mobs (immobs?);<br/>
Chains, I believe, only slows (does not stop) mobs that have &gt;25% health<br/>
remaining until higher levels (50% at 38 or something). Second, snare/root<br/>
is a &quot;fire and forget&quot; sort of thing, whereas Chains, like all songs, has to<br/>
be kept up. All it takes is a missed note and a resist, and the mob could be<br/>
out of sight around a corner in a dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, you can Chain a mob while running after it (running and<br/>
casting don&#39;t mix). And, it&#39;s a great song to twist for an attack speed<br/>
debuff. All in all, though, I wouldn&#39;t stake my life on it to stop a runner<br/>
from pulling his pals down on me.<br/>

&gt; [I] am not certain if Chains will be able to serve as a<br/>
&gt; makeshift snare well enough to be safe. </span></blockquote></div>
