<b>Subject:</b> Another possible suggestion for the GZ letter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-538717252">On the EQlizer website, there is a long letter written by someone that lists<br/>
a lot of recommended changes to EQ as a whole.  A few of the suggestions<br/>
were bard related.  Some of the issues the guy suggested are already covered<br/>
in the letter to GZ that Elwyn has written.  One suggestion wasn&#39;t and bears<br/>
consideration for inclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The writer suggested making the radius of Selos, Invis song, and Underwater<br/>
breathing song zone-wide versus a short radius centered around the bard.<br/>
The reason being that it is potentially very dangerous for the bards&#39; group<br/>
members if they move outside the radius of the song, especially the levitate<br/>
song.  I don&#39;t think asking that Verant to change these songs to affect the<br/>
entire zone has much chance of ever succedding.  However, asking them to<br/>
increase the radius of levitate and underwater breathing is definately<br/>
something that would make life easier on our group members and therefore<br/>
have a higher chance of getting improved.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think this would be a class balance issue because it does absolutely<br/>
nothing to improve the combat/survivability capabilities of the bard.  <br/>
