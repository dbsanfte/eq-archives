<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558284726"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hiya all,<br/>
&gt; I the past I have received excellent advise from this <br/>
&gt; list so I turn to you again...<br/>
&gt; I quit playing my bard at level 30 ( this was about 6 <br/>
&gt; months ago) stripped him of all items and started a Mage <br/>
&gt; the mage is now level 46 and I would now like to stat <br/>
&gt; playing him again, I have a few items for him but mostly <br/>
&gt; need to buy/camp new gear...I&#39;m all set for weapons and<br/>
&gt; instruments. I need armor/jewelry suggestions that a 46th <br/>
&gt; mage could acquire with out much help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are a couple of ways you could approach this depending on how <br/>
soon you want to start playing your bard again. If you want to get <br/>
right back to playing him, I would suggest going to Unrest or Sol B <br/>
and /auctioning that you want to buy bronze armor. Until you get the <br/>
parts for lambent, bronze is not that bad. (Heck, I bet most of us <br/>
were wearing bronze at 30.) The other approach is to spend some time <br/>
at your local /auction zone (GF on Xegony, EC on many others,) and <br/>
start buying lambent.<br/>
<br/>
Quick Tip:<br/>
Take your level 46 magician to the Ocean of Tears (OOT). Get off the <br/>
boat at the Sister Island (First stop coming from Freeport). The next <br/>
Island West (sense heading will say west because the zone is <br/>
backwards) is the island on which the Ancient Cyclops spawns, the <br/>
next island after that is the island on which the seafury cyclops <br/>
spawn. Now, you cannot kill a SF at 46 (well, you *might* be able to, <br/>
but it would be dangerous and take WAY too much mana,) but you CAN <br/>
kill Gornit. He is a hill giant that spawns every 6 minute near the <br/>
pirate camp in the SW corner of the island (once again, it is really <br/>
the NE corner, but the zone was built with the directions backwards.) <br/>
Gornit is also called the ATM because he drops giant loot. You will <br/>
eventually stop carrying anything but the plat, and will leave there <br/>
with quite a bit of money. This is an EASY way to fund your lambent.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for some other suggestions for items:<br/>
*) 2 x Jagged Band... buy them, they are cheap, and are good items.<br/>
*) 2 x Opalline (spelled right?) earrings... cheap, buy them.<br/>
*) Collar of Undead Protection... run to Upper Guk and camp him. <br/>
Heck, if someone else is camping him for the RBF, they will probably <br/>
give you a collar. You can also just buy it for (I would guess) 10-<br/>
20pp.<br/>
*) Run your bard to lower guk and wait for a mask to drop. This is <br/>
time WELL spent. (Most times you can just /ooc that you are looking, <br/>
and you will get one.)<br/>
*) Cazic Thule is not camped like it once was, but the Lizardscale <br/>
Cloak is a good item for a 30 bard.<br/>
*) I assume you have the expansions... the strawspun belt (while <br/>
giving no stats,) gives nice AC and is cheap.<br/>
*) What did I wear on my shoulders??? I think it was crested <br/>
spaulders. Anyway, not too expensive, and nice AC.<br/>
*) If you have the patience, your magician can go to Steamfont and <br/>
camp the Hero. I think half-breeds can wear the Hero Bracer, and it <br/>
is a nice item. You might have to work on your faction, but there are <br/>
some quests to take care of that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok... that it the stuff off the top of my head. If you have more <br/>
questions, please post them. Also, I am sure some of the other bards <br/>
will be able to give you much better advice... but this is one Gael&#39;s <br/>
thoughts. *Smiles*<br/>
