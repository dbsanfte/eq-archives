<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071425763">Well after awhile you have to talk about something I mean how many topics<br/>
can you talk about? Especially 7 months after the game. If something nice<br/>
about the bard happens in game then I guaruntee you that it will be posted<br/>
up immediatly but until it does we need to talk about something.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Too many off-topic posts regarding server/guild politics<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t think posts of this nature are appropriate on this forum. This<br/>
&gt;is a discussion group relating to bard issues, not guild/server<br/>
&gt;politics. Although it&#39;s great to exchange thoughts on dragon raids, I<br/>
&gt;feel discussing politics pertaining to Innoruk/Veeshan, who is a KSer,<br/>
&gt;etc. aren&#39;t what eqbards is about. I only point this out because I<br/>
&gt;logged onto my e-mail this evening and received 191 e-mails since<br/>
&gt;yesterday evening, and the majority seem to be complaints about some<br/>
&gt;guild on Innoruk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please keep discussions relating to the Bard class. If you feel a need<br/>
&gt;to discuss server politics, EQ Vault hosts a very nice series of<br/>
&gt;server-specific boards where issues of this nature may be addressed.<br/>
