<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812424047">Can&#39;t say I disagree entirely with this, but doing this to someone else&#39;s<br/>
character might make the ame less enjoyable for them in the long run.<br/>
Still, a Runed falchion!  <br/>
<br/>
	Kitasi, drooling at just the thought of a runed falchion<br/>
<br/>
Yes it does make life easier in many cases..<br/>
I twinked the hell out of my newbie druid (I should have waited because of <br/>
the short corpse decay rate..dying and having a server go down would mean <br/>
losing all the good stuff if I was unable to get back in time - fortunately <br/>
it didn&#39;t happen). He is now lvl 22 and better equipped than some 50th level<br/>
<br/>
druids I meet. BI medallion, crown of leaves, foreman tunic, gatorskin legs,<br/>
<br/>
runed falch, charred shield, plat armbands, etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
At low level, having an observer staff or runed falchion DRASTICALLY <br/>
improved my survivability with mobs up to a point. This to me enhanced my <br/>
playing experience. =) All the mana items gave me an edge, and I enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a newbie so many times that it gets tiresome worrying about every <br/>
fight. I also don&#39;t kite, so the equipment really helps there as well. =P<br/>
<br/>
The reason I twinked is I have camped all this stuff before and did not look<br/>
<br/>
forward to doing it again. I won&#39;t mind doing it if someone in my group <br/>
needs one; my already having the item and not needing it lessens the <br/>
frustration of watching placeholder after placeholder spawn and die, and <br/>
through all this knowing that I&#39;m usually not going to get my turn to loot <br/>
any time soon. Course this depends on the camp.<br/>
<br/>
As far as looting goes on my primary (bard)- I have a group of friends that <br/>
I hang out with nightly. We are a good mix of people and we determine loot <br/>
order based on who needs what. I almost always place myself at the end of <br/>
the list for items because most items I want are melee-based, and my warrior<br/>
<br/>
friend really could make better use of them than myself. My primary (bard) <br/>
is so decked out (full mithril, dual ykeshas, etc) that the only gear he has<br/>
<br/>
to look forward to is Imbrued Plate which looks urine colored if ya ask me. <br/>
If we loot an item no primaries need, we move on to secondaries, and the <br/>
rest is lottoed to do with as you please. I normally will give loots i <br/>
receive from lottos to friends, my guildmates, or any newbies I happen <br/>
across who could use it. I rarely ever trade or sell anything.<br/>
<br/>
My secondary only loots random mobs if he is soloing. Non-twinked people who<br/>
<br/>
group with me love it because I don&#39;t need nor want any loots.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any problem with twinking unless you are playing your primary, <br/>
and you are trying to short another player&#39;s needy primary on loot just to <br/>
twink your secondary. For example, a friend of mine was camping a Ghoul <br/>
Lord, and the group&#39;s Cleric INSISTED he get the next Ykesha or he would <br/>
ditch. The cleric KNEW my friend (a bard) was in the order to receive a <br/>
Ykesha, but refused to let him have it first or he would leave. Normally <br/>
they would say &quot;then just leave&quot;, but at 6AM high level clerics are not <br/>
always on hand to fill the gap.<br/>
<br/>
As far as not experiencing the thrill of getting that new item for the first<br/>
<br/>
time..I got news for ya, at high levels you will probably have been <br/>
everywhere and camped pretty much everything. Get it over with while you can<br/>
<br/>
- just be fair and don&#39;t place your secondary char&#39;s looting &quot;rights&quot; over <br/>
someone else&#39;s primary. =)<br/>
