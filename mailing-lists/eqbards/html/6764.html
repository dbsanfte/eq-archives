does happen upon a Shimmering Orb (15 AC, 0.2 wt, shield<br/>
slot), it&#39;ll go to the enchanter, wizard, mage, or necro<br/>
before anyone ever thinks about giving it to the bard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, you can&#39;t use a shield with an instrument.  Given a<br/>
tough situation, I think I&#39;d rather have the 100% increase in<br/>
effectiveness an instrument gives most of our songs, than an<br/>
8% increase in AC.<br/>
