of the individual(s) who posted them.  I&#39;ll admit, we have some people in<br/>
the guild who feel the way that post read, but when Cazic died, I sent a<br/>
hearty congrats to Gallenite to pass on.  Killing Cazic is no small feat,<br/>
especially given the difficulty in organizing between guilds.<br/>

Let&#39;s stick with the issues at hand please, this is not a mailing list to<br/>
flame people you don&#39;t like on your server.<br/>
