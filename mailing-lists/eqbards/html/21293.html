<div id="ygrps-yiv-689588700">I think a lot of other EQ players have the same sentiment as you.  They are<br/>
sticking with EQ because of the friendships they have made in the game<br/>
within their guild.  My entire guild (50+ players) is chomping at the bit to<br/>
play NWN.  As soon as NWN is released, all of us will quit EQ.  We have at<br/>
least five people who are going to create their own dungeons/campaign<br/>
settings and set up persistent servers.  I&#39;m not exactly certain how the<br/>
technology end of it will work, but players will be able to link their<br/>
computers together to set up a semi-persistant world. <br/>

However if my guild said &quot;Hey Elf, we&#39;ve decided to move the guild to<br/>
xxxxxxxx (anarchy online, asheron&#39;s call, UO2, Diablo2, Icewind Dale,<br/>
whatever)&quot;  I would leave in a second.  But that being said I don&#39;t see it<br/>
happening, and will continue enjoying my time in Norrath with my friends.<br/>
(despite the occasional quirks...)<br/>
