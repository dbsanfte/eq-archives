<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512215932">Wow, didn&#39;t know Valeyardb was still around.  Been a long time since we ran<br/>
into each other.  There sure seem to be a heck of a lot more bards on E&#39;ci<br/>
than on Sol Ro, the other server I play on semi-regularly.<br/>

I&#39;m in Militia these days, and we have at least 4 high-level bards.  Myself,<br/>
<br/>
Guibu, Vasen, and Valeyardb.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyone know if Aloro is still on this list?  He used to post here quite a <br/>
&gt;bit.  He still posts on The Concert Hall a lot so I know he still plays. <br/>
&gt;Same for John Kim (Kaearia on the Concert Hall).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I know, both of those reprobates are still lurking around here <br/>
somewhere.  I&#39;ll send you a line if I happen to spot one of them.<br/>
