<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610712299"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>
&gt; appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>
&gt; teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>
&gt; per hit. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Giants have and will always hit for ~96 dmg.  Your level makes<br/>
  little difference in the amount of the attack.  Yes, they miss<br/>
  you a lot more often, but a L42 ice giant&#39;s consistant hit is 116,<br/>
  it was 116 when I was L14, and it still is 116 at L50.<br/>
<br/>
  Regardless of level the monster will strike usually in the upper<br/>
  80% of their damage range unless they outright miss you.<br/>
