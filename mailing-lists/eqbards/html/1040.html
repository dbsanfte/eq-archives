Hold itself.  On the first floor near the back there is a<br/>
clerk for the inn.  Go further back and one of the doors leads<br/>
to the prison area.  Take a right after going through that<br/>
door and you&#39;ll come to a vendor at a counter who is the bank.<br/>
Do not explore the prison area unless you are fairly high<br/>
level.  The prisoners are not locked up, and will attack you<br/>
if you get too close.  The guards will not attack them.<br/>
