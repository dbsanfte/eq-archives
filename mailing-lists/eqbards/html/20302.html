<div id="ygrps-yiv-988996974">They&#39;re all stories, even if they&#39;re true. :)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been there since The Hole open, so I can&#39;t confirm or deny <br/>
this rumor, but PRE-The Hole, I have seen 6 drop and have physically <br/>
looted 4 (between my GF who sits right next to me on my LAN and I).<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that &quot;The Kly Overseer&quot; is NOT who you&#39;re looking for.  <br/>
He&#39;s the placeholder and he doesn&#39;t even seem to have a rare drop.  <br/>
You get better loot from the various lesser klys in the room.  &quot;The <br/>
Kly&quot; (that&#39;s his whole name), spawns less than 5% of the time in my <br/>
experience and his ONLY drop AFAIK is the Necklace of Superiority.  <br/>
There may be a rare drop, but I have not heard of it.  And, I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine another item I&#39;d rather get, so I&#39;d be pretty pissed off if <br/>
it wasn&#39;t the necklace on him, heh.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you&#39;ve seen The Kly and have not looted the necklace, then <br/>
chances are it&#39;s been moved.  If you have only seen The Kly Overseer, <br/>
then you haven&#39;t done enuf time. :)  We&#39;ve killed over 160 Overseers <br/>
and have seen 6 The Klys, including a stretch of 16 hours or so <br/>
without any at all and 2 The Klys back to back.  (Of course this is <br/>
mostly 4 - 6 hour camps stretched over several days.)<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you have seen &quot;The Kly&quot; and he did not drop the <br/>
Necklace as I was intending to go back very soon.  The trade offers I <br/>
get for the necklace are just too great to pass up and my neck spot <br/>
is now open.  So far, I&#39;ve gotten 1) GE Boots and Impskin Gloves, 2) <br/>
Froglock Bonecaster&#39;s Robe, 3) Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword, Runed <br/>
Lava Pendant, Slime Coated Harpoon, 4) Cobalt Gaunts and Rothyl&#39;s <br/>
Channeling Crystal.<br/>

Not a huge milestone anymore, but one for me, nonetheless.... DING 50!<br/>

&gt; I was camping The Kly this weekend, and saw NOTHING but a<br/>
&gt; silly helm. Lore no less.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard rumors from it being removed, being made the<br/>
&gt; rare drop, to being moved to The Hole. Can anyone<br/>
&gt; substantiate where this item is anymore? </span></blockquote></div>
