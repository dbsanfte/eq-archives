<div id="ygrps-yiv-697168576">I was wondering why the rogue would think he needed the EBW as well.  Since<br/>
its No drop he can&#39;t sell it.  My rogue used 1 HS weapons for completeness,<br/>

Hi Adam,<br/>
<br/>
While I will no longer be playing EverQuest I would have to say that your<br/>
Rogue is being a bit silly.  There is no need for a Rogue to get an EBW.<br/>
They are far better off using the awesome piercing weapons that rogues get.<br/>
Giving an EBW to a Rogue is silly.  I personally feel they should not be<br/>
able to use the EBW.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone wonders, yes, I play a rogue as well.  We get far superior<br/>
pierce items to the EBW within the game and the EBW is much better suited<br/>
for warriors, rangers and bards.<br/>
<br/>
Sure Rogues get DW and DA.  But I strongly feel that any rogue that uses<br/>
anything except pierce weapons needs to re-consider their class choice.<br/>
<br/>
Thieves do not run around lugging swords.  Nor do assassins.<br/>

I sure hope Verant takes that stupid line out of the EULA soon.  I miss<br/>
playing but I refuse to pay for a game that will snoop around on my hard<br/>
drive and upload information across the internet.<br/>
