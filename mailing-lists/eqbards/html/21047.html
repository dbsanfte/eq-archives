<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470292574">I would suspect that you were outdamaging him - tho the high taunt factor on<br/>
our songs is also a factor.<br/>
<br/>
Once when a ranger in my guild had just lost a level - he ungrouped with me<br/>
(we were the only two in the &quot;low&quot; group on that trip) so he would get exp<br/>
faster.  He was generally a heel. ;)  I was going full instrumental attack<br/>
mode - on the next two mobs I got the kill - not him.  He was 4 levels above<br/>
me and was TOTALLY flabergasted.  I was even a bit surprised.  I was<br/>
swapping lute/horn .. and hadn&#39;t had a weapon to hand in hours.  He even had<br/>
heals from our high end Cleric in the &quot;high&quot; group - while I had to slip in<br/>
a 4th in the weave in a dungeon to get a few shots of hymm for myself.  The<br/>
pull spot was safe for AoE ;) .. I just told him to stop whining and group<br/>
with the Bard :)  However, he was not well set up on weapons - would have<br/>
been harder with a Ranger who made more intelligent weapon choices<br/>
for me to so consistently out damage him IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
- the ex-Menuette of Luclin - now deceased - any with that name now are NOT<br/>
me<br/>
- now a &#39;chanter on Rodcet - their spells work - and a baby Bard there (just<br/>
in case)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] DOTs at 39<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I had an eye opening grouping experience yesterday, I&#39;d just like to share<br/>
&gt; it and get the more experienced bards comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The group:<br/>
&gt; Elfson Allegro Lvl 39 half Bard (and a damn handsome man)<br/>
&gt; 41 Ranger<br/>
&gt; 35 Enchanter<br/>
&gt; 38? Druid<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some reason they wanted to group in the dreadlands (3 of these were<br/>
&gt; guildies and the 4th was a friend).  I said we&#39;re probably over matched<br/>
&gt; there and won&#39;t do very well.  But they wanted to try it, so I agreed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I decide to go full DOT mode since I figured our only shot was to kill<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; suckers fast. (and I wanted to see if my damage calculations were close to<br/>
&gt; correct).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What came as a total shock to me was that the ranger (augmented/buffed,<br/>
&gt; wielding a yak and some weird spear/staff which he says is better off hand<br/>
&gt; weapon than yak) was unable to keep the monsters from agroing on me.  I<br/>
sung<br/>
&gt; 2 chants and Denon&#39;s using Nostrolo Tamborine and a normal horn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was it possible that I was outdamaging him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I was then I am pretty excited about this song combo.  Granted I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use Denon&#39;s in a dungeon (AOE damage bad!), but that could be replaced<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; an number of songs (I often use Melodic Binding in a multi pull dungeon<br/>
&gt; situation, the enchanters are quite grateful when the mobs that break mez<br/>
&gt; come running for me rather than them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any case with those 4 (low level for dreadlands) people we were able to<br/>
&gt; pull pretty much non stop, with the Ranger pulling anything but Ravishing<br/>
&gt; Drolvogs (Those football players hit HARD).  Needless to say the xp was<br/>
&gt; amazing (for an outdoor pull), I got like 1.5 of 39 in about 2 hours...  I<br/>
&gt; havent seen xp like that since I was doing the lvl 18-2? solo DOT attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course at the end (&quot;last pull for me guys!&quot;) the new dragon was trained<br/>
&gt; to Karnor&#39;s and I got killed in his breath weapon (while getting a screen<br/>
&gt; shot!)<br/>
