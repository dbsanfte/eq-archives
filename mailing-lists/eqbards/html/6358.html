<div id="ygrps-yiv-39390109">I am a level 18 bard on the Rathe. Some friends of mine are going to go to <br/>
Runneye in the warlords room tomorrow. The highest is a level 27 Shaman. I <br/>
know I won&#39;t be much use as for damage but I can add buffing and healing to <br/>
the mix easily. But can I group with them and get xp?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
