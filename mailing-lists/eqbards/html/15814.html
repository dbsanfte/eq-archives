Just like having a cleric makes for sloppy melee tactics.  <br/>
Optimal combat efficiency requires a lot of group<br/>
coordination.  Most of us don&#39;t like to fight every fight &quot;on<br/>
the edge&quot; so clerics and enchanters (and to a lesser extent<br/>
nukers) make for slightly less optimal but more fun (less<br/>
stressful) play.<br/>

Taken to an extreme though, you end up becoming clareless and<br/>
sloppy.  A group who always relies on a cleric ends up with<br/>
one person taking all the damage.  Suddenly the cleric dies or<br/>
has to leave the group, and nobody knows who much taunting you<br/>
need to distribute damage.  Likewise, you&#39;re relying on an<br/>
enchanter to do crowd control, so you never learn a feel for<br/>
how much your group is capable of handling sans crowd control.<br/>

discourage this practice.  Nothing is more aggravating than<br/>
running around for 10 minutes looking for something to kill,<br/>
while the enchanter group next to you is queuing them up with<br/>
mez.  You&#39;re using the letter of the &quot;he who attacks first<br/>
owns the mob&quot; rule to violate the spirit of it.<br/>
