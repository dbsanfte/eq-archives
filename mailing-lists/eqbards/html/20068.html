<div id="ygrps-yiv-276605382">But what is wrong with having a secondary class to perform AE crowd control?<br/>
Every other primary game function (tanking, porting, DD, DOTs, etc) has a<br/>
class that does it best followed by classes who can do it but not as good as<br/>
the primary class.  And IMO it wouldn&#39;t devalue the enchanter class.  Groups<br/>
would still prefer enchanters over bards for crowd control because they do<br/>
it better.  But if an enchanter is not available, then a group with a bard<br/>
can still go, albeit with higher risk, to the high level dungeons where<br/>
enchanters are considered mandatory.  The &quot;risk vs reward&quot; theme is part of<br/>
the official Vision (tm).  So groups willing to risk going to these places<br/>
with a bard to handle AE crowd control deserve the chance to get rewarded if<br/>
they are willing to risk it.  <br/>

I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>
is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>
would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>
will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>
<br/>
An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>
to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>
than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>
song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>
make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>
mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>
