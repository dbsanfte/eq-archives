<div id="ygrps-yiv-351574631">Unfortunatly, the lute is in a place that is hardly even camped by people. You won&#39;t be able to bug them<br/>
to loot it if they aren&#39;t there. The carapace isn&#39;t as hard, but gargoyles aren&#39;t camped frequently<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to buy the thing from a twink that is being parted out, or from a Bard that has upgraded.<br/>
