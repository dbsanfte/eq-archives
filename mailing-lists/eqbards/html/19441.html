<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094186736">In specific terms I was referring to the &quot;Test of&quot; events.  If they are<br/>
geared towards rewarding the best bard on the server, then IMO level should<br/>
not be a factor.  Gonna use your analogy against you but I prefer baseball<br/>
instead.  I played baseball in high school.  I wasn&#39;t good enough to play in<br/>
college or professionally.  Those who did have the talent to be MLB players<br/>
reaped the reward of lucrative contracts.  There is nothing wrong with that<br/>
and in no way should I expect to receive any special consideration because I<br/>
wasn&#39;t as good as them.  Compare that now to EQ.  Achieving 50th level is<br/>
primarily a function of time available to devote to the game.  You could<br/>
have absolutely no clue how to play a bard well and still make 50th level.<br/>
You may end up dying more than other bards but can eventually make 50th<br/>
through perserverance alone.  I&#39;ve been playing my bard (my primary<br/>
character) since 11 April 99 but only have 35 days played.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
have as much time to play as others.  Thats a fact of life as well and<br/>
something else I can deal with.  The players who can devote the time<br/>
necessary to attain 50th level are rewarded by getting to go to places that<br/>
I can&#39;t (high level dungeons, dragon/plave raids etc.)  But there are a lot<br/>
of 50+ bards who do not know as much about the bard class as I do.  So who<br/>
is the better bard?  A lower level bard who knows how every song works (even<br/>
though he can&#39;t use some of them yet) and when to sing them or a 50th level<br/>
bard who may not have a clue what songs should be sung in a certain<br/>
situation?<br/>
<br/>
Let me end this with saying that I&#39;m not trying to say I&#39;m the best bard on<br/>
E&#39;ci.  There are a lot of good bards on the server (Kitasi, Reed, Faras and<br/>
Aloro from this list come to mind) who are just as good or better than me.<br/>
But if Verant is going to hold a special event and reward only one bard on<br/>
the server then I would like a fair chance to compete in it.  The only way<br/>
to do this is to rule out character level as the main criteria in judging.<br/>
To not do so is a slap in the face to every casual gamer who plays EQ.  <br/>

&gt;the level 50+ folks.  Kitasi and I were both agreeing that GM events should<br/>
&gt;be geared towards a specific level range.  For example, if there is a GM<br/>
&gt;event in GFay, which is a low level zone, then the only people eligible to<br/>
&gt;participate and receive any potential reward are those people in the level<br/>
&gt;range the zone was designed for.  But Verant doesn&#39;t do this.  If they hold<br/>
&gt;an event in GFay the entire zone will be full of level 50s trying to kill<br/>
&gt;the GM controlled mobs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are you speaking of all gm driven events or just the test of events?<br/>
<br/>
the test of events seem geared towards higher level players, no doubt about<br/>
that.  is there anything inherently wrong with that?  not really.  i may<br/>
like basketball,<br/>
but i don&#39;t expect to be able to play in the NBA.<br/>
