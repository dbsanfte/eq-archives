<div id="ygrps-yiv-992143883">And in actual fact this just adds more time to the equation. Instead of<br/>
going to the plane, killing mobs and lottoing for the occasional nice<br/>
item, you now have to get 2 or 3 objects, probably via lotto of all the<br/>
people who could use it, then turn those in for one nice item. And hope<br/>
they&#39;ve debugged the quests, which I hear are incredibly buggy. <br/>

&gt; Heh you realize the quests in planes are no diffrent? It&#39;s more tedious<br/>
&gt; actually. The same mobs you hunt drop the quest components you turn them in<br/>
&gt; and get a item. Besides which more then half of them are broken.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Its really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of sky when quests are my favorite part of the game.  Lame as many of<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are they are still more fun than camping.<br/>
