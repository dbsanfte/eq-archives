&gt; &gt; Funny you should mention that.  I think the same bug is<br/>
&gt; &gt; affecting Lullaby.  Lullaby does not have a knockback<br/>
&gt; &gt; component so the &quot;stun&quot; effect is the only way it can<br/>
&gt; &gt; interrupt spells.  I&#39;ve seen a handful of cases the last week<br/>
&gt; &gt; where spellcasting mobs nodded, but successfully completed<br/>
&gt; &gt; their spells. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been like that for ages. Months ago I noticed this when using<br/>
&gt; Lullaby on lizards in Cazic. Justicators got heals off, wraths off,<br/>
&gt; ever kind of spell, dispite supposedly being asleep.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll remember I complained about this several months ago.  <br/>
I think it&#39;s just something about the lizards in Cazic that<br/>
lets them cast in their sleep.  I did not have problems with<br/>
this happening in Permafrost, Solusek, or Guk until recently<br/>
when they broke Pixie Strike.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Cazic was a test case to see if we&#39;d notice.  *shudder*<br/>
