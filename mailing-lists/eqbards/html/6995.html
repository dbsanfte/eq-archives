<b>Subject:</b> Re: Petiton to replace level 14 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098140037">Yes I KNOW we have damaging songs, I use them all the time. My  suggestion<br/>
was for a song which would be of equivalent damage to the lvl 14 spells of a<br/>
druid. My apologies for not clarifying.<br/>
I did think it a realistic option that verrant might consider. Here is one<br/>
other idea..and one dear to my heart! GET US WOMEN WEDDING DRESSES..with<br/>
mine coming up so near I know it will be too late for me :( but a wedding<br/>
dress instead of plate would be SO nice..sigh.....<br/>
