<div id="ygrps-yiv-38929997"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So you&#39;re basically having the bard waste an extra song slot<br/>
&gt; (still need Chain in case something goes wrong with snare)<br/>
&gt; because the ranger/druid is too lazy to wait for you to give<br/>
&gt; the &quot;Chain off&quot; message?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 100% deferral to snare is not the optimal solution.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, in your fantastic analysis of my song line up, I suppose that is<br/>
exactly what I am doing, wasting a spot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But don&#39;t you see, that very same argument works against snare<br/>
&gt; just as well as chain.  If all it takes to deal with a runner<br/>
&gt; is a nuke and a DoT, then it doesn&#39;t matter if you overwrite<br/>
&gt; snare with chain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are out of context here.  The nuke-DOT comment has nothing to do with<br/>
the snare/chain.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the one hand, you claim you almost never use chain,<br/>
&gt; deferring to druid/ranger snarers and shaman/enchanter speed<br/>
&gt; debuffers.  On the other hand, you speak as if with expertise<br/>
&gt; about how reliable chain is against high level mobs.  Do you<br/>
&gt; see the credibility problem here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Credibility MY ASS!  You really think I always have a druid or ranger in the<br/>
party?  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been relegated to the role of<br/>
stopping runners.  The only person who has any credibility in this<br/>
discussion is the one who has had to use chains as the parties ONLY means of<br/>
stopping runners AND has seen the other side with a druid or ranger doing<br/>
their job.  If there is a credibility question perhaps it is you since you<br/>
always party with a druid... Try without one sometime.  It gives you a whole<br/>
new perspective on chains.  Sorry, I take huge offense when someone<br/>
questions my credibility.   Are you trying to say that I make this stuff up?<br/>
Hmmm, perhaps because I&#39;m 5 levels lower then you are I&#39;m just stupid.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I&#39;ve had it wear off immediately from a L2 beetle.  It<br/>
&gt; happens from time to time.  95% of the time in my experience,<br/>
&gt; it works fine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see a log analysis here.  In my experience its more liek 40% to<br/>
50%...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Try the live side.  Most people avoid the maze and noble/king<br/>
&gt; area for some reason (probably so set into the camp mentality<br/>
&gt; that having to run around confusing corridors is terrifying<br/>
&gt; for them).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Live side on Prexus is just as camped as the dead side...  Got about as much<br/>
chance getting to see the evil eye or crusader as you do getting in a lord<br/>
group.</div>
