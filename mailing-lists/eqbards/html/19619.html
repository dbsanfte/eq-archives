*Gasp* random<br/>

You should see Nethack and the comments about the RNG (it is the main<br/>
god of Nethack, the Random Nethack Generator. If you&#39;re having a string<br/>
of poor games, it is suggested that you sacrifice a few ames to the RNG<br/>
to improve your luck. Etc) and how it seems to give and give and give some<br/>
games, and then nothing the next.</div>
