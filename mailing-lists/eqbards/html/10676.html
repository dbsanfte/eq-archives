<br/>
  Your chains wont matter, your charm doesnt work anymore, pixie<br/>
  strike doesnt hold monsters well enough, you are like a mosquito<br/>
  pricking the enemy with your tiny axe and dirk, and people will  <br/>
  say &quot;why am I going beserk - what is a burst of strength/speed?&quot;<br/>
  Lullaby?  Damn, I forgot I even had that... what level was it again?<br/>
  <br/>
  You will be reduced to nothing but a L32 bard with your manasong =)<br/>
<br/>
  Can you play manasong?<br/>
  Hey can you twist in manasong during battle?<br/>
  Are you playing manasong?<br/>
  Don&#39;t bother with anything else but manasong.<br/>
  Hey, my mind isn&#39;t clearing.<br/>
<br/>
  Your future gets much better &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
