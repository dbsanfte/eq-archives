<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lambent Stones on E&#39;ci <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130305822">In my lambent quests on Prexus, I&#39;ve bought most of my stones for 10 to 20pp<br/>
a piece (minus 1 I got personally off a SG in South Ro).  On a few<br/>
occasions, I was about to close the sale when high level twinking their<br/>
sub-level 10 bard would sweep in and give an outrageous offer for 100pp<br/>
plus.  I&#39;ve always been of the opinion that if they want to pay that much,<br/>
then more power to them, but I&#39;m not paying that much.  I&#39;m just hoping<br/>
those idiots will be around when all the bards I know have lambent and I&#39;m<br/>
farming SG&#39;s...  Of course if it is a bard asking for the stone off the SG I<br/>
just killed, when then I say give to him/her for free :-).<br/>

&gt; I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m running around NRo/Oasis/SRo regularly now and shouting out<br/>
&gt; for lambent<br/>
&gt; stones assuming people will be cool and just give them to the<br/>
&gt; poor bard who<br/>
&gt; needs them for his armor quest like most people do with all the<br/>
&gt; rest of the<br/>
&gt; no-drop quest components for all the other classes.  I assumed wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying<br/>
&gt; to cash in<br/>
&gt; on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
&gt; cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
&gt; saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
&gt; refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent<br/>
&gt; over 1000pp<br/>
&gt; purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not<br/>
&gt; going to hand<br/>
&gt; some greedy bugger more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but<br/>
&gt; I killed 4<br/>
&gt; last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>
&gt; the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>
&gt; that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my<br/>
&gt; armor and I am<br/>
&gt; certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>
&gt; have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and<br/>
&gt; have killed 5<br/>
&gt; giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>
&gt; the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>
