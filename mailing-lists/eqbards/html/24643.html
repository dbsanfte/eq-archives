<div id="ygrps-yiv-511473375">When Velious first came out - I got a lot of Guardian and some Sentry Armor.<br/>
A good amount of the mobs were blue to me (I was 50 or 51 I think) - I think<br/>
you can get SOME xp fighting Guardians and Sentries up to 52.  You&#39;ll also<br/>
get some spell drops - and it&#39;s a great way to work on Kromref (sp?)<br/>
faction - to be able to bank and buy food in Kael.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the minimum level to fight there would be - 41 may be a<br/>
tad low - I would expect by mid 40&#39;s you&#39;d get great loot and items.  But<br/>
you won&#39;t be able to take along anyone who wants Dragon faction<br/>

<br/>
Been grouping in Skyshrine with some higher level friends -- the dropped<br/>
armor there totally rocks -- and a full set of it will take your resists<br/>
right off the charts.<br/>
<br/>
I know a 52 druid there soloing to twink his 23 warrior.  Are any bards<br/>
doing this?  If so, what level and what songs are you using?<br/>
<br/>
Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
Bard of 41 songs<br/>
