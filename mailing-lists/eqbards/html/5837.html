&gt; When the group has SoW available, I usually go with it.<br/>
&gt; Retreats are rarely organized and people tend to break off at<br/>
&gt; different times.  If everyone is SoW&#39;ed, I don&#39;t have to wait<br/>
&gt; around for everyone else to leave first, so I am at less risk.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m finding this to be more important now that I can&#39;t tank as<br/>
&gt; well as the other true tanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with you there John.  Hands down Selo&#39;s is faster and<br/>
generally better in controlled situations.  However whenever you have a<br/>
scattered retreat, SOW is absolutely great for your group.  I had to learn<br/>
this the hard way when my guild got wiped out by a roving cyclop a few<br/>
levels ago.  I was the first to die BTW.  Another that I do to help my<br/>
group when I was in unrest was to generally fire off Lullaby while the<br/>
group retreated.  That help all of the mobs go aggro on me, after everyone<br/>
is running away I will fire up Selo&#39;s and run the mobs around for a bit.<br/>
The only mobs that you have to worry about are the hags and the dry bones<br/>
since they are casters.<br/>
