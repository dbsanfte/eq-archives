<div id="ygrps-yiv-190784351">I never got to play when the song worked (started Elfson at the end of<br/>
December) so this hasn&#39;t bothered me as much as some of the older bards.  I<br/>
have liked playing Elfson for 42 (woohoo!) levels without any ability to AOE<br/>
mez, and I will continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish there was some way to &quot;doa dungeon&quot; without an enchanter in your<br/>
group.  (Fortunatly my guild of like 20 35+ chars has 3 enchanters, so ita<br/>
not often a problem).  Veerant claims they wish people would &quot;do dungeons&quot;,<br/>
which (according to them) means walk around, kill stuff, med up and continue<br/>
moving.  This is a very fun way to play.  You just need 3 things to do it<br/>
without dying frequently.<br/>
<br/>
1. A meat shield.  This role is best filled by a warrior (as it should be),<br/>
but a paladin, shadowknight can fill in with little problem.  Rangers and<br/>
monks (maybe rogues,I have little experience with them) also with a little<br/>
more healing.  Maybe in a real pinch a buffed up bard could do it, but you<br/>
better have pets and blasters to help him out then.<br/>
<br/>
2. A healer.  Clerics are the clear choice here, but shamans, druids and<br/>
even paladins can fill in and the group still works.<br/>
<br/>
3. Crowd control.  Post 30, there is no one who fills this role but an<br/>
enchanter.  We (bards) are the second best (I think, I dont know how well<br/>
necros can do this).  And I know I can&#39;t do it well enough to &quot;do a<br/>
dungeon&quot;.  In the mid 40&#39;s, we are able to break most rooms (with a lot of<br/>
good playing) without an enchanter, and then holding the room becomes no<br/>
problem.  But the mana cost of the break in makes it impossible to keep<br/>
moving through the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
There in lies the problem, you can&#39;t play the game (as Verant intended)<br/>
without an enchanter.  This is why people sit in one place (frequently<br/>
outdoors where you can easily pull singles) and camp.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean this is a slight to the other classes in the game (ie the<br/>
damage boys).  They are great in a group and I love wizards (expecially when<br/>
we are going after a big named spawn).  I just don&#39;t see tem as &quot;necessary&quot;<br/>
for crawling through a dungeon.  They just make it easier.<br/>
<br/>
Once again VI shows a lack of (how ironically) vision.  I quit EQ in Feb for<br/>
almost 2 months, but I missed my friends, so I came back (and worked my blue<br/>
heiny off to catch up with them level wise).  I love bards, I play them in<br/>
any new game I get.  However if my guild said &quot;Hey Elf, we&#39;ve decided to<br/>
move the guild to xxxxxxxx (anarchy online, asheron&#39;s call, UO2, Diablo2,<br/>
Icewind Dale, whatever)&quot;  I would leave in a second.  But that being said I<br/>
don&#39;t see it happening, and will continue enjoying my time in Norrath with<br/>
my friends.  (despite the occasional quirks...)</div>
