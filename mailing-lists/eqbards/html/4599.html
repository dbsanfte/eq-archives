<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137745099">Hiya fellow bards,<br/>
<br/>
The thing I hate the most is  rumors so I am asking fer your help to end<br/>
these rumors? With the newest patch we are supposedly able to combine<br/>
tradeskills i.e. blacksmithg and pottery? There are new sketches out from<br/>
what people say but boys and girls I went all over norrath shopping last<br/>
night and was unable to find a single one. Has anyone successfully done<br/>
this yet and if so please some help ? Ohh and if this is true I wonder if<br/>
we can make new instruments with some kinda bonus? A mandolin with metal<br/>
strings:) flutes with valves, a baby grand in our pocket:)<br/>
<br/>
Looking fer your help,<br/>
