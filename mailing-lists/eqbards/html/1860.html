<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536709667">Reading the part below about dual wield, does it then follow that<br/>
you should go with the biggest damage weapon you can possibly<br/>
find, regardless of delay, to use in your second hand? ie: will<br/>
the second weapon go off on a successful dual wield check even<br/>
if it just went off on the previous swing which was done very<br/>
recently with your super fast dragoon dirk (or whatever)?<br/>

&gt; Since dual wield checks to see if it goes off every swing cycle, <br/>
&gt; more speed<br/>
&gt; means more chances to dual wield, netting a HUGE increase in damage over<br/>
&gt; time by using a faster weapon.  HUGE.<br/>
