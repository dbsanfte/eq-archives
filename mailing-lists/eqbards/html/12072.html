<div id="ygrps-yiv-238518582">Aye, sorry.  I&#39;ve heard the same thing, that Clarity didn&#39;t seem to &quot;stack&quot;<br/>
with Call of Bones + Hymn.  I generally have other casters in the group for<br/>
whom I&#39;m singing Clarity, therefore I was playing Hymn for her and Clarity<br/>
for the others.  I was just saying that it would be easier on the bard to<br/>
just be singing Clarity.  Bards need bathroom breaks too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got a necro friend that turns into a pile of bones between<br/>
&gt; fights with<br/>
&gt; &gt; Call of Bones.  It&#39;s actually kind of annoying as I now have to<br/>
&gt; sit at my<br/>
&gt; &gt; keyboard and weave Hymn and Clarity just for her.  Whereas she<br/>
&gt; can go afk or<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch TV or whatever.  But.  I don&#39;t complain to her.  Much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm, my necro friend said Clarity overwrote (canceled or<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t stack, I dunno) the mana regen benefit of being in<br/>
&gt; skeletal form.  He said to just keep Hymn playing.  Since he<br/>
&gt; was the only necro I regularly grouped with, I took his word<br/>
&gt; for it and didn&#39;t press the matter.<br/>
