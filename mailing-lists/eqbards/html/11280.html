<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s Hard to be a Bard<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s hard to be a bard, although I have to say,<br/>
I love it though it hurts to know it&#39;s changing every day<br/>
In ways I think the gods must blink in puzzlement to see -<br/>
The many ways these changing days have been the death of me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a song, though not for long, a joy for me to play<br/>
It let me fly across the sky, but then, the other day<br/>
My levitate began to wait before it would relight<br/>
And so I fell and died, oh well... a casualty of Flight.<br/>
<br/>
I have a greed for superspeed, I simply hate to wait<br/>
To break a root, there&#39;s no dispute, Accelerando&#39;s great<br/>
And then one day, to my dismay, ghoul-rooted and in need,<br/>
My precious tune did nothing boon... a casualty of Speed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve one refrain, a sonic chain - it slows the target down<br/>
Reducing flight, and in a fight, it&#39;s justly won renown.<br/>
A fleeing whelp returned with help; one change my fate explains -<br/>
Since he had SoW, I could not slow... a casualty of Chains.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very sad to say I had the horrid luck to see<br/>
Upon the plain, through fog and rain, The Thing That Must Not Be.<br/>
To show their ire, the gods rained fire, and both of us were charred...<br/>
Apparently the gods could see the Thing but not the bard.<br/>

I&#39;m sure there are some other stanzas I should include, but can&#39;t think of <br/>
what other unintended/undocumented nerfs have hit us lately.  Any <br/>
suggestions?</div>
