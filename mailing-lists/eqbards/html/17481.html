<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056032276">Ok, here&#39;s the numbers at 23rd level.<br/>
<br/>
Weapon Combo: 	PGT and Dragoon Dirk	6/26 and 6/23<br/>
<br/>
			Songs Sung:		Warsong, Chant of Battle,<br/>
Hymn<br/>
			Damage/Second:	4.56		vs. Gargoyle Blue<br/>
Cons<br/>
			Heal/Second:	1.0<br/>
			Total:		5.56<br/>
			Added Benefit:	Plus AC, Damage Screen	2.3 times<br/>
per fight<br/>
<br/>
Instrument Combo:	Brass and Strings		Both store bought,<br/>
normal<br/>
<br/>
			Songs Sung:		Chords, Denon&#39;s, Hymn<br/>
			Damage/Second:	4.15		(using formula with<br/>
resist% for each)<br/>
			Heal/Second:	1.5<br/>
			Total:		5.65<br/>
			Added Benefit:	Total Damage vs 2 mobs = 9.80/sec<br/>
<br/>
			General Formula:	3.33(R1) + 2.33(R2)<br/>
<br/>
						R1 = % Denon&#39;s not resisted<br/>
						R2 = % Chords not resisted<br/>
<br/>
						Denon&#39;s was resisted 40%,<br/>
Chords 10%<br/>
						Gargoyles have high MR?<br/>
<br/>
		Analysis:	I found that Largo&#39;s outperformed Hymn while<br/>
singing.  Looks <br/>
				like at 23rd level the two are pretty<br/>
balanced, at least<br/>
				against gargoyles.  I definitely had fewer<br/>
missed notes and<br/>
				less twiddling while meleeing.  The fights<br/>
with 3+ Damage<br/>
				Screen Procs went really well, the fights in<br/>
all instrument<br/>
				did not vary as much as the melee ones.<br/>
Overall melee still <br/>
				won out slightly over instruments but its<br/>
close to changing<br/>
				and that is apparent.<br/>
<br/>
				24 will see a damage output increase for the<br/>
all instrument<br/>
				attack due to lvl/6 and lvl/3 equations.<br/>
Maybe 24 is the<br/>
				turning point for a bard?  Also note weapon<br/>
procs will<br/>
				drastically change these numbers.<br/>
<br/>
				With all instruments I still couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
2 gargs at once<br/>
				so multiple mob damage would be moot while<br/>
soloing.<br/>
