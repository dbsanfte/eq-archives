<div id="ygrps-yiv-671676652">From what I have heard from druid and mage friends is &quot;no&quot; (at least for<br/>
their spells, but I don&#39;t think there would be much difference between the<br/>
spell and the song).  Once you rae targeted by a crit, you stay targeted<br/>
until you zone or get out of it&#39;s aggro area.  (Found out about the aggro<br/>
area in EK the other night when I would outrun a griffawn or an extra gnoll<br/>
reaver while trying to drag it to a druid friend of mine nwho was kiting<br/>
crags near he barb fishing village.)<br/>
    If you escapeit&#39;s aggro area, it will seem to forget about you until you<br/>
get back in the area. (Or maybe they just knew I would be bacK?  Damned IA<br/>
=oPP  )<br/>
