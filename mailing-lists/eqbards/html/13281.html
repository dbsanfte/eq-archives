		THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME IN MY DAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
		Ya, Tani is still 17... I really want to get Halana to 50<br/>
(or at least 47) .. then we will have mucho bard time.  Also started a<br/>
cleric on Prexus to play with RL friends (/pout Bard already taken in the<br/>
group).  I think the choice is clear... I&#39;m going to have to quit my job :-)<br/>
Or, I could blame it on Minkin going to the dark side and playing a SK,<br/>
leaving me without a role model :P<br/>
<br/>
		And yes, I keep a leash on my pet :-)  I actually won&#39;t use<br/>
one in a dungeon unless I know it really well or we&#39;re just camping.  The<br/>
problem with Shamen is that we don&#39;t get pets until 34 so we tend to forget<br/>
that we have to watch out for em.  But if I don&#39;t see my pet, I am /pet get<br/>
lost or invis in about 2.5 secs... because yes, I once got hit through a<br/>
wall in guk, my pet ran out to find the mob and almost killed the party.<br/>
Same reason I don&#39;t use AE but that&#39;s a different story....<br/>

				  What about your bard? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
				  And are you one of those shaman who don&#39;t<br/>
keep a leash on their pups?<br/>
				  /grrr  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
				  We got majorly trained again the other<br/>
night when a frenzied spirit<br/>
				  did just that; it frenzied and pulled like<br/>
3 spite golems and 2 <br/>
				  clerics.  I would have disciplined the pup<br/>
had it not died.<br/>
<br/>
				  Multiple mob scenario, 5 bards, guess who<br/>
were the first bodies on <br/>
				  the floor?  I hope they implement meditate<br/>
soon, I die way too often<br/>
				  these days.  Someone here said you can<br/>
hold the meditate button or<br/>
				  press it a bunch to speed up memming, that<br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  I tried it.<br/>
