<div id="ygrps-yiv-317761581">You press ACCEPT on the software license every time you log in.<br/>
This is a binding legal document that no judge will overturn in favor of a<br/>
software hack or emulator.<br/>
You paid 50$ for the company to ALLOW you to USE the software.<br/>
It is STILL theirs.<br/>
Not a flame, just informing you why you are not allowed to do such a thing.<br/>
