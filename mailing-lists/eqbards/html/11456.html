<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092356299">It would be *very* difficult to zone from Sol B into Sol A using this<br/>
particular zoneline.  Getting to it in Sol B would be difficult and<br/>
dangerous (perhaps impossible), and once you zoned into Sol A you&#39;re facing<br/>
a tall lavafall and no way out if you can&#39;t overcome it.  Even if you *do*<br/>
overcome it, you still in the lava pit that has no exit in Sol A.  This is a<br/>
really sadistic trap in Sol A - if you fall in there&#39;s no way out for a<br/>
non-caster other than zoning into Sol B.<br/>
<br/>
This whole thread happened to me and it&#39;s one of my favorite &quot;OMG I LIVED!&quot;<br/>
stories:<br/>
<br/>
I was in Sol A at level 24 and, though invis, was seen by a wizzie.  Well I<br/>
spun, and at 1024x768 experienced a big video stutter which put me facing a<br/>
few degrees differently than I had expected.  I ran right off into the lava.<br/>
Well I tried not to panic.  I swam back and forth looking for some steps or<br/>
a ledge that I assumed would be around there.  I died.  So I come back to<br/>
Sol A, get a lev from a friend and jump down to the lava.  I use my song to<br/>
try and locate my corpse but it&#39;s pointing me all over and /corpse says that<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;too far away&quot; no matter where I go even though I had a very good idea<br/>
of where I&#39;d died.  So I petition and begind trying to get out.  On the Sol<br/>
B zone side of that lava there is no way out other than gate or teleporting,<br/>
but if you swim along you&#39;ll find a lavafall that is very tall (20&#39; perhaps)<br/>
that you can go down.  It&#39;s obvious that you won&#39;t be able to get back up<br/>
that lavafall, but when my lev wore off it was my last resort.  Burning all<br/>
the way I swam down the long waterfall, forward a few feet, and hit a zone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Welcome to Nagafen&#39;s Lair&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m still in lava and burning.  I swam forward to an opening and a<br/>
*very* long lavafall into a cavern in Sol B.  I got right to the lip so that<br/>
I could look down and see if I could make a jump to something and the<br/>
burning STOPPED.  If you sit *right* on the lip of the lavafall into Sol B<br/>
you won&#39;t get burned even though you&#39;re on lava!  So I fired up Hymn, sat<br/>
down in the lava and counted my blessings.  My blessings were mixed though<br/>
because this was months ago and even on crowded old Fennin Ro Sol B wasn&#39;t<br/>
very heavily camped.  From on that ledge you have a great view of what I now<br/>
know are the Champion, Priest and King Rooms in Sol B.  At the time all I<br/>
saw were red Kobolds of various kinds and NO players even though as I recall<br/>
there were 14 or so in the zone.  I /shout for some tips to the zone and no<br/>
one even takes notice of me, grrr.  Well I decide &quot;what the hell, I&#39;m<br/>
nekkid, I&#39;m only facing an experience loss here.&quot; so I heal up and jump to a<br/>
stone outcropping.  From there I can make a jump to a ledge with three<br/>
kobolds on it (Champion Room).  I brace myself for my quick death, run, jump<br/>
and sprint right through the midst of the Kobolds and out into a hall<br/>
practically brushing up against them.  I ran into the hall, turned left and<br/>
go a few paces further before I realized nothing was hitting me.  They<br/>
*didn&#39;t* attack me at level 24 with bard hate?  What?  To this day I still<br/>
don&#39;t understand it.  A naked level 24 bard shouldn&#39;t have made it all the<br/>
way to the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
So I stand in the hall near the stone trap that moves up and down in Sol B<br/>
and /shout once more.  Using that landmark someone knows where I am and<br/>
comes and leads me to the lavastorm zone.  I still can&#39;t believe I survived<br/>
that one.  Well as I zoned back into Sol A I found a GM (Tunso on Fennin Ro)<br/>
there.  He had received my /petition and had moved my corpse to the zone for<br/>
me because it had been stuck outside of the world.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava<br/>
&gt; pool into Sol-b?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would<br/>
&gt; end up in Lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone<br/>
&gt; out of sol-b<br/>
&gt; &gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes.  Absolutely.  I&#39;ve seen it happen to two people.<br/>
