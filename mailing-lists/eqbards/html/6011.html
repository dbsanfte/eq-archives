&gt; <br/>
&gt; With regards to the Staff of Writhing... I have one and they <br/>
&gt; dont work til<br/>
&gt; lvl 28+. I was &quot;given&quot; one at lvl 26 and it didnt work so I <br/>
&gt; returned it :) I<br/>
&gt; have had my current one since 32 with no problems at all. <br/>
&gt; Also the nice new<br/>
&gt; toy I have, the Orb of Tishan has Not  gone off for me yet ( <br/>
&gt; BOO HOO)  but<br/>
&gt; it does bash for up to 32 points of damage...as soon as it <br/>
&gt; DOES work I will<br/>
&gt; post the results.<br/>
