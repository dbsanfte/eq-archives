<div id="ygrps-yiv-958705572">Bought it last night in Erudin for a whopping 7pp (woot!  The level 48 or <br/>
whatever song he was selling was going for 20pp, hehe)<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a really nice song, but I&#39;m sure it will be nerfed in the next <br/>
patch...  =8^P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes, it&#39;s a party-wide damage absorber (of the &quot;a_mob_01 tries to <br/>
hit you but your magical skin absorbs the blow&quot; variety).  It is playable <br/>
without a lute, but I&#39;m sure using a lute gives you more points of damage.  <br/>
I got it kind of late and wasn&#39;t doing anything so I attacked a newbie mob <br/>
with it on just to see what would happen... hehe<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of cool things about it... It seems to me that they took <br/>
a cleric spell and made it into a song.  When you sing it, you get a LOT of <br/>
different colored particles (just like a high-level cleric casting an HP <br/>
buff on you).  Also, you know that sound that happens at the very end of <br/>
that same clerical HP buff?  You know, the little angel choir that goes <br/>
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; at the end of casting?  Well, that&#39;s the sound you will now hear, <br/>
EVERY TIME THE SONG PULSES!<br/>
<br/>
OK, it&#39;s kind of annoying after a while, but it is kind of cool.  But wait, <br/>
there&#39;s more...<br/>
<br/>
See, when a cleric casts this, it&#39;s an angel choir that&#39;s heard (trust me on <br/>
this one).  When a solo bard sings the song, it&#39;s only one angel voice <br/>
saying &quot;Ahhh!&quot; when it pulses.  And every time it pulses isn&#39;t the same note <br/>
sung (ie. it changes pitch slightly).  But when the bard GROUPS, there&#39;s an <br/>
angel voice for each group member...  Weird, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, get it, play with it, and see for yourself.  It seems to be a very <br/>
useful song.  So what if it only absorbs 45 dmg or so?  It&#39;s cheap, <br/>
group-wide, refreshes when it pulses, has cool particle effects, makes you <br/>
sound like a choir of angels (ok, so maybe that&#39;s a drawback), and it <br/>
requires NO reagents that I have noticed.  Plus it&#39;s a song where we never <br/>
had one before... hehe<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
