<div id="ygrps-yiv-625232107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now I ask you what went wrong? where are my Icy greaves? <br/>
&gt; where is my Silvery Axe? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  From your description of the area, and the level of your group<br/>
  it sounds like you were in the Preacher Dias room.  Which is<br/>
  perfect for a party of low 20s.  While the preacher drops some<br/>
  nice things, you won&#39;t find a war axe or icy legs here.<br/>
<br/>
  That area is beyond the two gates past the flag room.  In<br/>
  the King Throne room, you&#39;ll find most goblins are L20-25,<br/>
  the elites L25-L30, and the named goblins are L27-L33, where<br/>
  King Thex&#39;Ka IV is the highest (hits for double 70).<br/>
<br/>
  The elite goblins will drop the icy greaves, and the elite<br/>
  honor guard will drop the silvery war axes 1h/2h.<br/>
<br/>
  This area requires a minimum L25 full group to tackle effectively.<br/>
  And even then, it&#39;s definitely a challenge until you are <br/>
  around L35.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps, and maybe answered some questions, maybe =)<br/>
  Then again, I could have read your post all wrong.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
