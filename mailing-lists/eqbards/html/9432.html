<div id="ygrps-yiv-945932335">I&#39;ve noticed (not tested) what Galtin wrote to be true.  At 28, if I&#39;m<br/>
grouped with a level 35 and we&#39;re fighting something that&#39;s green to him but<br/>
blue to me (28 definately gets exp grouped with a 35) it appears that I get<br/>
more exp from the mobs than I should sharing the exp with a higher level.  I<br/>
can&#39;t say that I&#39;m getting ALL the exp, but the exp APPEARS to be better for<br/>
me than if we were fighting things that were blue, white, yellow, or black<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is that you still have to be within grouping levels, but<br/>
fighting mobs in your exp range not the higher level.<br/>
<br/>
This would not work, in my experience, with a 33 and a 9 grouped... the 9<br/>
get&#39;s no exp messages no matter the level of the mob.<br/>

&gt; &gt;That is, of course, innacurate (Verrant won&#39;t let something like this<br/>
&gt; &gt;happen).<br/>
&gt; &gt;A high level tank will taunt the MOB off a low level character for him to<br/>
&gt; &gt;kill it. A high level buffer will buff / heal the low level character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But they have to stay ungrouped or the low level one will get no exp.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;I have been told that this is a common method by high level characters<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;If the mob does not give the higher level character experiece, the lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;level one character will get it all.<br/>
