 </span></blockquote>I spent a fair deal of time arguing and debating this with a couple of<br/>
guides the other night.  I was playing my lvl 14 mage to help a<br/>
guildmember catch up to my lvl 20 bard.  We were camped out at the Orc<br/>
Camp in West Common and had this level 17+ character stealing our kills.<br/>
The only reason why this situation was considered harassment was the fact<br/>
that this idiot actually told my group that we had to sell our orc belts<br/>
to him or else he would proceed to kill every orc until he had sufficient<br/>
orc belts for his cause.  After discussing this with a guide, this is<br/>
definitely harassment.  Kill stealing on the other hand is not.  The<br/>
argument that all kill stealers use is the fact that there was no order,<br/>
or I need that item for a friend or the ever favourite well I began<br/>
casting when you attacked.  To me, Verant&#39;s stand on kill stealing is too<br/>
bad it is  a fact of life and hopefully these people will learn later on,<br/>
when no one will party with them.  Well I have yet to see any problem with<br/>
this, I have seen many people who have kill stole consistently and<br/>
predictably have no problems with grouping, in fact they are in a guild.<br/>
So there is no punishment for his actions ever.<br/>
