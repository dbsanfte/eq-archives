<br/>
I tried to build skill by going afk with brass song running but my curiosity<br/>
was so great - I kept coming back to &quot;check&quot; on stuff =)  I noticed that I<br/>
would get more increases if I started and stopped the song than if I just<br/>
let it run. Ymmv. =)<br/>

Brass skill goes up absurdly slow, I have no idea why the programmed it the<br/>
way they did.  I leave my computer on overnight, playing Beserker and it<br/>
goes up 6 pts in 8 hours!!!  It took me three days to get it maxed...</div>
