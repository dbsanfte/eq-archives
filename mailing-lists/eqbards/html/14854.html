&gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Melaniel I saw your post saying you thought you would have to wait on a Sol A<br/>
assault.  I would be pleased to accompany you on an expedition.  I looked for you<br/>
last night but didn&#39;t see you.  Give me a tell in game if you see me or send me an<br/>
email with your playing times =).<br/>
