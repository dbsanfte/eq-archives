<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070136440">Doh!  Must have been 17 when I dueled the shaman cause I remember trying it<br/>
with and without duel wield.  I did better with the shield than I did with<br/>
my scimitar/dirk combo.  15 points of AC seemed much better than the extra<br/>
damage from the scimitar, might do better with a better second wepon but<br/>
would still never win I did only 3 bubbles before I died the best of the two<br/>
fights.<br/>

Hmm, that is very level specific.  Melee them after<br/>
you get your duel wield at 17.  And cast fight the<br/>
ranger after you have see invis at 19 or root and fear<br/>
when you get them.</div>
