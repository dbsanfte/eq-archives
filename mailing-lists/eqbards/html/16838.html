<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606260248">Hehe, you&#39;re right about that. It&#39;s one thing that annoys me about being a<br/>
bard, other than dieing all the time but these 2 factors are linked.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if you have these books in America (I am from England), but when<br/>
I was younger I used to love reading the Asterix books, and the bard in<br/>
those stories was portrayed as a dreadful singer and a clumsy fool. Gives<br/>
me a chuckle as I think Verant based the bard class around that character.<br/>

Ps, I noticed whilst in my local bard guild that the new skills (parry and<br/>
riposte) were there to be trained in. I do however wish bards got an extra<br/>
attack skill for after level 50. We are so poor at fighting, Verant could<br/>
at least give us double attack after 50 levels of suffering without it.<br/>
It&#39;s not like we are gonna be able to solo stuff at that level so why would<br/>
it hurt? It would simply make us deal a little extra damage therefore<br/>
making us more appealing to groups (only problem would be the extra taunt<br/>
from the addittional dmg).<br/>

two-three mobs on me and the warriors can&#39;t taunt them<br/>
off.<br/>

We sing really well...but what are we REALLY good at?<br/>
We are the taunters from hell.<br/>
