<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431190886">I agree with this.  Also, there is a big difference in twinking a character<br/>
that has never played, and twinking one who already has several high level<br/>
characters.  I have a level 27 bard, and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to<br/>
suffer through the wimpiness of low levels with a new character I start.<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not going to give them really incredible items, but fine<br/>
steel, some leather, and some plat certainly takes some of the boredom out<br/>
of levels 1-10.<br/>

&gt;&gt; But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>
&gt;&gt; really enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>
&gt;in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>
&gt;but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>
&gt;of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>
&gt;true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>
&gt;giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>
&gt;into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>
&gt;real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>
&gt;enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I <br/>
&gt;can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>
&gt;why I paid to play EQ.<br/>
