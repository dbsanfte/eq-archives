<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043645310">Have you tried turning sound realism up in the controls? I&#39;ve got an A3D<br/>
card (Turtle Beach Montego) and it&#39;s worked fine since they put the 3d<br/>
sound in in beta 4. I haven&#39;t updated my drivers since then either. The<br/>
realism control in the game defaults to half way IIRC.<br/>

&gt; Sigh.  Every time I hear something like this it reminds me how little<br/>
&gt; support you get from Verant.  I have an A3d card which Verant claims is<br/>
&gt; supported.  However, I do not hear the sounds mobs make outside of combat.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s right, no howling wolves, no chittering beetles, and more importantly<br/>
&gt; no stomping giants.  Every giant in the game can sneak right up on me and<br/>
&gt; pound away to his heart&#39;s content.  It was 3 months before I even knew I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t hearing these sounds till a friend started complaining about all the<br/>
&gt; druids running around howling.  He came over and listened to my system and<br/>
&gt; was shocked.  Needless to say Verant&#39;s support was terrible.  They had three<br/>
&gt; suggestions.  Get the latest drivers.  Done no change.  Turn down Hardware<br/>
&gt; Acceleration.  Done, no change.  Get an SBLive card.  ???  They say the card<br/>
&gt; I have is not only supported, but tested to work as well?  Anybody else have<br/>
&gt; these problems?  Another guildmate of mine has a different A3d card and it<br/>
&gt; works fine.  His is from a secondary manufacturer and mine is from A3d.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d think he would be the one with the problem?<br/>
