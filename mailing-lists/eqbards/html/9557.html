<div id="ygrps-yiv-322978999">This is a problem whenever you have a closed ecomony - stuff comes in - and<br/>
never goes out.<br/>
<br/>
Decay is a pain in the butt - trust me - you DON&#39;T want your stuff damaged.<br/>
<br/>
The solution is to make items components of other items. This is already<br/>
done in rare cases - like to get the screaming mace. It&#39;s voluntary that way.<br/>
<br/>
Making spawn points random - or a certain item drop within a zone on any X<br/>
level critter will also go much farther to help the problem of camping than<br/>
any change they have made so far. No drop is just a bandaid - it&#39;s not a<br/>
cure for the disease.<br/>
<br/>
Players will always take the shortest route to the cheese.<br/>
<br/>
Players will always want something if it exists.<br/>
<br/>
These are not BAD things - you just need other options that are more<br/>
attractive to them than passing down and twinking their newer characters.<br/>
<br/>
Servers go thru growth cycles - it&#39;s predictable from the day one goes up,<br/>
all you can do is provide other outlets for goods and money to take them<br/>
back OUT of the economy. A player that is intent on becoming filthy rich<br/>
and having the best items in the game WILL do so - and there is really no<br/>
reason for him not to - it&#39;s called a goal. <br/>
