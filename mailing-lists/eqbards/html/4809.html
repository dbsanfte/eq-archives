 </span></blockquote>A couple of weeks ago<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I had it loaded in lower guk, and used it when a pull in the undead<br/>
&gt;tower go _way_ more ghouls than normal. (anyone else notice that when<br/>
&gt;someone else stirs up that place and gates it stays stirred up even<br/>
&gt;after they gate?) Usually using an area effect song in that place is a<br/>
&gt;quick ticket out of the place, with it&#39;s buggy z axis allowing casters 2<br/>
&gt;floors down to detect and cast on you, but this time it slept a bunch of<br/>
&gt;ghouls long enough for my party to finish off way more than we normally<br/>
&gt;could have handled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this is true as I&#39;ve only been to the lower guk tower a few <br/>
times, but I have repeatedly been warned to NOT use any spells or songs on <br/>
the bridge area past the stairs leading to the tower, as it it bugged. I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen it happen but i heard the entire tower can be pulled at once by <br/>
doing this?<br/>
