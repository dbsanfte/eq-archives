<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694775758">There are a couple factors that come into play:<br/>
<br/>
1) your level vs the mob&#39;s level<br/>
<br/>
2) &quot;lumpy-ness&quot; of resist levels (175 is prolly not that different from 162<br/>
but 285 is gonna be lots different from 175 - those are sample numbers not<br/>
specific numbers that are &#39;break points&#39; - just that yes, you need to really<br/>
get those resists up there.)<br/>
<br/>
3) the &#39;roll&#39; you get (one or two times - even 6 to 10 times is not a good<br/>
sample - you need to fight the same mob more than 30 times to get a good<br/>
sample.)<br/>
<br/>
Level 60&#39;s resist better than level 54&#39;s (doh!)  They tend to see less<br/>
&quot;help&quot; from higher resist stats and say things like: &quot;I forgot to wear my MR<br/>
stuff and even so did not get feared.&quot;  Well, they still had bard song and<br/>
ench buff and maybe even drank a potion so forgetting gto wear 35ish (maybe)<br/>
points of additional resist was not enough to make a difference on a good<br/>
roll.  As a level 54 cleric with full resist gear, bard song and potions, I<br/>
was thinking: &quot;my level is just too low - I always get feared.&quot;  Then after<br/>
a bunch of times, I started see some &quot;you resist the....&quot; so I guess I can<br/>
get good rolls and resist.  After a bunch of times, even the 60&#39;s are saying<br/>
they want a bard in their group for the added resists.<br/>
<br/>
Who is gonna fight the same dragon 30+ times?  If your guild wants to go to<br/>
Veeshan&#39;s Peak, you will be killing Trakanon 30+ times to get keys for<br/>
everyone.<br/>

<br/>
the point was not that you would be feared or ae damaged or whatever.  the<br/>
point<br/>
was that you would get the same effectivity at about 175 as at about 245.<br/>
<br/>
the way to test this is to have someone get to about 176 in resists and<br/>
compare<br/>
effectivity with someone at 245 in resists.</div>
