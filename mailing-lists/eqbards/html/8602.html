<div id="ygrps-yiv-227775805">In a fit of limelight grabbing impulse (for which I&#39;m well known,<br/>
although I can&#39;t see it myself), I&#39;d like to pose some questions to<br/>
the audience .....<br/>
<br/>
I definitely made a similar post a little while back asking about the<br/>
problems we have with those creatures that just don&#39;t like us singing,<br/>
drumming, whatever while our group is sitting down resting for the<br/>
next fight.<br/>
<br/>
But lately it&#39;s become a problem for me again.  Granted, I&#39;m not the<br/>
highest level going, but I&#39;m entering the nice grouping range at which<br/>
to learn the different tactics as a bard.  My wiz grouped constantly<br/>
all the way through her career, so she learned quite early how to<br/>
survive.  But I&#39;m having more trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting a lot in West Commons.  Those juicy wisps are just<br/>
ripe for the taking, and I&#39;ve made a pot of cash from selling stones<br/>
to the greedy druids and wizards who want to take them a couple zones<br/>
over and sell for a profit.  Tip - ask for 9pp, they can still make a<br/>
profit out of that ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on the few times I&#39;ve actually grouped, it&#39;s usually to fight<br/>
the mean old dervs at their camp.  Now to put this in context, when<br/>
I&#39;m solo, I don&#39;t die.  Actually, sometimes I have died but it&#39;s<br/>
usually when I get greedy and take on 3 wisps, only to be barely alive<br/>
as the last one is nearly dead and suddenly I&#39;m asking myself how I<br/>
didn&#39;t hear that kodiak tiptoe up behind me.<br/>
<br/>
But as soon as I get into a group, I&#39;m dead before I can get off a<br/>
last musical obituary.  Once I even didn&#39;t have my weapon equipped, I<br/>
didn&#39;t bellow, I didn&#39;t do chords, I just sat back, had my drum out,<br/>
and buffed.  And still the dervs didn&#39;t like me.<br/>
<br/>
So my simple question is .... how can I avoid being the centre of<br/>
attention!  In a fight that is, because clearly I need to be centre of<br/>
attention at all other times! &lt;cough&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is it a case of holding off for a little while before doing the songs<br/>
... similar to being a wiz and holding back zapping until the fighter<br/>
types have made the beasts dislike them enough?  I can do that, but<br/>
then it seems a bit daft.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I&#39;m alone in this, and I&#39;m just paranoid or silly or both.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thoughts much appreciated.<br/>
