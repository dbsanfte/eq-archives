<div id="ygrps-yiv-520022514">Heh, that&#39;s all we&#39;d need is monsters popping up in the middle of walls, or halfway in sloped floors, then<br/>
falling into netherspace to attack us with impunity.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad idea, but I think you&#39;re<br/>
oversimplifying the difficulty in implementation.  It has already been demonstrated how fragile the thin<br/>
plane of ground we walk on is.  Certainly with respect to getting things to stay on that ground, and not<br/>
below it.<br/>

&gt; I can think of a couple ways to fix that fairly easily.  Whenever a Mob<br/>
&gt; spawns, just offset its location by a random number in the X and Y<br/>
&gt; directions and pop him to the nearest surface.  This would make the game a<br/>
&gt; heck of a lot more difficult at higher levels where a spawn that pops up on<br/>
&gt; the other side of a wall is suddenly part of a melee in another room that<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t expecting more trouble because everything was &#39;predictable&#39;  Camping<br/>
&gt; a spawn in a dungeon would become really tough if anyone was camping nearby<br/>
&gt; spawns as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just the amusement of have the PGT Mucktail suddenly spawn between the two<br/>
&gt; medd&#39;ing wizards instead of in front of the tanks would be worth the coding<br/>
&gt; difficulty.  This cannot be that hard to code, obviously monsters spawn at<br/>
&gt; fixed locs, just insert a function call to the random number generator to<br/>
&gt; offset the database coords passed to the spawner and you&#39;d be done.  If<br/>
&gt; their design is any good, this should be easy to implement.<br/>

&gt; In all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>
&gt; corner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>
&gt; predictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>
&gt; the same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>
&gt; only things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>
&gt; and exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; virtually impossible to make things challenging - once you<br/>
&gt; figure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>
&gt; challenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>
