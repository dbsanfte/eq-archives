<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397731418">the claw is very nice. i still use a icetooths claw which is almost the same<br/>
damagewise. icepaw war claw also weights 0.0<br/>
<br/>
the crown is a very good bard item imo. far better than ss helm (crap<br/>
effect). int doesnt really matter, since when you get the crown you will<br/>
have your non-combat skills maxed and combat skills use dex (i think) for<br/>
skill increases. i had very good cc-performance with it, but the effekt of<br/>
CHA is still debated. however...<br/>
<br/>
for weaps i also got a sainy&#39;s claw recently in CoM. stats are 6/19 int3<br/>
ac10 piercing. what do you think of it? i could use better damaging weapons<br/>
but i like the 10ac, and the 3 int helps to offset the neg 30 int from the<br/>
crown =P. the look is also nice.<br/>

Betreff: RE: AW: [eqbards] Katanas<br/>
<br/>
I just got a &quot;Icepaw war claw&quot; this weekend in Velektors. If you like the<br/>
freddy kruger look . They are not that bad... 9/24 +3AGI Primary only (could<br/>
have been fun to dual wield)<br/>
<br/>
I also got the Kobold Jesters Crown (ac15 cha30 agi5 int-30 dex-5 wt0.0) Not<br/>
the perfect item for skill increases, but I think I will use it when<br/>
charming. Besides it dont weigh anything, so its &quot;free&quot; to drag around.<br/>
<br/>
Both items dropped in the village. The Crown of a named. and the claws of a<br/>
normal kobold I think<br/>
