<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274645358"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>
&gt;cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>
&gt;that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>
&gt;banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>
&gt;voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Norath isn&#39;t a public place. I can tell you you are welcome in my<br/>
house if you behave and speak according to my rules. If you break those<br/>
rules I can eject you. As long as those rules don&#39;t break overriding laws<br/>
(like discrimination based on race or sex) that doesn&#39;t *begin* to touch the<br/>
area of constitutional rights because it was MY house and you choose to come<br/>
in, and frankly I can ask you to leave for no reason in partiucular. Heh, as<br/>
my house is in Texas, if&#39;n ya don&#39;t I kin shoot ya! Well, not exactly, but<br/>
you never quite know in Texas. :o)<br/>
At any rate, the speech thing is a Red Herring, Norrath isn&#39;t a public<br/>
place, it is owned by Sony/Verant. Heh, try telling you boss he&#39;s a arrogant<br/>
jerk and follow it with that he can&#39;t fire you because you have the right to<br/>
tell him that. *grin*<br/>
