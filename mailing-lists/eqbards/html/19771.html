<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045763198">This is a typical response from a statistics viewpoint - problem is, these<br/>
games aren&#39;t being played by computers - they are being played by human<br/>
beings.<br/>
<br/>
A human&#39;s perception of random is very different from a statistically valid<br/>
random - and therein lies the rub.<br/>
<br/>
Over and over and over again - I see patterns of 3 in EQ.  Drops -<br/>
skillgain - whathaveyou.  Nadda for the longest time - then 3 in a row. <br/>
<br/>
People notice patterns - especially favorable ones.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve advocated for some time is a different look at randomness. Random<br/>
yes - but modified so that within any number of given instances - if a<br/>
positive doesn&#39;t turn up (like a drop) it is subsituted. I once camped the<br/>
SBS for 7 straight hours - killing every single one - nothing - then 3 in a<br/>
row. Why should anyone have to camp for that length of time for one item? <br/>
<br/>
That is one reason some folks term this game Evercamp.<br/>
