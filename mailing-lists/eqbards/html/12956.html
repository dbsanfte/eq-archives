friends (Carrilon+sneak).  I&#39;m thinking with all this talk of the camp,<br/>
now might be a good time to see if it&#39;s worth a high level group&#39;s effort<br/>
to break and hold for experience (given the crowding of solB/lguk).<br/>

Congrats on the EBW, I&#39;ve been wanting one for some time.  My guild leader<br/>
(50 druid) has one of the teeth, and said if I could get the other he&#39;d<br/>
let me have it, but finding a group that&#39;s willing to go with me in is<br/>
rather difficult.  Of course the druid also knows how to solo both maid<br/>
and butler rooms, but he&#39;s not up for spending the time it takes to get<br/>
another fang (i.e. luck was vastly on your side with the drops).<br/>
