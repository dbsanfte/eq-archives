<br/>
A LOT of the comraderie will come from having levelled up with guildmates.<br/>
you&#39;ll spend a lot of time with them.  if you&#39;re in a guild that has the<br/>
numbers and the good people but it&#39;s hard to get a group, you&#39;ll find<br/>
yourself in pickup groups and getting to know everyone but your guild it<br/>
seems.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;then you might be better off checking which guilds have<br/>
the most comparable level players on when your on, rather than which guilds<br/>
have the most members enrolled.<br/>
