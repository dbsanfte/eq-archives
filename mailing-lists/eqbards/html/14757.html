<div id="ygrps-yiv-429686996">My guildmates and I spent a LOT of time in our mid-upper 20&#39;s camping the<br/>
Shadowmen.  Unless I recall incorrectly perhaps even it was low 20&#39;s.  With<br/>
a good harmony puller you&#39;ll find them a great way to get experience,<br/>
mediocre to okay loot; and quest items (I forget which class - wasn&#39;t<br/>
bards - but others in my Guild needed them).<br/>
<br/>
A bad pull will pretty much guarantee death for one or more members of the<br/>
party - but there are reasonably close bind points to most of the SM camps.<br/>
The casters are tough; but I think you&#39;ll find that pulled properly you&#39;ll<br/>
end up netting a LOT of good experience..<br/>

&gt; I think I am missing something- I was helping some guild members with<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; quest when i was lvl 33 or 34- we were fighting shadowmen in West<br/>
&gt; Commons,and they all conned green to me. How would greenies kill a lvl 50?<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; only fought them for a couple of hours and got no xp- didnt care because I<br/>
&gt; was there for moral support :)- but I didnt realize they were that nasty?<br/>
&gt; Was I just lucky? The rest of the group I was helping were mid 20&#39;s as I<br/>
&gt; remember.<br/>
