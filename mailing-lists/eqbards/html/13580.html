&gt; Actually I think there&#39;s more to the &quot;exploit&quot; (bs it&#39;s a bug) than<br/>
&gt; this. I&#39;ve had dragon fear consistantly not stick to me with less than<br/>
&gt; all 15 buff spots filled as well. I&#39;ve had the icon up but still been<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I *think* this is your secondary resist kicking in, just like<br/>
with Pixie Strike.  If you Pixie Strike yourself, you can be<br/>
stunned, outright resist, or fail the initial resist but (if<br/>
you&#39;re high enough level) pass the secondary resist.  That<br/>
puts the icon up but has no effect (other than the MR debuff).  <br/>
I think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with people getting the fear<br/>
icon but not getting feared - you aren&#39;t really feared, the<br/>
icon is just there becuase of buggy implementation.<br/>
