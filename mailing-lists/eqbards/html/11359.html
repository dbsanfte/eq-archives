<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711705184">Currently either A: a bard can&#39;t do it either since levitate does not last<br/>
long enough to loot and Necros don&#39;t get levitate until what level? 39th?,<br/>
or B: anyone can do it as a bard could target the corpse and another party<br/>
member can /assist to target the same thing the bard is targeting, in this<br/>
case the corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Either way it isn&#39;t consistent.  Should a level 4 Enchanter who hasn&#39;t been<br/>
able to buy their Gate spell be left in a solid wall because they can&#39;t<br/>
prove they do not have the spell, and a level 4 Enchanter should be able to<br/>
Gate out of the wall?  But a warrior of the same level would be freed since<br/>
he obviously could not get out?  Such a decision would not surprise me<br/>
actually given my past few experiences.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The area where the incident happened in Sol A is indeed<br/>
&gt;unrecoverable unless you are a bard or necro, or can trust one<br/>
&gt;to loot for you.  The only way in is down a &quot;lavafall&quot; which<br/>
&gt;is high enough that you can&#39;t go back up.  The only way out is<br/>
&gt;by gating or zoning to Sol B.  Once you get in there with<br/>
&gt;levitate, there is no reachable land so you cannot drag your<br/>
&gt;corpse up to the surface.  Since your corpse is in the lava,<br/>
&gt;&gt;snip<br/>
&gt;for you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>
&gt;your corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>
&gt;the original poster was griping about. </span></blockquote></div>
