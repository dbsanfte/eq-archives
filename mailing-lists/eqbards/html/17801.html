<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751442956">But orc hill is in no way within the chase agro range for orcs.  Not even<br/>
remotely close.  I have left agro&#39;d orcs on the hills innumerable times and<br/>
never had one suddenly appear on me.  Wood Elf guards can kill a centurion<br/>
in two to three hits as well.  I could maybe see this happening with a lone<br/>
orc or two, but a stream big enough to keep a group occupied for a while,<br/>
move to top of lift and still die?  Seems highly unlikely at best.  If the<br/>
orcs were spawning within chase range or close I might buy it, but orc hill<br/>
is at least 3-4 times as far away as maixmum chase range.<br/>

&gt; Here is what happened to you.  The Orc you left alive went and told all<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; friends about you and your group (mobs will spread agro when near each<br/>
&gt; other).  As other players killed the orcs you got faction hits for still<br/>
&gt; being on their hate list.  If a orc got close enough to you to directly<br/>
agro<br/>
&gt; (when you are on a mobs hate list the re-agro range is huge) they would<br/>
head<br/>
&gt; for you, in-route they must have gotten stuck on a tree or from lag they<br/>
&gt; appeared to teleport into the middle of you.  They were teleporting up<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; Kelethin as a anti-exploit measure that keeps casters from blasting<br/>
critters<br/>
&gt; from a high places with no fear of retaliation.  The only way to clear the<br/>
&gt; agro is to zone/camp/die, till then the agro will keep spreading.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This happens in the planes all the time, and I had it happen once in lower<br/>
<br/>
I had it happen to me twice long long ago in Oasis.  Was about<br/>
L15 then, and thinking back on it, we must&#39;ve let an orc run<br/>
away.  It was still aggroed to us, but outside the range where<br/>
it would come chase us.  It aggroed other orcs, who do what<br/>
they normally do (pace back and forth).  As they got near the<br/>
top of the far hill, they&#39;d enter the chase-aggro range and<br/>
come running to us.  We couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on<br/>
because all these orcs kept running over the far hill for us<br/>
nonstop.<br/>
<br/>
If this was happening at the orc lift, it&#39;s likely you never<br/>
saw the orcs running towards you because of the Z-axis<br/>
limitation (you&#39;ll notice players/mobs at a different height<br/>
disappear from view a lot sooner than when you&#39;re just far<br/>
away).  When they attacked, it forced a client update, and<br/>
they appeared to pop on top of you.  And like Rokenn said,<br/>
because one had transferred its aggro to all the other orcs,<br/>
you got faction hits for all of them.<br/>
