<br/>
I am glad my short lived burst of speed gave you the inspiration - or at<br/>
least added to it to &#39;beat me to 50&quot; - Grats!!  I keep thinking &lt;boo hoo&gt;<br/>
spectres are green now - nobody will take me to the SS room - I will never<br/>
make 50.  Hmm maybe i should go to Guk and see what John(tm) was able to<br/>
solo.  but then I remember that almost every post where you mention solo in<br/>
the maze on the live side is followed with tips on fear / invis running to<br/>
the zone &lt;grin&gt;  Pass.  But I do believe that I can solo blue DW gobs.  Me<br/>
and a necro were taking them with ease.  Otherwise it looks like Seafurys<br/>
and Everlost Ice (frost? they drop frost giant toes) giants for the<br/>
remaining bubs. Bouncers are green, kobs are green, specs are green &lt;gah&gt;<br/>
We even mounted an expedition to the perma bear caves in search of blue<br/>
mobs.  Heh, we found em. Try 6 blue bears agro early because someones invis<br/>
drops.  Thank god we had 2 enchanters cuz one died.  Oh yeah, you need a<br/>
live gater to get out.  Yes, you can climb the ladder and kill the 2 IG&#39;s<br/>
and the Dragon if she is up and run out thru the lair but gating is easier.<br/>
All in all it was very fun to do some thing that was a risk, and new, and<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you or someone would catch that &lt;g&gt; I dont use it in &#39;normal&#39;<br/>
fights in Hate or other multiple mob pulls.  But I knew Inny would be all<br/>
alone and I wanted to see if I could get it to stick on him.  It didn&#39;t.<br/>
Also, I was guessing I would be playing the hymn and niv&#39;s late in the fight<br/>
and thought maybe string enhancements and all... well I should have used<br/>
Chords of Dischord &lt;g&gt;.  It would be bad to have Inny die to the DoT bug and<br/>
see his corpse poof.<br/>

p.s. overheard in the bear caves...<br/>

Raloon tells the group, &quot;No offense but I really hate bards.&quot;<br/>
Dunk tells the group, &quot;why?&quot;<br/>
Raloon tells the group, &quot;damn bard song drops invis just as i run off to<br/>
have a look&quot;<br/>
Sylly tells the group, &quot;No offense but i really hate enchanters who dont say<br/>
STOP SONG before the cast invis on thenselves and go running around &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bah, I really hate having a puller or &#39;go looker&#39; in the group &lt;s&gt;<br/>
