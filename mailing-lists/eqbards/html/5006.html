<b>Subject:</b> EQ Party!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690736755">Last night I went to the reception hosted by Verant & Sony at Gencon.  It<br/>
was really fun!  They reserved a big room above a popular bar/restaurant and<br/>
it was pretty much full of EQ players - I&#39;d guess 100 ppl at least!  They<br/>
had free soda, beer and food for everyone.  And everyone was standing around<br/>
swapping storys and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Someone pointed out John Smedly to me - he was chatting with different<br/>
groups as were a bunch of other Verant and Sony people.  I joined a group at<br/>
the bar and we talked about EQ and different other games and why we all love<br/>
EQ so much, what is the best video card, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, this one guy in the group has a Verant tee-shirt on and I axe him: &quot;hey,<br/>
do you work for Verant?&quot; He goes you and I axe so what do you do there? &quot;As<br/>
little as possible,&quot; he says. Hehe, but really what do you do? Now, he&#39;s<br/>
giving me a funny look and he says....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, I am the vp of something and the producer of everquest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh my God!  You&#39;re Brad??? &quot;Hail!&quot; Bow!  &quot;Hail!!&quot;  He I am yapping away with<br/>
Brad McQuaid and I don&#39;t even know it.<br/>
<br/>
Some guy mentioned that he liked being on the test server cuz you get to see<br/>
all the new stuff first. To which Brad says: &quot;We are not going to even<br/>
mention pie tins tonight!!! grrrr&quot;  &lt;guess that&#39;s kinda sore subject&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I asked what the new game will be like - and he said it will be a mega-multi<br/>
player strategy game kinda like command and conquer.  You can have games<br/>
with 5 people or 500 people.  He said the 500 ppl games will prolly last<br/>
weeks.<br/>
<br/>
The group talked about pen and paper rpg&#39;s and how EQ relates to that.  Brad<br/>
said he has played a lot of rpg&#39;s and explained to me (who has never) how<br/>
they worked.  You roll dice for every swing and such.  He said that they<br/>
wanted EQ to be a great experience for p&p rpger&#39;s and they want to develop<br/>
and support the same kinda experience with out the real life trouble of<br/>
having to get 7 people in the same room.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him about getting support for player designed and organized events<br/>
and he said they do and will support those. He said they are really working<br/>
on fixing the quests - making broken ones work, tuning existing ones and<br/>
adding new ones.  He said we should be seeing lots more dynamic quests<br/>
happening real soon now.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him about the &quot;lore&quot; and stories of Norrath.  I said we talk a lot<br/>
about how things seem to be related in different ways and we wonder if this<br/>
is by accident or on purpose. He said that the quests will tell the story of<br/>
Norrath and there is indeed a history to be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, he said Cazic (the God in the Fear Plane?) is gonna be &quot;fixed&quot; real<br/>
soon now. So, you high levs better git your killin in while the killin is<br/>
good - sounds like they are gonna un-nerf him.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that we had a great chat about &#39;regular&#39; stuff.  What servers you<br/>
play on, what chars you got, what was your last best loot, which vid card is<br/>
best.  Brad said: &quot;when we started developing this game our pc&#39;s had 32meg<br/>
ram - sheesh - now our vid cards have 32 megs of ram.&quot;  I got the feeling<br/>
that he and the rest of his team are quite dedicated to the game and the<br/>
player community.  I was impressed with EQ before but now I am really<br/>
impressed!<br/>
<br/>
So that is how I met Brad!<br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
Bard of the 20th level<br/>
a.k.a. Robo-Bard<br/>
asleep on her feet<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. what does he look like? Well, if you put all the green armor on him and<br/>
equip the flaming sword - he looks exactly like Aradune! &lt;g&gt;  but w/o the<br/>
armor he looks more like &quot;Scruffy&quot; from Qeynos Hills (I mean that in a nice<br/>
way Brad - really!)  John Smedly would have to be a barbarian.</div>
