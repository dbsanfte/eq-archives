<div id="ygrps-yiv-407637890">The mask is such an interesting item that I have wanted it for as long as I<br/>
can remember. I finally picked one up about a week ago (pre-patch).  I use<br/>
the illusion every time it becomes night in Norrath for the ultravision and<br/>
I dig the +13cha a lot.  All I have to say about this whole nonsense I read<br/>
on the usenet today is that I am very very very glad it was not taken away<br/>
from the bards.  <br/>
<br/>
I am terribly proud to wear my elf-hide gloves, trollhide belt, and guise of<br/>
the deceiver, as these are the only mid-level bard only (well and rogue<br/>
but...) items in game.  Other classes are comparing this change to the box<br/>
of abukar change though and I think there is going to be a lot of stink over<br/>
it, but not on our list of course &lt;grins&gt;<br/>

&gt; Yes, the new mask is truely bard/rogue only.  No more wizards right<br/>
&gt; cliking and getting dark elf look.  Brad even commented on the mask<br/>
&gt; in his infamous Nerf vs. Enhancement post.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What do yo mean by &quot;NEW mask?&quot;  Does the assassin drop a <br/>
&gt; different mask than<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Guise of the Deceiver now?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a boon to ask of ye, me friends.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have need of a better map to the ruins of lower Guk. The <br/>
&gt; maps I have found<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the many cartographers around fail to lead me true.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any help you may offer in this manner would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; [OOC: The maps out there that I have found fail to show the <br/>
&gt; Assassin room. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would love to be able to get there, or near, to get a <br/>
&gt; basalt Carapace to<br/>
&gt; &gt; wear (and perhaps one of the new masks)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was in lower Guk much of last night, and both were up for <br/>
&gt; free loot, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could not find a guide to the assassin room. by the time I <br/>
&gt; did find a guide<br/>
&gt; &gt; (a few hours later), There were only 20 people in the zone, <br/>
&gt; and bad things<br/>
&gt; &gt; were everywhere. I did get greaves and gauntlets. Much <br/>
&gt; better to wear than<br/>
&gt; &gt; bronze]<br/>
