<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615546895">A lore item only checks to see if you have another instance in your<br/>
inventory. When you scribe the song it is no longer a scroll so, yes, you<br/>
could buy-scribe-buy. You might have problems getting rid of the second one,<br/>
though, since lore items cannot be dropped or traded.<br/>

I also got burned by the one lore item limitation.  I tried to buy two<br/>
copies of<br/>
two songs in Kelthin and paid for all four but only ended up with one copy<br/>
of<br/>
each.  I petitioned and was told, in essence, tough luck.  Thanks for the<br/>
great<br/>
documentation Verant.  It appears that this has been corrected a little.  I<br/>
put<br/>
a copy of a song in the bank and tried to purchase another copy and it would<br/>
not<br/>
sell it to me.  Good work Verant.  I still want my platinum back.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if I can buy a song that I have already scribed.  Has anyone<br/>
tried<br/>
that?<br/>
