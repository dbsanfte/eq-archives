<div id="ygrps-yiv-229806150">Ok changing around the TP song to non-zone members has<br/>
a lot of merit.  It would remove any &quot;train&quot; issues,<br/>
but it does not remove PoS issues.  Where does the<br/>
group get teleported in?  Next to the bard?  What if I<br/>
am on the third island?  If the pop in at zoneline,<br/>
then what zoneline?  ie. SolB there are 4 or 5<br/>
zonelines in there.  <br/>
<br/>
You could basically restrict it from non-Plane zones,<br/>
but I was really trying to go for a song that made us<br/>
wanted during plane raids, almost needed in fact. <br/>
Planes &quot;can&quot; be done without enchanters, but its A LOT<br/>
tougher.  I was looking for the same type of thing for<br/>
bards.  I dont want to be invided only to provide<br/>
casters with mana.  I want to be NEEDED.  I want ohhs<br/>
and ahhs when I do something no other class can do.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason I came up with the removing hate list part<br/>
was to stop trains, but I guess its no different than<br/>
a binder aggroing a mob and gating back to bind point<br/>
in the same zone.  I never played a binding class so<br/>
don&#39;t know how this works.  Is the mob still very<br/>
aggro to the caster?  If so then we could have the &quot;in<br/>
zone&quot; part of the song, but have the same problems<br/>
when casters do the same type of thing.  We would just<br/>
have to make sure noone was aggro to anything and deal<br/>
with the consequences if they are.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to look at specific instances, and if you bring<br/>
in members from any zone in the game, you can bypass<br/>
buying the stones for Plane of Hate and such.  If its<br/>
only &quot;in zone&quot; members a wizard still has to gate<br/>
everyone in, but the bard can be sitting in Maestro&#39;s<br/>
room and bring the party there without the party<br/>
having to run around the zone and die a few times. <br/>
Does this make a bard &quot;needed&quot; for raids? nope, but<br/>
players wouldn&#39;t think twice about having you on<br/>
raids.<br/>
<br/>
Again we could restrict the song from certain zones,<br/>
but this is a real cheezy way of doing things and I<br/>
want to be needed in EVERY zone.  The only problem I<br/>
see now is PoS, if it were just restricted in this ONE<br/>
zone that is not a problem.  I see no reason why Hate,<br/>
Fear would need to be restricted.  If they were I then<br/>
Perma and SolB would be next.  <br/>

Ack!  I got this in just as I mailed out my idea on a<br/>
tp song (gathers group from anywhere in the game,<br/>
EXCEPT the zone you&#39;re in)... lemme see if I can<br/>
pretty it up.<br/>
<br/>
Bardo&#39;s Symphonic Gathering<br/>
Instrument needed: Flute (especially so you don&#39;t sing<br/>
it accidentally o)~  )<br/>
Range:  All zones but the one the singer is in.<br/>
While not being a FULL teleport song, it would clearly<br/>
add to a bard&#39;s usefulness without unbalanceing the<br/>
class or a group.  A member drop  from your group?  No<br/>
big deal, send out your group leader to invite someone<br/>
<br/>
else to the group, then bring them back with this<br/>
song.  With the same-zone limitation, there is no<br/>
chance of PoS abuse or threat of creating a train.<br/>
Included would be a message box with yes or no answers<br/>
similar to the <br/>
ones that pop up on a rez.<br/>
