<div id="ygrps-yiv-933097994">I am a bard of the 23rd rank and have been for fartoo long.  I was<br/>
wondering if people know of good areas for xp that are not prone to trains<br/>
and kill stealers.  The standard practice of earning a bubble of<br/>
experience and then losing 3/4 of it to some stupid idiot has become way<br/>
too tiring for me to handle.  Any suggestions for a good place?<br/>
