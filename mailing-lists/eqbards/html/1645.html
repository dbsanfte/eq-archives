<div id="ygrps-yiv-497607136">Well, bloodclaw is a 1h pierce, and rogue/necro/shadowknight only, so I&#39;d<br/>
take that off your list..;)<br/>
<br/>
See if you can find a Jambiya, that&#39;s an excellent bard usuable pierce found<br/>
on a named sand giant in Oasis, 7 damage 26 delay, it&#39;s a bit superior to a<br/>
blw, and has the benefit of being much lighter as well, so you don&#39;t stam<br/>
out nearly as fast.<br/>
<br/>
You outgrow a tomahawk fairly quickly.  The spell effect on it goes up as<br/>
you level, increasing STR, but also decreasing AGI .  After a while, that<br/>
AGI loss pretty much negates the magic skin(which doesn&#39;t go up in the<br/>
amount of damage it can absorb), and keep in mind that while skinned, you<br/>
can still be bashed and run stunned.  Either one stops your songs cold, and<br/>
can get you killed at the wrong time.  Also, the last hit that &#39;blows<br/>
through&#39; the tomahawk shield applies all extra damage to you.  And since the<br/>
damage was computed with the benefit of your lower AC, that last hit can<br/>
hurt.<br/>
<br/>
And quite frankly, the shield is so puny that it won&#39;t even absorb ONE good<br/>
hit from higher level mobs before it fails.  That, combined with the fact<br/>
that the tomahawk is not all that efficient compared to other 1h slash and<br/>
pierce you can aquire in the mid twenties and beyond, means that about the<br/>
time you get one on your own, you should start planning on replacing it.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan knew what he was doing when he created that item, and knew the level<br/>
ranges that would be required to get it.  The tomahawk is roughly the same<br/>
niche as the Bone Bladed Claymore, Chrysknife, Runed Totem Staff, and the<br/>
Screaming Mace.  Good for its level, something to transistion you out of<br/>
combines while you quest for better items, but by no means a weapon someone<br/>
beyond high teens/low twenties should want to use, once they knew about<br/>
better weapons elsewhere.  Even well balanced weapons are more efficient.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Which is better: tomahawk, bloodclaw, or a barb whip?<br/>
&gt;Or is there another good 1hs that I do not know about that a bard can use.<br/>
&gt;WellBalanced does not count.<br/>
