<div id="ygrps-yiv-892035599">Hehe.  Well considering I bugged this almost a year ago in Beta 4 (or was it<br/>
3?), it takes a while for them to fix things.<br/>

&gt; Been hunting in Unrest the last few nites.... my first time there. Died<br/>
&gt; several times the first nite, due to poor groups - my enchanter husband<br/>
kept<br/>
&gt; telling people which thing to kill (he was mezzing the others), but they<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t follow his direction - but later we got a great group going in the<br/>
BK<br/>
&gt; room, and some higher level friends of ours got a group going in the<br/>
Knight<br/>
&gt; room upstairs and were handy to help in case we got in trouble... And,<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; almost the entire server crashed, we were doing great and having much fun!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same on all servers, but on The Rathe,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; skeletons do not have a nametag like all the other NPCs. I petitioned this<br/>
&gt; (first time I ever petitioned anything), because at one point we were<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to fight three or four different skeles, and it was hard to get targeted<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; correct one to fight (and some were having a hard time figuring out how to<br/>
&gt; use the assist command...) - but I digress... I basically petitioned that<br/>
&gt; the skeles get nametags so they would be easier to target and identify,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; an assistant got right back to me (I was impressed) and said he understood<br/>
&gt; my point and was going to request they fix that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now... I was wondering if any of you have gotten such quick response and<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; anyone has ever seen them fix things like that... or if it takes them a<br/>
&gt; while to fix things like that... Just curious what kind of responses<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; have gotten, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Safe journeys all!<br/>
