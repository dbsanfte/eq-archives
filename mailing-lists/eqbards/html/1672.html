<div id="ygrps-yiv-842980225">This is the first time ever I heard of a class complaining about something<br/>
that they have as a bonus.  I think that if you do not like plate then do<br/>
not wear it, but please do not give Verant any funny idea.  I do not mean to<br/>
put down anyone about their perspective of a bard but like most Fantasy book<br/>
if you look, a bard is a very powerful magic class with the fighting skills<br/>
of a rogue with a rapier or a short sword.  I am digressing.  My point is,<br/>
is it not possible that Verant is redefining the role of a bard.  Please do<br/>
not give Verant any funny idea.  I like my Bard as it is except for the<br/>
Hit-list.<br/>

Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have a<br/>
bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me that<br/>
image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>
they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords, magical<br/>
instruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem to<br/>
have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>
we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>
without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>

     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
