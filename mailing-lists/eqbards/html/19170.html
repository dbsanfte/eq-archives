<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoore strategies? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555709128">My guild is planning an event in Mistmoore and I am<br/>
part of the planning process.  Most of the players<br/>
will be mid 20s to mid 30s but we&#39;ll have a few 50+<br/>
folks there too.<br/>
<br/>
Current planning strategy is to line up 3-4 strong<br/>
groups near the zone and have an experienced puller<br/>
(or two) bring mobs to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
THe idea is to open a pathway to those mobs and items<br/>
we want, then move our camping groups down the open<br/>
path and into those areas we want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to mistmoore before....is there a<br/>
better way to do this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
