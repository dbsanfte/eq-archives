<div id="ygrps-yiv-46591433">I just noticed the announcement for the High Moon Festival on Povar.  (for<br/>
those not privy, go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/n_news.html#news0702c">http://everquest.station.sony.com/n_news.html#news0702c</a> )<br/>
<br/>
During this Festival, one of the events will be an &quot;Iron man&quot; race:<br/>
<br/>
                                  Event Name: Iron Man Marathon<br/>
                                  Description: This event is open to all<br/>
races and classes. The race will<br/>
                                  start at the West Gates of Freeport with<br/>
the contestants having to run<br/>
                                  through at least 2 zones to a finishing<br/>
point. Before the race begins<br/>
                                  participants will be told the race route<br/>
and the finishing point. Don&#39;t<br/>
                                  worry, it will be a point that most are<br/>
aware of. The first person to reach<br/>
                                  the finishing point wins the race. To<br/>
make sure everyone starts off on<br/>
                                  even footing all contestants will have<br/>
SoW cast on them in order to<br/>
                                  prevent someone from having an unfair<br/>
advantage. More rules will be<br/>
                                  made available before the Marathon begins<br/>
by the Marathon Coordinator.<br/>
<br/>
                                  Prize: Glowing Crook Staff <br/>
 <br/>
Wow!!! But... um.. SoW, huh?  Is it just me, or can a Bard with a drum<br/>
outrun SoW any day of the week?  Not to mention what we&#39;re hearing about<br/>
this battledrum....<br/>
<br/>
Methinks a Povar Bard will win this competition if he&#39;s smart ;)<br/>
