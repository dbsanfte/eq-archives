<div id="ygrps-yiv-660450175">Whoa. Ease up there Gabriel. Take a look at how many years it takes <br/>
to develop a game like this. Of course they are working on an <br/>
expansion. Otherwise, LONG after the current bugs are fixed people <br/>
would be complaining there were no MAJOR updates cuz the expansion <br/>
would still be a year down the road. Just because they are looking <br/>
ahead and planning expansions to the game doesn&#39;t mean they have <br/>
stopped working on the current issues, they are announcing fixes to <br/>
existing problems every week on EQ vault and EQ Stratics. <br/>
Let&#39;s stop complaining about everything under the sun and give Verant <br/>
some credit for designing the most awesome online game to ever come <br/>
along.<br/>
