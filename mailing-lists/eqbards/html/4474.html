<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923869321"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What do you folks think of bards in general?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I have played several characters and, by far, the bard is my most<br/>
favorite. Reasons why:<br/>
<br/>
1. I&#39;m actually able to play alongside my husband... where before we were<br/>
just playing on one computer (we got a cable modem, two ip&#39;s, and a second<br/>
eq for my new computer).<br/>
<br/>
2. higher level players have given me things... out of the blue, which was<br/>
unexpectedly wonderful AND extremely helpful. I, in turn, have tried to help<br/>
others with &quot;hand-me-down&quot; armor, etc.<br/>
<br/>
3. people tend to love bards.... to quote someone, &quot;... bards rock!&quot; And we<br/>
really do!! This is the most versatile class I&#39;ve played so far, and, I<br/>
think, fairly easy to play. I especially love that songs can be weaved in<br/>
many manners.... variations on a theme, as it were :)<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the post about the &quot;bagpipes&quot; thing. THAT would be fun -<br/>
AND funny!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you think bards will play an interesting role on the new racewar server?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really have no idea as I&#39;m not, at the point in time, planning on playing<br/>
on the racewar server.<br/>

Brangwen, L10 wood elf bard, The Rathe<br/>
(almost L11 [!!]....who died 5 zones away from her bind point last night<br/>
near a bandit camp she had no business being near..... AND whose wonderful<br/>
druid husband was still there, and went all &quot;invisible-like&quot;, looted her<br/>
corpse and then gated back - whew!!!!!!!) hehehe</div>
