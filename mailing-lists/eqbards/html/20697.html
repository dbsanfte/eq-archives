<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087315103"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Looks like I&#39;m in the running for crappiest system on the list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, my specs are almost the same as yours except my vid and sound cards<br/>
are worse, I think my HD is a little slower, and I *just* upgraded to 128<br/>
a month ago.  ;P<br/>
<br/>
I usually go 100% clip plane in the old world (I have gotten used to it),<br/>
30% in kunark, and 0% on any sort of multi-person raid or even some<br/>
really crowded dungeons.  In fact, I borrow a better computer when doing<br/>
dragon/plane raids because turning off all chats, effects, names,<br/>
*everything* I still crash.<br/>
<br/>
I can twist three songs on either continent, but it requires a good bit<br/>
more attention on kunark, which is my new home (can we say carpal<br/>
tunnel?).  I really do seem to be at a disadvantage for my<br/>
behind-the-times system, often.  Nothing like having processor overload<br/>
kill you when you *were* half a zone ahead with selos on. :)  I also have<br/>
a hard time charming, as the timing is skewed by how sluggish my machine<br/>
is at that moment (hence my current hatred of charming).  Forget trying<br/>
to type an important message to a groupmate in Karnor&#39;s--by the time I<br/>
have the words &quot;snare it&quot; out, I have missed out on 2-3 songs, since the<br/>
timing has to be so close down there.  ::sighs:: I *swear* I will upgrade<br/>
someday.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, though, anyone have any suggestions to ease the stress<br/>
on my system that I may not have thought of (besides leaving kunark ;P)?<br/>
