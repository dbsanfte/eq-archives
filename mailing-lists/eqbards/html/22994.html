I like at least a portion of the songs haste being stacking on the other<br/>
haste buffs.  As you say, our songs do urge our comrades to fight better.<br/>
And out of all the options, the one that has a possibility to succeed IMO.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Proposal to change how bard haste songs stack with<br/>
enchanter/sham an haste spells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to run this idea before everyone and get some feedback/recommended<br/>
changes before submitting it to Verant.  I&#39;ve posted it to both the Concert<br/>
Hall board as well as the eqbards mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
I have played a bard since April 1999.  I have followed all bard related<br/>
issues since that time.  I am fully aware of Verant&#39;s position that bard<br/>
songs with haste components are not intended to stack with enchanter/shaman<br/>
haste line of spells.  However, it is my opinion it would be worth the<br/>
effort of the bard community to try to change Verant&#39;s mind one more time<br/>
before the final tuning changes are made.  In the past this might have been<br/>
wasted effort on our part.  However, based on the fact that Aradune<br/>
currently appears to be open to suggestions on how to improve the game, this<br/>
time around we may get better results.  <br/>
<br/>
This entire proposal is based on the rationale that while our haste songs<br/>
have spell-like effects, they should NOT be treated as spells for stacking<br/>
purposes.  Our voices alone inspire our comrades to fight better.  There is<br/>
no &quot;magic&quot; involved.  As a result, a bard song that has a haste component<br/>
(Anthem, Celerity, Berserker, etc) should stack with the enchanter and<br/>
shaman haste line of spells (Augmentation, Celerity, Swift Like Wind, etc).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of ways to do this.  <br/>
<br/>
Option 1).  Apply 100% of the bard haste bonus in addition to the<br/>
enchanter/shaman bonus.  This may be overpowering so a compromise would be<br/>
Option 2.  <br/>
Option 2).  Apply a portion, perhaps 50%, of the bard haste bonus in<br/>
addition to the enchanter/shaman bonus.  For example, Anthem provides a 10%<br/>
haste bonus.  Under this scenario, while an enchanter/shaman haste buff is<br/>
in effect, Anthem would provide an additional 5% haste bonus (in addition to<br/>
the other stat bonuses it provides.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is a lot more radical but I figured I would throw it out<br/>
there as well for discussion.  Each class in EQ is generally considered to<br/>
be the &quot;best&quot; in one aspect of the game.  As we all know, bards are<br/>
considered the best at reducing downtime as well as running speed.  This is<br/>
all fine and dandy and something I can live with.  However, IMO, bards<br/>
should be the best class in the game when it comes to &quot;inspiring&quot; our<br/>
groupmates in combat.  This is an aspect of bards that can be found in every<br/>
piece of fantasy literature relating to bards.  This &quot;inspiration&quot; is in the<br/>
form of haste buffs since they have a much bigger impact on combat than<br/>
primary stat buffs.  So it is my opinion that bard songs that provide a<br/>
haste buff should be BETTER than enchanter/shaman buffs.  You end up with<br/>
something along the lines of this:<br/>
<br/>
Option 3)  Double the current haste bonus of all bard songs but continue to<br/>
enforce the stacking rules with enchanter/shaman spells.<br/>
<br/>
Either of these three options would be something that benefits every class<br/>
in the game.  So in terms of garnering public support, this should be fairly<br/>
easy to do.  The first two options do not impede on the abilities of the<br/>
enchanter or shaman classes in any way so they would have no reason to<br/>
complain.  Option 3 would render enchanter/shaman haste buffs obsolete when<br/>
grouping with a bard but once again these are not &quot;class defining&quot; abilities<br/>
of these classes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the hard part is convincing Verant to adopt either one of the<br/>
three options.  I&#39;m no programmer, but I would imagine the actual coding<br/>
part would not be difficult at all.  I have read reports that the two new<br/>
Ervaj songs, instead of functioning as mana drains, provide a minor haste<br/>
buff that stacks with enchanter/shaman haste spells.  If that is actually<br/>
the case, then Verant already knows how to change the code to make all of<br/>
our haste songs stack.  <br/>
<br/>
So I request everyone&#39;s feedback on this proposal.  If anyone thinks they<br/>
have a better idea that is more likely to get approved by Verant then feel<br/>
free to make a recommendation.  Once I get enough feedback, I will rewrite<br/>
the proposal and post it to both the Concert Hall board and eqbards mailing<br/>
list as many times as necessary until the majority of us agree on its<br/>
wording.  I am also more than willing to let a more well known bard present<br/>
this proposal to Verant.  Who that may be I leave up to the bard community<br/>
to decide.  Kaearia  comes to mind since he has probably done more research<br/>
on how our songs work that any other bard who has played the game.  Thott<br/>
also comes to mind since he appears to know someone who works for Verant. <br/>
