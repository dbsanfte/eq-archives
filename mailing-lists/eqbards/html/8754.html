<div id="ygrps-yiv-539291099">Of course, they were the same three. :)<br/>
<br/>
My Bard visited Halas/Everfrost for the first time last night, the stomping<br/>
grounds of my first character. So much easier to travel with Selo&#39;s! Also<br/>
really felt short for the first time, looking up at all the barbs. Hooked up<br/>
with a 13 Shaman friend of mine and hunted Mammoths a while. He was good<br/>
humored whenever I passed him with cries of &quot;SOW slow!&quot; Carillon brought the<br/>
Shaman vendor by Megan&#39;s tower from dubious to indifferent so I could sell<br/>
to him. It&#39;s becoming my second favorite non-combat song. XP was slow so we<br/>
headed to my favorite train-wreck: Blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a low-level dungeon (only some Commanders conned yellow at<br/>
14) but it felt good to be a big fish in a small pond for a while. I helped<br/>
stop a train of low-level gnolls by wincing the whole group with<br/>
lute-charged CoD. They were falling left and right. Then spent a few minutes<br/>
healing those who needed it. My shaman friend and I held the green room by<br/>
ourselves for an hour. XP came quickly and I started making quips about how<br/>
tame this place was once in your teens. My how quickly fate restores your<br/>
humility! Wish I&#39;d just retain it in the first place!<br/>
<br/>
Getting 15 the first time was very rewarding. A yellow Commander popped and<br/>
we laid into him. Icymugg, (my Shaman friend) poisoned him, which really got<br/>
his ire. I could not taunt him off with CoD, bellow, heal, or Anthem. Too<br/>
stunned to cast, Icy couldn&#39;t escape and I couldn&#39;t save him. As soon as Icy<br/>
died an Elite popped and started thwacking me from behind. But the Commander<br/>
was below half so I pressed on. I slew the Commander to the tune of DING!<br/>
Welcome to Level 15! but was down to 2 bubbles so had to flee. Leaping off<br/>
the cliff 50 feet to the outdoor pool, I activated my Squad Ring with less<br/>
than a bubble and Razorgills chomping. This gave me the boost to Selo to the<br/>
zone. 15 and it was only 12:00! This was too easy, I thought. Yes, it was!<br/>
<br/>
The next hours became hell. Once regrouped at the green room, train upon<br/>
train swarmed us. I thought it odd that trains would come INTO the green<br/>
room rather than start there, though one was brought in by some lost souls<br/>
fleeing in terror. I don&#39;t care what level you are, 15 guards and higher can<br/>
take you down in the blink of an eye. And who do the frenzied puppies choose<br/>
as their first guest? Why, the Bard, of course! Even grouped with more<br/>
people, the berserker gnolls were too much. Everyone finally left from<br/>
frustration and exhaustion, but I just had to get my level back again (like<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be there for me tomorrow!) so I camped the elite ledge til I<br/>
did. Even that was a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
My conclusion: Why would anyone go to BB after 16, when there&#39;s little xp to<br/>
be had, but trains that can waste a 30? I&#39;m not going back again, unless<br/>
it&#39;s to try DDD to kill the low trains for fun. ) As I camped in Halas, I<br/>
checked my spell listing. Where do I need to go for Lullaby? Kelethin!<br/>
*Groan*. In billiards this would be known as a bad leave.<br/>
