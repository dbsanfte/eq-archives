<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807005936">I have a suggestion for any class that uses 1HD Slash weapons...DWARVEN<br/>
AXES!!!! These babies are killer, so long as the creatures u are fighin<br/>
don&#39;t require a magic weapon to hit them.<br/>
Stats are 6Damage and only 26 Speed....and believe me...speed kills. They<br/>
are especially effective in conjunction with Dual Wield. I purchased 2<br/>
Combine Longswords for my trips to Unrest. But, when fightin &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
creatures(i.e. Orcs in High Hold, etx.) the axes are superior weapons, and<br/>
noticablly quicker than the Combines. Best thing about them is that if u<br/>
hang around Kelethin, you will see them for sale almost every day as they<br/>
are found of Lord Darish in Crushbone. I have bought them for as low as 5PP,<br/>
and have never paid more than 10PP...that&#39;s a bargain for what u are gettin.<br/>
So, get combines when u have a chance and if u are fighting many magical<br/>
creatures...but, use the axes for everything else. &quot;Dwarven Axes are the<br/>
Best Non-Magical 1HD Slash weapons in the game!&quot;--EQ&#39;Lizer web site<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hail fellow bards!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think about buying my first magical weapon right now and wanted to know<br/>
