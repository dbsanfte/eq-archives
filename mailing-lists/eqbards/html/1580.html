Greetings everyone! I am a new list member, and I am glad to see that this<br/>
list is active! I began playing a wizard, and then switched to a bard to see<br/>
if it was any fun or not...I haven&#39;t played the wizard since&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I also run a fanfiction site for EverQuest.  The site carries fanfiction<br/>
from all races and classes, but I&#39;d like to begin a bard section...we are,<br/>
afterall, the musicians and poets of Norrath..let&#39;s put it to good use!<br/>
The site addy is:<br/>

I have been looking on the internet for good sites on our songs...none seem<br/>
to be good enough.  Does anyone know of a website that has the details on<br/>
all of our songs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
