<div id="ygrps-yiv-730152016">yes.  not me yet, but many who have put in the time to rebuild their faction<br/>
have, even as far as completing the Yelinak/Dain head quest with Tormax.  i<br/>
have not been playing myself on raids, either my wife&#39;s 54 cleric or my<br/>
friend&#39;s 60 warrior.  if both of them aren&#39;t at the raid, i am playing one.<br/>
so i don&#39;t know where i am faction-wise.<br/>
