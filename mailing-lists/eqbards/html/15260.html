 </span></blockquote>Hey, thanks.  I didn&#39;t know there was a spike at the minimum<br/>
damage.  I hadn&#39;t separated the piercing from the slashing<br/>
damage, and assumed the second spike was the modal damage for<br/>
the Dirk.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another note.  If you&#39;re looking at hit %&#39;s something<br/>
&gt; to consider is how does the combat formula work with<br/>
&gt; respect to dodge/parry/riposte?  My presumption is<br/>
&gt; that A checks for a successfull hit against B, then if<br/>
&gt; successfull B gets a dodge check, if it fails, a parry<br/>
&gt; check, if it succeeds a riposte check.  If this<br/>
&gt; supposition is correct then d/p/r&#39;s would count into<br/>
&gt; your chance to hit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, yeah, didn&#39;t think of that.  I just used the number the<br/>
parser gave me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely interested.  What did you write your parser<br/>
with?  Any chance I can get a copy?  I wanted to take a look<br/>
at the damage from some of my friends and the necro pet.<br/>
