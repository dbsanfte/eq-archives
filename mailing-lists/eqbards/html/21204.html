<div id="ygrps-yiv-627143699">crescendo is actually less haste than celerity by a little.  if your tanks<br/>
already have a haste item, use crescendo because their haste will max<br/>
anyway, and AC+STR is better than +AGI.<br/>
<br/>
for a mantle, if you like ac (and hit points are nice too) go to burning<br/>
woods and grab a tattered mantle.  gullerback is 50+ so you may not be able<br/>
to kill him, but the people in the zone may let you loot one, or like you<br/>
said the guild can go kill him.  he used to be extremely common when kunark<br/>
came out, dunno if they changed that, but he drops the mantle everytime.  if<br/>
buying they are cheap anyway, i think 200-ish.  it is ac12 20hp 10disease.<br/>
<br/>
for a cloak, you can&#39;t get up to an HBC or cloak of shadows with that amount<br/>
yet, but a simple upgrade to your cloak is either white-wolf hide,<br/>
lizardscale, or even a cloak of the icebear, which is the highest ac and<br/>
cheapest of the 3.<br/>
<br/>
for belt, i don&#39;t think you will find higher ac, or at least can&#39;t think of<br/>
one.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Which means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo soon.  When <br/>
&gt; i am the haster<br/>
&gt; (IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which i LOVE, <br/>
&gt; the agi buff<br/>
&gt; gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask since its <br/>
&gt; high level<br/>
&gt; song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str boost I <br/>
&gt; think the haste<br/>
&gt; effect is the same)<br/>
&gt; (This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>
&gt; Beserker.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and shoulders.  What do you all<br/>
&gt; reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists, CHA, and <br/>
&gt; STR (in that<br/>
&gt; order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me looted it <br/>
&gt; not knowing it<br/>
&gt; was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted bronze cloak <br/>
&gt; (UGH!) and a<br/>
&gt; straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have about 2k <br/>
&gt; right now and<br/>
&gt; dont really have trouble making money, though I would rather <br/>
&gt; go get a guild<br/>
&gt; run to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>
