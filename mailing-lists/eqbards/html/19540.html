<div id="ygrps-yiv-551569354">Just recently bought a pair of singing steel boots myself and I paid a<br/>
nice round 2k for them.  I still feel it&#39;s a lot of money for a pair<br/>
of shoes, but it finally breaks up that damn blue I&#39;ve been getting<br/>
bored with ;-) <br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I get the things to give me some water,<br/>
right-click doesn&#39;t seem to work??  Not sure I want to drink something<br/>
that&#39;s been so close to my feet when I&#39;m wandering through swamps, but<br/>
it&#39;s the thought that counts!<br/>

&gt;Saw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he<br/>
&gt;can get 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a<br/>
&gt;guild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>
