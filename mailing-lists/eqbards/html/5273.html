&gt;&gt;I have decided to make it my goal to attain a staff of writhing<br/>
&gt;&gt;Problem is I dont know where i can find one or about how much they sell<br/>
&gt;&gt;for. &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They Do look awesome..I wear a combination of Charred and bronze plate and<br/>
get told all the time how impressive it looks..I also wield a silvery 1h axe<br/>
in my other hand (half elf female bard).  The staff usually fires 2-3 times<br/>
per round for me..add it up...hmm 18 for bellow 48 for staff reg damage on<br/>
axe averages 18..another 20 or so for the blunt damage from the staff..not<br/>
bad for a bard AT ALL. On my server they can go for as much as 1000plat..or<br/>
as little as a friends good wishes.  A wizard  friend of mine made a<br/>
creative deal for his..he agreed to port the person who gave him his<br/>
anywhere for the entirety of a level whenever she asked!  If your level 32<br/>
or up a trade of the mana song for a level or two might help......<br/>
