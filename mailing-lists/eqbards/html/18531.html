<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522714889"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If you aren&#39;t getting from a guild what you want, then you should<br/>
&gt;leave.  All the better if its to a guild which will give you what you<br/>
&gt;want/need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*whew* I am glad someone said that. I am in my guild because I know for a<br/>
fact that when I log in it will be greeted with a chat-box full of &quot;Hi<br/>
Tszaaz!&quot; followed by several hours of verbal harassment and merciless<br/>
character assasination as well as incidental grouping with people I know<br/>
aren&#39;t foos, or at least aren&#39;t foos in some new surprising manner. As you<br/>
might guess we have some high-40s and one or two 50+ but the rest are<br/>
totally random collections of races/classes. When I find a guild with more<br/>
jerks I MIGHT be tempeted, but I will have less dirt on em than I do these<br/>
yahoos, so I will probably stay.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just depends what you want from the game, but there IS always a<br/>
choice here, about how you want to play, I am just glad the game is so r0x3n<br/>
without all that, erm, intruige and politics I see in the Uber-guilds.<br/>
