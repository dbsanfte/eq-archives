<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194959275"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When I look at #13 from the King Room, I always thought that this depicted<br/>
&gt; the defeat of a former King at the hands of the Goblins, perhaps prior to<br/>
&gt; the Nagefen raid from #8?  The gold is a crown.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Man, you are absolutely right... that is a crown.  I never saw it<br/>
  before until I looked really close at it.  Funny that this picture<br/>
  comes from the king room.  Again, why would kobolds depict on their<br/>
  walls their own demise?<br/>
<br/>
  Is it possible that these tunnels were created by goblins?<br/>
<br/>
  And the goblins had a war with the fire giants and nagafen,<br/>
  lost and retreated?  Then the kobolds came and took over this<br/>
  area?  It would explain why there are so many paintings about<br/>
  the white creatures (goblins).  Still there are many <br/>
  inconsistancies.  Maybe the goblins conquered the previous<br/>
  kobold king.<br/>
