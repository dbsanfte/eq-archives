I&#39;m enjoying this discussion, as it is helping find the purpose in all the<br/>
music that is taught in the guild. I used to think the the Lament was<br/>
useless. Now, I use it fairly regularly.<br/>
<br/>
I can offer two good uses for the Jig o&#39;Vigor:<br/>
    1) Excellent party combat song. As you get higher in rank, and find the<br/>
        necessity to group more compelling, you&#39;ll also find that the creatures<br/>
        you fight take longer to kill. Now, I can assure you from experience<br/>
        that the warriors in your group will look VERY favorably on a song that<br/>
        will lessen the drain on stamina, as swing large hammers, axes, and <br/>
        two-handed swords can wear them out in a long battle.<br/>
     2) Recovery for Dancing the Yellow Beetle. If you&#39;re using the Run/Heal <br/>
         or Run/Bellow tactic of combat, you&#39;ll ususlly find that in a<br/>
drawn out<br/>
         battle you get tired eventually, thus lessening your frequency of hit<br/>
         with your weapon, and lowering its damage. The Jig is a great backup<br/>
         for putting the spring back in your step right before you turn to<br/>
whack<br/>
         at that very large borer beetle again.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Not really, it&#39;s sort of useless.  Sometimes when running very long <br/>
&gt;distances,<br/>
&gt;&gt; you will lose stamina.  Also, if you are without food and drink you may lose<br/>
&gt;&gt; stamina at a very increased rate.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not too good.<br/>
