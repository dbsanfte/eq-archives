Gee Galtin, I am glad I went to Freeport and got Anthem and Bellow finally<br/>
last night, but it sounds like you had a very interesting evening in the<br/>
Faydark!<br/>
<br/>
I have heard about the Crookstinger wasp for some time, but only in rumor as<br/>
all the people I ever spoke to about it had never seen it before.  Even<br/>
rangers have spent a long time waiting around lfaydrk to get this named NPC<br/>
wasp on tracking to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about the Crookstinger is that its stinger can be used as a magic<br/>
attack weapon:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The crookstinger is found an a named Wasp in Lesser Faydark. This is a good<br/>
low level magic weapon as it can be obtained at &lt;10 levels. It has a damage<br/>
of 4, a delay of 21 and also has a weak poison effect. &quot; - taken from:<br/>

<br/>
It seems logical to me that attacking lots of giant wasps is what causes<br/>
this NPC to spawn although I have never thought of it before.  Be careful to<br/>
keep this thread within our little bard list or suddenly in a few days you<br/>
will hear &quot;auctioning crookstinger dagger, 3pp, give tell&quot; all over the<br/>
gfaydrk zone ;-)<br/>

&gt; Sorry about posting off-topic but for some reason I have <br/>
&gt; email access but<br/>
&gt; not Internet access. As a result, I can&#39;t post this question <br/>
&gt; on EQVault.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was <br/>
&gt; attacked by the<br/>
&gt; Spider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never <br/>
&gt; seen this NPC<br/>
&gt; before so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we <br/>
&gt; killed a lot of<br/>
&gt; giant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, <br/>
&gt; after we killed<br/>
&gt; her, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  <br/>
&gt; Right-clicking on<br/>
&gt; the item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mention anything<br/>
&gt; like Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever <br/>
&gt; heard of this<br/>
&gt; item.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking <br/>
&gt; it may be a<br/>
&gt; quest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison <br/>
&gt; sac from the<br/>
&gt; Queen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking <br/>
&gt; like a kidney.<br/>
&gt; My guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used <br/>
&gt; by a rogue to<br/>
&gt; create poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been <br/>
&gt; implemented yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP <br/>
&gt; but if its<br/>
&gt; part of a quest would like to try and solve it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>
&gt; night.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named <br/>
&gt; fairie whose<br/>
&gt; name I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In <br/>
&gt; addition to the<br/>
&gt; Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  <br/>
&gt; There were several<br/>
&gt; groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures. <br/>
&gt;  The general<br/>
&gt; consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these <br/>
&gt; creatures caused<br/>
&gt; Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>
&gt; enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant <br/>
&gt; has started to<br/>
&gt; beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar <br/>
&gt; additions in other<br/>
&gt; zones?  <br/>
