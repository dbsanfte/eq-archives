<b>Subject:</b> Patch in general(was Changes to Root/Snare) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-502225883">This is the whole patch and some general discussion from Alan and Brad.  I<br/>
like the idea of more xp bonus for grouping and certain underused dungeons.<br/>
I agree we will see how exactly &quot;Working as intended&quot; is defined this time.<br/>
<br/>
Snip from Alan:<br/>
We&#39;ve got a lot of changes planned for the next patch. Changes for hybrids,<br/>
a change to the way that movement spells work (specifically Root), and a bug<br/>
fix for Lure spells (among many other things). First and foremost I want to<br/>
explain the fix to Lures. Right now (before the patch), creatures that<br/>
should not get a save versus Lure spells are getting saves based on their<br/>
levels. This has been broken for a while. We fixed it on test before<br/>
Christmas, but this is the first patch since then, and the fix should go<br/>
live with the patch. Basically, Lures will become less resisted after the<br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
The changes to hybrid disciplines and powers are as follows. Hopefully these<br/>
will be the last.<br/>
<br/>
1) Resistant Discipline will last five minutes instead of one minute.<br/>
<br/>
2) Holyforge Discipline will lasts five minutes instead of two minutes.<br/>
<br/>
3) Sanctification Discipline will last fifteen seconds instead of ten<br/>
seconds<br/>
<br/>
4) Lay on Hands will have increased healing for each level after forty of<br/>
the paladin. After forty it will do approximately twenty points per level<br/>
more (for levels 41-60).<br/>
<br/>
5) Normal Harm Touches will save as all or nothing. There will be no partial<br/>
resists.<br/>
<br/>
6) Harm Touch will increase ten points per level for levels one through<br/>
forty. From levels forty-one to sixty it will increase thirty points per<br/>
level instead of twenty<br/>
<br/>
7) The Harm Touch discipline will increase Harm Touch damage by fifty<br/>
percent instead of twenty-five percent<br/>
<br/>
8) Weaponshield discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br/>
<br/>
9) Leechcurse discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br/>
<br/>
10) Deftdance will have its duration increased from ten to fifteen seconds<br/>
11) Puretone will have duration increased from two to four minutes<br/>
<br/>
12) Hybrids will no longer reset weapon timers after casting a spell<br/>
(further explanation below)<br/>
<br/>
13) Trueshot discipline damage calculations will be changed (further<br/>
explanation below)<br/>
We will also be giving Hybrids a new spell at level fifty.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the further explanation:<br/>
<br/>
Trueshot damage was messed up. Basically it was giving low damage bows too<br/>
much damage and high damage bows too little damage. We are making the damage<br/>
more in line with the base damage of the bow. This will reduce the damage of<br/>
the discipline for some and increase it for others, depending on the type of<br/>
bow you were using.<br/>
<br/>
As for the timer/casting thing... As it is now, casting a spell while using<br/>
a<br/>
weapon will cause your weapon swings to be delayed by the casting time of<br/>
the spell. So, making up numbers here, lets assume you would swing your<br/>
weapon every ten seconds. If you were to cast a five second casting time<br/>
spell directly after a weapon swing, then your next swing would occur<br/>
fifteen seconds after the last one (adding the five seconds for the spell).<br/>
For hybrids, this will no longer happen. So if your weapon takes ten seconds<br/>
to swing, spell casting will no longer increase that swing time.<br/>
<br/>
Movement Rate Changes:<br/>
<br/>
We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works.<br/>
Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means<br/>
that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That&#39;s the<br/>
primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change.<br/>
<br/>
Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that<br/>
enhance movement.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that this will be seen as a &#39;nerf&#39;. However, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break<br/>
root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br/>
<br/>

and snip from Brad:<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
Well, we&#39;ve been giving all of this (the downtime issue) a lot of thought<br/>
(as have you all). I&#39;ve been thinking about the issues in two separate<br/>
contexts: 1. What could be done with EQ to make it better in this area? and<br/>
2. What could be done in the future to make MMOGs but probably not to EQ.<br/>
<br/>
So, focusing on #1 for the time being, here are a few things we might try<br/>
short term:<br/>
<br/>
1. The post that probably disturbed me most (actually, I didn&#39;t respond to<br/>
it because I wanted to give it more thought) was the one that claimed many<br/>
classes could advance more efficiently soloing than in a group, but that<br/>
soloing inherently involves more boring downtime, so therefore we encourage<br/>
boring downtime for those who want to play efficiently with that subset of<br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, EQ has always been a game focused on grouping, with a subset of classes<br/>
that could solo if the player chose, but soloing was supposed to be slower<br/>
and probably less exciting. No, we don&#39;t &#39;hate&#39; the solo player or some<br/>
such, but we think it might be impossible to make a great grouping and great<br/>
soloing game (oh no, I probably just started a new gigantic thread with that<br/>
one -- if so, please start it somewhere else so we don&#39;t get too confused,<br/>
thanks). So, we designed most of the game in terms of balance and content<br/>
around grouping. But, if we&#39;ve erred and some classes can solo and gain<br/>
experience more quickly than were they to group and these players feel<br/>
therefore compelled to solo when they might be happier grouping, then we&#39;ve<br/>
goofed up.<br/>
<br/>
To this end, we are seriously considering significantly increasing the<br/>
grouping experience bonus, where the more people in your group, the bigger<br/>
the exp. bonus you get.<br/>
<br/>
2. Risk vs. reward, especially in dungeons. One of the very easy ways we<br/>
could &#39;revamp&#39; underused zones would be to increase the experience you get<br/>
across the board in that zone (in case some of you didn&#39;t know, there&#39;s<br/>
simply an experience modifier field in each zone header). What does this<br/>
have to do with downtime? Well, it indirectly helps out, because one would<br/>
advance more quickly in these dungeons, and one could also recover<br/>
experience loss due to death more quickly in these zones. For example, would<br/>
low to mid level players head to Najena were that zone to give out<br/>
significantly more exp.? (Yes, that&#39;s a question to all of you)<br/>
<br/>
3. Lastly, we may consider more teleport spots, perhaps with soul bound<br/>
keys. Maybe. My inclination is no, but we&#39;re going to seriously debate it<br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and on a semi-related note, many of you have concerns over our<br/>
announcement of our plans to revamp old world zones using techniques similar<br/>
to Kunark and Velious. Though Absor alluded to this, I wanted to be very<br/>
clear: this does not mean necessarily increasing the difficulty. Our attempt<br/>
in general will be to keep the style and difficulty levels of the old world<br/>
zones pretty much the same. We realize that old world zones, Kunark zones,<br/>
and Velious zones are different also in difficulty and types of groups<br/>
required to adventure in them. I think this is a good thing -- players with<br/>
different play styles, time available, etc. can focus on different areas of<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
What we want to do with many of the old world zones is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Adjust the experience gained (as mentioned above).<br/>
Randomize existing loot (to hopefully help camping issues)<br/>
Completely re-do pathing from scratch on some of the bad ones (Mistmoore<br/>
comes to mind). We know more about pathing now, and MAYBE we can make some<br/>
of these tricky dungeons better -- but no promises (we can&#39;t change the<br/>
geometry, after all).<br/>
Add some cool quests.<br/>
Anyway, these are our thoughts going forward, but nothing is set in stone<br/>
yet, so we&#39;d love your feedback as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Interesting huh?  I got these through an email from a friend so I am not<br/>
sure where they came from.  Hope this sparks some discussion.<br/>

&gt;It is pretty bad when I read something like this and think &quot;Great, now our<br/>
&gt;chaining songs are going to be messed up because they forgot to test it on<br/>
&gt;bards&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing this does demonstrate is that &quot;movement&quot; type spell effects can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;segregated...so why can they move bard song into a class of its own?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I really dont consider this a nerf since Verant has been saying for 2<br/>
&gt;years that bard songs should NOT break root.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lago<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would agree that it would be nice if Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain wouldn&#39;t <br/>
overwrite Snare as well. While it has a &quot;snare&quot; component, it does have a <br/>
much shorter duration. I would think the complication is that if Snare took <br/>
precedence over Consonant Chain, then I would think that Snare would also <br/>
suppress the ATK SPD debuff of Chain as well.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that I doubt they&#39;ve thoroughly tested it. It will be a pleasant <br/>
surprise to see this working &quot;as intended&quot;. We&#39;ll have to double check the <br/>
health levels that mobs stop fleeing at as well with Chains.<br/>
