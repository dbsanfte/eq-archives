<div id="ygrps-yiv-369249494">your problem will solve in some time when you get better equip. then you<br/>
will have more STR and weight reducing bags so its no problem to carry<br/>
around many parts of armor.<br/>
personally, i always carry many parts with me, and switch depending on game<br/>
situation. when i know i need AC i wear the SS helm, when i am CC and have<br/>
to mezz/charm i wear the kobold jesters crown. same with rings<br/>
(stats/resists/ac) bracer (resists/ac/stats) and boots (SS for effect,<br/>
imbrued for stats and resists).<br/>
in general, i would suggest going for stats, because you will mostly not be<br/>
beaten on. and if you get hit, the ac will not matter that much. so wear the<br/>
imbrued helm for good CHA and leave the SS helm in bank. you also have less<br/>
weight then.<br/>

Betreff: [eqbards] Armor<br/>
<br/>
Dilemma...I have some Singing Steel, and I have some Imbrued.  Problem is,<br/>
the pieces duplicate.  Example, I have SS helm and Imbrued helm, SS arms and<br/>
Imbrued arm...etc.  What is considered &quot;better&quot;?  SS is real nice AC, but<br/>
it&#39;s leaving my stats lacking.  Imbrued has some pretty good stats, but at<br/>
the cost of some AC.<br/>
<br/>
Some have mentioned they carry 2 sets of armor.  I&#39;d rather not do that,<br/>
since I quickly get encumbered now as it is.  Currently, my &quot;fresh from the<br/>
bank going out to do stuff&quot; weight is around 80/113.  Add some armor to<br/>
that, and I&#39;ll be starting out encumbered.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I really need to look at my shoulder, back, and waist slots.  My<br/>
shoulders is still blood stained mantle, back is, I think decent, but don&#39;t<br/>
know what my options are, and my waist is the Straw Spun Belt.  Decent AC at<br/>
10, but at 6 weight, I think it&#39;s too heavy.  I wouldn&#39;t mind options that I<br/>
could go and get myself solo, but I have a 51 shaman friend who can help.<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m 50, finally.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Any and all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
