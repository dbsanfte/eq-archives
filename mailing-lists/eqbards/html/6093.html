&gt; &gt; It may be one of those skills that doesn&#39;t go up<br/>
&gt; &gt; except upon success.  I spent a half hour running around with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a level 1 monk wondering why he was rarely hitting for more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than 1 point of damage when I finally got the &quot;You have become<br/>
&gt; &gt; better and hand to hand (1)&quot; message, after which it went up<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty quickly.  (Doh - remember to train at least one point<br/>
&gt; &gt; in each weapon skill.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could believe this.  What I was suprised by was not so much that my HtH<br/>
&gt; skill wasn&#39;t increasing, but that none of the other combat skills were<br/>
&gt; either...  I suppose I could understand Dual Wield not going, since I had<br/>
&gt; my second hand occupied, but Offense?  I&#39;ll have to try it more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, you can &quot;dual wield&quot; fists, even with instruments equipped, I do it all the<br/>
time.  You were probably just suffering from EQs fine &quot;random&quot; number<br/>
generator, which seems to be anything but. :)  I also smithed for a long time, and<br/>
would get *long* successions of failures, (which I expected, this is smithing,<br/>
after all) followed by several successes in a row.  Very annoying...<br/>
