<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093877866">I can relate to this too.  Could it be that Hell levels dont exist anymore?<br/>
Im in 45. This morning I got 2 blue bubbles in 45 in less then an hour and<br/>
half.  And half of that time i spent screwing around dot kiting and then<br/>
headed to karnors into captain group with a full group (all of which had<br/>
many levels higher then me).<br/>

Probably seems that way, because you&#39;re used to the usual crawl.  Maybe once<br/>
you&#39;re used to this, it too, will seem painfully slow.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...heh.<br/>

I played in Karnors last night with a warrior, cleric, monk, and <br/>
ranger... all I have to say is I earned as much exp in the two hours <br/>
I was there last night as I had in 6+ hour camps before (and the <br/>
group was not any better.)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else think maybe the exp is now coming too fast?<br/>
