<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092940947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There is absolutely zero chance of using Lament, how could <br/>
&gt; that possible<br/>
&gt; help the Enchanter not get attacked?  Did you mean Lullaby?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually meant largos melodic Binding *laughs* THAT won&#39;t break mezz and<br/>
builds mob hate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Even with our high taunt factor, the songs I was <br/>
&gt; singing weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; effective enough to warrant more attention from the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Largos will help, you get all that time to build it while they are mezzed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not in my nature to be solely a defensive presence, and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
&gt; have the tools to do that job anyhow except vs. casters.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly, versus casters. It&#39;s a hard transition but the first time you save<br/>
your groups but at the Giant Fort in the Frontier Mountains when it<br/>
accidentally snags a goblin caster you will be much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What are good defensive tools against melee mobs?  The Damage <br/>
&gt; shields seem<br/>
&gt; weak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They help, particularly on fast meleeing mobs. Each hit they take 6 damage,<br/>
that builds up over time.<br/>
