<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498495565">I just don&#39;t understand how lore items will work.  Was thinking the dirks<br/>
would look great dual wielded, but it&#39;s a lore item so I can have only one?<br/>
But what about quests where you must have multiple lore items in your<br/>
possesion?  Will they be changed, no longer lore items?  Now that I will be<br/>
using a dirk, will this mean if I accidentally talk to an npc in such a way<br/>
that they hand me a lore item, it will destroy my weapon?  Or will these<br/>
&quot;keep only one&quot; only apply to items that are pending lore?<br/>
<br/>
With a rapier and a dirk I look sort of silly, would be nice to wield two.<br/>
