&gt; enable people to drag a corpse without being able to loot it.  If that&#39;s too<br/>
&gt; &#39;unrealistic&#39; for them, why not do the following:<br/>
&gt; /trust allows someone else to drag and loot your corpse.<br/>
&gt; /consent allows someone to drag and loot your corpse without suffering<br/>
&gt; penalties<br/>

home of my erudite necro, I tried to help an enchantress to get her<br/>
corpse back from the city (deathtrap :).<br/>
The strange thing was that she gave me consent but when I tried to drag<br/>
I got &quot;You dont have consent to summon the corpse&quot; (!). Looting did work<br/>
and she got everything but a bag with a no drop item.<br/>
A guide/gm showed up on her petition and summoned the rest of her corpse<br/>
and stated that its a bug in paineel.<br/>
Well, this shows that imho there is already seperated functions for<br/>
summoning and looting so it should be VERY easy to stick a /function to<br/>
it :(<br/>
