<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939017965">By higher, do you mean 50+, or is there significant bonuses in the mid 40&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve got a Symphonic Saber (11/23), and a Sarnak Skullsplitter (12/26).<br/>
I&#39;ve switched them between hands, and really don&#39;t see a whole lot of<br/>
difference, except the SS proc, which my will is insufficient for...hehe.<br/>
Just to try it, I put Sainy&#39;s Claw (6/19) in primary, and Symphonic Saber in<br/>
secondary, and it took roughly half again as long to kill stuff as with the<br/>
Symphonic Saber and Sarnak Skullsplitter equipped (I judged by how far a<br/>
feared sabertooth tiger was able to run when there were little to no resists<br/>
to chains or fear).  Hardly scientific, I know, but I&#39;ve been more involved<br/>
with making the xp bar move, than anything else.  :)<br/>

That is generally true, although the damage bonus does not become too<br/>
significant until higher levels.  At level 32 in your case, you should<br/>
switch slots.  By the time you get high enough level where damage bonus<br/>
is significant, you will have a better fast weapon than your Sainy&#39;s<br/>
Claw.<br/>

I have always heard (my bro is a ranger and follows the ranger board<br/>
closely) that you want your fastest weapon in your primary to be able to<br/>
get<br/>
your damage bonus as often as possible and that in your secondary slow<br/>
ratio<br/>
is what you want to follow (as your secondary does not get damage<br/>
bonus).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using a 6/19 in primary (Sainy&#39;s claw) and a 13/26 (Flameweaver) in<br/>
secondary.<br/>
