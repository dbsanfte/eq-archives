&gt;&gt; &gt;I would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and<br/>
step<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;back from the fight to avoid the shit list effect) with my mandolin.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Once again, when we&#39;re getting hit in excess of 60 points per swing, even<br/>
&gt;&gt; with my 11 per tick with a lute, it&#39;s not worth the loss of my blades.<br/>
Dead<br/>
&gt;&gt; mobs give you plenty of time to heal.  Live ones don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;re in a good group, everyone should be taking damage.<br/>
&gt;If everyone is wounded, and if the song heals just 5 points<br/>
&gt;per tick with your weapons equipped, for a six person party<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s 30 points of healing per tick, which can substantially<br/>
&gt;offset even 60 points damage per swing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, when you get hit as an individual twice in 2.5 second round, 4 times<br/>
in a tick, in the 60 point range, Hymn has negligble effect.  I do 6 per<br/>
tick standing without an instrument, plus the natural 1 point regen.  That&#39;s<br/>
7 damage healed per tick.  A tick is 5 seconds.  84 hitpoints per minute.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our fights last 45 seconds or less, so if I sang Hymn full time<br/>
that&#39;s 54 points damage healed per member.  One hit from the monsters we<br/>
fight.  Not singing Hymn in lieu of another song, such as Melodic Binding,<br/>
is much more effective.  With Melodic binding, I probably stop that mob from<br/>
making half a dozen swings.  Proactive damage avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
We have a good group, and we try to spread damage as much as possible, but<br/>
it&#39;s just better if I don&#39;t sing Hymn in combat now.  It was great when we<br/>
were bashing gnolls and orcs and goblins in the single digit levels, less<br/>
great in the teens, and a pretty obsolete tactic after 20th.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any right answer to which songs to use.<br/>
&gt;It all depends on the circumstances.  Figuring it out is the<br/>
&gt;fun of playing a bard.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Switched to an old standby instead..Lucid Lullaby.  I&#39;d rather the caster<br/>
&gt;&gt; not cast, than take my chances resisting the spell.  Lullaby does an<br/>
&gt;&gt; excellent job interupting the casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another use I found for Lullaby is saving your party when a<br/>
&gt;hopelessly red train gets dumped on it.  The song *really*<br/>
&gt;pisses off the monsters, so you fire it up until you have<br/>
&gt;their attention, then hit accelerando and lead them away from<br/>
&gt;your party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good tactic, but not something that can be done indoors, nor even in most<br/>
outdoor dungeons.  For getaways now, I use the 26th level song, Appalling<br/>
Screech.  Area fear song, clears a room in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I heard the maximum number of mobs affected by it was limited<br/>
&gt;to 4 for playbalance reasons.  I have no problem with that,<br/>
&gt;but it seems to me that even when the song is already working<br/>
&gt;on 4 mobs, it still gets other mobs nearby (who are not being<br/>
&gt;affected by the song and are normally non-aggressive) mad at<br/>
&gt;me.  It&#39;s hard to keep calm when 4 mobs are beating on you and<br/>
&gt;3 more join the fray, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m certain about this.<br/>
&gt;But that&#39;s the impression I&#39;m getting of how it works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s correct, all bard AoE (and most AoE spells in general) have a maximum<br/>
of four targets now.<br/>
