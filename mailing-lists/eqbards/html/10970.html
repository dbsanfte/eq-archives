I hate what they&#39;ve done to Kithicor. I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a <br/>
50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and <br/>
someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to <br/>
zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like <br/>
in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have friends <br/>
to gate them out of there when they have Runnyeye/Beholder on one side and <br/>
Kith on the other.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully Paineel will be something cool and different and worthwhile for <br/>
higher levels. I think it MIGHT be opened by the end of the year. The orc <br/>
highway you are talking about - I always thought that would be a good place <br/>
for another zone myself. Maybe it&#39;s supposed to go to the Rujarkian Hills <br/>
like it shows on the atlas? I think it should lead to a badlands <br/>
(non-desert) type of place. Would be nice. There are a ton of places on the <br/>
Norrathian Atlas they can add that have yet to be implemented (and most <br/>
probly never will). The Dead Hills near Feerrot sound interesting. =)<br/>

&gt;Possibly, but they&#39;ve never met each other face to face, have they? ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope it turns out very well for you folks. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m glad I won&#39;t get level 50 for another year or so. :)  Maybe by then<br/>
&gt;there will be a lot more things to do, and places to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I happen to like trying to get through Kithicor now.  I&#39;m level 19, but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;still die in a heartbeat if one of the undead happened to get a hold of me.<br/>
&gt;I like having a zone I actually worry about getting through safely.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;become one of those zones parents tell their little children about to scare<br/>
&gt;them. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t say there IS things for level 50&#39;s to do, I said there SHOULD be.<br/>
&gt;:)  I know there&#39;s hardly anything to do.  I&#39;m on Tunare, and the number of<br/>
&gt;people in the high 40&#39;s up to 50 is getting to be rather insane.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Something does need to be done, and done quickly.  Zones zones zones.  That<br/>
&gt;is the ONLY way to solve the overcrowding problem.  Maybe they should think<br/>
&gt;about hiring 5 more people and getting them to work on zones exclusively.<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s plenty of areas where a zone would fit nicely in the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have a subterranean zone with an entrance in the Qeynos sewers.  (Some<br/>
&gt;workers were repairing a wall, when &lt;crack&gt; the floor opened up, and they<br/>
&gt;fell into a deep chasm.)  Populate it with some sort of cavern dwelling<br/>
&gt;beasties.  Possibly have a zone inside this one.  Have the initial one for<br/>
&gt;mid-levels (15-25 or so maybe), and have the deepest section of it enter a<br/>
&gt;new zone, for 30+.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would say something on Odus, but Paineel is supposed to open one of the<br/>
&gt;decades, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s going to be another high level zone, if I<br/>
&gt;remember correctly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s one spot in the Oasis that looks like it&#39;s a valley, and should <br/>
&gt;lead<br/>
&gt;somewhere, but it doesn&#39;t.  Is that going to be a new zone someday?  If <br/>
&gt;not,<br/>
&gt;they could put one there.  Maybe the &quot;home of the sand giants&quot; or some <br/>
&gt;such.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Damn, I should work for Verant.  I&#39;ll whip up these zones myself, dangit!<br/>
