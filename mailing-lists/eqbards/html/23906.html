&gt;Syndrome) and I did absolutely NOTHING.  Literally.  Halana is 59 = no<br/>
&gt;focus, no torpor, no malo... also she does not have a vp hammer, so my buffs<br/>
&gt;are low level and mana inefficient.  Clerics have bp heals... and not even<br/>
&gt;gonna SEE what happens if I try to slow Dain *grins*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, in my guild, bards are invaluable on large raids, but they become<br/>
&gt;specialists, twisting resists mostly... which probably feels like<br/>
&gt;&quot;uselessness&quot; to a bard who is used to playing varied roles.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, it&#39;s not feelings of inadequacy (honest!, heh).  supposedly one of the uberguild<br/>
leaders has a &#39;&#39;source&#39;&#39; within verant who said that resists over 175 really have no<br/>
tangible effect.  for most resists with decent equipment and the proper buffs i can<br/>
get to 175 without bard songs.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I think class value on a large raid depends on a combination of factors:<br/>
&gt;level, class, and often, equipment.  In my opinion, Hybrids (including Bards<br/>
&gt;here) are made by their gear.    Give a ranger their epic swords and its<br/>
&gt;like the game has been reinvented for them.  Give a shaman her epic spear<br/>
&gt;and *yawn* goodie, a mediocre dot... changes nothing.  Just a couple<br/>
&gt;examples from my limited perspective.   <br/>
