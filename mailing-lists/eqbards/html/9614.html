<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When were corpse decay times changed?  I thought only the time<br/>
&gt; you had to get an experience res was changed?  AFAIK, they<br/>
&gt; still last 8 hours online or 7 days offline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was a change a while ago - I forget the nitty gritty.  It was was for<br/>
multiple corpses of the same character.  They disappear much quicker.<br/>
Perhaps only if they have no items on it.  I&#39;m not sure if it was on the<br/>
patch message - or an excerpt of a usenet post from Brad.  I recall reading<br/>
this off of EQVault.  It was explicitly stated from Verant directly that<br/>
they are having problems with too many items on the servers and have to take<br/>
steps to reduce it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Unlike UO, there&#39;s a limit to how many items each character<br/>
&gt; can have.  You have your personal inventory, bank inventory,<br/>
&gt; worn items, and that&#39;s it.  Assuming you have all your<br/>
&gt; inventory full of 10 slot backpacks and chock full of items,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s 160 items per character.  Call it 180 to account for<br/>
&gt; worn items.  Assume all 8 character slots are used in this<br/>
&gt; manner.  That&#39;s 1440 items per player.  Assume 5000 players<br/>
&gt; per server all doing this, and that&#39;s 7.2 million items as a<br/>
&gt; close-to-worst-case scenario.  If each item has 1k of data<br/>
&gt; associated with it, that&#39;s roughly 7 GB.  My PC&#39;s hard drive<br/>
&gt; is bigger than that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only 5000 per server?  That seems WAY low to me.  The active servers average<br/>
just under 2000 players simultaneos in peak times.  Verant says they have<br/>
250,000 subscribers.  How many servers are there - 12?  If evenly<br/>
distributed that would be 20,000 per server.  But we know the users aren&#39;t<br/>
evenly distributed.  And how many CHARACTERS on averager.  This database<br/>
discussion is based on characters not players.  How many characters does the<br/>
average player have.  How many people buy the game and have quit.  How long<br/>
do they stay before being purged.  So my estimate is (worse-case server)<br/>
<br/>
30,000 player accounts - and average of 4 characters - 120,000 characters -<br/>
So by my estimate we&#39;re adding 164 GB not 7.<br/>
<br/>
Now even if is 7GB and not 164GB - comparing to your PC&#39;s hard disk to a<br/>
Database you&#39;re comparing apples to oranges.   My experience is with<br/>
commercial DBMS that support transactions and two-phase commits.  Verant I&#39;m<br/>
sure uses a properietary scheme that&#39;s tuned for speed  But regardless A 7<br/>
GB increase can be a HUGE problem.  We are expecting a seemless world where<br/>
everything seems to happen in real-time.  I&#39;ve worked with 7 GB databases<br/>
(and we&#39;re talking about a 7 GB increase to a much larger databases here)<br/>
Searches on it  - even indexed properly isn&#39;t instananeous.  This is a VERY<br/>
significant change. (Thus is the point I&#39;m trying to make)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There are only a thousand or fewer &quot;named&quot; mobs with special<br/>
&gt; drops in the game.  If you assume 5000 players per server, and<br/>
&gt; a 1000 mob bitfield, it&#39;s only 5 megabits, or about 625k of<br/>
&gt; extra data for the entire server.  I made a similar suggestion<br/>
&gt; to the UO dev team (for different reasons) and the problem<br/>
&gt; there was that this stuff is handled via a high level<br/>
&gt; scripting language; so you can&#39;t have a bitfield - a boolean<br/>
&gt; takes 1 byte minimum, probably more.  I agree it would be a<br/>
&gt; monumental task to graft it into the current system.  I was<br/>
&gt; thinking more in terms of future games (in case anyone on the<br/>
&gt; list finds himself as a programmer in such a game :).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re agreeing with me here!  My main point is many people are making these<br/>
suggestion with an unreasonable expectation that they could (and should!) be<br/>
implemented by Verant right away (not implying you are anyone else on the<br/>
list is one of them).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given up reading alt.games.everquest - because there are so many people<br/>
that post a game suggestion (with a subject line of BRAD READ THIS!) with a<br/>
suggestion that often is an excellent (and often boneheaded) suggestion that<br/>
would require a complete rewrite of the code.<br/>
<br/>
I see many posts all over the place from people that complain that Verant<br/>
&quot;ignores them&quot; and &quot;doesn&#39;t care&quot; and are &quot;stupid programmers&quot; because they<br/>
don&#39;t treat all 120,000 customers like they are the only one....<br/>
