<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717666278">Sar I dunno about Bards, I&#39;ve never bothered with Yaks myself ;)  But as a<br/>
Ranger I can guarantee that a Y&#39;kesha vastly out damages a wakizashi.<br/>
Rangers have done a lot of testing of log files, combat durations, solo<br/>
fights, what they can and cannot kill with the various weapons etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to re-hash those discussions here but suffice to say the<br/>
Y&#39;kesha, every time, out dammaged the Wakizashi by enough that we all agreed<br/>
that we were better off with a Y&#39;kesha over a Wakizashi.  The Wakizashi&#39;s<br/>
dmg output is not significant enough during a fight to out-dmg a y&#39;kesha<br/>
once the Y&#39;kesha procs.  Remember, Rangers have Dual Wield AND Double<br/>
Attack, so they tend to proc more often than us when using them.  My Ranger<br/>
proc&#39;s between 3 and 5 times a fight.  So 3*70 or 5*70 additional dmg.  Many<br/>
rangers average higher (My ranger&#39;s dex is horrible (&lt;80)) and I still<br/>
regularly proc 5 times a fight.  A ranger with 100 dex will *regularly* proc<br/>
between 4 and 7 times a fight. Sometimes more.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!  As I said the rangers discussed it.  The numbers may be different for<br/>
Bards since we don&#39;t have Double Attack or the Rangers THAC0 table and thus<br/>
hit a LOT less often.  But I suspect people will find that the Y&#39;kesha will<br/>
still edge the Waki&#39;s out in dmg.  Though not by nearly as much as it did<br/>
for rangers.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears up my post ;)<br/>

&gt; My prime reason for chucking my yaks is the taunt factor. I am usually on<br/>
&gt; larger raids lately where any taunting onto me is usually not a good<br/>
thing,<br/>
&gt; and best kept to a minimum (i.e., &quot;an ire ghast feels the force of ykesha,<br/>
&gt; an ire ghast hits YOU for 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hits YOU for<br/>
&gt; 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hi....a_purple_cleric says to the<br/>
party,<br/>
&gt; &quot;aw geez there goes my mana&quot;...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than that they weigh half as much as a Ykesha, they are no drop (no<br/>
&gt; worries of them slipping between the cracks of my hotkeyed inventory<br/>
boxes),<br/>
&gt; and yes they DO look nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as damage comparisons: I have to completely disagree with the<br/>
notion<br/>
&gt; that Yaks will SIGNIFICANTLY outdamage Waks even if you only get 1 proc.<br/>
&gt; Waks will generally do more damage OVER TIME. This means little if you are<br/>
&gt; fighting short battles. In longer fights (such as against 45+ mobs) the<br/>
proc<br/>
&gt; vs. wak ratio debate loses steam. When you go to the planes almost all of<br/>
&gt; these factors come into play. You are dealing with mobs that have upwards<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; 12K hp. Most fights are quite long, the majority of Ykesha procs are<br/>
&gt; resisted, and the Yaks suck stamina quite nicely in long drawn out fights.<br/>
&gt; Of course any bard with his mandolin will twist Jig in as needed in any<br/>
&gt; fight. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I fully agree that it&#39;s personaly preference. Some people live by the<br/>
proc,<br/>
&gt; others live by the ratio. After having been beat down more than enough<br/>
times<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; let me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; about keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Agreed, the Claws are far better until 28 when the Staff begins to Proc<br/>
;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Once it starts to proc, especially with a good Dex, then you can switch<br/>
;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;But in the meantime don&#39;t neglect your 1h blunt skill!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As to the point about the Wak or Yak...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A LOT of discussion went into these on the Ranger&#39;s boards.  If you<br/>
aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;worried about the Taunt of the YAK then that is definitely the way to go.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Even though it has a lower dmg curve the Proc causes the Yak to out-dmg<br/>
&gt; &gt;(rather significantly) the Wak, even if it only proc&#39;s once during a<br/>
fight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;However, the dmg loss isn&#39;t significant to outweigh the greatly reduced<br/>
&gt; &gt;taunt factor if that is a major concern for you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A lot of bards opt for the Wakizashi because:<br/>
&gt; &gt;a)  Taunts less<br/>
&gt; &gt;b)  Looks nicer<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s really a personal choice.  I almost never use weapons myself so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;not<br/>
&gt; &gt;that concerned ;)<br/>
