&gt; better equipped to be puller than they are.  Just because you have tracking<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make you a good puller.  I&#39;d rather have Accelerando, Lament and<br/>
&gt; Bellow for pulling, and Lullabye for when things go badly...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your group doesn&#39;t have a SOW&#39;er, I&#39;d definitely agree. Having someone<br/>
who can get back without being half-dead is invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
However, if your group does have SOW, you have to realize that rangers<br/>
have harmony (vastly superior to lament, AE lull, rarely resisted), bows<br/>
(faster trigger) for pulling and you can /still/ do lullaby when he gets<br/>
back to the group. =)<br/>
<br/>
Most of your strengths work just as well whether you&#39;re pulling or nice...<br/>
using charm to pull casters is nice though. =)</div>
