&gt;Party says &#39;Who gets it?  Someone who can use it.  No casters<br/>
&gt;             and the bard doesn&#39;t need it.  Here Warrior.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s too bad the ppl you hang out with feel that way...I mean sure a warrior <br/>
needs it more than a bard, but you should be in the order somewhere.<br/>

&gt;Who in their right mind is gonna give a bard a Ykesha or fbbs?<br/>
&gt;Twinked:  someone handed those items to the person through guild<br/>
&gt;connections.  Plus going on their knowledge alone, I would say<br/>
&gt;they didnt earn them (or someone bought an Ebay account, muhaha)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the confusion. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - if they didn&#39;t EARN it that&#39;s a different story. I just do the job <br/>
I&#39;m supposed to do and eventually things come around full circle. I <br/>
definitely think I&#39;ve earned everything I own. I think I&#39;ve earned an fbss <br/>
too, just waiting for the bastard to drop it, however I WILL put myself <br/>
below melee types in loot order unless they are late-comers to the camp. =P<br/>
