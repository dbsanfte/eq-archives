<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036982278">&lt;&lt;As far as powerleveling - I guess my only experience there is on the<br/>
helping side with my bard. A 20something bard - at the right camp, with<br/>
lullaby - is a newbies first and bestest friend. My husband calls himself<br/>
permanewbie - he tends to get really frustrated around lvl 15 and start all<br/>
over again. Many is the time I&#39;ve used the generic bandit camp in lesser<br/>
faye to help lower level friends train - starting, oh...bout lvl 7 or 8 -<br/>
just as soon as they can hit the blasted things. Pull with a bellow and<br/>
just lullaby, bard hate at it&#39;s finest. Since they can&#39;t hit me, they can&#39;t<br/>
hurt me - and they hardly ever switch targets to that little bug biting<br/>
their backside. Can do the same thing in Crusbone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as powerleveling is concerned, the best song that I found for doing<br/>
so is Chains..  When I used lullaby, it didn&#39;t agro the mobs enough and they<br/>
killed my newbie friends over and over.  When I finally leveled high enough<br/>
to get chains, I found out this both agros better (I can cast once on sever<br/>
creatures, and they&#39;ll pretty much stick on me) and I can keep them slow for<br/>
when they run away.  :)<br/>
