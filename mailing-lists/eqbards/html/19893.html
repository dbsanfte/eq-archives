What skills did the casters, or the druids attain that they would need<br/>
trainers for?<br/>

Uhh like I said, our &#39;skills&#39; Parry and Riposte<br/>
didn&#39;t come till 53<br/>
<br/>
NOBODY made 53 during the beta ;)  At least none of the bards did.<br/>
<br/>
So there was never a need for a trainer ;p<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;Why do the others have them&quot;<br/>
If I had to hazard a guess:  Because there are a shitload more of them than<br/>
there are bards.  My real answer though is:<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care, really don&#39;t need one there anyway&quot;.  There&#39;s a<br/>
song vendor.  I personally don&#39;t see a need for a bard &quot;Trainer&quot; neither do<br/>
most folks.<br/>
<br/>
HEH that&#39;s the last time I answer a question here.  Tired of the flames.<br/>
