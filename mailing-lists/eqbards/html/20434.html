<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] RE: Newbie bard race to 12 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492371152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My big plan for 12 while soloing is still hymn & warsong.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m guessing<br/>
&gt; Bellow beats CoD (especially with weapons) so I&#39;ll through <br/>
&gt; that in as a<br/>
&gt; third song.  Or should I focus more on offense and sing <br/>
&gt; warsong & bellow and<br/>
&gt; occasionally hymn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on the mob. Mobs that knock me out of songs a lot (like skeletons<br/>
and monks) force me to constantly change the order of my song playing. At<br/>
all cost I keep warsong going, and as stunning allows I am doing some combo<br/>
of Hymn/Bellow. Against blue skellies here is what I ended up doing:<br/>
(about to pull)<br/>
Hymn<br/>
Warsong<br/>
Bellow (to pull skellie)<br/>
Bellow (if I could fit it in)<br/>
(Skellie has arrived)<br/>
Warsong<br/>
Bellow <br/>
Bellow<br/>
Warsong<br/>
Hymn <br/>
Bellow<br/>
<br/>
repeat...<br/>
<br/>
but it all depends on the race between my health bar and the skeletons.<br/>
Sometimes I risk a bit of defense (hymn) to get a lead by singing only<br/>
warsong/bellow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hymn - during battle if no healer, between battles irregardless<br/>
&gt; CoB - if caster heavy group and I&#39;m not tanking<br/>
&gt; warsong - if caster heavy group and I am tanking<br/>
&gt; anthem - melee heavy group<br/>
&gt; CoD - in battle & with hymn if additional mobs show up and <br/>
&gt; start picking on<br/>
&gt; a caster, or when pulling to get a mobs attention faster, or <br/>
&gt; in battle if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve switched to my lute to heal someone<br/>
&gt; Jig - between battles when you get a caster that swears it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; affecting mana<br/>
&gt; and you&#39;re too tired to argue.  Usually I&#39;ve got Lament in <br/>
&gt; that spot anyway.<br/>
&gt; I rarely use either.<br/>
&gt; E Rhythms - in place of CoB in caster heavy groups where I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; not tanking, in<br/>
&gt; place of hymn otherwise.  CoB/Hymn would still be that third <br/>
&gt; song I&#39;d try to<br/>
&gt; fit in if possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now where should Bellow be used?  And do you see anything <br/>
&gt; drastically<br/>
&gt; wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, expect there is no such word as &quot;irregardless&quot; (it&#39;s &quot;regardless&quot; or<br/>
&quot;irrespective&quot; sorry, personal pet peeve :o). I would take the time to beat<br/>
down the casters on the jig thing though, that is one urban legend that has<br/>
to die.<br/>
In a group I am only using Bellow once I have fulfilled my obligation to the<br/>
group&#39;s well being with Anthem/Hymn. I sing hymn in battle always, but I<br/>
have been grouping with warriors/monks who can both taunt the mob off me, I<br/>
am not sure what will happen in a caster group. But with as few hp as<br/>
casters have, I bet I have to sing it there as well. I have not had to sing<br/>
Jig yet at all (except while practicing swimming :o) I keep asking the<br/>
warriors and monks how they are doing on stamina, but no one reports<br/>
problems. If I get a PGT I will have to start using it, but I am thinking it<br/>
would be better to save up for an obsidian shard.<br/>
