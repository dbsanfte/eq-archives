<div id="ygrps-yiv-249178548">This is my first e-mail so I hope it&#39;ll get to its destination. I&#39;m only a<br/>
newbie bard (lvl 2) :) so I can&#39;t give advices about that. I would just like<br/>
to say that you have to be carefull with files that you dovnload because<br/>
there are new versions of Backorifice (I think that Backorifice 2000 is the<br/>
latest) and netbus. This new versions can&#39;t be decetded by some older<br/>
antivirus programes so if you aren&#39;t sure if your antivirus can detect them<br/>
download bodetect and netbus detector from internet. As I sead before I&#39;m<br/>
new here so I&#39;m sorry if you allready heard this and offcours I hope you<br/>
don&#39;t mind if my english is a little bad because it&#39;s not my first language.<br/>

&gt; It is possible that someone hacked into your account.  There are password<br/>
&gt; cracking programs out there.  Not sure about EQ, but they are around for<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; things.  You might want to make sure you don&#39;t have a crackable password.<br/>
&gt; Where I work, we had a hacker problem and we were told to use a<br/>
combination of<br/>
&gt; letters and numbers, and not to use a common name, or any variation of our<br/>
&gt; name or userid&#39;s in the password.  Think of things that might easily be<br/>
&gt; guessed and DON&#39;T use that.<br/>

&gt; &gt;A copy of a post I have just made to Usenet for information (and a few<br/>
&gt; &gt;notes of sympathy and support for a poor bard losing all her stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be appreciated ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The story begins ....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sunday night, after a reasonably successful day my wizard returns to<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport, does her bits and pieces in the city and then returns to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;West gate to camp for the night.  Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>
&gt; &gt;at about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Monday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>
&gt; &gt;take out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Norrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;out for a run.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Strange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>
&gt; &gt;maybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Strange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;park here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Even stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>
&gt; &gt;growing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Immediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>
&gt; &gt;also naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>
&gt; &gt;enter the world as my wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Same routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>
&gt; &gt;disappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>
&gt; &gt;my computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>
&gt; &gt;is safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>
&gt; &gt;outside of this room.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>
&gt; &gt;not on both my main characters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>
&gt; &gt;explanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>
&gt; &gt;consent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>
&gt; &gt;persons unknown.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>
&gt; &gt;a queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>
&gt; &gt;tech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>
&gt; &gt;tech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;provided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;promptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>
&gt; &gt;killing the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>
&gt; &gt;money, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;time for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>
&gt; &gt;account was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt;only hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>
&gt; &gt;demonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;hopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;game.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>
&gt; &gt;continues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>
&gt; &gt;for tonight at least.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>
&gt; &gt;what has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt;bit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>
&gt; &gt;explain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>
