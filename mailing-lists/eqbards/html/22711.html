.Ok, Velious installed, parched and activated: <br/>
Druid ring/circle and Wizard gate/portal spells for Iceclad Ocean are found<br/>
in NK at the gypsies. They are level 34 spells like the Combine Ones. <br/>
It appears ( I forgot to grab /locs on both portals) that the Druid and<br/>
Wizard spells take you to the same location in Iceclad Ocean Zone. A note,<br/>
when I ported in with my level 35 Druid, I was immediately attacked by blue<br/>
/con mobs. My level 48 Wizzie was not attacked, but I think that is because<br/>
nothing was near the porter &quot;shack&quot; when I zoned in. The mobs /con green to<br/>
the Wizzie. <br/>
Barge to the Gnomish Icebreaker is caught in NRO at the new pier, just south<br/>
of the Barbarian Fishing Village. Barge then zones into Iceclad Ocean and<br/>
drops you off on an empty island. You then need to run accross the island to<br/>
the other side to catch the Gnomish Icebreaker. You can&#39;t miss the dock.<br/>
Icebreaker ride takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get you to the mainland. <br/>
Once you disembark from the Icebreaker, head left to the Gnomish Outpost.<br/>
One vendor there sells some of the new Velious Spells. I only saw 1 for each<br/>
class on him (except Bards had 4, go figure, hehe), and I was under the<br/>
impression that there was 2 for each class. So, as of yet, I don&#39;t know<br/>
where the other set is (if infact, there is another set). <br/>
That&#39;s it for now folks.</div>
