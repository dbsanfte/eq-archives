&gt; I have several customers that I would like to cast See Invoice on.<br/>
Despite<br/>
&gt; repeated mailings they still claim that they &quot;never got them&quot;.  I have<br/>
come<br/>
&gt; to suspect that the Invoices have somehow become invisible in transit and<br/>
&gt; are actually in their in boxes.  Can you tell me where this song/spell is<br/>
&gt; found?  It sounds like Ak&#39;Anon or Erudin libraries perhaps?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A possible theory I&#39;ve heard so far (also mentioned by<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone here) is that there are mobs that cast see invoice<br/>
&gt; &gt; on others. </span></blockquote></div>
