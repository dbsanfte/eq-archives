<div id="ygrps-yiv-976102616">All this PoF info is great.<br/>
Anyone have any good PoH strategies.  I&#39;ve been twice now.  Once went fairly<br/>
well, once was a dismal failure with not a single mob killed.<br/>
How are people &quot;breaking in&quot;?  Is there a safe place to camp?  Are people<br/>
using the alley close to the zone in point, or is there somewhere better?<br/>
