#1) Other characters, so I can play with my RL friends.  Right now, I have <br/>
a Cleric, and I&#39;m enjoying the heck out of it.  When I get bored of combat, <br/>
I just sit back and heal everybody that comes my way.  Makes me feel <br/>
useful.  Last night, I saved the same guy 4 times, and in the process <br/>
gained half a bubble because I managed to get the kills on some blues he <br/>
was tanking.  heh - And I was trying NOT to gain experience ;)<br/>
<br/>
#2) Asheron&#39;s Call.  I agree - I like it for the soloing, but I am also <br/>
disappointed by the models and lack of creature variety.  The creatures <br/>
aren&#39;t as vibrant, but the world looks nicer.  And I like the fact that I <br/>
can solo.  Really.<br/>
<br/>
#3) A girlfriend.  &#39;nuff said.<br/>
