And thanks, btw. Glad you warned about the spoiler too - folks, please <br/>
follow suit, if you&#39;d be so kind. I&#39;ve read a couple of things <br/>
inadvertently that I enjoyed reading, and was grateful for knowing, but <br/>
were spoilers - and I would wager my cat&#39;s remaining genitals that some <br/>
people&#39;s wrath will be incurred if this practise continues.<br/>
<br/>
Can I just say now that it&#39;s a hell of a blast playing a Bard? Lvl 13 and <br/>
it&#39;s been a hoot so far. Unfortunately, we do have a handful of pretty <br/>
crappy songs and I&#39;ve not got much to look forward to for a while. I don&#39;t <br/>
play as often as I&#39;d like, so sometimes a week goes by before I level. Or <br/>
so it seems. But isn&#39;t this a bit of a shame? I feel like some of them were <br/>
just thrown in because they didn&#39;t know what to make up. Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
At least we kick pretty good ass... so far! I do a fair amount of dmg <br/>
(using a shiny-happy-whistling Mino Axe) and combined with bellow it adds <br/>
up to a hefty world of pain on whatever beastie I&#39;m whacking. I enjoy the <br/>
idea of a warrior-bard - a hardened and world-weary bard with something of <br/>
an attitude, and I&#39;m seriously considering making a Bard on the PVP server. <br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many there... at least I&#39;d not die too much, because <br/>
I&#39;d flee like speedy gonzalez if I was losing the fight, but it&#39;d also be <br/>
interesting to see how Bards stack up against the folks in there.<br/>
<br/>
And now, a question about Kiting. I&#39;m always grouped and on the move so <br/>
I&#39;ve not had a chance to really try this out... How exactly do you do it? <br/>
You run with Accelerando, then Bellow the MOB... and keep accelerando up or <br/>
do you just run normally, and the MOB&#39;s a safe distance behind you <br/>
(although still within reach of Bellow) and it can only keep up with you <br/>
without gaining on you?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you do a combo of both all the time?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
S&#39;right,<br/>

And now for my nasty, tasteless, cheap story for all who have read this <br/>
far:<br/>
<br/>
I was on the island in Erud&#39;s Crossing earlier today. If you don&#39;t want to <br/>
know about it, read no further. Perhaps a *spoiler* below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

For those who don&#39;t know - it&#39;s a tiny island between Qeynos and Erudin <br/>
that&#39;s populated by some very sweet cat-people, vampire bats, Kerra Isle <br/>
beetles, Kerra Spiders, Wisps, Island Madmen, Earth Elementals and some <br/>
Zombies underwater by a sunken ship. (Very cool looking ship, I may add)<br/>
<br/>
Several times now I&#39;ve gotten into trouble there (kerra spiders help each <br/>
other out, and are pretty damn hardy) and have had to escape using <br/>
Accelerando. But where to go? It&#39;s a tiny island. So I have to run around <br/>
and around and around... and around... and as I go I pick up more spiders <br/>
along the way. I need to wait until the boat arrives, time it so that it&#39;s <br/>
almost about to leave before I speed onto the boat. Then the critters swim <br/>
up to the boat and whack me through the hull but with some luck the boat&#39;s <br/>
on its way before I get too hurt.<br/>
<br/>
People on the boat are often very perplexed about what&#39;s going on, but <br/>
while I&#39;m running and when the boat is in the zone I warn them all about <br/>
what&#39;s going to happen and ask them all to move to the front of the boat.<br/>
<br/>
So today I log on there, decide to go for zombies. Learn the hard way that <br/>
lull didn&#39;t do a good job on them and I start running and running, chased <br/>
by the three zombies and an elemental who decided to tag along for the <br/>
ride. All alone on the island, and the boat zones with one guy on it. I <br/>
start OOCing and Shouting, explaining what&#39;s going on... no answer.<br/>
<br/>
I repeat it... no answer. Again... the boat docks, I&#39;m running.. the guy&#39;s <br/>
on it, sitting in the middle of the deck. I yell again, I /tell him... <br/>
nothing. So what can I do? I speed up onto the boat, move away from him... <br/>
but POW POW POW! The zombies start whacking him. He leaps up, RUNS off the <br/>
boat and the boat starts to move.<br/>
<br/>
I stayed on the boat ;) A few seconds later he YELLS! &quot;HELP ON THE <br/>
DOCKK!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I zoned... nothing I could do for the poor bastard.<br/>
I stay on the boat, it goes to Erudin, then back to Erud&#39;s crossing <br/>
(although on the return journey it doesn&#39;t go near the island) and I see <br/>
(with the help of /who) that he&#39;s STILL in the zone! I was impressed, <br/>
assuming he&#39;d been whacked.<br/>
<br/>
1/2 an hour later I&#39;m in West Karana, on my way someplace else, waiting for <br/>
someone by T2... some people ther. 1 says, &quot;Where&#39;s &lt;&lt;that guy&gt;&gt;?&quot;<br/>
Other says &quot;Oh, he&#39;s getting his stuff, he died to 3 zombies&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh how I laughed.</div>
