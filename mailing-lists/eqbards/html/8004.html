<br/>
Green casters in a big group are the worst!  Give me some melee reds any<br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Divide and conquer - kill the 2 that sit at the base of hill.  Watch for the<br/>
ones that patrol and take them out.  Try to set up so that you can divide<br/>
the camp and attack the edges . Lull the lowest ones first and try to pull<br/>
the one likely to resist your lulls.   Try to pull so that they don&#39;t come<br/>
through other mobs agro ranges.  Like they said - casters tend to not pull<br/>
but sit back and cast - hit something that will melee and pull it a long way<br/>
out to make the caster run or stay out of the fight.  <br/>
<br/>
The plan: &quot;ok everyone charge!&quot; does not work - been there - done that. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest going to the other camp - the one near the river on the far east<br/>
and south side of the zone - just before the ghouls.  Lots less extra stuff<br/>
to deal with.  There are 2 that spawn closer to the river and do short<br/>
patrols. - Kill them first. Then you can approach the camp and look for a<br/>
good angle to attack so you can pull melee mobs out of the caster ranges.<br/>
You could try for a pull and have your party ready to bounce the casters<br/>
first as they chase you.  Like they said - drag the mobs around and have<br/>
your team pick them off one by one.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

		I recently played with a party of six in West Karana, and we<br/>
tried<br/>
		to kill some bandits in the bandit camp. I&#39;m interested in<br/>
input<br/>
		for how I can allow my more of party to survive a battle,<br/>
including<br/>
		myself.</div>
