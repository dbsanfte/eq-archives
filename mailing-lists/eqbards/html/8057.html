<div id="ygrps-yiv-658204886">The Z-Axis bug has to do with the z-axis being &quot;unlimited&quot; as it were.  It<br/>
is not the problem with thin walls or ceilings as in some dungeons, but<br/>
literally an infinite affect area within the z-axis.  <br/>
<br/>
So far as I can recall, this problem began as a result of a quick-fix Verant<br/>
patched in to prevent wizards from levitating , climbing a mountain and then<br/>
nuking giants and such from such a great height that the giant could not<br/>
fight back.  By implementing the unlimited z-axis, the giant is now able to<br/>
strike the wizard from the ground no matter how high in the air the wizard<br/>
is.  Nice, huh?<br/>
<br/>
This is also why combat in water areas is buggy, the z-axis of real space<br/>
does not exist for mobs underwater, meaning in essence the same scenario<br/>
exists as described above.<br/>

&gt; I wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a infinite<br/>
&gt; cylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For <br/>
&gt; example, the<br/>
&gt; infinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>
&gt; cylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter <br/>
&gt; how high), and<br/>
&gt; below you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would <br/>
&gt; be an equal<br/>
&gt; radius from you in all directions.  I have always been under <br/>
&gt; the impression<br/>
&gt; that the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also <br/>
&gt; always been<br/>
&gt; under the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>
&gt; separated from you by the ground/wall but still within the <br/>
&gt; radius of the<br/>
&gt; sphere were still affected.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone confirm this?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Heheh I can CONFIRM that it reaches all the way to the <br/>
&gt; ground from the top<br/>
&gt; &gt; floor of the birdhouse!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting <br/>
&gt; actively pulled -<br/>
&gt; &gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; no problems.  If not, you get attacked by invisible birds <br/>
&gt; (cuz they stand<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; ground and hit u)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; One half a but to 31 woo hoo!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>
&gt; &gt; SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended <br/>
&gt; along the z-axis.<br/>
