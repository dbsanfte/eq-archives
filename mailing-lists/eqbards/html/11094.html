<div id="ygrps-yiv-992365220">Overall the general population of twinkers could care less I am sure. <br/>
Hoever, I will never block a needy person (i.e., a druid needing a foreman <br/>
tunic) from the camp. Everything I have on my druid was not intentionally <br/>
camped by my high level for the purpose of twinking. It&#39;s all stuff I had <br/>
sitting in the bank, and hand me downs (like the Falchion). I am getting the <br/>
itch to camp for a mammoth cloak lately tho. =) Oh what a joy that will be..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   If a level 50 twinks because they<br/>
&gt;   are bored and they camped suchandsuch, then Verant needs to<br/>
&gt;   address that issue separately.  Lack of things to do at 35+<br/>
&gt;   is becoming very apparent, and overcrowding is forcing people<br/>
&gt;   to twink up lower level characters who can fight with ease<br/>
&gt;   in a uncrowded lower level zones.  There are plenty of druids<br/>
&gt;   out there who are L30 - L40 who still use a combine scimitar.<br/>
&gt;   And the fact that a L50 wizard will sit there and camp the<br/>
&gt;   foreman (because he&#39;s bored) to twink his L12 druid, thus<br/>
&gt;   blocking druids who need an obsidian scimitar for their<br/>
&gt;   primary still bothers me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t want this thread to blow up into some heated debate.<br/>
&gt;   Clearly there are two sides to this, and there will always be.<br/>
&gt;   My druid has L40 equipment, but not one piece have I sat and<br/>
&gt;   camped, I just ran across them and collected things.  My beef<br/>
&gt;   is with higher level characters actually camping X item or<br/>
&gt;   X quest because it will yield them profit or give them something<br/>
&gt;   to hand their L5 noob.  Rangers are extremely notorious for<br/>
&gt;   doing this, as they often track down rares and try to profit<br/>
&gt;   from the kill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   But last night after a server restart, who got to Bildge FarFathom<br/>
&gt;   first... hubba hubba hubba, who do you love?   Me?  I&#39;m giving<br/>
&gt;   away free reed belts.... And where oh where is the Ranger?  He&#39;s at<br/>
&gt;   home washing his tights!   bahaha... silly ranger tried to KS<br/>
&gt;   me too.  Three words: Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge.<br/>
