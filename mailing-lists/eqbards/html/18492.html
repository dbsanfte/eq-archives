<div id="ygrps-yiv-799972447">Wow what an awesome shield!  I just wanted one for the looks and was<br/>
actually hoping it sucked.  Thanks for the info Sylly, I like Shada, am<br/>
always on the lookout for stuff that makes me look Mahvelous.  That&#39;s my<br/>
main reason for hating my Dragoon Dirk, it so stupid looking!  Now that I<br/>
hear our Symphonic and Harmonic weapons look the same I&#39;m so bummed.  Our<br/>
guild now has two people over level 40 who offered to try to get me one for<br/>
all the help I gave them when they were lower level.  I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
heart to tell them to look for big ugly monsters that appeared to be<br/>
carrying rusty weapons.<br/>

I asked &quot;who&#39;s shield and which one&quot; and got:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tuur or Xaera -  Atremonious (spelling?) sheild, dropped off lord in CoM&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s also the Sarnek Battle shield which has the same picture. Dunk has<br/>
that. Almost the same stats too.&quot;<br/>

Looks like we got 3 of them. Wow, that second one bards can use!  Nice<br/>
stats!<br/>

&gt; Ask next time you see it for me please.  It was in the screenshot so I<br/>
&gt; thought it was one of your groupmates. ;-)<br/>
