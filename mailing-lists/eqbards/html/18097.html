<div id="ygrps-yiv-509811408">Well spent most of my time this weekend trying to get Charm fighting down with Griffawns and<br/>
Griffenes in NK. I have a couple of questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. I noticed (and assume) that killing Griffawns got the Griffenes to spawn. Are they like Cyclops<br/>
in the Rather Mtn&#39;s were you have to basically kill everything (bears, etc) to get more to spawn?<br/>
<br/>
2. What is a good level to start trying to charm cyclops in the Rathe Mtns? I tried on a yellow and<br/>
was unsuccessful about 10 times in a row.<br/>
<br/>
3. Froon and Choon in WK. Do I have a reasonable shot and charm fighting these 2 against each other?<br/>
<br/>
BTW my charisma is 123, but can be bumped up to 142.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
