<br/>
   I too wish Lambent was nodrop, I&#39;m tired of seeing level 10 bards<br/>
   running around in partial or (god forbid) full blue.  I never gave<br/>
   away crafted armor when it was the hot thing to make.  I always <br/>
   made said person at least pay my cost, and even then I wouldnt<br/>
   sell it to anyone below level 15.  There&#39;s no way a level 10<br/>
   should be carrying several hundred plat around to purchase this<br/>
   kind of armor anyway.<br/>
<br/>
   I may reward a bard I know with some Lambent, but they are mostly<br/>
   level 30+.  There really arent enough bards out there to drive<br/>
   the price of lambent up, so I would expect to pay the cost of<br/>
   jewels, maybe 25pp for the stone, and add 25-50 % markup for the<br/>
   effort to acquire nodrops.  These items arent worth much more than<br/>
   that.  And it&#39;s not like the guy is gonna say: Fine, I&#39;ll just<br/>
   find another bard who wants it.  Bard armor and items in general<br/>
   dont unload that easy.<br/>
<br/>
   I would assume Verant wanted you to start getting lambent armor<br/>
   around level 30 - 35.  Some places even a full group of level 35s<br/>
   cannot do.  At level 40, me and one level 40 druid got all the items<br/>
   we needed on our own, including the gypsy lute.<br/>
<br/>
   I feel your pain, lower level bards.  You get bronze now at such <br/>
   an early age and so cheap, after wearing it for 5 - 10 levels you<br/>
   desparately want an upgrade path and there is none.  Such is the<br/>
   price you pay for being given cheap mid level items.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
   there.  And there&#39;s nothing like earning your own stuff.<br/>
