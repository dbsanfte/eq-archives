<div id="ygrps-yiv-891005227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; make it fun for you.  Don&#39;t hate others because you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; think something is &quot;right&quot; about how they play the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to disagree with this because of a very strong point that can be<br/>
brought up. Some people enjoy using EQ&#39;s /ooc and /shout commands for their<br/>
constant chit-chat and arguing. They may find it fun and entertaining, but<br/>
the rest of the people on the server or in the zone couldn&#39;t care less and<br/>
would really prefer it if they&#39;d take it to IRC. (There&#39;s enough stuff to<br/>
keep track of in that little message window without trying to filter through<br/>
all the chatter) And before you say that we could simply turn off shouts or<br/>
ooc&#39;s - I&#39;d argue that you shouldn&#39;t be forced to do that just to enjoy the<br/>
game. There are some VERY good uses and quite a few times that the shout&#39;s<br/>
are used properly (ie: &quot;/shout Mino Hero at cave entrance!&quot;) that make the<br/>
tools valuable. I&#39;d also prefer to not have an ignore list a mile long.. I<br/>
do like interacting with people and helping them as much as possible. If<br/>
they were put on my ignore list a month ago and I go to help them and can&#39;t<br/>
see anything they&#39;re saying I&#39;m going to be slightly confused.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Remember - if it can be done, it will be done.<br/>
&gt; You may think Verant should put in some limits<br/>
&gt; on what level can have such and such stuffs.<br/>
&gt; But where is the fun in that? Much of the crazy<br/>
&gt; things that happen - happen because there are so<br/>
&gt; few rules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me ask you this.. If you worked hard at your job for awhile trying to<br/>
move up the ladder and then someone that had just started a few days ago got<br/>
a position (or the window desk you wanted, or better pay or whatever) higher<br/>
up than you just because their friend was influential with the upper-ups -<br/>
would it bother you? Of course it would. Sure, EQ is just a game - but you<br/>
spend &quot;real life&quot; time playing it and earning things. The person that got<br/>
offered the above perk maybe would be foolish to turn it down, but didn&#39;t<br/>
earn it - and may not do as good of a job without the type of experience<br/>
that you had gotten. (This is an example, and obviously isn&#39;t perfect - but<br/>
I&#39;m simply trying to make a little point)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not flaming or trying to start any arguments, I just thought a couple of<br/>
examples might help you see why some of us disagree. There&#39;s probably no<br/>
clear line as to what&#39;s right and when..</div>
