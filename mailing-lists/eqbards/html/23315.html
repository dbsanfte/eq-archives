&gt; I have my #4 button set up to throw my main heal, and #0 set up with the<br/>

&gt; Hehe...  :)  Stand, heal, sit.  Stand, heal, sit.  Had an awesome group.<br/>

Heal, Med...<br/>
<br/>
I became involved (IE got a part in) a play and my rehersal schedule<br/>
conflicted with my regular EQ group.  Fortunatly (at the time) I lived with<br/>
your group&#39;s warrior, and he was able to run both pc&#39;s and play both<br/>
characters without much of a hiccup (granted they picked easy places to camp<br/>
like Dalnir&#39;s while he was doing this).<br/>
<br/>
Heres what my cleric hot key bank looks like:<br/>
1. Valor (replace with random spell like counteract poison if situation<br/>
calls for it)<br/>
2. Sup Heal<br/>
3. Greater Heal<br/>
4. Root<br/>
5. Stun<br/>
6. Holy Might (another stun spell) (If they aren&#39;t any caster mobs I care<br/>
about, Wrath (dd spell) goes here)<br/>
7. Buff spell (rotates between ac/symbol/resists)<br/>
8. Divine Aura (30 sec invul spell, recast time is 15 min, so its always<br/>
memmed)<br/>
<br/>
It never changes.  I have had all these spells (or their lower level<br/>
version) since level 4 I think.  It will never change (except name changes<br/>
when I get an upgrade).<br/>
<br/>
Most fights, I never see the mobs (well now I will since I finally lost my<br/>
spell book while medding).<br/>
<br/>
I;m not complaining, in many ways I like my cleric. Its easy, its relaxing,<br/>
I watch Smackdown while I am playing (Flame away with &quot;Then you aren&#39;t<br/>
playing your cleric right&quot;  I&#39;ve heard it before...My group has a run of 5<br/>
straight weeks of 0 deaths.  This has been done 100% inside dungeons, 75%<br/>
with no enchancter, 100% with my insane former roomate pulling, who&#39;s quoted<br/>
as saying &quot;I was bored so I decided to pull 3 casters&quot;, and we have gotten<br/>
at least a (non hell) level every 5-6 hour session, with non twinked<br/>
characters.  We are effective)  I&#39;m just saying, I gave up alot when I chose<br/>
cleric.</div>
