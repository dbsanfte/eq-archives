<b>Subject:</b> mip = many innapropriate pictures? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747184358">Hi,<br/>
sorry this is off topic and I would happily accept as an answer a pointer to<br/>
where it is on topic...but my 2D card died and I leapt at the opportunity to<br/>
migrate to a voodoo3 2000. Well, I was guessing at all the correct settings,<br/>
but mip mapping seemed like a good idea, until I selected it and restarted.<br/>
At that point none of the textures were ones the designers intended and as<br/>
entertaining as it was to see an female Ogres face scroll across the sky I<br/>
am not sure I care for it as a steady diet. I settled on turning it off and<br/>
using &quot;Force mip mapping&quot; on the 3dfx control panel, which returned the<br/>
world to &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>
In short, is there a set of canonical settings for EQ and a Voodoo3 2000?<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
Tszaaz, still on a PII 233 and 56K as well.</div>
