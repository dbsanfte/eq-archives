<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990860764"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That&#39;s what the extra duration is for, to<br/>
&gt; balance out the lost damage during the pull<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they want to &quot;balance&quot; it, in my opinion<br/>
(others will vary), I would think that the<br/>
initial damage done would be increased to<br/>
make up for the lost amount in the beginning<br/>
of the battle. I&#39;m not asking for something<br/>
silly like doubling it, just make up for <br/>
the loss.<br/>
<br/>
I personally still don&#39;t see kiting as a<br/>
major problem. Someone pointed out that<br/>
some people create really bad trains while<br/>
kiting.. Fixing kiting isn&#39;t going to fix<br/>
this. On Veeshan, people train Spectre&#39;s for<br/>
fun just to see how many people die. And<br/>
then they shout &quot;how many lamers died that<br/>
time? hahaha&quot;. Of course, GM&#39;s on Veeshan<br/>
are non-existant so what the heck?</div>
