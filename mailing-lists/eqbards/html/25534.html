<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm - methinks we hang out with the same people ;)  Marshall and I go way <br/>
back.  I used to camp behind the shop next door (last year it was the <br/>
&quot;Crystal Tree&quot;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for the horn, yeah, grab a horn from the shop (you can also get one<br/>
&gt;from Krak in south karana, using the faction song, if you don&#39;t wanna<br/>
&gt;run all the way back to town.  You&#39;ll be dubious to him, so run up, play<br/>
&gt;your faction song w/ wind, and you can use him as a merchant, or, sneak<br/>
&gt;behind him, and he&#39;ll trade, as well.  If you can, get one of the<br/>
&gt;shell&#39;s out of Siren&#39;s Grotto...you seem to have some way of getting<br/>
&gt;high level stuff...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lute of the Howler is a dream for me...I really don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever<br/>
&gt;see one, much less own one...I&#39;m still stuck w/ Mistmoore Drums, because<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t seem to get a group together to go get dalnir/kaesora/ot coins<br/>
&gt;*shrug*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;d really like to get a Drums of the Beast, and see if the speed cap<br/>
&gt;is hit at 43...but...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I lucked into a very very very very rare drop due to a loot-table <br/>
screw up, and traded it to a guild for &quot;my choice&quot; - I chose the Lute and <br/>
all the coins for Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine.  That was sheer luck.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that the shells are not that hard to get - but I didn&#39;t <br/>
realize they were brass.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice - hope to see you Saturday!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ok, so which shop?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m gonna be there this weekend for the afr (alt.fairs.renaissance)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;invasion.  I&#39;ll prolly be in the kilt, if you look at the pic&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to actually meet a fellow bard :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I work for the Crowning Glory, next to the Battlemound.  I&#39;m the only<br/>
&gt;guy<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  Try not to drool on the girls ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And Evulia,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;No, I didn&#39;t win the contest...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;E.J., the shaman got 1st place, and the Troll got 2nd.  They get<br/>
&gt;custom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;art of their characters done for winning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I saw that shaman all day, and kept thinking, &quot;Damn, he looks<br/>
&gt;familiar&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t realize it was the costume, though *chuckles*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Talies, I was in EK as a bard at 16...if you go down by the shore,<br/>
&gt;past<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the bridge from runnyeye, (around -1000 to -2000) you can pull single<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;gnolls and kite them up and down the shore...but if you get any adds,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;head for the bridge and zone...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;At 18, I learned the 2 instrument/3 song twist here, fighting 2-4<br/>
&gt;gnolls<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;at a time.  It&#39;s easy xp then...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully easier with my beautiful Lute of the Howler...  I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get a horn before I get that song, though, huh?<br/>
