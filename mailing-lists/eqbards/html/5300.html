<b>Subject:</b> Qeynos Instrument Making Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046463768">Just for a note on the Qeynos quests involving making a flute and a horn.<br/>
Those are VERY old quests and they worked long ago. I believe they were<br/>
taken out because they were too profitable. If you talk to the guy who makes<br/>
them now he says he is no longer in the business of making instruments. My<br/>
guess is they left parts of it in cause they plan on putting it back later<br/>
or did not want to disturb the code too much. I did this quest way back in<br/>
phase 3 and phase 4.<br/>
