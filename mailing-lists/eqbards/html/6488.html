<b>Subject:</b> Test Results of Some Songs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785790039">Here are the results of my test last night:<br/>
<br/>
Lv 40 song is a target dispel song.  It takes out one buff per tick.  The <br/>
debuff order seems to be from the most recently casted buff to the oldest <br/>
one.  It removed my lv 49 wizard&#39;s damage shield, skin, and hp buff in 3 <br/>
ticks.  It couldn&#39;t remove his ultravision however.  No text message, you <br/>
just see a purple lightball on target like the graphic effect of chain song. <br/>
  It was never resisted the many times I tried it.<br/>
<br/>
Chain song is fixed!  No more spending 10 min chasing down a green SoWed <br/>
shaman!<br/>
<br/>
Chain song on self will still break snare when the song effect is over.<br/>
<br/>
Chain song on self will still break root, and when the song effect is over, <br/>
you move at normal rate.<br/>
<br/>
The new DoT change applies to our songs as well.  I tested the lv 48 CoC <br/>
song on 4 darkweed snakes.  For two of them, I stand still and play the song <br/>
for one hit.  Each time the snake would lose about 3/4 of its health after 3 <br/>
ticks.  The other 2 snakes, I play the song once and start to run away from <br/>
it.  Each of those snake only lost about 1/2 hp after 3 ticks.  So that is <br/>
33% decrease in damage as announced by Verant when the MOB is chasing <br/>
someone.<br/>
<br/>
Our Pixie Strike song is faster than any Lv49 wizard DD spell.  I can <br/>
interrupted my friend almost everytime.  When hit, wizard spell damage never <br/>
hit me for max damage.  Probably becuase of the patch.<br/>
<br/>
Our songs has also been reduced in damage in PvP. Lv 48 song CoC (with lute) <br/>
only hit for about 100 damage in PvP.  Before the patch, it hit for 150 <br/>
damage in PvP.<br/>
<br/>
Lv 48 CoC and Lv 2 CoD stacks.  With a lute, at level 48, they did over 200 <br/>
AE damage in 3 ticks.</div>
