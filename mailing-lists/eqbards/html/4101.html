<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606870099">While this is not really barding related - I guess anything that touches<br/>
the virtual world to this extent affects bards as much as anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Now - excuse me while I try to understand these statements.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s understood that twinking is irritating to everyone but the twinkie -<br/>
however that said.....<br/>

At 09:38 PM 7/21/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>

&gt;I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>
&gt;because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>
&gt;behinds off for what we have,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PLEASE explain to me how (unless you are +pvp) what they have has ANY<br/>
bearing on you whatsoever? The &#39;it&#39;s not fair&#39; portion fairly reeks of &quot;I<br/>
didn&#39;t, you can&#39;t&quot;. Right or wrong, this in no way equates to &#39;fair or<br/>
unfair&#39; since this is not a competition. Last I checked - no one got a<br/>
cookie for being first to anything here. My neighbor has a caddie - I drive<br/>
a bug - it&#39;s &#39;not fair&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s so nice to know that the happiness monitor is paying attention<br/>
and on duty. Really - if THEY are missing out - uhhhhh - is this also any<br/>
of your or my concern? While I happen to believe in your statement myself,<br/>
that is a personal choice - and there is nothing any of us - or Verant for<br/>
that matter can substantially do to stop this short of totally<br/>
restructuring the way things work. Thankfully - unless you are +pvp - it<br/>
removes a huge part of the equation of &#39;affecting others&#39; unfairly or<br/>
adversely.<br/>
<br/>
I felt great when I was able to afford <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>
&gt;until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>
&gt;(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate <br/>
&gt;would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I <br/>
&gt;play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them - <br/>
&gt;sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the <br/>
&gt;most out of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - my story is much the same, most of my contemporaries have moved onto<br/>
bronze, I&#39;m still in banded, and likely will be till rubicite, if I ever<br/>
decide to move on at all. I am under no compunction to ever advance past<br/>
where I am now - some of us are NOT explorer - adventurer types. I&#39;m happy<br/>
that everything in my homeland doesn&#39;t want a piece of me on a stick at<br/>
this point - that was my sole level goal. I look at this more as a world to<br/>
live in - vs a hack and slash to hit 50 on and finish. Matter of fact - I<br/>
spend a LOT of time in town, I just wish &#39;clothing&#39; didn&#39;t look like a<br/>
skimpy one-piece bathing suit on me. I did make it to Qeynos today to get a<br/>
silk evening whachmacalit - the one with +5 charisma - guess what, looks<br/>
like I&#39;m back in my swimsuit top *sigh*. Npc&#39;s can have nice clothes, why<br/>
can&#39;t I?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that depends - is this their first character? Believe me - after<br/>
playing UO for 2+ years, and EQ now for a few months, newbieness looses<br/>
it&#39;s attraction after you&#39;ve already been there done that. Even if THIS<br/>
character hasn&#39;t - YOU have. Working up thru the lower ranks becomes so<br/>
much repetitive work - and it&#39;s a lot the same for most classes -<br/>
newbieness is newbieness all over Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Would I give one of my new characters equipment my old had outgrown, hmmm -<br/>
depends what it is. Probably, if it&#39;s nothing outlandish. My husband has a<br/>
habit of &#39;playing&#39; around with a lot of different classes - although I tell<br/>
him when he gets frustrated to wait a bit, all classes are much the same to<br/>
start (i.e., you die a lot) he still does it. I will usually give him a<br/>
suit of patchwork and a real weapon - ewwww....bigtime twink there.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I ever got my hands on the REALLY nice stuff - I&#39;d still pass it<br/>
down, but I&#39;d wait till that character was approaching appropriate level<br/>
for it. Not even for any high moral ground, but because all the twinking in<br/>
the world isn&#39;t gonna keep a lvl 1 from dieing with GREAT regularity. These<br/>
folks that do it before Lvl 5 are really much braver than I. I can see it<br/>
now, <br/>
<br/>
a) Make Newbie<br/>
b) Give Newbie 5 packpacks of armor and weapons<br/>
c) Equip Newbie<br/>
d) Newbie gets his butt handed to him by first bat he sees<br/>

WHAT!  Quick, redial, redial - what someone cut an OC LINE! ARRRRRGGGGGHHH!<br/>
WHAT DO YOU MEAN VEESHAN IS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br/>
<br/>
Scratch one very expensive set of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen enough of these deaths to know that no armor or weapon in the<br/>
game is gonna make up for experience points - YOU IS STILL GONNA DIE - that<br/>
is one thing Verant did very, very well - twinking may be visual, but it<br/>
does NOT makeup for experience points - or knowledge of how things work.</div>
