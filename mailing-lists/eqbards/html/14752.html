<div id="ygrps-yiv-530977008">I am pretty sure that I got mine in the &quot;bar room&quot; in Sol-A.  We were there<br/>
about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s rangers with us<br/>
lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at levels 24 thru<br/>
28 group, we got spanked.  If you can recruit some mid 30&#39;s types you should<br/>
do pretty well.<br/>

&gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
&gt; spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-) </span></blockquote></div>
