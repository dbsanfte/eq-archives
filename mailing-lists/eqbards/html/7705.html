you leave yourself bound in a city and make the easiest way of getting<br/>
back to your corpse a cleric res?  That would be silly, especially since<br/>
you pointed out that corpse retrieval is much more of the issue.  If you<br/>
were in a group, and they need you to help out with retrieval, why would<br/>
it be in your best interest to waste 30 minutes of the group&#39;s time and<br/>
600 mana for the druid to go over their, pick you up to the nearest gate,<br/>
and wait as you run the rest of the way back.<br/>
	No one is saying there aren&#39;t other options other than running<br/>
from freeport to lower guk at the later levels.  However, if you have the<br/>
option of binding yourself right outside the dungeon, you&#39;d be silly not<br/>
to do it.  After all, you can&#39;t gate, so the bind is only really useful if<br/>
you die.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; With my druid I don&#39;t bind close to where I&#39;m fighting either. Usually<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a druid gate within 2 or 3 zones of where I am, and I&#39;m used to<br/>
&gt; running that far as a bard anyway so it&#39;s no big deal. Currently my<br/>
&gt; druid is bound in quenos and fighting on Faydwer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Druids and wizards are the only exceptions I can think of to this,<br/>
because they are pretty much self sufficient in getting back to the<br/>
dungeons they&#39;re fighting in.  But more often than not, they are bound to<br/>
places they can&#39;t be easily with their teleports (right outside Permafrost<br/>
and the Molten Cloak room in Sol A come to mind).  One is so they can<br/>
access the zone that is furtherest from a teleport point, the other is<br/>
deep in a dungeon so they don&#39;t have to fight all the way down to check on<br/>
a single spawn.<br/>
	As a druid, being bound in butcher is no different than being<br/>
bound right outside a dungeon.  Since that&#39;s true, why not make it easier<br/>
for your party.<br/>
