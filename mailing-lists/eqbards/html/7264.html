<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961904641">The dark elf was stupid.  Smiting you was a total waste of his mana unless<br/>
his smites alone could kill you which he should have known they could not.<br/>
Try that against a dwarf cleric who knows waht he&#39;s doing and you will die.<br/>
especially now that he can root you and you can&#39;t interrupt his healing when<br/>
he backs away.  <br/>
<br/>
My problem is the dwarf cleric in our group, same level as me, has 20% more<br/>
hit points than I do and a better AC.  He has stamina and strength over 100<br/>
and an agility and dex of 90 something or near to it.  He can mop the floor<br/>
with me in melee despite my having 18 pts more weapon skill than him.  If he<br/>
heals himself it would be even more of a joke.  The last time we dueled he<br/>
was the one left with two bubbles while I was near death.  Thank goodness<br/>
he&#39;s on my side is all I have to say!  If he was a dwarf Paladin it would be<br/>
even more laughable, I doubt he would drop below 3 bubbles.  His dwarf<br/>
paladin that is 5 levels below me has more hp than I do.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main problem is that while Verant originally intended a high<br/>
agility to compensate for low hit points that the lower stamina gives you,<br/>
they got burned by someone with super-agility being unhittable and reduced<br/>
the agility benefit.  My sole saving grace is I get hit less often than he<br/>
does even with a worse AC because I dodge more, even though our dodge skill<br/>
is only 5 points different.  Now if they gave wood elves a defense bonus to<br/>
compensate for the low hit points maybe it would even out, but right now I<br/>
can&#39;t do enough more damage, even with dual wield, to account for his<br/>
greater hit points.<br/>

<br/>
in the right context here.<br/>
<br/>
Cleric vs Bard melee should DEFINITELY be a NON-Issue (especially after 17th<br/>
<br/>
level). Beside the fact that Clerics skill is inherently (sp?) low, <br/>
something like 3 or 4 points per level toward blunt skills, which is <br/>
comparable to a caster, I have personally meleed a cleric in a duel and <br/>
found it laughable.<br/>
<br/>
I walked up to Nektulos zone in E Commons to find a Dark Elf Cleric <br/>
harrassing a friend of mine. He was 20th level as was I, my friend was 16th <br/>
level. He kept challenging her to a duel, but she wouldn&#39;t accept so I <br/>
dueled him for her. He smited me down to 2 bubbles of hp before he was oom, <br/>
after which i proceeded to rape him in melee (he was full health at the time<br/>
<br/>
he went oom). He zoned out almost dead; I still had 2 bubbles hp. I was not <br/>
twinked either.<br/>
