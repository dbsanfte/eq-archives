<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651427245"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Essentially, DoT spells do not damage the<br/>
&gt; NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My question is if I&#39;m casting a DoT on a mob<br/>
that&#39;s fairly far away (to pull) and he&#39;s<br/>
running towards me and &quot;has a velocity&quot; the<br/>
DoT isn&#39;t going to do damage for the time<br/>
he&#39;s running? Granted, we&#39;re not talking about<br/>
a lot of damage here, but I&#39;ve been in battles<br/>
that were evenly matched hp to hp where I&#39;ve<br/>
won with only a few hitpoints (&lt;10) left. Those<br/>
initial 5-10+ points that would have been<br/>
done could make / break the fight. (Please don&#39;t<br/>
tell me I should have ran. Many times I&#39;ve had<br/>
an NPC down to their last bubble when they<br/>
turned into Rocky friggin Balboa on me and<br/>
whipped my butt.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that&#39;s not the intent, but how do<br/>
you distinguish between a monster running after<br/>
a moving target and a monster running towards<br/>
a non-moving target? What if the mob is running<br/>
towards me and I happen to move a couple steps<br/>
for whatever reason? Do I all of the sudden<br/>
become a kiter in the games eyes and no damage<br/>
is done?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as a RP reason for them to fail, how<br/>
&gt; &#39;bout when you turn to run, you lose control<br/>
&gt; of the spell and it fails?  (too busy<br/>
&gt; concentratiing on getting away)<br/>

is for.<br/>

Maybe some of you could tell me since I don&#39;t<br/>
kite, and I rarely see anyone kiting on the<br/>
server (Veeshan) that I play on.. How big of<br/>
a problem is kiting anyway? When&#39;s the last<br/>
time you saw someone kiting Lady Vox or trying<br/>
to kite inside a dungeon?</div>
