 </span></blockquote>Hmm, are you sure on that last bit?  I used to be amiable with<br/>
the merchants there.  Then I camped in Cazic and got hit by<br/>
that bug that reset some of my factions and I was back to<br/>
dubious with them, but they&#39;d still sell to me.  I was grouped<br/>
with a friend who was KOS to Trumpy, and we ran into this bug.  <br/>
Trumpy and a friend came charging up the dock and my friends<br/>
casually killed them both.  Since I was playing Clarity at the<br/>
time, I took the faction hits.  The merchants wouldn&#39;t sell to<br/>
me after that.<br/>
