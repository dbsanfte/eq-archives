<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034022777">I got through 30 in 1.5 evenings of play in Cazic-Thule.  Couldn&#39;t even tell<br/>
it was a Hell Level.  Went through 35 in CT as well, although it was<br/>
noticably slower it wasn&#39;t bad either.  Just do the Temple Top Archon or<br/>
Upper Throne Room.  Kill, kill, kill.<br/>
