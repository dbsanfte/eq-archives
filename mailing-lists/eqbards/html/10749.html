<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436229445"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Err, with all due respect, I&#39;ve killed at least 3 dozen hill giants <br/>
&gt; with charm at level 30 so far.  It works just fine.  That&#39;s not to say<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t died a lot (and I mean a LOT) getting good at it.  But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; halfway through level 30 on giant exp alone, and have made around <br/>
&gt; 1500pp from doing it.  Just don&#39;t tell anyone!  Lest nerftdom come!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No doubt it can be done, but even when I did it at level 35, I got<br/>
  enough resists to make it a big hassle.  Plus lag deaths are the<br/>
  worst...  I think the part that caught my eye, was the person said<br/>
  he was pulling it off flawlessly with very little resists / effort.<br/>
<br/>
  You are definitely smarter than I was at level 30, =)<br/>
<br/>
  Now if I could only go back in time &lt;g&gt;<br/>
