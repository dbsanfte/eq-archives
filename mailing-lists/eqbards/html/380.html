<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010708100">I think my HtH skill is up around the high 20&#39;s now and my max damage is 5<br/>
with a strength of 80. I think that grouping is about the only way to<br/>
practice it. Going solo would prolly get you spanked by anything that would<br/>
actually raise your skill since it would take a while longer to kill it and<br/>
healing will only be doing 2 add&#39;l points with the lute.<br/>
<br/>
	Well... It might be practicable with dual wield. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still 2<br/>
and 1/2 bars away from that little gem.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

There are many times, I simply hate to abandon my instrument and<br/>
equip my heavy weapon. I would love to continue pounding my drum and<br/>
punch my enemy in synchrony with the beat of my tune. However so far,<br/>
my delicate hands yield very little damage, unless holding a weapon.<br/>
I was wondering if any fellow bard has an excellent hand to hand<br/>
skill. Is it worth practicing? What is the most damage that can be<br/>
inflicted with ones bare bard hands?<br/>
