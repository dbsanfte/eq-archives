<b>Subject:</b> A bard and making money... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-505433395">As you&#39;ve spent time with your bard, no doubt you&#39;ve noticed you have a<br/>
distinct advantage over other citizens in that you can buy and sell much<br/>
more efficiently. Naturally, as the item price increases, so does the amount<br/>
of the advantage you get. Add to this the fact that bards can travel more<br/>
efficiently than most, and you&#39;ve got the mixings for a natural merchant<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some tactics you might consider in order to take full advantage of<br/>
your charming nature.<br/>
<br/>
1) Make friends with high level players - maybe you do a free corpse<br/>
retrieval, maybe you sit around and heal a party for free. But the goal is<br/>
to get them to trust you. Why? Because you&#39;re going to buy their platemail<br/>
and combine weapons for them. If you can get them to trust you with 500+<br/>
plat, you can make a very nice profit off of buying high level equipment at<br/>
a rate much lower than what they can get.<br/>
<br/>
If you can build up enough money to just start this process, you can<br/>
circumvent the &quot;trust&quot; issue by just selling equipment for a few plat over<br/>
what you bought it for.<br/>
<br/>
2) Accept &quot;payment&quot; from other citizens in the form of retail items.<br/>
Basically, you want to &quot;trade&quot; rather than &quot;sell&quot; to them. This requires<br/>
careful charting of the cost of goods, and a willingness to be sure you have<br/>
good rapport with merchants.<br/>
FICTITIOUS SCENARIO:<br/>
You buy a GooberSword for 5 plat. A Dwarf rogue wants it, and he would have<br/>
to pay 7 plat for it. Instead of buying it from you, you ask him to trade<br/>
stuff he&#39;s already carrying. Let&#39;s say, a CheesyLightstone that the Dwarf<br/>
could sell for 3 plat, but that you could sell for 5 plat. So he gives you 2<br/>
of these - now the cost to the Dwarf is 6plat, in essence, but now you turn<br/>
around and sell the CheesyLightstones for 10 plat. Instead of making 1 plat<br/>
profit, you just made 5 plat profit.<br/>
<br/>
3) Travel, travel, travel. You can run like the wind. Do it! Here&#39;s an<br/>
example of something I did. I went to Guk (near Grobb, amidst some<br/>
trepidation) and bought all the woven and netted stuff I could afford.<br/>
Trolls and the like will sell for 1-3 plat each piece since it&#39;s fairly easy<br/>
to find, and many of them don&#39;t want to travel to the karanas or Freeport to<br/>
make the sale, they&#39;d rather stay there and get xp and loot.<br/>
<br/>
Now travel to Felwithe, and sell the stuff to desperate mages, who can<br/>
hardly even hold up their own sword. Neriak is also a fine place to sell.<br/>
The real profit can be made in Qeynos - particularly with woven/netted<br/>
gloves. They give monks the ability to do magical damage. I have seen woven<br/>
gloves going for as high as 6pp and usually at 3-4pp. Monks love this armour<br/>
because they get large AC bonuses for staying under a certain weight). Plus,<br/>
Monks don&#39;t travel extremely well. Mage-types have Gate, Bards/shamans can<br/>
run, and going through Oasis or Rathe isn&#39;t a risk-free venture.<br/>
<br/>
I hope these tactics can help you become a successful merchant. An editorial<br/>
on my part: Don&#39;t be intimidated by people who call you greedy. A merchant&#39;s<br/>
life is to make money through trade. On the other hand, you should learn the<br/>
going prices, because if you want to develop a reputation as a merchant, you<br/>
want repeat business. If you become well known, they may pay you to go buy<br/>
combine weapons, spells, gems, or other far away items.<br/>
<br/>
greatest of speed to you,<br/>
