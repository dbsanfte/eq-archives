-- imagine, wasting time on &quot;fixing&quot; this, while<br/>
there are things like ~deadly~ pathing bugs to worry about.--<br/>
&lt;end snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would think that an animation is an art bug whereas a pathing bug is quite<br/>
likely to fall to a programmer, which given the fact that the expansion is<br/>
due out in a while they probably doesn&#39;t have a lot of time(like we ever do)<br/>
<br/>
Although why an artist would be told to fix this instead of creating some<br/>
new graphics for some of the armour we&#39;ll never know, probably a trainee<br/>
artist given the why the animation looks :) <br/>
Hopefully they get it right next time ^,^<br/>
