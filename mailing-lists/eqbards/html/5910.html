<b>Subject:</b> LORE items - A light at the end of the tunnel. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-37512398">This thread my be BONKED but I think it&#39;s pertinent to all players, especially<br/>
bards who drop things through the cracks fairly regularly.<br/>
<br/>
As you may have read over the past couple of days, my cute little female<br/>
half-elf bard on Fennin Ro dropped a 700pp pair of Bladed Thulian Claws in a<br/>
bag during a trade.  They were destroyed before I ever even got to try them<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
I sent email to the customer service manager at Verant.  I won&#39;t waste the<br/>
space reproducing it here unless requested to, but I attempted to make it<br/>
intelligent and constructive but I did color it with my anger and aggrevation<br/>
at the loss when it occurred.  I asked what the appropriate venue was to air<br/>
my complaint (i.e. who to send further email to) about this loss for possible<br/>
restoration, and stated that I agreed with the logic behind LORE.  I then<br/>
asked what the logic was of having LORE items destroyed when dropped.<br/>
<br/>
This was his reply to me:<br/>

Dear Jason,<br/>
<br/>
I assume you purchased a ONE claw? They are lore items so it would be<br/>
impossible to possess two. I will direct the server GM to return you one<br/>
claw. In the near future we are changing the code to not destroy lore items<br/>
when they are dropped. You will see that information on the patch server<br/>
message when it is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for your distress and inconvenience!<br/>
<br/>

Can you say HOT DAMN!  It would appear that I&#39;m going to get my Claw restored<br/>
to me.  I got this email this morning, so it&#39;s unlikely that the Claw is<br/>
actually restored to me yet but I&#39;ll be checking first thing when I get home<br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I replied to him briefly saying basically &#39;Many will be relieved when LORE<br/>
items are not destroyed when dropped.&#39;, and thanking him for his unexpected<br/>
restoration.<br/>
