<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637395565">I like the idea of CT DT.  I played a mud where a god on there could<br/>
not only just kill people like this, but could decide that he would cast<br/>
an AE spell continuously until everything was dead.  Yes, upsetting<br/>
when we first experienced it, but oh that was soo much fun<br/>
when we do win.<br/>
<br/>
Theory 1:<br/>
Power is limited, even for gods.  Not even gods have unlimitd<br/>
charges of anything they want. <br/>
<br/>
Theory 2:<br/>
Power is unlimited, but gods must abide by some fair fight rules<br/>
set down before time was time.<br/>
<br/>
Theory 3:<br/>
Make up your own reasoning so that it pleases you, don&#39;t use mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>
&gt; would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>
&gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>
&gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>
&gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>
&gt; super-powers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You were doing so well... then this paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Why have denizens if anytime anything comes you insta-kill?  let<br/>
your pets have some fun.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Yes.  Stop giving these gods all sorts of god-like powers!  What<br/>
are you thinking? *grin*<br/>
