<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117970000"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Last night I did a little experimenting with the level 11 song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Changes have definately occurred.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is what I have noticed:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Singing the song at an NPC who is less than &quot;amiable&quot; to you will<br/>
&gt; make them<br/>
&gt; look upon you amiably.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Singing the song at an NPC who &quot;scowls at you ready to attack&quot;<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; do anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried it on a Nektulos Guard (Dark Elf lands) and changed him from<br/>
&quot;scowls and ready to attack&quot; to &quot;looks at me threateningly&quot;... he<br/>
still chased me out of their forest as I got a bit too close while<br/>
trying to charm him :)<br/>
