<br/>
I would say level 22 and 23 were two of the longest levels that I had to<br/>
get out of.  I was in level 22 for about 2 weeks and the same for 23.<br/>
What you need to do is to get into a good group in Unrest that is camping<br/>
the barroom or the Hand room.  The xp is great and the spawn is pretty<br/>
frequent.  And you will find that the group will love you to death.  The<br/>
last few days that I spent in there have enlightened a lot of people to<br/>
the value of a bard in a party.  Many times I either replaced a departing<br/>
warrior or caster and the group has exclaimed after the continuous battles<br/>
that this is the best group that they have been in.  Hehe it&#39;s good to see<br/>
people learn the powers of a bard =).  So persevere, you&#39;ll need some good<br/>
groups to get you out of level 22, 23 is bit easier.  Getting past 24<br/>
seemed easy for me, since a majority of the MOBs in the 2nd floor con even<br/>
and below.  BTW my bad luck came without prepurchasing a song.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have been &quot;stuck&quot; in level 22 for a good long week now.  I think I<br/>
&gt; have found the cause.  Last time I was at the library in HighKeep, I bought<br/>
&gt; my 23rd level song.  Does anyone else thing buying songs ahead of time is<br/>
&gt; bad luck???<br/>
