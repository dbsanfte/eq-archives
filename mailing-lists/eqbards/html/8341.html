<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172152008">Ok, this has got me really excited.  I am not sure how the Guise of the<br/>
Deciever works.  Could someone post about the Guise?  A Dark elf Bard.. wow<br/>
that is really tasty.  I am mainly wondering if the illusion accuratly<br/>
represents your current armor?  Any info would be appreciated.  I would<br/>
really like to freak people out by singing songs and wearing that cool skull<br/>
helmet that the Dark Elves get to wear.<br/>

 Bring a Necro along and your set. You could do this with a cleric but since<br/>
they don&#39;t have invis it&#39;s a bit tougher. Basically go to the tower entrance<br/>
in Lower Guk and you will be with in range to get their with invis undead.<br/>
You&#39;ll have to look at some sites for maps though try eq&#39;cleric.<br/>

&gt;Thats a good idea.  I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or my cash,<br/>
&gt;someone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though is not getting<br/>
&gt;killed while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24 bard can pull<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Step number one, if you get down there and a group is camping the mob<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>

&gt;&gt; (Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would mind if you<br/>
&gt;&gt; looted it.  Be creative,<br/>
&gt;&gt; offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway and just want<br/>
&gt;&gt; to pull Serrated Bone<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you entertain them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If they&#39;re jerks about it, then offer to pay.  If it was my group though,<br/>
&gt;&gt; we&#39;d happily let you<br/>
&gt;&gt; loot it for free.<br/>
