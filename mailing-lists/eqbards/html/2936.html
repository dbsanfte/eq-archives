&gt; Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>
&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>
&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>
&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>
&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>
&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>
&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>
&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well so far I have been able to twist three songs together without too<br/>
much difficulty, though I usually lose the buff for a split second.  This<br/>
is with a Celeron 450 128MB Ram and a Voodoo2 8MB.  Not exactly the<br/>
greatest setup.  Though I cannot be one hundred percent sure at times<br/>
because my cable modem connection is really bad.  I usually get spikes of<br/>
70%-80% packet loss at times. Last night I was able to do it in Guk while<br/>
adventuring with 2 wizards and a Druid and everything seemed responsive<br/>
enough for me to twist the standard bello, bellow, anthem combo.<br/>
