<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185893547">Agreed - the funniest thing about the haste issue - is most are convinced<br/>
they stacked at one time (When did they nerf this?)  I usually tell them<br/>
(probably correctly - but if not at least they save face) that they are<br/>
mixed up with the fact bard haste stacks with haste items -not other classes<br/>
haste spells.  Some still insist its true - even to the point of - when I<br/>
sing it to show them they say &quot;See I&#39;m faster now&quot;...  (The funniest<br/>
incident - I was arguing a tank about this - and he shouts to zone &quot;Does<br/>
Bard Haste stack with Shaman?&quot; and then some Uber 60 Tank from some Uber<br/>
Guild says no - and this guy acted like it was the word of God...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I agree tone has a lot to do with it.  I have no problems at all<br/>
with people ASKING me to play certain songs (particularly when I first join<br/>
the group and am setting up - not in the middle of combat).  Even in the<br/>
case when they ask for a haste song when a Shaman is singing haste<br/>
(mistakenly believing it stacks) - if they ask me nice enough - fine.<br/>
<br/>
What annoys me the most is people who say &quot;Just sing Mana&quot;.  Anyone who has<br/>
done the research (ie read the testing on eqsongs.com or tested<br/>
themselves) - knows that barring missed notes - the mana recovery of &quot;just<br/>
singing mana&quot; and twisting one other song is identical.  You might as well<br/>
tell tanks to toggle of attack every other tick...<br/>

Not exclusive, but bards definitly suffer from this the most.  I have no<br/>
idea why all thse people assume they know how to play my 51 bard better than<br/>
I do.  I guess they all play lvl 60 bards as their primaries.  I still run<br/>
into to people that insist my normal haste songs (not the Ervaj ones) stack<br/>
haste effects with enchanters.  &quot;DEWD!!! I tested it MYSELF!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I am in a group where I am lacking any realy good songs to play, I will<br/>
offer to play mana song full time.  Usually this would involve having a<br/>
chanter/shaman and cleric (maybe 2 of the three along with another int<br/>
caster).  It gives me a break from weaving, which is nice.  However I<br/>
explain to them thsat they need to med close to the fights (thus must pull<br/>
close to the medders).  USually they ignore me, so I go back to singing<br/>
other songs (since mana song ain&#39;t hitting the caters anyway).<br/>
<br/>
When someone tells me what songs to play, I ignore the first time they say<br/>
it.  Then say, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;, the second time.  If they continue,<br/>
it is dependent on my mood.  I will usually just go back to ignoring them,<br/>
but occasionally I will go on a rant about how I don&#39;t tell them what<br/>
weapons to wield, skills to use, spells to cast, etc...  It also depends on<br/>
their &quot;tone&quot;  If they are trying to be helpful, I will merely explain whY i<br/>
am playing what songs I am singing.  Occasionally someone actually makes a<br/>
good suggestion, and I will swtich my melody...<br/>
