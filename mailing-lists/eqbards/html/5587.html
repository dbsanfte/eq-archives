<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-217814867">This was forwarded to me by a friend.  It looks like they are going to stop<br/>
most kiting (5 months too late).  Bards may still be able to kite with<br/>
Bellows and such.<br/>

BRAD ON THE DOT ISSUE - NO MORE KITING<br/>

The kiting fix has nothing to do with range.  Essentially, DoT spells do not<br/>
damage the NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not<br/>
moving or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage.<br/>
<br/>
IF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this point, we will most<br/>
likely also slightly increase  the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>
the additional time necessary to cast the spells and  then set up your<br/>
defense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet tanking, etc).<br/>

Keep in mind that this seems to have gone live already from reports (see<br/>
article below).  Supposedly this is meant to be a kiting fix, meaning if you<br/>
are fleeing from a monster it won&#39;t take damage but if the monster flees<br/>
from you it will. The reports I have in so far basically say if the  monster<br/>
is out of your melee range it takes no damage. It could just be a bit of<br/>
buggy code right   now, but what Brad outlines above could certainly be<br/>
fully implemented come next patch meaning no more kiting.<br/>
<br/>
DOT SPELL CHANGE - LIVE ON ALL SERVERS?<br/>
<br/>
I have had two separate reports now that NPC&#39;s are not taking DoT damage<br/>
once out of the melee range on the public servers. This means the DoT change<br/>
is not just a test server thing.<br/>
It has gone live. I will do some further testing tonight, but in the<br/>
meantime don&#39;t rely on your<br/>
DoT&#39;s if the monsters does a runner on you.<br/>
<br/>
DOT SPELLS -WHAT IS THE GO?<br/>
<br/>
Ok then, here is the story as we know it. Bukaru reports that on Test Server<br/>
if you are not within melee range then the DoT will have no effect damage<br/>
wise.<br/>
<br/>
This basically destroy&#39;s the major tactic for druids in getting experience<br/>
in lower levels if this ends up getting published to the servers.  Kiting is<br/>
finished if this goes live. Whether kiting was ever intended to be a tactic<br/>
by Verant is another matter altogether. I&#39;ll try to<br/>
get an official word on all this from Verant, in the meantime keep sending<br/>
in your information.</div>
