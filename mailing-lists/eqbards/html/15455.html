<div id="ygrps-yiv-143349490">Get thyself to solb, in the window and/or pool room with a group.  dont move <br/>
yourself until you get lvl 46, (when the gks start becoming green).  it took <br/>
me all of 4 days to get out of 40 and 45 in the pool room.  starting at the <br/>
window room and counting the spawn points up top, there are 14 gk spawns, <br/>
that if are broken properly, you can have nonstop pulling all night.  i cant <br/>
say enough about the exp received in these rooms.  bad pull?  there are 4 <br/>
zones fairly close for you and your group.  also you are usually out of <br/>
harms way with the crazy bat/ldc trains.<br/>

&gt;You could try Lower Guk, live side, near the zone.  There are<br/>
&gt;a few shin-level frogs that spawn near there, and make good<br/>
&gt;charming targets (well, as good as live frogs get - they tend<br/>
&gt;to want to attack you all the time).  The dead side will work<br/>
&gt;too (undead are content to attack each other), but tends to be<br/>
&gt;more train-prone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt; &gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Grouping is best.  Best exp 35-40 is Mistmoore.  You can get<br/>
&gt;about a bubble every hour or two there with a competent group<br/>
&gt;that knows how to work around the bugs in the zone.<br/>
