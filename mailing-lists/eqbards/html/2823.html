<div id="ygrps-yiv-795448050">So what makes you think this is something you are supposed to know? Quests <br/>
are often supposed to require some effort to &quot;solve&quot; the problem and not <br/>
just be a straightforward go here and do this issue. This particular <br/>
instance seems to me to reflect exactly the sort of things you encounter in <br/>
life. The job Verant has done is nothing short of spectacular. It seems far <br/>
too easy for some people to be overly critical of anyone or anything that <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit exactly in the mold of how THEY think it should be. Just my <br/>
opinion.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My guess is that once again Verant has failed to write reasonably clear<br/>
&gt;English.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The quest source in Kelethin says who to deliver to in Freeport.  That<br/>
&gt;person says if you want to find out about mail talk to another person in<br/>
&gt;the same room.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know they mean well, but Verant&#39;s consistent inability accurately to<br/>
&gt;communicate what we&#39;re supposed to know results in considerable frustration<br/>
&gt;and wasted effort in the game.<br/>
