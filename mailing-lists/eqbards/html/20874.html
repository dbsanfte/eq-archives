<div id="ygrps-yiv-917052729">My experience has run full spectrum.  Some of my best<br/>
friends on Rodcet Nife are from pickup groups...one<br/>
guy I am grouping with now (mid 30s) I first met in<br/>
Crushbone at 7th lvl and haven&#39;t seen him since until<br/>
this week.   <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;ve seen some really bad things<br/>
too.  I won&#39;t bore anyone with more horror stories, my<br/>
rule of thumb though, is that if I get a bad feeling<br/>
about a group or if they don&#39;t work well together, I<br/>
excuse myself and move on.    <br/>

&gt; On Saryrn we never have those problems.  Even on<br/>
&gt; Veeshan I never had a<br/>
&gt; problem.  Pickup groups were nearly as good as some<br/>
&gt; of our guild groups,<br/>
&gt; some were worse but none were as bad as some of the<br/>
&gt; things you&#39;ve related on<br/>
&gt; this board ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMO Pickup groups are awesome because you get to<br/>
&gt; learn new tactics to go<br/>
&gt; with other people who you aren&#39;t used to grouping<br/>
&gt; with.  Maybe I just adapt<br/>
&gt; on the fly better.  Maybe you just have some really<br/>
&gt; lousy players on your<br/>
&gt; server ;)  Dunno.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with a<br/>
&gt; pickup group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Biggest Key in a pickup group:  Talk about who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; going to do what before you<br/>
&gt; head anywhere in the dungeon.  Don&#39;t wait till AFTER<br/>
&gt; you start breaking the<br/>
&gt; room to discuss who does what.<br/>

&gt; &gt; well let me explain myself then, i was assuming he<br/>
&gt; was going to guk alone<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering he had invis potions, i myself hate<br/>
&gt; pickup groups (remember<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; threads named Group from hell? well i&#39;ve had 2 in<br/>
&gt; a row). So unless you<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; to guk with a group, hope there&#39;s someone in the<br/>
&gt; tower allready so ya can<br/>
&gt; &gt; join up with them, or ya might end up like me last<br/>
&gt; night, with a warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting to the bridge, yelling uh oh and training<br/>
&gt; all the wizards and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gibs to the BR. needless to say i didnt make it to<br/>
&gt; the zone. So ya i hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; for him that unless he has a group allready, that<br/>
&gt; the ass is camped or<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; never get it alone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; At 02:21 PM 8/8/00 -0400, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sure he can form a group, but most chances are<br/>
&gt; the place is camped,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;secondly, if he just wants to go in and out, if<br/>
&gt; its camped means he can<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;there for only a couple spawns as most often the<br/>
&gt; masks rot away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the room may be camped most of the time, i just<br/>
&gt; disagreed immensely with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the part i quoted, i.e. &#39;&#39;first, hope that the<br/>
&gt; ass/supp is camped&#39;&#39;.<br/>
