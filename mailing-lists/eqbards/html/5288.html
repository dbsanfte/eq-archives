&gt; Ok, here is some information I have collected recently that may be of intrest<br/>
&gt; to some of you more quest/lore oriented bards out there.  I hope we can get<br/>
&gt; some discussion going on these topics.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Within my head and inside my brain, I hold the power to set free Ogguk<br/>
&gt; city.  Open up it&#39;s doors to all that is pretty.  Instead, here I am in a<br/>
&gt; pile of my own dung smelling quite dingy.  Drinking Ogre Swill with which i<br/>
&gt; am stingy.  I may have the key, but the point is quite moot.  For you see, I<br/>
&gt; am nothing more than a dumb, smelly Ogre brute.  Thank you, I hope you<br/>
&gt; enjoyed that one.&quot;<br/>

ogre.  Or something to that effect.  Yes, a bullet.  Don&#39;t recall the<br/>
specifics, just that apparently someone&#39;s gunpowder experiment went awry.<br/>
