&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am approaching 10th level and find myself having to make a decision to<br/>
&gt;which I request some advice from higher experienced bards.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;My current situation is this:<br/>
&gt;1)  I fight with either a tarnished long sword or tarnished rapier.  I have<br/>
&gt;max ability in both for my current level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need a better weapon.  I&#39;m still using a Mino axe at level 14.  I got it<br/>
around level 6 or so for 5 pp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2)  I wear a combination of patchwork and leather armor.  My tunic and<br/>
&gt;leggings are patchwork.  Most of everything else is leather.  My AC is<br/>
&gt;around 220 with buffs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a piece of leather at a time until I was full of leather, then<br/>
upgraded to Banded and Magical as I had money.  If you&#39;ve got patchwork, go<br/>
right to banded, don&#39;t spend money on leather in between.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3)  I do not dabble in any of the trades.  I will start brewing once I am<br/>
&gt;able to get my hands on brewing supplies.  Currently, the only place to buy<br/>
&gt;brewing supplies is on the Antonica continent.  I have no intentions of<br/>
&gt;smithing or tailoring to make money.  As a result....<br/>
&gt;4)  I only have about 8 PPs saved up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try getting a party and fighting the bandits in Lesser faydark.  A few<br/>
bronze weapons and you&#39;ll have cash galore in no time.  At level 8, I was<br/>
getting about 20 pp a trip.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My dilemma is what should be my next major purchase.  When I make 10th<br/>
&gt;level, I know I need to go to Freeport to purchase the Anthem de Arms song.<br/>
&gt;Not certain how much this will cost me but I&#39;m not going to make a major<br/>
&gt;purchase until I buy that song first.  With the money I have left over, I<br/>
&gt;need to either buy better armor or a better weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I buy armor, should I wait until I have enough money to buy a banded<br/>
&gt;tunic or should I buy a leather tunic, which is cheaper.  How much better<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;banded over leather?  Currently, orc legionnaires pound the crap out of me.<br/>
&gt;Will leather make much of difference over patchwork?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Should I hold off on buying a weapon and instead focus on looting one off<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a monster?  At 10th level I should be able to survive long enough (with a<br/>
&gt;group) in the Mino caves to get a Minotaur axe.  Does anyone have a<br/>
&gt;suggestion of another place to go to get a better weapon than tarnished?<br/>
&gt;Ideally, I would like to use Crookstinger&#39;s stinger (a magic piercing<br/>
&gt;weapon) if I can get it.  Don&#39;t know if my group would be even strong (or<br/>
&gt;lucky) enough to defeat Crookstinger (a NPC wasp).  Does anyone have an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>idea<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;where in Lesser Faydark Crookstinger appears?  I have never seen him<br/>
&gt;personally nor I have ever heard of anyone fighting him.  I saw a post<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;him on another board so thats how I heard about him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks ahead of time for any response.<br/>
