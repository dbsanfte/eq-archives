&gt;Can I argue some, please?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You talk a lot about enjoyment of the game.  Let me ask you a question.<br/>
&gt;Do the people playing &quot;Monopoly&quot; play for competition or for fun?<br/>
&gt;Imagine the shoe bought all properties at a 1% discount.  Would<br/>
&gt;that make you want to be the shoe?  What if that discount was 10% or 25%,<br/>
&gt;or higher? Eventually it won&#39;t be fun to be the hat, because the shoe<br/>
&gt;will almost always win.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;EQ is a lot like this skewed Monopoly.  The shoe is the unbalanced<br/>
&gt;class, and those that like the Hat or the Thimble want the shoe<br/>
&gt;balanced.  This IS competition, and a lot of people that play, do so<br/>
&gt;for competition, and their fun comes from the competition, not from<br/>
&gt;the play.  That is not a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve had this same discussion going on for about - god...can it be<br/>
almost 3 years now?...over on the UO front.<br/>
<br/>
A virtual world is a new genre - it is not Quake, it is not a board game,<br/>
it&#39;s not even a paper and pen D&D game. A virtual world is persistent, not<br/>
session based. A virtual world will never be &#39;winnable&#39;. There may be<br/>
instances of competition internally (i.e., duals, contests, games, etc.)<br/>
but the competition is geared against the world itself - surviving and<br/>
existing in it - not necessarily against other people.<br/>
<br/>
A &#39;game&#39; IS competitive - it&#39;s designed to have a winner - it&#39;s setup that<br/>
way. That does not mean you can&#39;t enjoy the play aspect of it as well - but<br/>
it&#39;s a forgone conclusion before a &#39;game&#39; starts, someone is gonna win,<br/>
someone is gonna lose.<br/>
<br/>
This is why designers need to decide upfront - is this &#39;just a game&#39;, or is<br/>
this a &#39;virtual world&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Show me what in EQ &#39;let&#39;s you win&#39;? Level 50 - nice things?  Ya know,<br/>
eventually everyone that is persistent enough at trying will get that same<br/>
thing. If you look at others achievements as somehow diminishing your own -<br/>
you are superimposing your own personal competition on the world at large. <br/>
<br/>
The first watershed in a virtual world is the question &quot;Can you win?&quot;. EQ<br/>
has a problem here - it WANTS to be a virtual world - but by setting itself<br/>
on a level based system it gives the illusion you can WIN.</div>
