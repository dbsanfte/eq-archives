&gt; like &quot;How to Implement a Dungeon Crawl in EQ&quot; or &quot;Dungeon Crawls vs<br/>
&gt; Camping&quot;.    Would be interesting to see if Verant gave us their opinion on<br/>

suggested since forever.  Except for JBoots and some of the<br/>
quest mobs, Verant hasn&#39;t done it yet.  That&#39;s why I marked<br/>
the subject Off Topic.  I just considered it a &quot;what if&quot;<br/>
thought experiment.<br/>
