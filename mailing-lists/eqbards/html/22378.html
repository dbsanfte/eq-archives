<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653462564">This is a good idea .. thanks :)<br/>
Honestly, its so  nice you guys are really supportive!  I was feeling really<br/>
inadequate at barding because I couldn&#39;t do this but it seems its really not<br/>
necessary!  If I play with casters, its easy to keep them happy - just play<br/>
mana ALL THE TIME! Haha!  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone is bored and wants to share.. what songs were your standards<br/>
at 35ish?  I usually play iwht a monk or a monk/cleric if that helps...<br/>

&gt; I have done this albeit rare, I generally prefer to watch the <br/>
&gt; battle over<br/>
&gt; staring at the hot boxes.  It was usually only where high <br/>
&gt; resistances were<br/>
&gt; needed, like Kithicor.  I was around level 29 or 30 at the <br/>
&gt; time so I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; a battery.  It was set up like this:<br/>
&gt; Slot 1: Anthem<br/>
&gt; Slot 2: Elemental Rythms<br/>
&gt; Slot 3: Primary hand<br/>
&gt; Slot 4: Secondary hand<br/>
&gt; Slot 5: Inventory slot<br/>
&gt; Slot 6: Inventory slot<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Depending on how fast you get you can do it like this:  While <br/>
&gt; moving the<br/>
&gt; primary weapon out of the primary slot start up your <br/>
&gt; instrument song, drop<br/>
&gt; the primary weapon on the drum in the inventory then drop the <br/>
&gt; drum on the<br/>
&gt; secondary weapon.  Keep the secondary weapon in your cursor, <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt; in the inventory.  Once it pulses start another song and swap <br/>
&gt; the secondary<br/>
&gt; weapon and the instrument, drop the instrument on the primary <br/>
&gt; weapon and<br/>
&gt; equip it.  Once you get good at this you can try taking out one of the<br/>
&gt; inventory slots in the hot bank and replace it with a third song.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt <br/>
&gt; whose main is a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and <br/>
&gt; there... &quot;less<br/>
&gt; &gt;talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three <br/>
&gt; to four songs<br/>
&gt; &gt;but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>
&gt; &gt;question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory <br/>
&gt; slots, and #2 bank<br/>
&gt; &gt;set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, <br/>
&gt; switch to #1, switch<br/>
&gt; &gt;out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new <br/>
&gt; song without<br/>
&gt; &gt;missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one <br/>
&gt; of those things<br/>
&gt; &gt;that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to <br/>
&gt; switch hotkey<br/>
&gt; &gt;banks...<br/>
