<b>Subject:</b> Re: Cazic Exploit and exploit posts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-817514775">Oh, let&#39;s be a little more exact in your re-telling please. An OOC<br/>
comment was made as follows: &quot;I never thought I&#39;d read about a exploit<br/>
on eqbards and see it being used in-game by a bard on that list&quot;. Three<br/>
members of your group replied they were not using any exploit, but you<br/>
were, since I am familiar with the exploit, and you WERE using it. How<br/>
do I know? I made the OOC comment, I was on another character. I never<br/>
sent you any tell, and never said you would be banned, as that is not in<br/>
my power to do so. A member of your party commented &quot;exploits are part<br/>
of the game&quot; to which I replied &quot;and it is a part of the game, that when<br/>
used, is bannable without warning&quot;. This has been stated by Karana&#39;s<br/>
GM-Lead (Mennix) over server broadcast before, you may ask him how he<br/>
feels about people using the cazic temple pathing exploit to verify this<br/>
should you feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want you to feel you didn&#39;t have a face for your accuser,<br/>
which is me. I don&#39;t know whether you read this list before using the<br/>
exploit at the Cazic temple or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact your<br/>
group was using the exploit, and had been doing so for quite awhile<br/>
before I commented on it. Had you truely been naive to what you were<br/>
doing, I suspect any ooc comment from your group would have been along<br/>
the lines of &quot;where?&quot; not &quot;no we aren&#39;t!&quot; as was the case with groups in<br/>
other areas of the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase John Kim, he said, &quot;some people view the pathing bug<br/>
(exploit) as an annoyance, others as an opportunity. Obviously I will<br/>
never agree with you on this issue, since I view bugs and exploits<br/>
abusing them as an annoyance, while you view them as a opportunity.<br/>

&gt; Sorry about responding so late to this, I just got caught up on the<br/>
&gt; list.  All this weekend I was hunting in Cazic and one night 4 of us<br/>
&gt; were doing the Temple.  There was a group at the top and one on the<br/>
&gt; outer area so we stayed on the first rung of the temple and were<br/>
&gt; pulling when we noticed this bug.  Mind you, I hadn&#39;t read the list<br/>
&gt; yet, so I didn&#39;t hear about this exploit.  One pull, we had two<br/>
&gt; lizards and one started to run when we had it to the sliver, so he was<br/>
&gt; heading down the last flight of steps where we killed him.  The other<br/>
&gt; group watched us fighting there on the steps for this pull and after<br/>
&gt; the fight I get a /tell from one of the members suggesting that I<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t use that exploit.  WTF?  What exploit?   He wouldn&#39;t tell me<br/>
&gt; and I slightly forgot about it.  Then while our ranger kept trying to<br/>
&gt; pull and couldn&#39;t get the lizzies to follow him, I decided to try a<br/>
&gt; charm pull, which did make it so I can pull the lizards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few minutes later on OOC, the same guy that had sent me the /tell<br/>
&gt; and one of his guildmembers, were basically accusing me of exploiting<br/>
&gt; telling me I was gonna get banned, all because of the fact that I am a<br/>
&gt; bard and the exploit was posted on this list... which he said later on<br/>
&gt; in OOC.  I tried to explain what I was and wasn&#39;t doing but they<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t listen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a side note, I don&#39;t feel that this list is appropriate for posting<br/>
&gt; exploits.  I don&#39;t want to know about them nor do I want to use them.<br/>
&gt; Just because it was posted here, a few people were accusing me just<br/>
&gt; because I was a bard fighting in the area of the exploit.  So please,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mind the spoilers, but I am sure other people on the list<br/>
&gt; including myself don&#39;t want to hear about exploits.<br/>
