Do you plan on conducting extensive tests against mobs other than green?  If<br/>
green mobs (snakes in this case) have a 30+% chance to resist lullaby, then<br/>
I&#39;d hate to see what blues and above have.  I guess it would require a party<br/>
willing to devote the time to keep healing you over and over again in order<br/>
to get any valid results. <br/>
<br/>
Also, are you going to send these results to Verant/GZ now?  Even though<br/>
your theory that there might be a sign error affecting higher CHR didn&#39;t pan<br/>
out, there still isn&#39;t an explanation of how a level 4 mob resisted 33.6% of<br/>
the time against a 45 bard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I ran a bunch more tests - the equivalent of Lullabying a<br/>
&gt; single Butcherblock snake for 21+ hours.  One thing I noticed<br/>
&gt; immediately is that they&#39;ve changed the max number of mobs<br/>
&gt; that can simultaneously attack you from 4 to 3.  The 80<br/>
&gt; charisma test was the toughest (skunk musk only lasts 5 min),<br/>
&gt; but I think the result with the skunk was either a fluke, or<br/>
&gt; skunks are more susceptible to mesmerization.  So I&#39;m tossing<br/>
&gt; that test out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Charisma doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference (neither does a<br/>
&gt; lute), so the sign error theory doesn&#39;t look good.  But before<br/>
&gt; you start complaining that charisma isn&#39;t working, keep in<br/>
&gt; mind that this could be due to the large level difference<br/>
&gt; meaning the chance to nod is already maxxed (albeit at a buggy<br/>
&gt; level).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, it&#39;s completely obvious that the chance of a secondary<br/>
&gt; resist is nowhere near what GZ said it should be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4 snakes 154 chr<br/>
&gt; 673 nods, 27 resists<br/>
&gt; 700 total<br/>
&gt; 428 nods  (61.1%)<br/>
&gt; 245 partial (35.0%) (36.4% resist rate)<br/>
&gt; 27 outright (3.9%)<br/>

&gt; 4 snakes 110 chr<br/>
&gt; 630 nods, 18 resists<br/>
&gt; 648 total<br/>
&gt; 418 nods (64.5%)<br/>
&gt; 212 partial (32.7%) (33.7% resist rate)<br/>
&gt; 18 outright (2.8%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4 snakes 154 chr<br/>
&gt; 667 nods, 21 resists<br/>
&gt; 688 total<br/>
&gt; 452 nods (65.7%)<br/>
&gt; 215 partial  (31.3%) (32.2% resist rate)<br/>
&gt; 21 outright (3.1%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the 8 snake tests, the total isn&#39;t divisible by the<br/>
&gt; number of snakes because some would wander out of range due to<br/>
&gt; the 3 mob rule, only to return when enough snakes were<br/>
&gt; mesmerized that the wanderers could return to attack.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8 snakes 154 chr<br/>
&gt; 3250 nods, 77 resists<br/>

&gt; 1089 partial (33.3%) (34.4% resist rate)<br/>
&gt; 105 resists (3.2%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Total of all tests:<br/>
&gt; 12735 total<br/>
&gt; 8100 nods (63.6%)<br/>
&gt; 4273 partial (33.6%) (34.5% resist rate)<br/>
&gt; 362 resists (2.8%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to try it with some different snakes next, probably<br/>
&gt; in Freeport (once I figure out a way to stay away from the<br/>
&gt; guards, since I&#39;m usually afk while letting these tests run).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trivia:  The logfiles for all the above were about 2 MB.<br/>
