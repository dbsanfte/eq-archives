<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644445286">I think a point that is being missed...<br/>
<br/>
The classes that have quite a few options for avoiding random encounters <br/>
also can bind themselves anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry so much with my bard.  But I would never start a warrior as <br/>
things currently stand, and my ranger sits alone and neglected unless my <br/>
druid friend is on...<br/>

Not sure about Shaman&#39;s getting camo, but they get SoW at 9th which among<br/>
melee classes is only comparable to Bard&#39;s Acellerando.  I agree it isn&#39;t<br/>
critical that binding be the same throughout the classes, but it would be<br/>
equitable.  Had a good laugh last nite.  actually saw 2 different groups<br/>
/auctioning in S Karana for tanks.  One group went so far as to offer double<br/>
looting for any tank that would join them.  They were still auctioning an<br/>
hour and a half later.  Still think people aren&#39;t bolting from tanks to<br/>
binders?  At least on E&#39;ci its happening.<br/>

Um Necros get it (invisibility) at level 8 and shamans get it at 29 I think.<br/>

Hmmm....you&#39;re right about necros -- Gathering Shadows they call it -- my<br/>
mistake.  I wondered why they had been zeroed out. Don&#39;t know about shamans.<br/>
I know they don&#39;t get it before 20, and the one spell list I have seen that<br/>
has spells up that high didn&#39;t have it listed.  However, even if it is there<br/>
at 29, it is a long time to go before you get it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, though, this is still irrelevant to my main premise,  which is that<br/>
there isn&#39;t a compelling need for melee classes to be able to bind or bind<br/>
anywhere.  I can&#39;t argue that it wouldn&#39;t be more convenient, because it<br/>
would be, I just don&#39;t believe that it is critical.<br/>
