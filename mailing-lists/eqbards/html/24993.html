<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674250343">Ok one other question. I have the corroded plate Helm piece dropped in Kael.<br/>
Once I get 2 more Crushed Coral and do the quest, well this Helm have one of<br/>
those new unique graphics? A guild mate of mine says these unique helm<br/>
graphics are only for the plate dropped in ToV and Kael quests. Is this<br/>
correct? I was under the impression that all 3 class armor quests, Thurg,<br/>
Skyshrine and Kael had the &quot;different&quot; helm graphic. Anyone know the truth?<br/>
<br/>
On the faction issue in CS, if I am loved by the dragons and have great<br/>
faction with them and I start killing the non-named drakes and wyverns, I<br/>
won&#39;t loose any of my dragon faction? If anyone has hunted in CS and<br/>
Icewell, could you please tell me which zone has a better gem drop rate?<br/>

	Icewell and Velk were the two that I&#39;ve found to drop gems most<br/>
frequently.<br/>
	In CS there is no faction hit when killing drakes and wyverns unless<br/>
it&#39;s a<br/>
	named one (Ycolcarn and the named drake I forget). Fairly easy to<br/>
charm kite<br/>
	things on the beach below, and now there is less of a danger of<br/>
getting<br/>
	cremated by ae drake spells since the patch. Before then I was<br/>
afraid to<br/>
	even sit around for any length of time. If someone would train 2<br/>
drakes by<br/>
	you, and I mean even *close* to you, you&#39;d be hit by their ae prolly<br/>
2x<br/>
	each, and at avg of 400+ per shot, that&#39;s 1600 of your hps gone<br/>
right there.<br/>
	Unbuffed at 55 I have a good bit less than that!   /mourn Pava<br/>
