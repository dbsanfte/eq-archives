<div id="ygrps-yiv-127491078">Uhm I tried this and it did not work for me.  Not sure why.  I gave a Aviak<br/>
Charm to a snake and then my newbie bard friend killed the snake. No charm.<br/>
There were 3 full slots on the snake though.  So, I think that the charm was<br/>
lost because the mob had full slots.  Someone here said it will not work --<br/>
period.  But I will try with a burnt stone and see.  Also, I suggest you<br/>
pick fire beetle as your loot mule - the most I recall on them is 2 beetle<br/>
eyes and I&#39;d guess that all newbie mobs have 3 slots.<br/>

else on this<br/>
		list, is to give the item to a mob and then kill the mob to<br/>
loot the item.<br/>
		You can give NO DROP items to NPC&#39;s because of the need to<br/>
be able to do so<br/>
		for quests.</div>
