&gt; Hey what was all that claptrap about Instill Doubt making ships go faster?<br/>
&gt; Was that another of Capt. Rokenn&#39;s inventions gone awry?  That has to be the<br/>

  I&#39;m just saying the game was cool and now it sucks big pointy Cazics, <br/>
  that&#39;s all. ;p  Oh, and now instead of a blocky hill giant warping<br/>
  on top me, a pretty multitextured, high polycount, antialaised giant<br/>
  will be warping on top of me ;)<br/>
<br/>
  As for you Kit, Capt Rokenn doesn&#39;t believe in half measures!<br/>
  You can either join our ranks of elitest pessimists and bash<br/>
  Verant or you can &#39;Walk the plank!&#39;<br/>
