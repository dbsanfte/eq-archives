<b>Subject:</b> Re: Instill doubt & Mana song strategy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-974962426">Yes you can twist mana song and heal song!  I didn&#39;t know it before, but <br/>
heal song actually lasts 3 ticks too like most other songs.  I think the <br/>
same goes with mana song, but it would be hard to tell.  So what I do is <br/>
bring out my lute to play the heal song.  As soon as it starts, stop and <br/>
play the mana song for 2 ticks, go back to heal song for one tick, mana for <br/>
2 ticks.  Works really well for me.<br/>
<br/>
One side effect of mana song is that the healers will heal less.  Since now <br/>
they can regen mana fast, they start to nuke instead of heal.  Instead of <br/>
conserving mana, they want to see who can do the most damage to the critter!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;On another subject, I&#39;m wondering what the best strategy for using the<br/>
&gt;mana song is.<br/>
&gt;Should I even play it at all during combat? If I&#39;m in a group of casters<br/>
&gt;with only 1 tank, I usually do play the song. Or if someone says OOM<br/>
&gt;during combat I&#39;ll begin to sing it and tell them that the song is on<br/>
&gt;and they should stay near me. But I&#39;m wondering how effective this is.<br/>
&gt;Also while resting, everyone tells me to play the mana song, even if<br/>
&gt;everyone has like 2 bubbles of life, which is fine if there&#39;s a healer<br/>
&gt;or 2 in the group. But most of the time, because I&#39;m singing the mana<br/>
&gt;song instead of the healing song, everyone in the group is left with 4<br/>
&gt;bubbles of life.. instead of full life. The priests (clerics, druids,<br/>
&gt;shaman) never heal everyone up to full health. They always leave<br/>
&gt;everyone with 4 bubbles or 4 and a half bubbles of life remaining. And<br/>
&gt;before I got the mana song, I always kept the entire group at full life,<br/>
&gt;but I find that hard to do nowadays since &quot;FM&quot; now translates into<br/>
&gt;&quot;Incoming!&quot;. Usually this seems more efficient if your group can easily<br/>
&gt;handle the stuff you&#39;re fighting, but sometimes something goes wrong and<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re left wondering &quot;Maybe if we all had full life before battle?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Also, at first, I used to juggle healing song with mana song, but this<br/>
&gt;isnt very effective for mana regeneration since it seems that the mana<br/>
&gt;increases only when you see the text message &quot;Your mind clears&quot; instead<br/>
&gt;of there being an icon that lasts for 3 ticks after the song kicks in.<br/>
&gt;Any pointers on the strategy for using this song most effectively during<br/>
&gt;or after combat?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d be most interested in how ye other bards handle this.<br/>
