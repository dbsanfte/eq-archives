<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144106814">The Warrior room has three spawn points, plus can usually grap the 2 hall <br/>
spawns with ease.  The Raider room has 3 spawn points but spawns much <br/>
tougher pickclaws.  On some nights if not too many people are in the zone my <br/>
group had both room spawns and the hall spawns all to ourselves. It was fast <br/>
and furious, non-stop fighting for nearly 2 hours.  The smallest group I <br/>
have help the raider room with was me, and enchantress, and a ranger, we <br/>
broke the spawn up so we had them one at a time and they spawned just as we <br/>
were done recovering from the previous fight.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Highkeep basement (was What to solo at level 27)<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Oct 1999 10:57:00 -1000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went to the first level of the Highkeep basement for the first time at <br/>
&gt;24th<br/>
&gt;level.  Also went back at 25th level.  Due to living in Hawaii and <br/>
&gt;generally<br/>
&gt;playing late at night, its usually not that crowded when I have been there. <br/>
&gt;  One<br/>
&gt;or two groups at most.  Despite this, it seemed there was a very long <br/>
&gt;downtime<br/>
&gt;in between spawns.  I think there are five spawn points on the first level <br/>
&gt;where<br/>
&gt;pickclaws will appear.  Two in the room off to the side.  One by the door<br/>
&gt;leading to that room.  One in a corner further down from the doorway.  Last <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;on the other side of the room in a corner.  There may be more but I know <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;are at least five.  Even though the pickclaws gave good experience, I was <br/>
&gt;bored<br/>
&gt;due to all the downtime.  Didn&#39;t actually time it but I would guess the <br/>
&gt;spawn<br/>
&gt;rate is around 10 minutes for each spawn point.  Is the spawn rate faster<br/>
&gt;further down in the basement?  Are there more things to fight in the <br/>
&gt;basement<br/>
&gt;than on the first level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; Doh! I relized that right after I sent it, LOL.  But the basement is <br/>
&gt;still a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good spot as I never had to wait more then 30 mins to get into a group <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would last for the rest of the night.  It is a great place for casual<br/>
&gt; &gt; grouping, and it is nearly impossible to die there :)<br/>
