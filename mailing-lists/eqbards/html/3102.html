<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162369089">Late one night in Misty Thicket, I met someone who told me I was too young<br/>
for the mobs I was attacking - he prolly saved my life and I dint even know<br/>
it.  I told him &#39;danger is my business&#39; and he laffs and we chat some.  A<br/>
couple times in the conversation he axes me if I am a &quot;paying customer.&quot;  At<br/>
$10/month I hardly call that paying but I finally tell him yes.  And then he<br/>
goes ok if you are a paying customer - here take this mino axe and use it -<br/>
don&#39;t go off and sell it.  I like to think that was Aradune in one of his<br/>
&#39;anonymous&#39; chars.  I kept that mino axe long after I got my combine.<br/>
Eventually, I bestowed the mino axe as a prize to a newbie in West Freeport<br/>
that I managed to cajole into /shout ing a dumb joke to the zone.<br/>

Brad McQuaid&#39;s title is Producer.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, while he can do anything he wants in the game, pretty much, he<br/>
generally doesn&#39;t.  He has regular anonymous play characters on several<br/>
servers,  much like the rest of us, and plays regularly.  You may have<br/>
grouped with him and never known it.</div>
