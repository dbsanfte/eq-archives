<div id="ygrps-yiv-637412062">I can assure you JM is the real deal, well at least there is a JM on the dev<br/>
team.  I have a friend who knows him and several other developers from early<br/>
early beta... like 1 i think.<br/>

&gt; Well J.M. Capozzi laid it to rest a while back.  Jig actually has no effect<br/>
&gt; on mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Course, if you can indeed disprove him then I&#39;d be thinking J.M. Capozzi<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t really with Verant afterall.  I mean I can&#39;t confirm whether or not<br/>
&gt; J.M. is legit.  Is this just someone who just joined the list, and knew a<br/>
&gt; heck of a lot about the game and faked it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, I doubt that J.M. is a &quot;fake&quot; but wish you consider it, for<br/>
&gt; arguments sake.  I have no idea who J.M. is, and have no resource to confirm<br/>
&gt; it for that matter.  Must say, if J.M. were a fake, he or she would be a<br/>
&gt; very good fake.  But who are we, as the grunts, to know who makes the game<br/>
&gt; anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Credits tell us little, as does Verant&#39;s webpage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like how Lionhead did it: they hired an actual journalist with games<br/>
&gt; experience to be part of their team.  You check their webpage, and you have<br/>
&gt; a writer from the inside giving you personal insights.  Get an idea how they<br/>
&gt; actually tick, and it&#39;s very interesting.  You also know who everybody is!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea who makes EverQuest.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I know this thread has been around, Ive been here for quite a while.......<br/>
&gt; &gt;And Ive usually been the bard, but Ive never had the opportunity to time<br/>
&gt; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt;all of my travelling companions swear by it though.  I had assumed by<br/>
&gt; &gt;listening to this list that they were either humoring me or it was in their<br/>
&gt; &gt;heads.  It just happened that I had the opportunity myself and I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;suprised by the outcome.  After thinking about it, if it is truely a<br/>
&gt; refresh<br/>
&gt; &gt;rate my test may not have been very accurate, I tested bubbles 2-4 because<br/>
&gt; &gt;they were the easiest to track.<br/>
