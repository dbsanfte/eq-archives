<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041699664"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At 120 charisma I consider the number of missed notes I get to<br/>
&gt;be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>
&gt;of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>
&gt;this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;how any of you are able to stand it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  With 95 charisma (base) I miss on around 20% of my songs.<br/>
  Mind you, not level 22 or 23 songs, I&#39;m talking about Jig,<br/>
  Selo&#39;s, and Hymm.  It&#39;s truly embarrassing.  It&#39;s like a<br/>
  level 25 cleric fizzling minor heal.  I like to group with<br/>
  players who are around 4 to 8 levels higher than I am, and<br/>
  it makes bards look pretty bad.  Needless to say, I feedback&#39;d<br/>
  the amount of missed notes I was getting recently, because<br/>
  it wasn&#39;t like this before.  And I will always wonder everytime<br/>
  a &#39;spdat.eff&#39; file comes my way, if I have been nerfed again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>
&gt;instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>
&gt;a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>
&gt;tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>
&gt;on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>
&gt;to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>
&gt;frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You and me both brother.  I&#39;m too busy pushing hotkeys to<br/>
  start songs, getting bashed, and figuring out which songs<br/>
  played, which ended, which never even started...  It&#39;s<br/>
  something I&#39;d rather not worry about with songs I learned<br/>
  20 levels ago.<br/>
