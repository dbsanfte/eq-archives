<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447415242">My response was goodbye.  I&#39;m tired of being lied to, led on walks down the<br/>
garden path, whatever you want to call it.  When the Master Spell designer<br/>
states that a song/spell should &quot;work just like mez, but mez lasts a lot<br/>
longer&quot; and that could not be farther from the truth, I think it&#39;s time to<br/>
pack it in.  It&#39;s too bad really, but the ridiculous nerfs of the bard class<br/>
have made it not only not fun to play any longer, but have spoiled the whole<br/>
game experience for me.  When my Druid 5 levels lower than my bard can take<br/>
on mobs that are 5 levels above what my bard can fight effectively (all<br/>
without kiting) there is no balance.  Neither character has an easier/harder<br/>
time getting around, selling stuff, getting into groups etc.  The only thing<br/>
my bard had over my druid was versatility and that has disappeared over the<br/>
course of the last year.  Heck my druid&#39;s level one Snare spell works better<br/>
than my level 23 Chains song does.  I just don&#39;t have the patience any more<br/>
for the BS.  Hopefully I&#39;ll see many of you in a later incarnation.  Now I<br/>
just have to decide what to do until my paid time runs out.  Walking around<br/>
petitioning every &quot;Reallyfubar&quot; and &quot;Bytemiass&quot; sounds like a good use of<br/>
the time.<br/>

Question is - how should we respond if and when they state &quot;It works as<br/>
intended&quot;...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Could you give EsterTheTester a small ring and let her know that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>resistance rates are based on player level NOT spell level?<br/>
Actually there are components of both depending on the spell.<br/>
<br/>
Some spells are inherently more or less resistable than others. An example<br/>
of this is the &quot;Fear&quot; series. The higher levels of the fear series are<br/>
inherently less resistable.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning caster level, it&#39;s not so much the casters level as it is the<br/>
casters level versus the level of the target. Resistance values receive a<br/>
modifier based on this difference.<br/>

<br/>
The testing is complete, the game designers and programmers have been<br/>
consulted, and results are in. I&#39;m afraid that the bards will not like those<br/>
results. We&#39;ll announce more later today.<br/>
