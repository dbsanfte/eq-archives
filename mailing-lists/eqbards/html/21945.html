&gt; &gt; &gt; Really?! Dang! I&#39;m going to have a talk with my buddy then. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They are aoe centered around the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can believe I&#39;m going to start pouring over enchanter spells at EQ<br/>
&gt;Casters right now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looks like they do get a single target spell Whirl Til You Hurl that could <br/>
be used to stun a single mob, but yes, overall enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that this WTYH spell can be used vs the giants. Was very <br/>
interesting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the <br/>
enchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at <br/>
sometime as well.<br/>
<br/>
As for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were <br/>
saying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE mez.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid) <br/>
would pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is <br/>
targetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly, <br/>
find that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is <br/>
filled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>
It has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It <br/>
happens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her <br/>
autoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it <br/>
has made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>
