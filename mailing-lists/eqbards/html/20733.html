<div id="ygrps-yiv-406346784">This story got me thinking.  Very shortly after joining my guild I was on as<br/>
my rogue and knew none of the guildmembers who were on-line.  So I invited<br/>
all of them to come to Freeport and have a drink with me.  Two of them were<br/>
IN freeport and didn&#39;t respond.  I got one to come in from Oasis and another<br/>
from S Karana.  We did nothing but drink, emote, and crack eachother up for<br/>
almost two hours.<br/>
<br/>
That was about 4 months ago.  I&#39;ve recently been on as my bard in the same<br/>
guild fighting with 3 guildmates in Lavastorm.  And it wasn&#39;t until I read<br/>
you post that I realized two of them are alts of the two that joined my<br/>
rogue for a drink and the third is one of their RL sisters.  Finding great<br/>
players beats any loot, I say.<br/>

&gt; My ranger character (my bard is still stuck at 17th) had a <br/>
&gt; good night about<br/>
&gt; a month ago. I was in Steamfont collecting micro servos for a <br/>
&gt; Trueshot bow<br/>
&gt; when the Mino hero pops and starts killing the under 10 crowd <br/>
&gt; around the<br/>
&gt; caves. I was 39 at the time so I have SoW and figure I&#39;ll try <br/>
&gt; kiting him. I<br/>
&gt; got him to 1/2 health but I was nearly out of arrows and <br/>
&gt; figured I might<br/>
&gt; need to drop him on a guard when a 44th level druid swoops in <br/>
&gt; and offers to<br/>
&gt; help. Within 30 seconds there&#39;s a dead mino and the druid <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want any<br/>
&gt; part of the shackle. I couldn&#39;t believe my good fortune. I <br/>
&gt; needed to get off<br/>
&gt; at that point but I made a point to go to Greater Faydark to <br/>
&gt; celibrate my<br/>
&gt; druid savior (he was a woodelf so I figured to do it in his home zone)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I go and buy 9 bottles of something expensive, not sure what <br/>
&gt; wine it was<br/>
&gt; then setup by the newbie lift. I /rollplay and begin to shout <br/>
&gt; my story to<br/>
&gt; the zone. Finally near the end I call out to a first or <br/>
&gt; second season (I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t even use level and circle doesn&#39;t seem right for <br/>
&gt; non-casters) ranger<br/>
&gt; and druid to come to the top of the lift to drink a toast in <br/>
&gt; the name of my<br/>
&gt; savior. I didn&#39;t say I was going to give them a Mino axe, <br/>
&gt; buffs and maybe<br/>
&gt; some coin, I think I had a FS Scim for the druid, so you can <br/>
&gt; imagine the<br/>
&gt; reaction ... nothing. I shouted for several more minutes and <br/>
&gt; finally got a<br/>
&gt; 2nd level ranger. I gave him the axe, buffed him as well as I <br/>
&gt; can and gave<br/>
&gt; up, selling the extra wine back to the vendor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt; at least I now have a Hero Bracers<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Underbrush<br/>
&gt; 43rd level ranger of Tunare<br/>
&gt; Reedwind<br/>
&gt; 17th level bard<br/>
&gt; Terris-Thule<br/>
