<div id="ygrps-yiv-498508212">How many people and what level range is necessary for a Nag Raid?  Are there<br/>
any websites that provide detailed info on pulling this off.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of desire in my Guild to do this - but we aren&#39;t quite big<br/>
enough (and not sure if we&#39;re high enough level).  While we have three or<br/>
four at 50-51 - the &quot;critical mass&quot; level is low-mid 40&#39;s.  And of course -<br/>
getting them all on at the same time is always a problem...<br/>

Ouch, I&#39;m really sorry you lost MM drums.  Now is the time to start pushing<br/>
for Nagafen raids though...  Selo&#39;s Drums of March are a pretty common drop.<br/>
In fact Nagafen dropped two sets for us last time.  ;-)</div>
