<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-426497634">so apparently on the pvp servers you can re-charm before it wears off, is<br/>
that right?  and wasn&#39;t there mention by verant of moving this to the other<br/>
servers?  that would make charming a lot easier and safer.  although i<br/>
prefer charming the more powerful mob in any given situation to have the<br/>
best pet, it is often worse seeing the damage i often take since i have to<br/>
wait for charm to break before i can re-cast it.  sure when you do it enough<br/>
you can get the timing down pretty close, but you are just as often just<br/>
slightly early or late.  then you get a krup knight beating and bashing the<br/>
crap out of you while you try to re-charm.  would be nice if this was<br/>
changed.  just a thought.<br/>

&gt; I could retarget my pet right away, but then I am not dealing <br/>
