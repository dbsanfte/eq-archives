 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re still working with a faulty comparison.  Yes, Bards are <br/>
outnumbered dramatically if you include EVERY OTHER CLASS in the <br/>
opposing view.  But, so are ALL other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the TRUE side:  Only 8% would care about Wizards, 10% about <br/>
Druids... BUT 93% care about PVE.  That&#39;s why the better comparison <br/>
is looking at how close each is to the average.<br/>
<br/>
Assume a server population of 2000.  If all classes were equal, you&#39;d <br/>
expect 143 of each class.  80 Bards are 56% of the average.  160 <br/>
Wizards are 112% of the Average.  200 Druids are 140% of the Average.<br/>
<br/>
Now, assume a total EQ population of 100,000.  If all types of server <br/>
were equal, you&#39;d expect 50,000 of each class.  7,000 PVP players are <br/>
14% of the Average.  93,000 PVE players are 186% of the Average.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all this is meaningless when you consider the original <br/>
question.  EQ is not balanced or developed with a PVP mindset.  <br/>
Songs, spells, and rules are altered to fit PVP, not designed for a <br/>
PVP purpose.<br/>
