<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoore raid event <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900811041">I&#39;m thinking about trying to organize a server wide event in Mistmoore.<br/>
I&#39;ll go into the details of what I have planned in a later message.  What I<br/>
would like to know from any higher level players is the number of groups it<br/>
will take to successfully break all the spawns in Mistmoore and then safely<br/>
hold it.  At 28th level, I have only fought around the lake, graveyard, and<br/>
secret room behind the crypt.  I&#39;m not aware of what all you need in the<br/>
courtyard and in the castle itself.  From my experiences there I think we<br/>
would need the following to control all the spawns:<br/>
<br/>
Lake area: 3 groups(low 20s)<br/>
Graveyard: 2 groups (mid 20s)<br/>
Secret room: 1 group (low 30s)<br/>
Courtyard: At least 2 groups (mid 30s)<br/>
Castle 1st floor: Unknown (high 30s/low 40s)<br/>
Castle 2d floor: Unknown (low 40s)<br/>
<br/>
If you have a lot of experience in Mistmoore please suggest the number of<br/>
groups required for each area.  If I have left out an area please add that<br/>
in as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I realize that Mistmoore is often a wierd zone in regards to bugs and<br/>
lag.  What maximum number of people in the zone do you think is feasible<br/>
before the lag monster kicks in beyond the tolerable point?  <br/>
<br/>
More to follow after I get some feedback on this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
