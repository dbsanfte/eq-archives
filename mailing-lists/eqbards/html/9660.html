<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909805919">i think you are referring to scorn banshees (look like fetid fiends).  i got<br/>
a bard only martune rapier from a banshee (piercing dmg8 del23 5str 4agi).<br/>
i do not know if they now drop our imbrued armor as i heard boogeymen no<br/>
longer drop it but now have necro armor in pof.  the maestro of rancor i<br/>
think is our real best friend.  the first night groups on our server went, i<br/>
did not go and am still kicking myself several days later.  he dropped a<br/>
bard only sword (1h slashing dmg11 del25, i think called sword of the six<br/>
notes).  our best weapon to date, no bards there and it was destroyed =(<br/>
the next night i did go and after i got the rapier (on the very first kill<br/>
of the night) we got to the maestro about 8 or so hours later.  no sword,<br/>
but i did get Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (dex9 cha15 agi9).  i kinda got<br/>
excited and destroyed my normal mandolin before testing and have not gotten<br/>
around to buying another since (sorry mr. kim hehe).  i did try healing and<br/>
i got 25 or 26 per pulse.  i can&#39;t remember what a level 50 with normal<br/>
mandolin heals per tick but i thought it was 22.  i&#39;ll get around to testing<br/>
the effects as soon as i remember to buy a new mandolin =)<br/>

&gt; When you first gate in, the area is safe, nothing will attack <br/>

&gt; much, much different the pof, and imo makes the poh much <br/>
&gt; safer. Spawn is<br/>
&gt; also faster than 12 hours, unlike the pof, WE THINK. Some funky things<br/>
&gt; going on with tracking and we are not positive. We have <br/>
&gt; killed quite a few<br/>
&gt; things so far, and are fairly deep in. Right now we just got <br/>
&gt; slaughtered<br/>
&gt; when our fearless puller brought one too many fetid fiends <br/>
&gt; (well not fetid<br/>
&gt; fiends, they look the same, have a different name that i keep <br/>
&gt; forgetting,<br/>
&gt; spent far too long in the pof :) AND the maestro of rancor. <br/>
&gt; The maestro had<br/>
&gt; a mace, im hoping the bardic mace of ultimate slaying :) </span></blockquote></div>
