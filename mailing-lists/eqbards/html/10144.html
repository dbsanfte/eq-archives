<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054845656">Hello Bards and friends,<br/>
   Seeing that I&#39;m nearing lvl 17, i was curious about a few things <br/>
really...<br/>
<br/>
1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>
<br/>
2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt 6) <br/>
and SBS (shield of course will go bye bye), and a Pugius Dagger (dmg 5 del <br/>
21 wt 2.?) which I use to hone my piercing skills after the PGT has already <br/>
proc&#39;d. [BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or <br/>
mean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you <br/>
think?<br/>
<br/>
3) And what are some good hot keys to have set up as I&#39;m just learning the <br/>
skill?<br/>
<br/>
4) When you auto attack, do both weapons go auto or must you continue to <br/>
click on some key or repeatedly type something?<br/>
<br/>
5) What are some other good relatively inexpensive weapons to use for this? <br/>
Some ideas i have are Bladed Thulian Claws, Dragoon Dirk, and a 1h staff <br/>
possibly a Staff of Writhing. Those are still a little out of my price range <br/>
though; Dirk is not, but no one seems to ever want to let one go. =P Unless <br/>
they just ran across a Runed Bone Fork - in my dreams!!<br/>
<br/>
   Well I guess I can wait on some gift from the Gods or help from you <br/>
friendly wanderers of Norrath. My ears have turned to you folks (good choice <br/>
eh? lol)<br/>
