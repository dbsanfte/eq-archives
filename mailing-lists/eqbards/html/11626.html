<div id="ygrps-yiv-746756984">Nope, definitely looks like a bug as I tested it with and without lute, with<br/>
and without cha buffs.  I saw very little difference, but I am going to try<br/>
and break down all the data tonite to be sure there was no significant<br/>
difference.  Never ever having a duration anywhere between 0 and full though<br/>
suggests there is a bug that makes it not get applied at all, rather than a<br/>
duration extension.<br/>

&gt; that&#39;s the case.  Although from the testing I did, the effect was either<br/>
&gt; full duration or 0 duration.  nothing in between.  I think that makes it<br/>
<br/>
I always thought this was due to biasing caused by Cha and the<br/>
bug/nerf.  e.g. 50% of the time nothing happens due to the<br/>
song being bugged/nerfed.  The remaining 50%, my Cha is high<br/>
enough to cause the song to last the full duration.<br/>
<br/>
I used Pixie Strike a lot to pause battles with mammoths when<br/>
I was L28.  Most of the time it was resisted or lasted the<br/>
full duration, but there were many times when it only lasted 3<br/>
or 6 seconds (I&#39;d get another song started and the mammoth<br/>
would break free, or I&#39;d play another song and start Strike<br/>
again and the mammoth would break free before the Strike<br/>
took).<br/>
