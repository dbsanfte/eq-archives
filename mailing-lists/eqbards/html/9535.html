<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695870470">I made lvl 16 last night and thought I would head over to Highhold from<br/>
Oasis to pick up Aquatic Ayre. Having heard the stories about the GM event<br/>
and all the undead that had spawned in Kithicor I was more than a little<br/>
edgey about travelling through the forest.<br/>
<br/>
As I entered the zone from West Commons the ground was covered with corpses<br/>
that had yet to be reunited with their owners, needless to say this did not<br/>
make me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent prayer to Karana<br/>
and bolted down the path to the South. Just passing the HighHold marker I<br/>
got a tell from someone asking me to hold a sec, so I did and was greeted by<br/>
a Ranger who was looking for someone to do a corpse retrieval for a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I would have happily aided these folk, but being where I was and<br/>
the rumors I had heard I was more than a little hestant. He assured me that<br/>
he and his guild had spent the better part of the day clearing the woods of<br/>
the undead minions, so with his assurances I agreed to begin the search.<br/>
<br/>
As luck would have it, the corpse was nearby, just lost in the famous<br/>
Kithicor fog. The corpse and it&#39;s owner reunited I kicked up Accelerendo<br/>
once again and was about to depart when my trade window popped up and I<br/>
found that the Ranger was giving me 200 gold for my aid.<br/>
<br/>
Somedays it&#39;s good to be a bard!<br/>
