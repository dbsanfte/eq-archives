(though I still haven&#39;t tested different speed weapons to<br/>
determine if this is a flat percentage or a flat delay<br/>
reduction).<br/>
<br/>
Got to see an enchanter&#39;s Alacrity spell (upgrade to<br/>
Quickness) last night.  There were 4 of us fighting 6 goblins<br/>
at the time so I didn&#39;t exactly have time to get my stopwatch<br/>
out, but subjectively I thought my paly friend&#39;s halberd was<br/>
swinging much more quickly than with Anthem.  That makes sense<br/>
since Anthem is a L10 song, Quickness is a L16 spell, and<br/>
Alacrity is a L24 spell.  Celerity is a L39 spell and L36<br/>
song, so I suspect they have the same speedup.  I&#39;d love to<br/>
test it under more controlled situations.  The spells are<br/>
short duration (I&#39;d estimate it lasted about 30 seconds to a<br/>
minute on me), so bards are still better.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, the two we were playing with hadn&#39;t grouped<br/>
with a bard before, and I think I heard their jaws hitting the<br/>
floor when my paly friend and I jumped into a pit with 6<br/>
goblins.  :-)  Paladins are reckless enough as it is since<br/>
they have two lives, and I fear Lullaby has made this one<br/>
reckless even when he&#39;s outnumbered.<br/>
