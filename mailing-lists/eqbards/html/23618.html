<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250359699">Have to agree with the multiple upgrade, no reformat (no reinstalls) - and<br/>
believe it or not .. I&#39;ve even seen no defrag on QA machines (ones that<br/>
install and then overinstall the software to be tested often daily).<br/>
<br/>
It amazing the issues a total reinstall on your machine can fix.  Even on a<br/>
&quot;just&quot; a gaming machine I&#39;d go with completely reinstalling the OS from<br/>
scratch at least once a year.<br/>

&gt; Well, I for one can tell you that I have been running WinME for several<br/>
&gt; months now without problems.  I run it side by side with a Win2k Adv<br/>
Server<br/>
&gt; and have had very few problems with each.  The server has been running for<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; months now without a reboot, the WinME Machine has been outstanding for<br/>
&gt; gaming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think what it really comes down to is this.  What are you using the<br/>
&gt; machine for?  If its work, then security and lower TCO is most likely an<br/>
&gt; issue and I would recommend the W2K series of OS&#39;s.  If the machine is for<br/>
&gt; personal or home use (games / ease of use / intuitiveness) , use WinME.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are two big areas that we have seen people need support on:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  Someone has taken their machine that has gone through EVERY OS<br/>
&gt; upgrade and has never reformatted it or just cleaned up the drive.  (Some<br/>
&gt; issues there)<br/>
&gt; 2.  Someone is taking a WinME machine and trying to make into a high<br/>
&gt; end work production machine...it was never designed to be that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my .02 :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a great day Everyone!<br/>

&gt; My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>
&gt; inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>
&gt; platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>
&gt; comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some<br/>
&gt; responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>
