<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092661052">The below post from Abashi sure makes it sound like we won&#39;t be getting our<br/>
drum visual fixed even in the expansion.  Also, if they said before they<br/>
couldn&#39;t add it because of memory limitations, are they going to have to<br/>
delete some things to add in the Iskar textures? <br/>

Though the system requirements will be increased for the expansion, EQ<br/>
proper must continue to work for the originally published specifcations. As<br/>
such, we&#39;ll have to see how much texture memory we have left after adding<br/>
the Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much individuality can<br/>
be added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must exist in all<br/>
zones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common denominator of the<br/>
old EQ system requirements. <br/>
Now, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will have more varied<br/>
and complex textures than you see in the world now. This is possible because<br/>
those items can only be viewed by people who bought the expansion thereby<br/>
agreeing to the new system requirements. <br/>
