They are almost as bad, as FoH is on Veeshan (Fruits of Heaven, as I like to<br/>
call them) I may be on Mithaniel Mar, but I have had my run ins when<br/>
visiting a friend on Veeshan, and on Illsik Haucil message boards.<br/>
=) Sorry you have to put up with that on Innoruuk. It isnt right.<br/>

  This is very typical, btw.  LoD will barge in and take over<br/>
  anything from anybody, even if plans are made.  This was <br/>
  after a lot of people posted the fall of Cazic, where LoD<br/>
  failed to drop him.<br/>
<br/>
  --clip--<br/>
<br/>
  You got Cazic. Congrats. Couple of you guys are actually using the<br/>
success of many many brave adventurers to try and put down LoD. Tell you<br/>
what, not gonna happen. Wanna know why ? We do things with ONE guild and<br/>
only a couple of SKILLED players. Not throwing numbers at each and<br/>
everything. So like, thinking you can match us or even top us is quite<br/>
silly. It&#39;s two diffrent things ya know. I have yet to see ONE guild<br/>
accomplish anything bigger than taking down the ghoul lord without the<br/>
help of 765743654 other guilds and unguilded ppl. <br/>
<br/>
Again, you made server wide efforts to break fear and finally got it done<br/>
a while ago. Quite an accomplishment. Then, again a server wide effort got<br/>
you the victory over Cazic. Nice jobs. But nothing to brag about and think<br/>
&quot;hey, now we own LoD cuz they didnt kill him&quot; because you can&#39;t compare a<br/>
server wide effort with just one guild killing gods and dragons. The one<br/>
thing is nothing but brute force, the other is skill. No guild on Innoruuk<br/>
other than LoD is even remotely close to beeing able to kill a god or<br/>
dragon. Pantheon may at some point be able to pull it off, but they still<br/>
have a long way to go. But at least they are organized and smart. <br/>
<br/>
But I have to admit that I was impressed you could get Cazic with numbers<br/>
actually. I won&#39;t be impressed again until I see ONE guild accomplish<br/>
something without the help of 7657653473 other ppl. <br/>
<br/>
  --clip--<br/>
<br/>
  This is the bullshit people have to put up with on Innoruuk.<br/>
  I doubt anyone will be able to do either dragons, while this<br/>
  guild exists.<br/>
