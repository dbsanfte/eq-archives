<div id="ygrps-yiv-877982980">I&#39;m very happy with my guild; but the majority are around my level or<br/>
slightly higher.  We have three or four at 50+.  Right around the time one<br/>
of our Rangers hit 50 he was after something in Mistmore and got me a<br/>
Battledrum.  Also a very good number in there 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in no big hurry to get singing - I believe Lambent is fine for my level<br/>
(41).  When enough people in my guild are high enough to get such items I&#39;m<br/>
sure they&#39;ll be free with them (doesn&#39;t hurt that I&#39;m the highest level bard<br/>
in the guild - only one other primary is a Bard and he either hasn&#39;t been on<br/>
much lately...<br/>

&gt; Geez you guys...  Try and get into a cooperative, team-spirited guild.  I<br/>
&gt; logged on last night and had two different guildmates send me tells saying<br/>
&gt; they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still needed them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Last night a 51 Wizard from my guild mentioned that he had a friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; (non-Bard) selling singing armor.  I asked him what the guy wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; per piece and he said 8K.  I think this is absolutetly outragoes.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned </span></blockquote></div>
