&gt; Very true.  The only reason I defer runner-stoppage to snare is because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fire and forget.  If one gets away though I am the stopper because I can run<br/>
&gt; while &quot;casting&quot; and keep the sucker in sight.  I can also stop them at a LOT<br/>
&gt; greater life than a snare can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree it&#39;s better for stopping runners, but you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
defer entirely unless you have a shaman or enchanter doing<br/>
speed debuffs.  Most rangers and druids have gotten a bit lazy<br/>
with snare and just snare at the beginning of a fight.  Unless<br/>
the mob is high red (i.e. you&#39;ll have a hard time getting<br/>
Chain or snare to stick), I&#39;d recommend Chaining for a good<br/>
portion of the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Talk it through with the snarer and try it out - some mobs die<br/>
so quickly it&#39;s not worth it, others you can Chain only to<br/>
about half hp before stopping in order to give the snarer<br/>
enough time to snare.  Others have so many hp you can Chain<br/>
almost until they&#39;re about to run, and the snarer will still<br/>
have enough time to snare.  Once I figured out when I needed<br/>
to stop Chaining, I&#39;d give a quick &quot;Chain off&quot; message in<br/>
groupsay, and the ranger would have enough time for 3-4<br/>
attempts at snare.<br/>

Remember, a 30%-40% speed debuff is not just equivalent to<br/>
increasing your attack speed by 30%-40%, it also means<br/>
regeneration/Hymn and meditation/Clarity are 30%-40% more<br/>
effective, casters have 30%-40% more time to cast without<br/>
being interrupted, and you have 30%-40% more time to react to<br/>
changing combat situations.<br/>
