&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Tranix Crown Disappointment..... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night on Veeshan a few members from 3-4 guilds <br/>
&gt; participated in a Fire<br/>
&gt; Giant run, there were about 7 from our guild and 18 people in <br/>
&gt; total so we<br/>
&gt; had more than enough, things went well and the first giants <br/>
&gt; were killed<br/>
&gt; easily, our monk puller was doing an excellent job and managed to pull<br/>
&gt; Tranix solo, the crown was dropped and I asked to be in the <br/>
&gt; roll for it,<br/>
&gt; there was only myself and an enchanter there that would use <br/>
&gt; it to it&#39;s full<br/>
&gt; potential. But instead it was decided that the enchanter <br/>
&gt; should get to keep<br/>
&gt; the item and that I shouldn&#39;t get to roll for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was really angry to be treated like this especially as we <br/>
&gt; have just got a<br/>
&gt; new charm song, the tranix crown would of been great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just thought I would post this here and see whether you <br/>
&gt; guys and girls<br/>
&gt; think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>
