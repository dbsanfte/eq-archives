<div id="ygrps-yiv-469114806"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean about Shaman buffing without exceeding<br/>
&gt; their regen rate....<br/>
&gt; I can buff TWO people fully before I&#39;m out of mana.  Yes, some of the buffs<br/>
&gt; last longer but if I&quot;m debuffing during the fight, and I am even needed to<br/>
&gt; SLIGHTLY heal, i&#39;m the one holding the group up.  In fact, it is nearly<br/>
&gt; impossible for me to keep FULL buffs up on my groups unless that&#39;s about all<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Let&#39;s put it this way:  Once you buff those two people and you are oom<br/>
  you don&#39;t have to buff them for over an hour.  If you are doing full<br/>
  buffs, then chances are you are not the primary healer.<br/>
<br/>
  My buff lasts a whopping 6 secs.  And is half the power of yours.<br/>
  That&#39;s ridiculous.  Not only does it last 1/600th of the time<br/>
  but it does 1/2 the boost.<br/>
<br/>
  Our party songs should exceed any other player class buffs for<br/>
  the pure reason that they are extremely temporary.  Well that&#39;s<br/>
  my reasoning.  It may not be 100% correct, but sheeeit.<br/>
