designer) made to me was that Origin was offering seminars<br/>
sharing what they&#39;d learned about running a commercial MMORPG.  <br/>
Verant was not one of the companies which signed up to attend.<br/>

Some of the patching lessons Origin has learned have been<br/>
really sensible:<br/>
<br/>
- Patch during off-peak hours as much as possible (something<br/>
about peak times in Asia and Europe making early afternoon US<br/>
the best time).<br/>
<br/>
- Patch just one server first to see if there are any major<br/>
problems that slipped by testing, and only if there aren&#39;t do<br/>
you patch the other servers.<br/>
<br/>
- Your login server must be able to handle the load of several<br/>
servers being down simultaneously.<br/>
