 </span></blockquote>Bard invis (at least at my level) will work against anything<br/>
inside the castle and out.  The catch is, sometimes the<br/>
casters cast see invis on themselves or other mobs.  So far,<br/>
I&#39;ve had the vampire oracle, a thought defiler, and Lasna see<br/>
me at some time but not others.  I&#39;ve also had a gargoyle and<br/>
deathly usher see me.  (&quot;see me&quot; = /con ready to attack even<br/>
though I&#39;m invis.)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to take a group in invis, I&#39;d recommend going<br/>
solo first.  /con everything along the route to make sure they<br/>
can&#39;t see you, or just run the route ready to yell &quot;TRAIN&quot; if<br/>
you don&#39;t mind training other poeple.  If you make it through,<br/>
then probably nothing along the way has see invis and it&#39;s<br/>
safe for your group to go through.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, the vampire oracle has a larger aggro radius<br/>
than other mobs.  There&#39;s a spot in the castle that I thought<br/>
was safe - no wandering mobs moved close enough to aggro on me<br/>
there while I was visible.  Then someone started a train, the<br/>
vampire oracle came by, and saw a party member who was<br/>
standing there and redirected the train towards him.<br/>
