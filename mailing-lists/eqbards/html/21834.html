implement, since for the shield you&#39;d only have to draw an item for the <br/>
right hand for male barbarians. I guess the drum would be a bit more <br/>
difficult since they&#39;d have to draw it for the 3 races plus 2 genders for <br/>
the right hand.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d push for them to just try to get a real drum for half-elf, male bards <br/>
to make sure it works first.<br/>
