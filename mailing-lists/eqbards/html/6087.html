<div id="ygrps-yiv-448794624">Personally, I have found many spots to practice my Wind and Brass skills.  A<br/>
few choice locales that are easy to get to are:<br/>
1.  Follow the right hand wall as you leave Qeynos, heading to QHills.  As<br/>
soon as you zone into QHills you will be in a spot that no MOBs go anywhere<br/>
near.  Make sure you have plenty of food and drink, equip the appropriate<br/>
instrument/song combo, and go see a movie while your character skills away.<br/>
2.  As you leave HPH going into EK, follow the left wall to where it opens<br/>
up and allows you to go relatively far up the wall.  No one and nothing EVER<br/>
goes there.  Set the character up with the appropriate song/instrument<br/>
combo, and grab a good night&#39;s sleep.<br/>
    As a good rule of thumb, any place in along a  zone&#39;s edge where folks<br/>
usually don&#39;t go (for lack of MOBs to kill, merchants, etc) is a good place<br/>
:o)<br/>

I like 21 so much I&#39;ve gona back to it several times now :oP<br/>
<br/>
PS:  Will killing the Kerrans over and over ruin my faction with<br/>
anything/anyone important?  The only faction hit is to Prexuz (sp?)  the<br/>
Oceanlord.</div>
