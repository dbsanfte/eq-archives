<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462527514">Its high enough when you get it, I think. I recently went on a forray into <br/>
The Hole, and<br/>
had no problems picking the lock with a skill of 40. Just hold the lock <br/>
picks and click on the door,<br/>
you will get a message &quot;You have successfully picked this lock.&quot; or similar.<br/>

&gt;I understand a Bards Lock picking skill can be high enough to &quot;pick the<br/>
&gt;rocks&quot; and get in, so where can I go and get practice to get my skill up<br/>
&gt;?  and... what, just hold a pair of lock picks over the &quot;lock&quot; and start<br/>
&gt;using them ? Any advice is appreciated :)<br/>
