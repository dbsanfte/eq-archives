<div id="ygrps-yiv-172759976">It&#39;s the same thing as the invisibility spell, isn&#39;t it?  Or rather<br/>
invisibility + invisibility to undead?  Granted rogues are the only ones<br/>
who can do it without using mana, but then casting classes don&#39;t have to<br/>
move as slowly when their invisible as rogues do when hiding & sneaking.<br/>

what he probably meant was that bards cannot sneak and hide at the same<br/>
time, which is what makes rogues so good at most CR situations.  for rogues<br/>
if you sneak and hide at the same time, you can move around while hidden.<br/>
no other class can do this.<br/>
