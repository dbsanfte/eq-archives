<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720779337">There are no plans to allow bards to bind themselves.  Bind Affinity is for<br/>
pure spellcasters, not hybrids or jack-of-all-trades.  While Bards can<br/>
travel a lot, we are the class that least needs Bind Affinity.  With Selo,<br/>
we can travel much faster than any other class (besides the high level gate<br/>
spells).  And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be the<br/>
most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  My Cleric has traveled much more than my<br/>
Bard, and this was before the Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s does disrupt SoW.  This is most likely a bug.  Selos also disrupts<br/>
Root.  This is most likely the same bug.  Fixing one bug will fix the other<br/>
bug.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game.<br/>
Verant seems to be willing to leave it in for &quot;gameplay&quot;.<br/>

&gt; First off, yeah my character&#39;s name is Barrd (Supposed to be &quot;Bard&quot;, but<br/>
&gt; that damned name filter...), which is a character I&#39;ve RP&#39;d since the good<br/>
&gt; old days of NWN.   So no need to &quot;Hey, great name ;ppp&quot; me, I&#39;ve already<br/>
&gt; heard it all =oP<br/>
&gt; Question, does anyone know if there is any plan in the future for bards to<br/>
&gt; be able to bind themselves?  Just kinda seems silly that we&#39;re supposed to<br/>
&gt; be the most traveling class in Norrath, but can&#39;t bind. =o/  Also, any<br/>
