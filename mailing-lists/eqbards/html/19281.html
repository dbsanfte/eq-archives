<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151596474">We had a similar problem in Frontier Mountains about a week ago.  there were<br/>
40 people in the zone or so for a couple hours and suddenly there were 3 and<br/>
I could see them all.  We had two fulls and a partial group in front of the<br/>
giant castle and all but 3 of us went LD.  No one else in the zone was<br/>
spared.  Luckily the three of us could handle the two giants the groups had<br/>
been fighting, but I hear about 20 people zone-wide died from that incident<br/>
whatever caused it.  Its very eerie to be staring at 12+ LD people at once<br/>
getting beat on by giants.<br/>

I had a serious problem with this the other night in the Overthere zone.  It<br/>
was around midnight Hawaii time and my group (4 others) were fighting<br/>
entire bub of EXP due to lag.  To say the least I was quite pissed off.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time of the disconnect there were only around 10 people in the zone<br/>
and around 600 people on the server.  Thats not enough people to cause<br/>
normal lag so the only explanation I think is valid is there was either a<br/>
server problem or a router problem.<br/>
