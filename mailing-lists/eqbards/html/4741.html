<div id="ygrps-yiv-292010834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Also - it seems some people get better results<br/>
&gt; - I&#39;ve NEVER been able to Riff four songs like<br/>
&gt; some have - so ping/pl time may be a factor -<br/>
&gt; as well perhaps how fast your machine is..<br/>
&gt; I definitely saw an improvement when I went to<br/>
&gt; the quick-key method..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing that best helped me with being able to do multiple songs at once<br/>
is to get out of first person view during a fight. As soon as I attack<br/>
something I hit F9 three times to get to the outside view. This makes me lag<br/>
much less, allows me to see all around me in case something else decides to<br/>
run in and join the fight - and it has allowed me to sometimes get up to 4<br/>
songs going at once because my PC isn&#39;t lagging with all the eye candy on<br/>
the screen. After the fight is over (looting is also much easier in this<br/>
view mode) just hit F9 two more times to return to first person view.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t already do that, try it - it makes life much easier.</div>
