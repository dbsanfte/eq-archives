<div id="ygrps-yiv-72614808">Ok... that&#39;s impressive.<br/>

... But, I manage to hold the CoS mezzed long enough for another hand to<br/>
pop.  I charm the<br/>
hand and do a small circle charm kite (with rogue backstabbing away on the<br/>
CoS, he does a TON of damage).  2 Sup heals (shaman got a slow to stick<br/>
finally. which is good since it summons) later, we have a dead COnstruct and<br/>
a half dead hand.  Which I have no trouble mezzing (and mezzing the curate<br/>
who wandered in) till the clerics meds up, rez&#39;s the 2 fallen, and the rez<br/>
effects wear off.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool encounter...<br/>
<br/>
I would say without a doubt, the shamans&#39;s CHA buff (got me to 183 cha) made<br/>
all the difference...<br/>
