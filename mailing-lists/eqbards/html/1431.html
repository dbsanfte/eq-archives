<div id="ygrps-yiv-439031207"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is clearly situation that the group leader should have taken control<br/>
&gt; of. If I was leading the party and something he was doing was disagreeable<br/>
&gt; with me and the rest of my party I would warn him. If he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; switch his tactics, I&#39;d boot him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there a way for a group leader to remove one person from the group?  Or<br/>
does he have to disband the entire group and reform it without the offending<br/>
player?<br/>
