<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412743533">I&#39;m finding it easier to get the armor quest components versus getting a<br/>
lambent stones.  So far I have five quest components.  I have been<br/>
auctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the patch came out.  I have<br/>
tried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once has anyone had one to<br/>
sell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for them.  Despite killing<br/>
numerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one.  Do lambent stones only<br/>
get dropped in specific zones or can they get dropped in any zone with a<br/>
giant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?   <br/>
<br/>
Also, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests in order to sell the<br/>
lambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I guess its possible that<br/>
people are hanging on to lambent stones so they can complete the quests.  I<br/>
know most of the quest components are NO DROP but I can&#39;t remember if the<br/>
lambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this for me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
