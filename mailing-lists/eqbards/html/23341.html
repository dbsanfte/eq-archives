<div id="ygrps-yiv-537941073">Greetings...<br/>
<br/>
I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The <br/>
question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the <br/>
other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named <br/>
chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava <br/>
walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
