<div id="ygrps-yiv-941017903">Maybe but then the game would be easy as hell and pointless which is<br/>
something Verant can&#39;t do. This is  a very easy game as it is without some<br/>
of those mobs the game would be even easier at the early levels not to<br/>
mention it takes no time to gain the exp back.<br/>

&gt;&gt;What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;See, I am totally from the other school - I have no fun if I AM scared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, not on a continuous basis at least - that is the difference between a<br/>
&gt;&#39;game&#39;, and immersing yourself into a world. Humans cannot create societies<br/>
&gt;based solely on danger - and this is one lesson Verant refused to learn<br/>
&gt;from other games they studied. They did learn the one about setting one<br/>
&gt;group of players up to be fodder for another group - but went just a tad<br/>
&gt;overboard in some areas overcompensating with monsters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I for one am NOT amused when I am out happily gathering silk - or hides -<br/>
&gt;to be wacked in the back of the head by a sand giant or griffin. If I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have a hope of fighting back - thats not fun, thats not scary, that&#39;s pking<br/>
&gt;via monster. Death may be an inconvience at most - but I just don&#39;t like to<br/>
&gt;die - for starters - it tends to break the fantasy - I will avoid death<br/>
&gt;whenever possible by cautious hunting and careful planning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve got like 40 days on my bard played - and only lvl 23 - don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;particularly care if I EVER get to lvl 50 - my main goal in life was not to<br/>
&gt;be jumped by everything and it&#39;s brother while I was going about my normal<br/>
&gt;business. And yes - my bard can outrun most of this stuff - IF I don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;disconnected (which happens to me with annoying frequency - 6 times<br/>
&gt;yesterday). I also play an enchanter a bit - we as bards may be fast - but<br/>
&gt;a lot of classes don&#39;t have that kind of native defenses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Was in Oasis last night with my enchanter - having ubermonsters (to low<br/>
&gt;levels) in the mix also provides the perfect material for high level grief<br/>
&gt;players to work with - was getting trained by specters on the average of<br/>
&gt;every 5 min - for about an hour and a half. Petitioned and petitioned - did<br/>
&gt;a /who all gm - one GM and about 4 guides all on their asses in the plane<br/>
&gt;of air.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I play safe - and I pick my battles - I just don&#39;t like idiots being given<br/>
&gt;the tools to do this, or being blindsided by something in an otherwise low<br/>
&gt;level zone that I can&#39;t even scratch. Guess I don&#39;t find running for my<br/>
&gt;life scary OR fun.<br/>
