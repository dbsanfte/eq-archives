<div id="ygrps-yiv-257883935">I haven&#39;t really noticed that except at the gobbie mines in Ill Omen, and<br/>
then it was only because I would let one go in to agrro the rest (just about<br/>
as soon as I was healed, another would be coming out of the cave at me... I<br/>
called it &quot;auto-pulling&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I was in BWoods at 33 with some mid-40&#39;s guildmates, and had the *hardest*<br/>
time getting anything to agrro on me (from what I can tell, the main aggro<br/>
itarget is the puller... until a nuker lands a good early shot).<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I went back to the giant camp in FV last night (had logged<br/>
off there), and as soon as I logged on, I was invited into the current<br/>
camping group (I love the attention manasong brings   heh!).  Last night&#39;s<br/>
loot was just the opposite from the previous night&#39;s.  I *won* more loot<br/>
last night than what dropped for my group the previous night.  Bad karma?<br/>
Evil GMs playing with the &quot;Loot On&quot; and &quot;Loot Off&quot; switches?  All I know is<br/>
that we had an extremely good group (which I still find as rare for pick-up<br/>
groups), and the exp and loot were non-stop.  The only things that didn&#39;t<br/>
drop were the good giant&#39;s vest and the forest loop.<br/>
<br/>
2 bubbles from Hell 2 (The Sequel).  Gonna spend the majority of my time in<br/>
FM solo&#39;ong my arse off (btw, Gorging Brutes are the *best* solo exp I&#39;ve<br/>
seen in there thus far)<br/>
