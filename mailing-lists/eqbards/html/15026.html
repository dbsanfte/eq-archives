&gt; <br/>
&gt; About a week ago there was a discussion about the gargoyles in OOT and<br/>
&gt; whether a level 22 Bard could solo them.  I expressed the <br/>
&gt; opinion that it<br/>
&gt; would be unlikely based on my own experiences at level 23.  <br/>
&gt; The thread also<br/>
&gt; discussed whether Selo&#39;s could be successfully used on the island.  I<br/>
&gt; expressed the opinion that it would cause too much damage <br/>
&gt; because of the<br/>
&gt; rough terrain.  I was wrong on both counts.  Let me tell you <br/>
&gt; how I found out<br/>
&gt; I was wrong.<br/>

Yay! I&#39;m glad you had a good experience with the gargs. It is nice that they<br/>
do indeed run the same speed you do. Since I usually turned circles on one<br/>
side of the island, I usually used selo&#39;s, but that was mainly because I<br/>
hated always changing my views when running around the island.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get around 25 or so, you shouldn&#39;t have to kite as much, but it&#39;s<br/>
always nice to know you can if you have to. The all instrument attack is<br/>
also useful for clearing 3 skels at a time to open the garg spawns. The only<br/>
annoying thing was that OOT used to have lots of rain and this was before<br/>
they extended how far you can see. I&#39;d expect it&#39;s much better now.<br/>
