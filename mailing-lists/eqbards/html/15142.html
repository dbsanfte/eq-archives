<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022821054"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The current level 27 song does a charm for +10 level.  I.E. to level 37.  So<br/>
how about a charm here that also does +10 levels to level 49?  Goes with the<br/>
current theme.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortantly I don&#39;t think we will ever be DDers.  This is nice but I would<br/>
rather like to see another party buff.  Something that goes along with what<br/>
we already play.  And in preperation for the planes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Already in the game<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>
&gt; such as hymm and clarity)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure this will be left to a Necro only ability, but anyway, how about a<br/>
song that works cross zones to get the bard to there own corpse?  Something<br/>
like a duet between Jonthan and Lyssa.<br/>
<br/>
Also I would love to see Verant break away from the one song a level thing<br/>
and give us some other songs to play with.  I of course want a bind and a<br/>
gate. And a feign death song would make us much better pullers. Ports to the<br/>
stages all over Norath would have to be my absolute most wanted feature.<br/>
