&gt; be soloed by a lvl 32 druid (considering that is how i got mine).<br/>
&gt; According to the druid in question, it was an &quot;easy&quot; solo.  (ie-easier<br/>
&gt; than the ancient croc in uguk)<br/>

  I&#39;m certain a level 32 druid with thistles up could probably knock<br/>
  out the butler fairly quickly.  But the Butler, like many other<br/>
  inhabitants, drops a harm touch (~200 dmg).  And if said druid<br/>
  agro&#39;s the gargoyle that usually stands in there, or agros a <br/>
  hallway roamer - KYAG.  It&#39;s all in the pull vector, and object<br/>
  angles that makes the room look really easy, until the unexpected<br/>
  may occur.  I know, I&#39;ve been there many many times.  Your level 32<br/>
  druid will most likely finish the battle at 4o% mana and 5o% health.<br/>
  I don&#39;t call that easy, I call it doable.  =)<br/>

  Even at L50 those two servant rooms can offer some trickiness<br/>
  which could result in an attempt to gate or die.  It&#39;s just<br/>
  at L50 you have less of a chance to agro things that are several<br/>
  levels green.<br/>
