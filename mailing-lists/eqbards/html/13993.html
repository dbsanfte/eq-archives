<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804228777"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; People are lazy about changing the subject.  :)  I wasn&#39;t very<br/>
&gt; interested in the overcrowding thread, but someone made the<br/>
&gt; comment that they got a chance to play the game as Brad<br/>
&gt; intended - dungeon crawling.  Then I said crawling and camping<br/>
&gt; were mutually exclusive.  Then a bunch of people posted ideas<br/>
&gt; about how to make the game crawling-based instead of<br/>
&gt; camping-based, which is when I started putting (OT) on it.<br/>
&gt; Sorry about not changing the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok you win, sorry :-).  I still say it don&#39;t have a chance of ever flying<br/>
until they solve the over crowding problem though.</div>
