<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839403112">As a Bard I know melee isnt our strong point..but I would like to weild<br/>
some decent 1h slash weapons.. Currently I weild a PGT and a Dirk but I&#39;m<br/>
not so satisfied with the RP and Look of these weapons.. The tomahawk while<br/>
having a wonderful effect isnt the best looking weapon around.. what I want<br/>
are 2 swords...One long and One short in the offhand.. Why are they&#39;re no<br/>
decent 1h slash bladed weapons in this game? Every blade is high level 40+<br/>
and Combine are way to slow to be effective with our allready feeble melee<br/>
skills.<br/>
	I wish there was a comperable Langseax 1h weapon for mid level bards.<br/>
