<b>Subject:</b> My wishlist on the interface <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415198762">I&#39;m on a 56k modem - crappy phone lines in this godforsaken state.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I shall never be the greatest of bards - I do two songs when I<br/>
can - but quite often lag is so bad, I can&#39;t even keep two up at the same<br/>
time from the hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my list of things that bug me about the interface/user<br/>
functionality of the game, fwiw.<br/>
<br/>
1. No slot for my instrument - lag makes it torture to try to switch<br/>
between two weapons and an instrument - why don&#39;t we have a slot and a<br/>
button like a ranged weapon? I could well imagine myself in this situation<br/>
- I&#39;d have my instrument on my belt at my waist - not buried in my backpack<br/>
- and I could sure switch out at least as effectively as a ranger does with<br/>
weapons and a bow.<br/>
<br/>
2. Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to weild<br/>
one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher level bard<br/>
doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured I might be<br/>
able to do this once I got dual wield, but if there is one that lets us do<br/>
it, I&#39;ve not found it yet.<br/>
<br/>
3. Even as long as I&#39;ve been playing (about 3 mths now) I STILL autoloot or<br/>
examine someone when trying to turn with the mouse. Why aren&#39;t looting and<br/>
looking at someone commands instead of automatic? I only have a 2button<br/>
mouse - but would gladly invest in a three button if say, the middle button<br/>
could be programmed for this. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve accidentally<br/>
looted when simply trying to turn.<br/>
<br/>
4. Autorun is almost as bad, I have to find a button on my keyboard, and<br/>
quite often - where I am is so twisty - you just run into things and the<br/>
mob has you, if you aren&#39;t constantly navigating with the mouse. Like most<br/>
folks, I&#39;m right-handed, trying to find things with your left hand on the<br/>
RIGHT side of your keyboard isn&#39;t the easiest thing to do, especially when<br/>
running for your life. Perhaps in the nice open zones this isn&#39;t a problem,<br/>
but in dungeons, twisty hilly zones, it is. Autorun could easily be<br/>
incorporated into the mouse - say holding down both buttons at the same<br/>
time so the same piece of equipment does both functions.<br/>
<br/>
5. Why oh WHY are some critters so hard to target? I&#39;ll be in unrest - 2<br/>
darkbones banging on my crew - a deeth beetle at my feet - and the dam<br/>
deeth beetle is the only thing I can manage to target? I try to use assist,<br/>
but it seems very, very buggy - more than half the time - it just doesn&#39;t<br/>
work. Is there some reason that F8 couldn&#39;t CYCLE thru the nearest mob&#39;s,<br/>
instead of only the one IT thinks is closest?<br/>
<br/>
6. I truly wish there was a quicker way to loot your own corpse - right<br/>
clicking drops it into your inventory instead of putting it on your body. I<br/>
think a check should be made of whether you can wear an item first, drop it<br/>
there, THEN drop anything else into your backpack. Be a simple matter - all<br/>
your worn gear is always at the top first anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I love EQ, and I love my bard - but these are interface problems that make<br/>
me sit back and go &quot;Why did they do this like this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I notice it a little more with my bard simply because there is<br/>
already so much busy work on the keyboard and mouse that I am expected to do.</div>
