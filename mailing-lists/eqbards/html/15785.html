<div id="ygrps-yiv-438960908">Speaking of the Kisch...<br/>
<br/>
    I was camping the front two Lteths this morning before work, when I got<br/>
a /t from one of the other two folks in the dungeon (oddly enough, the other<br/>
two folks had names that were almost identical, and they were hunting<br/>
together... dual accounts?  You betcha.).  He asked me what weapons I was<br/>
using (Thulian Blade and Obs shard), then told me to invis and come on down<br/>
to the area where the Captain used to spawn.  I had forgotten all about the<br/>
blade and it&#39;s nifty properties.  He invited me to group, pulled the gnollie<br/>
in question, layed the almighty smacketh-down (he was a maxxed druid)  on<br/>
it, then told me to loot.  After I looted the Kisch, he and his dwarf both<br/>
buffed the bejeezus outta me, then logged.   Whotta guy!<br/>

&gt;I got lucky... a guild member gave me mine Yk last week and on Friday the<br/>
&gt;Kisch Der Pavz fell for me in Paw :-).  Now I&#39;m happily wield the Yk in the<br/>
&gt;primary and the Kisch in the offhand.  Big difference from my old claws and<br/>
&gt;silvery war axe.  Think the Yk camp is bad?  The Tesch Val Dval&#39;Nmak that<br/>
&gt;drops the Kisch is a 2 hour spawn and his rare is the sword and he really<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t have a common although he occasionally drops a crummy gold ring.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been killing him twice to three times a night for almost 2 weeks.  We<br/>
&gt;got the comando raid down to a science to get in there, kill him and get<br/>
&gt;back out.  Great to have guild members that will drop what they are doing<br/>

&gt;the Kisch.  Imagine my disappointment at that!<br/>

&gt;&gt; How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am<br/>
&gt;CST<br/>
&gt;&gt; in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn<br/>

&gt;&gt; the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; guy after him got a Yak.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the<br/>
&gt;top<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>
&gt;&gt; hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group<br/>
