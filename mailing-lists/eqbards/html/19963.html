&gt; &gt; if the players on test were truly testers, there for the sake of testing<br/>
&gt; the code, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; i would agree.  since they are not, it hurts the players&#39; credibility, not<br/>
&gt; verant&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Uhh thanks so much for your ignorance of the situation..  We are players.<br/>
&gt; We pay $10 per month just like you.  The players who played there and got to<br/>
&gt; high levels SPECIFICALLY so that they could test high level<br/>
&gt; dungeons/areas/planes/dragons were basically paying verant for the<br/>
&gt; priveledge of doing their jobs for them.  People that played on test<br/>
&gt; religiously (I&#39;m not talking about the 5 day wonders that would level to<br/>
&gt; 17th then go back to a live server) were very religious testers.  Most of us<br/>
&gt; have been testing this game since Beta 2 or earlier.  Many of those folks<br/>
&gt; have now left in disgust over their treatment by Verant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMHO:  Anyone who played on Test should have been playing for free instead<br/>
&gt; of paying $10 bucks a month.  Just my opinion though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I leave you with this thought:<br/>
&gt; If there weren&#39;t level 50 players to test the planes, dragons, kunark,<br/>
&gt; etc... how stable would those zones be on the live servers?  Hope you enjoy<br/>
&gt; falling through the world for 32,000 dmg when walking across the plane of<br/>
&gt; hate.  I&#39;ve had it happen.  Have you?<br/>
