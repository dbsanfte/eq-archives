<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833588973">No disrespect Harmonic, but what is it about level 50 that makes players so<br/>
elitist?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on three successful dragon raids now at level 41 and out of all<br/>
three of those raids only ONE of my party members has died.  That sole death<br/>
was due to our Cleric having gone LinkDead early in combat against Lady Vox.<br/>
What I&#39;m saying is that weaving Guardian, Elemental and Celerity (three<br/>
songs) with MM drums in raids on both Vox and Nagafen, I was able to keep my<br/>
tank groups alive and largely unfeared.  As a matter of fact, of those three<br/>
raids my groups have received the kill experience for two.  Of course we<br/>
took battle damage, and on the last run with the LinkDead Cleric I survived<br/>
with only half a bubble of health, but I did survive and the rest of the<br/>
party was above half health.<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic, don&#39;t forget that although the songs at higher levels have<br/>
improved, our percussion skills are already maxxed at 41.  Our party buffing<br/>
abilities (other than perhaps by new songs) aren&#39;t going to improve.  I have<br/>
never done a single point of damage against a dragon and might never.  That<br/>
simply isn&#39;t my job.  My job at those raids is to be a mana pump and<br/>
in-battle buffer.  Just as a cleric is a healer and a buffer, just as a<br/>
warrior is to bash things, a wizard to nuke, nuke, nuke, etc.  I don&#39;t<br/>
resent my role, I understand it and embrace it as do the others in a well<br/>
balanced and successful dragon raid.<br/>
<br/>
I twist three songs during dragons raids without dropping much at all.  Here<br/>
are my tips:<br/>
<br/>
First turn all Hits and Misses off in the chat filters, the spam generated<br/>
from 30 people pounding on a dragon and vice versa is enormous.  I learned<br/>
this the hard way having just mine and others Hits on for my first raid.<br/>
The text messages from songs changing scrolled by so fast in some cases I<br/>
never saw them at all and was just counting out to know when to change<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
Turn particle density to OFF.  The visual cues that you&#39;re used to for<br/>
changing songs will be gone, so use the text messages.<br/>
<br/>
Reduce the clipping plane way down.<br/>
<br/>
Reduce resolution if applicable.  I normally play at 1024x768 on a TNT2<br/>
Ultra, but reduce to 800x600 for dragons.<br/>
<br/>
If you get into battle and find that it&#39;s chaotic, or that video lag is<br/>
terrible, simply look at the floor.  It&#39;s not the best seat available, but<br/>
it helps with video lag considerably.  Watch those text messages.<br/>
<br/>
Wear all the heat/cold/magic boosting equipment that you can muster up.  In<br/>
my case, unlike Harmonic, I never swung a blade so my need for DEX/AGI stuff<br/>
was supplanted by other stats.  To my recollection I&#39;ve never been clawed by<br/>
a dragon, only breathed upon for damage.  This might not have been the case<br/>
if I&#39;d been swinging a blade.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t watch the health of the others in your party.  IMO that&#39;s the cleric&#39;s<br/>
job.  I don&#39;t even watch my own health - it&#39;s only a distraction and could<br/>
cause you to panic.  What are you going to do?  Run?  My job is to twist<br/>
those songs without dropping, so that&#39;s what I concentrate on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   It&#39;s not worth your time to twist those songs.  Here&#39;s why from<br/>
&gt;   my limited experience in both planes, and inside info from<br/>
&gt;   other servers dragon raids:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>
&gt;      With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with all options<br/>
&gt;      off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your misses,<br/>
&gt;      your hits, all spell, all song, I still got lagged something<br/>
&gt;      horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to update 30 people<br/>
&gt;      in a very tight area, nothing you can do about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   2) You will get more attention than you wanted, starting and stopping<br/>
&gt;      a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so as it tripled me<br/>
&gt;      for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted and he clobbered<br/>
&gt;      me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta twist, so twist<br/>
&gt;      the right stuff ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   3) Ok, so you are gonna lag and get beat up a little.  You still<br/>
&gt;      need to twist.  Here&#39;s the kicker.  Your COLD/HEAT bonus from<br/>
&gt;      those songs doesn&#39;t do much.  AE Breath will hit for normal if<br/>
&gt;      your resistance is 25 or 125.  Take it for what it&#39;s worth,<br/>
&gt;      and you may not believe it, but it&#39;s confirmed.  Now, you may partial<br/>
&gt;      resist the dmg, but it&#39;s barely accountable to the resist level.<br/>
&gt;      The biggest single problem is the AE fear when doing dragons.<br/>
&gt;      The best save vs. that fear is being L50... a fear on you even<br/>
&gt;      with MR over 200 at L40 will stick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   4) Your damage counts.  I&#39;ve seen so many people say, Argh!  He<br/>
&gt;      only had a sliver left.  Think if you added your 400 - 500 dmg<br/>
&gt;      into the attack?  You&#39;ve got weapons, use em!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Oh wait... hehe, L41 is mystic shielding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Verant was smart in this way, they gave you a song that boosts<br/>
&gt;   MR by 60 (at L50) without using instruments or twisting songs.<br/>
&gt;   Verses of Victory is amazing... ac20, str30, dex30, atkspeed inc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I never went on dragon trips because you need the right people<br/>
&gt;   for the job.  Extra people or wrong people just clutter up the<br/>
&gt;   scenery and lag everyone.  Back in the day we only had like 40<br/>
&gt;   L50&#39;s, now we have over 200.  It&#39;s just a matter of picking and<br/>
&gt;   choosing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   No disrespect, cause I love ya a lot girl, but L40 bards aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   cut out for dragon raids, unless the server is scrapped for people<br/>
&gt;   at the time of the raid.  Simply because the songs you really<br/>
&gt;   need are higher up, and the level difference really hurts your<br/>
&gt;   DragonFear resist and ability to strike the monster.  As much<br/>
&gt;   as I wanted to go to do them in the past, I had to defer the<br/>
&gt;   work to someone more experienced.  Which is exactly what I did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power (L50) again.<br/>
