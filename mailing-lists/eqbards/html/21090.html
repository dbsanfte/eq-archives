 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s the point.  none of us can know how big the problem really is.  we don&#39;t<br/>
have enough data.  but verant can and does.  which is why they prioritize the bug<br/>
fixes/feature adds and we don&#39;t.  when you say &#39;&#39;from seeing the boards&#39;&#39;, i assume<br/>
you go to all the class specific and the sony boards and you don&#39;t see hundreds of<br/>
posts from other classes on bugs or people posting on general bugs that need fixing <br/>
too?  or do you just read the bard board?</div>
