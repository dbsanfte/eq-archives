<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092076873">Personally I am not as worried about the whole level 50 dilemma as many of<br/>
the players are.  I just don&#39;t have the time, I am lucky if I can play for 3<br/>
hours at a time 4 days a week with a long 6-10 hour session once per weekend<br/>
and at that rate leveling is sloooow.  I have been playing since April and I<br/>
am only at level 26 now so I will be lucky if I hit 50 before the add-on<br/>
comes out, so with that in mind I have a long life ahead of my character.<br/>
<br/>
My big problem is that my playing hours are sporadic and I don&#39;t really have<br/>
a group of people that I play with regularly, I have to run around and find<br/>
a group or get in with some guildmates in order to make any headway in the<br/>
XP department.  This is one reason I like my bard so much though, I have so<br/>
many different ways to play my character and that equates to a long and<br/>
interesting life over the course of MONTHS and MONTHS.<br/>
<br/>
I go in spurts, powerleveling for a bit to get new skills, then kicking back<br/>
and trying to become proficient in them before setting out to get some new<br/>
ones.  On that topic I wanted to talk to my fellow 26+ bards about our level<br/>
26 skill, Instill Doubt. I have never heard this one discussed at all, most<br/>
likely because our level 26 fear song is much better in accomplishing the<br/>
job, but is there anyone out there who can share some experiences with this<br/>
one?  I am also including a spoiler for this skill at the end of this<br/>
message because you can only train for it in ONE place in all of Norrath and<br/>
I found the place.  Here is MY story about Instill Doubt:<br/>
<br/>
I was in N FP last night working on Brewing when a Paladin friend of mine<br/>
came along and I told him I had been fishing in the moat around the<br/>
Paladin&#39;s guild and I then brewed some wine using the fish I caught there -<br/>
I offered him some of the wine and we had a few drinks, then, with my<br/>
fishing pole equipped, standing in front of the Bank, I targeted him and hit<br/>
&quot;Instill Doubt&quot; which initiated that wacky graphical emote that looks like a<br/>
combination of casting a buff and doing a dual-wield attack followed by the<br/>
amusing message &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anyone&quot;.  The funny part was that it<br/>
LOOKED like I was attacking him with my fishing rod and a bunch of people<br/>
were standing around the bank laughing their helmets off at the whole scene<br/>
- someone commented, &quot;Look at that drunk half-elf dueling with a fishing<br/>
rod!&quot;.<br/>

The male bard on the top floor of the bard&#39;s guild in North Freeport is the<br/>
ONLY trainer in the whole game that can train you in Instill Doubt.<br/>

&gt; &gt;no prob, i know its not a flame, i like the discussion.  but <br/>
&gt; as far as my<br/>
&gt; &gt;character, i don&#39;t have all the spiffy items yet, and i <br/>
&gt; still have fun with<br/>
&gt; &gt;her and don&#39;t see the point of retirement.  in fact, my <br/>
&gt; point is that adding<br/>
&gt; &gt;new zones for level 50 characters benefits everyone else.  <br/>
&gt; like i said, when<br/>
&gt; &gt;fear was open we were out of your hair.  and these aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; essentially new<br/>
&gt; &gt;zones, they have always been there and intended on opening <br/>
&gt; but they haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;gotten to it yet.  opening these zones has always been in <br/>
&gt; verant&#39;s plan for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the game.  so with these zones to be opening soon and the <br/>
&gt; expansion, i do<br/>
&gt; &gt;think it is in verant&#39;s plans to have these characters <br/>
&gt; around for a long<br/>
&gt; &gt;time.  hurry up and kabong me Talies before it&#39;s too late! =P<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh - Actually, the reason I haven&#39;t kabong!ed this <br/>
&gt; borderline thread is<br/>
&gt; the fact that gaining 50th *is* important to all of us, and <br/>
&gt; frankly, many<br/>
&gt; of us want to know what we will be doing when we get there.  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s nice to<br/>
&gt; have a goal, but right now, I think some of us see that goal as a bit<br/>
&gt; darker for all that&#39;s been said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What can you tell us about 50th level that will make us want <br/>
&gt; to achieve it?<br/>
