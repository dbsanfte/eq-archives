<div id="ygrps-yiv-876493902">BUT, if you did no damage other than your one &#39;&#39;whack&quot; you shouldnt get the<br/>
kill or get to loot it. Like when monsters get stuck in walls and kill<br/>
themselves. They just die, you live. Thats all. No Exp, no Loot.<br/>

&gt;Oh yes indeedy. But it could also be a really cheap way of killing tough<br/>
&gt;stuff:<br/>
&gt;Fire up Aquatic, hit Selo&#39;s, whack a red mob and leap into Lake Rathe. Then<br/>
&gt;you swim down, way way deep, twisting the two songs. Even if the mob&#39;s AI<br/>
&gt;tells it to go get some air once it starts taking drowning damage it&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt;too deep to make it to the surface.<br/>
&gt;Actually... come to think of it I don&#39;t believe you get xp when mobs die of<br/>
&gt;&quot;natural causes&quot; IE: NPC&#39;s killing them, drowning and maybe falling.<br/>
&gt;Cuz then with safe-fall, we (or those odd, always vicious, monks) could<br/>
&gt;drag minos up to the top of the wall in the Gorge and jump off until they<br/>
&gt;go splat.<br/>
&gt;Ah well, they&#39;ve found a way to defeat all of my cheapness thus far, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think that&#39;ll change ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Speaking of which: I&#39;m finding Mistmoore to be great as of lvl 21+. I think<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s a sweetspot for me right now as my xp is zooming up nicely and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;actually quite fun, regardless of the repetitive nature of what I do there.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m pretty settled in the belief that I need to do that for a few more<br/>
&gt;levels until I&#39;m tough enough to wander around Guk and Cazic (sp?). I think<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been everywhere, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong: is there anywhere<br/>
&gt;else that&#39;s good to us at the lvl 21-24 range sort of thing? I feel I might<br/>
&gt;sicken of Mistmoore sometime this week... once I start venturing in beyond<br/>
&gt;the graveyard. I&#39;ll die tons, get frustrated and spend another 3 days<br/>
&gt;wandering from one end of Norrath to the other, just... being a bard, I<br/>
&gt;guess ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s not too bad, usually, but I just wanna get good xp for the time<br/>
&gt;being - I&#39;m really keen on seeing places I barely know. (Happened to wander<br/>
&gt;into Nagfen&#39;s yaddayadda (can&#39;t remember the name), in Lavastorm the other<br/>
&gt;day (and it&#39;s *not* Najena) but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going there for<br/>
&gt;another 2 or 3 months ;) So if anyone knows of an alternate to Mistmoore -<br/>
&gt;as a backup for when the tedium starts setting in for me in MM please do<br/>
&gt;tell, I&#39;d love to know.<br/>

&gt;Speaking of drowing, does anyone else think that certain monsters other<br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;Aqua-Goblins and such should only have a limited amount of time they can<br/>
&gt;spend underwater before they drown? I&#39;ve been chased into water by things<br/>
&gt;that have no right being there and really should have drowned before I got<br/>
&gt;close<br/>
