It also eliminates some of the dynamics of living in a shared<br/>
universe where the actions of one person affect others, both<br/>
intentionally and unintentionally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you want to stop purposeful training, I&#39;d suggest going the<br/>
factions route.  If a mob is aggressive to you, you take a<br/>
slight faction hit for any non-attacking player it kills while<br/>
you were the last target (dead people are not included, you<br/>
are still responsible for a short time after you zone).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really see purposeful training as a problem (I don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;ve ever seen this).  What I do consider a problem are<br/>
people running/zoning from unintentional trains.  A lot of<br/>
times, the total experience lost due to deaths from this<br/>
exceeds the total experience the running player(s) would have<br/>
lost if they&#39;d just sucked it up and gone down fighting<br/>
instead of trying to zone (I&#39;m guilty of this too).<br/>
<br/>
A slight faction hit for deaths due to trains that are of your<br/>
creation would make people rethink their retreats so as to<br/>
minimize the number of people killed when the do zone.  With<br/>
wide zones like Oasis, I try to ditch trains in unpopulated<br/>
areas (NEVER the beach).  I&#39;d like to see more people acting<br/>
this considerate with their trains.<br/>
