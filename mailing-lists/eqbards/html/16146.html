At L48 this combo was equivalent to a 32 hp/tick regen (33<br/>
hp/tick standing).  With the entire party damaged (which is<br/>
almost always the case against the dragons), that means you&#39;re<br/>
healing 192 hp/6 seconds, or roughly the equivalent of a<br/>
superior heal every 18 seconds.  And you never go OOM.<br/>
