<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;On a side note, does anyone think that drinking alcohol should affect<br/>
&gt; &gt;(either positively or negatively) the effects of bards songs?  As it<br/>
&gt; stands<br/>
&gt; &gt;right now, it mainly improves STR and STA and decreases INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The decrease in DEX already has a negative impact on a bards ability to<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt;an instrument.  However, IMO it would be nice if your CHR went up while<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt;were drunk or duration of songs was increased.  It would definately add a<br/>
&gt; &gt;twist to roleplaying a bard.  Just a thought...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, while I think that there should be some kind of benefit to being<br/>
&gt; drunk with a high Alcohol Tolerance, I&#39;m not sure that a CHR boost is the<br/>
&gt; answer. Hehe. I mean, do you know ANYONE who&#39;s more attractive when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; drunk? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I would classify drunk people into two broad categories: the funny<br/>
drunks and the obnoxious drunks.  Alcohol affects everyone differently but<br/>
some people seem to become more humorous/jovial when they have had a few<br/>
drinks while some people get loud and obnoxious.  Maybe alcohol tolerance<br/>
could tie in to that.  With low tolerance, your CHR decreases a little.<br/>
With a high tolerance, it improves a little.<br/>
