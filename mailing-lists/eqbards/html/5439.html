<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122435966">What a terrible day!  I can empathize with you re. the Ogre camp.  First<br/>
time through that area I came to the top of the mountain..saw the<br/>
Ogres..conned them..and kept running.  I think it took only 3 casts for me<br/>
to die..this was at level 21 or 22...was pretty shocked when it happened.<br/>
Was bound in Freeport also...long run back but at least it was only one<br/>
time.  Luckily my corpse was far enough away from camp that I had no<br/>
problems looting it.<br/>
<br/>
All the way back to my corpse I pictured the Verant programmers snorting,<br/>
laughing, goosing and backslapping each other as they added the code for<br/>
Chief Dooga and slyly placed him in the Ogre camp.<br/>
