&gt; Yesterday I was hunting in CB, and thinking of lore stuff a lot - place is<br/>
&gt; full of it.<br/>
<br/>
Just the shield and tunic.  Maybe the dwarven axes too.  The<br/>
warlord bracer and screaming mace are not (pending) lore.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; For example, I WEAR the dwarven tunic (pending lore at the moment) what if<br/>
&gt; I want to ALSO get the screaming mace - the tunic is a component.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to feel that was the intent of the quest all along.<br/>
Do you want the tunic (and shield and bracer) or the screaming<br/>
mace more?  This is unlike a lot of quests where the item you<br/>
receive is either much much better than what you turn in, or<br/>
is utter crap.  I happen to feel the dilemma you face adds<br/>
character to the quest.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sarcasm&gt; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry you have to operate at 98% potential effectiveness<br/>
using a different weapon in your second hand instead of<br/>
another dirk.  Just think - if you were wielding two dirks and<br/>
found another better weapon, you&#39;d have to operate at 98%<br/>
effectiveness until you could get another of that new weapon.  <br/>
Why doesn&#39;t Verant just make the mobs drop two of each weapon<br/>
at a time?  Oh the horror.<br/>
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The game is perfectly playable using a different weapon in<br/>
your off hand.  What you are complaining about is a &quot;want,&quot;<br/>
not a &quot;need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; While I think it&#39;s a good thing that folks are discouraged from camping and<br/>
&gt; accumulating a dozen of an item, and then squirrling them away, or hauling<br/>
&gt; them to the furthest reaches for sale - selling these items IS a legitimate<br/>
&gt; trade. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the current game mechanics VASTLY favor<br/>
spellcasters for collecting and selling items.  Until this is<br/>
fixed, any argument for making this easier is basically an<br/>
argument for improving things for about half the playing<br/>
population at the expense of the other half.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; By basically ruling out getting another, if you already have one in<br/>
&gt; hand - you are guaranteeing that the folks hunting these critters are gonna<br/>
&gt; be higher levels - and have already moved past personal use of said item.<br/>
<br/>
But that is a smaller problem than we originally had.<br/>
Originally we had both high level players and correct level<br/>
players camping and farming.  Now it&#39;s pretty much been<br/>
reduced to high level players (who won&#39;t use the item because<br/>
they have better stuff) camping and farming.  Because the<br/>
problem is now smaller, it can be addressed with a more<br/>
specific fix.  Divide and conquer.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve already noticed this shift. The only thing that it DOES help with -<br/>
&gt; they get one, move on to sell it, but then they are right back.  Since they<br/>
&gt; are much higher levels, very easy to swipe a kill of one of these mobs from<br/>
&gt; someone around the &#39;appropriate&#39; level to be hunting them.<br/>
<br/>
Brad McQuaid said they&#39;re going to try changing it so group<br/>
damage is summed, instead of just the person with the highest<br/>
damage getting the kill.  While that means a group of high<br/>
level people camping and farming would be unstoppable, no<br/>
longer would an individual high level person basically nullify<br/>
the value of a zone for several dozen appropriate level folks.<br/>
And if they are camping and won&#39;t let you get in a turn,<br/>
petition it - they are effectively kill stealing from you,<br/>
since you are just trying to get your fair share and they keep<br/>
taking it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This also of course presents a problem if your friend dies, gives you<br/>
&gt; consent to loot - and you BOTH have an item - his is gonna poof.<br/>
<br/>
This is a non-issue.  Check with your friend to see if you<br/>
have any duplicate lore items before you loot.  Then you give<br/>
him your item before you loot his.  The only fix that&#39;s needed<br/>
is for you to get a message saying you can&#39;t pick this up<br/>
because you already have a duplicate, instead of the item<br/>
going *poof*.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Not sure what the answer to this problem is - I do think Verant had good<br/>
&gt; intentions with this change, and I agree something needed to be done,<br/>
&gt; however - is the way it&#39;s been implemented causing more new problems than<br/>
&gt; it solved of old?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s much improved.  The high level farming problem<br/>
existed before.  You&#39;re just noticing it more now because the<br/>
appropriate-level farming problem is pretty much gone.  (The<br/>
appropriate-level farming problem still exists with classes<br/>
that cannot use an item camping to sell it over and over.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; One change I think might mitigate the problems - and keep the original<br/>
&gt; intent - let someone only have one of an item in their inventory or bank -<br/>
&gt; but equipped doesn&#39;t count. If item in question, say the tunic is equipped,<br/>
<br/>
We are on opposite sides of the world here.  :-)  See below.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In short, there is no perfect solution to camping - Verant made a good<br/>
&gt; faith effort towards stemming it, if we could just get them to now address<br/>
&gt; the sideissues that the change itself made - I do believe we&#39;ll be a whole<br/>
&gt; lot closer to the original intent.<br/>
<br/>
The solution I liked was to keep list of flags on each<br/>
character of all the lore items in the game.  Once you loot<br/>
that item off a monster, the flag gets flipped.  You can NEVER<br/>
loot that item again.  You killed Crush, you got your tunic,<br/>
hurrah, now move on and let someone else get a shot at Crush.<br/>
<br/>
If you really really wanted two dirks or a second tunic, you<br/>
could negotiate with your druid friend (since he can&#39;t use a<br/>
dirk or Crush&#39; tunic) so that he&#39;d loot a second and give/sell<br/>
it to you.  If you need to loot a friend&#39;s corpse, since he&#39;s<br/>
not a monster, there are no problems.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the ultimate solution is to randomize things more so<br/>
that Crush doesn&#39;t always show up in the same place.  That&#39;s<br/>
effectively what the burnt out lightstone solution did to<br/>
wisps, and kill stealing and camping of wisps has virtually<br/>
disappeared.  That and randomize the spawn times a bit.  So if<br/>
you manage to space out Crush and Dvinn and the Royal Guard to<br/>
where you can tackle them one at a time, that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
guarantee your safety if you camp at the site - for all you<br/>
know the three could spawn simultaneously next time.<br/>
