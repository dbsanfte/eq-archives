&gt;How did the first person who got a language skill to excellent<br/>
&gt;get it to excellent?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hahaha... that&#39;s why I was asking that. ;) I suppose it is possible that<br/>
some people spent 100 practices and 100 plat (which is about what it would<br/>
cost, I would guess) on a language... of course you would only have enough<br/>
practices to do that with ONE language. Of course, that one person needs to<br/>
only teach 10 people for 10 pp each to learn it and he&#39;s made his money<br/>
back... but soon those 10 people teach their 10 friends for free and then<br/>
everyone knows Elder Dragon. =)<br/>
