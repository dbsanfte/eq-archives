dirk.  The dirk had an incorrect treasure table entry and<br/>
D&#39;vinn was dropping it every time for about two months.  <br/>
Since D&#39;vinn spawned about once every 20 minutes, that was<br/>
about 50+ new dirks added to the world every day.  With such a<br/>
huge supply and fixed demand, the price plummeted to 15-30pp.  <br/>
Ever since it&#39;s been fixed so he drops it about 1 in 10 times,<br/>
the price has slowly been going up.<br/>
<br/>
The Langseax is the product of a rather involved quest that<br/>
takes a couple hours to complete.  Also, a key NPC in the<br/>
quest is often killed since he sometimes carries an item for<br/>
another quest.  I&#39;ve often seen Palgin or Basil walking<br/>
around in WK, and not killed them because the quest is so<br/>
involved and I think they only spawn when someone initiates<br/>
that part of the quest.<br/>
<br/>
So the price difference on these two is mostly a result of<br/>
supply.<br/>
