We were in the courtyard, and had cleared it out no problem, when our monk<br/>
camped.  So, I got nominated to pull.  I walked up to the doorway of the<br/>
crypt, and inside was full, one in each little alcove.  I stood just outside<br/>
the doorway, targeted the first one on the left, and started lull.  Resist.<br/>
She ran around the back of the railing, aggroing each mob in each alcove the<br/>
entire way around.  Since most were casters, well, I didn&#39;t last long.  :)<br/>

Dalnir&#39;s is easy to pull...<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s the trick...<br/>
<br/>
use a flute/mino horn/what have you, to lull with (don&#39;t know if it really<br/>
helps, but seems to)<br/>
oh, and my unbuffed cha is about 108, buffed i sit between 116 and 148,<br/>
depending on buff/who/level/etc.<br/>
<br/>
now that you have your targets (up to 3, sometimes 4) lulled, target the<br/>
nearest one, and charm it.  do a /pet guard me and stand there, until it<br/>
decides to wander over.  be ready to be beat on a bit.  shuffle down the<br/>
hall, recharm, rinse/repeat.  warn your group that it will be a pet when it<br/>
shows up, so don&#39;t start nuking until it decides it wants to turn you into<br/>
blueberry soup.<br/>
<br/>
Charming a pet, and not getting too far ahead of it keeps it off the &#39;long<br/>
way around&#39; path where it can collect friends to come make you unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
If you get a resist, well, IF you are really lucky, and you are in a &#39;safe&#39;<br/>
pull spot (i know, there aren&#39;t many, but you got there without attracting<br/>
too much attention), fire a charm off.  AS SOON AS IT LANDS, sit your butt<br/>
down, and camp.  You have 18 seconds leeway before charm breaks (hopefully),<br/>
and 12 seconds for the mobs to run around and come agro on you.  With the<br/>
pathing in Dalnir, you can make it maybe 1/3 of the time, especially if they<br/>
decide to take the really long way around.<br/>
Second option:  curl up in a ball and wait to die. Don&#39;t mob your group!<br/>
They&#39;ll be much more likely to have you around than if you train them.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun<br/>

&gt; Outdoor pulling is no problem, when grabbing wandering mobs, but correct<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; if I&#39;m wrong, but we are *not* dungeon pullers, correct?  As in, pulling<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; mob out of many.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I refuse to pull in Dalnir&#39;s now.  Last time I tried, the first lull on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first mob was resisted...and it took the long way around to get me.  So<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; casters, I was dead faster than I could warn the group.  With that less<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; stellar record, even contemplating trying to lull 2 or 3 before pulling 1<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; less than appealing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m missing anything, but just wanted to check here, and<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; sure.  :)<br/>
