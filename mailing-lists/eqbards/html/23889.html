<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994283559">ya know what they should try to implement... a counter log on DDD, so that<br/>
it counts X ammount of bards used DDD Y ammount of times in Z amount of time<br/>
(lets say a month).  Im sure with all their logging stuff they could do<br/>
this, hence they&#39;d see that its a piece of junk that no one uses.  The snare<br/>
will definetly be a welcomed addition, so is tracking the whole zone<br/>
practically 8)<br/>
<br/>
But I am dissapointed that we got another clarity song (making us labeled as<br/>
a battery earlier on in game) and DDD, well it will keep collecting dust...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve very curious as the hate factor in this patch.  Since we pulse every 3<br/>
seconds, will that put us on the top of the list like back in the old days<br/>
where stuff would run out of the basement in unrest to make a beeline<br/>
straight for you in the courtyard...  Chanters will be happy with the<br/>
lowered aggro where as the mobs will bee line for the clerics doing complete<br/>
heals now.  Better have alot of faith in your taunting tanks now, you&#39;ll<br/>
need them to hit that taunt button alot more now.<br/>
<br/>
Should be an interesting one<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch message....note the bard section and bug fixes.  Verant has<br/>
actually said that our single target snares breaking early was a bug! Also,<br/>
DDD was upgraded...but I have honestly only ever loaded DDD once, and doubt<br/>
I will load it after this fix.<br/>
--------------------<br/>
Source: EverQuest Patch Message. <br/>
Today&#39;s patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes. Due to<br/>
the number of<br/>
changes being made, this list is primarily a summary. Extended descriptions<br/>
of the changes and<br/>
the reasoning behind them can be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards. <br/>
Spell and Skill Changes <br/>
Druids, Shaman, and Clerics: <br/>
Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids. <br/>
Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles) <br/>
New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for<br/>
clerics. <br/>
New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch. <br/>
Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and<br/>
Torpor. This will allow<br/>
them to stack with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over<br/>
time). Prior to<br/>
this, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration<br/>
spells. <br/>
Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy. <br/>
Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana <br/>
Paladins: <br/>
Added Endure Magic spell at level 30 <br/>
Added Resist Magic at 55 <br/>
Moved Guard spell from 49 to 39 <br/>
Moved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49 <br/>
Added New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory <br/>
Added New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing <br/>
Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br/>
Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced. <br/>
Shadowknights: <br/>
Removed artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells.<br/>
Please note that<br/>
post-50 lifetap spells never had an inflated mana cost. <br/>
Moved Spirit Tap to level 55 <br/>
Moved Drain Spirit to level 57 <br/>
Added Drain Soul at level 60 <br/>
Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced <br/>
Moved Shieldskin to level 34 <br/>
Pet buff added at 29 <br/>
Added Diamondskin spell at 59 <br/>
Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br/>
Due to the recent improvements to &quot;Harmtouch&quot;, it is doing much more damage<br/>
than it<br/>
would before and unbalances PvP. As such it will now do less damage in PvP<br/>
(68% of<br/>
PvE, down from 80%). In addition, Shadowknights on the PvP servers were<br/>
routinely<br/>
killing themselves via non-XP losing means and attacking other players with<br/>
Harmtouch<br/>
immediately upon respawn. In order to address this situation, Harmtouch is<br/>
no longer<br/>
automatically &quot;recharged&quot; by death on the PvP Servers. <br/>
The &quot;Lifeleech&quot; discipline now increases hit probability in addition to its<br/>
other effects. <br/>
Rangers: <br/>
Added Endure Cold at 22 <br/>
Added Skin Like Nature at 59 <br/>
Added FireFist at 22 <br/>
Moved Bramblecoat from 49 to 39 <br/>
Added Spikecoat at 49 <br/>
Added resist cold at 55 <br/>
Added Panic Animal at 22 <br/>
Moved Jolt to 51 <br/>
Moved Spirt of Wolf from 39 to 30 <br/>
Added Cinder Jolt (fire-based Jolt spell) at 55. <br/>
Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors <br/>
Added See Invisible at 39 <br/>
Bards: <br/>
Added new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity <br/>
Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors <br/>
Changed it so that the bard spell Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge to increase damge<br/>
by 10pts<br/>
per level over 45. Also made it so the spell does 20% more damage using the<br/>
Puretone<br/>
discipline. <br/>
Magicians: <br/>
Added new level 59 spell: Valiant Companion <br/>
Added new level 39 spell: Summon Companion <br/>
Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can<br/>
damage (all<br/>
rain spells) <br/>
Added level 29 spell for Mages: Expedience <br/>
Enchanters: <br/>
Lowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur <br/>
Bug Fixes <br/>
Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed. Before they would only<br/>
affect<br/>
damage taken and not affect damage dealt out. Now they affect both as<br/>
designed. <br/>
Fixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window was up<br/>
in fullview<br/>
mode. It should work now. Also, fixed a minor bug where if you were in<br/>
normal mode<br/>
and tried to go to the spellbook from inventory via /book or the keymapped<br/>
key it would<br/>
not go, and it would make the done button not work properly for the<br/>
inventory mode. <br/>
Fixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters. In other<br/>
words, if you<br/>
can hit the NPC, he can hit you. This bug was a problem with one dragon that<br/>
could be<br/>
hit, but could not hit back. <br/>
Fixed a bug that made it impossible to &quot;Call of the Hero&quot; someone out of<br/>
water or lava. <br/>
Fixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe. Owners of this item will need to swap<br/>
it out with a<br/>
GM. <br/>
The Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the &quot;Ranged&quot; slot rather than the<br/>
&quot;Ammo&quot; slot<br/>
as before. <br/>
Fixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to break too<br/>
soon in<br/>
some cases. <br/>
Fixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior to the<br/>
loading of the<br/>
faction table upon zoning or logging in. This would cause people to be<br/>
attacked by<br/>
things that normally like them. <br/>
Players should now be properly removed from the group regardless of how they<br/>
exit the<br/>
game. <br/>
Misc Changes <br/>
Added text labels to the fullview inventory window &quot;body&quot; slots (Available<br/>
only to Velious<br/>
Subscribers) <br/>
Added the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use /invwinlabels<br/>
[on/off] (or no<br/>
arguments to toggle). This is saved in the eqclient.ini file in the<br/>
[Defaults] section with<br/>
the key InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE] <br/>
Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors. <br/>
Pickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 45...whichever<br/>
is greater...<br/>
You can pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if you are level 60. <br/>
The mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed when you<br/>
adjust the<br/>
MousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini file. You can set that<br/>
multiple on-the-fly<br/>
with the /mousespeed command. <br/>
The &quot;AutoHelp&quot; feature that can be set under the options menu has been<br/>
enhanced.<br/>
Spell casters in particular might want to turn it on and try depressing the<br/>
ALT key. It&#39;s<br/>
perfect for refreshing your memory in regards to your spell lineup. <br/>
If you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a component,<br/>
you will no<br/>
longer use that component. Jewelers should be very pleased with this change.<br/>
<br/>
Reduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over level 56.<br/>
Spells have always<br/>
previously been set up so that it&#39;s usually more efficient to use a spell<br/>
from a previous<br/>
circle than the current one. The formula did not take into account the fact<br/>
that everyone<br/>
stops at 60. <br/>
Changed it so that players will now lose experience when they die in the<br/>
Arena in Kael<br/>
Drakkel. It seems that people were fighting giants in that arena in order to<br/>
avoid the<br/>
death penalty. <br/>
Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3<br/>
hours<br/>
instead of 3 minutes. <br/>
Avatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack <br/>
Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids,<br/>
and shaman. <br/>
Item Changes <br/>
The effect on the &quot;Frost Giant Beard&quot; can now be used at 35th level rather<br/>
than level 50.<br/>
The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag. <br/>
Iksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield <br/>
Chandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable <br/>
Changed Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth before <br/>
Changed Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could Bash with<br/>
it. Envy is a<br/>
parrying dagger. <br/>
The Shralok Pack is now LORE. It was set to pending-lore some time ago. <br/>
The Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE. <br/>
Donal&#39;s Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every<br/>
7.5<br/>
minutes. This addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent<br/>
given the<br/>
existence of a mana-free complete heal. <br/>
Trades and Crafts <br/>
Fixed the Gator Roll baking recipe. <br/>
Repaired the notetext instructions for creating a Mixing Bowl with pottery.<br/>
Repaired<br/>
Holgresh Fur Cap and Holgresh Fur Moccasins tailoring recipes. <br/>
Made it so that the file is returned in addition to the hammer when a<br/>
character fails to<br/>
forge any of the various chain jointings. <br/>
Repaired Recipe for Enchanted Tier`Dal Adamantite Bracelet <br/>
Made it so that the Dwarven Smithy Hammer is returned on a failure to forge<br/>
Brellium<br/>
Chain Jointing. <br/>
Repaired Field Plate Boots smithing recipe <br/>
Changed the name of the smithed Enchanted Cabilis Scale armor to Imbued<br/>
Cabilis Scale<br/>
armor for naming convention reasons. <br/>
Repaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite Bricks into<br/>
1<br/>
Enchanted Block of Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it was previously only<br/>
possible in<br/>
the Oggok Forge. <br/>
Made it so that the Bread Tin is returned upon a failure to bake bread. <br/>
Mithril and Velium Bonings will be stackable. <br/>
Mithril Studs will be stackable. <br/>
NPC AI - Hate <br/>
We&#39;ve made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section<br/>
dealing with<br/>
target-selection, or what&#39;s commonly referred to as &quot;Hate&quot;. It is not so<br/>
much that NPCs react<br/>
differently to hate now than before, but that we&#39;ve changed the way that<br/>
hate is awarded. <br/>
We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc. Due to the high<br/>
proc<br/>
rates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from procs, and the<br/>
spells that<br/>
were selected for those procs, made keeping the attention of the creature<br/>
much too<br/>
easy a task for the tank. Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of<br/>
keeping a foes<br/>
attention at levels above 50. <br/>
We&#39;ve capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters,<br/>
specifically for<br/>
debuff-type spells like the Malo and Tash series. The hate calculation for<br/>
these spells<br/>
takes into account the number of hitpoints of the NPC and did not &quot;play<br/>
nice&quot; with the<br/>
increased HP limit of Velious. It explains why Enchanters, for instance,<br/>
would complain<br/>
that casting a Tash spell would lead to near-instant death. <br/>
We&#39;ve redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and<br/>
*partly*<br/>
due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete<br/>
heal would<br/>
generate no more hate than greater heal. In fact, so little hate was<br/>
generated by these<br/>
spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial. Heal spells will now<br/>
generate an<br/>
amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.<br/>
Due to our<br/>
desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate<br/>
caps have<br/>
been placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above. Heal spells will<br/>
generate<br/>
significantly less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above<br/>
that level. <br/>
We&#39;ve also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own hate.<br/>
While spells<br/>
in place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let<br/>
them out of their<br/>
damage too easily. A rogue that successfully evaded would immediately drop<br/>
to a level<br/>
of hate lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn&#39;t done<br/>
anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe.<br/>
This problem was<br/>
exacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with<br/>
Velious. <br/>
Tracking <br/>
Tracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and sports<br/>
a nifty scroll bar that<br/>
allows players to see everything on the list. In addition, the /trackplayer<br/>
setting is now saved<br/>
to the eqclient.ini file. <br/>
The following options have been put in for Rangers only: <br/>
/tracksort <br/>
/trackfilter <br/>
/tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order <br/>
Hybrid Casting <br/>
Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher<br/>
levels. The casting<br/>
times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per<br/>
second went up.<br/>
This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more<br/>
damage/second for each<br/>
second taken in casting. <br/>
To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting<br/>
non-beneficial spells that<br/>
have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 %<br/>
reduction in casting time<br/>
for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this<br/>
applies only to<br/>
non-beneficial spells. <br/>
