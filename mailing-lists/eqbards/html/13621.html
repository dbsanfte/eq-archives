&gt; I know of the bear pits in Permafrost (fortunatly I have never been feared <br/>
&gt; into them).  The few times a bear or dire wolf has come to join the party at <br/>
&gt; Vox they provided a nice extra bit of experience.  I was wondering if anyone <br/>
&gt; has ever tried to pentrate down there for some experience camping.  Also the <br/>
&gt; loot ain&#39;t too bad for money, I got a giant dire wolf pelt that sold for <br/>
&gt; nearly 7 plat.  Better and lighter then most FS weapon loot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know any way in other than the ramp from vox&#39;s room or the pits.<br/>
Is there one? <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else find it odd that the ice giants are so badly itemized<br/>
while the fire giants are an event in themselves for loot?<br/>
