<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Shield of Songs vs Nivs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-999897887">One of the best uses i have found for shield of songs is when you are<br/>
fighting greens.  The greens tend to not hit as much and when they do hit<br/>
they dont do as much damage.  The shield of songs tends to absorb mutiple<br/>
hits from these creatures.  This allows you and your party to handle far<br/>
more green critters than you would normally think.  <br/>
<br/>
Myself, a druid and a cleric derailed a train of about 8 of those<br/>
straithbone healing spiders in Kaesora last night, and ended the battle with<br/>
both of them at half mana.  These creatures are green, but can eat a higher<br/>
level party without a real tank if you are not careful.<br/>

On a side note my normal hunt group is now ready for Howling Stones!<br/>
