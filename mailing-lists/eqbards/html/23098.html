<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You should be able to buy fish scales. There&#39;s merchants that sell fish<br/>
&gt; scales and batwings and other spell components. I sure wish I remembered<br/>
&gt; where they were though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only 2 places I know of, there&#39;s a Female Euridite vendor in EC near the WC<br/>
zone about middle of the zone (north/south middle that is). And I think they<br/>
are also for sale in the Freeport casters guild. The EC vendor is on<br/>
Betaneutral faction it seems, she sells to my DE necro as well as my Woodelf<br/>
bard.</div>
