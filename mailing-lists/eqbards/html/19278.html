<div id="ygrps-yiv-192952845">What level should I start thinking about charming Hill Giants?  Am I really<br/>
asking this question???  Never though I would before Kunark, but I expect to<br/>
get deep into Hell#1 this weekend so I guess it is time to ask.<br/>

Hehehe  you can charm up to 5 levels above you.  Even with 200 charisma you<br/>
would hit the 6 level cap.  The 37th level cap is just the max that the SONG<br/>
can charm.  You can only charm about 5 levels above you (and only about 3<br/>
levels above reliably)</div>
