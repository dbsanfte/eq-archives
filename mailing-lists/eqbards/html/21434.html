<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387600085">In Kunark, I have found getting in a group not too hard.  There seem to be<br/>
so many pickup groups that even when you first get on, if there are no<br/>
takers, you can soon form one yourself.  As for knowledge and effectiveness,<br/>
I do know that plays a part.  Many players don&#39;t know we can charm.  But<br/>
when we pull that giant crushing them to pieces off their healing butt, I<br/>
get a heartfelt thankyou and help to educate them a bit.  Or charm that 3rd<br/>
giant when it adds, they all say wow.  I have been in FM Giant Fort a while.<br/>
I am now getting tells from the same people.  They aren&#39;t really friends,<br/>
but they remember I did well with them before.  Makes me feel good.<br/>
<br/>
LGuk is still on my radar though.  We will see how grouping there goes now<br/>
that I am 33.  I need Lambent BP and legs quest stuff and a mask.  Currently<br/>
in OT.  Going to try that today.  I hear if you get in a good chain pulling<br/>
group, xp is awesome there.  I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck all,<br/>
