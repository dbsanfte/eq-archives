That little area behind teh waterfall in Surefall Glad is NOT so little, and<br/>
it&#39;s a death trap if you are anything other than a Ranger or Druid.  That&#39;s<br/>
a not so sevret cave where a bunch of bears live and it&#39;s where part of the<br/>
&quot;poacher&quot; quest for Rangers takes place.  My suggestion?  Dont go back there<br/>
unless you enjoy getting mauled by bears and slaughtered by NPC&#39;s for the<br/>
heinous crime of getting mauled by bears.<br/>

&gt;How about that little area in Surefall Glade where you have to swim<br/>
