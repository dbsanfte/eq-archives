&gt; &gt;In real life I&#39;m Beth Moursund, former Microsoft programmer, currently<br/>
&gt; &gt;Magic: The Gathering rules manager for Wizards of the Coast.  I was an<br/>
&gt; &gt;amateur bard in the SCA for 10 years, and played a harper on several<br/>
&gt; &gt;different Pern MOOs back when I was heavily into text-based online <br/>
&gt;gaming.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So the Bard was a natural character choice for me.  Also, I liked the <br/>
&gt;idea<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a class that was designed to compliment a group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have occasionally had trouble finding a group to party with, but most <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the time groups are very happy to have me join unless they already have<br/>
&gt; &gt;another bard with them.  Most players around my level on Solusek Ro are<br/>
&gt; &gt;very aware of the benefits of having a bard in the party -- especially <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;monks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve only been to the Wizard of the Coast in Northgate...WTF is up with thie <br/>
Pokemon thing?! ack<br/>
