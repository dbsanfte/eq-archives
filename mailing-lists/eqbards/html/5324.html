&gt; Oh man he is a badass, hits for dbl 120&#39;s and is really fast. We fought him<br/>
&gt; twice along with 2 or 3 Zols. All he dropped those times was the Tunic.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the info we were going to ignore him from now on because the<br/>
&gt; Mithril tunic just wasnt that good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, and he can lay hands on himself a couple of times in the fight to<br/>
boot. Our then L35 group died quite nastily in the bottom of that tower<br/>
a few times to him. The falchion is another one of those real rare drops<br/>
Verant loves so much. :(<br/>
