<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735298665"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1)  Am I mistaken, or is it impossible to actually have all of our<br/>
&gt; skills set up on buttons?  I have eight ability-only skills now which<br/>
&gt; require buttons to use them.  I think I can only set up six at once?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  4 combat, 6 abilities.  I cannot fit all my abilities on buttons.<br/>
<br/>
  Use Instill Doubt and Bind Wound in combat buttons, not ability<br/>
  and that will help some.  Don&#39;t put Disarm traps on a buttons nor<br/>
  Pick locks, those skills work without buttons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2)  Anyone know the max on Hide and/or Sneak?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hide 40, Sneak 75.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3)  What does it mean to have a lower/higher Hide skill level?  It<br/>
&gt; *appears* to work perfectly each time.  I hit the button, I disappear.<br/>
&gt; Does skill level determine the length of time that it works?  Or whether<br/>
&gt; the MOBs can see you anyway?  Or anything else at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hide at 40 works about 1 in 5 times for me.  It determined whether<br/>
  you successfully hide, not the duration or the mob fooling factor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4)  Is there any way to know whether Sneak actually worked or not?<br/>
&gt; Other than trying to move and estimating based on your walking speed?<br/>
&gt; What does Sneak do?  Is it just a mobile Hide?  Why do we have Hide<br/>
&gt; then, when you could Sneak and stand still?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No.  Rogues get a message when it fails or works.  We have to move <br/>
  to see if it is functioning.  At 75 Sneak it usually works on the<br/>
  first try.  Sometimes I can Sneak by things that scowl to me....<br/>
  sometimes is the key word.  I use Sneak to sell to vendors whom<br/>
  I cannot CCC.  Rogues can use Sneak and Hide together to move<br/>
  invisibly, we cannot do that, so the two skills are completely<br/>
  independant.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5)  Are they getting rid of Instill Doubt?  Has anyone ever trained a<br/>
&gt; point in this skill?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My ID hasn&#39;t gone up in months, and I practice against pets, snakes,<br/>
  people, corpses, anything.  It just isn&#39;t moving.  I put in one point<br/>
  at the beginning, but the skill is useless for us, since we have a<br/>
  fear song which is 99% more reliable.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6)  Begging 77 now, never got more than a copper (well, I seem to recall<br/>
&gt; having received a silver piece once, but I may be deluded), although I<br/>
&gt; now get a copper more than half the time, it seems.  Anyone with a<br/>
&gt; higher skill who managed to get more?  In terms of cash received, are<br/>
&gt; there &quot;good&quot; begging targets and &quot;bad&quot; begging targets (other than pets<br/>
&gt; and ships)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I have only hearsay on this.  Someone said with max skill you could get<br/>
  plats from things.  I spoke to someone else, and the most they&#39;ve gotten<br/>
  is a silver piece.  My begging is like my instill doubt, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
  budge.<br/>
