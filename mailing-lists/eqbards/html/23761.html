&gt;you add one point of STR, your Attack score raises by one as well.  Makes<br/>
&gt;sense since part of the Attack score determines how much damage you do.<br/>
&gt;Logically, adding one point of DEX should also raise the Attack score by<br/>
&gt;one.  This should get applied to the To Hit portion of the Attack rating.<br/>
&gt;Sadly it doesn&#39;t for a reason known only to Verant.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, actually verant stated what the reason was.  dex does not affect how often<br/>
you hit.  (not that it necessarily matters in this game of EQ, but dex did not<br/>
affect how often you hit in melee in the original D&D and AD&D games either)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Never heard that AC worked in a similar manner until now.  Would like to<br/>
&gt;know which components of AC affect Hit Avoidance and which affect Damage<br/>
&gt;Mitigation.  I would assume your Defense stat and your Agility affect Hit<br/>
&gt;Avoidance and the AC from your armor affects Damage Mitigation.  What<br/>
&gt;happens when you get an AC buff from spells/songs?  Does the extra AC all go<br/>
&gt;to Hit Avoidance, Damage Mitigation, or split equally between the two?<br/>
