<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833973947">I haven&#39;t looked at my RBF in agees, except to put it back in the range slot<br/>
(at least twice last night). Standing around between drake pulls and a<br/>
sphinx says BRILINNIA. We hadn&#39;t even pulled the silly things yet, heaven<br/>
knows how that thing aggroed on me, we weren&#39;t pull group or anything.<br/>
Second death was get a drake add when fighting a sphinx who kills the<br/>
clerics first then the melee&#39;s can&#39;t quite finish the drake off once the<br/>
sphinx drops without healers. I love Sky; hope we&#39;re done up there for now.<br/>
Anyways RBF&#39;s are off a rare spwan in Upper guk but I solo camped for mine<br/>
when I was low 50s. Just have invis up. I found that most trains in Upper<br/>
like to path thru the squire&#39;s spawn spot when going home.<br/>
I use macros alot but I mem the songs I use in the same spots all the time.<br/>
I do make macros for things like dragon raiding and just check the slot<br/>
numbers when I mem the resist songs to make sure I know what slots to put<br/>
the songs in. When not dragon raiding, I just park the hotkey on a back<br/>
page. Macros weave songs faster than I can manually and also help for<br/>
roboing purposes when I&#39;m afk and Klaget has to run me. I have 2 song macros<br/>
and 3 song macros, macros that assist the chanter/cast Occlusion/ say which<br/>
mob is being malo&#39;ed. I switch songs alot, just do it with an eye to what my<br/>
macros are setup as. When we have chanters for haste, I will use a different<br/>
battle song along with SoS and sometimes the 55 clarity/heal. The trick is<br/>
to stay flexible, and be what the group needs at the time they need it. I<br/>
will usually end up singing clarity full time right after the cleric<br/>
rebuffs, especially in HS where you have to keep a constant pull rate going.<br/>
When he gets back on top of the mana curve, I&#39;ll go back to twisting battle<br/>
songs and meleeing.<br/>
 The Commune isn&#39;t a guild I&#39;m familiar with. I&#39;m currently in Excalibur but<br/>
I am usually adventuring with Venator Sapentia, as my RL fiance is also my<br/>
cleric (who is now in VS) and our computers are side by side.<br/>
