<div id="ygrps-yiv-414930673">Gold Box Construction set?  Is that the old Unlimited Adventures?  I had<br/>
similar &#39;modules&#39; using that and plan to continue the process on the new<br/>
Neverwinter Nights when it comes out end of the year.  An interactive<br/>
Baldur&#39;s gate with 100&#39;s of DM&#39;s out there creating virtual worlds.  Should<br/>
be fun.  Only problem I see with your solution is that you&#39;ll just end up<br/>
having groups camping each widget dropping mob all over the place.  Make the<br/>
widgets number around 12 and spread them out as random drops throughout the<br/>
100 or so mobs spread thruout the zone and it might work.  Throw in a couple<br/>
of keys to use to get to the boss mobs area and even better.  Just remember<br/>
not to give the boss mobs LoS to the locked door so no one can make them<br/>
open it for them.  Better yet forget the keys, make them get a rogue or a<br/>
bard to pick the locks.<br/>

Simple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>
with 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>
dungeons).<br/>
<br/>
Every named mob in the dungeon drops a lore, no drop widget (make it<br/>
approprtiate to the dungeon).  The boss has a lor, no drop container, in<br/>
which you put the widgets, hit combine, get the reward.  A really clever<br/>
programmer could even make diminishing returns for not including all the<br/>
widgets.  I essentially did this in many of the Gold Box Construction<br/>
Set adventures I wrote (remember those?).  Usually it was done a little<br/>
more cleverly than that, but you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
With some clever programming, the EQ engine could easily give the game<br/>
we want it to be, just takes some time.  Also I want to volunteer my<br/>
time to them to write the bard song creation for EQ2.  I think JKim<br/>
mentioned it, but I envision a sheet of music paper where you combine<br/>
notes, accents, rests, tempos, etc... The end result is the song you are<br/>
singing.  You learn more as you go up levels, plus the ability to<br/>
combine various techniques into a single song.  How great would that<br/>
be?  It would not be that hard to write, plus a song book (which lets<br/>
you name and save your songs could all be done and saved client side,<br/>
making it easy on the server).<br/>
<br/>
I dont say this to criticize EQ&#39;s bards.  They have done for bards what<br/>
Baldur&#39;s Gate did for thieves.  (made them unique and useful).  I just<br/>
think their base system could be so much more.  How much fun would it be<br/>
to make your &quot;Overture of Wizard Wariness&quot; by combining some elemental<br/>
resitance with a quick targeted stun effect? (I think accented notes<br/>
would give the stun effect personally)<br/>

&gt; A true dungeon crawl in EQ would only work if at the end of the dungeon<br/>
&gt; there was some type of reward that provided enough incentive to not camp.<br/>
&gt; This could be a major EXP gain from killing the boss mob or a treasure<br/>
