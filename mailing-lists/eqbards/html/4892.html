<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403081473">My friend is on a cable modem and I am on a modem that does not connect<br/>
faster than 26400.  8 times out of 10 I will zone faster.  His computer is a<br/>
233 with 64 meg and mine is a 350 with 128 meg.  That is your difference in<br/>
zone time.  The only time my zone time exceeds 15-35 seconds is when I have<br/>
a bad connection (alot of PL)  or there are alot of people in the zone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just because I was interested, I did a little network watching: zoning<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally spews out an odd 300k of data each time for normal density<br/>
&gt; zones,<br/>
&gt; &gt; high density ones (NRO in particular) are closer to 700k.  You might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; tempted to think wow, with a DSL I can zone in 10 secs!  But you also<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; the overhead associated with loading the new zone data from disk, which<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; time consuming in and of itself.  If you have a new computer, chances<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suspect most of the time to zone is spent uncompressing that<br/>
&gt; data being sent from the server.  This was also the case for<br/>
&gt; Diablo - copying the CD to hard disk only helped to a point,<br/>
&gt; but upgrading the CPU helped tremendously.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FWIW, on my cable modem and 450 Celeron (OC) with 128MB RAM,<br/>
&gt; it takes from 15-35 seconds to zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, on to ping.  Its just not that great of an indication.  Speaking<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience (I&#39;m a network programming and sysadmin), opening a socket is<br/>
&gt; FAR<br/>
&gt; &gt; more reliable.  I&#39;ve got a really quick and dirty pong program which<br/>
&gt; does<br/>
&gt; &gt; just this as well as dumping out oodles of other interesting network<br/>
&gt; info.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, comparing ping times for the same route (assuming<br/>
&gt; relatively constant Internet traffic) using two different<br/>
&gt; modems *will* tell you the relative performance of those two<br/>
&gt; modems, since the times across all the other hops should stay<br/>
&gt; roughly the same.<br/>
