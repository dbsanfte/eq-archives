<blockquote><span title="qreply">     &gt;Sounds like the Blackened Iron Crown should work for you.  Its AC5 invisible I believe, &gt;and ads 5 to STR and 5 to all resistances, found in RunnyEye I hope to get one myself &gt;someday.<br/>

    &gt;Regarding appearance: <br/>
    &gt;As a bard I am interested in my appearance to my audience.  Of course <br/>
    &gt;protecting my hide is also important!  I am searching for effective <br/>
    &gt;armor which is either invisible or attractive (not a tin pot on the <br/>
    &gt;head) for a female half-elf. </span></blockquote></div>
