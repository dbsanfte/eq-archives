<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809480425">it&#39;s a lot of fun, we did it on mith marr a couple of weeks ago.  my group<br/>
and another group were doing fire giants and eventually warlord skarlon.  it<br/>
is something like an 8 hour respawn on FGs, so we are sitting down there and<br/>
figured we were there already, and nothing cool has been done like this on<br/>
mith marr, so we put out the word and ended up with 8 full groups<br/>
surprisingly.  about half of us died, but what a blast.  he dropped the<br/>
shaman-only hammer Scourge, a couple Bladestopper shields, a rune and a bag.<br/>
not the best loot, but best time we all had in a while.<br/>
