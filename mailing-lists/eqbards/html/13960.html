&gt; &gt; from the L50 viewpoint.  But you&#39;re like a fishing buddy I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have.  He knows a lot about fishing technique and style, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t believe anything he says with numbers in it.  He&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a numbers kind of guy.)<br/>

but the odd thing was if I divided all the fish weights and<br/>

&quot;Yeah, we caught a 110 pound bluefin at Cortez.&quot;  Look it up<br/>
in the fishing news the next day and it&#39;s a 65 pound bluefin.  <br/>
&quot;35 pound yellowtail, we weighed it on the boat.&quot;  Weigh it on<br/>
my scale and it&#39;s 20 pounds.  And on and on.  Eerie.<br/>
