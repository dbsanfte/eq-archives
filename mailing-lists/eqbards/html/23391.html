<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305668507">Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me <br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I <br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s <br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that <br/>
certain something that my bard does.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical <br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and <br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with <br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out <br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever <br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.  <br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and <br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life <br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!</div>
