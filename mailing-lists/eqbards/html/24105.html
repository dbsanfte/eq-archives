Here&#39;s my map of Sol A...<br/>

The Goblin High Shamen drops the glowing stone band. if I recall correctly,<br/>
the map is slightly dated. The High shamen actually spawns in the room just<br/>
to the east of the #17 on the map. There should be 4 spawns in the room<br/>
marked 17 and 2 spawns in the room to the east.<br/>
<br/>
Invis works fairly well here, just remember that wizards, shamen and<br/>
solussek grade goblins can all see through it. Most of the time though, you<br/>
can get there unmolested. In so far as camping, the room that is North and<br/>
East of the room where the High Sham spawns (the one with the grey corridor<br/>
leading out of it) has no spawns in it and is a good place to camp. It is<br/>
accessible through a secret wall in the hall outside of the room marked 17.<br/>
