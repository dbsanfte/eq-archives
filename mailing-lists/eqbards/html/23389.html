<div id="ygrps-yiv-205560430">pickups are easy in karnors, i enter do a lfg and get 2-3 tells right away<br/>
80% of the time, if no takers i go outside to ridge, either way this is the<br/>
area that is best for me to get pickup groups early in the morning before<br/>
going to work and getting good xp since im not on for very long.<br/>

(Obviously these observations are based on my experiences on my server on<br/>
Xegony).<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t get into a group in Sebelis at 47.  I couldn&#39;t at 49.  Chardok is<br/>
very underused and getting a pickup group there is normally unlikely at best<br/>
at any level.  Karnor is difficult - but in the right group - you might be<br/>
okay.   I did the Dog tower at about that level.  They had a really good<br/>
group with cleric and enchanter - and basically told me to stand back and be<br/>
careful what I sang to not agro the mobs enough to become a target.<br/>
<br/>
	Again - I think your odds of getting a pickup group are low - and it<br/>
will<br/>
be risky.  However if you have a pre-made group that wants you - rock on -<br/>
and hope for the best!<br/>

Sorry, imho, 47 is &quot;too low&quot; for Karnors, Seb and Chardok. I would say 50 is<br/>
too low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>
these places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>
you can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>
groups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>
do with class specific issues.  It&#39;s purely a level thing.<br/>
