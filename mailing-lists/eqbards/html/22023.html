i hit 41 yesterday morning finally kiting giants. After a couple hours my<br/>
girlfriend was getting impatient with me so i told her ya ya im loggin after<br/>
this one (i had 2). Pet killed 1 then i killed the pet which made me ding<br/>
and log a happy camper. Glad to see an old timer is back in the roll of<br/>
things 8).  It was really a good day, my friend hit level 60 with his<br/>
warrior so now he gonna help me level up woohoo. He also wants to twink<br/>

Hey, Minkin<br/>
<br/>
yeah, it&#39;s me...been a long while<br/>
Mac got stuck in a rut for a long while (5 months?), died 37 times getting<br/>
from 22 to 23 (yes folks, that&#39;s 37 dings to 23)<br/>
I started playing an enchanter, warrior and monk for a while.  my guild<br/>
finally has a mess of people my level, so i&#39;m getting bac into the swing of<br/>
things.  Heck, I got 4.5 bubbles of xp in level 26 one night in lower guk<br/>
(yeah, we did lower guk with two groups from 26 (me) to 33 (cleric), and got<br/>
hellacious xp.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a holler in game sometime.  I catch up with Halana/Tani every once<br/>
in a while, as well.<br/>
