<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347458504">Dendall, perhaps your original post was as hasten as those posting their<br/>
&quot;misinformation&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I hear your apology and I accept it.  I can only read the words that you<br/>
post, I can not try to determine what you actually meant by them.  Your<br/>
explanation about not wanting to get petty and point fingers sounds very<br/>
reasonable and I accept it as your true meaning.  Please also understand the<br/>
feeling I and others have had about the original post.  We only can see<br/>
what&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;First, let me apologize for a poorly worded sentence. I said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt;&gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt;&gt; truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In my attempt to be brief, I realize I sounded like I was saying I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;WANT to correct things. What I meant to imply is that I don&#39;t want to get<br/>
&gt;petty and point fingers at people after the fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No, I don&#39;t have all the answers, and never said as much. I invite<br/>
&gt;speculation so long as it&#39;s colored that way, and not masked as truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s disappointing to have been mischaracterized and slandered by people<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being told not to promote our guild in this forum, and then seeing people<br/>
&gt;recruit forum members for a newly forming guild. So long as we&#39;re publicly<br/>
&gt;slandered, you can expect us to try and give an explanation or correction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone said they want a better guild guild than ours that helps people,<br/>
&gt;travels and adventures. Too bad this person has never been to our web site<br/>
&gt;and read about us. Instead, they choose to slander us. I would love to meet<br/>
&gt;you and show you all we hold dear. You&#39;d find that not only do we fit what<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re describing, but we also are encouraging each other as we write<br/>
&gt;ballads and history about Norrath and it&#39;s inhabitants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would boldly say that the Soerbaird value truth. I stand by my previous<br/>
&gt;implications that spreading false information is dishonorable and selfish.<br/>
&gt;We do expect people to speak intelligently. If this is to be seen as<br/>
&gt;arrogant, then so be it. But I ask you - if your life depended on it, would<br/>
&gt;you rather ask someone who told you, &quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;second right in Highpass&quot; or, &quot;Just take the second right in Highpass and<br/>
&gt;run for the exit&quot; - without knowing if this were true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have met many young ones running quests for hours that weren&#39;t right, but<br/>
&gt;adamantly defended by the unknowing. It&#39;s this thing I hope to see<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;It deeply hurts to be called arrogant, snobbish, ego-centric, and someone<br/>
&gt;even quoted me as saying:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You all are idiots, shut up if you don&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I happen to know the right answers, but I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow, how sad someone reads such despite out of nothing. Please consider<br/>
&gt;meeting me, or any of the Soerbaird for a truthful assessment of what we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;like.<br/>
