&gt;was the target of choice was when I pulled or had to charm a mob off<br/>
&gt;someone.  Even with our high taunt factor, the songs I was singing weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;effective enough to warrant more attention from the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>umm, i always thought it was a good thing when i didn&#39;t get attention from the mobs.<br/>

&gt;without being able to use my hard hitting songs I won&#39;t be an offensive<br/>
&gt;force when the &#39;chanter is around until I have three Chants.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you don&#39;t need to be an offensive force to contribute to the group.<br/>

&gt;have the tools to do that job anyhow except vs. casters.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, that is a large part of a bard&#39;s nature.  at level 51, i am almost purely<br/>
a defensive presence with 2 heal songs and Verses of Victory and the occasional<br/>
crowd control<br/>

&gt;weak considering we are fighting 1 mob 90% of the time.<br/>
