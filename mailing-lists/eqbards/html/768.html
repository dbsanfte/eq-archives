&gt;This is a matter of opinion really, since both ways are simple, if you<br/>
&gt;know the route, and both ways will kill you unexpectedly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The choice is up to you, but I recommend Beholder and Runnyeye, it has<br/>
&gt;much more room for a bard to maneuver.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with John, having explored both areas.  Highpass is easy IF<br/>
you have invisibility, without it, you&#39;re a bullseye waiting to be hit.  In<br/>
Runnyeye, you can darn near outrun anything.  Another suggestion when<br/>
heading form running from Runnyeye to Qeynos would be to wait on the<br/>
Runnyeye side for the usual party of adventurers to lure something big from<br/>
the left-hand gorge.  This will usually drag a small train of the biggest<br/>
pains (minos and/or muddites) leaving you a fairly clear path for at least<br/>
half the run.  After that, it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t get hit&quot; and you&#39;re fine.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I believe that SoW and Accelerando were initially intended to<br/>
be equal, however, Bardic spells increase in power over time, whereas most<br/>
spells do not.<br/>
