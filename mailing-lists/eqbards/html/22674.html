<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-879693381">If a 50 point slap hits a 45 point shield then 5 points would bleed<br/>
through. The up side it seems is that 45 max is for sung, some people<br/>
are getting upwards of 95 rune per 3 second pulse (with K-lute). What I<br/>
can&#39;t understand is why people think it&#39;s crap. *boggle* It doesn&#39;t<br/>
stack with Niv&#39;s, is this really such a problem? It&#39;s all defense,<br/>
Niv&#39;s is balance, there&#39;s a time and place for all things. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about Cantata strategies (not that I&#39;ll break 51 much less get<br/>
that high), does Hymn stack with Cantata? If so then Cantata + Hymn +<br/>
Shielding sounds like a damn fine backup healer position. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just playing my bard wrong *shrug*<br/>
