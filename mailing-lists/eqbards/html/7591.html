&gt; So by the time we kill the ghoul, I was down to about half<br/>
&gt; health, even though lullaby was working great. So everyone<br/>
&gt; gets on the tormented dead, thus waking it up, and it<br/>
&gt; remembers that it REALLY doesn&#39;t like me. Now I&#39;m at half<br/>
&gt; health and tanking a tormented dead full-time since he<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t sleep. Our druid heals me a few times but he is very<br/>
&gt; soon OOM due to burning the ghoul. The ranger healed me<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; course, the beetles not only totally hated me for putting<br/>
&gt; them to sleep, but they also were getting worked up cuz<br/>
&gt; they smelled a kill. And they got it, I was killed by a<br/>
&gt; green beetle. :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WHAT I LEARNED: Hmmm... I&#39;m not sure. I guess the idea<br/>
<br/>
When you play Lullaby, you will be doing most of the tanking<br/>
whether or not you want to.  Make sure the healer(s) in your<br/>
group are capable of healing all the damage you will take.  If<br/>
they can&#39;t, don&#39;t even bother trying to use it - just run for<br/>
the zone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll take you a while (and many deaths) to figure out just<br/>
what trains you can and can&#39;t handle with the song, but it&#39;s<br/>
well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; situation would have been to have the ghoul hitting on the<br/>
&gt; ranger, and the druid healing me while I slept the other<br/>
&gt; mobs. The only problem with that would be that this means<br/>
&gt; the ranger is basically soloing the ghoul... but I think<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to equip a lute to use the song, though it<br/>
helps.  You can equip your weapons and help with the fight.  <br/>
The ranger should&#39;ve taunted to try to get the ghoul off you,<br/>
thus taking some damage and saving the druid from having to<br/>
nuke so hard.  Whether or not the druid should&#39;ve helped with<br/>
the tormented or meditated back mana, I can&#39;t say since I<br/>
don&#39;t know much damage you were taking or now effective the<br/>
druid&#39;s heals were.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Accelerando is much faster with a drum.  Around level 20<br/>
I think, it becomes fast enough that you can walk faster than<br/>
most things can run.  Even before then, the extra speed can be<br/>
the difference between life and death.  If you ever find<br/>
yourself in a situation where you might have to run at less<br/>
than 33% health (the point where you start to move slower),<br/>
equip your drum as you&#39;re starting Accelerando.  I have pulled<br/>
friends with less than a quarter bubble of health and a half<br/>
dozen mobs on them from the house to the zone in Unrest simply<br/>
by using my drum.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; DEATH #3: So I go back to get my corpse, and as I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; looting some guy trains like four yard trash onto us,<br/>
&gt; which, for whatever reason, all frenzy on me and kill me<br/>
&gt; almost instantly. I still had almost a full bar of health<br/>
&gt; when I was looking down at my corpse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WHAT I LEARNED: Man, life sucks!<br/>
<br/>
When looting your body, the first thing you should loot is<br/>
your drum (pre-19) or your flute (19+).  Then you stop looting<br/>
(you can hit esc to do this quickly), start up Accelerando or<br/>
invisibility, and continue looting.<br/>
