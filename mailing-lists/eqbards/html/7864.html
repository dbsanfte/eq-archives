<b>Subject:</b> A trade skill question for the gallery. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337143857">I have recently begun working on my trade skills (tailoring, brewing,<br/>
and smithing...I&#39;m a bard, I should trade like one!) and have a<br/>
question about the new cured silk.  Is the triviality level the same<br/>
as raw silk/patchwork or is this something new to use instead of the<br/>
platinum eating studded armor?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is off topic, but this is the only place I have access to<br/>
ask at right now.<br/>
