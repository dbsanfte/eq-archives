&gt; Hey, what about the Claw?  (5/19)  I think it looks<br/>
&gt; much cooler than a sword, and I&#39;m thinking of dropping<br/>
&gt; my tommy to go with the better looking barbed leather<br/>
&gt; whip.  Also, the silvery war axe (in perma) looks<br/>
&gt; better than the PGT, and it&#39;s 6/22.  Your right<br/>
&gt; though, not a lot of good swords between 20 and 35.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as damage over time, I think the best weapons we can use until we<br/>
have a hope of getting the EBW or Ykesha, would be the claw in primary,<br/>
and one of the silvery weapons (6/22) in secondary. The 1H war axe seems<br/>
to be the easiest to get. I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a scimitar too but they<br/>
seem really rare.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem I have is that I think the claw/war axe combo looks pretty<br/>
bad. A much better look, IMHO, is a claw and dagger, and the best dagger<br/>
we can use is the venerable Dragoon Dirk, at 6/23.  These are basically<br/>
the best if you follow the fast delay is best theory. You can get an<br/>
Obsidian Shard (6/25) which also gives you the obsidian shatter effect<br/>
(30 pts) once and a while. With the depressing number of times we hit<br/>
for 1 and 2 pts it&#39;s nice to see that 30 pt proc occasionally so that&#39;s<br/>
what I&#39;ve settled on, the odd time I play my bard any more.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t follow the fast delay is best theory, some weapons you<br/>
could use would be the Crystalline Blade/Gladius combo, for a pair of<br/>
short swords. This looks ok, but is a slow combo and the gladius<br/>
certainly isn&#39;t the best weapon you can get by a long shot. A barbed<br/>
whip is one faster but wouldn&#39;t look as good. I don&#39;t know why all the<br/>
high end blades all seem to be short swords instead of long swords, but<br/>
it&#39;s probably just lazyness on the designer&#39;s part.<br/>
