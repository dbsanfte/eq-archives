<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492102968"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Yup, unless you started off at full mana, in which case you<br/>
&gt;&gt; automatically get the extra mana (at least, no white appeared<br/>
&gt;&gt; when I played Elegy at FM, whereas the white increased when<br/>
&gt;&gt; I played Elegy at less than FM).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I need to retest this to make sure this is what&#39;s going<br/>
&gt;on.  If this is really how it works, then once everyone is FM,<br/>
&gt;if you play Elegy, you&#39;ve essentially just given them free<br/>
&gt;mana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are documented screen-repainting bugs having to do with how<br/>
much mana you appear to have. I suspect this is another of those,<br/>
and that you do NOT get free mana.<br/>
