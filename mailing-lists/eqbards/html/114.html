<div id="ygrps-yiv-414059113">Try to use the message board for bards, not promoting your guild. So<br/>
one guy has a problem, and you can&#39;t please everybody. But try to help<br/>
bards out by tips, tactics and quest hints, not guild promotion. You<br/>
may be a good guild, I don&#39;t know, but please try to keep it<br/>
uncommercialized. Thankyou. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, any woodelf bard can give 4 spiderling silks to the guild<br/>
leader in kelethin and get a hand drum. This quest can be done over and<br/>
over and the drums can be sold for about 3-4 gold. Not to shabby for<br/>
newbies.<br/>
