<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074947556">Actually, I still find concord very useful in specific situations. <br/>
Dueling, for instance--nothing more annoying than having a caster nuke<br/>
and invis, rinse repeat.  But do I want to take the chance of switching<br/>
to my flute, in case they reappear?  Heck, no.  So I sing concord and<br/>
they are sitting ducks.<br/>
	I also found it very useful for CRs for humans--a couple of humans died<br/>
in a nasty train and by the time they returned it was pitch black and<br/>
they could not even see their corpses to loot.  So group up, kick on<br/>
concord and its lovely ultravision component and you have a couple very<br/>
grateful humans.<br/>
	I can think of a few other situations where the see invis *or*<br/>
ultravision could be equally useful, so I am not willing to write this<br/>
song off quite yet.<br/>
