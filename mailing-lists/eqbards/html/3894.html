<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135502711">Hi,<br/>
I have been a _long_ time lurker here, and must say that I have greatly<br/>
enjoyed the information and ideas exchanged  here.<br/>
I am glad that it seems the Druid, EQ&lt;-&gt;UO rant and trade skills stuff have<br/>
died out  - There is plenty of that kind of bitching going on everywhere<br/>
else... So back to the topic (and excuse me if this post have allready been<br/>
replied to, but Im reciving in digest form).<br/>
I am pretty sure that you DO move slower in different kinds of envoriment,<br/>
just try moving on to the sand in east commons or the ice (frozen rivers)<br/>
in Everfrost the sand will slow you down and the ice will have a slippery<br/>
feel to it?<br/>
So from my experince its not zones that are slower but the materials you<br/>
run on, makes sence in my oppion. Ohh and you seem to loose vigor faster<br/>
too when running/walking in high snow or sand.<br/>

Another point worth repeating here - it SEEMS that Selo&#39;s is slower in<br/>
certain zones - and I wondered about that for a long time until someone<br/>
here<br/>
mentioned (my apologies I forget whom) that the textures in different zones<br/>
cause movement to appear differently and hence you SEEM to be going<br/>
slower...<br/>
<br/>
As they say - appearances can be deceiving..<br/>

&gt; This is something I&#39;ve also noticed, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Verant<br/>
purposely<br/>
&gt; slowing us down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it has more to do with lag, and number of users in a zone. I know<br/>
&gt; when I am in a zone with few players, I zip over hills and dunes as<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; I were flying a Snowspeeder from Empire Strikes Back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the minute I hit a zone with 90+ people in it, it sure does seem like<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s loses some of it&#39;s gas.<br/>
