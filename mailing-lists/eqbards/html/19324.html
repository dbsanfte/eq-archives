<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839970469">I have been a programmer for years.  Obviously some of you have as well.  You&#39;re over-analyzing this though.  All they&#39;d have to do is add one flag to the client and one check to the drop process.  All in all roughly 4 lines of code to do it clunky.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Flag on client<br/>
<br/>
Add Flag<br/>
<br/>
CanDropItems = Binary<br/>
<br/>
Add code to drop check<br/>
<br/>
When clicking in view area<br/>
If Isareaempty = no then opentradewindow<br/>
Else<br/>
If CanDropItems = No then keepitemonmouse<br/>
Else<br/>
Drop Item<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the most elegant pseudocode but it should get the idea across.  Sure I may not have their exact process down but this would be a VERY easy patch to put in regardless of how they have it coded.  Even if the hook isn&#39;t already there it&#39;s 1 flag easily added to the engine.   It&#39;s not a major change to how the engine works.  They added the Destroy box in a 40kb patch during beta and I guarantee that wasn&#39;t in the client then.  <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Gordon has stated on at least 2 occasions that I can recall that they have something like this on the &quot;list&quot; but it&#39;s not high priority.<br/>
