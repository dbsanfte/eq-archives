<div id="ygrps-yiv-668330346">Fellow Historians of Norrath, Well met!<br/>
<br/>
i have a most unusual tale to tell today of my adventures in the<br/>
commonlands..<br/>
<br/>
As i went out to seek adventure (as well as fortune) in the commonlands, i<br/>
was hunting giant spiders in the eastern commonlands, for their valuable<br/>
silks, and venom sacs that the rogue&#39;s seem to have some use for ;) as i<br/>
began hunting, i noticed there were more hunters out here than game! every<br/>
spider, bear, beetle or lion i saw was in the process of being killed by a<br/>
hunting party! so i wandered off in search of game in less crowded areas.<br/>
<br/>
I headed west, and soon i was in the most dangerous area of the commonlands,<br/>
known simply as West Commonlands. i saw plenty of spiders, killed quite a<br/>
few, and then i noticed there were hill giants and griffins everywhere! i<br/>
ran seeking cover at the nearest inn, only, upon my approach, to see a hill<br/>
giant walk RIGHT ON TOP of it.. i bet the owners were not pleased..then i<br/>
saw a small guardpost along the path , with two Freeport militia men at it,<br/>
both fighting off fierce kodiaks and dangerous darkweed snakes. I hailed one<br/>
of the men, his name was Valon, and he demanded i pay a toll to use the<br/>
path! being a poor bard, i responded &quot;good Sirs, i cannot afford this toll,<br/>
let me pay you in song instead !&quot; , and in response, they stared at me<br/>
blankly. their lack of appreciation made me grow angry, for i am a very<br/>
accomplished musician, and so i said &quot;And what nerve you have charging a<br/>
toll for this road? do you own it? its not in the freeport municipal area..<br/>
you have no right to charge for passage! NO ! i will not pay! throw me in<br/>
jail if you must, but i will not submit to extortion such as this!&quot; and this<br/>
time they did not respond with a blank stare, but with a swift and brutal<br/>
pummeling.. when i awoke, i was lying outside the freeport gates, with all<br/>
my belongings taken from me!<br/>
<br/>
The lesson I learned today was that the enemy is not always who it seems...</div>
