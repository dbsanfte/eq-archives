<div id="ygrps-yiv-912572258">My guild can&#39;t do Vox or Naggy straight up because almost all of us are above level 52.  I&#39;m curious if<br/>
anyone can give me some guidance on how level 53+ characters can contribute to a Vox/Naggy raid without<br/>
being tossed (or with being tossed, if that&#39;s useful).  I don&#39;t understand the mechanics of when someone<br/>
is tossed and when they aren&#39;t.  We have a couple of small guild allies that we could use as front men.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone have links to any good information on taking down the Kunark dragons?  We haven&#39;t done<br/>
any of them yet; everyone keeps saying we have too few high levels (50 over level 53 doesn&#39;t seem that<br/>
weak to me, but what do I know?  We have about 5 level 60s now.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m never getting this epic weapon, we have too many warriors, and two Bards in front of me.  But it&#39;s<br/>
nice to dream.<br/>

&gt; went in. It&#39;s pretty damn sweet, and moreso now that it acts as a universal<br/>
&gt; instrument. He tested it on different songs and found that it is<br/>
&gt; substantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d drums or kelin&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lute, but it still amplifies pretty well. I&#39;m sure someone will post some<br/>
&gt; stats on how it stacks up verses our normal instruments.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS. We&#39;ve been killing Vox<br/>
&gt; weekly, but she has not been very generous with scales. If you want to see a<br/>
&gt; CRAP loot load, you should have been present yesterday when ALL she dropped<br/>
&gt; was 4 frozen paladin books. Today she dropped 2 RBB&#39;s, a bracer, and a<br/>
&gt; crystal spear so she kinda made up for that faux pax, but STILL NO<br/>
&gt; SCALES...grr...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well. If Shada or anyone else with an SSS posts some instrument-tests I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure we&#39;d all be curious to see how it does. =P<br/>
