<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188250524">Lol.  I&#39;ll never forget the first time my players in Rolemaster decided to<br/>
jump the bandits that had gotten the drop on them with bows.  The players<br/>
were all used to D&D where the pitiful damage from an arrow would never<br/>
deter you from charging the guy pointing it at you.  Nearly the entire party<br/>
was massacred.  I think Rolemaster is one of the most realistic systems out<br/>
there, but playing it without the aid of a computer to do all the modifiers<br/>
and chart lookups is too cumbersome.<br/>

I think the real reason their combat system differed from ICE&#39;s Rolemaster<br/>
is you practically need a phd in mathermatics to decipher Rolemaster.  We<br/>
have tried to play it several times, but usually spend two weeks making<br/>
characters only to have them die in the first fight.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have to look up a table called :<br/>
Racial Soul Departure Modifier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not kidding...<br/>
