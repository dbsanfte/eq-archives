I think your testing was flawed.<br/>
<br/>
Higher AC provides better damage absorption.  Cloth and Bronze would protect<br/>
just as well if they had the same AC value.  This has been confirmed<br/>
publicly by Verant.<br/>
<br/>
You tested Banded and Bronze and Crafted.  For each test your AC was higher<br/>
than before.  That&#39;s why you took less damage.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Coming from a level 45 warrior here, I can say that the type of armor does<br/>
&gt; make a difference. No cold hard facts, but I did do some tests one night<br/>
&gt; when we were bored. Loaded up my packs with different armors and we hit<br/>
&gt; lower guk. We choose the Crusader as our guinea pig. For those that don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know, he hits a lot for 120s. First, I loaded on the banded. 120s were<br/>
&gt; common place, and average hits were around 80 to 90 a pop. Shredded in<br/>

&gt; &gt;portion of the blow.  For example, the random generator decides you will<br/>

&gt; &gt;this:<br/>

&gt; &gt;Bronze 35<br/>
&gt; &gt;Steel 30<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just made these up as an example.  Another theory is that the type of<br/>
&gt; &gt;armor has no impact whatsoever.  In this case, the only thing that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;important is your AC.  A higher AC would mean a less chance of getting<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;If you do get hit, using the previous example, you would take 50 damage<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you were wearing steel plate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have no idea what the correct answer is but since I have enough STR to<br/>
&gt; &gt;wear full bronze, its a moot point for me.  I would like to get<br/>
&gt; confirmation<br/>
&gt; &gt;but doubt it will ever happen.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If I have a problem/complaint/suggestion for<br/>

&gt; &gt; about sending it to them (where are they most<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The best way if it&#39;s not a serious complaint, is with<br/>
&gt; the /feedback command. If it&#39;s a game bug complaint,<br/>
&gt; then use the /bug command. If it&#39;s about another<br/>
&gt; player on the server use the /petition command to get<br/>
&gt; the assistance of a guide. Otherwise, if you want to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quantified:  Charms the target turning it into your pet for<br/>
&gt; anywhere from<br/>
&gt; 0 to about 15 seconds.  Using a wind instrument has an<br/>
&gt; unknown effect, if<br/>
&gt; any.  High charisma is supposed to help with success rate<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although the same thought has crossed my mind many times, I think having<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; &gt; limited like this is part of Verant&#39;s balance plan.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to see some more bard-oriented quests for mid-high levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like the vengeful corpse quest in Halas - but more specifically bardic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would disagree.  While I would love class specific quests (and weapons,<br/>
&gt; armor, etc...) we have to realize that Verant has limited resources.  If<br/>
&gt; Verant had the time to add 50 new class specific quests, I could only do<br/>
&gt; four of them.  I&#39;d rather have access to more quests than fewer<br/>
&gt; class-specific quests.<br/>

&gt; &gt;My understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze<br/>
&gt; &gt;were the elite guards at the back by the diplomat. At L19 I would have<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Is this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>
&gt; &gt;my 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>
&gt; &gt;a crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: New friends in the forest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>
&gt; &gt;song, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;For 30-50pts each.  That was a new and frighting<br/>
&gt; &gt;experiance.  I&#39;m hoping it was a bug.  Zoned out with<br/>
&gt; &gt;half a bubble and a racing heart.  Anyone else take on<br/>
&gt; &gt;these little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt;now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, to confirm your nightmare, it&#39;s no bug.<br/>
&gt; I have been testing the skills of these shadowmen for the<br/>
&gt; past few days.  Level 35 + MM drum, and they still overtook<br/>
&gt; me, which absolutely confirms these creatures have SoN on.<br/>
&gt; (since I&#39;m faster than SoC now).  However, you as a *bard*<br/>
&gt; have a defense, that no others have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me and a level 36 druid decided to check these little guys out.<br/>
&gt; I got them on track in South Karana and headed over that way.<br/>
&gt; They are invisible until you are almost on top of them, at which<br/>
&gt; point you can see their name tags.  At level 35, two of the six<br/>
&gt; conn&#39;d high green, then others all blue.  High green at level 35<br/>
&gt; is equivalent to level 25.  My guess is these shadowmen are minimum<br/>
&gt; level 25 and range up to level 30 tops.  (that is just a guess btw)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we carefully scope them out, all warriors it seems.  And then<br/>
&gt; we get a little braver, and approach them.  They scowl, ready to<br/>
&gt; attack -- but do no such thing.  They are not aggressive.  The<br/>
&gt; druid attempts to pull one from the crowd, and I stand ready to<br/>
&gt; assist.  Instantly, all six shadowmen are on him... and he is<br/>
&gt; steadily losing life, decides to personal gate, and eventually<br/>
&gt; makes it.  I was stunned at what happened, but due to bard hate<br/>
&gt; I was instantly swarmed...  40 dmg, 50 dmg, double attacks.  ugh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Screw this, I&#39;m outta here -- see ya fools!   &#39;click&#39; Accelerando.<br/>
&gt; DOH!  Shit, the druid SOW&#39;d me!  &lt;sob, sob&gt;  (later to find out<br/>
&gt; I couldnt outrun them anyway)  I was about to pull a Plane of Fear<br/>
&gt; manuveur:  Find a safe, easy to locate spot and curl up to die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not today, fellow bards =)   Brass Horn to melee slot 2, &#39;click&#39;<br/>
&gt; Screech.  Six shadowmen vanish in terror...  /shout shadowmen to<br/>
&gt; bridge!  I make a run for it.  A few seconds later, the are on<br/>
&gt; me again, damn they are fast.   2 or 3 flee, &lt;laugh&gt;  and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; still making a run for the bridge...  A few more return, only<br/>
&gt; to be scared away by my pitiful brass skills.  I almost reach<br/>
&gt; the bridge, and everything is calm.  They didn&#39;t follow me any<br/>
&gt; further.  I speculate that since I had SOW and I was fearing them<br/>
&gt; in the opposite direction, that we were spanning the zone at<br/>
&gt; tremendous speeds, thus a time was reached when I exited their<br/>
&gt; chase radius and they returned home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MotS:  Screech, never leave home without it.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Rules and FAQ 1.1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There have been some changes to the instrument section.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list<br/>
&gt; dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>
&gt; This list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>needed.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If you have any suggestions, or any<br/>
&gt; frequently asked questions, please let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, some basic rules:<br/>
&gt; (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do often stray off the<br/>
&gt; path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards<br/>
&gt; have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Discussions of<br/>
&gt; Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil<br/>
&gt; someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space<br/>
&gt; (several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>
&gt;   Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so will be<br/>
&gt; immediately reviewed<br/>
&gt; for warning, removal or banning.<br/>
&gt;   On a related note, if you notice that your topic is straying from the<br/>
&gt; original thread, please change the subject header.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; Battle Drums becomes:<br/>
&gt; re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums)<br/>
&gt; For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can make an attempt<br/>
&gt; to change the subject field to something appropriate, that would help<br/>
 </span></blockquote>those<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>
&gt; be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>
&gt; make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST<br/>
 </span></blockquote>insult,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is<br/>
&gt; being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has<br/>
&gt; degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or<br/>
&gt; when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>
&gt; Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your latest picture,<br/>
&gt; some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link<br/>
 </span></blockquote>within<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have no access to such,<br/>
&gt; email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and<br/>
&gt; follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions will probably be<br/>
&gt; overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who<br/>
&gt; have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; try not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you should<br/>
&gt; always make sure that the message you are sending is properly referenced,<br/>
&gt; so that people reading the messages out of order are not completely lost.<br/>
&gt; And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>
&gt; incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much more effective,<br/>
&gt; and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use spoiler headings<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and/or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;FBR&quot; - What<br/>
&gt; do they all mean?!<br/>
&gt; A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless plug).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Briefly,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do<br/>
&gt; damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at once), &quot;Direct<br/>
&gt; Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their damage at once),<br/>
&gt; &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon, and &quot;Flowing Black Robes&quot;<br/>
&gt; something casters love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this song do?<br/>
&gt; A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s Guild<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of spellsongs,<br/>
&gt; however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let me refer<br/>
&gt; you to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/</a> - The Concert Hall.  Also,<br/>
&gt; the Soerbaird is a wonderful site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>
&gt; (Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
&gt; A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this instrument will<br/>
&gt; generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related to<br/>
&gt; your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, instrument skill is<br/>
&gt; partially responsible for failure rate of related songs.  To avoid<br/>
&gt; &quot;fizzling&quot; (missing notes) even when singing, keep your instrument skills<br/>
&gt; maxed out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
&gt; A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>
&gt;      The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), which increases the<br/>
&gt; effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>
&gt;      The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which has no<br/>
&gt; discernible special effect.<br/>
&gt;      Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) which has no known<br/>
&gt; discernible effect.<br/>
&gt;      Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which increases the<br/>
&gt; effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>
&gt;      McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 CHA<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>
&gt;      Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of King<br/>
&gt; Grobb are wind instruments with no known special effect.  They are,<br/>
&gt; however, lighter than flutes, and don&#39;t cause that awful animation.<br/>
&gt;      The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be non-magical wind<br/>
&gt; instruments, but this still remains to be proven.<br/>
&gt;      The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as a Greater<br/>
&gt; Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument.  Other than that, it<br/>
&gt; has no discernible special effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>
&gt; A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while<br/>
&gt; swinging a sword?<br/>
&gt; A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand only items, they are<br/>
&gt; also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash<br/>
&gt; monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level?  Where should<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hunt at this level?<br/>
&gt; A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
&gt; A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6<br/>
 </span></blockquote>empty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>
&gt; box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>

&gt; create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it<br/>
&gt; down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself<br/>
&gt; to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey<br/>
&gt; slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated<br/>
&gt; hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.<br/>
&gt; Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is<br/>
&gt; simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
&gt; A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>
&gt; inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>into<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>
&gt; MANEUVER.  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and<br/>
&gt; more likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do*<br/>
&gt; accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>
&gt; run like crazy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>
&gt; A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This<br/>
&gt; means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield,<br/>
&gt; pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of<br/>
&gt; them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and<br/>
&gt; Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these<br/>
&gt; skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration<br/>
&gt; speed for your party members?<br/>
&gt; A: No.  What the Jig does is increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration<br/>
&gt; every six seconds and hence the display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana<br/>
&gt; bars to show this increase.  Without the song playing the bars are<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; moving FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the distance it would<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a piece of virtual duct-tape to allow GMs and Guides to play Bards and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>
&gt; A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I<br/>
&gt; will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will<br/>
&gt; eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and<br/>
&gt; jewelry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of ideas.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the<br/>
&gt; list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end up getting it<br/>
&gt; posted twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fellow bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>
&gt; In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>petition<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song<br/>
&gt; currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>
&gt; identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations<br/>

&gt; attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>
&gt; the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>song.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>
&gt; it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new<br/>
&gt; song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>minor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new<br/>
 </span></blockquote>song<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone<br/>
&gt; submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be.<br/>
&gt; Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>
&gt; have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>
&gt; to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; vote on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
&gt; power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>toned<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>
&gt; amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>
&gt; instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>
&gt; song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>
&gt; Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>
&gt; level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you<br/>
&gt; can try it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>
&gt; bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>
&gt; mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>
&gt; someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>
&gt; one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>
&gt; thats what everyone wants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these<br/>
&gt; that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday<br/>

&gt;      Gentle Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I agree with your idea in theory but not on your choice of song to<br/>
&gt;      replace.  Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that<br/>
&gt;      had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my<br/>
&gt;      surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item<br/>
&gt;      that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the<br/>
&gt;      song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I<br/>
&gt;      finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will<br/>
&gt;      finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is still not a real<br/>
&gt;      heavyweight but it actually works now and more importantly Verant is<br/>
&gt;      actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.<br/>
&gt;      Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      your suggestions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I<br/>
&gt;      certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      5.  see 3 above<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts like the<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I for one like the level 14 song.  As more and more lore items are<br/>
&gt; appearing, this song is becoming more and more useful.  Ever find a lore<br/>
&gt; item and have no idea what quest its for?  This song will often give you a<br/>
&gt; hint.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me also respond to your suggestions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>
&gt; toned<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want the combined power of these songs, why don&#39;t you just twist<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; together?  Or are you saying that you&#39;ll like the equivelent of being able<br/>
&gt; to play an extra song at the same time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you<br/>
&gt; sing<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An agility song already exists.  It combines around 15 or 20 agility with<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; approximate 20-25% attack speed increase.  Level 36 if I recall.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;can try it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This will never happen.  This is like a warrior asking to have the gate<br/>
&gt; spell.  We already run faster than anyone else.  To expect this would just<br/>
&gt; be silly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The level 26 charm spell is IMHO the most effective technique in the game<br/>
&gt; for pulling a mob off a caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think<br/>

&gt; If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>
&gt; covered:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>
&gt; 2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>
&gt; 3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>
&gt; the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>
&gt; 4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt; monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>
&gt; 5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>
&gt; (i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>
&gt; 6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>
&gt; 7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry if this sounds a little harsh, but I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing<br/>
&gt; petition after petition saying &quot;my monk should get bind&quot; or &quot;my wizard<br/>
&gt; should be able to wear plate armor&quot;.  In my opinion, Bards are the most<br/>
&gt; versitile class in the game, and the most fun to play.  We have more<br/>
&gt; abilities than anyone else, and we get to use one of the widest ranges of<br/>
&gt; equipment in the game.  Please stop trying to make this class into<br/>

&gt;      Gentle Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I agree with your idea in theory but not on your choice of song to<br/>
&gt;      replace.  Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that<br/>
&gt;      had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my<br/>
&gt;      surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item<br/>
&gt;      that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the<br/>
&gt;      song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I<br/>
&gt;      finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will<br/>
&gt;      finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is still not a real<br/>
&gt;      heavyweight but it actually works now and more importantly Verant is<br/>
&gt;      actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.<br/>
&gt;      Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      your suggestions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I<br/>
&gt;      certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      5.  see 3 above<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts like the<br/>

&gt; I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the<br/>

&gt; posted twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fellow bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>
&gt; In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>petition<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song<br/>
&gt; currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is<br/>
&gt; sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>
&gt; attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>
&gt; the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>song.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>
&gt; it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new<br/>
&gt; song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think<br/>

&gt; submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be.<br/>
&gt; Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>
&gt; have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>
&gt; to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order<br/>
