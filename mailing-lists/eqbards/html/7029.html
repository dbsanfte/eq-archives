<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893030005"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
&gt; only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>
&gt; likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
&gt; thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>
&gt; deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
&gt; as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are correct, but I prefer to stick by the average.  I&#39;m sure the game was<br/>
designed with typical bell curve plots for damage.  One side of the bell curve<br/>
being extremely &quot;bad rolls&quot; and low damage over the course of a fight, and the<br/>
other side being one of those fights where you ask your groupmates to scroll<br/>
back and &quot;look at all that damage I did and how many times my weapon proced!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We all know from personal experience that being on the low end of that curve<br/>
gets ya killed or sends you fleeing.  No question.  Everyone has had to flee<br/>
many a fight that they should have won due to a run of bad rolls (misses).<br/>
This is *less* likely to occur if you stick to the center of the bell curve<br/>
with your weapons and choose medium/fast weapons with medium/light damage.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, everyone knows that when their warrior picks up a Thulian<br/>
Bladed Claw (5dam/19dly) they&#39;re hitting fast and light, with probably<br/>
unspectacular (average) results.  However, when they pick up a Blackened Iron<br/>
Bastard Sword (BIBS at 20dam/47dly) they&#39;re GAMBLING.  Anyone who has played<br/>
with a slow, high damage weapon knows what it&#39;s like to be playing saying<br/>
&quot;gimmie a hit, gimmie a hit, gimmie a hit&quot;.  The importance of hitting each<br/>
and every time is greatly increased with slower weapons.  When I play with my<br/>
Claws, I hardly even notice the misses, and by the time I do I&#39;m having the<br/>
chance to hit again.<br/>
