<div id="ygrps-yiv-648738108">Ok, to respond to a couple of different posts simultaneously:<br/>
<br/>
I realize that no one is really arguing with me, but this discussion started<br/>
because of the Shaman saying he could melee a blue at level 35, remember?<br/>
So I was talking about purely meleeing down a solid blue mob.  No charming<br/>
or pixie strking, etc.  Our buffing songs don&#39;t count since a shaman would<br/>
have been buffed meleeing down a blue too.<br/>
<br/>
Technically John&#39;s experience in Sol B is with soloing a &quot;light blue&quot; mob ~5<br/>
levels below him.  Although it&#39;s very hard to apply the term &quot;light blue&quot; to<br/>
the GKs in Sol B with a straight face.  I&#39;ve fought my fair share of them<br/>
and they&#39;ll put the hurt on you quickly when you get their attention.<br/>

Crier Sharpsong - 32nd on Fennin Ro<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At 32nd with maxed 1HB and maxed 1HS, a Staff of Writhing and a<br/>
&gt; Silvery War<br/>
&gt; &gt; Axe I can kill a light blue if nothing abnormal happens and he&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster.  Taking on a blue or deep blue would be tantamount to<br/>
&gt; suicide, at<br/>
&gt; &gt; best very, very risky.  For me a solid blue mob would be a<br/>
&gt; Lizard Fanatic in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cazic-Thule.  It would pound me into the mud one-on-one.  No<br/>
&gt; question.  On<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other hand, a light blue would be a gator in the sewers.  I<br/>
&gt; *can* solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of those.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just for yucks, I decided to try soloing a greater kobold in<br/>
&gt; Sol B (usually L35 or so) at level 40.  I played Hymn,<br/>
&gt; Warsong, Psalm of Cooling, and Chain, trying as hard as I<br/>
&gt; could to keep all 4 effects going (probably succeeded about<br/>
&gt; half the time).  When I dropped below half health, I switched<br/>
&gt; to Pixie Strike/Hymn with a lute while I healed up.  I did<br/>
&gt; this right in front of a little-used zone line for reasons of<br/>
&gt; safety.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It started off pretty well.  I amazed myself by dropping it<br/>
&gt; about 20% (one bubble) while only taking one bubble of damage<br/>
&gt; myself.  Then it got several quick hits in dropping me below<br/>
&gt; half, and I switched to heal up while it was down 30%.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next round didn&#39;t go very well.  It got some big hits on me<br/>
&gt; and I was down 3 bubbles before I barely budged its hp - maybe<br/>
&gt; 10%, leaving it down about 35% (it healed too while I was<br/>
&gt; healing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next two rounds were about average - I chipped off about<br/>
&gt; 20% of its hp before it could drop me to below half.  So after<br/>
&gt; four rounds, the kobold was down 70% or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The fifth round had a close call as another kobold spawned in<br/>
&gt; the room (I was in the hall).  Fortunately, it was just out of<br/>
&gt; aggro range and didn&#39;t join.  Another player watched me for a<br/>
&gt; bit, then pulled the new kobold.  I was smelling blood by the<br/>
&gt; end of this round with the kobold down to about 15% of its hp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The sixth round I almost killed it, getting it down to just a<br/>
&gt; sliver of hp, maybe 5%, while I was at half.  I decided to<br/>
&gt; commit to killing it this round, since the zone was just<br/>
&gt; behind me.  I was starting to regret my decision when it got<br/>
&gt; several lucky hits on me leaving me with little more than a<br/>
&gt; bubble, when the other player returned and tossed a couple<br/>
&gt; heals on me.  The kobold started to run once I was healed, and<br/>
&gt; after 20 minutes fighting the same kobold, I got to loot my<br/>
&gt; kill.  Final score:  me - about 6 bubbles damage, kobold -<br/>
&gt; about 17 bubbles of damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So yeah, you can solo, but you probably don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; much easier to group or charm (I suppose charm could be<br/>
&gt; considered soloing, but killing off the winner solo can be a<br/>
&gt; pain too).<br/>
