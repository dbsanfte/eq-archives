<div id="ygrps-yiv-511465808">I use Win2k for gaming...I&#39;ve had very few problems with my system (most&#39;ve the problems that I have had were fixed by installing new drivers).  I used to use Win98, but I think 2k has much better memory and CPU management...my games seem to run better and I have fewer lockups and problems then I used to.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a few friends though that have had problems with 2k...if you have good hardware with good 2k drivers, then it should work fine.<br/>

which do you feel is better (for gaming): Win2k, WinME, or Win98?<br/>
