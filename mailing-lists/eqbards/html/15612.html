<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316628850">One thing I always thought was strange.  Why didn&#39;t Verant make corpse<br/>
dragging dependent on a different permission than looting?  Adding a /drag<br/>
permission to the game wouldn&#39;t be all that difficult, then they could<br/>
enable people to drag a corpse without being able to loot it.  If that&#39;s too<br/>
&#39;unrealistic&#39; for them, why not do the following:  <br/>
/trust allows someone else to drag and loot your corpse.<br/>
/consent allows someone to drag and loot your corpse without suffering<br/>
penalties<br/>
<br/>
Add in a penalty that every item you loot off a PC corpse that you do not<br/>
have consent to gives you a major faction hit to that players race and<br/>
class.  This lets such things have in game consequences.  To further prevent<br/>
&#39;mule&#39; abuses, make some percentage of these faction modifications carry<br/>
over to the characters station id so that every character they play would<br/>
share in the responsibility for these anti-social actions.<br/>
