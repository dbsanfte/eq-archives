<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658738825"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Really?  When I watch myself in the third person, I seem to disappear <br/>
&gt; every single time.  Am I really Hiding?  Maybe I should ask the others<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m with to watch?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I must have a lame bard.  I bet it&#39;s because I worship Karana, and<br/>
  all those people are getting back at me since it rains all the time.<br/>
<br/>
  I cannot resist jack, I cannot hide, I cannot make my ID go up...<br/>
<br/>
  Gotta be the dice, sigh.<br/>

  PS&gt; I just target something before I Hide, if it goes to indifferent<br/>
      then everything is groovy.</div>
