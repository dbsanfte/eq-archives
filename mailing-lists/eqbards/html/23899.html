&gt;I see absolutely nothing in this patch that addresses EITHER of those<br/>
&gt;beliefs. Furthermore, assuming that my personal belief is incorrect, I see<br/>
&gt;nothing that does the opposite. Based on what I see in this patch, I have to<br/>
&gt;conclude that bards are perfect and all the other classes are being balanced<br/>
&gt;to match them, only I&#39;m not seeing any reduction of power in the other<br/>
&gt;classes post 50, in fact, I&#39;m seeing modest improvements for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bards are not really underpowered in the post 50 game imo.  they are<br/>
only underpowered on large multigroup raids.  why is this?  because<br/>
bards are best at being flexible and filling in the gaps of abilities not<br/>
represented in the group.  generally in most well organized large multigroup<br/>
raids, all abilities ARE represented, leaving little for the bard to do.<br/>
i would say that bards are overpowered in most single group scenarios<br/>
(even post 50) and underpowered in most multi group raids which seems<br/>
as a whole compared to other classes to be overpowered.  paladins/sks/<br/>
necros/druids/mages/rangers all are underpowered in the large raid type encounters.<br/>
but they also aren&#39;t any more powerful in single group scenarios or unbalanced<br/>
group scenarios either.  necros and druids are slightly compensated in that they<br/>
can solo well for most of their careers if they choose to.  but the other hybrids<br/>
seem to need some sort of enhancement.</div>
