<div id="ygrps-yiv-623357769">Follow up to this, Killed phinnie 2 times after that and got my spine<br/>
finally on the second one, which was about my 15th or so raid. Yesterday I<br/>
spent a good part of the day raising my gnome faction, I did not want to<br/>
charm the little bugger so I killed many many minotaurs and meldraths and am<br/>
now dubious to gemchoppers and warmly to kingakanon. Funny how you can kill<br/>
gnomes for months on end and then just kill minos for a day to be ok with<br/>
them. Tonight I multiquest the whip and I&#39;ll just need to spawn trak *joy*<br/>
<br/>
Question though, I picked up many weird items while in steamfont from<br/>
various areas<br/>
<br/>
Ground spawns: <br/>
8 or so Iron Oxide (was told they are dyes)<br/>
8 or so Russet oxides (was told they are dyes)<br/>
20 or so Moss covered drake scales<br/>
A dusty skull from meldrath&#39;s room, ground spawn, idents as something<br/>
lightforge&#39;s skull, no drop<br/>
Oh and 3 mino heros, now i have to figure out if im kos in qeynos from<br/>
killing beef and brian mcabee<br/>
encrypted document from a kobold missionary, idents as something of some zek<br/>
(sorry i forgot), also no drop.<br/>
<br/>
Any idea/insight on any of this stuff?<br/>

<br/>
  This weekend my guild decided to try out Naggy with alts on friday so we<br/>
  could get our hands on another rez stick afterwards.  we got him, he<br/>
dropped<br/>
  a CoF and 2 9/25 piercers. Then we waited for rage, and waited, and waited<br/>
  some more, finally on sunday Rage showed up, and dropped 3 red scales<br/>
woot.<br/>
  I log out afterwards cause had to go out of town for a few hours.  When I<br/>
  log in later, they&#39;re buffing up for Gore, so I got there asap and I got<br/>
my<br/>
  white scale from her!  I&#39;m in utter shock, got my 2 scales on the same<br/>
day,<br/>
  now its just a matter of time before phinny drops his spine for me. Just<br/>
  wanted to share my luck 8)<br/>
<br/>
  Minkin<br/>
  one very happy bard<br/>
  RIP<br/>
