&gt; What you described may be 100% true but I don&#39;t think it applies to what<br/>
&gt; happened to me.  Both times I died I was 30th level.  The experience loss<br/>
&gt; (i.e. visual amount the bar decreased) for getting killed by the green mob<br/>
&gt; was definately more than it was for dying to the red mob.  Still wondering<br/>
&gt; if other people have had similar results.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How much did you lose?  I&#39;ve seen the same thing in hell<br/>
levels, and I always figured it was due to roundoff error.  <br/>
e.g. Say I lose 2.5 pixels of exp per death.  First death I go<br/>
from 45.9 pixels to 43.4 pixels, or 45-&gt;43.  Second death I go<br/>
from 46.1 pixels to 43.6, or 46-&gt;43.  The second death looks<br/>
like I lost 50% more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also little visual tricks going on depending where<br/>
the exp bar is within a bubble - movement near the middle is<br/>
not as apparent as movement near the edges.  Movement in the<br/>
first and last bubbles can be completely masked when the end<br/>
of the exp bar is obscured by the little decoration.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be swayed by these theories unless someone<br/>
observes the effect in a level where you lose ~half a bubble<br/>
or more per death, and all the deaths in question happened at<br/>
abount the same point in exp (e.g. right after you gained a<br/>
pixel into the 3rd bubble).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw, you DO lose more exp in hell levels + 1.  It&#39;s not<br/>
the same exp loss appearing larger because HL+1 requires less<br/>
exp.  I died *immediately* after I got level 31, and lost over<br/>
a half bubble into 30.  I only lost about a quarter bubble<br/>
with other deaths at 30.<br/>
