<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695818587">When Verant does this I think they are going to limit the areas.  We will<br/>
not be able to be bound anywhere in a zone, only a small area.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think the bind points will be very close to the dungeons because that is<br/>
giving melee people the benefit that only casters have, and goes against<br/>
The Vision.<br/>
<br/>
Probably see bind points at:<br/>
Sol Ro Temple: for Sol A&B and Najena<br/>
Lake Rathe: for Paw<br/>
Feerott: for Cazic<br/>
Everfrost: for Permafrost, will also have to get a exp raise to attract people.<br/>
Overthere and FV: Probably be able to bind anywhere in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
None for:<br/>
Kedge: GFay and Kaladim are close.<br/>
Unrest, Mistmoor: These are already a well used zones, no changes.<br/>
Guk: No changes or bind points.  Guk is already over crowded and the loot<br/>
attracts people.<br/>
Blackburrow: No changes, Qeynos is close.<br/>
The Hole: Erudin and Paineel are too close.<br/>
Befallen: Fp is too close.<br/>
<br/>
Someone here already said the same thing I was thinking.  The problem with<br/>
Permafrost is not the bind area (for most people), but the long run from<br/>
the nearest teleport.  Either they have to put a teleport and evac in<br/>
Everfrost or give a huge exp raise to get people there.<br/>

&gt;Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
&gt;Ocean of Tears (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
