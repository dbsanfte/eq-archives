&gt;<br/>
&gt; I being a level 27 Bard probably use Bellow more than any other song as<br/>
&gt; that little extra dmg is great. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are 27th then you are using the wrong soings to solo. I am 29th,<br/>
and i solo all the time, and i NEVER use bellow. Just yesterday, i<br/>
solo&#39;d a Full size mammoth (blue) and a Werewolf (also blue). <br/>
<br/>
The way to solo at 27+ is chain/fear/heal. chain the mob so it can&#39;t<br/>
run, Fear it so i walks away, Whack it with your weapons, and heal<br/>
during the EXTRA pulse. Mamoths can hit for 100 points a round, so with<br/>
my HP, bellowing against it i would last about 6 rounds. With<br/>
Chain/fear/heal, i was able to solo it with about 50% hp left, probably<br/>
only that bad because my brass is not maxed, and i missed notes on fear<br/>
alot.</div>
