    Subject: [eqbards] Rubicite Armor<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I would like information on Rubicite Armor, where does each piece come from and how difficult are they to get?  I have seen many things on rubi armor but not the actual monsters that carries each one.<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
                              <br/>
    =======================================================================<br/>
    <br/>
    From Cazic Thule, land of the lounge leezards.....<br/>
    <br/>
    In the Throne Room, where leezards and monkies abound....<br/>
    <br/>
    A fella named &quot;Tae Templar&quot; ocassionally carries Rubicite armor, and sometimes a nice Leezardscale cloak.  His partner in crime, the &quot;Tae Diviner&quot; sometimes carries Rubicite Bracers (I am told), but usually carries the Leezardscale Mantle.<br/>
    <br/>
    I am told also that the Rubicite Boots and Helm are carried by a critter upstairs of the throneroom. I haven&#39;t dared venture that far yet...<br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, the Rubicite Breastplate, which supposedly insanely adds 10 points to ALL your stats, can be found on the Avatar of Fear (I&#39;ve been told). Amazignly enough, the Avatar is also the critter that sometimes drops the Demon Claw. I have not found out if he drops both at the same time or not. He is still just a wee bit high for my group. (Low 30&#39;s)<br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck! I&#39;ve seen Rubicite Greaves sell for almost 1000 plat, even though they aren&#39;t THAT much better than Plate Greaves.<br/>
