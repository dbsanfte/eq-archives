<div id="ygrps-yiv-452996850">**Technically, the below information could be loosely construed as a &quot;Spoiler&quot;,<br/>
but since Trade Skills have been spoiled for 10 months already, i don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone really cares 8)**<br/>

All the PvP recipies that are known to me at this time trivial out at 60<br/>
Baking.<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, the quickest way to get baking up is to (after getting some +int gear 8)<br/>
) is to do Batwing Crunchies (1 Batwing, 1 frosting [buy the Batwings at the<br/>
freeport mages guild, frosting purchaseable from Parthar in EC, amongst other<br/>
places...]) which trivials at 45..then do Fish Fillets (1 Fish, 1 Jug o&#39;<br/>
Sauces[from Parthar et al again]) which don&#39;t trivial until 84...from then it<br/>
is Fish Rolls until 130something (problee 135) (1 Batwing, 1 fish)...<br/>
<br/>
My baking is 130something(along with just about every other trade skill, sans<br/>
tailoring}..beyond that i think you have to do pies and such to get to<br/>
200...but anything over 60 is sufficient for the PvP recipies...Baking runs<br/>
along the lines of Brewing, where Trivial really is trivial, and you rarely<br/>
fail on the items below your skill level...<br/>

On a Side note, I have alot of fun with my magician [see above sig] when people<br/>
try to &quot;Pull&quot; me in mistmoore 8^P.  More accurately, when people try to figure<br/>
out why there is a Glyphed Aegis in Cazic Thule 8^).<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
