good doing it.  I wear blackened armor in all the<br/>
visible spots except the head where I have a woven<br/>
cap.  It&#39;s only AC2 but it&#39;s the best I have found<br/>
that is invisible (half-elf BTW).  I have heard a silk<br/>
turban from the named giant (Hettar I believe) in<br/>
Oasis is also invisible.<br/>
<br/>
I receive a large number of spontaneous compliments<br/>
and I revel in it.  *grin*<br/>
