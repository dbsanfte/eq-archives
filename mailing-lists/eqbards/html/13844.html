&gt; Well by reducing crowding, you do have the OPTION to dungeon crawl if<br/>
&gt; you want to take it.  This is pretty much what my group used to do in<br/>
&gt; Paw (since we were alone in there) and UpperGuk, since often the squire<br/>
&gt; is the only guy we can take who is camped...  It would be nice to have<br/>
&gt; that option in other dungeons as well.<br/>

I&#39;d consider being relegated to &quot;unpopular&quot; dungeons like the<br/>
old Paw, UGuk, and Permafrost as really having options.  We<br/>
did a lot of crawls in those, and even then most of the named<br/>
spawns were camped so we ended up with a bunch of mid-20s<br/>
characters with mid-teens equipment.<br/>
