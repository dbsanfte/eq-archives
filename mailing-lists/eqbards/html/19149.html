<b>Subject:</b> More than 6 in a group? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761525840">I just read the following on AllaKhazam&#39;s page...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is possible to have a group larger than 6 people that still shares<br/>
experience for a kill.  To do this start with a group of 5.  Then have<br/>
someone outside the group invite the other non party members to form their<br/>
own group.  They should hold off on accepting the invite (don&#39;t decline<br/>
either).  Then invite the person who just did that invite to join the first<br/>
group.  After he accepts, and is added to the group, the other people he<br/>
invited should accept his group invitation.  They will now be part of the<br/>
overall group, but will not appear on the main group&#39;s member list.  They<br/>
will share xp for the kills and can make (but not hear) group tells.  When a<br/>
party member above them leaves, they will move up onto the list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If this actually works, it would be entirely possible to have multiple<br/>
groups combining into one to participate in Vox and Nagafen raids and get<br/>
group experience.<br/>
<br/>
And to keep it on topic, how does one Bard buffing 20 people and providing<br/>
Clarity to a dozen mana-drained casters sound? :)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how long it&#39;ll take to be &#39;fixed&#39;.<br/>
