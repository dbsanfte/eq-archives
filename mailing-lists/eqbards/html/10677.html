<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995996225">At the risk of sounding like an old coot, you youngins today do not know how<br/>
<br/>
easy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>
And the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by <br/>
added.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220 plat <br/>
on a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the Dragoon <br/>
Dirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat, <br/>
aarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though :)<br/>

Hee hee, trouble is I&#39;m almost as mature as my server!  I started in late<br/>
April after all my friends forgot which server to start on and left me alone<br/>
on Sol Ro.  I was saving up for a WB rapier on the premise it like a combine<br/>
would be a rental fee.  Fortunately John (tm) saved me from my folly by<br/>
letting me know in advance it would sell back for so little.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
enough money in my day to buy a better 1HS, but spent it in halves or so on<br/>
armor that was so much better than what I had compared to moving up from a<br/>
dirk to an obsidian scimmy.  Maybe I should sell a couple of 150pp+ armor<br/>
pieces and replace them with bronze to buy an obsidian scimitar.  I&#39;d rather<br/>
earn it directly as that&#39;s how I got the two weapons I have now, but that<br/>
isn&#39;t possible at my level.  There are no good weapons dropped that a group<br/>
of my level could get that a bard can use that are better than my dirk.<br/>
Hmmm, maybe the dirk is the unbalanced part!<br/>
