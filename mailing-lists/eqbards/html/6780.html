<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128469197">There is a vendor in Qeynos that sells a silk evening shirt ( I think thats<br/>
what its called).  The item gives +5CHR.  I have had one for a long time and<br/>
equip it everytime I buy and sell stuff to vendors.  Imagine if these new<br/>
player made silk clothing items also gave a CHR bonus.  Just about every<br/>
player would have a full set just for buying/selling.  Probably a good idea<br/>
that Verant didn&#39;t include the CHR bonus.  It would be nice though for<br/>
newbie bards if they did.  I think I&#39;ll get a full set of silk anyway for<br/>
when I&#39;m trying to woo female wood elves at the Heartwood Tavern.<br/>

&gt; Greetings<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Around 8:00 pm est I was told by a Cleric named Archurian how to make<br/>
&gt; raw-silk armor. This is the first person I have heard of to make the armor<br/>
&gt; so I give credit to him =). Here is how to do it. You will need a large<br/>
&gt; sewing kit and a skill lvl of 20 (hehe this is real easy stuff to make)<br/>
&gt; and some spider silk. First you take spider silk (not spiderling silk you<br/>
&gt; need to get this silk from there full grown brothers). Now you take 2<br/>
&gt; spider silks and put it in your large sewing kit. Hit combine you will get<br/>
&gt; a silk swatch (this was trivial to me at skill lvl 25) now that you have<br/>
&gt; the silk swatch you take that and put it the large sewing kit with the<br/>
&gt; pattern of your choice. Hit combine and whalla. You get a raw-silk item =)<br/>
&gt; easy right? Tunic/Robes and pants take 2 swatches to make all others take<br/>
&gt; 1. The items can be worn by the pure magic classes and monks. due to there<br/>
&gt; low wt. they are good for both groups. They have one ac over cloth so they<br/>
&gt; are really only good for low to mid lvl. The robe that you make looks like<br/>
&gt; a light brown (like the thurm robe). None of the garments have any magic<br/>
&gt; stats on them. I have been charging about a plat for each garment and 2pp<br/>
&gt; for robe and pants.. I have been selling everything I make to hehe. Due to<br/>
&gt; the low lvl of skill needed to make the armor I don&#39;t think you can charge<br/>
&gt; much more then that. I would encourage each of you to tell as many people<br/>
&gt; as you can on how to make silk. I think that if we have a free flow of<br/>
&gt; information we will quickly be able to figure out what Verant made with<br/>
&gt; this patch =).<br/>
