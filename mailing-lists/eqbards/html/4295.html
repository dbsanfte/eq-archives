<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815676606">Ok here is the story.  No, you can not get the Wakizishi from this quest =(<br/>
It is in Mistmoore but has nothing to do with Arlena.  Lord Grimlot does<br/>
want you to bring back Arlena&#39;s bones and give them to him, what that does<br/>
who knows.  Lord Grimlot has two forms, an easy skeleton form, and a super<br/>
hard Human in full plate form, sometimes with Opal Scythe sometimes with<br/>
some type of good scimitar.  The way to get Lord Grimlot to spawn is to go<br/>
to the skeleton camp just outside the bridge in south karana.  gotta clear<br/>
the camp and hope he spawns at night.  we got him to spawn first night, and<br/>
had a dark elf necro talk to him, and got him to talk about his lost love,<br/>
but he wanted bones not lute.  myself and my bard friend didn&#39;t want to risk<br/>
losing our lutes (that do nothing, but you never know).  a level 50 druid<br/>
friend of mine took his level 25+ bard and went to Grimlot.  with his bard<br/>
he used his mask of the deceiver to become a dark elf and sang charismatic<br/>
carillon on Grimlot.  Grimlot was no longer KOS but was amiable i think, got<br/>
him to talk about the quest, and gave him the lute.  all Grimlot did was<br/>
equip the lute, so they had to kill him but was able to loot the lute<br/>
(hehe).<br/>
