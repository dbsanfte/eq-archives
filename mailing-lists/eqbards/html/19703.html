<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766851481">Someone posted a good idea on the Concert Hall about what effects the<br/>
Singing Steel armor should have.  The poster&#39;s idea what to some of the<br/>
pieces act as actual instruments.  His reasoning is that the name of the<br/>
armor is &quot;singing&quot; so it should increase the effectiveness of our songs.  So<br/>
for example the singing steel greaves would have String effect.  Singing a<br/>
string based song without a lute equipped but with the greaves on would have<br/>
the same effect as singing the song with a lute equipped.  And if you did<br/>
equip an instrument, you would get double the effect.  <br/>

What do you want to bet the other Singing Steel Pieces are not in the game<br/>
because they ran out of ideas for effects to give them?<br/>
<br/>
Too bad the rumour that all the melee and hybrid BP&#39;s had Gate, I was<br/>
looking forward to that.  I&#39;ve been playing my bard a whole lot more lately<br/>
and having fun, but there are still times when I play my casters solely due<br/>
to the inconveniences of being a melee class. ;-(<br/>
<br/>
What effects do you think would be good for us?  I know no one can be too<br/>
thrilled about the Summon Food and Water.  What could we get that would be<br/>
better used, seem like most of the other classes get truly useful effects so<br/>
far for the most part.<br/>
