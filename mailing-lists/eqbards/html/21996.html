<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583746917">Do you sing McVaxius&#39; Berzerker?  I have used my horn with this song <br/>
if I am in a tank heavy group and will swap out my Gypsy Lute for <br/>
Niv&#39;s and Hymn.  This of course is pre-50 :)  I like this combo for <br/>
tank heavy groups with a light healer.<br/>

max my<br/>
