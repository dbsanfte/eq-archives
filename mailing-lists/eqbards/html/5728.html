&gt;Well, based on suggestion here I went to Cazic Thule and played banker,<br/>
&gt;buying Fine Steel weapons and running them to a vendor. For some &quot;/shout<br/>
&gt;banker at zone&quot; may be fine but that is not the world /I/ live in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;friends, are you feeling tired, worn, sluggish? THink you might have iron<br/>
&gt;poor blood? Well friends...Dr. Tszaaz is here to help you, see you are<br/>
&gt;simply encumbered! And I am here at your front door to aleviate your<br/>
&gt;suffering...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;See, Cazic Thule has the largest collection of people BORED OUT OF THEIR<br/>
&gt;SKULL in the game. I mean these people might have been there for days, they<br/>
&gt;are stading around waiting for their turn to get rubicite. Something, btw,<br/>

&gt;won&#39;t be there for more than a couple of hours, if this means I will never<br/>
&gt;be in rubicite, so be it. But I digress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The next night was more fun...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Friends, I was like you, sure I was concerned about the proliferation of<br/>
&gt;Fine Steel Weapons in our society, but I thought, hey, I am one person,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can /I/ do? Then, having fallen into the lava in SolA I had a vision. And<br/>
&gt;when a passing wizard saved me from that lava I knew it was a sign to make<br/>
&gt;that vision become a reality! And so was born Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin&#39;s Weapons<br/>
&gt;buy back program...Fine Steel daggers 2pp, .....etc.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The banter began from there, and incidently I bought a bunch of weapons.<br/>
&gt;*laughs*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That same night I shouted a play-by-play of a fight going on at zone, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NO<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;entertainment. *laughs* So if you get the urge to make some money and do<br/>
&gt;your local career-campers a service, stop by and try out your latest song.<br/>
&gt;Hey, it&#39;s not like they are going to leave off camping to come duel<br/>
&gt;you...*smiles*<br/>
