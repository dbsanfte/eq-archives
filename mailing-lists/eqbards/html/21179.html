I have to agree with Kulanae&#39;s remark: why does such an intelligent and well<br/>
thought out post such as this get ignored, while posts requesting Verant to<br/>
fix the Goblin &#39;plumber&#39;s crack&#39; get an immediate response.<br/>
<br/>
My thruppence: I&#39;ve still been able to do somewhat effective crowd control<br/>
despite the uselessness of Lullaby and the resists on Chains.  I&#39;m still<br/>
levelling nicely and the groups I&#39;m in appreciate what I bring to the party.<br/>
I think I&#39;ve adapted well, considering.  Still, I haven&#39;t managed to<br/>
convince anyone else in my guild to play a Bard, which makes me feel even<br/>
better about myself. :)<br/>

PS.  I&#39;m sure that the whines on the Gameplay board are responsible for at<br/>
least 70% of the account cancellations out there.</div>
