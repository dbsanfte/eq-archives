<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944053842">I think this is due to the fact that you&#39;re not close enough.  I&#39;ve had the<br/>
same thing happen to me fighting a handful of creatures.  I get the<br/>
&quot;graphic&quot; but no message whatsoever (even though I&#39;m in melee range).  I<br/>
usually just take a few steps closer and let it pulse again, then it seems<br/>
to take effect.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d describe the range of screech as &quot;very small&quot;, but it<br/>
&gt; seems to vary I&#39;ve found.  I can be hitting cyclopses with<br/>
&gt; melee and they can be hitting me, and they&#39;re somehow<br/>
&gt; outside the range of the song.  But with giants, they seem<br/>
&gt; to be affected from outside melee range.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that with high blue or higher mobs, there&#39;s a<br/>
chance of this song simply not affecting them.  You see the<br/>
light effects, but there&#39;s no message of any type.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
this happen with cyclopses, Droon, giants, mammoths, griffons,<br/>
and a couple others (including one indoor mob).  If I keep the<br/>
song going, eventually it either works or I get a resist<br/>
message, even though neither of us have moved.  The higher<br/>
/con the mob, the greater the chance of this happening.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if this is a bug or a feature...<br/>
