you even do this?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Had a question for those on the list.  Over the last three<br/>
&gt; days...hmmm...that means since the last patch...hmmmm...I have had problems<br/>
&gt; receiving /tells.  At least 6 different people have complained that they<br/>
&gt; sent me /tells and I never responded.  One of them called me last nite and<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;Hey!  wtf.  Are you pissed at me for some reason?&quot;  In total<br/>
&gt; consternation I asked him what he was talking about and he said he had been<br/>
&gt; sending me /tells for the last 20 minutes and I hadn&#39;t answered a one.  I<br/>
&gt; was a city zone at the time so was actually not singing for a change except<br/>
&gt; to Carillion various folks looking for new quests.  I was able to scroll<br/>
&gt; back all the way to when I logged in and there were no /tells from him.<br/>
&gt; This was the 5th person in two days to complain that I was ignoring their<br/>
&gt; /tells.  These are all people I play with all the time so the chance they<br/>
&gt; mistyped something is nil.  Heck, I work with 3 of them.  I told my friend<br/>
&gt; to send me another /tell as soon as he got off his phone.  I waited for 15<br/>
&gt; minutes and never saw anything.  I think he gave up in disgust as it was<br/>
&gt; getting late, but he hasn&#39;t answered my email yet so I don&#39;t know for<br/>
&gt; certain.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else experienced any problems with this or am I the only one<br/>
&gt; &#39;going deaf&#39;?<br/>
