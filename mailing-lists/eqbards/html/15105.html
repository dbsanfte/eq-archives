<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464428254">Atually I&#39;ll probably use that a lot on my troll shaman ( currently level<br/>
21 ) because his intell is so low. It&#39;s just a pain hitting the skill over<br/>
and over.<br/>

&gt;&gt;wouldn&#39;t bother complaining about it though, or they&#39;d probably replace<br/>
&gt;&gt;it with a new find true north song. Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Note that the spell they replaced with True North, Sense Magic, is a<br/>
&gt;lvl 1, MAYBE lvl 4/5 spell. It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>
&gt;young, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>
&gt;now lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>
&gt;people still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>
&gt;spell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>
&gt;create a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>
&gt;I had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>
&gt;time it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>
&gt;maxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>
&gt;Sense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>
&gt;know. Just because you stay in your newbie area at that time does not mean<br/>
&gt;that everyone is.<br/>
