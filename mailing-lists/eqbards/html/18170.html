I was exploring the Eleven Outpost and found the vendor selling our new <br/>
songs. I compared it to what the Concert Hall had listed and found there <br/>
were 4 more not shown on the Concert Hall List. They are:<br/>
<br/>
L53 Song of the Dawn, Wind<br/>
L58 Jonathan&#39;s Inspiration, Brass<br/>
L60 Angstilich&#39;s Assonance, Wind<br/>
L60 Kazumi&#39;s Preservation, Brass<br/>
<br/>
Also a player was hunting a song called Boombastic Bellow for a quest, <br/>
didn&#39;t get any details of what quest he was doing. An npc on one of the <br/>
docks sells a Box of Lute Strings, Unfinished Lute neck, raw bamboo, and one <br/>
other flute part. I didn&#39;t find a bard GM.<br/>
<br/>
Dreadlands: L40 yardtrash, all you can pull and more. I love this zone!<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>
Knight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>
Excalibur, Xegony<br/>
