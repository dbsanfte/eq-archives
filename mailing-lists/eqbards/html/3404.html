<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990842265">Welcome!´┐¢ I play on Innoruuk too!´┐¢ Give me a /tell sometime and we can meet<br/>
up!´┐¢ I know some great hunting spots -´┐¢and you should be doing great<br/>
especially in the Karanas.´┐¢ Since you are rich -´┐¢I would´┐¢guess that you´┐¢have<br/>
a good magic hitter - if not get the Dragoon Dirk.´┐¢ I´┐¢prefer it to my<br/>
combine long slasher even.´┐¢ I just made 15 and am going to have fun with the<br/>
new lullaby song.´┐¢ <br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Playing 2 or more songs at the same time - can be a great value.´┐¢ Remember<br/>
that not only do you get the effects but everyone in your group gets them<br/>
too.´┐¢ So if one is good two is twice as good!´┐¢ The Anthem de Arms is a super<br/>
buff and stacks well with the Hymm of Restoration.´┐¢ Every now and then I<br/>
like to let loose with´┐¢a great bellow just for the fun of seeing the monstie<br/>
reel with pain!<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
At some point in our careers, we get the chance to satnd off and provide our<br/>
services with our instruments equipped and aviod the melee.´┐¢ I am anxious to<br/>
try that out myself but i think you need to have a poarty of regulars who<br/>
understand what you are doing.´┐¢ Then seeing instrument equipped song effect<br/>
and two or more playing at the same time should be really great.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Sylly - the bard!<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
p.s. we should get Cunobel and Harmonic - a 4 bard party - now that would be<br/>
great!´┐¢ Hmm Roofus and Sinatrah too! Awesome!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Hi Everyone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ I just joined the mailing and wanted to say hey to everyone. I play on<br/>
the Innoruuk server and have just reached lvl 12. Even though I&#39;ve been a<br/>
bard for a while now, I still have many questions. First off, I hear about<br/>
how people can twist songs to get multiple effects. At what point does this<br/>
become a part of everyday bard life? Right now, it works, but I guess I&#39;m<br/>
just not used to it because I hardly ever see the use. Also, for soloing,<br/>
what are two good songs to stack at my lvl?I can get to working on my<br/>
stacking skill. :) <br/>
´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ Also, I have a secret for all of my fellow bards. Do pottery. Make pie<br/>
tins until you puke. Right now, at lvl 12, I have a complete set of bronze<br/>
armor and 250pp in the bank all because I make pie tins and sell them to NPC<br/>
Merchants. Halas is the best place to do it´┐¢because everything you need is<br/>
in one zone and close together. Seriously, give it a try. You will not be<br/>
disappointed. <br/>
´┐¢<br/>
