<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819304858">I don&#39;t have this song yet but I thought its primary utililty was an escape<br/>
mechanism for the bard.  For example, you are in a fight in which you are<br/>
likely to die.  You know its time to start running but first you sing the MM<br/>
to teleport away from the creatures whacking you.  This gives you a<br/>
headstart against the mob and allows you to start singing Selos and equip<br/>
your drum to assist your escape.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone confirm if MM assists in escaping from mobs in the manner I<br/>
described?  Also, if you are in a group, does it teleport everyone the same<br/>
distance and direction or is it completely random for everyone?<br/>
