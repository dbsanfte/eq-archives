<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698518989">Trying to come up with a song that is <br/>
<br/>
1) extremely powerful<br/>
2) no other class has<br/>
3) makes bards extremely wanted on raids (a la<br/>
enchanters)<br/>
4) and has coding already built into the game<br/>
<br/>
I came up with a song that is the opposite of<br/>
Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion.  A song that teleports<br/>
all party members in the zone to the bards location.<br/>
<br/>
Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>
<br/>
This song would be extremely useful in conjuction with<br/>
a binding group leader.  Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid<br/>
in SolB and wanting to bring in other members since<br/>
some need to leave.  Instead of breaking through again<br/>
the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up<br/>
the bard and gate back to his bindpoint.  The group<br/>
leader would then group up the 4 new members and the<br/>
song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to<br/>
the bard.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a few problems with this that may make it<br/>
too powerful.  Such as Plane of Sky (never been<br/>
myself) where this song could not be used to bypass<br/>
the teleporters etc...  Also this song may need to<br/>
remove the party members from all hate lists or risk<br/>
causing a hellish train through the zone.<br/>
<br/>
If it does remove everyone from hate list the song<br/>
becomes MUCH more powerful (too powerful?) in that in<br/>
Plane of Hate things go bad.  The bard runs up the<br/>
wall away from the fight and sings the song, everyone<br/>
teleports up the bard and is removed from hate list. <br/>
Therefore removing the need for clerics to camp out<br/>
etc...  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make the<br/>
bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially<br/>
raids.<br/>
<br/>
The song may need to use up mana, although I really<br/>
don&#39;t want all our songs using up mana.  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what you all think.  Its just an<br/>
idea I came up with when I should be working =)<br/>
