&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a related note (Bard joke), I find that the proc on the BoH, although it <br/>
&gt;is supposedly instantaneous,<br/>
&gt;actually takes about half of a normal song cycle to work properly.  If I <br/>
&gt;assume that it works instantly<br/>
&gt;(as the icon suggests), and press another song key, I get song-locked every <br/>
&gt;time.  It takes some getting<br/>
&gt;used to.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have a kind of crummy <br/>
&gt;machine running on a dial-up, so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;singing through lag a lot, and anticipating song pulses rather than waiting <br/>
&gt;for the messages, so maybe the<br/>
&gt;rest of you have better luck with it.  We were killing the King in Chardok <br/>
&gt;last night, and I was singing<br/>
&gt;songs two full songs ahead of the messages, which shows how bad it gets for <br/>
&gt;me (I was actually able to<br/>
&gt;twist three, I&#39;ve played this Bard so much).<br/>
