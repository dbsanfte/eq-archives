enjoying it. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you want to incorporate downtime recovery into the<br/>
&gt;equation, necros become even better.  Their lich line<br/>
<br/>
&gt;of spells convert hp to mana at a ratio approaching <br/>
&gt;1:1 at level 49 (c.f. 3:1 for manastones), and their <br/>
&gt;lifetap spells convert mana back to hp while damaging<br/>
<br/>
&gt;the mob.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you have to incorporate downtime recovery<br/>
don&#39;t you?  I certainly think so.  IMO the most<br/>
efficiency i&#39;ve ever seen over time is a constant<br/>
stream of fighting without downtime (like 3-4 hours<br/>
without any downtime. :)  Necro&#39;s do shine here. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All fear does is increase your survival time - I <br/>
&gt;*have* accounted for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fear lets dot&#39;s do full instead of 2/3 damage.  That&#39;s<br/>
pretty significantly more than survival time, that&#39;s<br/>
increased damage over time in addition to the reduced<br/>
damage taken over time. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No it isn&#39;t as clear cut.  But my main point is that <br/>
&gt;being in a group cannot make the group *worse* than <br/>
&gt;you are solo (stupidity excepted).  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup I agree here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Given that necros are great soloing, a group with a <br/>
&gt;necro cannot be any worse than the necro is solo.  <br/>
&gt;Since necros are regularly able to solo some of the <br/>
&gt;toughest mobs in the game (outside of the planes), <br/>
&gt;that means any group with a necro will be able to <br/>
&gt;take on the toughest mobs in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree, a necro can still solo the ghoul lord room<br/>
with FD and pet where adding more people (unless they<br/>
had FD as well) would only hurt.  The above statement<br/>
is true for most instances but not quite all.<br/>
