<div id="ygrps-yiv-236949896">so are you saying that you went aggro (KOS) to the giants but were able to<br/>
raise faction back up that you are now able to use the giant city without<br/>
any mishaps?<br/>

we started off allying with dwarves/dragons.  now we are giant lovers.  we<br/>
killed their king first of course hehe.  you are right about the imbalance.<br/>
allying with dragons/dwarves has absolutely no reward loot-wise.  killing<br/>
dain/yel is far better.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the entire Velious faction/loot setup is all out of <br/>
&gt; balance.  Seems<br/>
&gt; to me that allying with the giants is far and away the best <br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
