<div id="ygrps-yiv-856647579">I&#39;m guessing you are referring to a Solo type situation.  When Charm is used<br/>
in a group situation for crowd control you tend to want to stay with the<br/>
group.  This is especially true with fighting in crowded areas outside<br/>
Karnor&#39;s Castle in Dreads where you don&#39;t want to start attracting other<br/>
mobs and interfering with other groups.<br/>

&gt; if you are outside you should never get smacked when recharming, no matter<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; many resists it takes.  remember you can move and sing at the same time.<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; just back off from the 2 things fighting with selos on.  when charm<br/>
breaks, start running<br/>
&gt; in a circle with the charm/charm/selo&#39;s sequence until charm retakes.  if<br/>
you get adds<br/>
&gt; then you have to run in a circle continuously but you should still never<br/>
get hit.<br/>
