<div id="ygrps-yiv-213916733">Uhhh love - your problem is your Mino Horn - it&#39;s wind, not brass.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite area to do this is right inside the zone to crushbone with<br/>
Dennon&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So far - at lvl 21 - my personal best train to stop - all on my wittle<br/>
loansome is (all from the castle) 5 Legs, an emmissary an oracle and Lord<br/>
Darish.<br/>
<br/>
Course - throw Dvinn into that mess - all bets are off - he&#39;s the only<br/>
thing in there that can still hit me reliably - and it still hurts.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m Crier Sharpsong, a 26th half-elf Bard on Fennin Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been having a recurring problem getting my Brass skill up and would<br/>
&gt;like to ask people here about it.  I&#39;ve read time and again that I should<br/>
&gt;venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord and leave<br/>
&gt;it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I have not been<br/>
&gt;successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>
&gt;and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the area, not<br/>
&gt;actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur Horn, fired up,<br/>
&gt;fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, DDD<br/>
&gt;and went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>
&gt;&quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much about it.  Got<br/>
&gt;back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>
&gt;have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time I was in the<br/>
&gt;bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn (tired of the bag<br/>
&gt;in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last night I tried<br/>
&gt;practicing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;actually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought Screech and am<br/>
&gt;completely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I tried to start<br/>
&gt;Screech (literally) about 300 times last night with and without the horn<br/>
&gt;equipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get is DDD starts, I<br/>
&gt;briefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s just me standing<br/>
&gt;there.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need* this song, but<br/>
&gt;if Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to increase my Brass<br/>
&gt;skill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m screwed.  I *WILL* die<br/>
&gt;trying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>
