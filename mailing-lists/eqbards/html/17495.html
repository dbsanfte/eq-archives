<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094588998">If you&#39;re in Freeport, head out to the dervish camp in<br/>
West Commons.  They spawn fast enough to support two<br/>
groups and drop bronze weapons.  (And they aggro bards<br/>
more than the crushbone orcs ever did)<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re there, see the armoror on the thrid floor<br/>
of the Freeport militia bldg and do the Reserve<br/>
Militia Tunic quest.  They are only AC 9 but +3 dex<br/>
and look very cool.  Like blood red chain.  I had a DE<br/>
SK offer me 50 plat for mine the other night in<br/>
Lavastorm.  Too bad it&#39;s no drop;-)<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re in the commons, watch out for people<br/>
asking for help in body recovery -- most of them want<br/>
you to go to Kithicor forest...and it seems like most<br/>
of them want to go just before nightfall.  If that&#39;s<br/>
the case, make them wait for morning.<br/>

&gt; finding the adventures there entertaining, but she<br/>
&gt; has suddenly found<br/>
&gt; herself without any burning immediate goals.  What<br/>
&gt; excitement waits<br/>
&gt; for a Bard of 12 songs? <br/>
