&gt; Err should be get not use. The research words are ungodly hard to<br/>
&gt; find even<br/>
&gt; for the 44th pet let alone 49th. I know quite a few 50 necros<br/>
&gt; using the 39th<br/>
&gt; and even the 34th pet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not on Prexus!  I&#39;ve grouped with maybe 8 or 9 level 49 or 50 necros and all<br/>
but one had the level 49 pet.  The one I do know that was still using the<br/>
level 44 pet was doing so just because he had no INCENTIVE to get a level 49<br/>
pet!  He simply didn&#39;t think he needed that much more fire power and it<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth his time... besides he was having too much fun twinking his<br/>
bard :-).  I can&#39;t imagine a mage begin very effective with a pet 10 to 15<br/>
levels lower then him.<br/>
