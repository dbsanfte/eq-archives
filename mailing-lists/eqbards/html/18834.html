<br/>
Switching subjects here, but I question the value of invisibility now.<br/>
Whats the rationale on why most mobs in Kunark see thru invis?  In my<br/>
experience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>
were undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>
completely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>
Indifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>
higher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>
invis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>
most part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>
the giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>
though they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>
me but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Also, by<br/>
the time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>
effect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>
they are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>
Invisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>
as worthless.<br/>

<br/>
level 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something like this.  level 53 to get these is<br/>
completely useless.  a warrior getting invisibility at level 53 however is<br/>
something they would absolutely DIE for.<br/>
