<div id="ygrps-yiv-719519495">On E&#39;ci as far as I know nobody has attempted PoF since 9 groups got<br/>
destroyed as soon as they enterered. They really need to tweak this and make<br/>
it a bit easier.<br/>

&gt;Hiya fellow bard =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just wanted to ask you if you have been doing plane of fear at all since<br/>
&gt;they nerfed it (well not technically a nerf, but realistically they F&#39;d it<br/>
&gt;up if you ask me).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know of two attempts that were made on my server (Veeshan) since the<br/>
&gt;update, and both were disasters.<br/>
&gt;36 ppl were slaughtered by 4 mobs, went back to get their corpses and all<br/>
&gt;went LD, and were killed again. This was the first attempt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All i know about the second attempt is there was again 30+ people and they<br/>
&gt;almost had a scareling dead, but were jumped by a few more mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wanted to know if you and your group(s) have had any success in PoF since<br/>
&gt;the update, and if so do you have any tips for us over on Veeshan. (I just<br/>
&gt;got 46 recently, and I&#39;m not looking forward to losing it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are countless 46+ ppl on Veeshan, but everyone is afraid to go to PoF<br/>
&gt;=(<br/>
