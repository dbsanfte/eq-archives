<div id="ygrps-yiv-10628436">That&#39;s a really great story Talies, but what were you doing aiding a<br/>
Shadowknight?  Cavorting with the walking dead is bad for the complexion!  I<br/>
try to always avoid even conversing with those who think a walking pile of<br/>
bones makes a good &#39;pet&#39;.  I mean what if that stuff is catching!  Think of<br/>
what it would do to your singing voice!  All those raspy voices!  Icky in<br/>
the extreme!  <br/>
<br/>
Remember, try to group with people who won&#39;t be liable to give you a skin<br/>
condition that makes body parts fall off at random intervals.  Ogres and<br/>
Trolls might not be all bad, but stay away from the Necro types!<br/>

Last night, in Lake Rathe, I grouped with an Ogre Shadowknight and a<br/>
Half-elf Rogue.  We were working on Aviak guards on an island all to<br/>
ourselves, and doing fine - finishing each guard with no more than half a<br/>
bubble or so down each.  I needed to go to bed, but since I have a great<br/>
connection, I told them that I could stay logged in, and sleeping nearby<br/>
while playing the Hymn, so they could take advantage of it.  Cheesy, yeah,<br/>
but I was curious about something.  I sat and watched while they fought,<br/>
and round after round, they were finishing almost nearly the same as if I<br/>
had been fighting.  Whether there was some other dynamic force in effect I<br/>
wasn&#39;t aware of, I don&#39;t know - but it seems almost as though I didn&#39;t even<br/>
need to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Rogue had to leave, something about bloodclaws, and that left the<br/>
SK fighting alone, well, him and his skellie, and I stayed watching, just<br/>
to see what would happen (and in case he got waxed - I&#39;m not stupid ;).<br/>
For the next hour, he fought - never dropping below three bubbles, and when<br/>
he did, he&#39;d just back close enough to me to start healing again.  At one<br/>
time, an Aviak decided I was doing too good a job and started pounding on<br/>
me, but it wasn&#39;t much, so I just let it while the Ogre continued to fight.<br/>
 After that, I guess he decided that it was too dangerous to play like that<br/>
with me &quot;unconcious&quot;, so he disbanded the party, and went in search of a<br/>
group (about ten minutes later, they took over the nest again).  <br/>
<br/>
All in all, I am incredibly impressed with our ability - just by sitting<br/>
there, playing the Lute, I made such a significant difference that he was<br/>
&quot;soloing&quot; things that were yellow to him.  That&#39;s just amazing.<br/>
