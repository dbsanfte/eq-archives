wasn&#39;t just bad luck. Either they gimped lullaby yet again or the Cazic<br/>
mobs are just able to cast in their sleep.<br/>

Having loved the way Lullaby worked back in beta (I was one of the bards<br/>
that had the entire population of Blackburrow asleep in that screenshot<br/>
on Stratics) I&#39;ve had a on again off again relationship with Lullaby<br/>
since. Sometimes it seems to work great, and saves our whole partie&#39;s<br/>
butts, other times it&#39;s not worth keeping loaded. A couple of weeks ago<br/>
I had it loaded in lower guk, and used it when a pull in the undead<br/>
tower go _way_ more ghouls than normal. (anyone else notice that when<br/>
someone else stirs up that place and gates it stays stirred up even<br/>
after they gate?) Usually using an area effect song in that place is a<br/>
quick ticket out of the place, with it&#39;s buggy z axis allowing casters 2<br/>
floors down to detect and cast on you, but this time it slept a bunch of<br/>
ghouls long enough for my party to finish off way more than we normally<br/>
could have handled.<br/>
