<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741419687">Been out of town for a week...just before I left I discovered a fine method<br/>
of raising Iksar faction, run into the Sarnak fort in the Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
playing Screech, then book it out of town and hunt elsewhere in the zone for<br/>
the rest of the night, you will ring up faction hits like clockwork *grin*<br/>
Eventually the Iksar guards will be tolerant of me, but I understand that<br/>
everyone else in the city will still hate me, well, it&#39;s a start.<br/>
<br/>
All the exp issues I had before seemed to have disappeared in Kunark, I am<br/>
leveling at breakneck speed, 29 and counting, in fact I am going to wait to<br/>
go buy songs until I hit 30, I just don&#39;t want to take the time off. I am<br/>
not ususally a powerleveler at all, but everyone in the guild is tapping<br/>
their foot waiting for me to get the mana song, so, for now, it&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
Log_In();<br/>
while(m_iLevel &lt;32 && m_bAwake)<br/>
    m_iLevel += ppWackStuff(&m_lPlat);<br/>
Log_Out();<br/>
