<br/>
I have a question for y&#39;all.  I know some bards are huge fans of Siren&#39;s<br/>
Song (aka &quot;Charm&quot;).  For me, however, it just doesn&#39;t match the power of<br/>
Fear + Chains.  The problem with Charm, IMO, is the fact that you have to<br/>
find two equal opponents within close proximity of each other.  Even if<br/>
you&#39;re lucky enough to find two MOBs like this, they are usually so well<br/>
matched that it&#39;s hard to end up in control of the victorious MOB.  I was<br/>
playing around with Cyclops in Rathe Mnts. using Charm... I had terrible<br/>
luck.  Either my charmed Cyclops wouldn&#39;t attack my intended victim (he&#39;d<br/>
run around almost randomly), or I could never end up in control of the<br/>
winning MOB.  I usually stand at max distance from the combatants and<br/>
re-charm when they start running at me.  I think I need to get them<br/>
perpendicular to me, but that requires a lot of running and positioning,<br/>
while maintaining your targets, and Charming is difficult to begin with.<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard about combinations such as Charm + Fear and Charm + Chain<br/>
but, quite frankly, I don&#39;t understand how this would help (fearing the<br/>
non-charmed MOB would ensure that your charmed MOB would be in better<br/>
conditial (i.e. more likely to win)).  I&#39;d probably use Fear + Chain all the<br/>
time, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that Fear mis-fires quite a bit (I think<br/>
this has something to do with my low &quot;Brass&quot; skill (it&#39;s about 30 pts.<br/>
underneath my level cap)).<br/>
<br/>
Any comments, stories, suggestions to share?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
