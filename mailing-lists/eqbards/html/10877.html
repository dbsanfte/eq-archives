<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44484869">I would guess we should be using the Queen Klicknack as a clue.  To get her<br/>
to spawn you have to kill both the Prince and the Princess and while they<br/>
are both dead she may (10% maybe) spawn.  Yet the Queen is seen all the time<br/>
because the Prince and Princess are easily killed and give decent xp when<br/>
other Klicknacks are too green.  There is no reason to think this level of<br/>
symbiosis in the spawning process stops at higher levels, it just becomes<br/>
more subtle.  No longer do the mob names give away what you have to kill to<br/>
spawn a particular mob, but chances are if you keep killing things<br/>
eventually some of them may be figured out.  I killed the Prince and<br/>
Princess hundreds of times at lower levels to get the Queen to spawn before<br/>
noting that she never spawned if I just kill Princes, or just killed<br/>
Princesses, but only if I continuously killed both.  All this to get an<br/>
warrior friend who decided to become a jeweler some enchanted silver.  If<br/>
Clerics would start looking for these triggers instead of just complaining<br/>
I&#39;m willing to bet at least in some of the cases they will find them.<br/>
Course complaining is much easier I will be the first to admit.<br/>

In the patch news there is mention of a system they have where you have to<br/>
kill some things to make certain other things spawn.  I know that is pretty<br/>
vague and knowing Verant it might be pretty obtuse.  But I bet there is a<br/>
&#39;trick&#39; to it and someone will discover it.  And then for all of 3 days he<br/>
will be the only one with the stuff.  As soon as he tells his best friend...<br/>
3days later lots will have and every spoiler site will have details.<br/>
<br/>
Just a guess,<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
for Zahal - try killing all the ghouls and undead - like lots and lots and<br/>
lots - just guessing but they did say you have to kill stuff...<br/>
