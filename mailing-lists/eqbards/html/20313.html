<div id="ygrps-yiv-405311754">I have to say - although I have been programming since high school in the<br/>
late 70&#39;s (and hence the subsequent knowledge of computing) - I am very<br/>
mechanically dis-inclined.  I am incapable of such things as simple<br/>
household repairs or things like changing my own oil...<br/>
<br/>
	That said - there&#39;s only two reasons I can see to buy (as opposed to<br/>
building) a PC is if you are so strapped for time - that paying additional<br/>
money to save time is worthwhile to you.  Building a PC now in my mind is<br/>
equivalent to the change in buying stereo components as opposed to the<br/>
console systems that were popular up to the late 70&#39;s.  The second reason is<br/>
tech support.<br/>
<br/>
	Mounting the motherboard is a bit tricky the first time you&#39;ve done one.<br/>
Lining up the drives in the drive bays can also be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
	Now - if you&#39;ve owned a PC or two and never ever called the tech support<br/>
line - and you have some time to spare - you are throwing money away buying<br/>
a Compaq, Gateway, Dell etc.  It&#39;s amazing how powerful the low-end chips<br/>
are now (Celeron, Duron&#39;s etc).<br/>
<br/>
	A good buddy of mine (formerly professional musician, now in property<br/>
management - very non-technical) is consulting me for advice on a new PC<br/>
(he&#39;s helped others build them before).  He&#39;s getting a new case,<br/>
motherboard, Duron 500, 128 MB of PC133 memory.  This will cost between<br/>
$300-400.  He&#39;s using his old Hard Disk, Voodoo3 3000 PCI, SoundBlaster,<br/>
Floppy, and Modem.  He can upgrade each piece at his convenience.<br/>
<br/>
	A couple months ago I spent less than $1700 to build a high-end Athlon 800<br/>
box that would have cost close to thousand more to buy the equivalent box<br/>
from a Big-name (or even small name) PC company.<br/>
