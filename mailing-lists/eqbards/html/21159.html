<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470146458">I&#39;m still hundreds of emails behind, but if you&#39;re still on the list,<br/>
then safe travels to you my friend.<br/>
Tszaaz was one of my heroes and I always looked forward to your posts.<br/>
You&#39;ll be missed.<br/>
<br/>
By the Marrs, I looked forward to your posts even more than John<br/>
(TM)&#39;s!  Or is that too sacrilegious?<br/>
&lt;grinning so evilly I simply MUST be wearing a mask of deception&gt;<br/>

PS:  Gilgurth&#39;s probably gone by now, but I read his &quot;goodbye&quot; message<br/>
only about an hour ago.  Gil, if<br/>
you&#39;re still with us, I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re leaving because RL is<br/>
better than EQ, and not because EQ<br/>
isn&#39;t cutting it.  Your family must be wonderful.  Safe travels to you<br/>
as well.<br/>
