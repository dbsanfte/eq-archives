<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952428575"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; group playing in lower guk.  bard dies.  cleric<br/>
&gt; resses bard.  have a nice day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t have a cleric in your group in lower<br/>
&gt; guk (or anywhere for that matter in high level<br/>
&gt; dungeons), then you should expect to die often.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re assuming that you are of a level to group with<br/>
a level 29 cleric. Let&#39;s go with what you said above.<br/>
&quot;if you dont have a cleric you should<br/>
expect to die often.&quot; (paraphrased of course)<br/>
<br/>
So, because there&#39;s no cleric in my group, or because<br/>
I&#39;m not high enough level to group with a level 29<br/>
cleric - I should be expected to run through 6+ zones<br/>
back to my corpse while a wizard can bind himself right<br/>
outside of the dungeon or place we&#39;re in? I still don&#39;t<br/>
see the logic. All classes should be able to be bound<br/>
in the same places as any other class can. That&#39;s all<br/>
there is to it.</div>
