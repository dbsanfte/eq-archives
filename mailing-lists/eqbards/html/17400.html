<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111692073">Without resending this thread, the discussion was about whether specific <br/>
character types should be allowed to lotto for specific items.<br/>
<br/>
My own stance on this is:  if it isn&#39;t no-drop/not bard, or lore/I <br/>
already own it, I have a right to lotto for it.  This isn&#39;t Baldur&#39;s <br/>
Gate, where I&#39;m controlling a party of six, and I maximize my personal <br/>
effectiveness by putting the best equipment with the most appropriate <br/>
character.  I&#39;ve got one character in this game.  Me.  There isn&#39;t a <br/>
prayer that I would buy the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument in a pickup <br/>
group, and seeing just how often players pick up and move between guilds, <br/>
I don&#39;t even buy it at the guild level. Among very close, trusted <br/>
friends, I&#39;ll do it, but even then only if it doesn&#39;t happen repeatedly. <br/>
<br/>
Even if I can&#39;t use the item effectively, it&#39;s still a tradeable item <br/>
that I can use to get something I CAN use.  And if I start to buy in to <br/>
the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument, I&#39;ll never get anything but <br/>
instruments, and I&#39;ll certainly never have anything lying around my bank <br/>
to allow me to trade up.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m good enough to be in the group, I&#39;m good enough to lotto for any <br/>
item the group gets.  If they can use it better than I can, they can <br/>
trade me something for it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a complete hard-ass about this, btw.  My first FG run, when the <br/>
leader asked all melee types to lotto for mith arms, I rolled (to the <br/>
annoyance of many) and won (to the even greater annoyance of many).  I <br/>
gave them to my level 50 warrior friend.  But he&#39;s given ME stuff, and I <br/>
know he&#39;s not going to take them and sell them on EBay or anything.<br/>
