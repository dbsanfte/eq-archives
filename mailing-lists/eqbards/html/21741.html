*looks over his shoulder*  <br/>
*puts tin foil over his head*  &lt;-- simpsons episode where baseball league<br/>
was spying on consumers<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I doubt anyone saw this commercial (for NFL) for the Ottawa Senators<br/>
but its a parody of Sixth Sense. The 2 are in the car at a stop light, and a<br/>
crossing guard is helping kids cross the street and the kid in the car tursn<br/>
to his mom and says in a whisper &quot;i see hockey players&quot;. cracks me up every<br/>
time<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excellent point Slyde. I noticed that even this mail list isn&#39;t very secure <br/>
in that it does not mask your IP address that you sent your email from. If <br/>
you send email from the same computer you play Everquest on, and use a <br/>
client like Microsoft Outlook (or Eudora), then it&#39;s quite likely you are <br/>
broadcasting your IP address (kinda like I am, but this isn&#39;t my home <br/>
computer).<br/>
<br/>
Once someone has your IP address, they can try all sorts of attacks and try <br/>
to sniff out your password, unless you have a firewall. Are we paranoid yet?<br/>
