<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188962230">My hardest one ever was in Lake Rathe. I used a canoe & Lycos to find the<br/>
underwater corpse.  Then the owner was able to /corpse it up into the boat<br/>
and we dragged it to shore where she could loot it once she got outta the<br/>
canoe.  Maybbe that guy can /corpse it onto the boat or at least drag it to<br/>
the next stop. Otherwise it&#39;s GM time and wait for help.<br/>
<br/>
I find it real hard to turn down requests.  I get really mad when they don&#39;t<br/>
do what I says.  If its evident that it&#39;s a bug - sometimes you gotta tell<br/>
them to petition and wait (petitions get cleared when u log.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you got to say &quot;I cant help you - its beyond my skills&quot; - I would<br/>
not attempt to go deep into Runnyeye for example.  <br/>
<br/>
I have asked other bards for help and have been turned down simply because<br/>
they wanted to be warriors or clerics right then (did not want to stop<br/>
hack&#39;n slash for helpin some one) instead of being a bard.  But that&#39;s their<br/>
char. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get desparate requests and say &quot;yes, I will help you but I need<br/>
20 more minutes with my party and then I&#39;ll come help.&quot; Usually, they find<br/>
them selves or get a loc by then.  Except one guy who was lost under a wall<br/>
in SplitPaw and that took 2 nights and help from some high levels before a<br/>
GM came and dragged him into view.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a hard one and you need to figure out just how far you will go.  A<br/>
lot depends on your assessment of your own capabilities to help and then to<br/>
be able to communicate to him how to get help when it&#39;s beyond what you are<br/>
able or willing to do.<br/>

		His corpse is *way* offshore - and it gets seriously deep<br/>
out there - after<br/>
		you swim past the sharks.  &quot;Oh, I died on the boat and I&#39;ll<br/>
bet my corpse fell<br/>
		off when it hit the zone border.&quot;  Ok, sounds plausible.<br/>
&quot;Well, it&#39;s in that<br/>
		direction.  Good luck.&quot;  I say.  &quot;Wait!  I need for you to<br/>
go with me and<br/>
		point at my corpse.&quot;</div>
