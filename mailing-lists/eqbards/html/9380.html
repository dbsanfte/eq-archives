<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138740581">Whew, I feel much better now.  My /play time with Kitasi is only 22 hours<br/>
and something.  I have started moving a little better now after spending 6<br/>
weeks at 16th level, minus the few times I was 17th, or (gasp) 15th, in the<br/>
middle.  16th sure felt like a hell level to me!<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing Kitasi more than any other character though by far,<br/>
mainly because he is perfect for completing quests which is my main focus in<br/>
the game 50% of the time.  Bards provide more opportunities for role-playing<br/>
as well which makes the game more enjoyable for me.  <br/>
<br/>
The main reason I play my Cleric is also due to lack of finding others,<br/>
though usually it is lack of finding other&#39;s to bind me.  Kaladim during<br/>
prime time last nite, 3 people no binders :(  In fact if my bard could bind<br/>
I doubt I would play my other characters ever.  I couldn&#39;t get the time of<br/>
day from anyone in BB last nite as they were all in too big a hurry to get<br/>
to Kedge.  I had wanted to check it out for looks while there were sure to<br/>
be plenty of people cleaning it out, but couldn&#39;t get bound so I headed over<br/>
to Greater Faydark and stumbled onto a GM event :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the first time lack of a bind was ever beneficial.  I had a blast<br/>
fighting off the dark elf invaders, was very surprised I could hurt them.<br/>
Was even more surprised when I actually got the attention of one and they<br/>
started beating on me.  Fortunately I quickly beat feet and ran circles<br/>
around her.  One big disad GM run critters have over AI critters is response<br/>
time.  I could run circles around her and keep bellowing away and she<br/>
couldn&#39;t get a bead on me.  good thing too cause she smacked me down 3<br/>
bubbles real quick when she did catch me in melee.  Made some friends with<br/>
some folks more your level or higher who had no healers available.  Even my<br/>
paltry 9 points a pulse felt good to them after sitting and getting 2.  One<br/>
even rewarded me with a Lambent Stone for saving him from the Dark Elf<br/>
Cleric.  All in all a fun nite despite the zone crash.<br/>

Hehe - actually I think you would also get a laff out of my /played time<br/>
which is I think more than 68 days now.  Most high lev&#39;s would really laff<br/>
that I am not PoF able with that amount of time logged in.  In fact, I guess<br/>
I disprove my own saying that all you have to do to level is put the time<br/>
in.  I am a really in-efficient player when it comes to time/level over all.<br/>
<br/>
Like it said, I started a war and played him to level 13. I played him and<br/>
Sylly alternately for about 3 weeks then robbed him and parked him.  I have<br/>
a few hours in other chars just to have a feel for the screens they look at<br/>
and the stuff they do - like casters.  I have a cleric who is level 8 and<br/>
slowly getting twinked up.  A big reason I play her is so that I stay out of<br/>
trouble when I have online time and my group is not around.  I am getting<br/>
real paranoid about dieing and the time required to make up for lost ground.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So ya, if you want to level, you need to focus on one char and be in a group<br/>
after lev 12 to 15 when you cant effectively solo any more.  That don&#39;t mean<br/>
that is what I did - I went weeks sometimes without a level - because I was<br/>
exploring or questing. Or adventuring and helping people. <br/>

		Wow, now that is a blast from the past.  On a related note.<br/>
The current<br/>
		Kitasi began a mere 5 days before Sylly, but is still only<br/>
18 songs along<br/>
		the path.  Maybe I should quit playing multiple characters.<br/>
;-)<br/>

		Saw that I had 1849 items in my bard folder and thought I<br/>
should toss a few<br/>
		out.  Jumped to the first one and thought you might enjoy...<br/>
