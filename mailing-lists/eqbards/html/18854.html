 </span></blockquote>We went to E3 last week - I got to talk face to face with GZ, god those<br/>
folks are good at wiggling out of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
First of all - they were demoing EQ at two different booths - at least. GMs<br/>
were doing the demo - with THEIR GM accounts. Boy - all the feedback they<br/>
get is sweet - numeric faction changes, mob level and HP, whole buncha<br/>
stuff. Plus of course that runnin REALLY REALLY fast thing. I told them it<br/>
was really NOT right to be showing off a published product in public with<br/>
that kind of client - not that there were many folks there that hadn&#39;t<br/>
played themselves, but it is VERY misleading demonstration. Did my heart<br/>
good to see a Black Screen of Death show up while I was there - least I&#39;m<br/>
not the only one. I asked why they were doing that - and why they got so<br/>
much valuable info we do not - the only answer was debugging - yeah<br/>
right....I think the main problem is they don&#39;t understand a regular client<br/>
because theirs doesn&#39;t have the same shortcomings. Anyway.....<br/>
<br/>
I asked GZ about a few things - like giving us a slot for an instrument<br/>
similiar to a range slot. Doubt that will ever happen, they consider it<br/>
more work to code than it&#39;s worth. He did say that they were going to try<br/>
to make items like MM Drums etc - taggable so you couldn&#39;t accidently drop<br/>
them on the ground. Also asked him about letting us setup a series of songs<br/>
so we weren&#39;t constantly having to twitch - since this isn&#39;t after all<br/>
supposed to be a twitch game. He gave some vague answer that at least let<br/>
me know they were thinking about doing something like that - but I&#39;ll not<br/>
be holding my breath.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested GZ subscribe to this list - he said someone forwarded him<br/>
&#39;important&#39; things. Grrrrrrr This list has the lowest noise to information<br/>
ratio of any I&#39;ve ever seen. The whole Verant&#39;s shit don&#39;t stink attitute<br/>
is really irritating. <br/>
<br/>
He then went on to tell me one of HIS main characters was a bard - and that<br/>
he played on a normal account - ummm, yeah right. Somehow I just couldn&#39;t<br/>
swallow that one. I got into the whole binding issue with him and another<br/>
programmer. I think Brad must put something in the company water cooler -<br/>
their eyes glaze over and they start chanting company mantra whenever<br/>
something doesn&#39;t fit &#39;the vision&#39;. I could instantly tell that the<br/>
official company policy on debating hard questions is &quot;What would YOU do?&quot;<br/>
Heard that one several times - unfortunately for them - I&#39;m not shy about<br/>
telling them - and I did. Hehehe, that tactic only works on some people. Ya<br/>
just don&#39;t lob the ball into someone else&#39;s court if they are gonna fire it<br/>
right back at ya *smile*.<br/>
<br/>
We had an appointment to interview Brad and John both - out of all the<br/>
developers we interviewed while we were there - they were they ONLY ones<br/>
that blew us off. Poor timing I guess - Keith Parkinson was supposed to be<br/>
there to sign the artwork of the Kunark box and a plane strike kept him<br/>
away - so the team was signing the posters instead. Brad was running around<br/>
- kept saying 30 more min guys.....  Well, at the end of 3 long days of<br/>
concrete standing - I guess my patience was a little thin. I had this<br/>
poster rolled up in my hand - I REALLY wanted to ask him why my poor bard<br/>
has to be next to naked for so long - my husband took it out of my hand and<br/>
bopped him over the head with it as he darted by once - yelling - GIVE MY<br/>
WIFE CLOTHES or some such thing. That was probably a personal highlight<br/>
from E3 for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - on a different subject entirely - Anarchy online and Shadowbane<br/>
are both looking VERY good - as does UO2 - now officially going by the name<br/>
of &quot;Origin&quot;.</div>
