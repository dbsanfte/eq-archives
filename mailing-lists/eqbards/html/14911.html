<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-248455955">A cold, cruel wind blows across the Southern Plain of Karana.  The escaped<br/>
Split Paw gnolls pay nary a bit of attention to the blue bardette as she<br/>
streaks by. Oh sure, they scowl but alas, lack the will necessary to<br/>
actually attack.  A walled compound appears on the horizon.  This bard has a<br/>
mission.<br/>
<br/>
The doors in wall have been foolishly left unlocked.  The front door on the<br/>
other hand is securely latched.  Our bardette goes to the rear of the cabin<br/>
and finds that she can sit very close the joint between the wall and the<br/>
chimney and peer in through a crack just well enough to catch a glimpse of<br/>
the hermit.  And then she plays a song that no one in the area can resist.<br/>
<br/>
When she has his attention and hails him, he responds in a very mean and<br/>
nasty manner. He asks who has the audacity to enter his house (we presume he<br/>
extends his definition of house to his whole property.) (Author&#39;s note: we<br/>
did not happen to capture the actual dialog but you can get it in person by<br/>
hailing him.  I wonder if they did not intend for there to be some &#39;secret<br/>
way&#39; of actually entering the house but it is yet undiscovered or not<br/>
implemented. As there are barrels placed such that you can easily get on the<br/>
roof, perhaps they had planned a pitfall through the roof as the way to get<br/>
inside. But then never did it as it would mean having also some way to get<br/>
out of the house.  Or a death trap for those too young to kill the hermit?)<br/>

The bardette looks at this hermit and wonders... are you the one who stole<br/>
the song from the lute repairman?  Hmmm, well, I guess there is one way to<br/>
find out. Follow me.<br/>

<br/>
So, Vhalen has triumphed over the forces of evil that stole his life&#39;s work<br/>
and happiness.  Unfortunately, he seems a bit confused about the bardette<br/>
and her role in the whole thing and now she makes haste for the stone bridge<br/>
and an escape from this madness.  &quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&quot;<br/>
