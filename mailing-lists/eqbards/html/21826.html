<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117784696">that analogy really has nothing to do with the ranting.  you still have the<br/>
choice to ride a different ride or don&#39;t go to the park anymore.  in both<br/>
cases there is no point to ranting about that same roller coaster forever.<br/>

&gt;Inducing - Super Exciting - Mega-Roller Coaster is replaced with a<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you complain about it - they initially say that there was no change to<br/>
&gt;the roller coaster.  When you show them pictures of the old and new one -<br/>
&gt;they say they&#39;ll look into it.  After six months of no response - they come<br/>
&gt;back and tell you that the original roller coaster was way too scary - that<br/>
&gt;the other customers who didn&#39;t like roller coasters - but preferred the<br/>
&gt;twist-o-whirl - were complaining that the roller coaster was too exciting in<br/>
&gt;comparison - and had to be toned down - so there twist-o-whirl was the most<br/>
&gt;exciting ride in the park...<br/>

&gt; &gt;To be honest I think the ranting would stop the first time we ever got a<br/>
&gt; &gt;real answer other than &quot;we&#39;ll look into it at some point&quot; and &quot;working as<br/>
&gt; &gt;intended&quot;.  I know if I ever saw real progress on these issues I&#39;d be the<br/>
&gt; &gt;first to say wtg!  Anyone who is familiar with my opinions on trade skills<br/>
&gt; &gt;would know that.  IMHO Yak is the best thing to happen to Verant since<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kunark.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Kit<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
&gt;amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
&gt;coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>
&gt;expecting<br/>
&gt;the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;like it,<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;waste<br/>
&gt;of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.<br/>
