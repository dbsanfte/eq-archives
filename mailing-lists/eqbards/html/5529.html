funky lava diving story for the list soon.. hehe<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; run across Nekulutos forest to get there is exciting<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started a DE player once just to see Neriak (BOY am I<br/>
glad I did - that has GOT to be the neatest looking<br/>
city in the game!) so I&#39;m familiar with Nektulos. I&#39;m<br/>
just curious as to how much of a problem the Stone/Iron<br/>
guards are going to be.  Heh<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen Neriak yet, DO IT.</div>
