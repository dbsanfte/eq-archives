<div id="ygrps-yiv-921467286">I wouldn&#39;t classify enchanters as bossy by nature but as a result of how the<br/>
game works.  They know how their spells work and they also know firsthand<br/>
that if their group mates get stupid and attack mezzed mobs then the<br/>
enchanter has a good chance of dying.  If they have to resort to being bossy<br/>
to get the point across, then IMO its justified due to self-preservation.  I<br/>
do the same thing when I am in crowd control mode.  Back when Lullaby was<br/>
useful, I gave myself headaches trying to get everyone to attack the same<br/>
mob.  I&#39;ve lost count of the times I died because group mates attacked mobs<br/>
I was putting to sleep.  Hopefully, its a problem I will soon have to start<br/>
facing again:-)<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that every enchanter I&#39;ve grouped with, save one rather<br/>
friendly gnome, was the group leader.  They seem to lean towards the bossy<br/>
side.  One errant swing at a mezzed mob and you rapidly get the &quot;Everyone<br/>
needs to /assist or this will not work&quot; message.  Two swings seems to be the<br/>
tirade threshhold. ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This kind of brings me to another general question I wanted to throw<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How often do you bards take the role of group leader?  I think that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>group,<br/>
<br/>
I am almost never the one originally inviting or leading, because I hate<br/>
being leader.  Call me lazy or whatever, but I would really rather have<br/>
someone else do it, assuming there is a competent person who is willing. <br/>
However, my groups tend not to see it this way.  No matter how much I try<br/>
to take the back seat, if the original &quot;leader&quot; ever leaves, 10:1 they<br/>
all decide that I will be the new leader, no and&#39;s, if&#39;s, or but&#39;s about<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t claim to be very knowledgeable, or a great leader (though I<br/>
*do* tend to take charge in a power vacuum, ask my guild :P), so I can<br/>
only think of one reason groups seem to want me to lead--I know when to<br/>
leave well enough alone.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is a problem, I will happily fix it and I will gladly resolve<br/>
any conflicts or whatnot in a diplomatic way, but if there isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem and the group is running great, I keep my mouth shut and let<br/>
everyone have fun.  No one especially likes other people telling them<br/>
what to do, and when people are comfortable doing their jobs, the whole<br/>
group has a better time.  Not that I have not asked people to change<br/>
tactics in some cases, or even kicked out threats to the group in others,<br/>
but I think most people like a leader who is in that in-between<br/>
area--neither bossy and overbearing nor too timid if changes need to be<br/>
made.<br/>
