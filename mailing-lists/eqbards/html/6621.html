&gt;Well, if the guard is in the<br/>
&gt;water, you cannot kill a fish without the guard fighting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually you may pull it off if you&#39;re lucky.<br/>
When I went after my Koalindl fish, one of the paladins was swimming in the <br/>
far end of pool. I hit a fish and he jumped me,<br/>
so I zoned (at maybe 60% health) without killing the fish.<br/>
<br/>
Well stubborn me is not gonna give up because of this. Jumped in to the pool <br/>
again (Paladin still there), targeted the fish and backed up against the <br/>
steps leading out of the pool.<br/>
When the fish came within range again I hit it with a bellow, killed it when <br/>
it arrived and quickly looted. This time the Paladin did not attack me! <br/>
Still get the faction hit of course, I was lucky to get the drop at the <br/>
first attempt.<br/>
Try it at your own risk =)<br/>
<br/>
Of course all four Stein items turned No Drop on me before I could find my <br/>
trustworthy Enchanter so Im gonna try to finish the quest myself...wish me <br/>
luck lol.<br/>
