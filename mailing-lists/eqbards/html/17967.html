<div id="ygrps-yiv-957610479">I&#39;m level 38 now.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of 3 hours in the executioner&#39;s room in lower guk, I had a<br/>
total of 12 snares that lasted full duration. I noticed a huge amount of all<br/>
manner of froggies (wan, zol, tal, urd, nameds) break snare whenever they<br/>
felt like it. I would say 80% or more of the froggies were blue to me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m not talking about resists, I&#39;ve come to expect that, I&#39;m talking<br/>
about mobs breaking the effect early. Now I will say this, I don&#39;t know if<br/>
I&#39;m getting a message based on the attack slowdown portion or the movement<br/>
portion, but I&#39;m definitely seeing the &quot;Your Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain has worn<br/>
off&quot; message well before 3 ticks have gone by. I have log records of me<br/>
getting the &quot;Surrounded by chains of music message&quot; followed immediately (no<br/>
lines of combat text in between) by the &quot;worn off&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
I was always under the impression that if I could get our snare to stick it<br/>
was pretty reliable, now I&#39;m not so sure. I watched in horror as I got a<br/>
successful snare off, saw the worn off messages after a second or two and<br/>
then saw the froggie zooming off.<br/>

&gt; Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many<br/>
times<br/>
&gt; it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>
&gt; not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; powers that be.<br/>
<br/>
What level are you and what mobs are you using it on?  I&#39;ve<br/>
found it no less reliable in duration than our charm/fear/mez<br/>
songs.<br/>
