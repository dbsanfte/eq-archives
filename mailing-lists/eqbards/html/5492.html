<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485234011">I just found this site on EQVault and thought it might interest some of you.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how effective it really is but it seems like a nice way to<br/>
carry out offline (our of game) auctions for those of us who don&#39;t feel like<br/>
the hassle of camping for rare items or can&#39;t ever seem to make it to the<br/>
ingame Bazaar, or don&#39;t care to.<br/>
