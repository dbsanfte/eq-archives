<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086315991">Try a bracer of Erollosi which is +5 Str not sure of the AC.  It is lore but<br/>
it takes a nice exotic choice that ups your strength.  It is found in the<br/>
ocean of tears on a halfling on the island with the cyclops.  The island is<br/>
near the sisters island.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How tough is the halfling that carries the bracers?  Can a 21 bard solo him<br/>
or do I need some help?  Also, does he always drop them or is it random?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Galtin of E&#39;ci</div>
