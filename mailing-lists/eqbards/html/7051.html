<div id="ygrps-yiv-128569790">Hmm,<br/>
<br/>
I picked half-elf cuz of infa vis -  def u want to see at night - def!  Wood<br/>
elf will work there too.<br/>
<br/>
U gots armer to twink with?  What size?  If not twinking, then just thinking<br/>
ahead to what size u wanna wear - Halfies are stuck with med, woodies can<br/>
wear small or med - I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say STR is a major stat for bards.  It sets how much u can carry (which<br/>
will matter if u wear bronze plate) and how good your hits are (dmg).  You<br/>
can never have too much str in my book.<br/>
<br/>
Agi & Dex are important but have diminishing returns around 100 and these<br/>
seem to be easier to boost with items than Str.  These help determine how<br/>
often you hit (ie don&#39;t miss) and how good u can dodge (ie don&#39;t get hit.)<br/>
So these are important as well.<br/>
<br/>
Then Cha - rumored to be good for making songs &quot;stick&quot; (less resists) know<br/>
to be good for buying/selling.  Also easily boosted with items but figure 90<br/>
or 95 base un boosted and the the ez to buy silk evening tunic gets u +5 and<br/>
u r at 100. more items will be a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Wis & Int are least important in my book.  They determine mana and ability<br/>
to perform and learn skills.  You will have enough time to learn your skills<br/>
in melee combat so don&#39;t worry.<br/>

		I am about to start a new bard for a party of newbies me and<br/>
my freinds<br/>
		are going to make.  What would you guys reccomend?<br/>
Basically I have no<br/>
		idea what stats are important for the bard...<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;m leaning towards Wood Elf, but could be sold on Human or<br/>
half elf<br/>
		too...  (I just like how wood elves look)<br/>
