Cazic & Unrest are spots that you *could* go to and ones where you *need*<br/>
groups.  But it&#39;s also where you meet people who are just learning how to<br/>
group (unless they are second characters but you can usually tell from their<br/>
equipment.)  So, while you find groups, you will find some bad groups too.<br/>
Also, you are &quot;on the bottom of the food chain&quot; in these zones.  Meaning,<br/>
your level is low compared to the monsters and ther rest of the players.<br/>
It&#39;s also the first time you are meet mobs that hit really hard for their<br/>
level thus necessitating groups to fight them.  And being a bard, you dont<br/>
have a lot of hit points to stand toe-to-toe with them.  So, at level 20,<br/>
the risk is high.  If you go in the late 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s (heck, I even<br/>
dinged 39 there), you are stronger and more on top of the food chain.<br/>
<br/>
Other alternatives are:  Highkeep and Mistmoore.  Highkeep is popular and<br/>
probably crowded so you may need to pick different times of day to go there.<br/>
It requires groups (although you may see some solo fighters but they cant<br/>
hold a room solo). You can bind in the zone - its a city. Mistmoore is a<br/>
crazy place.  Lots of trains that are very rough.  But low levels have a<br/>
better chance here because there are spots off the train tracks (unlike<br/>
Cazic where the trains come right through the courtyard.)  If you can get a<br/>
group and camp along the wall behind the lake, you can pull mobs to you and<br/>
get good exp.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas for you,<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Cazic Advice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just became a newly minted Bard of 20 songs, and have read (a Cleric<br/>
&gt; guide, I believe) that I could start adventuring in Cazic.  The guide<br/>
listed<br/>
&gt; as one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>
&gt; group skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>
&gt; before with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>
&gt; level 20?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of<br/>
rogues<br/>
&gt; around, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>
&gt; the Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much.<br/>
