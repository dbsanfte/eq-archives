<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302963032"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; lvl bard can now use a 2 hand slashing weapon? did I remember it right that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Correct.  In order for us to acquire other more important traits<br/>
  in early beta, bards gave up two handed slashing.  All the bards<br/>
  made a big stink about it too.  Personally, I&#39;d rather wear plate<br/>
  and dual wield.  Just as the instrument pieces are still left over<br/>
  from an attempt to get bards to fuse their own instruments, so is<br/>
  the Two-Handed Slashing box at training in the Guild.  It&#39;s merely<br/>
  an icon of the past, so to speak.  You cannot train or raise skill<br/>
  in it.  We are forever stuck at ground zero.<br/>
<br/>
  (I would use the axe for looks tho, 2hs is kinda freaky on a bard)<br/>
  <br/>
  You would definitely stand out of the BRD crowd.  As for melee<br/>
  effectiveness, we dont have double attack (nor need it) so you<br/>
  would feel the strain of a 44 delay weapon at the lowest skill<br/>
  possible.<br/>
