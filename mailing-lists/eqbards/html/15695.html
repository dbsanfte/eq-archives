<div id="ygrps-yiv-333939931">You can NOT stick (or re-stick) charm until your pet breaks the previous<br/>
charm.  When he is your pet, he is immune to your offense songs, including<br/>
charm.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: charm, selos and move away.  Wait for the &quot;your charm is over...&quot;<br/>
message before you attempt to re-charm.  You can have selos up, see the<br/>
&quot;your charm has ended...&quot; message, cast new charm and while its casting -<br/>
take advanatge of a powerful bard thing and move away at selos speed thus<br/>
avoiding getting hit.  Ok, that works good in the karanas but not so good in<br/>
the sewers or other confined spaces but you get the idea: you can NOT<br/>
re-charm until after your pet breaks charm so move away.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve recently aquired the much coveted (by me at least) charm song. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>
&gt; get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>
&gt; something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s,<br/>
Hymn,<br/>
&gt; they back to charm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>
&gt; charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>
&gt; again. </span></blockquote></div>
