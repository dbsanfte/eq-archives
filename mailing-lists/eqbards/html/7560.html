in this.  How the h*ll does a bard die 4 times in one night<br/>
passing through outdoor zones?  I&#39;ve only been killed 2 times<br/>
since April while just &quot;passing through&quot; an outdoor zone since<br/>
April - a puma that could keep up with me killed me in my<br/>
weakened state after I&#39;d zoned from a random madman nuking me,<br/>
and the brownies in LFay nuked me before I could start moving.  <br/>
All my other outdoor deaths have been combat related.<br/>

I do totally agree with your above argument for non-bards that<br/>
can&#39;t bind, but then, giving bards bind doesn&#39;t really help<br/>
them.<br/>
