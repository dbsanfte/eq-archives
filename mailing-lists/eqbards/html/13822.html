&gt;Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start over?  I typed<br/>
&gt;in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t seen in a long<br/>
&gt;time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed in addition to<br/>
&gt;players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, or /groupsay but<br/>
&gt;instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the phrase I typed<br/>
&gt;to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire list, there are<br/>
&gt;a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made numerous attempts<br/>
&gt;at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces before I type<br/>
&gt;in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my friend list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ directory this will<br/>
&gt;delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
&gt;friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No - the friends list is stored in one of the OTHER .opt files. The <br/>
eqOptions1.opt file, in fact (just checked).  The galtin.opt file is <br/>
hotkeys only as near as I can tell.  You may want to try to get rid of<br/>
