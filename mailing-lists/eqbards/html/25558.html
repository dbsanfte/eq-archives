And just for the record, you can download the<br/>
patch long before the servers go up (it&#39;s one of<br/>
the first things they do) and read the patch<br/>
message... As far as when they&#39;ll come back up...<br/>
well, not to disillusion you or anything, but I<br/>
saw a supposed 5 hour patch last for 15 hours<br/>
before... Go take your dog for a walk or do some<br/>
laundry... the servers will be back up<br/>
eventually.<br/>
<br/>
And just so you know, I&#39;m friggin&#39; dying for them<br/>
to come back up myself... I&#39;ve had the Ring of<br/>
the Ancients for  days (since Halloween!!) and<br/>
haven&#39;t been able to get my Jboots because of the<br/>
zone changes to Rathe Mountains... So you&#39;re not<br/>
alone in your desire to play, you just need to<br/>
learn to cope...<br/>

&gt; &quot;When I was young, we had to wait DAYS for the<br/>
&gt; patch!  During prime <br/>
&gt; time!  In the rain (which you couldn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; through because the clip-plane <br/>
&gt; was broken!)  Uphill.  Both ways.  With no SoW!<br/>
&gt;  And for what?  Sure we had <br/>
&gt; zones - two of &#39;em. In black and white.  And<br/>
&gt; only one mob.  The mangy <br/>
&gt; rat.  People camped that rat for hours, and<br/>
&gt; every kill-stole from everyone <br/>
&gt; else.  Not that it mattered. The rat only had 1<br/>
&gt; copper for loot.  And since <br/>
&gt; everything cost at least a platinum, nobody<br/>
&gt; could afford any good <br/>
&gt; equipment.  Not that there was any good<br/>
&gt; equipment - just a rusty sword and <br/>
&gt; a moss-covered twig....&quot;<br/>
