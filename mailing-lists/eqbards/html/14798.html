<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259294229">When i was wandering in sol a with my bard, the first thing i would do upon<br/>
zoning in was tag the young gobbie in the entrance with Carillion.  It lasts<br/>
until you zone, and doesn&#39;t do anything *detrimental* so i pretty much do it in<br/>
every dungeon.  Keep in mind, that i have no idea if it helped or not, but it<br/>
might help some of you people who aren&#39;t lower level than the gobbies :)<br/>

Clanggedin Stoneskul, Dwarven Cleric of the 21st [something roughly equal to<br/>
&quot;level&quot;, but more roleplay-sounding]<br/>
&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>

&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
