 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I suspect we&#39;ve uncovered an unspoken detail.  I have noticed when I<br/>
use the keyboard to twist I can go too fast and not be able to start the<br/>
next because the previous hasn&#39;t quite finished.  That doesn&#39;t happen with<br/>
the mouse.  Sounds like the mouse has a built-in delay due to being less<br/>
responsive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a big Roger Wilco fan, too.  My gaming buddies and I have used it a lot<br/>
with Baldur&#39;s Gate.  We&#39;ve been trying to use it with EverQuest, but one<br/>
guy keeps having trouble that he can&#39;t transmit.  It&#39;s frustrating with<br/>
EverQuest because when Roger gets sick you have to completely leave EQ to<br/>
fix it.  Leading to:<br/>
<br/>
EverQuest has the most frustrating, baroque, complicated, step-filled,<br/>
ugly, memoryless way in and out of it that I&#39;ve had the displeasure of<br/>
using.  It clacks back and forth between screen resolutions, forces me to<br/>
interact in repetative, silly ways, takes way too long timing out on link<br/>
failures, and doesn&#39;t give me options for hurrying it along, such as a way<br/>
to break out of the timer when I&#39;m sure my link is dead.  It even gives me<br/>
a frustrating peek at my screen, showing me that the link has failed, then<br/>
goes through attempts and timeouts trying to get back to the login server<br/>
when it&#39;s completely hopeless, so I can click in three (!) different places<br/>
to make it go away and reconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Some things about EverQuest are outstanding.  Some are abysmal.  Obviously<br/>
the plusses outweigh the minusses for me, but oh, what it could be with<br/>
some of the easier minusses fixed....<br/>
