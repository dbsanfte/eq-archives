worst-case scenario explaining the song to my guild and was a<br/>
bit puzzled when a 100% resist rate (reapplication of the song<br/>
every 3 seconds) would take 8 minutes to deplete all my mana.  <br/>
(Putting aside for the moment any arguments about whether we<br/>
should even be using mana.)<br/>

From what I recall of the last spdata.eff parse, all our song<br/>
effects seemed to be listed sans instrument.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brings it in line with the high end enchanter MR buff.  They<br/>
still can&#39;t touch us with a magical drum.<br/>
