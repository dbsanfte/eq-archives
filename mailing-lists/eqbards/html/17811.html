 </span></blockquote>The mana cost needed to be increased.  I worked out a<br/>
worst-case scenario explaining the song to my guild and was a<br/>
bit puzzled when a 100% resist rate (reapplication of the song<br/>
every 3 seconds) would take 8 minutes to deplete all my mana.  <br/>
(Putting aside for the moment any arguments about whether we<br/>
should even be using mana.)<br/>

&gt; of Scale. Actually its not that much or a nerf and more of an insult heh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure the 75%/65% listed for us is without a drum.  <br/>
From what I recall of the last spdata.eff parse, all our song<br/>
effects seemed to be listed sans instrument.<br/>

&gt; Circle of Winter etc) all got raised to increase resist by 45 instead of 40<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Brings it in line with the high end enchanter MR buff.  They<br/>
still can&#39;t touch us with a magical drum.<br/>
