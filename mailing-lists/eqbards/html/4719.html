&gt; &gt;Has everyone else noticed that missed notes when starting a<br/>
&gt; &gt;song is now annoying frequent?  Not just with new songs<br/>
&gt; &gt;either, I&#39;m missing notes with low level songs like<br/>
&gt; &gt;Accelerando and Hymn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve noticed this too.. simple songs like Selo&#39;s and my level 16 bard is<br/>
&gt; having to make 4 tries to get it started.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even worse is the fact that on Veeshan right now for some reason or<br/>
&gt; another, people level 1-4 aren&#39;t spawning with Food, Water or their default<br/>
&gt; weapon after they die. Someone tell me how in the world a level 1-4 player<br/>
&gt; is supposed to advance with no weapon? I mean, the lack of food and water<br/>
&gt; is just an annoying &quot;Out Of&quot; message, but no weapon? Several bug reports<br/>
&gt; and petitions later and no response.<br/>
