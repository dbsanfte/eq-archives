&gt;         When you say &#39;VERY much sped up&#39; are you referring to some time in Beta or<br/>
&gt; currently? Someone I know who was a 35th level bard in Beta said 7 and 10<br/>
&gt; were broken and would give tremendous speed when played together but they<br/>
&gt; have been &#39;fixed&#39; to not double on the attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have heard bards claim that these two songs did not stack anymore, but I believe<br/>
they are wrong.  See the &quot;Crystal Numbers&quot; posting from yesterday.  Your attacks are<br/>
not doubled twice, but they do increase fairly significantly, and the songs do appear<br/>
to stack.<br/>
