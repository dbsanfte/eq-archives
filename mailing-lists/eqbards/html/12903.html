<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496507416">Ohh sure test it on the test server where you have complete controls and stealth nerfs over the last few down times.. can you say snowjob?  I knew you could.  Get him on a production server for Veeshan&#39;s sake.  What I would really like to see is a seperate bard verant guy because it&#39;s obvious where GZ&#39;s biases lie after his last several public posts.<br/>

&gt; I saw on the Concert Hall that GZ is setting up a meeting on the test<br/>
&gt; server for those who want to test out lullaby and pixie strike.  The<br/>
&gt; meeting is at the Qeynos newbie area at 3pm Pacific, however he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; leave a date as far as I saw.  If you&#39;re interested, you might want to<br/>
&gt; check out the Gameplay board at Sony to see if the date has been<br/>
&gt; posted.<br/>
