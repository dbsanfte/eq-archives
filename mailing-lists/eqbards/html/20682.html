<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112979173">Now why should I worry about that?  How many times am I going to DoT <br/>
myself :p  I meant as far as mobs DoTing you.  Besides, I think that <br/>
is what the problem was anyways.  People would DoT themselves and <br/>
then stack Regens.  Maybe they only changed it for self inflicted <br/>
DoT&#39;s?  Not sure.  All I am saying is, that you don&#39;t have to worry <br/>
about getting a DoT in combat and Hymn not counter acting it.<br/>

sing<br/>
&gt; hymn, the hymn icon will not appear until fufil&#39;s has worn off. <br/>
