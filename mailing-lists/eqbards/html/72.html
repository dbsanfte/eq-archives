<b>Subject:</b> Hail from Pistov of Cazic-Thule <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413599759">Hail, fellow bards.  I am Pistov, a 10th level Bard currently residing<br/>
in the metropolis of Freeport in the world of Cazic-Thule.  I have been <br/>
listening to all of the fine discussion by all, and like any bard worth<br/>
his lute strings, I have a few things to say as well.<br/>
<br/>
    First of all, regarding charging for locating a corpse, think of it<br/>
this way.  Bards, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers are the only classes <br/>
who have this talent.  Charging for this service seems a greedy and<br/>
selfish act, much more suited to those evil undead mongers, I would say.  <br/>
We as bards work best in a group, and the more friends we have the better.<br/>
Locating a corpse for free has made me many a travelling partner.  Coming<br/>
from one who was a wizard in a past life, it is FAR easier for us to sing <br/>
the song of speed and run in a straight heading to locate a corpse than it<br/>
is to wander around, lost, at a normal run searching fruitlessly.  <br/>
Performing this task for free gives all bards a good name.<br/>
<br/>
    Another thing I wanted to mention.  I myself tire of seeing a Dark Elf<br/>
Necromancer, a Troll Warrior, and a High Elf Paladin all in the same party.  <br/>
Please, try to role play at least a little.  Bards are well suited to<br/>
promoting role playing, since by our nature we are highly social.  It is <br/>
easy enough to make a few hotkeys that add a little flavor to the game.<br/>
Consider this:<br/>
<br/>
Pistov shouts, &#39;10 Bard wanting to join group for dervish hunting.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
Pistov shouts, &#39;I grow weary of singing to myself, I need an audience!  If<br/>
you would care to listen to a 10th level bard, please give a tell.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
    I guarantee you will have more success with the latter.  And it really<br/>
promotes good role playing.  We as bards should be good examples for others <br/>
to follow.  Try it, and I am sure you will begin to have much more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Fare well, all, and may the muses bless you!  Perhaps some of us may meet<br/>
some day!<br/>
<br/>
Pistov</div>
