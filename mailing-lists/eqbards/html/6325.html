<div id="ygrps-yiv-31594066">Well, i had used a slashing till i got dual wield, i then put a piercing in<br/>
my off hand, and now untill last night i used only piercing weapons, being<br/>
an ashenwood spear and a dirk.  Last night my friend handed me a Silvery war<br/>
axe (6/22, same as spear but half the weight).  So now im trying to get my<br/>
slashing back up to par from when i left it which was around 100 skill.<br/>
<br/>
But ya, most high level piercing weapons you can use are slashing...<br/>
the silvery axe<br/>

&gt; OK,<br/>
&gt; Here is my dilemma.  I created my bard as pretty much<br/>
&gt; a rogueish lad.  I tend to be drunk a LOT (yes, much<br/>
&gt; to the dismay of my friends, even in battle) and tease<br/>
&gt; EVERYBODY (my clan is SOOO sick of Limericks).  In<br/>
&gt; keeping with this, I have stuck to peircing weapons<br/>
&gt; since level 2 (where I found a nifty rusty spear).  I<br/>
&gt; am fairly well armed now, with a Dragoon Dirk and a<br/>
&gt; Combine Rapier (what I wouldn&#39;t give for an Ashenwood<br/>
&gt; Spear) and so far I LOVE my choice of weapons (Since I<br/>
&gt; NEVER seem to get into a group with more than one<br/>
&gt; tank...and usually that is me..I have fit into the<br/>
&gt; role of battle bard more than I&#39;d care to think<br/>
&gt; about).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My big question.  Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>
&gt; me at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>
&gt; weapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>
&gt; bards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>
&gt; roleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>
&gt; levels?  I really like the bard I created, as he is<br/>
&gt; SOOO different from the Cleric I had, and Im managing<br/>
&gt; to turn my guild into a bunch of drunks with me..hehe,<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t want to find out at level 3x that I should<br/>
&gt; have chosen to raise my 1h slash, as to do any decent<br/>
&gt; damage and be worth my wieght, I need to wield a<br/>
&gt; 1hSlash weapon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Work with me here folks, Im at work and sober (in game<br/>
&gt; and IRL)<br/>
