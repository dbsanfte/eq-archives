<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032596983"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ahhh, that&#39;s solved it then. Where abouts in Sol A does the Reckless<br/>
&gt; Efreeti spawn?? I know my way around quite well, wouldn&#39;t mind one of those<br/>
&gt; swords to trade with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The reckless efreeti spawns near the spear spike trap right outside<br/>
  the gnome area.  Facing the spear trap, turn left go into room with<br/>
  small set of stairs.  There should be a door here, lots of goblins <br/>
  inside.  At this point to the right of the door or thereabouts is<br/>
  a secret wall, which leads down to the Efreeti.  He is guarded by<br/>
  two lava elementals.  They have dmg shield that really hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  Alternately, you can walk past the spear spike trap, and hug left<br/>
  wall to fall through a false floor which drops you right on his<br/>
  head.<br/>
