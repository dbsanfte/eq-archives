&gt; engulfing darkness) I&#39;m not sure how much damage the engulfing darkness<br/>
&gt; does, but stat wise the EBW is better. So basically what I need are some<br/>

level rogue weapon drops, usually the only rogue there gets it<br/>
by default (this is especially true in the planes).  The EBW<br/>
is no-drop, so you&#39;re best off giving it to the person who&#39;ll<br/>
use it the longest.  That&#39;s more likely to be a bard due to<br/>
the current broken-ness of Hate (ranger and warrior weapons<br/>
drop pretty frequently in Fear).<br/>
