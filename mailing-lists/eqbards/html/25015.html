<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Back on-topic - &quot;Twisting&quot; songs... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-260250827">I used to be able to do four with my old chip (450) if I really tried hard<br/>
and had the clipping plane turned down as far as it would go, particle<br/>
effects off and looking at the ground/sky.  Now-a-days I can only do three.<br/>
 I have major packet loss and lag problems that only happen in game every<br/>
minute or so and traceroutes come up clean . . . go figure.  Anyhow I am<br/>
off topic *slap*.  I am sure if I didn&#39;t have the PL problems that I could<br/>
do four easily with the clipping plane turned down.  By the look of the<br/>
song gems un-graying at about half clipping plane distance I bet I could do<br/>
four if I concentrate and didn&#39;t have that damn lag.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I will only do three no matter what.  Four is just too much work.<br/>
I really don&#39;t have a way to optimize three songs.  As for four you really<br/>
have to stop and start the next song before you see the graphics and/or<br/>
text message of the previous song.<br/>
<br/>
My play list during battle depends on who is in the group and wether or not<br/>
I feel someone is competent to handle all the duties of their character.<br/>
So I really don&#39;t have a mainstay of songs.  Usually by the tenth or so<br/>
fight, I have swapped songs a couple times and can tell what the group<br/>
lacks.  After battle I am usually playing mana song(s) or HoR depending on<br/>
what the group needs.<br/>

&gt;&gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>
&gt;&gt;clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>
&gt;&gt;in viewable distance and twisting time.<br/>

&gt;Okay - to start another, on-topic, thread, I wanted to know a bit about <br/>
&gt;your success with &quot;twisting&quot; songs.<br/>
&gt;1) How many songs can you twist at once - assuming constant effect songs.<br/>
&gt;2) What do you do to optimize your twisting?<br/>
&gt;3) What is your current playlist?  What do you sing in battle, and what out <br/>
&gt;of it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just a few questions from a young-again bard<br/>
