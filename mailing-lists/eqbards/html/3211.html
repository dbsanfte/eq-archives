<div id="ygrps-yiv-335838590">I do not think you have ever used a tomahawk so you do not know it bad side<br/>
effects.  I have a stam of 65, which make me slow down a lot after 2 fight<br/>
in a row.  If there is a third mob I am dead for.  But with claw I have<br/>
fought 4 barbed skeleton in Unrest and still have stam left over.  Second<br/>
thing, even though the proc give you a shield of 50-150hp, but with the mob<br/>
that I hunt at lvl 22 they can do more than the average dmg to me which goes<br/>
through the shield but when I used the claw I find that I get hit very<br/>
little.  As I increase in lvl the mob will hit a lot harder and I need all<br/>
the agi I can get.  Third, the weapon is very slow compared to the Claw.  I<br/>
hit like 4 times per melee without the dual wield.  In the end the dmg is<br/>
the same or better and it helps a lot against magic users which most of the<br/>
mob that u hunt at high lvl used magic.  This is my personal preference.  I<br/>
think the guy I traded it with was very happy with the trade and so was I<br/>
and I can always get another tomahawk at my lvl rather than wait till lvl 30<br/>
to get a claw.<br/>

My god trading a tomhawk for a claw?! WTF is that. I could never trade<br/>
my tomhawk for a claw. The market isn&#39;t flooded with em on Solusek Ro,<br/>
but a tommy for a demon claw is something that wouldn&#39;t happen here. I<br/>
can&#39;t even find a worthwhile trade for my tommy anywhere on antonica.<br/>
Anychance the guy who you traded with has a seperate character on<br/>
Solusek Ro I could trade with, cause I&#39;d be VERY happy to do business.<br/>
