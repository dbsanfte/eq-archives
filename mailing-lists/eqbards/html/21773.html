<div id="ygrps-yiv-465356836">That was the most pathetic excuse for a response I have ever seen.  How many<br/>
times did GZ personally assure us that the Practice Lute and Small Brass<br/>
Trumpet were in game?  At least once in my presence in full view of many<br/>
others at the infamous &quot;snake testing&quot;.  Obviously bards just aren&#39;t a &quot;high<br/>
priority&quot; for anything.  We aren&#39;t casters so who cares... obviously no one<br/>
at Verant.<br/>

apparently many of our songs are &quot;working as intended&quot; or &quot;may need to be<br/>
re-evaluated at some point&quot;<br/>
<br/>
this may be the end for me.<br/>
