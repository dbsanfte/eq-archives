<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836261132"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One of my best friends, RL, is a lvl 50 bard on Solusek Ro. I KNOW how<br/>
&gt; much effort she put in to get there. ALL last year. I also know I am<br/>
&gt; not willing to put that kind of time into the game. I do not envy the level<br/>
&gt; 50s, though I do feel left out on occasion. I realize that is, indeed, a<br/>
&gt; matter<br/>
&gt; of how much effort they were willing to put into the game, in comparison.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I do know that I am unsure about /tell&#39;ing people that<br/>
&gt; high, unless I know them in particular. Because I do not want<br/>
&gt; to be seen as one of those annoying lower levels always bothering,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
