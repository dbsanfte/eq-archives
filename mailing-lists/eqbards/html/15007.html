 </span></blockquote>If you read the testing and data I got, you&#39;ll see I put<br/>
enough work in it that there is no room for discussion.  It is<br/>
not subjective, it is completely objective, with I&#39;d guess<br/>
about 99.99% certainty, proof that Lullaby is indeed broken.  <br/>
When I put it together, I wanted it to be irrefutable and took<br/>
steps to cover ever contingency I could think of (which is why<br/>
there&#39;s no room for discussion - I&#39;ve already addresses any<br/>
issues anyone may want to discuss :).  There are other posts<br/>
with fair to good statistical data, but there&#39;s lots of<br/>
discussion on them beccause the results are not as clear.  <br/>
Not trying to sound egotistical, but it is the most<br/>
technically and statistically solid post I&#39;ve ever seen on<br/>
that board.  If Verant wants to ignore it... well, I would<br/>
interpret that as a statement from Verant that they don&#39;t care<br/>
about a bug that renders one of a class&#39; primary abilities<br/>
(crowd control) virtually useless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for the patch and until Thursday (1 business week)<br/>
for a reply.  If there is none, I&#39;ll email it to the folks at<br/>
castersrealm to see if they can elicit a response.<br/>
