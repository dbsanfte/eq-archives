<div id="ygrps-yiv-815311425">Harmony was not fixed until early final.  Sometime around June.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s likely that he played during beta (where we all learned to do without<br/>
Harmony and a few other spells that were broken/not implemented at the<br/>
time.).  Because of this he may just never have bothered learning it when he<br/>
got the chance in final.  Or he asked friends who played during beta and was<br/>
told &quot;It&#39;s broken, don&#39;t bother&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I myself fell victim to the &#39;beta mentality&#39; and when my ranger had the<br/>
chance to get harmony at 15 never used it until my mid 20&#39;s.... go figure.<br/>
Once I realized it actually worked I was thrilled.  To top all that off most<br/>
of the sites listing spell effects were just cloning older lists made during<br/>
beta.  None reflected that harmony worked correctly (nor what it did) until<br/>
late summer.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of funny.<br/>

&gt; Really?  I&#39;ve been using harmony successfully for months.  How could he<br/>
fail<br/>
&gt; to find out it worked for that long?  when did it get fixed?<br/>

&gt; Note: For the longest time, Harmony did absolutely nothing and was<br/>
&gt; worthless at a spell. I bought it because I am a completist and I<br/>
&gt; wanted everything. At some time, they did a &quot;silent de-nerf&quot; and<br/>
&gt; made Harmony more than do something -- but actually be WORTH<br/>
&gt; using. It is possible, if he doesn&#39;t read the net, this druid<br/>
&gt; tried Harmony/heard from like levels that it was worthless and<br/>
&gt; thus never actually bought it... and has not been doing outside<br/>
&gt; stuff with groups since that someone mentioned &quot;Hey, Harmony<br/>
&gt; -works- now&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;hehehe ok i like this topic... here is one for you all.  in butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt;killing dwarven citizens (it&#39;s cheesy but easy, hey that rhymes) i met a<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 40 druid.  he asked me to help him split up 2 dwarves who were<br/>
&gt; &gt;together.  it seemed strange being a druid and all, so i just said use<br/>
&gt; &gt;harmony.  he said: &quot;i&#39;m gonna go buy it.&quot;<br/>
