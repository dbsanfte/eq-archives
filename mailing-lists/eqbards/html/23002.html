<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029118774">You can also put level ranges /who warrior 30 60 all count<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend you decide a level range.  I think a lot of people start a<br/>
twink and decide they don&#39;t like it etc.  This is especially true for the<br/>
harder classes (PARTICULARLY Bards) where they get to a certain level - and<br/>
give up...  I know a lot of people that say &quot;Wow Bards are cool - I&#39;m gonna<br/>
start a bard twink&quot;.  And they get to the low teens - but then I never see<br/>
them playing it again.<br/>

Awesome!  I didn&#39;t know about that option.  I&#39;ll start recording stats<br/>
during prime-time and see what shakes out.  I was concerned that off-peak<br/>
hours might skew numbers towards more soloable classes, until I saw how many<br/>
enchanters there were :-o<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never met anyone who could solo an enchanter after 20th level.<br/>

Kit - you forgot you can do a &quot;/who warrior all count&quot; and get just the<br/>
count - without worrying about the list cutoff.  You can do this during<br/>
primetime and get better statistics.<br/>

        Warriors                32+     too many to list<br/>
        Rogues          9.5<br/>
        Monks                   5.5<br/>
        Rangers         30<br/>
        Paladins                27<br/>
        Shadowknights   17.5<br/>
        Bards                   5<br/>
        Wizards         19.25<br/>
        Magicians               29.75<br/>
        Necromancers    32+     too many to list<br/>
        Enchanters              25+     One night there were too many to<br/>
list<br/>
        Clerics         31+     Two nights there were too many to list<br/>
        Druids          32+     too many to list<br/>
        Shamans         23.75<br/>
<br/>
        With over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>
server was      Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those classes<br/>
which were too many     to list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>
number.<br/>
