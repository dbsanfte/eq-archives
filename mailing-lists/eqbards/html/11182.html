&gt; loss of mana regen, as the clarity song will pulse every 6 to 7 seconds <br/>
&gt; depending on your manual dexterity, computer&#39;s framerate, and missed notes.  <br/>
&gt; You can even weave it with to songs and still get nearly the same effect <br/>
&gt; like this:  Song1 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song2 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song1 -&gt; Clarity, etc...<br/>

it&#39;s effectiveness?<br/>
