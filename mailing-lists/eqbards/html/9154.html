&gt;I haven&#39;t played any other class except a bard so I&#39;m not familiar with all<br/>
&gt;the spells out there.  Do other classes have spells that can accidently<br/>
&gt;cause damage to them like the Dirge can for bards?  <br/>

he uses his Mesmerization (Equivalent to our Lullaby). If not, he<br/>
accidentally mesmerizes himself.  It&#39;s funny because sometimes he&#39;ll just<br/>
be standing there, and someone will comment &quot;Whassa matter?  Goin&#39; to sleep<br/>
on us?&quot; and he&#39;ll reply just as soon as he can, &quot;As a matter of fact, yes!&quot;<br/>
