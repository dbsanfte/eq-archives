<div id="ygrps-yiv-443360809">The worst part about this is that they haven&#39;t even<br/>
informed anyone via login or on their website that<br/>
they downloaded the infected files.  So anyone who<br/>
doesn&#39;t read these boards may not even know they are<br/>
infected.  This is highly irresponsible of Verant.  I<br/>
sent an email to gordon--I assume his is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gwrinn@...">gwrinn@...</a>.  I have not heard back.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
posted to the gameplay forum on the everquest site.  <br/>
<br/>
The least they can do is inform everyone that they may<br/>
have a virus on their machine so they can clean it. <br/>
The virus is fairly benign but it is still inexcusable<br/>
to not let the public know that they may be infected. <br/>
Re-patching will not help if you have already opened<br/>
the files because the virus will propagate to other<br/>
doc files on your system.<br/>

&gt; It is important that you know that the Ruins of<br/>
&gt; Kunark CD *may* have <br/>
&gt; included a Word Macro virus embedded in the new<br/>
&gt; documents.  If so, here is <br/>
&gt; the information on the virus:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I say &quot;may&quot; because it&#39;s possible that the<br/>
&gt; infected file came from the <br/>
&gt; patch center.  In either case, Abashi has stated<br/>
&gt; that if you didn&#39;t open <br/>
&gt; the doc file, you are fine.  If you did, you are SOL<br/>
&gt; - Verant is keeping <br/>
&gt; mum about a solution.  Of course, you should always<br/>
&gt; have a virus scanner <br/>
&gt; running (says the guy without one) and never open<br/>
&gt; anything from someone you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know and/or trust (yadda yadda).  Thanks for<br/>
&gt; shooting THAT one in the <br/>
&gt; foot, Verant :P.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck to you RoK&#39;ers - I&#39;m not able to upgrade,<br/>
&gt; so I won&#39;t be seeing <br/>
&gt; you there.<br/>
