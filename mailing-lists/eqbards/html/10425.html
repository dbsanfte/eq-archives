<div id="ygrps-yiv-632763114">DDD gives you just the &quot;blahblah winces&quot; message like CoD- but it is VERY<br/>
powerful! Make sure you put at least one point into your brass skill when<br/>
you train (i put a all I could as soon as I could) because it does take a<br/>
bit to fire up this song when you first start using it. I did ask a high<br/>
level bard what the best thing to do to max the song out was and he said go<br/>
to freeport newbie area... it did help, then I used it in EC in the easier<br/>
area and that helped, finally I got too impatient, so I just started using<br/>
it along with the other two (CoD and Hymn) and in 5 days it went from 30 or<br/>
40something to it being in the 70s now - can&#39;t wait until it catches the<br/>
rest of my instruments! One of the things I have found was that I&#39;ve started<br/>
using more than just the basic hotkey setups too - I have one for melee with<br/>
the inventory and melee slots - and one for songs (those two I use together<br/>
when grouping where I don&#39;t want to pull lots of things with the DDD/CoD<br/>
songs)- but I also have one that has DDD/CoD/Hymn AND a melee slot with two<br/>
inventory slots - where I switch the horn with the lute and have the drum<br/>
handy in case I need to run....<br/>
