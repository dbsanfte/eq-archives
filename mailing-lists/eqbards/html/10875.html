<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073978938">I believe they are live froggies that got stuck with the bad job of having<br/>
to hang out on the dead side.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Having read all the posts recently about getting cool stuff down in Guk, I<br/>
made my way there using an assortment of maps and directions and finally<br/>
found the entrance everyone&#39;s been talking about. Sure enough the floor was<br/>
littered with the corpses of dead players, but no dead Shin Knight corpses.<br/>
<br/>
I am a patient bard, as well as one that was invis and feeling quite safe,<br/>
so I sat down and waited for the dreaded trains to come bringing piles of<br/>
loot.<br/>
<br/>
5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I got up and walked down to where the north-south hall<br/>
starts.. &quot;Ah a dead froggie!&quot; I loot and get some gold, but nothing else.<br/>
While I am looting another Shin Knight spawns and takes no notice of me<br/>
while I am invis or visible. I tell a friend who is familiar with Guk asking<br/>
him if I am indeed in the right spot and if people really do train stuff<br/>
here. He confirms on both issues, so I head back to zone border and wait.<br/>
<br/>
5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>
<br/>
I do a &quot;/who&quot; and see that indeed there are many people here, over 60 at<br/>
that point. I also realize that I am the only player here under level 30. A<br/>
small shiver overtakes me.<br/>
<br/>
I start to wander down to the north-south hall again, two Shin Knights are<br/>
now there but no one is taking them on. I decide to head south towards the<br/>
river/stream to see if anyone has left something down there. I turn the<br/>
first corner to start heading east/south east when I see a dead froggie. At<br/>
first he does nothing to me, so I &quot;/con&quot; him and it says he&#39;s ready to<br/>
attack, and to boot he&#39;s close enough. Just then as I am thinking how<br/>
fortunate I am that he&#39;s ignored me, &quot;BAM!&quot; he hits, no too hard, but since<br/>
he was dark red to me I make my dash back and zone. I also decide once I<br/>
have zoned that maybe I will come back another time and head back to<br/>
Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, did I just hit Lower Guk on a bad night, or do I just<br/>
need to be more patient? This being a vulture stuff is hard :)<br/>

&gt; Yes, I guess that they are &quot;live&quot; froggies - but my froggie faction is<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; gone and they agro me.  Unless I fade a little (invis to undead) then they<br/>
&gt; do not agro as I go by - I don&#39;t stand around waiting though.  So, I<br/>
guessed<br/>
&gt; that they were un-dead since they dint agro when I was invised-to-undead.<br/>
&gt; Live, ded, unded?  3 distinct categories?<br/>

&gt; The regular Shin Knight Frogs are live.  They totally ignore<br/>
&gt; me when I stand<br/>
&gt; right in front of them totally visible.  Shin Ghouls on the<br/>
&gt; other hand make<br/>
&gt; me run like a cry baby the instant they smell me.<br/>
