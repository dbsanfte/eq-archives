<div id="ygrps-yiv-104706399">Well, because BBB can be sung more often, and doesn&#39;t drain mana.  Which is why DDD should, if<br/>
single-target, do a lot more damage than BBB does.<br/>
<br/>
BBB isn&#39;t resisted as much as you might expect, it seems to work about 60% of the time for me even against<br/>
big MOBs.<br/>

&gt; i don&#39;t see a point to memming that song either.  i can interrupt a caster<br/>
&gt; with SoT, and if it is 55+ where SoT wouldn&#39;t work, then BBB is going to be<br/>
&gt; resisted anyway.<br/>
