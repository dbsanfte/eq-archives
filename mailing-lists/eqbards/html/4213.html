<div id="ygrps-yiv-219196982">I think his point was on a place such as a mailing list, where people are<br/>
going for information about the game, seeing acronyms is a little confusing.<br/>
Just like words as &#39;twink&#39;, &#39;kite&#39;, &#39;twist&#39;, &#39;proc&#39;, new members to the list<br/>
and to EQ do not know what they mean.  The same with acronyms.  If you are<br/>
in the game and using acronyms its fine - you are usually in a hurry or<br/>
lazy.  But it isn&#39;t too much to ask to use the full words on an<br/>
informational list such as this.  I know it took me about a week to figure<br/>
out what a BIBS was and I have been playing since the end of March.  <br/>
<br/>
Just for an example, I have LBA,  LG, and DBBA for sell.  Do you know what I<br/>
am talking about?  No - go to this page and look it up then :)<br/>

&gt; Hahaha...too funny, I have never met anyone who was on a crusade against<br/>
&gt; acronyms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a game where people communicate in real-time and many of us do not<br/>
&gt; type 80 words per minute.  If someone uses the acronym &quot;RTS&quot; instead of<br/>
&gt; typing out &quot;Runed Totem Staff&quot; I really think they should be forgiven.<br/>
&gt; After all, if you don&#39;t know what RTS is all you have to do is ask someone<br/>
&gt; once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only double-meaning acronym in the game I know of is &quot;BB&quot; - one for<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock and one for Blackburrow, but you generally do not get<br/>
&gt; confused<br/>
&gt; because usage is mostly in context. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well...I shouldn&#39;t have been lured off topic but I could not resist<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; stupefied by this rant, which has come up before much to my disbelief.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ah! You just need the secret decoder ring. Here ya go:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry, wrong answer.  Doesn&#39;t scale.  Barely works at all.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Using acronyms<br/>
&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an <br/>
&gt; &gt; immense list of<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered <br/>
&gt; &gt; to type out<br/>
&gt; &gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM <br/>
&gt; &gt; systems difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are <br/>
&gt; &gt; even worse than<br/>
&gt; &gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; fly, then use<br/>
&gt; &gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get <br/>
&gt; &gt; the point and<br/>
&gt; &gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in <br/>
&gt; &gt; secret code,<br/>
&gt; &gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; &gt; communicating<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if <br/>
&gt; &gt; the majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t bother to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>
