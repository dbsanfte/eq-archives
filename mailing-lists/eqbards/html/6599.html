<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770580035">Heh heh, no I do think its hopeless now.  That&#39;s not the part I find funny,<br/>
its just that everyone who says its hopeless also says they are afraid to go<br/>
there.  I would think it is would be desireable that they&#39;d be afraid to go<br/>
there but that they would go anyway and have some reasonable chance of<br/>
survival.  The idea that groups could go off and wantonly kill a &#39;od like<br/>
Cazic Thule struck me as silly as in the old days of D&D some kEwL DoOd<br/>
would show up for a game with his own personal Mjolnir that he &#39;ripped&#39; from<br/>
Thor&#39;s cold dead fingers.  &#39;ods should kill you, by the dozens.  If every<br/>
great hero in the land showed up and laid into the guy then maybe he should<br/>
die, but not without a lot of company.  Just my personal opinion of course<br/>
and I&#39;ll leave it at that and save Talies the &#39;KABONG&#39;<br/>

&gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider it<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for those<br/>
&gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.  It<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a new<br/>
&gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>
want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>
cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>
and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>
effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>
