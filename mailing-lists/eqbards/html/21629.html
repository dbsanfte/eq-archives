<div id="ygrps-yiv-933307797">Huh?  you are essentially locked out from attacking while casting a spell.  except<br/>
for bards.  i doubt it has anything to do with the animation, the game actually<br/>
is programmed so you can&#39;t attack while you are casting a spell.   note that<br/>
on a few of the songs we have, we do the full casting animation as well and it<br/>
in no way affects our attacks.<br/>

&gt;I know this doesn&#39;t affect bards since we can&#39;t use bows, but something<br/>
&gt;Abashi said raises a question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was never aware that primary and secondary attacks were delayed after<br/>
&gt;casting a spell.  In other words, you temporarily stop swinging for X number<br/>
&gt;of seconds after casting a spell.  X is the your weapon DLY/10.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So does this affects bards?  We are constantly weaving songs so do we also<br/>
&gt;stop swinging for X amount of seconds after our songs start?  I&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt;really noticed it myself so am inclined to believe this does not affect us.<br/>
&gt;Can someone confirm?<br/>
