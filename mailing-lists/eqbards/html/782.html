&gt; races before and after and with SOW there doesn&#39;t seem to be as much speed<br/>
&gt; lost to encumberance (almost none as a matter of fact), while Selo&#39;s shows a<br/>

I stack the Whistling Warsong and/or Chant of Battle and/or<br/>
the Anthem with Selo&#39;s.  That usually gets my strength up high<br/>
enough that I&#39;m not encumbered anymore.  Best option though is<br/>
usually to give all your heavy stuff to a mage and let him<br/>
gate to town while you run.<br/>
