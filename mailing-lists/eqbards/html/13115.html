<br/>
				  Well, I didn&#39;t get to test much stuff, but<br/>
I made observations.<br/>
				  And I have a screenshot as well.  Anyway,<br/>
the observations.<br/>
<br/>
				  My equipment:<br/>
<br/>
				  Icy greaves, Froglok Crown, Vox Bracer (i<br/>
gave one away), 2 <br/>
				  Peridot plat rings, Runed Bone Fork, Cloak<br/>
of the Ice bear,<br/>
				  Imbrued Boots, misc Lambent bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
				  Total cold base:      119<br/>
				  Total cold w/ spell:  159<br/>
				  Total cold w/ song:   222<br/>
<br/>
				  Reso, SoW, Naltron. (~2000 hp)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				  You are blasted by freezing winds.  ~800<br/>
hp poof, gone.<br/>
				  I&#39;d have to estimate the other tanks in<br/>
the group were taking the <br/>
				  same breath weapon damage, with only 140<br/>
total cold.  Take that<br/>
				  as you may.<br/>
<br/>
				  What did make the difference was two<br/>
clerics chain group healing.<br/>
				  And while I still speculate that the<br/>
random generator&#39;s involvement<br/>
				  in how much breath damage you take is<br/>
large, I can assert that it<br/>
				  doesn&#39;t hurt to beef up your cold, if<br/>
nothing more than to show off.  <br/>
				  (I had the highest base cold there)<br/>
<br/>
				  Bard Dragon Tactic Observations:<br/>
<br/>
				  * Never face the dragon.  This cuts visual<br/>
lag by 50% easy.<br/>
				    And before you say upgrade your<br/>
computer, I have a P3-450<br/>
				    with a Diamond V770 32MB TNT2 Ultra<br/>
video card in 640x480<br/>
				    no graphic options on... It was laggy,<br/>
Period.<br/>
<br/>
				  * Twisting is almost impossible, you have<br/>
to count and twist<br/>
				    in order to get the songs running.  If<br/>
you wait for the visual<br/>
				    or textual cue, it&#39;s too late.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t face the dragon,<br/>
				    twisting is a helluva lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
				  * I did not melee, otherwise I was asking<br/>
the dragon to kill me.<br/>
				    I stayed out of dragon melee range, and<br/>
in my party&#39;s song <br/>
				    radius range.  Vox never melee&#39;d me<br/>
once, although one giant<br/>
				    that spawned kept freaking bashing my<br/>
song off.  Annoying.<br/>
				    Although Vox was moving around a lot, I<br/>
had to compensate to.<br/>
<br/>
				  These all may be due to the number of<br/>
people and the place Vox<br/>
				  was pulled to.  Tight quarters and lots of<br/>
people never goes<br/>
				  well with EQ.  It never has since beta.<br/>
<br/>
				  I followed pretty much what everyone here<br/>
said to do.  The battle<br/>
				  was fairly smooth I suppose.  If you call<br/>
throwing 48 people at a<br/>
				  dragon, smooth.  heh.  Only a few people<br/>
died, I don&#39;t know why<br/>
				  or under what circumstances, but two of<br/>
the melee groups had no<br/>
				  bard, and they did just fine.  The rogue<br/>
died I know, after throwing<br/>
				  a few BS&#39;s in.  And a couple of tanks who<br/>
weren&#39;t getting the proper<br/>
				  healing, too.  No one in my group died, or<br/>
LD&#39;d - thank god.<br/>
<br/>
				  I expected to cut 50-75% AE breath weapon,<br/>
and I didn&#39;t notice<br/>
				  any big difference between 220ish cold and<br/>
140ish cold.<br/>
<br/>
				  Screenshots (will only be up for a bit, if<br/>
someone wants to copy<br/>
				               the Vox one somewhere else<br/>
they can):<br/>
