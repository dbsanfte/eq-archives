<div id="ygrps-yiv-233159770">Dear brothers and sisters: <br/>
<br/>
As I wander the land of Norrath, battle creatures, and gain experience, I<br/>
often hear voices whisper things to me like &quot;You hit a Skeleton for 15<br/>
damage&quot; or &quot;A Gnoll tries to pierce you, but misses&quot;. As I gain more and<br/>
more skill, my mind wonders what all of these whispers mean, and how they<br/>
are derived. <br/>
<br/>
I am not an experienced RPGer. I have played UO, and I have played EQ. I<br/>
have never played any other MUD, any 1 player RPG computer game, or<br/>
anything like D&D. There seems to be the expectation in EQ that you know<br/>
what things like Dexterity, Agility, Strength, Armor Class, etc. are for<br/>
and what they affect. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, items that boost these numbers by very very small amounts are<br/>
expensive, and make me wonder why I should spend 5 plat on armor that<br/>
increases my AC by 2%, or 1 plat on a ring that gives me 2 extra Dex. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who can answer any of the following questions please do so. I would<br/>
be very grateful, for I am getting very frusrated with the fact that<br/>
everyone else in the game seems to know what is going on, and I do not. <br/>
<br/>
What does strength affect in combat? What does dexterity affect in combat?<br/>
What does agility affect in combat? Are jewelry or other enhancements that<br/>
add only 1 or 2 to these stats really worth it? Do they really make a<br/>
difference, and how do you know? <br/>
<br/>
What is armour for? Does it absorb damage? Or is it figured into whether<br/>
you actually get hit? Or both? <br/>
What does the AC value of armor actually mean? Does adding 3 or 4 to your<br/>
AC actually make a difference? <br/>
<br/>
What is the ATK stat that goes up with each level? <br/>
<br/>
Every weapon has a delay. How long is the delay is seconds? <br/>
<br/>
There are several combat skills. One is for your weapon type (i.e. 1H<br/>
slahsing) and there are others for offense and defense. What are each <br/>
of these for? When do they get figured in? <br/>
<br/>
When I use my weapon, I hit for 17 damage per turn. No more. This hasn&#39;t<br/>
changed since I first got the weapon (4 levels ago) and doesn&#39;t change when<br/>
my 1H slashing, offense, strength, or dexterity goes up. Why don&#39;t these<br/>
stats affect what damage I can inflict? <br/>
<br/>
I miss a lot. Up to 8 times in a row sometimes. Because of this, creatures<br/>
thay /con blue often win the battle. What can I do to miss less? <br/>
Is there any documentation anywhere that shows the numbers game? In UO the<br/>
player guide simply had things like WeaponDmage * Skill + 10 = Damage. That<br/>
would be very useful to me. Does it exist anywhere? <br/>
<br/>
Again, if you know the answer to even one of these, please post! Thanks! <br/>
