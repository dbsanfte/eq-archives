<div id="ygrps-yiv-209739637"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mccomb@...">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>
&gt;Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
&gt;shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.  <br/>
&gt;My questions: <br/>
&gt;At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>
&gt;be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	At lvl 7 you are probably still struggling a little bit.  There is a<br/>
huge difference between lvl 7 and lvl 8 and that is your lvl 8 song, Kelin&#39;s<br/>
Lament.  This spell lets you split up groups of mobs and is probably the<br/>
best spell you get before 15th level at least other than Selo&#39;s Accelerando.<br/>
You will find with this spell you will be able to tackle spawn spots that<br/>
others cannot begin to at your level.  Nothing is more satisfying than<br/>
running over to the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark, finding 2-3 9-10th levels<br/>
siting there pondering whether or not they have any chance to take out the<br/>
camp.  You join the group, split up the camp so you can fight it once at a<br/>
time and you&#39;ve made an impossible task very doable.  Other than pursuing<br/>
8th lvl I&#39;d concentrate on getting your 3 weapon types all maxed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>
&gt;makes the bard fun?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would I...  Well, probably not but that is due to my playing restrictions as<br/>
much as anything.  Let&#39;s face it, Everquest is a caster&#39;s world plain and<br/>
simple.  If I log on with my bard and the gang I play with is 4-5 zones away<br/>
or on another continent, at 21st level I sigh and usually just hang out a<br/>
little while and log off.  If I am playing my druid, its no problem I just<br/>
teleport over and am there very quickly, knowing I can get back for tomorrow<br/>
night&#39;s group equally quickly.  Gate and the ability to Bind anywhere make<br/>
it so much easier to play the game when you can usually only play for about<br/>
2 hrs a night immeasureably better.  Unfortunately the way the game is now I<br/>
just don&#39;t think any of the hybrid or melee classes get anything that even<br/>
begins to recompense them for the lack of those two abilities.  Not as far<br/>
as play enjoyment goes anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
What makes my bard fun is the roleplaying aspect.  I roleplay a bard.  I<br/>
have considered playing my Shaman again, going and getting a Mandolin (so I<br/>
can look the part) and just role-playing him as a bard.  There are bard<br/>
abilities I find immensely fun.  Hymn and Lament were two songs that made<br/>
being a bard tons of fun.  Unfortunately the further I got from Lament, the<br/>
more I felt like my new songs weren&#39;t providing me much enjoyment and<br/>
weren&#39;t enough to keep up with the growing difficulties I faced.  Still<br/>
playing my bard is fun, though I doubt I could bear to do it all over again<br/>
now that I&#39;ve seen how much easier it is for casters.  My bard has died more<br/>
times than my 5 other characters have put together.  My 8th level shaman<br/>
never died after 4th level.<br/>
