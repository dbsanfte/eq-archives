<div id="ygrps-yiv-715504567">casting and weaving are similar, but not identical. all meleeing caster<br/>
types (RAN, SHD, PAL mainly) are cursed with the delay to get back to<br/>
swinging after a cast spell... i have NEVER noticed any type of delay of any<br/>
sort with my bard while weaving.. weaving 3 songs in any given battle would<br/>
allow you to swing so very few times if this was the case for us, rendering<br/>
our battling skills (for what they&#39;re worth) useless.<br/>
<br/>
on another note... has anyone started their epic quest? or a better question<br/>
yet, has anyone attempted to give Maligar the note to him? well seeing he&#39;s<br/>
kos, it makes it a challenge. i figured i&#39;d just kill him and he&#39;d drop his<br/>
head anyway. boy was i wrong... 3 times. (20min spawn so it wasn&#39;t so bad<br/>
trying over)  anyway, a druid guildmate and i were dotting the junk out of<br/>
him and he died with relative ease, other than blinding us to no end, and<br/>
fearing us all over WK... ok, the first time we tried it was a dot, snare<br/>
charm approach. we&#39;d both dot, she&#39;d snare, and i charmed to keep him from<br/>
casting on us during the times where he was dot&#39;ed. well at one point in the<br/>
battle, we were both blinded, and i was too far from him to determine what<br/>
health he had remaining, so i commenced to charm him again. just as i did,<br/>
she said in group &quot;DIE&quot;... well little did i know he had just a sliver left.<br/>
so he died. of course while under charm spell.. argh body poofed. no biggie.<br/>
we waited for respawn. tried again by just dotting, worked well, well still<br/>
dropped no head. so the 3rd time i decided, maybe he needs this note to<br/>
cough up the head. she harmonied him and i walked up to give him the note.<br/>
he didn&#39;t say a word as i recall. just proceeded to attack as always. i<br/>
thought well he has the note now, he&#39;ll give the head for sure... yeah ok..<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
so now i have no note (not impossible to get again, just not worth it)...<br/>
but was wondering if you need to have him under charm,like gix in commons,<br/>
to get the note for thex mallet quest.  if anyone has the note, or is about<br/>
to get it, inform us of your success, not a carbon copy of this =)<br/>
