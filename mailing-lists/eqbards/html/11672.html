<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891919965">I got the same email reply Jason.  I&#39;d agree with everything you said below<br/>
except that there is no iterative effect on Lullaby.  I tested it for over<br/>
an hour of straight and the % of false nods did not decrease over time.  It<br/>
appears they have some sort of ignore mez code built in in order to reduce<br/>
its effectiveness against higher level creatures.  My guess is that<br/>
particular piece of code is not functioning properly.<br/>

Yesterday I wrote an email to Geoffrey Zatkin regarding Lullaby and Pixie<br/>
Strike and received a brief reply.  I&#39;ll post the Arch Mage&#39;s replay first,<br/>
since I know it&#39;s what everyone wants to see.  My email to him follows.<br/>
<br/>
Sidebar:<br/>
Zatkin&#39;s computer date is at least one day ahead, as I received the email<br/>
from him on Friday (10.12.99) morning after having sent my mail on Thursday<br/>
(9.12.99) afternoon.  The time is likely correct at 9:32pm as I had checked<br/>
my email as late as 7:00pm on Thursday.</div>
