<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187591649">actually i realize it&#39;s an excellent belt for bards, but my haste item<br/>
happens to be my belt.  if it was a cloak i would probably wear a sludged<br/>
girdle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually, in fairness, it appears people either think the <br/>
&gt; sludged girdle is <br/>
&gt; great or is a worthless piece of trash and it is reflected in <br/>
&gt; the pricing <br/>
&gt; on some of the web pages out there. Some people have sold it <br/>
&gt; for 250 pp and <br/>
&gt; some for over 10k pp according to sites like eqprices.com, <br/>
&gt; eqmaps.com and <br/>
&gt; maximumeq.com<br/>
