consider it a problem if the time it takes to do this is<br/>
approximately the same as the experience gained from fighting<br/>
blues solo in the same time (which in my experience it has<br/>
been on average).  Like I said, to me power is a<br/>
multi-dimensional measure, and being extraordinarily good at<br/>
one thing (kiting) can easily be offset by being not-so-good<br/>
at one other thing (many in the case of a druid).  If you want<br/>
to measure it by one variable, then we&#39;re never going to<br/>
agree.<br/>
