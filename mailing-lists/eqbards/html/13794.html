<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893281509">For those of you who live in or near Milwaukee, WI...<br/>
<br/>
Saturday Feb 5 come to my house for a EQ gathering and Chili eating event<br/>
11am til ???<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to Xaria, Balandrus, Dazzler, Triston, Donna and hope Oren (Vezer)<br/>
sees this too (Innoruuk server people.)  Actually, anyone who can get there<br/>
from where ever you are is invited and welcome. Hint, hint: Japhia, Mac and<br/>
other Michigan, IL, IN, IA & MN players.  My place is easy access from the<br/>
interstate and there&#39;s a good variety of motels nearby if you wanna<br/>
overnight.<br/>
<br/>
My game room has 2 EQ pc&#39;s networked and sharing 128k ISDN so I think we<br/>
could add a couple more if you want to bring your stuff.  Also, I have 2<br/>
analog telco lines that could be used.  And if some one has AD&D or other<br/>
&#39;pen & paper&#39; rpg, I&#39;d love to see how that works too!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is invited and welcome - drop me an e mail to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jgs@...">jgs@...</a>  and<br/>
I will send you my phone number, directions & a map and that will also help<br/>
me know how many can actually make it.<br/>

p.s. this started as an idea for some local friends who play on Innoruuk<br/>
server but if any EQ players are in/near Milwaukee and want to drop by -<br/>
everyone is welcome!</div>
