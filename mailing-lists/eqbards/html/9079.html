&gt; But what explains this?<br/>
&gt; Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just watching, &quot;An orc<br/>
&gt; oracle begins to cast a spell.  You feel drowsy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In the middle of combat with a whole other party!  That&#39;s Bard Hate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My Cleric was meditating while another group was fighting in Unrest.  Out<br/>
of nowhere, the mob (forget what it was) cast a spell on me then continued<br/>
to fight the other party.  My group or I had did nothing to draw the mob.<br/>
Was this Bard Hate too?  NO.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, mobs have some randomness in who they attack.  Every<br/>
class will experience this.  I don&#39;t think Bards are more heavily weighted<br/>
than all other class.  Unfortunately Bards also draw mobs with their songs<br/>
that pulse every 6 seconds.  So they get both the random mobs and the<br/>
song-drawn mobs.  This is why it seems so much worse for Bards than any<br/>
other characters.<br/>
