<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832685058">when you create a gnome enchanter (dunno about other classes) you start<br/>
right next to the blacksmith/armory.  i did not know this, and i saw that<br/>
mechanized guide and hailed it and it walked me to the armory, which was not<br/>
at all far away. i thought that was the coolest thing ever hehe.  gnomes<br/>
have the best technology.  just had trouble finding the door.<br/>

&gt; &gt; When i got my steel plate, i made a gnome enchanter and <br/>
&gt; poured all points to<br/>
&gt; &gt; charisma.  since a gnome was buying from gnomes, more <br/>
&gt; charisma had no effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; on prices.   the breastplate was 768pp, and they rest were <br/>
&gt; slightly less<br/>
&gt; &gt; than your list as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, my prices are from the dwarves.  It could be the gnomes<br/>
&gt; have a different price table.  I couldn&#39;t find the gnome steel<br/>
&gt; plate merchant, and Ak&#39;kanon gives me motion sickness so I<br/>
&gt; stuck with the dwarves.  :-)<br/>
