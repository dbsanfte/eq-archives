<b>Subject:</b> Dalnir: any bard toys? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055983909">We&#39;re starting to explore Dalnir now in force.  I&#39;m told there&#39;s bard stuff<br/>
there but I think it&#39;s just a ploy to get me to log in my bard.<br/>
<br/>
Without huge spoilers, anything a bard can look forward to in here?  Cleric?<br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;ll continue going even if there&#39;s just xp and good times alone,<br/>
it&#39;s just nice to have a goal.<br/>
<br/>
(admit it, lower guk was a lot more exciting to explore when you saw what<br/>
people were hauling out of there :P)</div>
