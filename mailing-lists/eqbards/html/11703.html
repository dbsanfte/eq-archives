<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109197847">How much of what you said is relative to the number of other people camping<br/>
surrounding spawns?  I live in Hawaii and when I play its late on the<br/>
mainland.  Lately there have been around 800 people online at the time I log<br/>
in.  Usually around 600 when I log off.  I can usually find a group of<br/>
people around my level but there aren&#39;t a lot of other groups in the dungeon<br/>
zones.  As we are often one of the few groups in the zone, its sometimes<br/>
difficult to get deep in a dungeon where all the good stuff is usually<br/>
dropped.  So, assuming only a few groups in CT, how hard is it for one well<br/>
balanced group to fight their way to the rooms you listed and then hold on<br/>
to it?<br/>
<br/>
One other thing, my post focused on the safety issue, i.e. not dying while<br/>
you were trying to get thru a hell level.  I guess its a tradeoff between<br/>
getting good EXP and loot items versus not dying and getting thru hell as<br/>
quickly as possible.  I don&#39;t doubt that CT is better for EXP gain than<br/>
Highkeep or Rathe Mtns, but it is a hell of a lot riskier.  <br/>

&gt; Cazic-Thule.  I&#39;ve said it before: There&#39;s a learning curve to the place,<br/>
&gt; but if you can get into a competent and reasonably balanced group in the<br/>
&gt; throne room, Archon temple top or alligators at the green and blue pools<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; will be amazed at the experience and loot.  If you&#39;re unfamiliar with CT<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; need a hand figuring the place out *please* just ask.  I cannot stress how<br/>
&gt; well I did in this place from 28th-37th.  I made TONS of experience: A<br/>
&gt; full<br/>
&gt; level one Saturday at 31st and, and all of 30th in three evenings.  All<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; while I was staggering under the weight of fine steel weapons and 1-4pp<br/>
&gt; drops.<br/>
&gt; . </span></blockquote></div>
