I do indeed know your pain.  In fact I have actually begun to cultivate a<br/>
&quot;lets see if we can keep the Bard alive&quot; mentality amoungst our group.<br/>
Actually I have little or no attention from Mobs these days since our Ranger<br/>
and Monk can out damage me to the point even chains doesn&#39;t taunt the mob<br/>
onto me for very long.<br/>
<br/>
I had the same reaction from someone when they first say me play the bard at<br/>
the computer.  They were amazed that you had to keep hitting buttons.<br/>

Most of my current friends are actually pretty cool.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
they understand bards despite all their exposure.  Except for Rylos of<br/>
course, he knows my pain.  Can&#39;t forget our Ranger/Druid&#39;s first description<br/>
of seeing someone physically playing a bard for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Holy S#$@!  You guys have to do that all the time???  That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;<br/>
