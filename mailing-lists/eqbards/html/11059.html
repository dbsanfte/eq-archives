&gt; &gt;If (and I&#39;m not sure it would be worth it yet) bards are going to<br/>
&gt; &gt;protest with a sit in, it should be over the testing issue, not this<br/>
&gt; &gt;specific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>
&gt; &gt;at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>
&gt; &gt;standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;care.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Actually I&#39;d say this is the case regarding testing in general, not just<br/>
&gt; bard testing.  Its merely more amplified since no one plays bards regularly<br/>
&gt; on the team.  I have seen zero evidence they ever test anything, and much<br/>
&gt; evidence to the contrary.  They seem to have the typical old school (and I<br/>
&gt; mean really old, like 25+ years ago) mentality of, &quot;Hey it compiled ok.<br/>
&gt; Testing complete.&quot;<br/>

Unfortunately, I think once the game went live, the accountants took<br/>
over and I strongly suspect that the development group is on a very low<br/>
maintenance budget now. The speed at which changes are made, and the<br/>
problems they seem to have even understanding the code they are changing<br/>
really seems to point to them having very few people working on<br/>
maintenance, and, lower quality programmers than the people who actually<br/>
wrote the game to begin with. If they still had the original development<br/>
team, I&#39;d say at the rate and reliability they are currently fixing<br/>
problems, they never would have shipped the game even after 4 years in<br/>
development.<br/>
<br/>
One glaring example is the simple addition of the optional download<br/>
query they added to the client. It took the programmer two tries to get<br/>
the current dialog and even there the buttons aren&#39;t even correctly<br/>
aligned on the dialog box.<br/>
