&gt;I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts similar to this one on this list, and I have to <br/>
&gt;confess that I&#39;m baffled.  My<br/>
&gt;Lullaby works so well that people explicitly ask for it now in any fight <br/>
&gt;with 3 or more MOBs (provided we<br/>
&gt;have no Enchanter).  It gets resisted some, but it still takes the extra <br/>
&gt;(unattacked) MOBs out of the<br/>
&gt;fight for 50-75% of the time.<br/>

Lullaby worked very well for me.  Cleric, Pally, Bard, Druid and Wizard <br/>
ranges 32-36. We think we are great, we are owning the bedroom and pulling <br/>
all the way from the tower so we decide to pull the GIBS.  Within 10 seconds <br/>
of the pull the wizard goes linkdead. I lull away, lots of resists but when <br/>
it sticks it generally sticks.  When it looks like we will make it to the <br/>
end the druid has mana for evac, then when the tide turns and it looks like <br/>
evac time the druid doesn&#39;t have enough mana. 5 times I shouted evac, 5 <br/>
times the druid was OOM. 5 times the druid shouted Evac? and 5 times I said <br/>
NO!! After about 3 minutes me and the pally meleed the GIBS to 2 from 5 when <br/>
the room spawned. We got through that too and even survived the spider train <br/>
some soloer ran into us when we had 1 frog left.  Lullaby was no doubt about <br/>
it the difference between no deaths and a very quick evac. I loved that song <br/>
that night, but it has not been as reliable since and sitting in Sol B about <br/>
3 weeks ago I finally unmemmed it because there was a song that was actually <br/>
useful I could mem instead. :(<br/>
<br/>
I sure wish that at 45 lullaby was even half as effective as it was at 35.<br/>
