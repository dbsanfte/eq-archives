<div id="ygrps-yiv-79975122">Going for a Kisch at 19??  All I can say is...if you pull that off, <br/>
you are definetly Super Bard in my book!!  It took me at 30ish <br/>
something with a 50 Enchanter, 48 Paladin, and a 40ish something Mage <br/>
to take obtain my Kisch.  It&#39;s all the other gnolls in the room as <br/>
well that make it a tough battle.<br/>

&gt; There are some Right of Passage places I was forgetting too, like <br/>
wisps in<br/>
&gt; Erud&#39;s crossing at 12.<br/>
