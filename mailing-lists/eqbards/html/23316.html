<div id="ygrps-yiv-902666904">Heh..yeah.  I was able to work on the other machine while playing my cleric.<br/>
At 19, I have:<br/>
1 - Smite<br/>
2 - Expulse Undead<br/>
3 - Root<br/>
4 - Healing<br/>
5 - Extinguish Fatigue<br/>
6 - Spirit Armor<br/>
7 - Daring<br/>
8 - Divine Aura (Always and Forever)<br/>
<br/>
I have healing hotkeyed at #4 and DA hotkeyed at #6.  The rest are easy<br/>
enough to cast using alt-#.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have...what are some techniques you guys use for organizing<br/>
your spell book?  Heh...<br/>
<br/>
For my bard, they&#39;re just in order by level.  This is easiest, since I can<br/>
really choose from almost any song, regardless of level.  Makes it easy to<br/>
guess which page a song is on.  I even left the spot blank for Melliflous<br/>
Motion (spelling..heh..).  I&#39;ve never bothered to buy that one.  Seems<br/>
awfully dangerous...heh.<br/>
<br/>
For the cleric, and the rest of my casters, the first 8 scribe slots are the<br/>
8 spells I have memmed.  Then I try to decide which 2 are the next most<br/>
used, and put those in the 2 remaining scribe spots on pages 1 and 2.  Pages<br/>
3 and 4 are spells I don&#39;t use often, but the possibility of use exists.<br/>
Page 5 are my cures, poison, disease, etc.  Page 6 are the endures, poison,<br/>
disease, etc.  The low level spells, ones I don&#39;t expect to ever use again,<br/>
are currently around page 20 - 21.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was playing my cleric this weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have my #4 button set up to throw my main heal, and #0 set up with the<br/>
&gt; Spells hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I have the following imprint on my left index finger:<br/>
&gt; $<br/>
&gt; 4<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and the following imprint on my right index finger:<br/>
&gt; )<br/>
&gt; 0<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hehe...  :)  Stand, heal, sit.  Stand, heal, sit.  Had an awesome group.<br/>
&gt; Had one main tank that managed to take *all* the beating, so didn&#39;t have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; jump around targeting people.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kind of my point exactly.  There not much to a cleric&#39;s life.  Buff, Med,<br/>
Heal, Med...<br/>
<br/>
I became involved (IE got a part in) a play and my rehersal schedule<br/>
conflicted with my regular EQ group.  Fortunatly (at the time) I lived with<br/>
your group&#39;s warrior, and he was able to run both pc&#39;s and play both<br/>
characters without much of a hiccup (granted they picked easy places to camp<br/>
like Dalnir&#39;s while he was doing this).<br/>
<br/>
Heres what my cleric hot key bank looks like:<br/>
1. Valor (replace with random spell like counteract poison if situation<br/>
calls for it)<br/>
2. Sup Heal<br/>
3. Greater Heal<br/>
4. Root<br/>
5. Stun<br/>
6. Holy Might (another stun spell) (If they aren&#39;t any caster mobs I care<br/>
about, Wrath (dd spell) goes here)<br/>
7. Buff spell (rotates between ac/symbol/resists)<br/>
8. Divine Aura (30 sec invul spell, recast time is 15 min, so its always<br/>
memmed)<br/>
<br/>
It never changes.  I have had all these spells (or their lower level<br/>
version) since level 4 I think.  It will never change (except name changes<br/>
when I get an upgrade).<br/>
<br/>
Most fights, I never see the mobs (well now I will since I finally lost my<br/>
spell book while medding).<br/>
<br/>
I;m not complaining, in many ways I like my cleric. Its easy, its relaxing,<br/>
I watch Smackdown while I am playing (Flame away with &quot;Then you aren&#39;t<br/>
playing your cleric right&quot;  I&#39;ve heard it before...My group has a run of 5<br/>
straight weeks of 0 deaths.  This has been done 100% inside dungeons, 75%<br/>
with no enchancter, 100% with my insane former roomate pulling, who&#39;s quoted<br/>
as saying &quot;I was bored so I decided to pull 3 casters&quot;, and we have gotten<br/>
at least a (non hell) level every 5-6 hour session, with non twinked<br/>
characters.  We are effective)  I&#39;m just saying, I gave up alot when I chose<br/>
cleric.<br/>
