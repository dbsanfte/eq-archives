and wait for all but one of the mobs to walk back to their<br/>
&quot;rest&quot; position.  Usually the one they attacked would be the<br/>
last to leave, and when it was alone they could pull it to the<br/>
group.  If it wasn&#39;t the last one to leave, they could repeat<br/>
the process as soon as it started leaving, and thus whittle<br/>
the pull down until they had only the mob they wanted.  Took<br/>
more time, but was safer since they could get rid of mobs<br/>
*after* they&#39;d gone aggro.<br/>
