<div id="ygrps-yiv-262098822">Crookstinger doesn&#39;t use a specific poison.  Instead it has a Weak Poison<br/>
spell that will occasionally proc.  You don&#39;t have to buy/apply poison to<br/>
get the Weak Poison effect.  Everytime you hit there is a check to see if<br/>
the proc goes off.      <br/>
