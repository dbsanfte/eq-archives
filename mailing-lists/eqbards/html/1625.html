<b>Subject:</b> Petition about faction hit <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800673662">I think that we should petition about our hit list.  We should not be hated<br/>
by every agressive npc that we meet.  For example, i would be standing<br/>
healing myself then suddenly these Orc&#39;s warriors from all the way from the<br/>
distance would rush up and beat me to a pulp.  or when they would not attack<br/>
the nearest pc but would travel the extra distance just to attack u.<br/>
Another rant is we would get a faction hit for doing nothing at all except<br/>
being near the MOB&#39;s death.  Don&#39;t you all think this is very annoying.<br/>
