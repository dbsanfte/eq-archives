<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274310002">I may be beating a dead horse,but.......I have been useing a mino axe for<br/>
the last 3 levels,singing a mix of Warsong and Anthem and hitting about<br/>
every 4.5 to 5 seconds. Then last nite i was given a Tenticle whip by a<br/>
guildmate and WOW !!!!! I was hitting about every 2 sec. in fighting a Giant<br/>
spider I was getting 3 to 4 swings to every 1 of the spiders.  I must say<br/>
that if ye have the means(17pp) pick one up.  It is a great starting weapon<br/>
for early teen bards!<br/>
Thanks for a great list keep up the good work all :-)<br/>
