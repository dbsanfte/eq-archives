<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156175139">i have all of the jewelery you mentioned, as well as the gloves and belt.<br/>
however, being a battle bard i chose different rings.  i have 2 platinum<br/>
fire emerald rings which give 5STR/5DEX.  also, most wood elf bards don&#39;t<br/>
have the best STR base, even with putting all points into it like i did.<br/>
just another take on the jewelery thing =)<br/>

&gt; I have looked over all the jewellery that an enchanter can make.<br/>
&gt; I also realize there are earrings, rings, etc available to higher<br/>
&gt; level players from dungeons.  This is my take on the best player<br/>
&gt; made jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I currently wear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; face:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>
&gt; neck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>
&gt; ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
&gt; ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
&gt; finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
&gt; finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; most bards, have a good charisma and strength base to start<br/>
&gt; dex is extremely important, and agility is to some extent.<br/>
&gt; intellegence and wisdom are completely useless in day to day<br/>
&gt; bardic activities, although I have wis/int gear for trade skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this combo gives, dex30, agi7, int4, str8, cha19<br/>
&gt; and this is the best you can get player made, best in the game imo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; couple this with elfhide gloves, ac4, dex5, agi5  (brd rog only)<br/>
&gt; and troll hide belt, ac5, str5, sta5 (brd rog only)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you have a extremely well balanced bard, statistically speaking.<br/>
