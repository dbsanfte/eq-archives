<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833144613">I also meant to ask this in my last email.........<br/>
<br/>
Can someone give me a good tactic on how I can take Choon/Froon, I hear<br/>
stuff about Fear/Chains etc but Fear has a really poor range and you have<br/>
to be within hitting range for it to work, if I get too close to Choon he<br/>
hits me and interupts my song, am I doing something wrong or is it just a<br/>
hard trick to pull off?<br/>
<br/>
I tried to melee Choon but I barely hit him, maybe I should wait till level<br/>
28 so that I may have a chance with my Staff Proc (Chaotic Feedback).<br/>
<br/>
Any help/info would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone on Veeshan<br/>
fancies helping a fellow bard then that would also be appreciated too.<br/>

I can tell you that I went to go kill them one night with a level 31<br/>
ranger and my 29th druid and the ranger ended up dying (although I was<br/>
not full mana and wasn&#39;t ready for the pull)...they are mean...conned<br/>
yellow to me at 29.  If you can keep him from pounding on you too much<br/>
you may be able to have the mage nuke him  but...at your level I would<br/>
be really careful adn have an escape route planned....<br/>

&gt; &gt;I payed 60pp for a Lambent stone last night (was asking 100pp), I<br/>
&gt; also got<br/>
&gt; &gt;myself 2 sapphires and now all I need is the rune from Choon in WK.<br/>
&gt; Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;know hard this is to get, bearing in mind I am only level 27. My<br/>
&gt; friend<br/>
&gt; &gt;will help me kill him (level 28 Mage) so I think we could take him,<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone tell me how hard Choon is to locate??<br/>
