<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823287531">I really couldn&#39;t agree more; I&#39;ve been in some groups where /assist-ing<br/>
simply wasn&#39;t done, and I died(again!). I&#39;ve managed to find a good group<br/>
now that actually listens (!) to me. We&#39;ve managed to take 4 bandits at once<br/>
with this song; I think that was what convinced them! Still, during a fight,<br/>
I say Assist the puller several times, just as a reminder.<br/>

&gt;Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>
&gt;everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It was<br/>
&gt;late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>
&gt;situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>
&gt;convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out of there if<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>
&gt;cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>
