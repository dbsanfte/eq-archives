Be careful your magic users don&#39;t have pets/animations. <br/>
Seems the little critters get VERY upset when their master disappears, and<br/>
show you their displeasure by inflicting excessive damage on themselves<br/>
and dyeing, and the owners then get a tad upset too :&gt;<br/>

It definitely does.  I use a minotaur horn all the time.  I never really<br/>
had to spefically practice my wind skill.  When I got invisibility, I<br/>
ended<br/>
up using it so much, that it goes up to max each level on its own.<br/>
<br/>
A tip, if you&#39;re in a train prone zone, like Mistmoore for example, and<br/>
you&#39;re in a group that has mana dumpers.  When the party is done being<br/>
healed up with Hymn, kick in group invisibility.  It&#39;s saved my party and<br/>
my own life on numerous occasions.  Of course, this only applies between<br/>
levels 19 and 31.  (Not that I would know about the latter level...)<br/>
