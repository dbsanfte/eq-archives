&gt; Tszaaz, you&#39;re killing me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Level 6.5<br/>
&gt; &gt; Play time ~2 days<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m at 11 and two bubbles with a ridiculously long play time for my level<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Platinum: 40<br/>
&gt; ~12 pp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gets even sadder when I look at what I&#39;m wearing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; no earrings<br/>
&gt; golden locket (gift from guild)<br/>
&gt; iron visor (guild)<br/>
&gt; patchwork scullcap<br/>
&gt; clawed knuckle ring (guild), other finger&#39;s empty<br/>
&gt; patchwork wristband<br/>
&gt; S ringmail bracelet (looted from a watchman)<br/>
&gt; S ringmail sleeves (watchman)<br/>
&gt; S ringmail gloves (watchman)<br/>
&gt; Dwarven ringmail tunic (guild)<br/>
&gt; wolf-hide belt<br/>
&gt; S raw-hide leggins<br/>
&gt; S ringmail boots (watchman)<br/>
&gt; FS dagger (watchmen)<br/>
&gt; Qeynos kite shield (guild)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Things to buy before I am satisfied (for now):<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bracer of Errolissi(sp, sorry)<br/>
&gt; &gt; small Bronze boots<br/>
&gt; &gt; Small bronze BP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go on, rub salt in the wound!  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;d be happy with some strength<br/>
jewelry,<br/>
&gt; but the +3 stuff I&#39;ve seen for sale had an asking price of ~30pp, which I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t got.  I have better gloves in the bank (black enameled something<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; other ...I forget, another guild gift) and I think I&#39;ve got a better hat<br/>
&gt; too, but I can&#39;t wear them as I&#39;ve got only ~10 pounds to spare for loot<br/>
&gt; dressed as is.  So my new plan is to head to the swap and see if I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; replace some of my items with netted/woven/mesh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To sum up: this is outrageous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I AGREE!!!  And you shoulda seen what I was wearing BEFORE cleaning up<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; guard campers and getting twinked by my guildmistress!  I&#39;d get invited<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; groups and hear &quot;First thing we need to do is get Ev&#39;s corpse&quot;.  Confused<br/>
&gt; newbies would see me playing a lute and comment &quot;I thought bards could<br/>
wear<br/>
&gt; anything&quot;.  I&#39;d wander through the streets of Freeport and hear &quot;May I<br/>
give<br/>
&gt; you some copper please?&quot; coming out my speakers!  On the other hand<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; free & unsolicited SoW&#39;s everytime I walked in or out of a city was kinda<br/>
&gt; nice. Heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So uh, where is it I should take milk & muffins to and how much should I<br/>
buy<br/>
&gt; FS weapons for again?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
&gt; Evulia, doing everything wrong, Tunare<br/>
