<div id="ygrps-yiv-487626078">the idea of targetting a player and being able to t-port to that player&#39;s<br/>
corpse<br/>
LOL!  i can see it now! :)<br/>
<br/>
scenario 1:<br/>
<br/>
Group of 24 fights their way thru the first island in Air.  use keys to get to<br/>
2nd island in air.  then, someone duels another person there, your 20 50th<br/>
level bards all target that person (at their bind point) and teleport to his<br/>
corpse&#39;s location.  Cleric ressurrects the duels loser.  heh...a teleporting<br/>
army of bards.<br/>
<br/>
scenario 2:<br/>
Group fights all the way thru kedge keep to Phingel&#39;s area....then calls in<br/>
their &quot;teleporting army of bards&quot; (tm) [via the process described above]to<br/>
assist with the final fight...<br/>
<br/>
err...i think you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
that would be really funny.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda reminds me of 1st edition AD&D barbarians [unearthed arcana] that could<br/>
&quot;Summon a Barbarian horde&quot; to fight for them.  does that date me :) ?<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
