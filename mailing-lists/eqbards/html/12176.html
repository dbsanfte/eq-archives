failure (mob resists and goes aggro) I&#39;ve had with Lament<br/>
since I started re-using it at about L35.  Maybe they are more<br/>
resistant to lulls than other mobs?<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, for a L35-46 party, they are not much trouble.  <br/>
I would try only one at a time at around L30, unless you have<br/>
a competent enchanter with you (one that will conserve mana to<br/>
keep the others mesmerized while your party recuperates).  <br/>
I&#39;ve had pretty good luck playing Elemental Rhythms with a<br/>
drum against them.  Their DDs are not too bad since they&#39;re<br/>
usually directed against the tanks or bard (who have a decent<br/>
number of hp).  But their AE can panic a group, especially if <br/>
several of them cast them in rapid succession.<br/>

&gt; very very fast.  Especially if you get more than one.  If you get the whole<br/>
&gt; room - it&#39;s a disaster - even for a mid to upper 30&#39;s group.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrmph.  We&#39;ve done all 5 at once with a L35-40 group, no<br/>
enchanter.  I played Lullaby and ER (with a lute or drum<br/>
depending on how many GIBs were left - I have a lot of paladin<br/>
friends with ghoulbane so once we get it down to about 3, I<br/>
switch to ER and CoB with a drum to get those ghoulbanes<br/>
proc&#39;ing).  We tried all 5 at once a couple times in our low<br/>
30s, and needed the help of another group both times.  But it<br/>
wasn&#39;t instant death (well, the one time it was instant death<br/>
was when we were recuperating from another fight and I didn&#39;t<br/>
have time to get our resists up).<br/>
<br/>
But for a low-30s group, I&#39;d recommend following the right<br/>
wall from the bedroom to fight the spiders and bats (vampire<br/>
bats, not sonic - sonic bats are in Sol B and are very bad<br/>
news).  The loot sucks, but the experience is good and the<br/>
mobs are more easily controlled (esp. with charm - they seem<br/>
to resist much less than frogs).  Just past the spider room,<br/>
the hall continues through a few turns, and opens up into a<br/>
room with a door on the right wall, just before the bridge<br/>
leading to the Assassin spot and other wonders.  (Incidently,<br/>
the GIBs route also connects to here, and the door leads to<br/>
the live side.)  The gargoyles spawn here, so you can usually<br/>
pull them while you&#39;re keeping the spider room clear.  The<br/>
best part of the spider room is that trains rarely go through<br/>
there.<br/>

bubble.  Welcome to Hell.  :-)<br/>
