<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099007237">The funny thing about this fight is the groups we had.  We&#39;ve beaten<br/>
Maestro with the same group many times, so we thought no problem (24 of us<br/>
at the time, we normally fight with 18 and get a couple more during the<br/>
night).  Our monk pulls great in this zone and can get Maestro single even<br/>
when his room is full.<br/>
<br/>
We thought it was a fluke, so we tried again and got spanked again.  I&#39;m<br/>
not even sure what went wrong the first two times, although we talked about<br/>
it and it seems that the clerics didn&#39;t use stun all that often.  Stunning<br/>
this sucker helps a lot, but even then we couldn&#39;t explain how badly we got<br/>
owned.  So we made sure one of the clerics inthe 2cleric groups was chain<br/>
stunning.  Still didn&#39;t help, although this time it was close.  Then we<br/>
thought it was because he was duel wielding that gave him such an edge,<br/>
since we had recently gotten owned by Cazic when he was duel wielding a a<br/>
bloodmoon (whatever the warrior only weapon is) and a Soul Leach.<br/>
<br/>
We think it had much more to do with the group balance than anything else,<br/>
and maybe group size.  We had 24, fairly unbalanced groups (no wizards, no<br/>
necros, no druids, 1 mage, 2 shaman, 9 warriors, 6 clerics, 2 enchanters,<br/>
one pally, one rogue, one monk, and one &lt;very happy at the end of the<br/>
night&gt; bard).  We brought up 2 wizzies, a necro, an SK, and 2 clerics, and<br/>
he died pretty quick the 4th time.<br/>

Hmm,<br/>
<br/>
My guild went to PoH Friday night.  By 4am, we had cleared everything (110+<br/>
kills) and had the maestro all alone.  There were about 25 of us and we<br/>
took<br/>
him without any problems.  One clearing pull that agro&#39;d an outside patrol<br/>
group smooshed us lots harder than he did.  Our pullers brought his guards<br/>
2<br/>
at a time and we did them before hitting him.  He was definitely a red to<br/>
50<br/>
mob but did not seem as tough as Naggy or Vox.  It has been nearly 10<br/>
levels<br/>
since I have see the dragons so I hope you are right.</div>
