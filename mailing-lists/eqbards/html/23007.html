<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129621511">I have always been content with the &quot;power&quot; of the bard class in relation to<br/>
the other classes.  However, since Verant seems to be amenable to improving<br/>
the power of the hybrids, why shouldn&#39;t we try to make our class better than<br/>
it already is?  In the last patch, all of the hybrid disciplines got<br/>
improved so no issues there.  However, all the other hybrids just recieved<br/>
an upgrade (new 50th level spells) to their abilities to close the gap in<br/>
&quot;power&quot; between hybrids and non-hybrids.  Bards did not get a similar<br/>
upgrade.  Perhaps Verant didn&#39;t think we needed it?  Who knows?    <br/>
<br/>
My proposal on haste stacking was based on the idea that it would be a way<br/>
for Verant to increase the power of the bard class without adding new songs,<br/>
raising skill caps, etc.  IMO trying to get a new 50th level song or getting<br/>
skill caps raised would have little to no chance of ever getting approved.<br/>
Getting our haste songs to stack however might have a better chance.  We<br/>
won&#39;t know unless we request it.  <br/>
<br/>
If one of the options I listed were actually implemented, it would make<br/>
bards even more group-friendly than they already are.  Even if you think we<br/>
are prefectly balanced as is, would any of you NOT want that to happen?<br/>

I personally think our power is balanced with the other classes as the<br/>
game currently exists and any haste stacking would overpower the bard<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
One of the flaws that I see in a lot of arguments for more powers is &#39;&#39;in<br/>
literature<br/>
bards have...blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;in history, bards were....blah blah<br/>
blah&#39;&#39;, or my<br/>
favorite, &#39;&#39;in my vision bards should be able to do....blah blah blah, the<br/>
designer<br/>
Verant&#39;s vision is obviously wrong&#39;&#39;.  While everquest can be said to be<br/>
loosely based <br/>
on various fantasy sources, it is a separate entity and any direct<br/>
comparisons to<br/>
external sources really aren&#39;t necessarily a compelling argument for or<br/>
against anything.<br/>
