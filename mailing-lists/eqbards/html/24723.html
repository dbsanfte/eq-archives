<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852861950"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; However if that was a concern you&#39;d merely let charm drop <br/>
&gt; before the other mob dies...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like a good idea, until you realize what you are really <br/>
saying. Let&#39;s say, Gaelthorne, the bored Bard is soloing. Now, I am <br/>
lucky and I find two mobs with 2000 hp each (hey, it&#39;s just an <br/>
example, go with it.)<br/>
<br/>
I charm MOB A to fight MOB B, when MOB B is down to 500 life, I go in <br/>
for the kill. If I use MOB A to finish the fight, I get half exp (As <br/>
far as I know -- I believe this to be true.). If I let charm drop and <br/>
kill MOB B, MOB B will disappear and I will get NO exp. Why is this? <br/>
Simple, 1500 HP of damage is assigned to a MOB (remember the guards <br/>
in the newbie areas?) If you are outdamaged by a MOB, say bye, bye to <br/>
the exp.<br/>
