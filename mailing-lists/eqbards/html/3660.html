<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Something neat about shamans (and I assume clerics, druids<br/>
&gt;and enchanters) is the ability to commit random acts of kindness.<br/>
&gt;Walk up to a fight, looks close?  Cast a heal or two, and a<br/>
&gt;couple of buffs, walk on.  I&#39;ve yet to find a way to do this well<br/>
&gt;with my bard.  The only way to do it is to directly affect the<br/>
&gt;mob, and that seems rude to me without an invitation, even if<br/>
&gt;there is no chance of kill stealing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone got any tips for this sort of activity as a bard?<br/>

or Melodic Binding.  The Lullaby is great when you see a caster trying to <br/>
solo since it gives them a chance to get spells off. Melodic Binding does a <br/>
nice attack slowdown and lowers the bad guys AC.<br/>
