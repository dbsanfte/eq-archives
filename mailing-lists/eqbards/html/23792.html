<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896355498">Ok, I know we&#39;ve been over and over this, and I even saved some of the<br/>
emails, but....as our IT department is having a crackdown and we are in the<br/>
midst of a merger, they enforced our 40mb limit on mailbox sizes and yes, I<br/>
admit it, I trashed my store of eqbards mails ... bad me!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, what I would like to know is what you high level bards are wearing<br/>
and weilding .. the weapons/instruments you actually use up into the<br/>
mid-high 50s.  I&#39;d also like to know if you feel like it, where I can get<br/>
these items .. yes I can look them up but feeling lazy today!<br/>
 <br/>
As soon as Halana hits 59 (I&#39;ve given up on 60), I&#39;m going to start focusing<br/>
on BRD.<br/>
 <br/>
Currently, Tani has (forgive me for spelling mistakes):<br/>
 <br/>
-sionoche&#39;s partisan <br/>
-journeymans stick<br/>
-mistmoore drums (working on getting selos)<br/>
-lute from mistmoore<br/>
-dragonborne sash<br/>
-lizzie cloak<br/>
-those earrings from mistmoore<br/>
-fire opal rings<br/>
-fungi tunic<br/>
-kylong legs, bracers, hat<br/>
-ss boots, gloves<br/>
-tattered mantle<br/>
-forget the necklace<br/>
 <br/>
Let me know which items you all think I can improve on .. especially<br/>
weaponwise...if you want send me a private email so Im not spamming everyone<br/>
- this is already long!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, smooches, love you all :)<br/>
