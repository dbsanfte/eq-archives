<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525556930">That&#39;s not quite correct. My earlier post explains that there are many<br/>
variables to take into account when tracking damage and that there<br/>
often *is* a damage reduction for a warrior that adds a second melee<br/>
to their group. It&#39;s just not necessarily due to mysterious code. :)<br/>
<br/>
Kit&#39;s idea also doesn&#39;t necessarily invalidate the suggestion that<br/>
there may be some sort of code to reduce the damage a warrior does<br/>
when grouped with another melee. It neatly explains the reduction<br/>
assuming that adding a second melee will provide more melee damage<br/>
thus reducing the amount of hits the warrior gets on each creature<br/>
while the creature is in a weakened state (and overall) but there<br/>
aren&#39;t enough facts to find out what percent of time the creature is<br/>
in a weakened state and what percent of extra damage the second melee<br/>
provides to find out if the 15% difference in warrior damage is fully<br/>
accounted for.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not very good at math so I won&#39;t bother making guesses at what<br/>
kind of information needs to be collected to get sufficient facts to<br/>
prove or disprove Kit&#39;s theory. However, I think the concepts are very<br/>
interesting since there definitely is something going on with warrior<br/>
damage when grouped with a second melee. And it has some implications<br/>
to bards when choosing a song mix to buff melee types. By knowing what<br/>
causes the reduction, perhaps bards can minimize the reduction or take<br/>
advantage of the cause of the increased damage when a warrior is the<br/>
only melee?<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Nice analysis Aanluil, thoug you&#39;re basically saying the increased<br/>
damage<br/>
&gt; taken/reduced damage done is an illusion or due to the situation<br/>
changing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The former says there is no difference and the latter invalidates<br/>
the study<br/>
&gt; since the situation has altered. </span></blockquote></div>
