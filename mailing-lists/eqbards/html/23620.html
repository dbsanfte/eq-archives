<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959792347">some major snipping below...<br/>
<br/>
First, some background - I work at a computer shop, doing alot of service<br/>
work on home and office machines, and I&#39;m certified Microsoft &lt;insert<br/>
product here(well, not ALL of them...)&gt;, as well as alot of hardware vendor<br/>
certs.  I work on an average of 10-40 machines/week, most running win9x,<br/>
winnt, or win2k.<br/>
<br/>
With ME, I&#39;ve noted a few things...<br/>
If you have a PC that came loaded with 98 SE, you are probably ok to<br/>
upgrade.<br/>
If you have a PC that came loaded with 95, 95a, 95b, or 98 First Edition,<br/>
DON&#39;T even mess with trying to upgrade.  Yeah, I know microsoft says it will<br/>
work, but you&#39;ll cause yourself more headaches than you know.  If you must<br/>
upgrade, upgrade to 98 SE, and you&#39;ll be happier.<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T load PcAnywhere 9.x or up on ME.  Hoses up the network stack, and<br/>
causes lot&#39;s of little niggling errors that are impossible to get rid of. It<br/>
works on some machines, but not others.  If you have to use PCA, use 98SE or<br/>
NT4.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful of device drivers, try not to use anything written for 95 or 98<br/>
FE.  if it&#39;s for 98SE, you&#39;re probably ok.  I&#39;ve seen more device drivers<br/>
written for the first run of 95 hose up ME machines than I&#39;d care to count.<br/>
<br/>
Reload, either every 6 months or 1 year, and reinstall applications.  I<br/>
know, it takes alot of time, but is it better to have a clean running system<br/>
that you spend 8 or 10 hours on every 6 months doing maintenance, or one<br/>
that you will be fighting crashes on every other day?<br/>
<br/>
With Win2k, same thing applies as above, it&#39;s just a bit easier to backup<br/>
your stuff for reloads (docuements and settings directory is a godsend for<br/>
this :)  I haven&#39;t noted any major troubles with Win2k boxes unless driver<br/>
support is non-existant.  Worst case i&#39;ve seen: some guy managed to get his<br/>
to load iomega drivers from the original cd that was sent for win95.  The<br/>
only way to fix that box was to reload.<br/>
<br/>
Tips for reloading:  (assumption is that you have a hard drive with a bit of<br/>
extra space, in the range of 500mb +)<br/>
<br/>
copy all the files from your cd in the win9x directory (not the other root<br/>
directories, or the subdirectories, you don&#39;t need those) to your hard<br/>
drive, in something like c:&#92;win98 or c:&#92;win9x or something.  Make sure you<br/>
have a driver directory, with current drivers for all of your hardware,<br/>
including modems, motherboard, video, sound, etc.  Also, make sure you have<br/>
a copy of the Internet Explorer Installation program for your favorite<br/>
flavor (4.x, 5.0, 5.5) if you use that, or the installation file for<br/>
netscape (reloading will blow IE out for sure, netscape just won&#39;t run right<br/>
until you reinstall it).  After you are sure everything is in place, follow<br/>
the next steps:<br/>
<br/>
Scandisk<br/>
Defrag<br/>
reboot to safe mode MS-Dos Prompt (hit F8 when it says &#39;Starting Windows&#39;,<br/>
you have about 2 seconds...I usually just start hitting F8 repeatedly after<br/>
the memory count)<br/>
Rename your windows directory:  i.e. c:&#92;&gt;move windows win.old  (just in case<br/>
something goes wrong :)<br/>
Go into the source directory (remember the win9x files?) c:&#92;&gt;cd win98<br/>
Run setup with /is (skip the disk check, you&#39;ve already done scandisk and<br/>
defrag :)  c:&#92;win98&#92;&gt;setup /is<br/>
Fill in the prompts, when it asks you what directory to install to, it will<br/>
prompt you for Win.old, change this to Windows.<br/>
install device drivers, apps, etc.  All your documents will be where they<br/>
were, except for email if you use Outlook Express or Outlook.  You&#39;ll need<br/>
to import those and any favorites, cookies, shortcuts, etc. from the win.old<br/>
directory (email me if you need help with this).  Once you are happy with<br/>
the new load and have gotten everything you need out of win.old, delete the<br/>
win.old directory, and you have a clean, reloaded machine.<br/>
<br/>
If you have questions or doubts, please email me (i do this at least once a<br/>
day on various machines :)<br/>
<br/>
wow, what a ramble...sorry about the length :)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Have to agree with the multiple upgrade, no reformat (no reinstalls) - and<br/>
&gt; believe it or not .. I&#39;ve even seen no defrag on QA machines (ones that<br/>
&gt; install and then overinstall the software to be tested often daily).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It amazing the issues a total reinstall on your machine can fix.  Even on<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &quot;just&quot; a gaming machine I&#39;d go with completely reinstalling the OS from<br/>
&gt; scratch at least once a year.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I for one can tell you that I have been running WinME for several<br/>
&gt; &gt; months now without problems.  I run it side by side with a Win2k Adv<br/>
&gt; Server<br/>
&gt; &gt; and have had very few problems with each.  The server has been running<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; months now without a reboot, the WinME Machine has been outstanding for<br/>
&gt; &gt; gaming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think what it really comes down to is this.  What are you using the<br/>
&gt; &gt; machine for?  If its work, then security and lower TCO is most likely an<br/>
&gt; &gt; issue and I would recommend the W2K series of OS&#39;s.  If the machine is<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal or home use (games / ease of use / intuitiveness) , use WinME.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are two big areas that we have seen people need support on:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.  Someone has taken their machine that has gone through EVERY OS<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade and has never reformatted it or just cleaned up the drive.<br/>
(Some<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues there)<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  Someone is taking a WinME machine and trying to make into a high<br/>
&gt; &gt; end work production machine...it was never designed to be that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my .02 :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have a great day Everyone!<br/>
