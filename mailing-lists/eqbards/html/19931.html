<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364351"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Um. That is part of playing on Test.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. You&#39;ll notice from my previous post that I understood the necessity to<br/>
wipe the player base, but not the manner in which they conducted it; ie,<br/>
they didn&#39;t forewarn anybody.<br/>
<br/>
All things considered, it wasn&#39;t the smartest thing to do.  Now they&#39;ve got<br/>
a few hundred &#39;newbies&#39; running around.  How are they going to continue<br/>
testing high level spells, songs, skills and zones?  Wait for a few months<br/>
until people are of a sufficient level?  More likely, the GMs will do what<br/>
they did before and buff a select few to the level they require and they&#39;ll<br/>
be back to square one again.<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee that the majority of people who get buffed to 50 or 60,<br/>
dumped in a zone and told to test it will not do so objectively.  The only<br/>
people who should test such places and situations are those who have<br/>
actually attained that level, either in test or live, in a progressive<br/>
manner such that they understand how a character should be played at that<br/>
level.  You can&#39;t dump a buffed newbie (or even a buffed 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s<br/>
character) into a situation that requires level 50 knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
IRL, I&#39;m a Quality Assurance Analyst.  I need to know every nook and crannie<br/>
of our product in order to effectively test updates, enhancements, nerfs<br/>
(they do happen ;) and changes.  The same goes with EverQuest.  Sure, any<br/>
Tom, Dick or Harry can find geometry errors, typos, broken quests etc, but<br/>
you need someone that knows their class abilities inside out to effectively<br/>
test the complexitites of their spells/songs and skills.<br/>
<br/>
People treated Test like a live server and played there because the<br/>
population is substantially less than on the others.  But even so, it would<br/>
have been a simple courtesy to warn players a few days to a week before of<br/>
their intentions.<br/>
<br/>
And when was the last time they did a complete player wipe?  Certainly not<br/>
recently, because Lyrnia&#39;s bard was level 50.</div>
