I&#39;ve seen maybe two pieces of medium bronze EVER. =) Ok, so where does it <br/>
drop? Someone asked me last night, upon telling him i made a SHD, &quot;Let&#39;s go <br/>
hunt in Najena.&quot; Does medium sized bronze drop there off &lt;30 mobs? In <br/>
addition, I&#39;d like to verify that SHD&#39;s do have class specific armor... is <br/>
it the Darkforge? If so, I&#39;ll just look it up on a eqshadowknights page or <br/>
something. No need to go into specifics, seeing this is a bard list.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing... What&#39;s a good slasher i can camp for this poor little guy? <br/>
Dark Reaver is SHD only right? Is Pain Bringer WAR only? It sticks in my <br/>
mind as such... Well ok.. Thank you all in advance for your advice and help. <br/>
Look forward to seeing you on! =)<br/>
