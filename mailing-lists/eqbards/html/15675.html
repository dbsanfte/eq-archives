&gt;OK, this OT even on Easter Eggs, but since Verant has been totally unable to<br/>
&gt;help me, maybe somebody else on this list can.  I cannot ever hear any of<br/>
&gt;the non-combat sounds that mobs make.  No skittering of feet, no giants<br/>
&gt;stomping, no wolves howling, no madmen begging.  I have an A3d card with the<br/>
&gt;latest drivers and I know for a fact one of my friends has an A3d card and<br/>
&gt;he hears all the sounds just fine.  I have tried everything I could think<br/>
&gt;of, and Verant&#39;s tech support only managed to get all my sounds turned off (<br/>
&gt;I fixed that ).  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - they&#39;re still doing weird things with sound.  I know that recently <br/>
all of my combat sounds started sounding &quot;really far away&quot; - Like they&#39;re <br/>
happening to someone standing near me, but not to me.<br/>
<br/>
But if I sit down, the sounds are suddenly right??  I guess they have the <br/>
&quot;center of source&quot; as the center of the model - not the model&#39;s head?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;m wondering if I turn my sound effects down to the point where <br/>
3d sound turns off if that will help.<br/>
<br/>
In your case, I&#39;d make sure that my sound settings are maxed.  Other than <br/>
that, it&#39;s the program.<br/>
