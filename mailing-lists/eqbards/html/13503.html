<div id="ygrps-yiv-627293644">Servers To Be Restarted<br/>
Abashi made the following announcement on the official forums this evening:<br/>
Hello all,<br/>
We&#39;ll be taking the servers down 1 by 1 in the near future to roll in the<br/>
fix regarding bards and procing weapons. The bug was introduced as an<br/>
unintentional part of the patch and was missed during the testing process.<br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience.<br/>
