&gt;As an aside I wouldn&#39;t mind if they made all dropped items no drop. <br/>
&gt;Farming would be no more.  Everyone would earn their own items.  THis<br/>
&gt;way there would be little trouble with lvl 50&#39;s coming blitzing through<br/>
&gt;dungeons.  It still would happen (if they needed a certain item for<br/>
&gt;themself), but would not be common.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is coming from a player who has benefited greatly from (re)starting<br/>
&gt;the game late in the cycle, thus having equipment well beyond my level<br/>
&gt;capability.  (I am a 17 bard is as much bronze as I can wear, BS mantle,<br/>
&gt;fs spear, dwarven mace, tent whipe, jagged bands).  I would not mind<br/>
&gt;giving that all up for banded/lether a combine sword (which I&#39;ve made<br/>
&gt;plently of money to buy had I wanted one)...  In fact sometime i think I<br/>
&gt;should have started on a new server since I wouldn&#39;t have the option to<br/>
&gt;get this stuff...<br/>
