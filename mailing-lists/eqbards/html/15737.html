What video card(s) are you using?<br/>
<br/>
I have Win2K and EQ on a test machine with an ATI Rage 3d AGP 2X GT-CZUZ and<br/>
the display is 99% unplayable (constant, very bad,  flickering.)<br/>
<br/>
Did you have to do anything to get Direct X 7a installed?<br/>

My system:<br/>
P3-450<br/>
256MB ram<br/>
SCSI U2W harddrives<br/>
Diamond Viper 770 agp<br/>
SB Live! value<br/>
<br/>
I installed W2k in a new drive.  Hit the MS website and found 2 hot fixes<br/>
available for download :)  After installing EQ I launched it and got a<br/>
message saying that no 3D device was found.  So I headed over the the Nvidia<br/>
website and downloaded the newest W2K drivers for the TNT-2.  Installed the<br/>
Nvidia reference drivers and it fired up just fine.  I am having some sound<br/>
problems though.  The sounds are way too load, esp in 3D sound mode.  It is<br/>
do bad I have had to bump my sounds realism down to shut off 3D sound, as<br/>
people walking by me are deafening.  I checkd the SB Live! site and there<br/>
are no new drivers yet for W2k.  Overall it was a pretty painless upgrade<br/>
and it installed alot faster then I thought it would.</div>
