<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434496911">Interesting.  I haven&#39;t experienced this, unless my group was engaged with the<br/>
mob.<br/>
<br/>
But I have noticed that even when healthy, another PC can &#39;scrape off&#39; an angry<br/>
mob on you from a fight that has gone bad.  Wonder why they made the AI<br/>
disregard a person that is killing them to attack a stranger?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

This is normal mob behavior, independent of bards.  If you&#39;re<br/>
heavily wounded, mobs will see you as an &quot;easy kill&quot; and stop<br/>
what they&#39;re doing to finish you off.  I&#39;ve seen a Cazic<br/>
fanatic we were fighting run all the way across the courtyard<br/>
to finish off someone who was almost dead, then run back to<br/>
continue fighting uss.  When we were pulling ice giants, some<br/>
bozo who refused to leave the king area was beaten down to<br/>
under two bubbles by an elite goblin guard, and the giant<br/>
stopped attacking us to finish him off.  I&#39;ve also seen a<br/>
L35ish player in West Commons kill a griffin and live with a<br/>
sliver of health remaining.  A passing bear and orc pawn<br/>
attacked him, even though stuff that level never normally<br/>
aggros on a L35 player.<br/>
