<br/>
At level 30 you are lucky if you can solo anything white+.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t reliably do clops until level 34ish.  Your songs<br/>
just wont stick on a monster at least _FIVE_ levels higher<br/>
than you.  I guess if you hit it right, and got lucky --<br/>
you could chain+bellow the thing, but that&#39;s gonna take about<br/>
20 mins to kill.  If you were refering to charming the HGs,<br/>
I&#39;ve tried it at 39 and it&#39;s very risky, a few resists and<br/>
you could die pretty easily.  I used charm extensively around<br/>
level 30 in highkeep versus red raiders, and it lasted at most<br/>
5 seconds, sometimes less.  Chains+fear on an HG is futile,<br/>
I cannot even do it at level 39.  They still resist too much.<br/>
And if he hits me a few times, hp bubbles vanish.  I have <br/>
gotten lucky, mind you.  But I tend to lean toward statistics<br/>
rather than luck, because in the end you will pay the piper.<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing any other tactics, besides exploits that a level <br/>
30 bard could use?<br/>

Harmonic Distortion, 39th unchained melody.<br/>
League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>
