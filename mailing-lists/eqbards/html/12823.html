<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-542883716">This subject was raised by Rhimshot recently, but because it&#39;s a recurring <br/>
one on this list and on the Concert Hall (and because it&#39;s late at night and <br/>
I&#39;m tired) I&#39;ll limit my comments. = )  Sorry if this comes out incoherently <br/>
- caveat lector.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, around 18th level it becomes very efficient for bards to use <br/>
instruments instead of weapons, weaving CoD/DDD/Hymn and switching <br/>
instruments.  The damage you can deal and heal at that level using a horn <br/>
and lute is very good compared to the hit points and damage dealing <br/>
capacities of the monsters you face.  The problem with bardic damage songs <br/>
is simple, though: our songs increase in damage far slower than our <br/>
opponents gain in hit points, so it will take correspondingly longer for a <br/>
bard to kill monsters every level using only instruments.  When you combine <br/>
this with the fact that monsters do more damage every level on average, <br/>
there&#39;s a finite lifespan to the preference for instrument-only attacks for <br/>
most bards.<br/>
<br/>
By around 25th-30th level (depending on your equipment and the composition <br/>
of your groups) you&#39;ll often find weapons along with (e.g.) anthem, chains, <br/>
psalm to be better overall in terms of how much damage your group sustains <br/>
over the course of a fight.  When you combine this with the fact that there <br/>
are many places (increasingly common at higher levels) where area effect <br/>
attacks will cause a world of hurting to descend on your party, and the fact <br/>
that, should you group with an enchanter, your AE songs will wake the <br/>
sleeping critters, it simply becomes inefficient in most cases to use AE <br/>
songs and instruments at higher levels (35+).  You can still deal a lot of <br/>
damage with these tactics, but you have to decide whether (e.g.) the ~30% <br/>
attack speed slowdown of chains or the attack speed increase of a combat <br/>
buff like Anthem or Celerity won&#39;t cause your party to take less damage over <br/>
the course of a fight.  As you get better weapons and group with tanks who <br/>
can do more damage, and as you fight monsters who hurt you more every time <br/>
they hit, these songs become more and more useful, and the instrument-only <br/>
attack becomes less and less common.<br/>
<br/>
There are of course exceptions to this - maybe you&#39;re in a group with 5 <br/>
clerics fighting hordes of blues - nobody is tanking (but you maybe) and you <br/>
have lots of healing to keep you going.  It then might make sense to deal <br/>
steady damage to everything around and accept the aggroing you&#39;ll draw. = )<br/>
