<div id="ygrps-yiv-501934216">hehe if we&#39;re so overpowered why is it there&#39;s only 2 bards in my guild<br/>
above 30? being me at 50 and another at 56?  Sure we have a couple twinks in<br/>
the teens and 20&#39;s but that&#39;s just that, a twink... Well one of em might be<br/>
leveling up to 50+ since his necro is 60. If we&#39;d be so overpowered the<br/>
populations would be like that of a druid or necro soloers...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>overpowered.  The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>
were true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level advancement <br/>
and ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the flat <br/>
(100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>
great secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards <br/>
can do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>
bard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>
more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>
taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>
of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>
comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
different comparisons, really.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>
with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>
fruits.&quot;<br/>
