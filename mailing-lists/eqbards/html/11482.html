<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728560133">Man, infravision makes a HUGE difference over human vision.  With<br/>
infravision, everything has a reddish tinge (especially when its dark),<br/>
but with human vision you are completly blind when it dark, go to a dark<br/>
zone and see what i mean.  (like Innothule swamp).  Ultravision is even<br/>
better as you see almost the same and day and night, though at night<br/>
everything is bluish...<br/>
