<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427137885">Why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  Well, it might be, if<br/>
Verant didn&#39;t pull this particular answer out of their collective arses<br/>
whenever they are a) too lazy or b) just don&#39;t understand the issue enough<br/>
to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
Notice - they never back this up with - It&#39;s working as intended - &#39;it does<br/>
this and this - BECAUSE&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Verant specializes in giving their customers the perception that they think<br/>
us idiot children. They also specialize in sticking their foot in their<br/>
mouth. How DARE they presume that because they wrote the &#39;code&#39; - that they<br/>
have more &#39;experience&#39; than people that have quite literally put in<br/>
hundreds even collectively hundreds of THOUSANDS of hours into playing and<br/>
testing this class. It is glaringly obvious to even low level bards reading<br/>
some answers that come out that no one there really PLAYS a bard - and no<br/>
one there even UNDERSTANDS the uniqueness of the class. That&#39;s how we get<br/>
nerfed with everyone else - because ya know dude - songs are kinda like<br/>
spells - yet we get missed on enhancements because - ya know dude - bards<br/>
aren&#39;t casters (or insert other class here). <br/>
<br/>
The day they do to my druids snare - what they did bards - is the day I<br/>
QUIT. And shuuuuush - no one tell them druids snare works exactly that way.<br/>
<br/>
I am 41 years old. I do NOT need to have some wet behind the ears, minimum<br/>
wage flunky tell me that I don&#39;t understand a process based on constant<br/>
repetition that I&#39;ve been doing for hundreds of hours. I am not an idiot,<br/>
nor am I a child and I&#39;m sorry - but Verant&#39;s asscovering by intimating<br/>
that somehow we are just too stupid to understand, to lazy to discover or<br/>
even worse somehow SELFISH to want our class to like - not be broken, is<br/>
just about the last straw for me.<br/>
<br/>
Adults hand down pronouncements to children, they DISCUSS with other<br/>
adults. The cause we said so, now sit down and shut up attitude is going to<br/>
have to stop. And it best stop before another viable alternative is<br/>
available. Of course the plus side to it NOT stopping - overcrowding will<br/>
be solved. Course, you may not be able to find anyone left to group WITH.<br/>
<br/>
Working as intended is not a sufficent response to valid complaints that<br/>
backup the complaint with details and descriptions of the problem.  At best<br/>
it&#39;s a half-assed CYA open answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
&gt;amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
&gt;coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>expecting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t like it, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a waste<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards. </span></blockquote></div>
