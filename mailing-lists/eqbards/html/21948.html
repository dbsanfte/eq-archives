that really aren&#39;t. It says mez &quot;stuns&quot; the target, as well as the whirl<br/>
till you hurl line of spells. This is different from the color<br/>
shift/slant/skew line which are really stuns. i.e. you can beat on the mob<br/>
for the duration of the spell without them hitting back.<br/>
<br/>
By 44 enchanters have 3 stuns that are aoe around themselves and can be<br/>
chain cast almost repeatedly for very little mana. Cast time 1-2 sec<br/>
<br/>
Even at 20 however, they have a 4 and 6 sec stun with recast times of 12<br/>
seconds, so they can almost keep a mob nailed down permanently just with<br/>
them.<br/>
