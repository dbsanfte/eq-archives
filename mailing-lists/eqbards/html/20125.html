<div id="ygrps-yiv-329907461">I just can&#39;t seem to level out of 6 *sigh* the problem isn&#39;t finding exp<br/>
giving mobs I can beat of course..the problem is trading equipment. I am<br/>
having such luck at it that it is hard to find the time to go fight things.<br/>
For those interested in trading and money making I will present my current<br/>
tally, please remember, I started on this server with zip, and knowing no<br/>
one: <br/>
<br/>
Level 6.5<br/>
Play time ~2 days<br/>
<br/>
Platinum: 40<br/>
<br/>
Things which I purchased:<br/>
Lumberjack cap (55pp, I think that is way high, but I wanted the look<br/>
*blush*)<br/>
banded mask<br/>
Spiked collar<br/>
small bronze arms<br/>
Lego bracer (better than nothing for now)<br/>
Purity belt<br/>
small bronze grieves<br/>
banded boots(I used to have medium bronze, long story)<br/>
Gnoll hide lariat (10pp!)<br/>
Target shield<br/>
<br/>
Things I found or scavenged:<br/>
Medium bronze BP<br/>
Shin Gauntlets<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things given to me:<br/>
Dwarven tunic (&quot;first newbie to poke me at the newbie lift gets a present&quot;)<br/>
Dervish rings (&quot;first newbie to poke me at the newbie lift gets a present&quot;)<br/>
Pugius 	(after many desperate calls to buy a FS Dagger, <br/>
		offered by a gnome at the bank who would not accept<br/>
payment-heh, <br/>
		offered before I saw I could NOT afford it :o)<br/>
Bloodstained Mantle (drive-by twinking by a troll in LGuk who said he didn&#39;t<br/>
use it any more)<br/>
Collar of undead protection (given by a Squire hunter who refused payment)<br/>
Serpentine Bracer (given by a fellow who offered me a Bracer of Errolissi <br/>
			 for 20p and then didn&#39;t have it anymore)<br/>
<br/>
Things to buy before I am satisfied (for now):<br/>
<br/>
Shiny Brass Shield<br/>
Bracer of Errolissi(sp, sorry)<br/>
small Bronze boots<br/>
Small bronze BP<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To sum up: this is outrageous. All part of being on an old server...only<br/>
this server is not THAT old! However it IS apparently way more generous than<br/>
Povar, I have never seen so many things given away so freely or so often.<br/>
Needless to say I have to explain to people I am NOT twinked, at least, not<br/>
in the common use of the phrase.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...erm...anyone know when a Gnoll Hide Lariat starts procing?<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Server and character name being withheld intentionally, this is a<br/>
sociology experiment as much as it is about me having fun, and being a bit<br/>
secret about it helps. I wouldn&#39;t want someone to give/sell me something (or<br/>
NOT give me something) because I was on this list. *smiles*<br/>
