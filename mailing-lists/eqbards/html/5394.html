&gt;I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>
&gt;loot are exaggerating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading<br/>

Load yourself up with as much plat as you can carry. Run  to cazic thule.<br/>
Offer to buy fine steel weapons for 3 plat for daggers 4 plat for weapons<br/>
 make sure you check what you can sell for first of course). Watch heavily<br/>
weighted players cheer your arrival! Buy until you cant carry anymore.<br/>
Stagger back to oasis or rathe mountains to sell. Repeat over and over again<br/>
until your tired of the whole process. I never did it myself as I would<br/>
rather fight..but on my sever there are several VERY wealthy folks who did<br/>
and are doing this service..and making a killing. Some of them also bring<br/>
food and water and sell them a plat a stack. For me the fun is in the<br/>
hunt..not the merchanting :) Hope you find this helpful!<br/>
