<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061994193">When I was grouping with a druid who I often group with, he asked me to<br/>
keep track of the damage his shield was doing (so he could figure out<br/>
it&#39;s worth).  It was pretty amazing, averaged well more than 2.5 damage<br/>
to mana.  And this was in a less than ideal damage shield situation. <br/>
(there were 2 tanks, plus me, so three people who were taking damage)<br/>
<br/>
In the right situations they are firghteningly effiecient.  If you have<br/>
a single tank character who is taking most of the damage, or a place<br/>
where you pull lots of crappy greens (like unrest), those damage shields<br/>
do scary amounts of damage.  If you are in a &quot;distribute the damage&quot; or<br/>
a burn and med group they are not so good...<br/>
<br/>
Also, it seems to me that the damage from the shield gets credited to<br/>
the tank (for hate list purposes).  If thats true, its a very good<br/>
thing.<br/>
