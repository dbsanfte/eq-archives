&gt;   Also went to Hate this past weekend too.  Only group to break that<br/>
&gt;   post patch on Innoruuk.  We cleared the path to Maestro, which is<br/>
&gt;   about 6 houses or so and the south patrol, however a bugged spite golem<br/>
&gt;   prevented further advancement.  Apparently this golem had it&#39;s pet<br/>
&gt;   trapped in the NE corner.  The golem also blocked the path to clear<br/>
&gt;   anymore, and when pulled it we got 15 mobs.  I played fear and counted<br/>
&gt;   the Screech messages just to see how many were there.  All resisted fear<br/>
&gt;   too, 15 of them.  In the 6 hours we were there, one WAR arms dropped.<br/>
&gt;   That is unacceptible.  But I expected as much from Verant.  The planes<br/>
&gt;   and dragons are a big deathtrap now due to bugs and impossible upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you (the experienced plane and dragon people) are having problems<br/>
with them, how do you think we (the young still impressed by watching a<br/>
sand giant dying people) feel?  By the time I get to lvl 47 (My estimate<br/>
is July of 2005 now) how impossible will it be?  (Not to mention, by<br/>
then a lvl 100 Necro&#39;s Pet will probably be able to solo Vox).  Its<br/>
something thats kind of put a damper on some of our adventuring now that<br/>
we see no long term furute for our group...<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
