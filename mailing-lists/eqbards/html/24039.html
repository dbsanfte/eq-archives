<div id="ygrps-yiv-104076006">If you are in a well balanced group, where every other role is filled by<br/>
someone betetr than you.  (Which must mean you have a shaman and an<br/>
enchanter, at least from my experience), merely play clarity and melee.  You<br/>
will add (30%?, I forgot the percentage) to all the caster&#39;s power, and<br/>
provide some melee damage.  That is a near worst case scenario (IE that is<br/>
the bard baseline of power, you should never dip below that), and in that<br/>
case you are more than holding up your 16.5% (1/6) of the group&#39;s power.<br/>
<br/>
How often are you in an ideal party?<br/>
How often does no one go LD or AFK in an entire session?  (Chances are you<br/>
can fill in for them)<br/>
<br/>
Add this to our ability to solo (which is a component of the net power of a<br/>
class, since there are times you won&#39;t have a group), and I think bards at<br/>
least balanced power wise, probably slightly over powered. (I consider it my<br/>
reward for having a hard class to play).<br/>
<br/>
Add this to our importance on big raids.<br/>
<br/>
Add this to our travel abilities (Best non caster travelers clearly, I&#39;d say<br/>
3rd best traveler overall)<br/>
<br/>
When my guild was folding (been a member since I was 16), I got 4 offers to<br/>
&quot;Come see what our guild is like.&quot; in the first day.  One from a person who<br/>
new me directly, the other 3 from guild leaders who were merely told I was a<br/>
50 bard who knew how to play. (I&#39;m not some super bard, my equipment sucks<br/>
and I still have tons to learn, trying to point out how valued bards are).<br/>
This is partly a function of the rarity of bards, but obviously we are<br/>
valued...</div>
