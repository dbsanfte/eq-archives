<br/>
Anyone notice any difference in the drops in Frontier since the patch?  They<br/>
said they increased the loot, but I haven&#39;t noticed any changes.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know that the loot really needed that much tweaking, certainly hadn&#39;t<br/>
noticed it being radically less than similarly dangerous areas.  Any<br/>
thoughts?<br/>
