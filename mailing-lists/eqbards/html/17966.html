&gt; the ubermobs would be upgraded in level once Kunark comes out.  <br/>
&gt; If they are, then the complaints about our charm being too<br/>

old bard charm wasn&#39;t capped, how did my guildmates know what level<br/>
certain mobs were...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;thinks there&#39;s some showeq stuff going on&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	In any case the point is moot, since bards can&#39;t charm anything in<br/>
sky anymore, except for maybe npc pets.<br/>
