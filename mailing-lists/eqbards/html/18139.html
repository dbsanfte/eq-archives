<div id="ygrps-yiv-539700680">I was on Veesh, Mega, ran across you a couple times but I guess you din&#39;t<br/>
recognize me  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be on Sarynn once it comes up though.  I decided to leave<br/>
Veeshan due to various issues and the server split came at just the right<br/>
time.<br/>
