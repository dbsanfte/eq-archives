<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473861211">I think this statement pretty much sums up everything that I&#39;ve<br/>
  come up with:<br/>
<br/>
  While the bard class itself is nicely balanced, it has and is lacking<br/>
  attention during times when Verant continually adjusts other classes&#39;<br/>
  abilities.  This will inevitably impact bards as their songs are <br/>
  derived from the essence of other classes&#39; traits.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t feel underpowered, (yeah I&#39;ve got a broken song or two,<br/>
  not to mention the handful of missing songs) but I am severely<br/>
  overlooked in the grand scheme of things as a bard.<br/>
