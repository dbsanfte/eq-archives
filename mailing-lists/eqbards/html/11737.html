questions !! You got other girl friends on the side ? No credit here ?<br/>

  Seriously, While I am not in favor of a Bards only Guild for a number<br/>
of previously discussed reasons. I think as we get to higher levels we<br/>
would benefit from some form of loose, grouping association. I read an<br/>
appeal to sever specific Bards from Eci&#39; here. We are lucky because we<br/>
have our own site at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cazic-thule.com/">http://www.cazic-thule.com/</a> and when I just went<br/>
over there and did a search &quot;in the past year&quot; on topics in the &quot;Bard<br/>
Class&quot; forum I only found 10. I will start checking that forum on a<br/>
regular basis. I would love to know who has been good to bards and who<br/>
to avoid, Over the back fence gossip too &lt;snicker&gt; &lt;giggle&gt;.<br/>
