&gt; Subject: Great post on item balancing (Long)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just read this post on the official EQ message boards, an excellent post<br/>
&gt; from Brian Hook regarding how weapons are balanced in EQ:<br/>
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Brian Hook&quot;<br/>
&gt; Since Greg brought it up, I thought I&#39;d write up something about the issue<br/>
&gt; of weapon balance and design, specifically for melee weapons. NOTE: a lot of<br/>
&gt; this is obvious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember Brian back from comp.graphics.alogorithms (IIRC).  He used to be such a putz.  But he has learned much since then.  His<br/>
posts are usually very well thought out (even if you don&#39;t agree with him).  He is a great asset to the Verant team.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Brian said he wasn&#39;t involved with EQ or the expansion directly, but concentrating on future projects (and also not<br/>
Sovereign).  Now there are rumors that Verant is teaming with LucasArts on a MMORPG based in the Star Wars Universe.  I&#39;ll take a<br/>
wild guess and say that Brian Hook is working on the Star Wars game.<br/>
