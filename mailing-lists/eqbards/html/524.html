 </span></blockquote>To follow up on my own message: I was there last night, looking for the <br/>
23rd level song, and found that (at least on Solusek Ro) he has moved. <br/>
 He&#39;s not in front of the picture any more -- he&#39;s in the back room of the <br/>
small library behind the picture.<br/>
