<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642164953"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; required you or your group to venture further into<br/>
&gt; a dungeon in order to find anything to fight.  For<br/>
&gt; example, you enter Befallen and fight your first<br/>
&gt; fight.  In this scenario, the spawn doesn&#39;t reappear<br/>
&gt; until you move on further and fight the next spawn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like an arcade game. What happens if other groups are around and<br/>
want to go into the dungeon? Are they supposed to wait for your group<br/>
to completely heal and finishing medding and move on before they get to<br/>
play? You think camping is bad now? Imagine 6 groups at the entrance to<br/>
a dungeon waiting for the parties before them to move on. Sounds like a<br/>
grocery store check out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The hard part would be determining<br/>
&gt; the order groups got to enter into<br/>
&gt; the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hard is not the word; impossible more like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There would have to be some form<br/>
&gt; of cooperation<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As soon as you find this in any large quantities in EverQuest, let me<br/>
know. I&#39;d love to see it. Visit a Derv camp or Highpass Hold lately?<br/>
Cooperation is non-existant.<br/>
<br/>
People have a finite amount of time to play EverQuest each day/week. I<br/>
for one wouldn&#39;t want to have to wait in line to visit a dungeon or any<br/>
other place that my group wanted to visit.</div>
