those, only 6 combos are playable right now.  Of those, the Jenquai <br/>
Explorer is the most like the Bard of EQ, in that they are travellers, <br/>
capable of going where no others can go, and doing most quests (the <br/>
Tradesman are actually better than explorers at faction stuff).  The JE <br/>
gets several useful skills, including Jumpstart (akin to Ressurect), Cloak <br/>
(invisibility), and Wormhole (Teleport / group teleport).  Though their <br/>
combat skills suffer significantly (much like the Bards) and they do, in <br/>
fact, add little to a group, they are much better as soloists.  Now that I <br/>
think about it - they&#39;re the Druids of EnB ;)  There really isn&#39;t a good <br/>
bard equivalent.<br/>
