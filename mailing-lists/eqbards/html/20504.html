<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059000730">I was there at 12th lvl soloing harpies and drakes. <br/>
An auction came: &quot;6 mino axes for healing two<br/>
fighters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that I joined a 39 Shadowknight and a 37<br/>
warrior as they camped the mino lord.  I played Hymm<br/>
and anthem constantly for the next two hours and left<br/>
with 9 minotaur axes because they were so happy with<br/>
what I did for them.  I was so encumbered that even<br/>
with Selos I was only walking ... something they<br/>
thought was totally hilarius;-)<br/>

&gt; I took the boat from Firiona Vie last night, and<br/>
&gt; after he gave me mega-buffs<br/>
&gt; I had a great conversation with a level 44 Cleric<br/>
&gt; (who also has a level 25<br/>
&gt; bard, little played, but he reads Concery hall and<br/>
&gt; knew his stuff).<br/>
&gt; He suggested that before I go to unrest I spend a<br/>
&gt; level or two in Steamfont,<br/>
&gt; near the Mino caves. I took his suggestion and spent<br/>
&gt; the night fighting a<br/>
&gt; constant stream of beatable blues, it was wonderful.<br/>
&gt; The money is not great,<br/>
&gt; but due to the constant blue spawn exp is really<br/>
&gt; really good. More<br/>
&gt; importantly (for me) you are not fighting the same<br/>
&gt; mob over and over:<br/>
&gt; Harpies, clockworks, lesser drakes, Mino Slavers,<br/>
&gt; Lords and Heros...*laughs*<br/>
&gt; yeah, I saw the Lord just as he spawned in the cave,<br/>
&gt; that didn&#39;t last long<br/>
&gt; :o) The Hero spawned right afterward: *poof* gone. I<br/>
&gt; avoided the elementals,<br/>
&gt; too many hitpoints for the trouble. I AM going to<br/>
&gt; Unrest, but not till this<br/>
&gt; banquet is over :o)<br/>
