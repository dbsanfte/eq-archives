&gt; I&#39;m not a fan of high level characters swooping in and stealing kills -<br/>
&gt; which seems to be what you are describing, but is there really any<br/>
&gt; difference between that and his lower level coming in, plopping down with<br/>
&gt; you for a few hours?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because that guy is lower level than me, I should&#39;ve been able<br/>
to get the stuff before him, and when he went to camp for the<br/>
item it wouldn&#39;t have mattered to me because I&#39;d already have<br/>
the item.  Instead, he&#39;s gotten it before me, and thus dumped<br/>
the camping congestion his item caused onto me when I go to<br/>
get them.  Like I said, cutting in line.<br/>
<br/>
To use your terminology above, a line progresses at x minutes/<br/>
person.  So (given a fixed number of people) a line will<br/>
dissipate in the same amount of time no matter how the order<br/>
is shuffled.  But you can&#39;t deny that people in the middle<br/>
have a legitimate gripe if someone in front gives their<br/>
friends (secondary characters) in back a cut to the front.<br/>
Calling them jealous because someone behind them got to go to<br/>
the front is just plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I see far more often happen is that a player will give his lower level<br/>
&gt; characters, or friends, his hand-me-down items once he has better - which<br/>
&gt; is a GOOD thing in terms of NOT having to camp for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, this stuff I don&#39;t have much problem with, though as I&#39;ve<br/>
said it should be limited to items appropriate for the level<br/>
if you don&#39;t want to lessen the gaming experience.  I do it<br/>
with abandon just to save them some of the grief I went<br/>
through to get some of my items.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And yes, too many people simply have not learned the difference between<br/>
&gt; single-player, and multi-player games. That is at the heart of a lot of<br/>
&gt; problems online worlds have. Perhaps society is just tuned into ME ME ME,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;ve met folks that had utter and total disregard for PEOPLE around<br/>
&gt; them, treating them all no better than your average NPC. It&#39;s a big sandbox<br/>
&gt; folks, we can all play nice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said in the other OT thread, I think this problem will<br/>
start to disappear as virtual worlds start to gain legitimacy,<br/>
and people start to think of them more as a theme park like<br/>
Disneyland, instead of a game.<br/>
