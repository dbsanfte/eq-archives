<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340388866">So are we in agreement that this should be part of the balancing <br/>
issues for high level bards?  I think that this is an excellent point <br/>
that should be brought up.  At the same time we can confirm if the <br/>
soft cap is truth or rumor.  That is of course if the balance <br/>
discussions are still open.  <br/>
<br/>
Not it.  LOL!<br/>
