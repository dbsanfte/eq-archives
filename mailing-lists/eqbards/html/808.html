both, it&#39;s probably camped.<br/>

If you do hunt in Steamfont, I&#39;d also recommend trying the<br/>
initial passage in the minotaur caves (before it splits into<br/>
three).  A minotaur often spawns just inside, and if you get a<br/>
train (2+ minotaurs, though I was able to take two solo at<br/>
L14), you can always kick in the afterburners and run for the<br/>
guard near the windmills.  Minotaurs tend to have a little<br/>
better loot, and about one in ten has an axe that sells for<br/>
3pp (vendor) to 5pp (players).<br/>
<br/>
I used to draw them out of the cave (so more wouldn&#39;t drop on<br/>
top of me), and fought near the mountains (so other monsters<br/>
outside wouldn&#39;t jump me).  If you start to lose a fight, you<br/>
can either run for the guards, or run around for a bit with<br/>
both Accelerando and the healing song playing until you think<br/>
you can finish him off.  Careful where you run though as being<br/>
&quot;in combat&quot; tends to attract giant disease rats.  I usually<br/>
stuck close to the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
If you do decide to venture in deeper, try to avoid going too<br/>
far in (especially the far left passage).  Meldrath (a L53<br/>
necromancer I hear) lives inside and casts some nasty spells<br/>
on you through the walls.  The worst, which thankfully has<br/>
never happened to me, is charm, at which point you will<br/>
merrily waltz into his lair to die, leaving your corpse<br/>
unrecoverable.<br/>
