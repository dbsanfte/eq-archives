<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131064091">I spent a little time fighting gargoyles in the OOT a few levels ago...<br/>
they&#39;re just about at level 20-22 or so.  About every 5 or 6 gargoyles,<br/>
they drop a gargoyle eye or two, worth almost 10pp with good charisma.<br/>

&gt; Welcome!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think you got your GZ answer?  You read the response we got from him on<br/>
&gt; som ebard questions - his sig was at the bottom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The gargoyles are found in the Ocean of Tears (take the boat from Freeport<br/>
&gt; and it sails through OOT).  I do not have first hand experience with them<br/>
&gt; but a monk friend had been to visit them and he is about 20ish.  He trained<br/>
&gt; the giant skels to the Gargs and feigned i guess.  Then let the Garg and<br/>
&gt; Skel duke it out.  Then he recoved and killed the weakened Garg.  Not sure<br/>
&gt; you could handle them at level 12 - i got the feeling they were higher level<br/>
&gt; but really dont know.<br/>
