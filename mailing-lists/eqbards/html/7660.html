<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946878457">Coming from a warrior here, I do not want my class to be able to bind, nor<br/>
any other melee based class either (yes, that includes bards). What I do<br/>
want is to be Bound anywhere, not have that ability to do it myself. I want<br/>
to be able to go to guk and get my buddy to bind me at the zoneline, same as<br/>
he would do to me in the city. As a warrior, without equip I am useless<br/>
(reality). No songs, no invis, nada. So instead of respawning and ready to<br/>
get back to having fun playing turns into the 20 minute &#39;use the force<br/>
Kragan&#39; blind mans run during night from FP to Lower guk. I get attacked by<br/>
a giant or spectre along the way, I die if I cant hop fast enough.  For fun<br/>
(Hah) one day, make a human at nightime and try to run from FP to Guk, its<br/>
rates no where up there with &#39;tanking 4 mobs to save party&#39; or &#39;being able<br/>
to play that extra 20 mins for the rare to spawn&#39;. Rates right beside &#39;all<br/>
the kewl doods messaging me when I am hungover&#39;.<br/>
Binding is the province of the casters, but being bound anywhere should not<br/>
be thier right alone. You know as well as I that at the higher levels, no<br/>
tank means no party in dungeons. So while I am not playing for that 20 mins,<br/>
they are not playing for that 20 mins.<br/>
I would even support a change in binding so that it can only occur outdoors,<br/>
and make that stick for everyone. For example, use the same code idea as for<br/>
SoW. Can&#39;t cast SoW indoors, cant cast bind indoors. Will some people have<br/>
to adjust? For sure, but it is not as hard a move as it seems. The ones that<br/>
will bitch are casters that usually set a bind point to a particular mob so<br/>
they can farm it (EE, EXG, Ancient, you get the idea). They arent being<br/>
forced to make the long runs back, just a zone in to be back. The upside to<br/>
this would be more total playtime for everyone. Tanks die, go get them at<br/>
the zone entrance, carry on with trying to have fun. And the xp penalty does<br/>
hurt, and you cant make that up in a real hurry either. Died last night in<br/>
lord room and lost almost a full bub of final hell (45) xp. Took a good 6<br/>
hours to regain that.<br/>
Dieing is one thing, but dieing and making the run back can only further<br/>
aggravte one at times. Especially if a caster dies as well, has time to get<br/>
body back, remem all spells, and is ready for more play while you are still<br/>
running across first zone.<br/>
I guess what it all boils down to is this; Only casters get to bind, but<br/>
allow everyone else to be bound anywhere. As it stands now, if I die twice<br/>
in an evening and have to make the long run, I no longer feel like playing<br/>
the melee class, and switch chars to a caster class where if I die, it takes<br/>
2 mins to get back to body.<br/>
