<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-751811599">Back during beta I once had a chance to ask Brad about the subject of DE <br/>
Bards.  They are no there due to the fact that they consider bards to be a a <br/>
neutral to good class.<br/>
Also a funny thing about the Drizzt&#39;s all over the place, I saw a guy on <br/>
Karana named Drizzt D&#39;Vinn. Haha, talk about a lack of imagination.<br/>

&gt; &gt;1) I feel that dark elves should have the bard class open to them.<br/>

&gt;I have no opinion on the question but would offer some insight into how to<br/>
&gt;answer it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps this is true, but my experience with live roleplaying rules systems<br/>
&gt;says that your arguments must be based on out of game reasoning and<br/>
&gt;balance, not in-game culture, history, and racial characteristics.  In-game<br/>
&gt;reasoning does have importance and must be considered, but since we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;creating an artificial world out-of-game constraints must take precedence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If there is any chance of persuading Verant to open the bard class to dark<br/>
&gt;elves, the argument must be based on game balance.  Once you have a<br/>
&gt;persuasive position there, inventing the in-game explanations for the way<br/>
&gt;things are is easy and fun and somewhat unnecessary, since people will do<br/>
&gt;it themselves even if you supply canned explanations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The biggest problem with accomplishing your goal is prying information out<br/>
&gt;of Verant.  They may have the killer out-of-game argument for the way<br/>
&gt;things are or they may not have thought very deeply about it.  Making that<br/>
&gt;sort of determination in the face of Verant&#39;s general lack of communication<br/>
&gt;will be somewhere between difficult and impossible unless you can find the<br/>
&gt;right nerve to hit and actually get a response as we do from J.M. on some<br/>
&gt;topics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally, I find attempts to communicate with Verant extremely<br/>
&gt;frustrating.  For the most part people there, including J.M., don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;acknowledge most questions or suggestions, so you have no clue when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;even listening, much less what light they may be able to shed.<br/>
