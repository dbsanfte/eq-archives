<div id="ygrps-yiv-122551381">I personally micro Melee Attack and the rest songs in my first bank because<br/>
it is so much easier keeping 2 songs going at once if your have then hot<br/>
keyed.  For forage and sense and inventory keys i have in my second bank<br/>
because hey, once i hit accelo to escape all i have to do is hit Shift 2,<br/>
and there is my drum and lets face it, hehe, u can&#39;t forage while fighting<br/>
so in my opinion it is wasting valuable space having it hotkeyed in your<br/>
first bank.... plus i usually don&#39;t forage until i&#39;m safe in some corner or<br/>
behind some tree resting with restoration echoing across the server....<br/>
these are just my opinions off course...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ReeceT@...">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wondering<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>
&gt;only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>
&gt;banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>
&gt;buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>
&gt;can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>
&gt;them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>
&gt;for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>
&gt;two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>
&gt;worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>
&gt;continually click on it in between combats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>
&gt;mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin<br/>
