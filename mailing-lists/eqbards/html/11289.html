<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740880959">Heh heh, even attempting that now would get you stunned so many times you<br/>
would never take another step.  I find that the current functionality<br/>
appears to be:  Mob nods, 50% of the time mob sleeps.  Not bad on a lone<br/>
mob, for crowd control, useless.  Ok, worse than useless as you get so<br/>
aggro&#39;d to the mob they ignore the tanks and run over to beat on you.  Yeah<br/>
my bard is not a tank, he just plays one on EQ.<br/>

&gt; Wouldn&#39;t know - been playing since day two of release, and am still only<br/>
&gt; 20th level.  I guess I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t try to powerlevel up, so I could<br/>
&gt; have actually used some of the songs before they nerfed them to<br/>
uselessness.<br/>
&gt; Of course, they seem to have fixed others, so maybe I still have something<br/>
&gt; to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
They nerfed it well before release I&#39;m afraid. To get an idea of how<br/>
well it worked in beta, check out this screenshot I saved from my BB<br/>
days in P4.<br/>
