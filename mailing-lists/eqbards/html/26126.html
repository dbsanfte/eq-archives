<div id="ygrps-yiv-758002002">Hi,<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  My name is Don J. S. Adams,<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Im a research scientist thats been working on a new emerging technology that uses sound frequencies to promote optimal mental states, hand eye coordination, intuition and fast<br/>
  accurate decision making.<br/>
  Im interested in working with a good group of gamers who are willing to play these sound frequencies in the back ground while they play. I&#39;d like to get feedback on what they notice.<br/>
  I anticipate, that very concrete, fast results will be noticed by gamers dramatically.<br/>
  Essentially what these frequencies do, is literally act in a similiar fashion conceptually to some of the &#39;magic potions&#39;, &#39;elixirs&#39;, &#39;vials&#39;, often found in the game that somehow augments the character,<br/>
  or role. Except in this case, this &#39;sound frequency elixir&#39;, literally augments you. Various<br/>
  aspects of your consciousness will be improved, strengthened and optimized.<br/>
  You should be able to dramatically improve your game and notice how much greater your<br/>
  &quot;in the zone&quot; flow is.<br/>
  If you are interested in volunteering to help in my study of this or would like more info, let me know. Im happy to post more information on this to the group here but wanted to respectfully ask first if this was of interest.<br/>
  Alternatively, please feel free to inquire further to ;<br/>

  Please let me know in your emails subject header that you are interested in the gaming study I am sponsoring....<br/>

  One other thing, if you are &#39;addicted&#39; to the game to much, then these sound frequencies may be of further interest to you.<br/>
  Ironically, I suspect these energetic frequency patterns are craved by addicts and they may be trying to fill this craving at times via the game, but the sound frequencies actually may fill this void in a healthy way, and yet ironically may actually improve game play.<br/>
