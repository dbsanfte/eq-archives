<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526114920">I believe you when you say a GM gave out a warning there.  But I bet what<br/>
the GM was talking to them about was safe-zoning* Herman - which is easy to<br/>
do there.  Our party was attacking him and dragging him out to fight in the<br/>
yard.  It was a melee fair and square - other than me not letting him get<br/>
his thorns up &lt;eg&gt; and I don&#39;t think that is cheating any more than sitting<br/>
in the middle of an orc camp where you know exactly where the spawns are<br/>
gonna happen.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I demo&#39;d the technique to my party: AE on Herman and then back<br/>
up so he gets hung up trying to come thru the wall at you.  Then you can<br/>
stand out of melee range and DoT him.  I _could_ solo him that way - if it<br/>
would not put me to sleep in a big hurry - which it does.  So we fought him<br/>
in the open until we got bored and then moved on.  <br/>
<br/>
This game is not fun unless you are risking your life.  There&#39;s a ton of<br/>
stuff you can do that&#39;s incredibly boring.  Like pottery before they nerfed<br/>
it.  But even the one night I tried to learn pottery I managed to get<br/>
killed! (Auto-attacked a merch)  That was it for me.  If I am gonna git<br/>
killed I want to have some fun doing it!<br/>

		Someone one the Bard Board posted their experience with<br/>
taking on the Hermit<br/>
		too.  They were doing exactly what you&#39;re proposing, sitting<br/>
and blasting an<br/>
		AOE song that the Hermit would spawn into.  The were<br/>
repremanded by a GM<br/>
		(after the GM killed the Hermit) and told that it was an<br/>
exploit and not to<br/>
		repeat the behavior.  Personally I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s an<br/>
exploit, but I&#39;m<br/>
		just informing you that that&#39;s what happened to that one guy<br/>
on that one<br/>
		server with that one GM.  Your mileage may vary.<br/>
