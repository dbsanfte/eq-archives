<div id="ygrps-yiv-491816152">I have found level 12 heaven. <br/>
<br/>
I took the boat from Firiona Vie last night, and after he gave me mega-buffs<br/>
I had a great conversation with a level 44 Cleric (who also has a level 25<br/>
bard, little played, but he reads Concery hall and knew his stuff).<br/>
He suggested that before I go to unrest I spend a level or two in Steamfont,<br/>
near the Mino caves. I took his suggestion and spent the night fighting a<br/>
constant stream of beatable blues, it was wonderful. The money is not great,<br/>
but due to the constant blue spawn exp is really really good. More<br/>
importantly (for me) you are not fighting the same mob over and over:<br/>
Harpies, clockworks, lesser drakes, Mino Slavers, Lords and Heros...*laughs*<br/>
yeah, I saw the Lord just as he spawned in the cave, that didn&#39;t last long<br/>
:o) The Hero spawned right afterward: *poof* gone. I avoided the elementals,<br/>
too many hitpoints for the trouble. I AM going to Unrest, but not till this<br/>
banquet is over :o)<br/>
