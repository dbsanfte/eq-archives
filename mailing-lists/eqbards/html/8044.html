<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132682294">Heh well then you have to talk with some 40+ people some more. You have to<br/>
have a basic understanding of what every class can do at high levels to take<br/>
things on. Besides which you don&#39;t learn much in the early levels.<br/>

&gt;&gt; The thing is that people who are really decked out pretty much understand<br/>

&gt;You have a basic understanding of every class.  There&#39;s no way<br/>
&gt;you can have the kind of intimate understanding that comes<br/>
&gt;from having played and died over and over.  Heck, most of the<br/>
&gt;people I meet don&#39;t even know what songs/spells the other<br/>
&gt;classes have aside from the most commonly used ones.  The only<br/>
&gt;people I&#39;ve seen with a good understanding of (most) every<br/>
&gt;class and their limits and so forth are the ones who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;somehow had enough time to get four or five diverse characters<br/>
&gt;past the mid 20s or so.<br/>
