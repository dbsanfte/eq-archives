<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-89288085">Ok, I see your point.  Fierce Brewing was somewhat ridiculous, I agree, but<br/>
at least it offset my expenses.  It actually -costs- me money to be a brewer<br/>
now, quite a bit since I experiment and have a lot of waste.  No<br/>
experimenting, with failures at master level, I&#39;ll end up actually spending<br/>
more to make the highest skill or lowest skill drinks than what I&#39;ll<br/>
actually get back.<br/>
<br/>
Fine, then I should sell to players, lets assume there was an actual demand.<br/>
Well, a player can buy the cheapest drink from an NPC bartender over a PC<br/>
Brewer, paying 3 times less, or even more if the PC actually wanted to make<br/>
a slight profit!  Most brewers give their wares away free, regardless,<br/>
really making this truely an expensive hobby, a hobby, not a trade.  With<br/>
Fierce Brewing, was nice because I could give away drinks, experiment, and<br/>
at least break even.  Was nice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all philosophy I suppose.  Some think that the only way one should<br/>
advance in any way whatsoever is through killing, rinse, killing.  Quests,<br/>
diversion.  Trades, diversion.  I think it would make the world much more<br/>
diverse if every member of society didn&#39;t have to play the part of the<br/>
ultimate hero.<br/>

and sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>
getting drunk anyway.<br/>
