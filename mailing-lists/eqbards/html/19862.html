<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459621790">Ok, maybe I just got lucky, but I went on my first plane raid (Hate) <br/>
this weekend, and put to use some information from the list. We were <br/>
getting ready to fight the Maestro, and I was placed in the <br/>
main &quot;tank&quot; group -- 4 tanks, a cleric, and a bard. Since I had never <br/>
fought the Maestro before, and had NO idea what to expect, the others <br/>
started giving me a briefing... seems he has an AOE life drain. Then <br/>
I remembered a conversation from this list about life drain being a <br/>
poison based effect, so I asked for my group to be PR and DR buffed <br/>
as well as MR. I then selected purifying rhythms instead of elemental <br/>
(with the lag, I was having a real hard time doing more than two <br/>
songs), and got ready for battle.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, we lost no one, and after the fight, I <br/>
received a lot of comments about how little damage everyone took. <br/>
(They were all quite happy with their 250+ MR and 150+PR/DR.) We <br/>
fought him a second time, and I played the same songs with the same <br/>
results (I also passed the tip on to another Bard who was going to <br/>
play elemental, and after the fight, she sent me thanks for the tip <br/>
and said her group also took a lot less damage than she was <br/>
expecting.)<br/>
<br/>
So... with two slayings of Maestro, I was lucky and lost no party <br/>
members. Maybe we were all just REALLY lucky, or maybe there IS <br/>
something to the PR/DR for lifetap. Anyway, we made it, and thanks <br/>
for the info!</div>
