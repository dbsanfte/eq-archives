<b>Subject:</b> Lowest price possible on medium steel <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083621900">It is my knowledge that steel plate can only be bought from vendors generally (unless someone is upgrading and wishes to sell their old plate, right??) I was just wondering what the minimun price would be for medium steel plate, and what charisma/faction it takes for that??</div>
