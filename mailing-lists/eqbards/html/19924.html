<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676429571">Nope I&#39;m not goin back to the Test server without my items and levels back.<br/>
Sorry, some of the stuff I got is near impossible to get there.  Do you have<br/>
ANY idea how hard it is to get enough folks together to do naggy on test?<br/>
Or to do a hate break?<br/>
<br/>
hehe NA GA DA!  Not gonna do it!<br/>
<br/>
Bubye Test Server :(<br/>
<br/>
It was already bad enough living in mortal terror of getting a corpse stuck<br/>
in a wall.  (seriously, no GM&#39;s and no high level mages = Lost corpse & all<br/>
items)  Happened to me twice<br/>
<br/>
Not goin back.  Just aint worth the frustration.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Player wipe on Test<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ouch! :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt; was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt; conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
&gt; from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>
&gt; on:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>
&gt; their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>
&gt; stinks nonetheless.<br/>
