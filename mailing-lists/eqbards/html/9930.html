That is their number ONE complaint - they get TOO good, and the list is not<br/>
sortable, you can&#39;t ignore anything or sort it - and soon are getting<br/>
flooded with the whole zone of NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
Tracking is the one skill I wish I had now, only lvl 23, I want tracking<br/>
nearly as much as I want our lvl 32 song.<br/>

&gt;Hehe I been with rangers who wish they could track only as good as us!  They<br/>
&gt;dont like seeing crap that is clear across the zone andprefer to see stuff<br/>
&gt;that is fairly close by.  Guess Verant had a real &quot;wizard&quot; design ranger<br/>
&gt;tracking. </span></blockquote></div>
