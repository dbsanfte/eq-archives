<div id="ygrps-yiv-623597867">The dirk is the best weapon you can get for free at such a low lvl too. I<br/>
was wondering if anyone can give me hint as to the gnoll that carry a<br/>
Tomahawk and what lvl is it?  I am currently lv 19.  I just want to know at<br/>
what lvl should I start getting a group together and go and kill it.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, a combine weapon is magical. They are nice weapons, but what you should<br/>
really look into getting is a Dragoon Dirk. If my database of weapons is<br/>
up-to-date, it would appear that there is only ONE combine weapon better<br/>
than the Dirk....The 2 Handed Combine Sword. All I can say is...DIRK ROCKS.<br/>
I just had the absolute BEST fortune to pick one up for free last night. I<br/>
think I will be very happy with it indeed...<br/>
