 </span></blockquote>They&#39;d have to use yellow, since you could conceivably use /shout instead of<br/>
say to get a red roll.  I&#39;m sure the zone would wonder what you&#39;re doing,<br/>
but they might just think you rolled while close to them, as we see roll&#39;s<br/>
in white show up from other groups all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s impossible to set up a macro this long, so the cheater would have<br/>
to type it each and every time.<br/>
