<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033557681">I can see both sides of the point here.  I usually want to help whenever I<br/>
can and admit I have even foolishly helped someone get their corpse from the<br/>
heart of the Ogre Camp.  I didn&#39;t die, but I probably should have.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
many people were amazed who saw this lone bard racing across W Karana with 8<br/>
or so ogres in tow.  I let them take a rest stop at guard tower number two<br/>
while I raced on to the zone.  I imagine they made short work of the poor<br/>
guards there, but hey that&#39;s why they get hazard pay!  Hopefully they paused<br/>
at tower one or their way as well, &#39;cause after I zoned back in from Q Hills<br/>
the remains of their angry band were meandering back towards the camp.  Its<br/>
amazing how easy it is to loot a body in the middle of a now empty ogre<br/>
camp, no one goes near the place to bother you!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How would others have handled this situation?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly as you did. There&#39;s no bank there to store<br/>
your items in. There&#39;s absolutely NO reason for you<br/>
to have put yourself in jeopardy like that. If it<br/>
was a friend, I would have gone to Qeynos, banked my<br/>
stuff and came back - but for someone you just know<br/>
by seeing occasionally, and you were getting ready<br/>
to log out? &quot;Best wishes..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two corpses are worse than one.<br/>

&gt; like just because we can located we&#39;re somehow<br/>
&gt; *obligated* to do so regardless of the<br/>
&gt; circumstances or dangers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask someone to<br/>
help me retrieve my corpse in a horribly dangerous<br/>
situation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>
I asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>
them what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>
even answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>
they backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>
there. I thanked him and let him go. No use making <br/>
him die too.<br/>
