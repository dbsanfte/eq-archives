What happens is this.  Have you ever out run one of<br/>
the Beetles?  I have, it gets bored and forgets <br/>
about me.  But it tells its friends.  And the next<br/>
time I&#39;m any where close to ANY of the same type<br/>
of MOB they pouce.  I&#39;ve seen this happen with<br/>
the Beetles and Ghouls of North Karana.</div>
