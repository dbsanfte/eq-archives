<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358884298">Ok, if you&#39;re even considering entrance to HS, I&#39;m assuming (forgive me<br/>
hehe) that you&#39;re 45+ *at least.*  The frogs in the tunnel with Durgaz are<br/>
green, but I&#39;m not sure at what level. Don&#39;t attack Durgoz however. Clear<br/>
the cave of the gaz knights and/or krup or whatever guards him.  I read it<br/>
on allakhazam I believe, that he is their slave, and will not speak or aid<br/>
others while they exist. Kill them, he will not aggro. Once you have done<br/>
this, even at dubious, he will give you the HS Key as a reward. To be sure,<br/>
follow his text, to get him to schpeel about the fang and the spear of the<br/>
Chancellor.<br/>
<br/>
I did it just this past Sunday morning with no complications, alone even.<br/>
Don&#39;t try to go into Charasis alone, hoping to find a group though!! LOL<br/>
