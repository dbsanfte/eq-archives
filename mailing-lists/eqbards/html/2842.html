<b>Subject:</b> Two of the same weapon <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601610973">For roleplaying sake there should only be one of each unique monster and<br/>
weapon.  Once you kill Dvinn or Crush, they should be dead and you get their<br/>
equipment.  They would not come back to life to spawn more equipment for<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Bu this is a MMPORPG.  You cannot restrict the monster or item to just one<br/>
person.  Therefore he spawns again, giving someone else a chance to kill<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
The Lore Item is a way to restrict people from continuous camping.  The idea<br/>
is that others would then have a chance to kill the monster and get the<br/>
weapon.<br/>

&gt; What&#39;s the big deal with people wanting 2 of the same item?<br/>
&gt; Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>
&gt; delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter<br/>
&gt; windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>
&gt; different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
