<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642251788">A couple of comments on this thread - as a programmer who&#39;s written and<br/>
supported applications with upwards of 150 users.  While a much smaller user<br/>
base than EQ - on the other hand one of them systems reconciled bank<br/>
accounts that occasionally had 11 digits...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t hold it against Verant that patches take longer than they predicted.<br/>
That often happened to me.  I don&#39;t hold it against them that they had to<br/>
delay the upgrade a day or two after they first thought they&#39;d be ready as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why they can&#39;t do it at the most off-peak time available.<br/>
It&#39;s policy at the company I worked for never create down-time for users<br/>
during business hours - even in applications with one or two users who only<br/>
use the once or twice a week...<br/>

&gt; &gt; What, you expect the Verant folks to get up at 2am?? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most definitly if their work involves completly shutting down the<br/>
&gt; servers that over 200,000 people pay to use.  Stores do inventory in the<br/>
&gt; middle of night so they don&#39;t have to close down.  I personally come to<br/>
&gt; work at all kinds of crazy hours so our network at work does not have<br/>
&gt; downtime when people are trying to do their jobs.  Its part of my job.<br/>
