&gt;     Wow!  Can&#39;t say enough good things about the exp mi... err goblin mine <br/>
&gt;&lt;g&gt; in Ill Omen.  Went there on a tip from a guildmate at 29 Friday night, <br/>
&gt;and am now halfway to 31 (and that&#39;s with studying for finals, *and* <br/>
&gt;getting a tp to WC to go buy songs in FP, HPH, and Qeynos, then <br/>
&gt;insta-porting back to Kunark via the Qeynos Arena and a helpdul young <br/>
&gt;warrior.    heeheehee).  Even though the warlords still give good <br/>
&gt;experience, the other critters are kinda slow :o/<br/>
&gt;     So, any ideas on where I can go next for great solo exp?  I&#39;ld like to <br/>
&gt;hang around Kunark so I can be here for 32, and weasel my way  (using <br/>
&gt;manasong as leverage :op  ) into one of the Karnor groups getting all the <br/>
&gt;nifty bard items.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try the area near the zone(s) in Frontier Mountains.  If you zone in from <br/>
Lake of Ill Omen near the Sarnak Fortress, go straight until the ground <br/>
drops.  Head down the slope and park off to the right.  From the relatively <br/>
flat area near the two big stones you can pull almost non-stop with a good <br/>
group.  You will be killing Mountain Giants, Burnai&#39;s (moles), Beasts <br/>
(apes), and goblins (necro ones (bonecallers) are nasty as are the cleric <br/>
ones (cenobites)).  The exp will fly too.  I made it through 33 in about 2-3 <br/>
days (maybe 15 hours total) fighting BLUES mind you...<br/>
<br/>
In that time frame we also killed four of the MG&#39;s with 2H weapons with <br/>
goofy names... hehe  I ended up with a 2HS pick that&#39;s bard-usable, but of <br/>
course our 2HS skills never improve from 1.  The MG Tumps rarely drop Tump <br/>
Stumps which are used in the Druidic Beguile Plant spell quest.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, pull carefully and you will rake in the exp.  Of course the zone is <br/>
right near by in case you don&#39;t pull carefully... =8^)<br/>
