<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484416546">Hmm the parser I use has the ability to attach logfiles to a character for<br/>
processing.  It appends them together to keep a full record unless you<br/>
delete them after processing.  This parser has some interesting abilities<br/>
but they don;t seem to work properly for bards.  The two I use are<br/>
Eqcharinfo and eqparser I think, but I don&#39;t remember offhand which is<br/>
which.<br/>
<br/>
Shows how much I pay attention.  I forgot the number appears in the line<br/>
when you are informed of skill increases.  One of these parsers also keeps<br/>
track of every item you ever get a price on from a vendor.  I found that<br/>
useful for seeing where I get the best prices.<br/>

&gt; When you set up the parser (assuming it is the one I use) you assigned a<br/>
&gt; character and set him up.  Obviously it reads your inventory screen info<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Nope, no setup.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; skill info somehow as it knows that 1 HS +1 raised the skill to 99 for<br/>
&gt; example.  I assume it picks up the other info on level and race the same<br/>
&gt; way, from the other screens.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty easy - the server spits out a line that says<br/>
&quot;You have become better at 1 handed slashing (99)&quot; that&#39;s<br/>
recorded in the logfile.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a link to different parsers?  Maybe there&#39;s<br/>
one that&#39;ll same me some of the work I&#39;m doing.<br/>
