<div id="ygrps-yiv-409303709">Depending on the situation, i switch out the evensong/sixnote/orb of tishan<br/>
depending on what i want. I almost never use my dual ykeshas, not after<br/>
seeing the sustained damage that the 11/25 weapons do. You almost, almost<br/>
feel like you are actually contributing to the fight with them ;)<br/>

&gt;  Maestro of Rancor dropped the Evensong on Saturday night.  Second <br/>
&gt;  one on our server to my knowledge.  I know the bard with the first<br/>
&gt;  drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Members of the Pantheon killed him after they themselves had perished <br/>
&gt;  twice to the bugger and us once.  I swear the guy was doing donuts <br/>
&gt;  around the plane looking for people to kill.  That, and the 4 mob<br/>
&gt;  train he was carrying around with him didn&#39;t help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Needless to say, I was the only bard on the plane at the time.<br/>
&gt;  Unfortunately, I have to wait until Maestro drops another, since<br/>
&gt;  the weapon was &#39;accidentally&#39; looted by someone who cannot use it.<br/>
&gt;  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Do you use your evensong over your yk, Shada?<br/>
