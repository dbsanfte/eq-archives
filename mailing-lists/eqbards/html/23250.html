<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862740872">heh i didn&#39;t know the quest mob dropped the key, if that&#39;s what you mean.<br/>
and that must be the dragon in skyshrine?  at the time, i was keeping up<br/>
dragon faction, now that has changed but couldn&#39;t kill him to get the key.<br/>
and it happened to be one of the most fun things i have done.  first killing<br/>
for pla, then sneaking and invising and praying i could trade with the<br/>
questgiver without getting killed was a blast.<br/>

&gt; camped it once and gave out a bunch of keys.<br/>
