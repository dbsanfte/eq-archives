<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132756288">Does killing tougher things increase faction more?  Like the difference<br/>
between killing a goblin and a goblin shaman, for example?  Same faction<br/>
hits and increases, just wondering if it was larger?<br/>

9th.  At 11th, I&#39;m experiencing the land of diminishing returns, so I will<br/>
probably move on soon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, in this case, the quest specifically ASKS you to go outside and beat<br/>
something&#39;s head in.  The necklaces are just to prove that you did.<br/>
