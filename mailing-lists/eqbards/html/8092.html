<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969893960">Yup, use the multispeaker setting... EQ will utilize the sblive effects to <br/>
its best ability (the game&#39;s EAX isn&#39;t great like Thief or System Shock 2, <br/>
but it is servicable)... the other auto presets will add varying degrees of <br/>
reverb and the like which may distort the environmental audio for a game <br/>
designed to take advantage of it...<br/>
<br/>
Incidently, EQ has decent side to side environmental audio (I can hear <br/>
footsteps walk from my left to my right) but it&#39;s forward/back environmental <br/>
audio seems a bit... wrong... does anyone else with a four speaker setup and <br/>
sblive find this to be true?  All other EAX games demonstrate proper audio <br/>
positioning, so I&#39;m almost positive it is isolated to EQ... this is on a <br/>
four-speaker setup...<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW this is off-topic Talies, but it is sound related, and as bards we <br/>
should be concerned with it... yeah... uh huh... thats it... &lt;treading <br/>
lightly around a large kabong, hopefully&gt;<br/>

So are you saying the standard &quot;Multi Speaker&quot; setting is the best setting<br/>
to use?  If not, which one?<br/>
