<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689617976">Just a point here.  While EQ does not support all of<br/>
the newer features in video technology (and you  can<br/>
reference Brad&#39;s interview discussed yesterday...), a<br/>
lot of the newer cards sport advanced redering<br/>
techniques and better processors.  <br/>
<br/>
So even if EQ doesn&#39;t support everything the card<br/>
does, a newer, more advanced card will usually run<br/>
graphics faster than an older card.<br/>

&gt; &gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup<br/>
&gt; over a TNT2,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you<br/>
&gt; see in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; reviews.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why?<br/>
&gt; Because my brother <br/>
&gt; in law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife<br/>
&gt; has the same setup <br/>
&gt; with a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my<br/>
&gt; GeForce at 1024X768 <br/>
&gt; that they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There<br/>
&gt; is a HUGE <br/>
&gt; performance increase that is VERY noticable if you<br/>
&gt; have your <br/>
&gt; computers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24<br/>
&gt; person raid on Kedge <br/>
&gt; Keep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off,<br/>
&gt; same setup on <br/>
&gt; all 3 computers and they were both lagging and had<br/>
&gt; much much lower <br/>
&gt; frame rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at<br/>
&gt; 1024x768 as I <br/>
&gt; would have been had I been the only one in the zone.<br/>
