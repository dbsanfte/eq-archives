<div id="ygrps-yiv-623910572">Hmm, &quot;ancient & ruined library&quot; could be the one in Kaesora.  Off hand I<br/>
dont recall a loom in the library but maybe.  There is a spot near the<br/>
library called &quot;the loom room&quot; but the times i was there, i did not click it<br/>
to see if it would do anything - so i guess it&#39;s entirely possible.  But<br/>
there are librarys in a few kunark dungeons, iirc - one in Seb as well as<br/>
kaesora and Dalnir&#39;s iirc.  Dronga/Nurga def possibilities as well.<br/>

&gt; You say, &#39;hail Dionin Needlespin&#39;<br/>

&gt; Greetings my friend.  I am the tailor of this outpost.  We have limited<br/>
&gt; supplies.  I often have to preserve my tailoring supplies to [mend very<br/>
&gt; large items].<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You say, &#39;How do you mend very large items?&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dionin Needlespin says &#39;I cannot use a sewing kit to mend items such as<br/>
ship<br/>
&gt; sail.  I must use my loom outside.  I have the only one available in<br/>
Kunark,<br/>
&gt; but only I am allowed to use it.  I can&#39;t have other breaking it.  I have<br/>
&gt; heard there is an old one in an ancient and ruined library.<br/>
