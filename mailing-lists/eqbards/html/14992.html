<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624134864">Well, John&#39;s post on the EQ boards concerning Lullaby now has 5+ pages of<br/>
bumps and has remained at the top of the boards.  Yet there has still been<br/>
no response from Abashi or GZ.  It is my hope that they are secretly going<br/>
to de-nerf it in tomorrow mornings patch without ever admitting that there<br/>
was a problem.  Am I a wild-eyed  optimist?<br/>
