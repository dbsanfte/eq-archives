&gt; No argument here.  Bards are great when the primary class isn&#39;t present.  We<br/>
&gt; seem to have a fantastic ability to fill in the holes of any party and at<br/>
&gt; least partially make up for any missing class. <br/>

Verant has made things so difficult at high levels that you have to have<br/>
multiple groups for almost everything, and it&#39;s not very likely that you<br/>
will be missing the primary class at all. This then makes the bard role<br/>
extremely limited, taking a lot of the fun out of playing the character.<br/>
