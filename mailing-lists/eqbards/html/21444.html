<div id="ygrps-yiv-510994593">The &quot;broken as intended&quot; message from VI on Lullaby was the proverbial<br/>
straw.  When El Gordo made the comment that it should *ALWAYS* have a base<br/>
resist (on the 2nd resist) no matter the PC/MOB level difference, then<br/>
called that balanced vs no mana usage... well, that was the point where most<br/>
folks had had enough. (not to mention the never-before-heard-of &quot;Lullaby was<br/>
never supposed to work on creatures over level 30&quot;  I&#39;ve been in EQ since<br/>
Beta, followed bard news VERY closely, and have never heard that before.<br/>
Ever.)<br/>
