<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970682262">Go camp the bedroom on the dead side of Guk.  Pull the deadly black widows<br/>
and you will be sooooo full of that damn spider silk - it won&#39;t be funny.<br/>
You can also pull vampire bats and have stacks and stacks of bat wings.  I<br/>
master loot for my party and the sheer number of these things made me turn<br/>
on fast destroy for the first time.  You need a party for this spot and got<br/>
to watch for trains. <br/>

		I have a question for you Kitasi (or anyone else), where do<br/>
you get your<br/>
		spider silks?  Do you actually have to go out and kill<br/>
innumerable giant<br/>
		spiders, or is there a place you can just buy these and cut<br/>
out all the<br/>
		running around?<br/>
<br/>
		For example...I have been working on baking lately and I had<br/>
saved up about<br/>
		80 fresh fish I had caught and after trying to kill bats<br/>
(for their wings)<br/>
		on the order of obtaining about 80 batwings for &quot;fish rolls&quot;<br/>
I finally gave<br/>
		up and found a merchant selling batwings for cheap enough<br/>
that I &quot;ate&quot; the<br/>
		loss and bought a backpack full.  This is what I would like<br/>
to do with<br/>
		spider silks instead of running all over the place at level<br/>
29 killing<br/>
		spiders like some kind of wild neurotic arachnophobe.<br/>
<br/>
		Hints, suggestions?<br/>
