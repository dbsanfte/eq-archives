<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121789860">What message gets displayed when an enchanter successfully casts tashan?<br/>
I&#39;ve grouped with this enchanter on numerous occasions and I know that in<br/>
normal pulls (1 or 2) mobs, he primarily keeps stunning them over and over<br/>
again.  The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the fight<br/>
was the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was the<br/>
message enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>
<br/>
Good idea though on the tashan possibility.  I didn&#39;t think of that but its<br/>
the most likely reason my songs stuck better.  Another good reason why bards<br/>
and enchanters group well together.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hmmm an enchanter joined you ? Enchanters usually start fights with the<br/>
&gt; tashan debuff spell, that dramatically reduce opponents magic resistance.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it does explain the difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     I was in the assasin room in LGUK last night.  The ghoul knights we<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt;     fighting usually either conned blue to me or red.  We had a druid in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;     group ensnaring so I weaved Largos Binding during combat.  My CHR was<br/>
&gt; 130 at<br/>
&gt;     the time and whenever we went up against a red ghoul, they resisted<br/>
&gt; Largos<br/>
&gt;     frequently.  Later on an enchanter joined the group and buffed my CHR<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;     158.  From that point I was able to get Largos to stick on almost<br/>
&gt; every red<br/>
&gt;     ghoul we fought.  I didn&#39;t parse a log file so its all subjective, but<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;     seemed that higher CHR made this song more effective.  I was under<br/>
&gt;     impression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind<br/>
&gt; control<br/>
&gt;     related songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.  Does<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt;     know if higher CHR also effects Largos?  Its quite possible that the<br/>
&gt; random<br/>
&gt;     number generator was skewed in my favor and thats why I was having<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt;     success with the high CHR.<br/>
