<div id="ygrps-yiv-140915873">Heh heh, yeah that is definitely true.  I have been in a lot of groups with<br/>
two bards and it is great.  I&#39;d love to get in a group with Galtin and you<br/>
sometime I think we would be very deadly.  Although I think the enchanter<br/>
would have found that using his two very cheap stun spells would have even<br/>
made the slaughter more amusing.  Three bards would definitely be a hoot,<br/>
good grief think of the clarity effects at 32!  Three bards and two nukers<br/>
with an enchanter would be scary indeed.  I don&#39;t think two many servers<br/>
have as many bards as we do on E&#39;ci though.  What guild are you in Gilgurth?<br/>
I know between DoH, Armigers, and Grail Brotherhood we have almost a dozen<br/>
bards over level 25.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Bards and Enchanters<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since some people think we bards are very limited when grouped with bards, I<br/>
thought I would relate what happened to me Tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
When I logged in, two of my guildmates (bard and enchanter) were grouped<br/>
together with a warrior and another bard.  I was invited to join them.  So<br/>
our group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us bards were around<br/>
level 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs for all of us<br/>
to twist 3 songs each.<br/>
<br/>
The enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than that, he was just<br/>
medding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  He commented<br/>
on that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>
the ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was the enchanter.<br/>
Just thought it was funny.<br/>
