<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-897991236">I didn&#39;t really do any testing last night, but after one or two uses last<br/>
night, I came to the conclusion that our snare song has been secretly<br/>
nerfed.  Before, using this song on a monster at half life or less would<br/>
effectively freeze it in its tracks.  Last night, casting it on mostly dead<br/>
mobs still allowed the mobs to move as a regular snare would.<br/>
Anyone else noticed this, or is it just me?<br/>
