<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769137275">It&#39;s true Sylly.  I&#39;ve had a run of bad luck deaths the last few nights at<br/>
41 and MAN it hurts to see that exp drop.  It&#39;s like no other.  I&#39;ve been so<br/>
discouraged by it I&#39;ve been playing my alternate.  I&#39;ve got to buck up and<br/>
push through though.  Sigh...<br/>

&gt; So, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that<br/>
&gt; each time you<br/>
&gt; are killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>
&gt; that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>
&gt; die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46?  I don&#39;t remember 31 nor 36 to be<br/>
&gt; particularily bard - well, 31 was cuz I wanted 32 so badly.<br/>
