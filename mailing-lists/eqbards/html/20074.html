<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And on Lament, using it at all.  It worked nicely<br/>
&gt; when I first got it<br/>
&gt; and I loved it for a long time but haven&#39;t used it<br/>
&gt; since the early<br/>
&gt; twenties.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience has been opposite.  I couln&#39;t use it for<br/>
squat at 8th lvl, but at 29, I pull with ease.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t used it on more than 2 mobs at a time<br/>
successfully though...<br/>
<br/>
Like many of our songs, lament gets better with age.  Here is a prime example of<br/>
Lament&#39;s usefulness.  I know of several high level bards (45+) on E&#39;ci who have<br/>
successfully used Lament to break a completely spawned Lord room in LGuk.  In<br/>
other words, they Lament the boks and pull the Lord by himself.  Risky? Sure.<br/>
But when it works its amazing.  This is probably the extreme example of the<br/>
usefulness of this song, at least in the pre-Kunark zones. <br/>
