grant you your last name.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, not ALL GMs can do this. I was 22nd level before the GM finally<br/>
caught up to me and gave it to me. It was kinda neat, tho. The GM was an<br/>
ogre, he popped in, of course all decked out in this cool armor, and started<br/>
/cheer - ing me. Gave me my last name, /shout - ed &quot;Congratulations&quot; a few<br/>
times. Even though it was a small gesture, having another HUMAN ackowledge<br/>
my accomplishment REALLY made me feel pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I am petty.<br/>
