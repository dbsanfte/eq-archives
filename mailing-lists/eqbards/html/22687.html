 I had heard the access to the new continent would be through Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
Yesterday, some guildmates mentioned there being a new dock in North Ro. We<br/>
speculated this could be the evil races dock to the new land, much like the<br/>
South Ro dock. I haven&#39;t been to North Ro myself to confirm.<br/>
<br/>
 I bought the 49th song in Erudin and used it this weekend. We were in Hate<br/>
and CoM with another guild so no definitive results. We couldn&#39;t tell if we<br/>
healed less. The song does have some taunt factor, I noticed some mobs would<br/>
whack me at least once when it cycled, but not every time. The Concert Hall<br/>
has a list of Velious songs, it included the new 49th song proir to it&#39;s<br/>
introduction so probably have to take that list as a possibles list for now.<br/>
