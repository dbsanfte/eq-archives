 </span></blockquote>What were you doing before?  Unrest has a lot of pathing<br/>
problems.  What happened to you sounds like you let a mob go<br/>
back through the house to chase you, or a train passed by as<br/>
you were fighting something or playing a buffing/healing song.<br/>
In the former case, the mob can run past other mobs and<br/>
activate them or add you to their hate list.  You kill your<br/>
original pull, but the other monsters end up being trained by<br/>
someone else.  In the latter case because bards seem to<br/>
attract more attention from passing mobs that are fighting<br/>
others, you can easily get on the hate list of a passing<br/>
train, which does not seem to be a problem for other classes.<br/>
<br/>
The train gets pulled to the zone and people try to take it.<br/>
Sometimes they manage, other times they all have to zone.<br/>
When they zone, they&#39;re removed from the hate list, and you&#39;re<br/>
the only one left so they all make a beeline for you (well, in<br/>
Unrest they make a lot of U-turns too).<br/>
<br/>
If I see a train about to pass by, I try to stop any songs I&#39;m<br/>
singing.  That seems to help stop anything from the train<br/>
peeling off to join our fight.  It really is ridiculous<br/>
though.  The bartender once dropped off someone who attacked<br/>
him and was pulling him, and chased me out.  The guy gave me<br/>
an earful for &quot;stealing&quot; his pull.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, another possible explanation.  There are some idiots who<br/>
when they get a train, instead of zoning or gracefully letting<br/>
themselves be killed, they drag it through all the other<br/>
players in the hopes the train will get off them and on the<br/>
others.  Since bards tend to be mob magnets, they usually end<br/>
up getting dumped on us.<br/>
