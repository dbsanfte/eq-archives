<div id="ygrps-yiv-700064149"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>
&gt; the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>
&gt; tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  With your knowledge of Lullaby now, would you even consider firing<br/>
  up that song in LGuk?  Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>
  30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>
&gt; up screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>
&gt; evac.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That reminds me, always keep screech mem&#39;d ;-)<br/>

  [connecting to shadowmen thread] This is how a bard can outrun<br/>
  shadowmen.  Selo&#39;s + Screech.  The shadowmen move so fast in the<br/>
  opposite direction that they are out of agro radius within about<br/>
  2 seconds and give up the chase.  So if someone asks you if you<br/>
  can outrun shadowmen, you can if you are creative.  Just twist<br/>
  Selos and Screech and take off.<br/>
