<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062957226">It&#39;s not just Bard hate(tm) -- its whacko Cents.<br/>
<br/>
In past 2 weeks - I been attacked 3 time by Cents - and I was doing nothing<br/>
but Selos - one time nothing at all!  (ok I was chatting but shoulda been<br/>
playing something - cuz a bard should always be singing something Bard Union<br/>
rule 101.)  <br/>
<br/>
Normally, I&#39;d climb aboard the Black Flying Carpet and go with Bard hate<br/>
theory but I saw several others who are not bards have this same thing<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
One guy was a ranger in his 20&#39;s - and he got bushwhacked a cent.  I was<br/>
helping a guy loc his corpse and we found it northwest but still insight of<br/>
the SK bridge.  While he is looting, there is this &quot;death&quot; noise (sound<br/>
effect) and this body (the ranger) falls to the ground right next to me!<br/>
Like when a monk does feign death.  I jumped a couple feet outta my chair!!!<br/>
There was nobody any where near and alla sudden WHAMMO death noise.<br/>
<br/>
So I give the guy a tell with his loc and ask what happened.  He says he was<br/>
by the Lake Rathe zone and got ambushed by a Cent.  Course now he don&#39;t<br/>
believe me when I tell him his corpse is insight of the stone bridge.  I<br/>
keep telling him but he wants to keep looking.  Fine, I say spend a couple<br/>
hours looking down there - but I tell ya I see it right here.  Eventually he<br/>
does come to where I say and get his stuffs.  <br/>
<br/>
Weird - no?  First an unprovoked Cent attack then a fall thru the world to a<br/>
safe spot death.  <br/>

		Heh, I had an extreme case of bard hate yesterday when<br/>
logged<br/>
		on for just a few minutes. I was down at the aviak tree,<br/>
just logging<br/>
		on for a few minutes. Well, saw this magician battling a<br/>
centaur<br/>
		something, blue to me at 28th. Had my Selo up.. I am 100%<br/>
certain<br/>
		I did NOTHING to attack the centaur.</div>
