Actually the reason for the deaths had nothing to do with aria. It was part of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over casting that broke bards.  All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one that got people killed.  No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse had to stop the song and then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of duration beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a long drop :)<br/>
The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would not proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a week or so to fix.  The lists go on.<br/>
<br/>
Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster recasting.  However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that dictates how high you can go in a specific area.<br/>

&gt; The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to do with Selos and<br/>
&gt; Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells before they ran out;<br/>
&gt; which made the levitate higher - so they could use multiple casts to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>
&gt; recasting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE (and I<br/>
&gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>
&gt; out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>
&gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing<br/>
&gt; ANY testing on the bard class.	Literally 19 seconds of testing would have<br/>
&gt; caught this bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>
&gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work<br/>
&gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc). In this case<br/>
&gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They admitted it was a bug -<br/>
&gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>
&gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>
&gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>
&gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level<br/>
&gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>
&gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>

&gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>
&gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the will plummet to<br/>
&gt; their death in many areas<br/>
