it.  A 250W (or even 300W) can be problematic for GTS&#39;s.  If you are going<br/>
to build a PC and plan on a GTS - don&#39;t skimp on the power supply.<br/>

<br/>
My power supply is rated at 200W and I ran a GTS card (Prophet II 64) on my<br/>
Asus P3V4X (Via) for about a week with no problems whatsoever.  There&#39;s been<br/>
a lot of talk about giving your system more juice with a 300W PSU, but I&#39;ve<br/>
yet to read concrete evidence that states that certain mobo and video card<br/>
combos benefit, or indeed are more stable using the higher wattage.<br/>
<br/>
I think I remember reading that the GTS was built on 0.18mu technology which<br/>
requires far less power and generates less heat than the SDR and DDR line of<br/>
GeForces.<br/>
<br/>
I came to my senses, however, and ditched the GTS in favour of a Coppermine<br/>
800.  My DDR card performs admirably enough.<br/>
<br/>
Enough OT.<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that a few people seem to have lamented the &#39;loss&#39; of John Kim<br/>
from the list.  Having never read any of the fellow&#39;s posts, I can only<br/>
presume that he was a prolific tester?<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen over the past year, Rokenn has done an outstanding job<br/>
of testing and retesting with each new patch the various effects of our<br/>
songs.  Just wanted to say that your efforts are greatly appreciated and<br/>
it&#39;s people like you that make this list what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Time consuming and job threatening! ;)  (j/k)<br/>
