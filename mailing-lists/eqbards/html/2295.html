&gt; Just wanted to say one thing on this that may help..as it has helped me in<br/>
&gt; the past to get a few items..if you are camping a spot for a peticular<br/>
item<br/>
&gt; and taking turns etc... then along comes mr.nuker to steal that rare..here<br/>
&gt; is what i do..when it spawns sing the charm song right away...most of the<br/>
&gt; time mr.kill stealer nuker will dump most to all his mana so fast trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; steal the kill he wont notice that his spells arent doing any damage..or<br/>
&gt; you can run off to a different spot having the rare follow you since its<br/>
&gt; charmed...this tactic has helped me and my group many a time and<br/>
frustrated<br/>
&gt; the hell out of would be stealers..usually resulting in alot of WTF?????<br/>
&gt; from the nuker...<br/>
