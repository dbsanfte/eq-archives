Long answer:  At higher levels, not only does the number of<br/>
kills you have to make to level increase, the disparity<br/>
between player ability and mob ability increases.  You can<br/>
probably handle green mobs without any problem right now.  At<br/>
higher levels, you will have to start running from them (or<br/>
charm/fear/chaining them).  It&#39;s harder, but it&#39;s different,<br/>
and so remains fun if your primary goal is not leveling.<br/>

Not only will you need to camp to get the nice items, you&#39;ll<br/>
find it more and more dangerous to sweep through dungeons<br/>
because mob aggro radii work regardless of LOS.  So you&#39;ll<br/>
probably resort to camping a location if not a mob, and<br/>
pulling to get stuff to kill.  I find it boring too, but part<br/>
of the fun for me is helping others get the stuff they want;<br/>
so if they want to do this, I don&#39;t really mind helping them.<br/>
<br/>
You can play as usual in the outdoor zones (especially<br/>
charming giants in Rathe), but then the campers tend to<br/>
complain as you swing by every now and then with giants in tow<br/>
(which admittedly is dangerous for them).<br/>
<br/>
These are two major problems I see with the game.  Too many<br/>
players, and (paradoxically) too many mobs given the amount of<br/>
space they&#39;re packed in (this was done to support the too many<br/>
players).  As a result, any deviation from camping results in<br/>
a high probability of starting a train and/or pissing off<br/>
other players.<br/>
