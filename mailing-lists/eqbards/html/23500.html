<div id="ygrps-yiv-117954422">Well, this is interesting because its an issue that almost tore our guild<br/>
apart - in fact it incapacitated us for a few weeks.  Some people had<br/>
emotional attachments to certain races, as one guildmate said, &quot;EQ is about<br/>
killing giants and dragons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The hunt leader wanted one thing (emulate FoH) and the majority of the guild<br/>
wanted another.  In the end he convinced us that faction was fixable and we<br/>
are off on a Dain killing frenzy (well, ok we haven&#39;t actually offed him yet<br/>
- was at 2% last night =/).  <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly though, I have to agree that while its fun owning new big<br/>
Velious baddies, the risk/reward is WAY off, the mobs hit too hard and seem<br/>
to just require throwing more people at a challenge than actually using<br/>
tactics and strategy.   The drops are good but really, out of an 80 person<br/>
guild, how many are actually going to GET them?  <br/>

&gt; faction hits<br/>
&gt; in PoG when pulling)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a related note since we were talking about risk/reward in Velious:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the entire Velious faction/loot setup is all out of <br/>
&gt; balance.  Seems<br/>
&gt; to me that allying with the giants is far and away the best <br/>
&gt; choice.  The<br/>
&gt; giants give the most quests (not counting class armor quests <br/>
&gt; which all three<br/>
&gt; factions have) and you have more places to hunt since you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; worry about screwing up Coldain/dragon faction.  The Coldain <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t appear to<br/>
&gt; give any decent quests other than the Garadain series and the <br/>
&gt; Phenocryst<br/>
&gt; Focus series (BTW I really like how those quest series are <br/>
&gt; set up. Wish<br/>
&gt; there were a lot more like them in the game).  If you want to maintain<br/>
&gt; dragon faction, your limited in the places you can go beyond <br/>
&gt; Kael Drakkal.<br/>
&gt; Dragons appear to be the worst faction to ally with.  Seems <br/>
&gt; like all the<br/>
&gt; best items/hardest zones in Velious will ruin dragon faction. <br/>
&gt;  So if you<br/>
&gt; ally with them, you are really limiting your options on <br/>
&gt; places you can hunt.<br/>
&gt; Not really certain how good the quests are that you can get from the<br/>
&gt; dragons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would like to hear from those of you who have explored a lot <br/>
&gt; of Velious to<br/>
&gt; see what you think. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I dont understand is: why is our loot dropping there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but <br/>
&gt; have you tried to<br/>
&gt; get them? PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the <br/>
&gt; items (needed<br/>
&gt; for questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems <br/>
&gt; are still not<br/>
&gt; found yet.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am <br/>
&gt; guessing that they<br/>
&gt; thought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the <br/>
&gt; &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>
&gt; get the similar items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They continue to fail to understand what motivates the <br/>
&gt; players.  On top of<br/>
&gt; that, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support <br/>
&gt; the &quot;content&quot;<br/>
&gt; (role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some <br/>
&gt; ways, it is<br/>
&gt; interesting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it <br/>
&gt; is a joke for<br/>
&gt; them to ignore the fact that the majority of players will <br/>
&gt; follow the course<br/>
&gt; of least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in <br/>
&gt; PoG is to NOT<br/>
&gt; HUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not <br/>
&gt; be, and shame<br/>
&gt; on you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; <br/>
&gt; creations.  What are<br/>
&gt; you Teir&#39;dal or something? haha<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My monk on the other hand is only 2 levels a way from smackin around<br/>
&gt; Tunare&#39;s creations, hehe. Must get a silver moon bracer.<br/>
