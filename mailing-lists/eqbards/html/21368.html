<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293831323">Gotta agree with you there Shada.  One of the worst parts to me is that even with all of the incredible information and arguements brought forth on the EQ boards, they still went ahead with their &quot;broken as intended&quot; decision (not to mention NOT answering any of the well-written data posts)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;i don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the issue for<br/>
&gt;most.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s the way bards are<br/>
&gt;being treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>
&gt;expected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of verant decisions<br/>
&gt;(nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make decisions about<br/>
&gt;bards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>
