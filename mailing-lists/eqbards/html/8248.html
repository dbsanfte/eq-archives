&gt; 640 items ( the correct product of 8x8x10) per account, double that with<br/>
&gt; bank and inventory plus wearables, would be devastating in terms of storage<br/>
&gt; space even if every item was a simple 2 byte ID code and a 1 byte quantity<br/>
&gt; and a 1 bit flag for bank/inventory and another byte (at least) for<br/>
&gt; container location.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I decided to do a back of the envelope calculation on this and came up<br/>
with some interesting info. Here&#39;s the numbers<br/>
<br/>
640 items in bank max<br/>
640 items in char inv max<br/>
21  items on character<br/>
<br/>
1301 total item slots<br/>
<br/>
Now some ballpark guesses.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s give them 8 bytes to save each item descriptor and flags. I think<br/>
that&#39;s overly generous but I think the results will still be pretty<br/>
amazing.<br/>
<br/>
1301 * 8<br/>
10408<br/>
<br/>
now we have 8 characters possible per user<br/>
10408 * 8<br/>
83264<br/>
<br/>
now we have a guesstimated 130,000 users<br/>
83264 * 130000<br/>
10824320000<br/>
<br/>
So basically we are talking about 10 gig of data. Even if we doubled,<br/>
tripled, or quadrupled the amount of storage for the character items the<br/>
storage required to back it up wouldn&#39;t even fill the hard drive of the<br/>
average pc used to play Everquest. And remember, this is for every user<br/>
of EQ at 8 accounts per user, all full, and all assuming 8 slot storage<br/>
filling both bank account and inventory. If you divide this by 24, the<br/>
number of current servers, you get<br/>
10824320000 / 24<br/>
451013333<br/>
<br/>
450 meg<br/>
<br/>
Now granted, this would require that they had written a custom program<br/>
to extract just the character info records from the database, but still<br/>
the actual amount of storage here is pretty minimal.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t think item growth on characters is a significant issue in<br/>
terms of storage capacity here.<br/>
