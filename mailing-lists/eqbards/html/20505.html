<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222902505">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I dont know.  Since the chain nerf, I have not tried using it.  My<br/>
old crew with the SK who used to insist on doing the Darknessing has not<br/>
been together in quite sometime.   Currently, I group with a cleric and we<br/>
do the root/dot/nuke thing.  The cleric roots and refeshes root often while<br/>
I sing DoT&#39;s with my Selos drum.  When they (spectres in TT) get low, the<br/>
cleric will stun, banish undead, stun to prevent them from gating.  Although<br/>
the ones we have been camping, dont gate all that far.  Funny thing is, if<br/>
they are rooted and gate, they are still rooted when they re-appear at their<br/>
bind points - heh.  So, I just keep Dot&#39;ing them.<br/>
<br/>
