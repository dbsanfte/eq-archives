<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629035926">I may be in the minority here, but I could care less what we look like when<br/>
we are running and singing at the same time.  I&#39;m in 1st person view 99% of<br/>
the time so I don&#39;t even see the animation.  Only time I switch to 3d person<br/>
is if I&#39;m in an outside zone fighting and I want to make sure something<br/>
doesn&#39;t sneak up on me.  I&#39;m not running in this situation so it still isn&#39;t<br/>
a problem with me.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that the programming time could have been better spent fixing the<br/>
drum animation.  However the change has been made.  A lot of you don&#39;t like<br/>
the new animation but it doesn&#39;t affect gameplay whatsoever.  We&#39;ve started<br/>
to see some positive changes to the bard class recently.  I think one of the<br/>
big reasons why Verant has started listening to us is because as a class we<br/>
don&#39;t rant and whine as much as the other classes.  If we raise a big stink<br/>
about the bard surfing animation then IMO it would hurt us in the eyes of<br/>
Verant.  Lets focus on gameplay issues that affect bards and try to get<br/>
those fixed before we worry about bard surfing.<br/>

&gt; still can&#39;t get over the arrogance inherent in taking time to &#39;fix&#39;<br/>
&gt; something nearly all bards liked, when they can&#39;t be bothered to fix the<br/>
&gt; playing part of the percussion animation that we have been complaining<br/>
&gt; about since day 1.<br/>
