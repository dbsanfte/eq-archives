<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-853468343">Well actually i think im lucky.  I opened up my pc.  My internal case fan<br/>
was unplugged and 2 out of my 3 cpu fans were dead (ack!).  Turns out the 2<br/>
fans that have a common power plug on the mother board seem to have a faulty<br/>
plug.  I swapped it so that 2 of the 3 fans are on the other reliable power<br/>
plug and that the third fan is on the faulty one (it goes on and off).<br/>
Since i&#39;ve fixed all my fans the pc has yet to hang, and i&#39;ve done a couple<br/>
of 4-5 hours sprints of gaming and everything is ok woot.  No upgrading just<br/>
yet...<br/>

Well that is also true of any of the OS&#39;s based on the 9X Kernel (hehe well<br/>
any Microsoft OS).  I&#39;m not a *nix geek (but I play one on TV &lt;g&gt;) but I<br/>
can&#39;t help being critical.<br/>

My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>
inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>
platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>
comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some<br/>
responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>
