<div id="ygrps-yiv-228591812">I picked up a pair of gold star ruby rings from a DE who I roleplayed with<br/>
for a bit (we got into an argument over pulls in Unrest) around level 19.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know much about what was available at the time, and now consider<br/>
myself extremely lucky.<br/>
<br/>
For earrings, I have one Opalline (5cha) and one gold amber (3str).<br/>
Looking through available options, I likely will find myself another<br/>
Opalline to get rid of the now-useless extra strength (good when I was in<br/>
my bronze phase).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently wearing my Guise of the Deceiver, as it offers 13cha and<br/>
7magic resistance.  The 9/9 is tempting, but it&#39;d cause a hassle whenever<br/>
night fell.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, missed notes have been aggrivating me to no end.  My current wish<br/>
is to pick up a cloak of shadows, but I don&#39;t see that happening anytime<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
For necklace, I&#39;ve got the 5dex one at the moment (cat&#39;s eye gold, I<br/>
believe).  My friend hasn&#39;t gotten to the point where she&#39;s able to make<br/>
me a BP choker without blinking at the cost (I helped fund her through the<br/>
early skill development, considering it a worthwhile investment ;).<br/>
