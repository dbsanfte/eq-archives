I used Pixie Strike a lot to pause battles with mammoths when<br/>
I was L28.  Most of the time it was resisted or lasted the<br/>
full duration, but there were many times when it only lasted 3<br/>
or 6 seconds (I&#39;d get another song started and the mammoth<br/>
would break free, or I&#39;d play another song and start Strike<br/>
again and the mammoth would break free before the Strike<br/>
took).<br/>
