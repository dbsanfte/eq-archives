<div id="ygrps-yiv-103036097">Nah!  With a druid we NEVER pulled more then 2 and CHARM works AWESOME in<br/>
this situation.  Who needs an enchanter!  Not for Gobs :-).  Also, if you<br/>
pull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come up<br/>
far enough so that it can see you to nuke.  When it does, have a tank engage<br/>
it, snare and fear it.  Won&#39;t get another cast off the rest of the battle.<br/>
Also, the inn is a GREAT area for fear and snare since the MOBS will tend to<br/>
walk back and forth rather then run across the zone when feared here.<br/>
<br/>
Are biggest problem was the newbies fighting DW Gob pets got pissed at us<br/>
for stealing their bread and butter.  We just made sure that when we left,<br/>
all 6 were spawning pets.  Man there were a lot of newbies crowding the lake<br/>
for them!<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I do recall (and have heard from others on the server)<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the problem of course is breaking the spawn; but I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for advice on what levels the party needs to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; and other pulling techniques (does harmony or lament work,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ideally you&#39;ll want a mid-30s or higher group with an<br/>
&gt; enchanter and someone who can cast harmony.  I only counted 6<br/>
&gt; goblins - four in each corner of the tower, two in the top.<br/>
&gt; You can Lament them (which I did for the first few pulls), but<br/>
&gt; it takes a lot of time to swim around getting the four<br/>
&gt; corners, then swimming up so I could lull the two inside the<br/>
&gt; tower.  By the time I finished this, pulled, fought, and<br/>
&gt; rested from the fight, the tower was fully spawned again and I<br/>
&gt; had to repeat the entire process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So ideally you&#39;ll want someone to cast harmony to lull<br/>
&gt; everything at once, then pull.  If you overpull (which is<br/>
&gt; pretty easy), you&#39;ll want the enchanter to mez the<br/>
&gt; extras.  This will save you enough time that the gobs won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; respawn by the time you&#39;re ready for the next pull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The biggest problem are the casters.  Not only do they like to<br/>
&gt; stand back and nuke, they like to stand back and shoot arrows<br/>
&gt; at you, so they&#39;re even less likely to run within melee range<br/>
&gt; of your group.  I think this is why most people pull to the<br/>
&gt; zone - so they aren&#39;t nuked by a caster that&#39;s still at the<br/>
&gt; water&#39;s edge out of sight.  You&#39;ll want a full-time healer if<br/>
&gt; your group is in the 30s.  If the group is in the 40s you<br/>
&gt; should be ok with just a paladin doing the healing, as you<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t take as much damage from the nukes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The helms seem to drop pretty often.  I&#39;d say about 1 in 5<br/>
&gt; goblins has one.  We got 9 last night.  3 for bards, one for a<br/>
&gt; paladin who thought it&#39;d be neat to have a black helm, and we<br/>
&gt; let 5 rot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, this being an open zone, be aware that once you break<br/>
&gt; the spawn, people who are soloing will come down to pull<br/>
&gt; goblins.  Usually the spawn is fast enough that this isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; problem.  But if someone is being a jerk about it, just sit<br/>
&gt; back for a few minutes and let the tower respawn.  That&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; remind them who&#39;s in control of the situation.<br/>
