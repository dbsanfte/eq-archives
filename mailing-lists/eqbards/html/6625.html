<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408490483">I guess they reversed the changes on all the items so no babies would scream<br/>
&quot;unfair!&quot;.  I have four examples taken from real results of the changes:<br/>
<br/>
Box of abu ja&#39;far: A weakling spellcaster with a big brain who does a lot of<br/>
trade skills logs out with a box full of ore for smithing, then logs back in<br/>
after the patch and is so encumbered he cannot move and must subsequently<br/>
drop all his ore on the ground and cut his losses.  I don&#39;t know how many<br/>
people this really affected, but I guess it would have been better for<br/>
reasons such as this (not even taking into account the 1500-2000pp others<br/>
paid for what turned out to be not much better than a tailor made backpack).<br/>
<br/>
Hero Bracer: A ranger character wearing the bracer removes it and puts it in<br/>
the trade window to show a friend the day of the patch and when he goes to<br/>
re-equip it, lo and behold, he can no longer do so.  I say oh well to this,<br/>
live with it, but it did not affect me either so I am biased in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Order of Thunder: This DID affect me, I was truly saddened to find my<br/>
medallion lost its piddily 2AC points AND its light source affect<br/>
considering that it has always been a LORE, NO TRADE, NO DROP item for the<br/>
months that I have had it.  I wondered, why? Is it THAT big of a deal?<br/>
<br/>
Russet Armor: Same scenario as the Ranger who could not re-equip his Hero<br/>
Bracer, but in this case, you remove your armor and now you have no armor,<br/>
and you can&#39;t sell or trade it because it is NO TRADE NO DROP.  I do think,<br/>
however, that if you are high enough level to have that kind of item, you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have all that much trouble replacing it with something decent,<br/>
(not from fear plane of course ;-) again (as in the box) fair warning would<br/>
have resolved this.<br/>

&gt; absolutely.  i don&#39;t understand the reversal of lustrous russett from<br/>
&gt; warrior only to all plate wearers.  it is obviously intended <br/>
&gt; to be warrior<br/>
&gt; only and i hope they change it back.  every armor from PoF is <br/>
&gt; class specific<br/>
&gt; to one class.  lustrous russett should be no different.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What does everyone think about all the changes from monday&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; patch that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; reversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist <br/>
&gt; &gt; : )], Hero Bracer<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD <br/>
&gt; &gt; BE warrior only,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but they should have made it so instantly when they <br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered the error.<br/>
