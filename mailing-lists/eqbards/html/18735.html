&gt; I&#39;m still trying to figure out where they got the idea that we would have a<br/>
&gt; use for Enduring Breath (we have the spell and are guaranteed never to be<br/>
&gt; out of the radius) and Summon drink (we are one of only 3 classes to get<br/>
&gt; forage).  It&#39;s bizarre.  Seems to me like another case of:<br/>
&gt; Question: 	&quot;We have no idea what effect to put on Bard armor&quot;<br/>
&gt; Answer: 	&quot;Hmmm, me neither, hey that fishbone earring is popular,<br/>
&gt; give them<br/>
&gt; 		Enduring Breath, and Summon Water goes well with that theme&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the endure breath effect is worth having. At least if you plan<br/>
on ever doing a kedge raid. The problem with the song is it prevents<br/>
enduring breath from being cast on people in your party, which makes<br/>
them totally reliant on the song, and no one in their right mind would<br/>
bet their life on that. Like levitate, endure breath song is one of<br/>
those songs that should have been made self only for all the real use it<br/>
gets in parties, compared to the real hassle it is.<br/>
<br/>
It still doesn&#39;t make up for the crap AC though. As usual the live team<br/>
has has no concept of balance between classes. Look at SK weapons. From<br/>
an absolute dearth of them prior to the expansion, you now can&#39;t turn<br/>
around in Kunark without tripping over a new one. Meanwhile Abashi is<br/>
still maintaining that caster items are out there somewhere, you just<br/>
have to keep looking. (somehow pretty reminiscent of the recent<br/>
statements he made on spell drops)<br/>
<br/>
As well, the druid armor is nothing to write home about. The arms have a<br/>
dot druids capable of getting them stopped using over 10 levels ago and<br/>
has 1 more AC than their planes arms. The bracer has 2 more AC and a<br/>
similarly lame spell, share wolfform. Ya, having that as a mana free<br/>
cast is ___so__ useful. I&#39;d certainly be discarding my 9 wisdom verm<br/>
bracer for that in a second. As well, they couldn&#39;t even be bothered<br/>
making the druid armor a different color. It looks almost exactly the<br/>
same green as vermiculated and ranger chain.<br/>
<br/>
I hear that the ranger breastplate in the beta for Kunark had effect:<br/>
Gate. That&#39;s going to be nice, for Rangers anyway.<br/>
