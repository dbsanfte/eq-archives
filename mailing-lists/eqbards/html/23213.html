&gt;figure out if its better to use this song or Nivs in order to reduce<br/>
&gt;downtime due to lost health.  SoS gives a 48pt runeshield against melee<br/>
&gt;attacks with lute equipped.  Nivs heals 12 pts of damage with lute equipped<br/>
&gt;plus gives a 20 pt runeshield against magic attacks.  The extra STR from<br/>
&gt;Nivs doesn&#39;t really affect downtime so I don&#39;t consider that a factor when<br/>
&gt;deciding between the two songs.  Against melee-only mobs, SoS appears to be<br/>
&gt;the best choice while Niv&#39;s is better against caster mobs.  So far I have<br/>
&gt;primarily used these songs when there is no cleric in the group and the<br/>
&gt;druid/shaman needs some help keeping everyone alive.  Would like to hear how<br/>
&gt;everyone else uses these two songs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i use song of twilight against caster mobs.  i&#39;d rather prevent them from casting than<br/>
absorb 20 points of damage, especially when they&#39;re casting stuff like ice comet on<br/>
us, heh.  plus it helps against shaman mobs who like to slow our primary damage<br/>
dealers, heh.</div>
