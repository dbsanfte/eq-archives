<div id="ygrps-yiv-836177164">It took me about 7 hours to get the fire boots from SolA.  I<br/>
used my wizard (level 42) and had a level 50 wizard helping clear<br/>
as many solusek goblins as we could.  For 5 hours there was also<br/>
another group in the king room clearing that and several<br/>
other nearby gobs, that were helping me look for boots.<br/>
<br/>
Unlucky I guess, almost all the other items were under 30 minutes,<br/>
I still need both items for the helmet.<br/>

&gt; I have seen a couple of comments on how hard Icy Greaves are to get.<br/>
&gt; This example matches my own experience, that they were easy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went to king room twice. Once there was a group there i asked about<br/>
&gt; looting icy greaves, they said they needed 4 pair (no bards in group...<br/>
&gt; go figure). That night I returned and got in a group camping king room,<br/>
&gt; they had cleared the room, next round (2nd or 3rd elite) I got greaves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you decide to go to the room invis, beware, the Goblin Wizard can see<br/>
&gt; invis.<br/>

&gt; &gt; So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>
&gt; &gt; That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>
&gt; &gt; on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>
&gt; &gt; this quest, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
