my cleric friend ran from north karana to collect the book that spawns<br/>
there. In that time I saw nothing but the usual bixies and orcs on<br/>
tracking. No undead, not even a normal ghoul. I have spoken to other<br/>
people on the server some of whom wanted to hunt the undead spawn in<br/>
Kithicor, and it seems that, on Rodcet Nife at least, Kithicor has<br/>
returned to its original pre-haloween state.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this applies to other servers or whether Rodcet<br/>
himself has intervened and removed the undead from the server that<br/>
bears him name.<br/>
