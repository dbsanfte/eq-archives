<div id="ygrps-yiv-449416799">Hail fello song brothers and sisters,<br/>
<br/>
   I was looking at the list of instruments and songs from the concert hall,<br/>
and I saw some info that concerdicted the song and instrument list from this<br/>
site.  I was wondering if any of you have tested the following songs and<br/>
instruments, and know which site is correct.<br/>
<br/>
song: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge, Lev 43, this site says damage is 311+(lev-43)*2<br/>
making MAX dame at Lev 50 only 325, and does not say anything about mana; CH<br/>
says it does 275 dam and requires 800mana?<br/>
<br/>
Instrument: Mistmore battle drums: this site says +20%; CH says +25%<br/>
<br/>
Instrument: Lute of the gypsy princes: this site says no effect; CH says +5%<br/>
<br/>
   Was just wondering if anyone can conferm which site is correct? I am only<br/>
Lev 22, with no unique instruments, so can not test them, but I am on<br/>
Bristlebane and if any of you High Lev Bards on Bristlebane can give me or help<br/>
me obtain the MM Drum and Princes Lute, I will be more then happy to both Pay<br/>
for the Item and Test them!  HEHE HAHA *LOL*<br/>
