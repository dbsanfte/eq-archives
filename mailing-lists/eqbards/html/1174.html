<div id="ygrps-yiv-148690283">It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s duration) and drops<br/>
Magic Resist 14 points, for me at 48th, if you use a drum.  Without a drum,<br/>
it does 24 damage total, and still lowers MR by 14.<br/>
<br/>
The Chant of Frost and Flame are EXACTLY the same spell, but affect the<br/>
targets Cold and Fire resists instead of Magic. The three stack, so if you<br/>
cycle them the damage adds up. Have to say, with 187 in percussion skill,<br/>
the Chant of Frost is VERY hard to sing, a constant string of missed notes.<br/>
All three chants are in Freeport and Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Chorus of Cessation is a killer.  With a lute, it does 40 damage per tick,<br/>
is an area song, and drops attack speed quite a bit.  Without a lute, it<br/>
does 14 per tick.  Consider it a mix between Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and<br/>
Chords of Dissonance, on steroids. Perfect for clearing out hall trash.  One<br/>
pulse does 120 damage. Or 2000 damage per minute, if you have four targets<br/>
(same as all the area songs, it hits four targets max).  That doesn&#39;t even<br/>
consider the damage your party doesn&#39;t take thanks to the very nice slowing<br/>
effect it has on the targets as well.  That&#39;s pretty potent.  You can find<br/>
it in Highpass.<br/>
<br/>
Elegy is a party buff, the casters will like you a bit more.  It raises INT<br/>
and WIS 13 points at 48th.  That one is in Erudin.<br/>
<br/>
Rumour has it that there&#39;s at least one more 40+ song out there to be found.<br/>
It&#39;s more potent than Cessation, and may even make a few of the nuking<br/>
classes grumble.<br/>

&gt;So, has anyone tried out any of the new songs and figured out what they do<br/>
&gt;yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I purchased the level 30 song, but haven&#39;t had the chance to investigate<br/>
&gt;yet.  The icon is a red-background Disenchant symbol, so my first guess on<br/>
&gt;that would be a targeted Disenchant to de-buff enemies (or maybe de-charm<br/>
&gt;friends?).  If it can remove charm, it could be very handy against certain<br/>
&gt;creatures.  (I just love getting beat up by my own party&#39;s Monk when<br/>
&gt;fighting the Diviner in Cazic...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, the song is in Freeport by the way.  There are new songs in Kelethin,<br/>
&gt;Freeport, and Erudin.  I haven&#39;t had the chance to check Qeynos or Highpass<br/>
&gt;yet.<br/>
