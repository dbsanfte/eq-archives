<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520680446"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The lvl 35+ undead pop up during the night hours. Verant had implemented<br/>
&gt;this for Halloween, but the response from all the players over lvl 30 was<br/>

&gt;night it is hell on Norrath. Awesome fun though =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some things, especially the dread wolves and enraged dread wolves, do NOT<br/>
always despawn at the morning. This means that often there will be several<br/>
things left in the zone that are still very aggressive and dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Kith is definitely safer during the day, but do not consider it<br/>
totally safe. Do not casually walk by a wolf before being sure what it is.<br/>
Those enraged dread wolves hit me for 97 and cast nasty necro spells and are<br/>
red to me at level 34.<br/>
<br/>
Also, walking along the very edge of the zone is safer, but there are a few<br/>
mobs who DO wander up on the side of the zone, quite far up the side wall.<br/>
All of the ones I have seen are wanderers though, so if you see a skeleton<br/>
in front of you along the side of the wall, wait a few minutes and he&#39;ll<br/>
leave.<br/>
