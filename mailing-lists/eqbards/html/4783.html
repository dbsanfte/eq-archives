<div id="ygrps-yiv-127600721"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; This also happened with the armor merchant in East<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport - he was indifferent even with Carillon<br/>
&gt; &gt; until i walked AROUND the his counter and stood in<br/>
&gt; &gt; front of him. Amiable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right, you missed the error message &quot;you cannot see your target&quot;. Once you<br/>
went over the counter the song worked normally.<br/>
<br/>
This seems like such a boring song, early discussion was that it was nerfed,<br/>
that it didn&#39;t help that much etc. But I find I KEEP it memed unless I am in<br/>
a high-demand dungeon situ (like Soulsek) where I need all my slots. Once I<br/>
&quot;got&quot; it, it very much changed my relationship to the world of Norrath, now<br/>
Halas and Highpass Hold are nnot so terribly hostile, and I worry less about<br/>
selling becuse I almost always get teh good price (not Rathe Mountains<br/>
however, haven&#39;t found a way to get above &quot;indifferent&quot; there)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a groggy morning thought,<br/>
