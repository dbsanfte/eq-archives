 </span></blockquote>This was hashed over on the monk list too (monks need the<br/>
lightweight armor the frogloks carry).  The general consensus<br/>
was that by the time you want to go to Lower Guk (A L30+<br/>
dungeon), you&#39;ll be high enough level that the frogloks in<br/>
Upper Guk will mostly leave you alone.  Also, there are two<br/>
factions of frogloks - the normal and the undead.  Killing<br/>
undead frogloks raises your faction with the normal frogloks.  <br/>
Lower Guk is full of undead frogloks, so a few trips there<br/>
should get you back on the good side of the normal frogloks.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;d say Misty Thicket and Butcherblock (minotaur<br/>
caves) are good for making money at L10.  In Innoluthe, Upper<br/>
Guk, and Paw, you will have a big problem with trains -<br/>
frogloks and gnolls start to run away while at full speed<br/>
(unlike orcs).  So they&#39;ll escape just as you&#39;re about to kill<br/>
them and come back with more mobs.  With frogloks, it&#39;s all<br/>
the water and the fact that they can swim faster than you<br/>
which lets them get away. In Paw it&#39;s all the twists and<br/>
turns.  Having someone who can root is essential for hunting<br/>
in these places.  Blackburrow is not as bad in this respect<br/>
because you can use Accelerando. But other classes can&#39;t, and<br/>
they&#39;ll start the trains for you.<br/>
