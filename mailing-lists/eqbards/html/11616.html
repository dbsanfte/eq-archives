&gt; Good grief - I&#39;d expect this type of answer (generically) from a wizard,<br/>
&gt; but not a bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is the ONLY thing you look at your profit margin? I am first and<br/>
&gt; foremost a<br/>
&gt; merchant - but jeeze, I spend a LOT of time makin things that folks NEED -<br/>
&gt; sometimes even at a personal loss.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not a merchant.   I find people in general way too inconsiderate<br/>
to find joy in selling items.  I give away stuff for free, or I sell it<br/>
to merchants.<br/>
<br/>
When I kill HGs, I loot the first to sell later, the rest of the<br/>
stones I find I /ooc the location of it, tell people to come and<br/>
get it.  I am not greedy.<br/>

&gt; know is required in abundance for an armor quest - well, what can<br/>
&gt; I say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t help strangers that much.  Friends of mine receive help with no<br/>
thought of debt.  <br/>
<br/>
You say it yourself, this item is required, in abundance, and you are a<br/>
merchant.  What self-respecting merchant out there gives away free items<br/>
because they aren&#39;t of much value to them.<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever complained about people selling high level runes and words<br/>
and pages for 50-100pp if they want, I see no difference between<br/>
this and lambent stones, if you do please tell me what it is.<br/>
<br/>
My bard bought most of his stones from merchants near banks or<br/>
near HGs/SGs.<br/>
