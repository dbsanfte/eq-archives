<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766884546">I would love an invis to undead song. Or a song that combined 2 songs effects <br/>
(say song slot 1 is the first song, song slot 2 is the 2nd song, and song <br/>
slot 3 was the combiner).<br/>
Hmm, what else on my wish list....maybe an upgraded charm? say upto level 50 <br/>
now that the expansion is comin out?  <br/>
Of course bind would be cool but I just cant see that happening.<br/>
