<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226278258"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt; be?  I have both, and was planning on using them at level 17 for dual wield.<br/>
&gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>
&gt; a Dragoon Dirk.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A tentacle whip, while fast and a cheap weapon, has a horrible dmg/delay<br/>
ratio (0.16), almost as bad as a rusty weapon. The lifetap effect is<br/>
very very minor. A dragoon dirk is fast and does good dmg (0.260). For<br/>
comparison, the PGT Is 0.230, a barbed whip is 0.250 and a mino axe is<br/>
0.216. Higher is better.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d personally go with that dragoon dirk. Good damage and speed, good<br/>
stat bonuses. And fast weapons are nice.<br/>
