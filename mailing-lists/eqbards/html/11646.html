<div id="ygrps-yiv-743946895">Response to many messages with this one.<br/>
<br/>
1.	New drop is Mask of Deception. Exact same stats as the Guise (4ac 13cha<br/>
7mr NO DROP yadda yadda) Only new thing is that it must be equipped to<br/>
trigger the Illusion: Dark Elf effect.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Someone mentioned about big ogres and trolls blocking hallways and that<br/>
the Guise is perfect for taking care of this. From a utility standpoint, yes<br/>
that is true, but that is about all there is to it. There is really no sense<br/>
of why the Guise is used.<br/>
<br/>
3.	The RP sense of it all. I know I&#39;d raise my hand first when I say that I<br/>
don&#39;t really consider what race a char is when I group with them. I did when<br/>
I was level 6 but now it gets difficult to pick and choose who to group<br/>
with. If this were not the case and many people RP&#39;d racial reactions in<br/>
groups I&#39;d imagine that there would be a lot fewer dyed DE&#39;s and the ones<br/>
you&#39;d mostly see would be naturals. (Although the female DE form is rather a<br/>
pleasant sight };)<br/>
<br/>
4.	Ever think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would change<br/>
them into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>
(possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>
afoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>
the frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs as<br/>
plotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>
<br/>
5.	Personally I&#39;d prefer the thing to have the effect for as long as you<br/>
have it on (not just from an annoying &#39;damn-the<br/>
effect-wore-off-gotta-right-click-it-again&#39;). If you want to be a DE then<br/>
you&#39;d slip the Mask on and the magic of it would change your form. Mostly<br/>
similar to what happens in the movie &#39;The Mask&#39;. Unfortunately the engine<br/>
can&#39;t seem to handle the illusion effect across zones(?)<br/>
<br/>
