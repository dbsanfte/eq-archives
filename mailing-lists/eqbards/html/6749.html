<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168922742"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As soon as the Wizards start nuking, the mobs will switch from the &gt; Cleric to the Wizards.  Now the Cleric con only watch the Wizards &gt; die, as he can&#39;t attack or cast any spells (including HEAL) until &gt; the 18 seconds wear off. It really sucks watching a party member die &gt; because you are not allowed to heal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Divine aura is a buff spell that you cast, like all other spells and song effects, if you are the caster, you can click the icon and make it go away.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The best way is to use DA on a pull when the puller is taking heavy &gt; damage.  Heal a couple of times when the puller shows up, and draw &gt; all the mobs to you.  Then use DA to give everyone 18 seconds to &gt; pull them off you.  This works ok, but in many pickup groups this &gt; would get me <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Which is why the use of the spell has to be used with great care around bards.  You cast aura, and you&#39;re agression to it is moved to the bottom of the list.  If no one else has been meleeing it, the bard is almost always the next thing on the list.  There have been numerous times where it&#39;s worked out to:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Puller pulls 4 things<br/>
2)  I heal, pulling 3 of them on me<br/>
3)  I aura, 3 things turn on the bard<br/>
4)  Click off aura, heal bard<br/>
5)  Heal bard<br/>
6)  Heal bard<br/>
<br/>
  The problem I&#39;ve found that ever since the bard melee skills started capping, it becomes more and more important to treat them as a caster (meaning the tanks stop to pull creatures off of them) than as a full fledged melee class, where the group happily allows 3 things to beat on the bard while trying to kill something else.<br/>
