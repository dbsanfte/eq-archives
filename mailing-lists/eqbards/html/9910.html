<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442776467">sounds exactly right, not sure why you are having trouble.  possible your<br/>
charisma is too low for charm to last long enough to be effective, or your<br/>
level is too low for charm to stick for long.  i do understand your<br/>
frustration though, i was always afraid of learning how to charm well and<br/>
did not use until i hit 50 hehe.<br/>

&gt; - Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, <br/>
&gt; &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>
&gt; - Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; - Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>
&gt; - Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately <br/>
&gt; attack it due<br/>
&gt; to its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other <br/>
&gt; brother and<br/>
&gt; hit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>
&gt; - Click on original charmee.<br/>
&gt; - Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; - Watch ensuing battle.<br/>
&gt; - When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>
&gt; - Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>
&gt; attack&quot; status.<br/>
&gt; - Repeat until one is dead.<br/>
&gt; - Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or <br/>
&gt; chain/fear issue to<br/>
&gt; finish survivor off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc <br/>
&gt; Centurians in<br/>
&gt; East Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something <br/>
&gt; or I&#39;m just not<br/>
&gt; coordinated to pull it off.<br/>
