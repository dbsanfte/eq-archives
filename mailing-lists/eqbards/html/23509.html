<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305180643">I know how you feel.  We haven&#39;t really had any hard and fast rules up to<br/>
this point, haven&#39;t needed them since 90% of us know one another in RL as<br/>
well.  I have noticed though that some people once they get something tend<br/>
to become ever more greedy than before.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is, while I am an officer in the guild, so is the offending<br/>
party.  Maybe I just need a new guild with more structure or maybe all<br/>
guilds suffer this to some degree.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking uber loot<br/>
here.  The weapon in one instance was about the same as the one he was<br/>
using, though cooler looking perhaps.  It would have been a considerable<br/>
upgrade for one of the members who was building up a second character,<br/>
mostly due to guild needs however.  Had he offered to sell it within guild<br/>
one of the parties would surely have bought it, although probably being a<br/>
bit irritated<br/>
in the process considering the only reason they didn&#39;t get it the first time<br/>
was because he said he wanted to use it.<br/>

I know how I would handle it in my guild: this person would no longer be a<br/>
member.<br/>
<br/>
We have a 3 strike policy, meaning that you get two warnings and when the<br/>
third<br/>
problem is confirmed, you&#39;re out.  This applies unless the transgression is<br/>
serious enough to warrant immediate action.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, if you all have a loot and/or behavior policy (which we do)<br/>
and<br/>
his actions violate that policy (this behavior clearly violates our policy)<br/>
then no warnings are necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that sounds harsh, but lying and greed are not the kinds of<br/>
behavior I<br/>
want even peripherally associated with my name.<br/>
