<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581305354">I soloed from level 1-5 in West Freeport and East Commons.<br/>
<br/>
From there on I NEVER soloed.  Personally I find EQ to be an AWFUL solo<br/>
game.  It&#39;s only the social aspect - and the interaction and strategy<br/>
between the player classes that I find interesting - ESPECIALLY for the bard<br/>
class (where our strength is that we can fill in for so many other classes).<br/>
<br/>
If I want to solo - I fire up Civ3 - it&#39;s a MUCH better single-player game.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that a lot of people will want to game for a 30-60 minute<br/>
session - and the difficulty of finding a group and getting setup precludes<br/>
that (especially if you are unguilded or in a small guild) - but again -<br/>
that&#39;s when I play some Civ3 (or whatever game it was in the past)...<br/>

&gt; So, what, I join the list and you all get quiet?  I&#39;m only 11, my<br/>
&gt; reputation cannot have preceded me as yet.  I&#39;ve been soloing in NK<br/>
&gt; since 9, my first bard.  Any words of wisdom on where to go next?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;d be really great would be if a couple of real pros would list<br/>
where they soloed for each level(s) on their way up, like &quot;from 12-16<br/>
I killed monsters in zone X through melee, then up to 20 I kited Pink<br/>
Volvo Demons who conned yellow, then...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually started my own list just to find out where to solo<br/>
at &quot;higher&quot; levels (people try to say you should give it up after<br/>
about 12th, but I prefer solo)...Soloing Everquest,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to post what I know about soloing, and data I&#39;m<br/>
accumulating, like lists of soloable MObs (monsters) for each level,<br/>
tricks for soloing better (how to automatically raise your sense<br/>
direction, forage, mend, and other skills as fast as possible, no<br/>
button-clicking required), and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that both people with questions and people with advice<br/>
will join the list and post, and we can get a really good<br/>
infosite/faq going after a while.<br/>
