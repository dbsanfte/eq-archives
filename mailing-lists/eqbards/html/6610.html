<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469251636">Let me give an analogy to try to better explain what I was saying.  <br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;fear&quot; that exists in the Plane of Fear is what the players, not<br/>
their characters, have in their own mind.  This &quot;fear&quot;, due to the current<br/>
way the Plane of Fear works, is that 1) they will automatically die and lose<br/>
hard earned experience and 2) most likely not be able to recover their<br/>
corpse. Thats some bad mojo and rightfully so.  I agree something needs to<br/>
be done about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I will use myself as an example.  I&#39;m a 22d level bard.  Suppose I was<br/>
considering camping the basement in Unrest or the castle in Mistmoore.  I<br/>
use these places as examples because I would almost certainly die if I went<br/>
to these locations.  My reservation about going to these places is for all<br/>
practical purposes the same &quot;fear&quot; that the 46+ level players are having.<br/>
The only difference is that I have a better chance of recovering my corpse.<br/>
If my corpse is deep in the basement, I couldn&#39;t do it myself but I could<br/>
get the assistance of someone much higher level than me to protect me while<br/>
I was recovering my corpse.  46+ characters don&#39;t have the luxury of someone<br/>
higher helping them retrieve their corpse so, IMO, thats the only difference<br/>
between me camping the basement in Unrest versus them camping the Plane of<br/>
Fear.  You could argue that this luxury makes a world of difference and<br/>
makes the entire analogy invalid.  I could be totally offbase here so take<br/>
it with a grain of salt.  It does make for an interesting, allbeit<br/>
off-topic, discussion:-)<br/>
<br/>
IMO, the Plane of Fear, as well as all others, should have something magical<br/>
about them that takes into account that the Norrathian laws of physics and<br/>
magic don&#39;t apply in the planes.  Thats pretty much how it works in most<br/>
fantasy games I&#39;m aware of.  Verant even stated when the Fear plane opened<br/>
up that magic worked different in there.  In order to do that, they need to<br/>
add the magical fear, hate, etc. element (or something along the same line)<br/>
I discussed in my original post.  Obviously if they were to do that, they<br/>
would have to do some major tweaking of how the planes work.  Offensive<br/>
capabilities of the mobs would need to be reduced to the point where, when<br/>
combined with the ideas I proposed, a players chance of survival is<br/>
near/equal that of what it was before the Plane of Fear was tweaked to the<br/>
point of where it is now.  Bottom line is that characters should, with a lot<br/>
skill, good planning, and a little luck, have the chance to go to the Planes<br/>
(or anywhere for that matter) and afterwards sit around the campfire and<br/>
celebrate their accomplishment.  Verant will get it fixed eventually (we all<br/>
hope).   <br/>
<br/>
My brain hurts after this one.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Just an idea, but perhaps Verant could reduce the toughness of the<br/>
&gt; combats<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the Planes so people have a better chance of survival but also make<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Planes somehow reflect what they are.  For example, in Fear, the players<br/>
&gt; &gt;magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become scared.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>
&gt; &gt;they start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a<br/>
&gt; player<br/>
&gt; &gt;can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt;attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are hit<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt;constant heat that affects health and/or stamina.  In Air, constant gales<br/>
&gt; &gt;that cause damage.  I came up with these on the fly so I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
&gt; &gt;other things that could be done similar to these.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another<br/>
&gt; year<br/>
&gt; &gt;or so.  By that time, who knows how the game will work.<br/>
