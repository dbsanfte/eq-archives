<div id="ygrps-yiv-443866074">My barbarian shaman carries a Mandolin and a Horn everywhere, both are<br/>
All/All.  I used to try to convince people I really was a bard.  I did have<br/>
a few people ask me where I got my Barbarian Illusion mask though.<br/>
<br/>
Even funnier I was standing in FV the other day with my halfling druid.  I<br/>
had a Mandolin out at the time to show another bard that anyone could equip<br/>
it.  I then had two other people, one another bard, giving me the what for<br/>
because they thought it was really sick I was using the Halfling Skin Mask<br/>
from Nektulous Forest.  Pretty funny.<br/>

<br/>
Is it equipable by other classes?  If so, have a barbarian friend equip it<br/>
and convince people there&#39;s a new mask out there.  ;^)<br/>
