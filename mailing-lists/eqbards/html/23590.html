<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041989753">Hehe I generally abhor soloing as well but recent key events convinced me to<br/>
give it a try.  First, I won a Selos Drum off Naggy.  Second, I was 49th<br/>
level and wanted to ding 50 ASAP.  Third, the changes to the EXP system.  So<br/>
I went do Dreadlands and tried chant kiting for the first time.  Getting<br/>
from 49 to 50 was the easiest and fastest I have ever made a level (aside<br/>
from newbie levels).  I didn&#39;t actually time it, but I would guess it only<br/>
took me five hours to ding 50.  The only downtime I had was when I had to<br/>
stop pulling and get another SOW buff.  What little damage I took from a mob<br/>
was healed back while I was looking for another mob to pull.  <br/>
<br/>
Only problem with chant kiting I have is that it is boring as hell and not<br/>
really a challenge.  As soon as I got 50, I headed back into Karnors.  Don&#39;t<br/>
intend to ever do it again unless I can&#39;t find a group.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve  rarely solo&#39;d since level 5 or 6, apart from the occasional experiment<br/>
on a low blue or green, I&#39;m just not all that good at soloing and don&#39;t<br/>
really care for the tactics bards need to employ to be successful at it.<br/>
