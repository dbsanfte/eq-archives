<div id="ygrps-yiv-539791179">Well - they do not simply &quot;poof&quot; at 7am.  I need to look again but I have<br/>
seen that some mobs linger thru the day.  Even going to the ranger place at<br/>
10am - I see EnragedDreadWolf (bad wolfie) patrol near the path and some bad<br/>
skellie is pathed near there as well - you have to be heads up and avoid em.<br/>
But essentially, players try  something and if they are not sucessful - give<br/>
up (like me and kiting or me and charming - but hey I am getting better.)<br/>
<br/>
I had great xp time in Kith and if I could get 2 tanks, cleric, caster,<br/>
druid or sha - we could sit at the WC zone and have great time - good xp for<br/>
mid 30&#39;s.  At Rivervale, there are so many mobs - it really takes 2 groups<br/>
to hold it thru a night&#39;s attack. <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are spots that these mid to upper levels avoid because of the<br/>
danger: Sea Fury Clops in OOT,  Deep Water Goblins in Lake Rathe.  Like Kith<br/>
too hard - esp for those who &#39;grew up&#39; in HighKeep where all you do is beat<br/>
mobs senseless then wait for the next spawn.  Where is there any tactics<br/>
required?  <br/>

		  Less bang for the buck.  A L40 enraged black wolf can<br/>
eliminate an<br/>
		  entire party of L35s.  For a group of L45s, the wolf is<br/>
still a very<br/>
		  tough fight.  Too tough for the exp given.  In the time it<br/>
takes to<br/>
		  find + kill those undead, you could have killed 2 or 3<br/>
sonic bats<br/>
		  in SolB.  When 7am clicks, poof undead go ahead and you<br/>
are stuck<br/>
		  waiting until nightfall.  It&#39;s not worth the time spent.<br/>
