<div id="ygrps-yiv-142888555">Last night was the first time I got to play my bard for an extended period<br/>
of time since the latest patch.  My group consisted of me (35 bard), 33<br/>
ranger, two 35 druids, and a 37 enchanter.  We camped in the bartender room<br/>
in Sol A trying to get a armor component for the ranger.  Everything we<br/>
fought conned either blue or green to me.  During combats, I weaved Chant of<br/>
Battle, Largos, and Psalm of Cooling.  I switched to Elemental and Pixie<br/>
Strike if we faced a wizzie or shaman.  Over the course of 4 hours in that<br/>
room, I never lost more than a bub of health.  It was very difficult for me<br/>
to even get something to attack me.  Standard taunt factors from the other<br/>
players that came into play were 1) ranger did more melee damage than me, 2)<br/>
one druid did more damage with lightning spells, 3) one druid was full time<br/>
healer, 4) enchanter was doing crowd control.  In the past, even with the<br/>
taunt factors of the other players considered, weaving the three songs I was<br/>
using was usually enough to get all the mobs focused on killing me.  For<br/>
last night, most likely explanation would be either 1) bard hate was<br/>
actually reduced or 2) enchanter crowd control overrode bard hate.   I&#39;m<br/>
inclined to believe it was the enchanter that caused the mobs to ignore me.<br/>
Could have been a completely different story if no enchanter is around and I<br/>
have crowd control duties. <br/>

&gt; More evidence for reduced bard hate.  I joined Rokenn&#39;s guild<br/>
&gt; for a Vox attempt last night (4 failures).  The last one,<br/>
&gt; somehow I lived.  I played resists the entire battle.  When<br/>
&gt; all three melee people and the cleric in my group died, I was<br/>
&gt; at a bubble and a half so I meleed Vox a bit, healed the<br/>
&gt; (still alive) enchanter, meleed the priest of Nagafen and some<br/>
&gt; ice giants a bit.  I was expecting to get summoned at any<br/>
&gt; moment, but I ran around doing all this for about 3 minutes<br/>
&gt; with nothing happening.  I didn&#39;t know what to do because it&#39;d<br/>
&gt; never occurred to me that I might live.  Eventually I zoned.  <br/>
&gt; I think I was the only melee person to survive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, the first try, I played my resist song for a couple<br/>
&gt; rounds, Vox summoned me, and clawed me to death right off the<br/>
&gt; bat.  :)<br/>
