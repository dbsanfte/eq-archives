<div id="ygrps-yiv-398727934">Well last night me and my friends were killing gnomes for about 3<br/>
hours, then all of a sudden, a kill stealer we&#39;d met in highkeep (which we<br/>
reported and he got a warning for it) quite a few levels ago shows up and<br/>
decides that he was going to take the gnome we just snared and nuked 2<br/>
times. So i quickly run over to my druid that is pulling, charm the gnome<br/>
over and over.... Oh dear, mr kill stealer which just blew all his mana<br/>
seems pissed and is threatening to call a gm on us. By all means mr kill<br/>
stealer, call a gm to report us for stealing our gnome back.  Funny thing is<br/>
that this guy allready got a warning in the past cause of the same situation<br/>
in highkeep once and was talking to the guide for over an hour when that<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
	He quickly left the zone after all this happened. Seems that no one<br/>
wants to mess with a bard hehe.  My friends love me now that im 32, with<br/>
charm im the ultimate tool against want to be stealers, and i have mana<br/>
regen now, life was sweet last night. <br/>

sometimes</div>
