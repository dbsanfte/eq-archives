<div id="ygrps-yiv-717276834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, it does.  I use the mino horn exclusively for all the wind songs I<br/>
&gt; have, because I hate that silly marching animation you get with the flute.<br/>
&gt; My wind skill is maxed for my level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Marching&quot; I like that, I will use it. *laughs* However, I doubt anyone in<br/>
MY group is going to buy a descriptive word of the animation that isn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;prancing&quot; or &quot;frolicking like a little wood elf&quot; *sigh* which, BEING a<br/>
little wood elf, is a hard one to dispute. at least there is inviso. How<br/>
humiliating for a rough and tumble, macho battle bard like Tszaaz who taunts<br/>
Cinder Goblin Wizards back to the waiting tanks and endures all they can<br/>
throw at him...<br/>
