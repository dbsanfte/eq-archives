&gt; Case in point is the Exotic Drinks/Glowing Stein quest.  When the quest was<br/>

&gt; characters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in Qeynos.  This<br/>

all the killing (so you don&#39;t take a faction hit), then when<br/>
he&#39;s done you loot the fish.<br/>
<br/>
They need to make an equivalent faction hit for looting the<br/>
fish, or raise the level of the fish so you can&#39;t use a mule<br/>
for it.<br/>
