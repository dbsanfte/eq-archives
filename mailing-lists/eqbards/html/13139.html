&gt;you have The Maestro&#39;s Lute under special instruments.  Kelin&#39;s Seven<br/>
&gt;Stringed Lute IS the lute off maestro.  and i think we came up with 20% as<br/>
&gt;the increase.  we had some debate about how much we heal at 50 with a normal<br/>
&gt;lute sitting.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    *(New)*    The Maestro&#39;s Lute (Found in the Plane of Fear), which<br/>
&gt; &gt; increases the effects of most stringed songs by 15%.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9<br/>
&gt; &gt; AGI.  It also seems to add about 15-20% to stringed songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Found on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maestro of Rancor in the Plane of Hate. </span></blockquote></div>
