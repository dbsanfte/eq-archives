<div id="ygrps-yiv-324241032">*****sigh* Not more complaining and whining =(.  As usual people<br/>
constantly complain left and right about how x class gets this and it&#39;s<br/>
better than what I get.  You know what??  I think we are deserving of<br/>
armour that is more powerful than those of the Rogues and Rangers.  As of<br/>
late I am finding my melee to be useless, most of my songs are good for<br/>
groups provided I have a healer watch me.  IT makes up for the bard hate<br/>
problem.  Oh well....<br/>

&gt; Yep, it&#39;s true.  Rangers and Rogues in particular are complaining up a storm about how good the<br/>
&gt; bard armour is compared to theirs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take a moment to glow in their envy before we come back down to earth. :)<br/>
