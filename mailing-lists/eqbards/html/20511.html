<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731434339">i can&#39;t believe i put this song away for so long, other than the fact that i<br/>
just wasn&#39;t needed for pulling.  but even now at 56 in sebilis i always have<br/>
it memmed and am often pulling.  now i am almost always with a 59 warrior<br/>
though, so he can pull singles in a lot of spots without any help just due<br/>
to his level.  but it really is an icredible song for pulling at any level.<br/>
<br/>
also wanted to let you know that if you are in range to sing the song, but<br/>
not in range of getting a message, as long as you do not see a resist<br/>
message than the song has stuck successfully.  you may be too far away to<br/>
get the success message, but no matter how far you are if it is resisted it<br/>
will let you know.<br/>
