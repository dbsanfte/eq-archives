<div id="ygrps-yiv-599135472"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Do you suppose they see a few (ok 30% or so) druids using a <br/>
&gt;technique that their class allows to make some good progress -<br/>
&gt;and they decide that they have to nerf because &quot;druids are not <br/>
&gt;_supposed_ to be that powerful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not 30%, it&#39;s not even 50%, try more like 80% of druids kite.<br/>
That is the only thing they seem to want to do, and it&#39;s fine with<br/>
me, except for one issue.  People who do this impact _everyone_.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s why... I am a bard, I have to work hard for the exp<br/>
I get.  I can barely solo greens anymore, forget about tactics<br/>
like fear/chain and charm, they will only get you killed.  You<br/>
are playing the wrong class if you want to solo.  75% of your <br/>
songs have the effect &quot;PARTY&quot; in them, learn to use them.  You <br/>
will never be a soloer, our songs are not geared for that line<br/>
of work.  Instead, you have to group.  <br/>
<br/>
Now grouping is great if you have time, stable group, etc.<br/>
Otherwise, you hover and do odd tasks and maybe a few quests,<br/>
until you can find a decent group.  While these druids are out<br/>
in full force, powerleveling past you.  So where do you come in?<br/>
How does this affect you?<br/>
<br/>
Try going to earn your first pair of rubi legs.   Try to go<br/>
acquire a bloodclaw.   Try to get your favorite item.  You can&#39;t.<br/>
Because these powerleveling jokers have long surpassed you and<br/>
are now camping the goodies, that you should be after.  Kiters<br/>
can outlevel us, and thus pickup the goodies before we can work<br/>
our way there.  This is the imbalance.  I&#39;ve watched druids get<br/>
two plus levels per day, kiting.  Now instead of a handful of<br/>
level 35 people, the whole server is flooded with level 35 druids,<br/>
necros, shamans... anyone who employes the risk-free kiting tactics.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about risk.  Our fear/chain is not reliable enough to <br/>
use to make tons of exp.  One resist could mean certain death.<br/>
If the druid runs out of mana, hell, the thing is snared, you can<br/>
outrun it no problem.  Snare is that reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Cheesy or not, druids are beginning to populate more and more<br/>
of the servers, because they are extremely easy to level with<br/>
very little risk.  Thus increasing the traffic in areas where<br/>
other players who worked very long and hard to get where they<br/>
are at are playing.<br/>
<br/>
I am _not_ for eliminating kiting...<br/>
<br/>
If they want to fix druid kiting and make it more like bard<br/>
reverse kiting (ie risky), they need only make snare less<br/>
reliable (random shorter durations).  That evens the playing<br/>
fields, introduces more risk, and everyone is happy, including<br/>
me the non-soloable, hard-working bard.<br/>
