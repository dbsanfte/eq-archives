<div id="ygrps-yiv-658952548"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve been using Lullaby a lot recently to take down multiple blues while<br/>
&gt; soloing.  From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly<br/>
&gt; to our other<br/>
&gt; songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>
&gt; fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>
&gt; chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>
&gt; songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever<br/>
&gt; costs the MOB<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this conjectured song behavior or a FRPG methodology that we&#39;re assuming<br/>
applies to EQ?  I would think that the vast majority of people that play EQ<br/>
(myself included) would expect to see some tangible result from a &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
message.  I suppose one way of checking this might be to tangle with a<br/>
high-blue caster, lullaby him and see how often he might nod and be<br/>
interrupted (tangible result) and yet still awaken in time to physically<br/>
strike you in that same round.  This would seem to demonstrate the above<br/>
theory to be true.<br/>
