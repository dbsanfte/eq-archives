<div id="ygrps-yiv-309168016">General question:<br/>
<br/>
My party is is heading to SPlitpaw tonight (might as well do it before<br/>
they change it)...  People have said to get bound in the arena off Lake<br/>
Rathtear.<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible?  Are you PVP as soon as you get into the arena?  <br/>
