The true awkwardness here comes from game and program thinking rather than<br/>
fantasy world thinking.  If you think in terms of game and program there<br/>
are beings you can&#39;t kill, PCs, and beings you can (more or less), NPCs.<br/>
But that&#39;s a game artifact that impinges deeply on the fantasy world (for<br/>
those of us not player killers).<br/>
<br/>
In live roleplaying or electronic I find it deeply disturbing to metagame<br/>
and treat other beings very differently because I know they are PCs or<br/>
NPCs.  I thus believe it is best to limit making that distinction to those<br/>
situations where you are talking about the game and not living the fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
There is no appropriate in-game term because that distinction is not<br/>
supposed to exist any more than it must.  All NPCs aren&#39;t there to be prey.<br/>
 Recognizing an NPC as such isn&#39;t supposed to be the ultimate in underlying<br/>
racism.  I believe that&#39;s the point of the faction system.  Actions have<br/>
far reaching consequences.  You can&#39;t kill with impunity.  Some dwarves are<br/>
your friends, some are not.<br/>
