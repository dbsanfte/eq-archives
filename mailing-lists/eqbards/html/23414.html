<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>
&gt;are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>
&gt;This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>
&gt;reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>
&gt;box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You should have said most &quot;good&quot; sax/clarinet players. I played clarinet a <br/>
long time ago and was just happy if the reed wasn&#39;t split or moldy. And to <br/>
think I used to have to suck on those things, ewww.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The determining factor - for flutes and early winds - the vibration is the<br/>
&gt;resistance of the air crossing a blow hole.  The hunting horns are NOT<br/>
&gt;played that way.  The shape of the horn is NOT an issue for determining how<br/>
&gt;the sound is created, only altered.<br/>

wind to make the sound, as any string player. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve assumed all &quot;wind&quot; instruments should be woodwinds (flutes, <br/>
fifes) and &quot;brass&quot; would have been the various horns found in the world as <br/>
I agree with Slyde about the way the sound is created with the instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Seems Verant is taking the word &quot;brass&quot; literally as meaning any instrument <br/>
actually made of brass. Anything else is a &quot;wind&quot;. I would have thought <br/>
that all &quot;brass&quot; should have been anything using that particular mouthpiece <br/>
while &quot;wind&quot; would have been any type of &quot;woodwind&quot; instrument (flutes, <br/>
clarinets, saxophones, etc).<br/>
<br/>
What I really want to know is when we get our battle sousaphone! Woot! Tuba <br/>
Run!<br/>
