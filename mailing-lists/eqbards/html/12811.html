<div id="ygrps-yiv-337290459">I have used this song in Erudin, where vendors wouldn&#39;t talk to &quot;a wood elf&quot;<br/>
and after I sang it at them, they did. I saw no &quot;name looks friendly&quot;<br/>
message, but I did see a change in the /con- from dubious to indifferent. It<br/>
says on the list of songs I have that it is a wind instrument song, but I<br/>
think you can use it without having to equip a wind instrument. I don&#39;t<br/>
remember whether I used my flute or not when I used it on in Erudin.<br/>
