<div id="ygrps-yiv-899145410">Playing songs during a pull is a risk in hate, the reason being the<br/>
potential for trains. If you&#39;ve got a good pull team, you don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about trains after the first patrollers and 2 houses are cleared.<br/>
What actually happens though is if a pull comes in, and you are doing<br/>
party buffs and a monster trains in late, look at it&#39;s aggro list..&#39;I<br/>
see 24 people here, I hate them all, but I see 3 people that are buffing<br/>
the rest like mad, boy this pisses me off!&#39; And those 3 would be bards<br/>
playing Verses of Victory for example. So that monster will run in and<br/>
beat each bard to death if it can. 1 monster generally isn&#39;t going to<br/>
kill you so fast that your cleric can&#39;t heal you (unless it&#39;s an<br/>
abhorrent/scareling with some nice backstabs) but more likely than not a<br/>
train in Hate will consist of 4-5 monsters, and they will kill you from<br/>
2000 hp to dead in about 2 seconds. What I&#39;d recommend for both Hate and<br/>
Fear, is to not play any party buffs until enough time has elapsed that<br/>
any train coming would have arrived (say 30 seconds after the pull comes<br/>
in).<br/>
A bard in the puller&#39;s group can be very good and bad, it depends on the<br/>
bard&#39;s skill level and experience. Pros are, the puller&#39;s team<br/>
cleric/clerics will also be better off on mana, but there are several<br/>
ways for a bard to pull a train into the group if they don&#39;t know when<br/>
to buff and when not to. I&#39;m not sure if anyone still uses a single<br/>
puller in Hate, we always use a pull team. It&#39;s not the primary puller<br/>
that soaks up all the healing mana, it&#39;s the secondary puller that<br/>
brings it into a room.<br/>
<br/>
One other tidbit - aggro plays a large part in these zones on your<br/>
level. so if you go up at L46 play very conservatively. Oh, and expect<br/>
to die several times. Even in the best groups and the most skilled bards<br/>
are going to leave a few corpses. ;)<br/>
