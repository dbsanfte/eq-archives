<div id="ygrps-yiv-360683702">I never mentioned the botb, he asked what bards like thott wear and I<br/>
gave him a short answer.  I even gave you a tell (was someone using you<br/>
for tracking as it turns out) asking why you weren&#39;t there.  It is for<br/>
fun, it sounds like if you perceive the contest this way you may even<br/>
perceive the game this way, no longer worth the effort.  If I was still<br/>
around, I would have joined KNOWING ABSOLUTELY that I would lose, cause<br/>
I would have had fun trying (and probably would still be 59 even though<br/>
it would be 4 months after i hit it hehe).<br/>
<br/>
I was the only person in the arena at 2:00pm when Thott logged on there<br/>
and we grouped and talked for a couple hours up to the event.  He even<br/>
admitted that he could have the best equipment in the game and lose if<br/>
he couldn&#39;t play worth a damn.  The fact is, regardless of having the<br/>
best equipment of any bard in the game, he is an extraordinary player,<br/>
in PvP as well.<br/>
<br/>
Then I (49 monk now) killed my old rival Hobben, the co-leader of AL,<br/>
with a couple wizards I recruited which made the whole day worthwhile!<br/>

<br/>
So, what Shada (retired) doesn&#39;t say outright is that there is no point<br/>
for<br/>
anyone to enter the &quot;BoB&quot; besides Aftathott.  To completely refrain from<br/>
entering would be the best comment on these equipment contests.<br/>
<br/>
He who has the most time to play with the guild of most dedicated<br/>
players,<br/>
wins.  Simple.<br/>
