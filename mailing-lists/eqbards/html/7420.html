&gt; Just out of curiosity, do spell casters skills (conjuration, abjuration,<br/>

&gt; skills cap at 250-255, I&#39;d say we have a damn good arguement.<br/>

255 at level 50.  Bear in mind most of the high level bard<br/>
songs probably didn&#39;t exist when they first set our musical<br/>
skill caps at 200.  I vote that we add it to the petition.<br/>
<br/>
There is the possibility however that we&#39;re capped at 200 for<br/>
whatever reason they decided to cap melee skills at 200.<br/>
