<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500417651">when this happens, do you notice your meter spiking to 99% PL then slowly<br/>
going back down to 0%?  i know this is a long shot, but that started<br/>
happening to me this week out of nowhere.  the screen would lock up for a<br/>
few seconds and the PL would spike then go back to 0.  i replaced the nic<br/>
and it seems to be gone.<br/>
