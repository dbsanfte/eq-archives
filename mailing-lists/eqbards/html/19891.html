<div id="ygrps-yiv-434880230">A Singing Breastplate is found on the server on Trakanon -- who had never,<br/>
to my knowledge, been killed before.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure this can reasonably be blamed on Verant???<br/>
<br/>
Did they force Fires of Heaven to go out and kill Trakanon right after<br/>
the last patch to find the breastplate and shut up bards?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it perhaps true it has been there all along. And it could as easily<br/>
have dropped the Cobalt bReastplate, etc but Verant got lucky in the<br/>
loot roll?<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re being a bit paranoid here. Assuming the worst, etc.<br/>

&gt;	Hmmm - Bards complain publicly that certain Singing Armor <br/>
&gt;pieces have never<br/>
&gt;dropped.  Lots of Bumps on the BBS.  No response from Verant; but one<br/>
&gt;assumes they saw the Thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	A patch goes on the server.  THEN a Singing Breatplate is found on a<br/>
&gt;server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Could this be coincidence?  Did they find an error in the <br/>
&gt;Drop Tables and<br/>
&gt;secretly fix it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	We will never know for sure... </span></blockquote></div>
