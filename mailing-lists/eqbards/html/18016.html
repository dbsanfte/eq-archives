<div id="ygrps-yiv-234039271">my guild killed the Spiroc Lord a couple nights ago.  i wasn&#39;t there as i<br/>
worked all day but when i got home i was able to hear how the fights were<br/>
going and went to sleep right before they attacked.  i guess it is only the<br/>
second Spiroc Lord to be killed on all servers.  i don&#39;t know how tough he<br/>
was, i believe it was getting him alone that was the hard part.  i&#39;ve missed<br/>
all of our sky fights other than the duel-wielding dojo, have to put in so<br/>
much time up there and with work and the baby it&#39;s tough. <br/>

&gt; the Plane of<br/>
&gt; Sky.  This is basically what happened.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Day 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Day 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Day 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did <br/>
&gt; some poking<br/>
&gt; around on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric <br/>
&gt; on pegasus </span></blockquote></div>
