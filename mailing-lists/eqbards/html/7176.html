 </span></blockquote>Well, I certainly don&#39;t do the dance. I was all excited about it when I got<br/>
to 16, but to my dismay, I don&#39;t do the dance! :( I even left my computer<br/>
on, and put my bard in a safe place just so I could max her skill out to see<br/>
if maybe that was the problem, but it isn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s just on some servers<br/>
that female bards don&#39;t? I&#39;ll ask on my server if this is the case.<br/>
