<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899009472">Sorry about posting off-topic but for some reason I have email access but<br/>
not Internet access. As a result, I can&#39;t post this question on EQVault.<br/>
<br/>
Last night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was attacked by the<br/>
Spider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never seen this NPC<br/>
before so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we killed a lot of<br/>
giant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, after we killed<br/>
her, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  Right-clicking on<br/>
the item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t mention anything<br/>
like Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever heard of this<br/>
item.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking it may be a<br/>
quest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison sac from the<br/>
Queen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking like a kidney.<br/>
My guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used by a rogue to<br/>
create poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been implemented yet.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP but if its<br/>
part of a quest would like to try and solve it.  <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>
night.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named fairie whose<br/>
name I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In addition to the<br/>
Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  There were several<br/>
groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures.  The general<br/>
consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these creatures caused<br/>
Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>
enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant has started to<br/>
beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar additions in other<br/>
zones?  <br/>
