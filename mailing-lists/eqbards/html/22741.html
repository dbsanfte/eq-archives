<div id="ygrps-yiv-543535211">Hehe every time my group is fighting a mob that can charm, we always make<br/>
sure no one attacks it until the mob has charmed me.  I always make it a<br/>
point to remove my weapons before I attack.  It pretty much negates the risk<br/>
of fighting mobs that can charm.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to your last statement, I guess thats one reason why bard NPCs<br/>
are such wimps.<br/>

charmed, which was a lot back in the days when shaman npc mobs could<br/>
charm, I never once played a song. The AI doesn&#39;t appearantly think<br/>
songs are spells.<br/>
