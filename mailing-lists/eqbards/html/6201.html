<br/>
Unrest is going to be a huge challenge for you!  Find the good spots away<br/>
from the major traffic patterns and be ready to zone in a flash!  Sometimes<br/>
be ready to go run hide somewhere far from the zone if a lot of high level<br/>
nasty things come out.<br/>
<br/>
The song analysis said that they stack with the higher level song Guardian<br/>
Rythmns - bout only one at a time:<br/>
<br/>
Guardian & Elemental<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
Guardian & Purifying<br/>
<br/>
not<br/>
<br/>
Elemental & Purifying<br/>
<br/>
If you would please kill all of those death beetles & tormented deads - I<br/>
might come back and re-visit that place!  Hehe, I&#39;ll be happy to pull all<br/>
then dry and dark boned skellies off you!<br/>

		Hello,<br/>
<br/>
		I am a level 16 Bard (love the dance song ;)) and am just<br/>
now starting for<br/>
		fight in Unrest.  I owuld love to be able to weave Purifying<br/>
and Elemental<br/>
		rhythms for my party in there, but they don&#39;t seem to stack.<br/>
In the song<br/>
		analysis, however, it says that they can be.  Any<br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
