<div id="ygrps-yiv-770276832">Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>
missed notes everytime. It never fired. Are those good enough?<br/>

&gt; As I said, my skills are all at or above 190, and approaching 200. My<br/>
&gt; regrets that your Brass skills are poor, perhaps a little practice is in<br/>
&gt; order. I have tested this and as I said several times I am missing notes<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; songs I NEVER missed notes on before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to have sympathy for you, when you turn a suggested explanation<br/>
into<br/>
an irrelevant attack on my brass skills.  If you&#39;ve done testing, then show<br/>
us<br/>
the numbers.  So far everyone who has posted numbers, as far as I can tell,<br/>
is<br/>
showing perfectly reasonable missed note rates.  If you have evidence to the<br/>
contrary, if anyone does, we can start to reasonably believe there&#39;s a<br/>
difference, but most people seem to not be experiencing what you are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is server specific, btw, since John Kim, who also says his<br/>
missed note rates are up, is on the same server as I am, and I haven&#39;t<br/>
experienced it.<br/>
