<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473592673">Ive been beta testing DAoC and this weekend I placed an order for it :) So<br/>
yeah I like it..<br/>
At 51th level Im pretty sick of EQ :( First time since beta of EQ that I can<br/>
say that...<br/>
Now exp and gear is getting to a point where my casual style just dont hack<br/>
it anymore.<br/>
Getting a group can take its time and in 2 hours my bar dont move a bit..<br/>
And gear.. I mostly still wear my lambent and have little money to buy new<br/>
gear and getting them is also off my limit.<br/>
Ohh well its my first real low point since March 99. <br/>
When I get DAoC (in 14 days hopefully) I will /camp EQ for a bit<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still playing EQ, but I have DAoC preordered and should get <br/>
&gt; it today.  My group (9 of us) all plan to try to install and <br/>
&gt; play tonight.  We are going to the Midgard realm and I plan <br/>
&gt; to play a Skald first and Healer or Shaman second.  Charisma <br/>
&gt; seems to be high as a bard attribute again.  And you <br/>
&gt; specialize between song, weapon and parry skills.  Boy am I <br/>
&gt; confused, but I suppose EQ seemed complex at the beginning <br/>
&gt; too.  I plan to max song, with a weapon close behind and then <br/>
&gt; throw some points in parry.  Not sure about charisma, <br/>
&gt; strength and constitution initial distribution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this is an EQ list, but I was wondering if anyone else <br/>
&gt; is looking to see if the grass is greener.  I hope you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mind.  I am a member of the DAoC group, but that is general <br/>
&gt; and not bard specific.  I have also found some bard related <br/>
&gt; sites for DAoC if anyone is interested.  Let me know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you on line somewhere,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Excellent!  I&#39;ll give it a try tonight since my DAoC hasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; arrived yet ;-)<br/>
&gt; That was my biggest gripe with EQ which probably still won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have changed<br/>
&gt; enough.  You can&#39;t even begin to handle mobs 1-on-1 that are <br/>
&gt; many levels<br/>
&gt; below you.  Many times even when they are too far below you to provide<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
