<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080185437">No, proc still doesn&#39;t work :(  I&#39;ve /bugged it, posted a couple times on<br/>
the gameplay forum and sent an email to Abashi.  No aknowledgement<br/>
whatsoever, so I don&#39;t expect it to get fixed anytime soon.<br/>
I&#39;m dying to get that dagger.  I see from the spoiler sites it drops in<br/>
Karnor&#39;s.  Anywhere specific or is it just one of those 1 in 1000 drops?<br/>

ooh ok, i can&#39;t keep trackof all this info! =)<br/>
i thought someone selling one in karnor&#39;s told me that.<br/>
<br/>
so does the proc on the sabre still not work?  i agree with Gendal on the<br/>
dagger, i love tishan&#39;s clash.  as a wiz i used it a ton, sometimes i liked<br/>
stunning more than nuking.  but there are so many new graphics for weapons<br/>
out there, no reason ours shouldn&#39;t as well =/<br/>
