<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208658005">I have never been back since the patch.  Nothing but horror stories on every<br/>
server.  A friend got feared into the gate by Cyndreela and lost 4 bubbles<br/>
of experience before he got back.  A bard friend had his corpse in the plane<br/>
for 2 weeks.  Until i see official word that place is off limits to me =)<br/>
