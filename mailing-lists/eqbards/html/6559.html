<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208658005">I have never been back since the patch.  Nothing but horror stories on every<br/>
server.  A friend got feared into the gate by Cyndreela and lost 4 bubbles<br/>
of experience before he got back.  A bard friend had his corpse in the plane<br/>
for 2 weeks.  Until i see official word that place is off limits to me =)<br/>

&gt; success in PoF since <br/>
&gt; the update, and if so do you have any tips for us over on <br/>
&gt; Veeshan. (I just <br/>
&gt; got 46 recently, and I&#39;m not looking forward to losing it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are countless 46+ ppl on Veeshan, but everyone is <br/>
&gt; afraid to go to PoF <br/>
