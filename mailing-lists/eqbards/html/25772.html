<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907973125">Hmmm...what did you hunt, and what was your technique in Burning Woods?<br/>
I&#39;ve avoided it, because Chant of Flame doesn&#39;t stick on much of anything in<br/>
there, and it&#39;s way easy to aggro wurms and hornets.  I&#39;ve been sticking to<br/>
places where I can pulse lvl 49 selos, and triple chant.  Takes forever when<br/>
one chant is rendered useless.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also nice now to not have to worry about getting SoW to triple chant<br/>
kite.  :)<br/>

 Hmmm.  I grouped at orc hill from 4-7 and then went to Crushbone until 10.<br/>
From there I went to the commons (soloed a bit in butcherblock first tho) --<br/>
killed orcs in the commons till 12, then I did Dervs in the west commons<br/>
till 15 -- lake Rathetear until 18 -- East Karana to 19 then lake of ill<br/>
omen till 30 (The front of the goblin fort is great with lament to pull,<br/>
/bellows to soften them up and then all instrument twist).   Spent some time<br/>
in Rathe Mtns after that learning to charm kite and then Dalnir&#39;s crypt<br/>
until 33 or 34, Overthere until 36 and then EW where I soloed from 38 to 49<br/>
there.  Went to Burning Woods after that and soloed until 53.<br/>
Since then I&#39;ve usually grouped because it&#39;s much safer -- xp loss post 50<br/>
is unbelievable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;d be really great would be if a couple of real pros would list <br/>
where they soloed for each level(s) on their way up, like &quot;from 12-16 <br/>
I killed monsters in zone X through melee, then up to 20 I kited Pink <br/>
Volvo Demons who conned yellow, then...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually started my own list just to find out where to solo <br/>
at &quot;higher&quot; levels (people try to say you should give it up after <br/>
about 12th, but I prefer solo)...Soloing Everquest,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/soloing/">http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/soloing/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to post what I know about soloing, and data I&#39;m <br/>
accumulating, like lists of soloable MObs (monsters) for each level, <br/>
tricks for soloing better (how to automatically raise your sense <br/>
direction, forage, mend, and other skills as fast as possible, no <br/>
button-clicking required), and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that both people with questions and people with advice <br/>
will join the list and post, and we can get a really good <br/>
infosite/faq going after a while.<br/>
