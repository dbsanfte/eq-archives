&gt; I use a Pentium II 450 with 128MB RAM, a 32 MB GeForce card and a SB Live.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct and correct.  GeForce is the state of the art.  But NVidia has a new<br/>
chip based on the GeForce chip called the NV15.  It&#39;s not live yet but it&#39;s<br/>
projected for release either late summer or early fall.  The chip is,<br/>
currently, roughly 2-4x faster than the GeForce.  Impressive technology to<br/>
say the least.  I use a TNT2 Ultra with a PIII 550.  The special graphics<br/>
components of the PIII chipset do help with video a great deal (and in some<br/>
ways fill in for the lack of the GeForce card) which is why I&#39;m holding out<br/>
for the NV15.  For $200-$300 I expect a lot more performane enhancment than<br/>
I will get from a GeForce.  On a PIII 550 the increase is there, but it&#39;s<br/>
not really worth $300 bucks ;)  On a non PIII system (ie:  Without Intel&#39;s<br/>
graphics architecture introduced on the PIII chip) the GeForce is a<br/>
significant improvement.<br/>
<br/>
There are some really awesome sites out there that detail the pro&#39;s and<br/>
con&#39;s of the GeForce card.  It&#39;s a GREAT card on ANY system.  It&#39;s just not<br/>
$300 great to me (I&#39;ll wait for the next gen cards coming out later this<br/>
year ;)<br/>
<br/>
And yes:  EQ&#39;s performance (once you&#39;re past a certain processor speed) is<br/>
entirely handled by the Video card (and any video boost from the processor).<br/>
Sound affects it as well though.  The game is faster if you turn off sound<br/>
effects and knock realism back to 0.  But it is REALLY boring without sound<br/>
;)<br/>
