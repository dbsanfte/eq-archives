<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992704205">Hehe, the more things change the more they stay the same.  First off, the<br/>
difference between good play and bad play in this game can be worlds apart<br/>
but there is this _huge_ middle part of merely mediocre play that a lot of<br/>
people fall into.  Most ad-hoc or pick-up groups are gonna be very mediocre.<br/>
Most of the time, groups fite 1 or 2 mobs - the occasional bad pull and you<br/>
have to contend with crowd control. The occasional train and you need to<br/>
evac.  You don&#39;t really see a lot of mid 20&#39;s trying multiple group raids -<br/>
even though there are prolly good spots for this (Upper Guk, CT Tae room,<br/>
Avatar room?).  So, it&#39;s not til mid 40&#39;s where you have the occasional<br/>
place where 2 6-packs are needed.  And then Dragon raids where it requires<br/>
multiple groups.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people just muddle their way to 50 - you don&#39;t get more xp for<br/>
better play - you do get xp for just mindlessly killing guard after guard<br/>
after guard, or frog or kobold or spec or Cyndrella.  How many ppl ding 50<br/>
in a Mistmoore Castle raid?  How many ppl lose xp in Planes raids?  But any<br/>
ways my point is  you don&#39;t _need_ to be good to get to the next level - you<br/>
merely need to endure (mostly boredom). <br/>
<br/>
Now that brings us to the wiz-bang.  Last knight I was helping some friends<br/>
in CT.  They were a mid-20&#39;s group and were camping the fish bowl (brown<br/>
room?) - this round room on the way to some temple - it was the first time<br/>
for me there so I was not real familiar - it might be on the way to the<br/>
avatar&#39;s room.  So they were SK, War, Druid, Bard, Wiz, Wiz. I was<br/>
babysitting and trying to pull singles for them.  Well the wiz bang would<br/>
open every time with his biggest nuke and take a beating.  And them I pulled<br/>
2 and we got a room spawn.  Ok, should be no problem - I can pixie 2 of them<br/>
easily or even attack and tank &#39;em.  <br/>
<br/>
So I got 2 lizzies messed nicely while they fight the other one.  Well, the<br/>
tanks are fighting the other one and Mr Wiz-bang decides to nuke a mezzed<br/>
liz - gimme a break!  Even after wards when we tried to talk about it - he<br/>
told us he just decided to nuke one of the mezzed ones as his way of helping<br/>
kill it.  Who knows why this seemed like a good idea to him?  When we said<br/>
assist the puller - he had no clue what we were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
And ya gotta remember that some players are real life 14 year&#39;s old.  Yes,<br/>
level 50&#39;s can be 14 - although they are prolly lots closer to 15 &lt;g&gt; And I<br/>
have even run into the situation where I meet someone and get told &quot;this is<br/>
sonso&#39;s brother...&quot;  Meaning its his older/younger playing the account<br/>
(farming for some item - hehe.) <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I have taken to saying and it seems to help people lower<br/>
their defenses when it&#39;s their turn to accept a tip is: &quot;Hey guys, if I<br/>
don&#39;t see you medding or I forget to play heal song - just feel free to yell<br/>
at me and say &#39;Sylly!  need mana/heal song&#39; and remember to say &#39;Sylly -<br/>
Stop song&#39; before you run to pull or before you cast invis - ok?&quot;  I try to<br/>
set the tone a bit lighter so they can see I am willing to listen to them -<br/>
maybe they will listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>

		I can say from personal experience that it is annoying when<br/>
other people are<br/>
		telling me what songs to play, especially since I still hear<br/>
&quot;play the jig&quot;<br/>
		for mana. (I&#39;m level 24).<br/>
<br/>
		But this works both ways, I try not to tell strangers<br/>
directly how to play<br/>
		their characters. I bug my friends all the time and give<br/>
them<br/>
		pointers/advice, but it would be touchier with strangers.</div>
