&gt;else jokes about it, someone else doesn&#39;t get the joke and<br/>
&gt;takes it as truth, and someone who didn&#39;t know any of this was<br/>
&gt;going on hears the (now wildly distorted) rumor from the last<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the truth. There are a lot of dumb people playing. This morning <br/>
someone in Lake Rathe was shouting for someone to group with them and go to <br/>
1000 island. I shout back &#39;not right now, I&#39;m dressing&#39; (I couldn&#39;t help it, <br/>
I had just woken up, heh). The next thing I know this person is giving me a <br/>
tell &#39;so when you&#39;re finished getting dressed do you want to group?&#39; ACK. Me <br/>
humor was wasted (pathetic attempt though it may have been).<br/>
