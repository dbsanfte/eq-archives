<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680559989">I think everyone has done this.  I&#39;m surprised you made it all the way to<br/>
level 30 without hitting the &#39;a&#39; key before now.  I remapped mine to the &#39;0&#39;<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d share this little tid-bit of idiocy with y&#39;all....<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday, I finally decided to go get my Lambent Bracer (my first<br/>
lambent piece). I contacted my druid friend and had him gate me to<br/>
lavastorm.  I entered the temple and made my way to the two quest NPC&#39;s<br/>
(forget their names).  I was checking and re-checking, to make sure I had<br/>
the correct components/cash.  I was asking about all the Lambent pieces -<br/>
insuring that my list was still up-to-date.  As soon as I typed the &#39;a&#39; in<br/>
lambent, I started attacking the female NPC.  I made a futile attempt to<br/>
flee, but I made it no further than 10 paces before I became worm food.<br/>
<br/>
My friend asks : &quot;What are you doing in Greater faydark?&quot;<br/>
I respond : &quot;You won&#39;t believe what I just did...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, that was about the single dumbest thing I&#39;ve done in this<br/>
game yet.  Since I was feeling pretty bad about myself (I must admit it was<br/>
pretty hilarious though) I wanted to see if any of you fine bards had<br/>
boneheaded experiences of your own to share.<br/>
