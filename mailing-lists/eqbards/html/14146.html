<div id="ygrps-yiv-875190186">I can back up the claim that Mask of Deception gives ultravision fine. I<br/>
used it crossing through Neriak as well as in LGuk and got the blue tinge<br/>
from it. It seemed to hold up also as I sang my accelerando through Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t notice whether this effect went away when I have turned off a song,<br/>
though.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I posted earlier that I wasn&#39;t gaining ultravision when I <br/>
&gt; activated the DE<br/>
&gt; illusion from the Mask of Deception.  Someone followed up that the<br/>
&gt; ultravision from the Mask worked fine for them.  Would like <br/>
&gt; to hear from<br/>
&gt; other people who have a Mask of Deception to see if they get <br/>
&gt; ultravision<br/>
&gt; when activating the illusion.  Specifically need to know what <br/>
&gt; race you are.<br/>
&gt; Its possible that the ultravision works for humans (who only <br/>
&gt; have normal<br/>
&gt; vision) but may possibly be broken for wood elves and/or <br/>
&gt; half-elves (who<br/>
&gt; have infravision).  BTW my bard is a wood elf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This request doesn&#39;t apply to people who have the Guise of <br/>
&gt; the Deceiver.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
