 </span></blockquote>This has changed so often I don&#39;t even try to figure out how<br/>
it works anymore.  When did you test this?  I tried it soon<br/>
after Accel stopped breaking root - Chain would break root,<br/>
but the root icon would remain.  So you wouldn&#39;t be rooted<br/>
anymore, but Accel would not take hold until the root icon<br/>
disappeared. That was over a month ago so it&#39;s possible it has<br/>
been changed again.<br/>
