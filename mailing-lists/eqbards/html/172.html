Juggling DOES cause a much higher incidence of &quot;missed notes&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
As to the drum&#39;s usefulness, I don&#39;t know who would say that it is not<br/>
useful until level 7.  The level five song is amazing with the drum, as I&#39;m<br/>
sure you all know.<br/>

&gt; A moment brother Jyzan,<br/>
&gt; you seem to be one of the most experienced of our brothers here, and i<br/>
&gt; would like you expert opinion on something.  while juggling songs i<br/>
&gt; have noticed that my hit percentage goes down.  yes i have tested it<br/>
&gt; but have no exact numbers.  when i juggle i hit less frequently, when i<br/>
&gt; sing one i hit more often.  maybe it is due to concentration needed on<br/>
&gt; the character&#39;s part? any observations are welcome.  also some posts<br/>
&gt; from yesterday mentioned that they didn&#39;t think the drum was usefull<br/>
&gt; till level 7.  accelerando is level 5 and the drum is extremely<br/>
&gt; beneficial to this song.  thank you for your time brother.<br/>
