<div id="ygrps-yiv-334184538">Personally, you need a druid.  Harmony ROCKS on DW gobs and I recommend the<br/>
Oasis.  I did it at 34 with a party of 3.  My brothers druid was 32 and my<br/>
wife&#39;s warrior was 33 also.  Basically, the druid goes down and area effect<br/>
harmonies ALL of them.  DO NOT USE LAMENT.  The gobs INSIDE the castle will<br/>
agro if you pull one from the outside and you will always end up with more<br/>
then one.  You can&#39;t get inside to lament them all, but Harmony effects them<br/>
all since it is area effect.  The warrior (yes, these are casters so you<br/>
will need some HP to get out of the water!) shoots one with a bow and runs<br/>
out of the water to the inn.  The druid then snared, I feared and we<br/>
proceeded to kill them for hours one at a time with very little downtime.<br/>
Have the druid save mana for heals though instead of burning and these<br/>
things have A LOT of HP so snare sometimes runs out near the end of the<br/>
battle.  Expect to have to re-snare.<br/>

&gt;     I WANT the lambent helm - and have the Mudwater Rune - so I need the<br/>
Opoline Helm.  I recall a discussion of these some time ago - and the<br/>
archive search engine at www.onelist.com is basically useless (trust me - I<br/>
tried...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I do recall (and have heard from others on the server) that the<br/>
problem of course is breaking the spawn; but I am looking for advice on what<br/>
levels the party needs to be and other pulling techniques (does harmony or<br/>
lament work, etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
