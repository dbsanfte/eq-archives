<div id="ygrps-yiv-155281308">how good are verant if they don&#39;t have a working backup beforehand :P<br/>
<br/>
I lost a couple of chars on test but it wasn&#39;t my main server but I still<br/>
think its a lame excuse, I mean are verant really gonna test out all the<br/>
uber items that aren&#39;t commonly available anymore? pigs will evolve and fly<br/>
sooner I think :)<br/>

Hate to play the devils advocate here, but maybe verant planned that solB<br/>

exploiting a bug for 10 hours?</div>
