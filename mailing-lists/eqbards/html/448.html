<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121766539">:My success rate for twisting songs with a 95 DEX and 45 singing/instrument<br/>
skill is probably less than 33%.  I&#39;ll start keeping track and see if I can<br/>
come up with an actual % rate instead of an estimate.<br/>
<br/>
I dont reall know about this, but with my level 8 bard, I can nearly always twist my Chant of Battle, Whistling Warsong, and Selo&#39;s fairly successfuly. I would say that my success rate is about 80%-90%.<br/>
<br/>
When I get the message &quot;You missed a note&quot;, I do keep pushing the song<br/>
button but usually I just keep getting the same message.  Only when the<br/>
first song runs out do I get to start another one.<br/>
<br/>
This doesnt seem to happen to me all that often, usually if I keep pressing the song button, it works on the 2nd or 3rd try.<br/>

&gt; Twisting songs: playing for instance Whistling Warsong and Anthem de Arms<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; that both shields are on the screen at once.  Singing one, getting the<br/>
&gt; shield up, then stop singing and starting another, then going back to the<br/>
&gt; first song to keep that shield up.  Some call playing three like this<br/>
&gt; juggling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have always managed to pull it off, even at lower levels.  When you miss<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; note, just immediately double click the icon you need again, should only<br/>
&gt; take a split second between each attempt until you get the graphical<br/>
&gt; pyrotechnics.  Doesn&#39;t seem that I miss notes that often, though, ever.  I<br/>
&gt; heard charisma had more effect on songs than dexterity.  Dexterity, to me,<br/>
&gt; seems like it would have an effect on more physical things like how often<br/>
&gt; one can get in blows with a weapon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hm, how often is it your missing notes anyway?  Perhaps should test this<br/>
&gt; with lv 1 bard with low charisma/dexterity high charisma/dexterity.  The<br/>
&gt; manual says that bards need intelligence, but I don&#39;t believe this.<br/>
