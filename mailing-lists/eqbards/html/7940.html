&gt; experience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>
&gt; this can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>
&gt; player who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>
&gt; advantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>
&gt; fight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>
&gt; likely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>
&gt; close match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>
&gt; group of six.<br/>

ask him for advice.  In groups though, I still wonder about my song<br/>
selections some time.  Soloing I use warsong, bellow, bellow, because I&#39;m<br/>
fighting white or yellow con&#39;sing monsters and I need the extra damage<br/>
from bellow to win the damage race.  In a group of two, I actually sing<br/>
anthem, warsong, bellow, since I am probably better equipped then my<br/>
groupmate and it would be better for me to tank, so I try and pull it on<br/>
myself.  In larger groups I sing anthem, healing, bellow, and I think<br/>
that&#39;s pretty much the standard right?  Obviously I drop the last song if<br/>
the lag gets too high, which is almost always bellow.<br/>
