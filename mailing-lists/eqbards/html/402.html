&gt; Your concerns really struck a nerve with me and I&#39;d like to share some of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; observations about life as a bard.  As mentioned in  previous reply, we<br/>
&gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things get hairy, we have the<br/>
&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>
&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit accellerando<br/>
at<br/>
<br/>
I lasted about 15 seconds.  I tried my damndest to get accell - but kept on<br/>
getting stunned...<br/>
While I was stunned the two cents and the legionaire were hitting me..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow down below 2 bars and<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between you and the orcs.<br/>
&gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Stupid me - didn&#39;t know you can hot-key a spell...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you have learned, fail.<br/>
&gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared to you, the more<br/>
likely<br/>
&gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher con.  It will fail<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low blue, you could solo a<br/>
camp<br/>
&gt; and clean it out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize they &quot;fixed&quot; that spell.  When I first got it - it wasn&#39;t<br/>
working.  Was soloing an orc camp in Lesser Feydark - (with a bunch of high<br/>
level guys - no prob that time) - and it didn&#39;t work.  I recall comments on<br/>
this list about it.  If there were comments that it was fixed - I must have<br/>
missed it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>
&gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group with and guage how<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like you had described,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in trouble and at the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown that they can be<br/>
&gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough would I let myself<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group then solo because I am<br/>
&gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to save someone whose<br/>
&gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing and dieing along side<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
<br/>
Well the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>
song to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>
doing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.  I<br/>
should have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>
usually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure they understand that<br/>
&gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is dear to you, you will do<br/>
&gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and teamwork has<br/>
developed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and Learn!)<br/>
Getting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>
