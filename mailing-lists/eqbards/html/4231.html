<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936244899"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; For those of you that don&#39;t recieve these messages in digest, the unwanted<br/>
&gt; threads are easy to delete.  The rest of us who use digest have to scroll<br/>
&gt; down through every single message, and the twinking thread is beating us<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; death.  PLEASE STOP THE THREAD!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here, here. I&#39;m beginning to think the people involved in this useless<br/>
discussion are all insisting on having the last word.  Somebody posts so the<br/>
others all have to respond.  Wash, rinse, and repeat.  Of course, they have<br/>
to quote the previous threads so the whole thing turns into a behemoth.  I<br/>
had to give up reading the digest version for both this list and the brewers<br/>
list.  Too many inconsiderate posters who had to no idea on how to cut and<br/>
paste their replies.  <br/>
