Subject: [eqbards] Cantana of Soothing<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know or has anyone heard if they are going to fix the name of<br/>
this song?  I&#39;ve been bugging it since I received it.  I&#39;m sure they meant<br/>
it to be Cantata of Soothing, but someone misspelled it as &quot;Cantana&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>
a minor point to be sure, but an annoying one nonetheless.<br/>
