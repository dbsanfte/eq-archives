If it happened to me?  Either they&#39;d fix it or I&#39;d be done with EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>
what customer service is about.  No it still wouldn&#39;t be a higher priority.<br/>
<br/>
I was only counting the people I know in RL personally.  I doubt anyone<br/>
knows an appropriate sample size in that way.  From seeing the boards<br/>
though, there are hundreds of posts on bard song bugs, very few on having<br/>
one&#39;s own corpse poof.<br/>
