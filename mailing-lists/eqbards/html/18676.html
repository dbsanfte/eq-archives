I don&#39;t think I switched to an all instrument attack until I was level 18.<br/>
At 18 you can play Chords of Disonance, Hymn of Restoration and Dennon&#39;s<br/>
Disruptive Discord to great advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Hand to hand caps much lower than our either melee skills. I believe that<br/>
the max gain is 3 points per level. Thus, at level 11 your 1 h slash will<br/>
cap at 60 but your hand to hand will cap at 34.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to do an instrument attack, I suggest going against mobs<br/>
that do not dot you. Avoid spiders and asps. Stick with Young Kodiaks, Giant<br/>
Scarabs and Orcs (if you are staying in the Freeport vicinity) At level 12<br/>
you gain Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow and you may want to consider taking on<br/>
wisps. Wisps are magic only to hit, but in a an all song attack, that&#39;s not<br/>
a problem. (try to pick up magic gloves though so you can punch the wisps)<br/>
Wisps are great exp and good loot, just be careful because they hit hard at<br/>
lower levels.<br/>

Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
I tried my first all-instrument attack last night.  I was battling blues in<br/>
the Southeast corner of West Commons and the Southwest corner of East<br/>
Commons.  First I tried a giant spider in WC.  It took me down to two<br/>
bubbles, but I won.  And I got hand to hand up to 3!  Woohoo!  So I tried<br/>
another spider, which also took me down to two bubbles, and got hand to hand<br/>
up to 4.  Then a ghoul showed up so I moved to EC and attacked an asp.<br/>
Well, an &quot;asp&quot; got whooped alright, but it wasn&#39;t the snake.  <br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
So I retrieve my corpse and try another asp.  I show my wisdom by zoning<br/>
before I die, but display my lack of intelligence by not leaving myself<br/>
enough HPs to survive the poison.  I loose consciousness the minute I hit<br/>
WC, never getting Hymn started.  <br/>
<br/>
DONG!  You have lost a level!  Welcome back to level 10, dummy!  <br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
So I retrieve my corpse and ditch the instruments in favor of my FS 1H<br/>
slasher and kite shield (don&#39;t I feel twinked &lt;g&gt;) and look for some more<br/>
spiders.  I attack one and another joins in.  I swear this is the first time<br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen a giant spider assist another.  I mean I know spiders are<br/>
like that, but I&#39;ve just never seen it happen.  I&#39;ve also never noticed<br/>
spiders stunning me before.  I just BARELY make the zone.  <br/>
<br/>
Back on the EC side I try my luck with another asp.  Wicked close, this<br/>
battle.  I loose consciousness twice, but survive.  I search for another<br/>
snake but instead find a lesser mummy.  So I head back to WC.  <br/>
<br/>
An asp is there waiting for me.  I fair better with this one.  It&#39;s still a<br/>
close call, but I don&#39;t loose consciousness.  <br/>
<br/>
DING!  You have gained a level!  Welcome back to level 11!  Be more careful<br/>
this time, silly!  <br/>
<br/>
More careful?  Me?  Heh.  It occurs to me that if I can get my H to H skill<br/>
(currently at 5) up to where my 1H slash skill is (57) that I might just be<br/>
able to kick some asp.  WC is empty, so I zone back to EC and find another<br/>
serpent.  The battle commences but is not looking promising.  So I ditch the<br/>
lute mid-battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute<br/>
and this time don&#39;t stop playing until about 2/3 of the way through the<br/>
battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute and this<br/>
time stop playing the moment I switched to 3rd person view and discover I&#39;ve<br/>
actually found a nest of asps.  Run away!  Woohoo!  I equip my drum and get<br/>
my asp out of there.<br/>
<br/>
Back in WC I spy a spider creeping along.  I reequip my lute and this time<br/>
don&#39;t stop playing until...<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Back in Freeport a guildmate accuses me of hanging out at the tavern<br/>
drinking.  Why anyone would assume I&#39;m at a tavern just because they keep<br/>
seeing me in Freeport is beyond me.  But anyway, I run back to WC and<br/>
reequip my lute just long enough to bonk myself on the head with it, then I<br/>
put it away in favor of more conventional weaponry.   <br/>
<br/>
Another dead spider, another dead asp.  Things are looking up.  So I start<br/>
thinking about that hand to hand skill again, wondering how much damage I<br/>
*could* be doing.  Well... <br/>
<br/>
Little miss bard<br/>
did her shield discard<br/>
and picked up her lute to play<br/>
along came a spider<br/>
with poison insider her<br/>
saying &quot;Minstrel, this isn&#39;t your day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
I retrieve my corpse and equip my drum.  This time I don&#39;t stop playing<br/>
until I reach the tavern.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
