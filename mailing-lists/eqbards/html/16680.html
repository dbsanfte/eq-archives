<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-554387063">Couple of things on this:  I&#39;m the cleric in this group, we are a<br/>
regular group so soloing/pickup group is not an issue.  The 4 (still<br/>
trying to get it back to 6) of us play every Thurs (or some other night<br/>
if THurs is bad) night.  We email during the week to decide on our<br/>
target (s).<br/>
<br/>
As for guilds/ multi group events.  They are a LONG way off for us.  We<br/>
play once a week for like 5 hours.  We will be lucky to average half a<br/>
level a night pretty soon (right now we can still get a full lvl if we<br/>
get to our &quot;camp&quot; early, camp meaning where we set up, we don&#39;t camp<br/>
specific mobs for long, too boring).  Doing some quick math, that means<br/>
we&#39;ll hit lvl 45 more than a year from now (I am factoring in a few<br/>
missed weeks for holidays, plus I know we will miss some during the<br/>
summer as 3/4 of us have a beach house for the entire summer)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re discussing looking for a guild (on Veeshan).  It wouldn;t really<br/>
change our play, except it would make it easier to find two more people,<br/>
plus we&#39;d be able to help/get help with specific items/mobs.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if it will happen though.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, since bards are probably pretty creative, I need to pick my last<br/>
name.  I am a dwarven cleric named Legba.  Our group is the Wandering<br/>
Hues, and we all take the last name of O&#39;&lt;color&gt;.  Example the warrior<br/>
is Willae O&#39;Grae.  I was thinking taking blue (for healing).  What do<br/>
you all think?  (O&#39;Blue O&#39;Blew O&#39;Blough O&#39;Bluwe etc...)  Think blue is<br/>
the right color for cleric?<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
