<div id="ygrps-yiv-83676796">Another thing about raids that I learned not long ago... If your guild has a<br/>
raid planned, and some folks are already there (kind of like apick-up<br/>
group), DO NOT GO! :op  8 full groups, and everyone died (and we were led<br/>
through the pit , of all places).  IIRC, the raid leader&#39;s entire strategy<br/>
came from the movie Ghostbusters... &quot;Get her!&quot;  Oy vey.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic though, with singing Elemental Rhythms and some cleric<br/>
buffs, my resists were all near 200 and she laid not a single spell on me.<br/>
Claws and teeth on the other hand...<br/>

&gt; level is the most important resist item.  so the lower level you are, the<br/>
&gt; higher you want your resists at.  generally an unbuffed 100CR or 100FR is<br/>
&gt; good for vox or nag, respectively.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Btw what would you all consider the minimum resist gear for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard of 47th<br/>
&gt; &gt; level to wear at a nag/vox raid?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Currently I dont have anything special in the ways of resists...<br/>
