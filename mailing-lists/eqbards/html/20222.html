<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151058914">I&#39;m in a guild called the &quot;Sacred Brotherhood of Wolves&quot; on E&#39;ci and I<br/>
believe we have 3 bards although one is a level 14 secondary and the other<br/>
is a level 30 something primary who doesn&#39;t seem to play that often.  I am<br/>
basically our guild&#39;s bard.  I believe we have one high level enchanter and<br/>
one or two low level enchanters who are secondaries.  Our guild is primarily<br/>
composed of Druids (surprise surprise).  It&#39;s kind of nice to be in such<br/>
exclusive demand ;-)<br/>

Wow, didn&#39;t know Valeyardb was still around.  Been a long time since we ran<br/>
into each other.  There sure seem to be a heck of a lot more bards on E&#39;ci<br/>
than on Sol Ro, the other server I play on semi-regularly.<br/>

I&#39;m in Militia these days, and we have at least 4 high-level bards.  Myself,<br/>
<br/>
Guibu, Vasen, and Valeyardb.<br/>

&gt;bit.  He still posts on The Concert Hall a lot so I know he still plays. <br/>
&gt;Same for John Kim (Kaearia on the Concert Hall).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I know, both of those reprobates are still lurking around here <br/>
somewhere.  I&#39;ll send you a line if I happen to spot one of them.<br/>
