<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952052398">Well, this was my response to this idiot.  Apparently he doesn&#39;t appreciate<br/>
exactly what we can do, or has grouped with a bard somewhere along the way<br/>
that didn&#39;t know their craft very well.<br/>

Uhhh, ok - so don&#39;t group with a bard.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 17th lvl, nearly 18th lvl bard - bards are a special breed. A good<br/>
bard is a SUPPORT character - they are the type that enjoy making everyone<br/>
else the hero, - in the background.<br/>
<br/>
I hear folks like SoW better, fine, but with my drum, my group runs faster<br/>
than cheetah - and it doesn&#39;t wear off.<br/>

I hear folks like SoW better, but SoW doesn&#39;t break you out of root when<br/>
that ghoul has you rooted firmly in the doorway.<br/>
<br/>
Our mission is to make everyone ELSE better, and give that edge to a group.<br/>
<br/>
You wanna call me an xp leech, go right ahead, don&#39;t group with me, but<br/>
turn me loose with two weapons, dual wield AND bellow - I&#39;m not that bad at<br/>
dealing damage either. The nice thing about bellow, it may only do 10 dmg a<br/>
pop at 18th, but it&#39;s VERY fast, and NEVER misses. Throw 10dmg into a fight<br/>
every 2-3 seconds, it does add up.<br/>
<br/>
People that want to be in the spotlight need to be wizards or warriors,<br/>
people that enjoy enabling others to be better - even when the fools don&#39;t<br/>
realize they are, pick barding as a class.<br/>
<br/>
I see a bard that doesn&#39;t know their craft much the same as some mages that<br/>
seem to think they are tanks and rush into melee. Very irritating to try to<br/>
keep them alive.<br/>
<br/>
All the classes in EQ have strengths and weakness, they are meant to work<br/>
TOGETHER. Sometimes that wildcard in the group is what turns the tide from<br/>
a long walk back to your corpse.<br/>
