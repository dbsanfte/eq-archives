hehe<br/>

Well, as some of you may have noticed, I had discovered what I had thought <br/>
to be a bonus that the Unicorn Horn has to wind-based songs.  Yeah, I know, <br/>
wind songs don&#39;t do much with bonuses (can you levitate 20% better?), but <br/>
there are a few cases where it does make a difference (ie. Pixie Strike&#39;s MR <br/>
debuff, possibly others).<br/>
<br/>
Well, after careful testing of my Unicorn Horn and a standard store-bought <br/>
flute, I have determined that the Unicorn Horn does add an addition 5% to <br/>
wind-based songs where it can actually make a difference.  Standing in the <br/>
Freeport bank, I pixie striked myself several times with a store-bought <br/>
flute and my MR was reduced by 12 points.   Then I pixie striked myself with <br/>
the Unicorn horn and my MR was reduced by 15 points.  I believe my starting <br/>
MR was 48 at the time (I had removed some of my MR gear so that I could hit <br/>
myself more reliably).<br/>

OK, maybe not.  Minotaur horns supposedly have a 15% bonus and they&#39;re much <br/>
easier to find and kill than a very tough 40+ semi-rare mob.  But then it <br/>
has that fabulous light source capability and a whopping 4 charges of <br/>
Purge...  =8^)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, while meeting up with my wizzie friend in NK last night, we <br/>
discovered 5, yes FIVE HG&#39;s roaming around which we quickly charmed and <br/>
nuked with one load of mana...   Of course the richest one had a whopping <br/>
2pp on him... =8^P<br/>
