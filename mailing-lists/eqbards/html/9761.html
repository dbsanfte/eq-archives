<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-986208801">Has anyone else had this song (Lament) behave weirdly on them?  There have<br/>
been a handful of occasions where I get the message (&quot;XXXX looks sad&quot;),<br/>
attempt to pull another nearby MOB, and then both of them come running (even<br/>
the lamented one).  Just recently, I was trying to pull some elites out of<br/>
the king room.  I lulled the patriarch (got the &quot;sad&quot; message) and then<br/>
everything started coming at me (including the patriarch).  Like I said,<br/>
this has only happened maybe 2 or 3 times in my whole career.  A druid<br/>
friend of mine also stated that she occasionally has the same thing happen<br/>
with Harmony.  It&#39;s somewhat similar to how Pixie Strike or Apalling Screech<br/>
apparently do nothing, even though you get the message.<br/>

&gt; I used this song to great effect while in permafrost way back <br/>
&gt; when I was<br/>
&gt; level 16 (oh so long ago).  It was great.   Resist rates were <br/>
&gt; rather low<br/>
&gt; and I could usually pull 1 or 2 at a time which is good for <br/>
&gt; perma.. I then<br/>
&gt; began adventuring in outdoor zones where harmony is much more <br/>
&gt; effective due<br/>
&gt; to it being aoe and not agroing monsters if it fails.<br/>
