&gt;I remember reading a while back (I think), not sure if it was here or<br/>
&gt;somewhere else a hint from GZ that we might be getting a new charm type song<br/>
&gt;for one of our missing high level song slots.<br/>
&gt;Does anyone else remember reading this?  If so, could you repost?  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;find it anywhere.<br/>

was anxious to see how we would adapt to it.  I think he was referring to <br/>
Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation.<br/>
