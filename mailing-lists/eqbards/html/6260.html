<div id="ygrps-yiv-9713650">all the way til 50 i never really used the charm song much, dunno i guess i<br/>
never got around to practicing it so i could be effective, and situations<br/>
rarely came up to use it.  well anyway it is kinda a bit late cause i can&#39;t<br/>
charm mobs above level 38, but it really is an incredible song.  i was bored<br/>
last night so i played around with some sand giants in oasis.  my first<br/>
mistake while having one SG fight another was starting this process at half<br/>
health.  my second mistake was not being in selo&#39;s mode during the fight.  i<br/>
don&#39;t think you need jboots or sow.  basically i charmed one SG, have him<br/>
/pet attack the second SG, and play selo&#39;s for about 3 pulses or so, in<br/>
between each recharming of the pet.  while in selo&#39;s, if my pet SG breaks<br/>
out of charm, i am plenty fast to run away and have time to recharm.  not<br/>
playing selo&#39;s is what got me killed first try (told you i wasn&#39;t good at<br/>
charm hehe).  well next two tries i killed 4 SGs without losing any health.<br/>
its all playing selo&#39;s in between charms and timing your recharming.  i<br/>
thought that you would always have to tell your pet every time you charm him<br/>
to attack the target, and keep switching back and forth between pet and<br/>
target.  THIS is what i did not know, and what kept me from using charm for<br/>
so long.  it is a lot easier than i thought.  once you charm and /pet attack<br/>
once, you can keep your pet as your current target because as soon as you<br/>
recharm, it goes back to its last command.  boy i wish i knew and used this<br/>
song a lot more during previous levels.  silly battle bard me.<br/>

&gt; Just wait until you are level 40 though, and the fun with <br/>
&gt; giants really begins.<br/>
&gt; Every other class I know except druids whines they can&#39;t solo <br/>
&gt; generally, and I<br/>
&gt; do so often. 2 giants, a giant + griffin, etc are extremely <br/>
&gt; easy to control.<br/>
&gt; However, I do not use selo&#39;s, because if you get bashed you <br/>
&gt; are at the giant&#39;s<br/>
&gt; mercy. For soloing I use Journeyman Boots. </span></blockquote></div>
