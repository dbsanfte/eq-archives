<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029175342">Hey wait a minute are you calling Meee obtuse?  Heh heh, and I thought I<br/>
caught you on one, oh well.  What can I say I like to talk and hate<br/>
inaccuracy ;)<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t noticed the fall part, but it makes sense since those falls are not<br/>
really straight down, how the heck does that occur?  Update synching between<br/>
client and server?  Of course jumping off the ramps in E Karana is not a<br/>
recommended method for escaping Mob&#39;s.  Another thing I noticed, Bellowing<br/>
helps as well.  That little bit it knocks them back has made the difference<br/>
for me a couple of times in Najena when I couldn&#39;t use accellerando and ran<br/>
out of stamina for jumping.<br/>

&gt; What, John made a mathematical error?  I am flabbergasted!  Its actually<br/>
&gt; safer than 1.414x by a long shot so long as you are 1.414x melee range<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; them when you turn.  They follow an arc inside the corner as you turn it,<br/>
&gt; not being smart enough to lead you and get the advantage of the triangle.<br/>

Heh.  I&#39;d deleted this from my post as being too obtuse.  A<br/>
little bit of inaccuracy saves a ton of explanation.<br/>

&gt; the trees as they run into them but you will not be.  This allows one to<br/>
&gt; outrun some Mob&#39;s without using accellerando in heavily forested areas if<br/>
&gt; the MOB is close to your speed (like orcs).  I call this scraping the tail<br/>
&gt; off on a tree.  Of course one miscalculation where you run into the tree<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; they are on top of you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you fall as you run down a slope, that seems to put<br/>
some extra distance between you and the mob.<br/>
