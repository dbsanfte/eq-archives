<br/>
I loved this weapon, sought it for a long time and finally traded my combine<br/>
LS for it and 10pp when I was level 20ish...used it in my off-hand with the<br/>
dragoon dirk in primary for many levels and had a great time with the<br/>
roguish looks and quick attacks.  Finally replaced it at level 26 or so with<br/>
a silvery war axe.<br/>
<br/>
It is my opinion that this is a very nice weapon for bards who like the fast<br/>
attack and when used in combo with the dirk, the 2 point delay difference<br/>
makes the combo great for interrupting spellcasters when you are in your low<br/>
to mid twenties.  It also is very non-taxing on your stamina and you can<br/>
last through long fights with this combo with very little fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
So essentially I paid ~40pp for it and felt the investment well worth it, it<br/>
is a rare weapon to get a hold of and I just can&#39;t figure out why it isn&#39;t<br/>
more popular.  As a matter of fact I have it tucked away in my bank vault<br/>
because I just can&#39;t seem to bring myself to pawn it off after the length I<br/>
went through to get it ;-)  I keep thinking I will log in one day and<br/>
finally people will have suddenly realized they all want one and be willing<br/>
to pay me 100pp for it - HA!<br/>
