Necros, and later shadowknights have the engulfing darkness<br/>
spell which does the same thing as snare (although it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be as reliable).<br/>
<br/>
Bards get chain long before any of these mid-level dungeons<br/>
turn green.<br/>

A lot of classes can stun runners, giving you a chance to<br/>
root/kill them.  An enchanter friend I was grouped with did<br/>
this all the time - it had a minimum guaranteed duration so<br/>
was more reliable than root.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a good nuker, you don&#39;t even need that - a wizard<br/>
can drop them dead before they start to run.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you&#39;re working without a snarer, the first priority<br/>
for me would be to find an area you can pull to and still have<br/>
a reasonable amount of time to kill a mob when it runs.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, druids and rangers comprise probably half the<br/>
characters in the game.  :)  The only people I really feel for<br/>
are warriors, rogues, and monks.<br/>
