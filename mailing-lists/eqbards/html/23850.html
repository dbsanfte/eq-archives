<div id="ygrps-yiv-742404149">Hehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My only question is, how can a person play more than one character at a time<br/>
effectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s weird being<br/>
high enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more than enough to<br/>
keep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a warrior at the<br/>
same time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>
situational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>
<br/>
I would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person was trying to be<br/>
2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk, multiple mob<br/>
dungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a good thing.  :)<br/>

Nearly 30 after a few days in Dalnir!  Woo!<br/>

<br/>
To answer some questions:<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;I&#39;m a little confused by a couple things.  Were all people in both <br/>
groups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is technically in our<br/>
guild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along <br/>
Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The guild leader is the<br/>
Queen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters each. She was<br/>
playing the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king was playing his<br/>
warrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the <br/>
guild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. Our guild is<br/>
based on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully only a momentary<br/>
lapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>
considered this issue.]<br/>
<br/>
As to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king wrote that<br/>
primaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>
guildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of it. I guess the<br/>
mudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a fairly small<br/>
guild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot we&#39;ve had. I<br/>
really think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too insular.<br/>
The king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>
involved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with anyone else. We<br/>
tend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we have several dual<br/>
guilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you might say.<br/>
<br/>
As to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had friends quit with<br/>
decent level characters and so we took over the account in one case and<br/>
added the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We have a 3rd pc in<br/>
our office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to 3 lower level<br/>
characters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We play with our<br/>
friends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never any issue over<br/>
loot. We have a third generation of characters started and nearing their<br/>
20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s given us a<br/>
chance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>
everything at this point. I do think there are classes and places where<br/>
playing 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our friends have<br/>
gotten second accounts from friends or family members as well so now we have<br/>
an address book of account names and passwords so we can move people and<br/>
items at will. Imagine the surprise of our 40s ranger friend when he logs<br/>
back on Saturday to find he&#39;s wielding Yaks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments everyone, I wanted a reality check from some 3rd<br/>
parties and I appreciate the input.<br/>

Halana: we&#39;ve had the flu, and a 24 hr stomach bug both recently. Got to<br/>
love the daycare syndrome, we get every bug known to man. Fortunately my<br/>
daughter rarely gets sick herself.<br/>

Happy Valentine&#39;s Day!<br/>
