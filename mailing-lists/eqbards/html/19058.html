<div id="ygrps-yiv-297934786">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Spent a lot of time in Old Sebilis over the weekend.  Back to the Pyramid<br/>
and Crypt and Emperor&#39;s Tomb.  Among the stuff we hauled out was a<br/>
Journeyman&#39;s Walking Stick (although it looks like a mace rather than a<br/>
stick - go figure).  It&#39;s 1HB, 9 24, str, int & wis +4 and effect: Tashani.<br/>
Our group debated the worth of this thing and they mostly &quot;poo-poo&#39;d&quot; it<br/>
(since it was not &#39;uber&#39; wep.)  Well, I told them I would be happy to have<br/>
it - having neglected my 1HB since putting away the old Staff of Writhing 10<br/>
levels ago.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, here is the good part.  JWS in primary hand, weave Chant of Battle<br/>
(+dex) and Fufill&#39;s (-mr), the stick proc&#39;s nicely and the combind -mr<br/>
allows my Yk in my offhand to stick a proc on the Emperor!  Heh, the Yk has<br/>
some value again.  Nice to see a wep proc (Yeksha, since Tash is not<br/>
resisted usually) on a *red* mob (Emperor Chottal)!<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could switch JWS to offhand as soon as you see it proc (Tash is<br/>
a fairly long lasting effect) and get they Yak in the main hand so it procs<br/>
sooner and more often since its 75 DD each time it procs.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we did manage to down the Ancient Jarseth - he&#39;s a meanie.<br/>
Long melee for us (3 bards, chain & fear) after he killed our wizard (no one<br/>
had charm loaded nor could get him off the wiz quick enough.)<br/>
<br/>
We went into Chardok.  Met a level 51 at the zone.  He seemed to be bugged<br/>
(ie someone prior had pulled him to the zone and he was &#39;stuck&#39; there -<br/>
since we did not expect such a high level mob right there) but we killed<br/>
him.  The other zone patrollers and statics were not that bad (we had heard<br/>
horror storys.)  And we clear around to the zone out.  The monk pulling for<br/>
us brought some stuff from the first building. After we got the easy ones,<br/>
he began to complain about &quot;chain agro&quot; and was not able to bring out<br/>
singles.  Eventually, I think we zoned out after pulling a bit more than we<br/>
could handle (no enchanter was along and there were too many for me to do<br/>
effective crowd control.)  Another zone with nobody in it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, we were working our way out of Crypt in Old Seb when we encountered<br/>
what would normally be a 3 pull of krup froogs.  As the group talked about<br/>
what to do, I asked to try my lull (lament) and they said &#39;sure&#39; since we<br/>
had 2 enchanters and normally just pull all 3 and deal with it.  They were<br/>
rather amazed to see the lull work so well.  We might have been able to walk<br/>
past them with out agroing.  The first one pulled almost right on top of the<br/>
second lulled mob and he just sat there.  These are level 54 enchanters who<br/>
are not easily impressed - but Lament impressed them that time.<br/>
<br/>
And finally,  I spent some time cleaning out the bank account.  Decided to<br/>
go do the crafted armor quest with a griffon eye.  Bought 2 Fire Emeralds in<br/>
FV and teleported to NK.  Went to see the Centies and even made him tell me<br/>
about the quest.  But when I gave him the stuff, he gave me the &quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>
forgetting something&quot; for the eye (which I expected) and then nothing for<br/>
the gems.  Sheesh.  This is the 2nd time in a month that I have failed doing<br/>
crafted armor quest.  Other one was for crafted bp - lost the werewolf talon<br/>
and rubys. Grrrr.  Of course, I petitioned and was told &quot;sorry, can&#39;t<br/>
replace items... send email to ...&quot;  Anyone else know anything about the<br/>
crafted armor being bugged somehow?<br/>
