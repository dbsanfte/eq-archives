<div id="ygrps-yiv-617157485">Hmmm,  SK....<br/>
<br/>
Drunken footrace Lake Rathe to Stone Bridge?<br/>
<br/>
Drunken footrace from the treehouse to (well anywhere - heh - they wont<br/>
live)<br/>
<br/>
Duels in Valhlen&#39;s well - have to be underwater and fight<br/>
<br/>
Duels between Vahlen and Herman - take bets.<br/>
<br/>
Round up all the named old Paw Mobs and have them attempt to recapture their<br/>
home from the invader gnolls.  (Charm them and make them attack the other<br/>
gnolls).<br/>
<br/>
How many bodys can you fit into the treehouse?  Levitate off the main tree<br/>
and run to the empty one adjacent and see how many you can fit in it.<br/>
<br/>
Train to the Zone!  Have contest and see who can pull the largest train to<br/>
the LR zone in a set time.  Bards not allowed - since they can AE the whole<br/>
tree - well if they want to try they could I guess - heh.  Sow ppl, start 6<br/>
at a time, they have 3 minutes to gather and pull a train to LR zone.<br/>
Judges & audience can watch the incoming trains.<br/>
<br/>
Scavenger hunt for heads of the named old paw gnolls.  Might be impossible<br/>
to verify as they are no drops.<br/>
<br/>
Scavenger hunt for the highest bard song - kill herm, get page and flute, go<br/>
to cordelia get pg 2, go to vahlen get song, highest song wins.  Would be<br/>
interesting to really see whats in his loot load after he gives out a few<br/>
dozen songs.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, what day is this?  Maybe i should roll a bard and come join the fun.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] A Little Help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; k, this is completely off topic BUT I need your help.  My guild is<br/>
&gt; doing a joint guild event in South<br/>
&gt; Karana sometime in the near future (with 5 other guilds).  I, being a<br/>
&gt; fun loving party bard, have been<br/>
&gt; appointed to the &quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very<br/>
&gt; creative today and I&#39;m fresh out of<br/>
&gt; new and amusing ideas.  I want to<br/>
&gt; try to do something fun that isn&#39;t the same old same old.  I figure<br/>
&gt; the best place to go for some ideas<br/>
&gt; would be here!  The home of the fun loving, party enhancing,<br/>
&gt; entertaining bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for you ideas in advance :)<br/>
