<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623820749">Oh man, would this ever be hilarious.  Fact of the matter is you&#39;re correct,<br/>
Sylly.  By selling items on E-Bay, a real world valuation of virtual items<br/>
has been created.  In some states this would be enough to charge the person<br/>
with theft.  It gets worse by far though.  Because the theft took place<br/>
across state-lines, unless all parties involved live in California, there<br/>
are also several federal laws that would be violated.  Imagine the scene in<br/>
San Diego were the FBI to burst into Verant headquarters with warrants to<br/>
seize evidence in the form of computer log files, backup tapes, etc.  I<br/>
believe you&#39;re right Sylly, eventually someone will take real legal action<br/>
and actually bring something like this to trial somewhere.  The can of worms<br/>
this will open will likely shake the MMORPG worlds up pretty bad.  Every<br/>
time Verant fails to police this on their own, they accelerate the coming of<br/>
that fateful event.<br/>

I would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or has some bucks to<br/>
hire one go after these loot item stealers.  Subpoena Verant for the real<br/>
life name of the loot thief and file both criminal charges and civil suit.<br/>
That sot&#39;s local newspapers would have a field day with a story like that.<br/>
The thieves (and/or the farmer&#39;s) have established &quot;real - life&quot; value of<br/>
these items by selling them for cash on e-bay.  &quot;Your honor and esteemed<br/>
members of the jury, I beg your patience in this matter but I must show you<br/>
what grievous mental anguish my client would suffer if she were to have to<br/>
endure another Ykesha camp.  Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>
comfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the items stolen!  OMG!<br/>
Lord with a Sword!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only a matter of time before this will happen.</div>
