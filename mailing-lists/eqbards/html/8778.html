<b>Subject:</b> Pugius Dagger <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243120747">I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a friendly bard for only <br/>
25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its damage ratio is <br/>
just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>
increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?  It <br/>
looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>
ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so any <br/>
help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>
graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>
