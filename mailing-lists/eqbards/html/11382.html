<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606350951">A similar circumstance happened to a level 50 druid friend last night.  He <br/>
was in a group for Efreeti Boots, and the Efreeti popped and dropped them.  <br/>
It had been agreed before hand that only casters would roll for the boots, <br/>
and melee ppl would roll for the ring. Yet, when the rolls for the boots <br/>
started, a bard in the group also rolled, got one number better than my <br/>
friend,(who had the highest number up to that point) and promptly looted the <br/>
boots. My friend has been trying to get boots for weeks.  He was very upset.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I think this pretty much sums up my view on really special items, like<br/>
&gt;off Gods/Dragons. The other thing worth considering is, if you could<br/>
&gt;have (1) item, what would it be off a dragon? I&#39;m sure opinions vary,<br/>
&gt;but for my guild we generally shoot for everyone getting one dragon/god<br/>
&gt;drop before we start getting 2-3 for select people. I firmly agree with<br/>
&gt;this policy, and I was a recipient of a special drop 2 months ago in our<br/>
&gt;first victory over Lord Nagafen. I received Selo&#39;s Drums of the March.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve also had alot of other nifty things drop off other monsters since,<br/>
&gt;but there is no way I&#39;d pass up my drums for anything else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another thing to keep in mind, is who can best use an item. Part of the<br/>
&gt;problem, like Harmonic said, is that wizard who sees that Earthcrafter<br/>
&gt;is tradeable (druid staff recently fixed from +15 int [duh] to +15 wis,<br/>
&gt;common drop on Cazic Thule), and wants in the lotto so he can give it to<br/>
&gt;his L1 druid. umm, yuck. I really don&#39;t care if people twink other<br/>
&gt;characters with items they take their own time getting, but to my<br/>
&gt;knowledge, no one has solo&#39;d a god or dragon yet. ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On things like this belt, who could best use it would clearly be a<br/>
&gt;melee-intensive class, such as warrior, monk, or hybrid (I don&#39;t include<br/>
&gt;Bard because of our limited melee damage potential at higher levels [no<br/>
&gt;double attack]). Bards get a very minimal damage bonus from additional<br/>
&gt;strength, while an SK, PAL, WAR get several points for the same bonus.<br/>
&gt;Now, I don&#39;t want to stir up any controversy by saying that, that is<br/>
&gt;simply how I see it. Any caster being involved in that lotto is as<br/>
&gt;absurd as a druid wearing a FBSS and thinking he is a tank *laugh* (ask<br/>
&gt;the L50s how many druids they know with FBSS though *sigh*). (FBSS =<br/>
&gt;Flowing Black Silk Sash, effect: haste). Alot of the drops off<br/>
&gt;dragons/gods are either very class/race restrictive, or all/all. We also<br/>
&gt;need to kep in mind so many things are Bard usuable, just because we are<br/>
&gt;versatile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It takes a level of trust to handle loot such that the most appropriate<br/>
&gt;recipient gets it, it&#39;s one step up from what classes could reasonably<br/>
&gt;use it. If this was with groups from several guilds, or with people that<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t normally play together, for completeness I&#39;d say you should<br/>
&gt;include any class that could reasonably use the belt (so Bards should<br/>
&gt;have been in it too, but not finger wagglers, all/all be darned).<br/>
