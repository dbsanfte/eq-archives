<div id="ygrps-yiv-283425293">I have heard of a zombie skin quest from a member of my guild that raises<br/>
faction with them.   I do not know where it starts or the details, try<br/>
looking it up on the web.  You can also kill the heritics somewhere in Tox.<br/>
 It is a nice looking plate, too bad the dwarven ringmail tunic has better<br/>

&gt;I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I was hoping to do this quest but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;get my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in Erudin to get the<br/>
&gt;Guild master to give me the quest or any other quest for that matter.  I<br/>
&gt;used the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent but that is as<br/>
&gt;High as I can go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also looked to see if there were any other ways to raise my faction but<br/>
&gt;could only find the Odus Pearl quest which raises faction with the Knights.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, it is given by the same guy in the guild and needs a<br/>
&gt;container he gives you to complete it.  Again, he won&#39;t talk to me about any<br/>
&gt;quests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kitasi, you are the king of quests from what I hear, maybe you know what I<br/>
&gt;can do.  Or if, in fact it is a lost cause.  Anyone who has any info can<br/>
&gt;share, not just Kit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
