<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825733763">I went to New York on business for two weeks.  Within an hour of getting<br/>
into EQ again, my guild gave me a small gift:  a red scale and a white<br/>
scale.  So I managed to finish my Epic Saturday afternoon!  Getting the<br/>
white scale last means you make three trade-ins in a row; pretty<br/>
nervewracking if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
I knew we had some red scales in our vault.  My guild leader traded a<br/>
Velious haste cloak for the white scale.  I have no idea where he found<br/>
one; I had assumed that every white scale on Innoruuk had been sucked up<br/>
already.  He wasn&#39;t on to say.  I doubt it was from Gorenaire, since the<br/>
only guilds capable of killing Gorenaire have Bards who still need them,<br/>
and I&#39;ve heard nothing about the Scalegiver dropping whites.  Maybe a<br/>
pickup Vox raid.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s very cool.  As a mostly melee Bard (blasphemy to some of<br/>
you, I know), this is a big improvement right across the board.  And I<br/>
actually managed to raise Brass Instruments twice today singing a Brass<br/>
song in combat!<br/>

3.5 blue bubbles in 5 hours in Sebilis.  We rocked.<br/>
