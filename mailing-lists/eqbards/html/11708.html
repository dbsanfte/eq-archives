<div id="ygrps-yiv-709748397">that cleric of yours is a must.  if one of your group is an enchanter, you<br/>
should be good.  that way you can fight the ghoul lord alone while his 2<br/>
guards are out of the fight.  if you do not have an enchanter, i would<br/>
suggest that you pixie strike one of the guards while everyone else takes<br/>
out the lord.  it would be quite difficult, but you could try messing both<br/>
guards, if you can get it to stick.  may as well have dirge up, it&#39;s only<br/>
300+ dmg but it enabled my very unbalanced group (i.e. we should not have<br/>
tried it hehe) to kill the lord once.  we all died, but we got the sword<br/>
first =)  the key is to stagger the spawn.  keep the guard you are on messed<br/>
for a couple minutes after the initial fight, if you all survive.  most of<br/>
your group should be 45+, not 40+.  the lord is 48ish and his guards are<br/>
45ish, give or take.  good luck.<br/>

&gt; 	Hello all, I have been reading the list for about 2 <br/>
&gt; months now and I<br/>
&gt; am very impressed with the collection of knowledge here. My <br/>
&gt; friends and I on<br/>
&gt; Tribunal server have just joined the 40+ club and are looking for<br/>
&gt; information on camping the SSOY (Ykesha). I am a 46th lvl Bard and my<br/>
&gt; friends are all 40+ including a 50th cleric. We are all <br/>
&gt; looking around for<br/>
&gt; any information regarding this camp and if anyone might share <br/>
&gt; some tips<br/>
&gt; and/or advice it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
