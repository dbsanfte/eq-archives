&gt; to paddle around in the water for 20 min or so,<br/>
&gt; checking my loc all the while so that I can attempt<br/>
&gt; climbing onto one of those tall shuttles.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the patience and I am not that brave...there is a<br/>
&gt; lvl 50 or thereabouts mob that swims near the teleport<br/>
&gt; pots for the evil races....I wasn&#39;t willing to wait<br/>
&gt; around to see if it ranges far or has a cousin the<br/>
