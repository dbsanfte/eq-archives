<b>Subject:</b> Re: Undead drops in Kithicor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286966647">I went thru kithicor today and ... no more undead.<br/>
<br/>
As for what they dropped yesterday, the NORMAL undead spawns dropped<br/>
&quot;Tainted&quot; weapons of all varieties, (1hs, 2hs, piercing, 1hb, 2hb) the<br/>
only one I heard stats on was:<br/>
<br/>
Tainted Rapier, Piercing,  Dam 19 delay 5,several +5 stat bonuses and<br/>
-5sv disease.<br/>
<br/>
All the weapons were no-drop, and I didn&#39;t get a chance at any of them.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
