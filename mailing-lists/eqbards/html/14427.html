<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581826251">This (assuming you are all not conspiring to fool my lvl 18 mind) is<br/>
another piece of evidence that they do absolutly NO testing on some<br/>
things.  This, your worshipfullness, is what some of us complain about. <br/>
(Sorry couldn&#39;t resist).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I still don&#39;t get it.  I have now gotten 12 emails from non-bard friends<br/>
&gt; asking me if the &quot;See Invisible&quot; enhancement is the only one not working or<br/>
&gt; if we got totally screwed again.  It still raises the same question for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How in earth, Heaven, and Hell can they possibly defend the position that<br/>
&gt; they test changes when they put in something like this and it is patently<br/>
&gt; obvious it does not work!  30 seconds of testing maximum and its apparent to<br/>
&gt; anyone with more visual acuity than the aforementioned Stevie Wonder that it<br/>
&gt; does not friggin&#39; work!<br/>
