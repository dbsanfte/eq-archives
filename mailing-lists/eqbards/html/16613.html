<div id="ygrps-yiv-646182574">Looking for fun and adventure at level 35 on Veeshan....<br/>
Please don&#39;t say Guk.  I can walk from live side tower to dead side tower and not run into a single NPC in lower guk on veeshan.  The server is THAT crowded.  Almost 50%+ of the players are 35+ now (server REALLY needs to be split).  Soldung B is the same.  Asside from doing FG&#39;s or Efreet with my guild there&#39;s no point in even visiting those two dungeons unless I&#39;m after a specific item.  (No problem getting in a group, but XP is another question entirely).<br/>
<br/>
I hunted in Kithicor last night, that was fun.  I&#39;d LOVE to get a group together to do PAW but I rarely have time to get into an organized group.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, advice welcome.  I made it to 50 on Test BEFORE there was ever more than 300 people online at a time.  Test was pristine back then.  On Veeshan I have a hard time levelling just because I can&#39;t find anything to kill.  Everything is camped to high heaven.  Even giants are hard to find these days.<br/>
<br/>
Ungh!<br/>
<br/>
1800-2200 players online.  60-70% are hunting the high level areas.... **sighs**<br/>
<br/>
And people wonder why I spend most of my time in Asheron&#39;s Call now.<br/>
