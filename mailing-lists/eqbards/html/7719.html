There are multiple &quot;gradients&quot; classes are placed on, not just one.<br/>
<br/>
Examples: <br/>
   Ability to do damage, <br/>
   Ability to absorb dmg,<br/>
   Number/versatility of weapons usable, <br/>
   Number/versatility of spells usable, <br/>
   Specialized &lt;--&gt; General use, and, of course,<br/>
   Ease in Roleplaying ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It is impossible, at least for me, to combine all these factors into a<br/>
single scale. Some classes, such as bards, can use good spells, melee,<br/>
absorb damage, and RP well. (lv50s: At some levels, I *know*) Others, such<br/>
as enchanters, are more specialized.   //<br/>
