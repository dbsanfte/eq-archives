<div id="ygrps-yiv-577790356">The orb is the mystery to me.  Its a great item, but only for classes<br/>
that can&#39;t really use it.<br/>
<br/>
How many int casters are willing to trade a lot (Stein of Mogguk is<br/>
cheaper) of mana for the ac/hp?  As I said maybe necros and mages who<br/>
solo a lot (I know my mage wasn;t very concerned with his total mana,<br/>
since he had more than enough to cast away anything he could solo).  <br/>
<br/>
Bards have dual wield before they can afford the item (twinks a side, I<br/>
gues sit has value to a twink).  And since you can&#39;t hold an instrument<br/>
with it, its pretty much worthless to them.<br/>
<br/>
In any case we camped the scryer for 4 hours and got two of them (along<br/>
with 3/4 braceltes we wanted for our wizard and necro), so I am happy<br/>
about their value.  We are going to sell them and use the money to buy<br/>
the jewels we need for some class armor for our bard and myself... <br/>
(since we haven&#39;t gotten much equipment lately)<br/>
