<div id="ygrps-yiv-960493391">Crier don&#39;t leave.  I appologise for even debating the issue with Harmonic.<br/>
While his statement was out of line, I should have just given up talking<br/>
sense to him once I realized he refused to listen to reason, or to have a<br/>
sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us are pretty level headed and are always willing to offer advice.<br/>
Some bad, some good.  I will agree that John Kim seems to have the best<br/>
technical advice on being a bard I&#39;ve ever seen (John, you amaze me).  All<br/>
of us have valid points to make and I agree, this list helps even the best<br/>
of bards be a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
Stick around, the fun never ends ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I cannot emphasize enough how much this list has meant to me in the last<br/>
few<br/>
&gt; months.  The constructive discussions and John Kim&#39;s thorough testing have<br/>
&gt; made the difficult job of being a bard in EverQuest less difficult.<br/>
&gt; However, I do believe that I will take my leave of it for a while, at<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; until the expansion comes out.  I simply don&#39;t need the kind of bile<br/>
quoted<br/>
&gt; below in my inbox on Monday morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Harmonic, you&#39;re rude.  Many of your posts are condescending and arrogant<br/>
&gt; and you damage the signal to noise ratio of the list in my opinion.  You<br/>
&gt; make personal attacks such as &quot;You forgot to take your medicine today.&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you call other players (myself included) fools and worse for having<br/>
opinions<br/>
&gt; that differ from yours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your opinion regarding all-caps being used to highlight a word in a<br/>
sentence<br/>
&gt; is WELL known.  It does not, however, reflect general Internet usage.  The<br/>
&gt; majority of the Internet is not likely to bend itself to your will, so<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably in your best interest to attempt to overcome your prejudice of<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; particular nuance of written Internet communications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, thanks to all of the posters (Harmonic included) on this list that<br/>
&gt; have contributed to my understanding of being a bard in EverQuest.  I hope<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ve given some insights as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See you in Kunark.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the<br/>
equivalent<br/>
&gt; &gt;   of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>
&gt; &gt;   escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>
&gt; &gt;   come from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jhenders@...">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>
&gt; &gt;   proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>
&gt; &gt;   voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the composure they do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And no, I don&#39;t have to prove everyone wrong.  Just those who post<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions as if they were the only one possible.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Who said my opinion was the only possible one?  Man, you need to stop<br/>
&gt; &gt;   reading into these posts.  So far you&#39;ve done it several times, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   John(tm) even had to make a comment on it.  You forgot to take your<br/>
&gt; &gt;   medicine today.  How about not jumping all over people on the list?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Since you&#39;ve been here, you&#39;ve done nothing but argue unproductively.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   If you&#39;ve played since Beta 2, we are happy for you, others here have<br/>
&gt; &gt;   as well.  You flaunt your knowledge as if you designed the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Senior Guide on whatever server or not, I would just chill out and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   try to be helpful.  We don&#39;t need any more smartasses =)<br/>
