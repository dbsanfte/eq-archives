a while, around lvl 10 or so, I ran around SK, Rathe<br/>
Mountains, and EK, auctioning &quot;buying black pearls&quot;. I<br/>
would buy them at the site of the kill, and sell them<br/>
for 100pp apiece to jewelers I knew. Made a few<br/>
hundred plat that way, incredible cash at lvl 10. BTW,<br/>
100pp is the going rate for pearls on Innoruuk,<br/>
someone said they were 200 on some servers? The druids<br/>
also drop them, as do the named centaurs in SK. (I<br/>
won&#39;t hunt quest NPC&#39;s, but others do.)<br/>
