<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013634669">I think someone on the list said that they don&#39;t work as wind instruments.<br/>
It was a couple of weeks ago, so I don&#39;t remember for sure. :(<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] Scorpion Stingers<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I logged in with my newbie Iksar Monk (Level 3) and was <br/>
&gt; killing scorpions in the Field of Bone.  I killed 4 Scorpions (blue <br/>
&gt; con) and got two Stingers (wind instruments).  I am mentioning this <br/>
&gt; because I haven&#39;t heard anyone bring up the FoB scorpions, but I have <br/>
&gt; heard people talking about the scorpions in Overthere.  Someone was <br/>
&gt; asking about instruments in Kunark.  I was thinking that for those <br/>
&gt; bards playing in Kunark a lot.  This is probably a good place to <br/>
&gt; stock up on *flutes*.  Just offer some money to newbie Iksars to <br/>
&gt; bring you some.  I also haven&#39;t explored too much of this zone, but I <br/>
&gt; bet that there are more scorpions scattered about and probably real <br/>
&gt; easy to stock up on these.  Just thought I would mention this bit of <br/>
&gt; info ;)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I usually have tons of mino horns in the bank for corpse recovery and <br/>
&gt; I tend to destroy them once I am back to my corpse and collecting <br/>
&gt; lots of loot.<br/>
