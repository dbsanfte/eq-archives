 </span></blockquote> Yes, but in the context of why I wouldn&#39;t be satisfied doing merely that if<br/>
there was a more difficult option.  Doesn&#39;t mean that guy hitting his few<br/>
buttons couldn&#39;t do what I do, just that he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
My main point is.  Bards can do more different things than any other class,<br/>
not more of any one thing than any other class.  This versatility does not<br/>
translate into greater power.  In this game being powerful means being more<br/>
able to gain xp, pp, items.  Bards can help set groups gain these things<br/>
faster, but in most if not all of these cases there is another class that<br/>
could help them gain these things even faster.  I would argue this is true<br/>
in all cases except with manasong.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of the things bards can do are flashy, subtle, intriguing, and<br/>
pretty cool.  But powerful?  not really.  DDD is even more useless than<br/>
most.  John Kim has already presented multiple examples of how a shaman can<br/>
keep an entire party of melee characters more enhanced than a bard can<br/>
indefinitely.  Clearly any other melee class can provide better offensive<br/>
weapon and tanking support than we can.  Clearly any druid or necro can do<br/>
more DoT damage than we can, effectively indefinitely.  Clearly an enchanter<br/>
can CC far more effectively than we can.  Our sole advantage is our ability<br/>
to do some of all these things.  I just disagree that the advantage<br/>
outweighs the weakness of doing all of them individually so much more poorly<br/>
than the primary users can.</div>
