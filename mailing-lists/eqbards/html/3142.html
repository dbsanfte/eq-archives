&gt; So either we go along with you or continue to use different words.<br/>

&gt; I had hoped we could perhaps come to agreement on this topic.  If we have a<br/>
&gt; groundswell for &quot;juggling&quot; I&#39;ll concede, in the interest of picking one word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than being used to it, do you have a reason to prefer &quot;juggling&quot; over<br/>
&gt; &quot;weaving?&quot;  I&#39;d really rather be persuaded by compelling argument instead<br/>
&gt; of ultimatum.<br/>

<br/>
The main reason I call it juggling is that that&#39;s what it feels like I&#39;m doing,<br/>
clicking buttons left and right, trying to keep all the effects happening.<br/>
Weaving sounds like too placid a term for such a hectic activity.  :)<br/>
