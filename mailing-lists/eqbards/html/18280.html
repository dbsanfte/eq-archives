<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382977311">No actually the reason I started singing GR was because COB wasn&#39;t doing<br/>
anything.  I was getting annoyed because I could get only one song<br/>
(hymm) to do anything.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t holding  up my end of the<br/>
bargain.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to repeat the troubles last night (to check some other songs)<br/>
but I never grouped with an enchanter...<br/>

&gt; You mentioned you were singing Guardian Rhythms at one point, for the AC<br/>
&gt; buff.  Were you having issues with COB stacking only while GR was in the<br/>
&gt; twist?  Since both have an AC component, I&#39;m speculating they won&#39;t stack<br/>
&gt; with each other.  I&#39;m never tried that particular twist, so, as I said, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; only speculating.<br/>
