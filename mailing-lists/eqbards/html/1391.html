&gt; Interesting, am I the only one who twists warsong and Anthem?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just experimented with this last night, after twisting them<br/>
together for the past couple of weeks.  I used a combine long sword<br/>
(28 delay) and swung 20 times (after the very first swing which<br/>
counted as 0) and ran each test twice.<br/>
<br/>
- With no songs going, 20 swings took 56 seconds, which confirms what<br/>
someone said earlier about the delay representing tenths of seconds<br/>
of delay.<br/>
<br/>
- With Anthem as my only song, 20 swings took 51 seconds, or<br/>
aproximately a 10% decrease in delay.<br/>
<br/>
- With just Whistling Warsong going, 20 swings took 48 seconds, or<br/>
aproximately a 15% decrease in delay.<br/>
<br/>
- With both Anthem and Warsong going, 20 swings still took 48<br/>
seconds, indicating they do not stack in terms of cutting down on<br/>
your delay any further.  You do still get a STR boost from each song.<br/>
<br/>
Based on this, I&#39;m now no longer going to bother stacking both songs,<br/>
and when solo I&#39;ll likely twist Warsong with Bellow and Healing.  In<br/>
groups I&#39;ll do Anthem instead of Warsong.  I am going to test this<br/>
one more time on a weapon with a greater delay just to be 100% sure.<br/>
