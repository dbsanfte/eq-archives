&gt; This Amulet of Order is a fairly good artifact to have!  A few AC, +5<br/>
&gt; Charisma, and it acts like a lightstone!  I&#39;ve been debating whether or not<br/>
&gt; to discard my spiked collar for it (+3 strength) but I&#39;m thinking with<br/>

<br/>
- It is a quest item.  It will not go in the bank, and you<br/>
can&#39;t give it to anyone.  If you&#39;re planning on using this<br/>
some of the time (to get better prices when buying stuff), and<br/>
planning to use real neck armor otherwise, you&#39;ll have to<br/>
carry it in your inventory all the time.  It only weighs 0.1<br/>
or 0.2 lbs though.<br/>
<br/>
- It boosted my charisma to 115.  I got charged the same<br/>
prices as I did when I was at 110 charisma.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
broken, maybe there&#39;s a cap on the price benefits for charisma<br/>
at 110, maybe it only helps with really expensive items.<br/>
<br/>
- It is AC 2, which is not bad so it might be a good item to<br/>
have if we can verify any of the charisma effects that we&#39;ve<br/>
speculated about.<br/>
