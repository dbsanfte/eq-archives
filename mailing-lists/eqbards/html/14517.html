&gt; Just so you know, the RPG I played most (and type of system I<br/>
&gt; like the most) was Traveller.  Yes, one good stick in the gut<br/>
&gt; could disable just about anyone.  Yes Muhammad Ali could be<br/>
&gt; knocked out by one weakling swinging a pipe at his head from<br/>
&gt; behind.  Yes it changes combat tactics - rather than what you<br/>
&gt; do in a fight being important (which I always thought should<br/>
&gt; be based on the character&#39;s skill, not the player&#39;s ability to<br/>
&gt; play), how you plan a fight and how well you carry out that<br/>
&gt; plan, and how you adapt to changing circumstances becomes<br/>
&gt; important.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This does happen to a certain extent in EQ. The opposite extreme of what you<br/>
state would be a game like Street Fighter, which is totally dependent on the<br/>
player&#39;s skill to orchestrate tactical moves/combos.<br/>
<br/>
The flip side to that is a lot like what I&#39;ve read in Rainbow Six by Tom<br/>
Clancy which deals with commando&#39;s vs terrorists. There&#39;s a situation. You<br/>
set up a plan and each person has a task/job. You adapt to the circumstances<br/>
in an environment full with lethal combat results.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a MUD with this latter profile, I can&#39;t imagine getting pickup<br/>
groups together as it really would take excellent team coordination, and<br/>
it&#39;d probably be best to have voice communications.<br/>

&gt; - I don&#39;t like level based systems<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMHO, all of these are quick-and-easy approaches to &quot;solving&quot;<br/>
&gt; the playbalance problem by artificially imposing limitations<br/>
&gt; to enforce orthogonality (balancing a game is much easier if<br/>
&gt; the factors you can tweak are all orthogonal).  The tradeoff<br/>
&gt; of course is that you lose flexibility and diversity, and you<br/>
&gt; get some really strange things happening in the game world<br/>
&gt; physics (e.g. high level people without safe fall surviving<br/>
&gt; impossible drops).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the reminder. I&#39;ve played in some fun Traveller games but it was<br/>
a very long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the reward of enhancing or tweaking a character&#39;s abilitites as they<br/>
progress and acquire wealth and equipment. At least we don&#39;t earn exp for<br/>
gold. <br/>
<br/>
In truth, the RPG I enjoyed most was the James Bond game by Victory Games<br/>
which featured &quot;hero points&quot; which allowed you to perform the standard<br/>
impossible James Bond stuff, and allowed you to progress from rookie agent<br/>
to double-O (but of course). It wasn&#39;t the most realistic of combat systems,<br/>
but was definitely quicker and easier than, say AD&D, without being as<br/>
ludicrous as Top Secret.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, I think that Everquest does have a nice balance of fun vs realism.<br/>
<br/>
But to show where Brad stands on realism in this game:<br/>
He was on the general Chat line in EQ during a server crash and I asked him<br/>
about having equipment break so that things would need to be replace. I<br/>
figured this would make the game a bit more realistic and would give my<br/>
blacksmithing skills something to do. His reply was, &quot;Entropy Sucks!&quot; :-)<br/>
