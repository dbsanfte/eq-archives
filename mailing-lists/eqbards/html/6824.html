<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437638930">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
Lullabye, is a great song.  I always keep it memorized.  This song is a<br/>
lifesaver.  I use this song when someone in the party has pulled too many.<br/>
The basic idea is that when you realize that there are more foe&#39;s that the<br/>
party can endure, whip out the lute and play the song.  The rest of the<br/>
party MUST concentrate on one single target at a time untill it is dead.  It<br/>
is a joyous (and scary) feeling to see a group of 5 nasty blues all nodding<br/>
off while you strum.  Start and stop the song as soon as you see the &quot;so and<br/>
so nods&quot; message.  With the lute the song is much tougher for monsters to<br/>
resist.<br/>
<br/>
Now here is how you can get killed really quickly with the song :)<br/>
<br/>
If all of the foe&#39;s are /con yellow or higher.  Running would probably be<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
If the party your in just dosent get it, or if you havent explained it to<br/>
them during between battle downtime.<br/>
<br/>
If the party REALLY dosent get it and all runs while you stand there, the<br/>
center of attention.<br/>
<br/>
If the party dosent use /assist to all target one Foe.  Everytime they get<br/>
hit it wakes them up, and they will hit YOU, not the one who woke them up.<br/>
<br/>
I think that you might be able to use this song while soloing, if you were<br/>
to use the singing skill, and fight one at a time with weapons.  This might<br/>
be better as a defensive tactic than a offensive tactic though.  Getting<br/>
ganged a mob of Greens, comes to mind, cause they would be less likely to<br/>
resist.  Or you could always Bravely run away with Selo&#39;s.<br/>

Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first posting to the list and I was hoping by coming out of lurk<br/>
mode I might get some help from some of the elder bards here. I recently<br/>
attained my 15th level and ran to the bards guild in Kelethin to get<br/>
Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye.  I went to www.harpers.net and took a look at the<br/>
writeup for this song. I am not sure of the proper usage for this song. How<br/>
should I use it say if I were approaching a dervish camp (like the one in<br/>
Oasis) with my group as opposed to using it in Unrest?  I did approach a few<br/>
bards who were over level 17 asking how exactly they used the song and I was<br/>
told on 2 occasions that they had gotten into more trouble than it was worth<br/>
with this song and not to use it.  After lurking on this list for the last<br/>
couple of weeks it seems that there are plenty of you out there who know how<br/>
to make this song work to your advantage and I&#39;d like to know how I should<br/>
approach this song.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any help you can give me. I am very very happy<br/>
playing my bard and can&#39;t see myself playing any other character. But then<br/>
again, maybe I&#39;m just a wood elf in human&#39;s clothing =)<br/>
