<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493509732">Although this formlua may be max damage at low levels when you get to the 20s or<br/>
higher you can throw it out the window, although as you pointed out str does<br/>
play a part.<br/>
<br/>
Very often now by thulian blood claw hits for 14. It is a DMG 5 weapon. My<br/>
Dragoon Dirk (DMG 6 weapon) in my off-hand hits for 15 often, but never 16. this<br/>
is regardless of whether I fight at my present modified strength of 99, or<br/>
whether it goes much higher with anthem. It may be an imparted strength bonus,<br/>
as you will notice putting on a strength item increases your attack factor, or<br/>
it may be as a result of issue. My damage did not go up when I hit 20th, but it<br/>
did a bit later. I started noticing these higher damages in the middle of L30.<br/>
So was it L30, or was it the 2 Jagged Bands I swapped for my former 2 +2 str<br/>
rings? I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;ll try a high cgreen con without the rings or<br/>
something and let you know. The bottom line is that 2xDMG+1 does seem very<br/>
accurate at lower levels, but not higher.<br/>
