<b>Subject:</b> RE: Fw: [EQ-Rangers] Dueling a Bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-485649171">bards are great against casters, poor against melee.  i win almost all of my<br/>
duels against casters, but have not won against melee yet.  i try not to<br/>
employ tactics such as kiting or fear/chain in duels, just to be more<br/>
challenging.  i fought 2 level 50 rangers 3 times.  the 1st ranger times i<br/>
got him to about 35-40% health both times and died, once with weapons and<br/>
once with lute only.  the 2nd ranger i got to 21hp with lute only, have not<br/>
tried her with weapons and different song strategies.  i wanna try again.<br/>
btw, my favorite part of any duel is dirge.  love that 325 nuke to change<br/>
the tide of the fight.<br/>

&gt; Sounds like Mr. Ranger here relies on a few techniques, <br/>
&gt; mainly his bow -<br/>
&gt; and doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s fair he might have to rethink his stragtegy and<br/>
&gt; tactics. </span></blockquote></div>
