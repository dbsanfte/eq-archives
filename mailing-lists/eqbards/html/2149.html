&gt; &lt;.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why?  When grouping with others it disrupts two of their most often used<br/>
&gt; spells?  I would think the opposite would be true.  Granted, I can always<br/>
&gt; get a SoW from someone in the group, but why let them waste the mana when<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s is faster (at least for me)?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think he&#39;s referring to the Selos dispells root bug, which is a *huge*<br/>
lifesafer for all in<br/>
my party. Ever been rooted in Unrest inches from the zone line while a carrion<br/>
ghoul and<br/>
his buddies beat you to death?  I know I haven&#39;t, but its happened to my druid<br/>
friends<br/>
when we&#39;re not grouped.  I&#39;d scream bloody murder if they made Selos unable to<br/>
dispell<br/>
root.  (Especially since I&#39;m mostly playing on Rallos Zek these days - All those<br/>
naked<br/>
mages out for my blood, and no way to escape! :)<br/>
