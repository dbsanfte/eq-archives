charisma didn&#39;t affect the test because the mobs were so low<br/>
level that my chance to nod them was already maxed (the amount<br/>
that it&#39;s maxed at is bugged, but I believe I was at the max<br/>
nevertheless).  From subjective experience trying to do crowd<br/>
control against blue to red mobs, I do believe charisma makes<br/>
a difference.<br/>

I just phrased it the way I did in my post because I want<br/>
Verant to take the initiative in giving us an explanation.<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to give them the above freebie if it in fact is<br/>
not what&#39;s going on, and they just wanted to give us a BS<br/>
