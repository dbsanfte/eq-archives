<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831379496">Ummm, the sirens in OOT look an awful lot like mermaids, which would not be<br/>
a good thing to meet just swimming around S Qeynos I would think.<br/>

I too swear I saw a mermaid while swimming in South Qeynos waiting for the<br/>
boat. It was certainly not a shark. Yet when I swam to where it was, there<br/>
was nothing there (I was to dumb or dumbfounded to /con it). I have asked<br/>
many if they had seen one, but people kept saying that there are none in the<br/>
game. While I have yet to go all &quot;Ahab&quot; and devote my life to hunting one<br/>
down, it is nice to hear I am not alone in this rare sighting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone ever swam to the bottom of the lake in West Commonlands? I<br/>
swam to the bottom and was teleported to the zone wall it shares with East<br/>
Commonlands. The text sayed that I was being moved to a safe place or<br/>
something like that. It has happened repeatedly and I swear that I saw<br/>
something down there too, though, alas I do not recall the /loc of the<br/>
object.<br/>
<br/>
This list is a wonderful source of information, but it took another mermaid<br/>
sighting to get me to leave Lurkerville.<br/>
