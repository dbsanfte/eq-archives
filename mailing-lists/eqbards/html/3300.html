<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410950486">Not to add my voice to the list of siriens offering<br/>
you roleplaying only to dash you along the rocks,<br/>
inches away from an angry cyclops, but I&#39;m a member of<br/>
the Avengers Federation on Erollosi Marr.  I&#39;m the<br/>
official loresinger for the guild.  We have a great<br/>
web page and message board, and our guild meetings are<br/>
usually punctuated with drinking and revelrie, and<br/>
always end with exchanging gifts, where the younger<br/>
give away a pp or 2 they may have earned, and some of<br/>
the older ones giving away full sets of ringmail or<br/>
special weapons.  Our guildsay is constantly active<br/>
with people helping each other out.  One of our nobles<br/>
is only level 4 but a great role player.  Check out<br/>
our website. Look for the stories from Llewrend.  The<br/>
