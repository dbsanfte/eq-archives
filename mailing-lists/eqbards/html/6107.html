&gt; &gt; If there were no casters involved I would switch to button<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you were doing most of the tanking, then Warsong probably<br/>
&gt; was appropriate.  If the others are taking damage though, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; consider using GR instead of Warsong.  It has a slight AC buff<br/>
&gt; (bigger than ER or PR) which is mostly negligible, but can<br/>
&gt; make a difference in marginal situations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Almost forgot.  If the others were taking damage, you should<br/>
probably use Chant of Battle instead of Anthem.  With casters<br/>
tanking, the attack speedup of Anthem is laughable.  Chant<br/>
without a drum buffs str by half the amount of Anthem, but it<br/>
also increases dex and AC.  If you&#39;re using a drum then it&#39;s<br/>
no contest - Chant will increase str by the same amount as<br/>
Anthem, and dex by the same amount as str (Anthem does not<br/>
boost dex), and gives double the AC as without a drum.<br/>
