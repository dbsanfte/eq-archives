<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221703671">Since we are throwing the topic around, how about the following idea for a<br/>
new song:<br/>
<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Notes of Indifference<br/>
Level: One of our missing songs<br/>
Instrument: Wind<br/>
Target: AE <br/>
Effect: When sung, makes all mobs in the zone indifferent to you.  Mobs that<br/>
you are normally KOS to ignore you instead.  Effect goes away if you attack<br/>
the mob.  Undead are not affected by the song.  When played with an<br/>
instrument, makes the effect party wide.  Mobs get a resist check every<br/>
pulse while you are within their sight/aggro radius.      <br/>
Analysis:  Primary benefit is that it allows the bard to get bound in evil<br/>
cities without fear of getting attacked.  Also allows the bard/group to<br/>
travel deep into dungeons bypassing mobs along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
Making it a party effect is probably asking for too much.  A legitimate<br/>
possibility though if it affects the bard only.<br/>
