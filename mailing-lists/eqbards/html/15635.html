<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-717415631">I think they simply have not spent the time making a drum that looks like a<br/>
drum yet, hopefully this will be addressed with the expansion.  Not to be a<br/>
pessimist but I kind of think that when the drum graphic does go in it will<br/>
probably end up looking a little awkward and strange, like when you have a<br/>
sack on the end of your arm (remember the old mino horn) but what the heck.<br/>
If they could just figure out a way to make the attach point for the drum be<br/>
the belt buckle of the character image and put skinny drumsticks in each<br/>
hand it might work well using the current animation...like the little<br/>
drummer bard - pa rum pum pum pum pum.<br/>

&gt; If that were the case how did the new high level weapon <br/>
&gt; graphics, which are<br/>
&gt; surely also in the same file get used?  If you take what they <br/>
&gt; said about<br/>
&gt; this at their word, then they had to update the file for <br/>
&gt; everyone to do the<br/>
&gt; weapon graphics and either were too lazy to do it for shields <br/>
&gt; and drums, or<br/>
&gt; they shields and drums really are not in there and won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; currently fit.<br/>

&gt; My understanding our drum graphic suffers from the same <br/>
&gt; problem as the male<br/>
&gt; barbarian shield graphic.  It is there but not referenced.  <br/>
&gt; Brad said a<br/>
&gt; while back it is a huge file that needs to be updated. So the <br/>
&gt; expansion<br/>
&gt; should take care of this issue (if you have the expansion <br/>
&gt; client that is).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; huh?<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t they just have separate exe&#39;s one with the expansion <br/>
&gt; having textures<br/>
&gt; pointing to flash new graphics and the old one with the <br/>
&gt; textures pointing to<br/>
&gt; old rusty swords. That&#39;d be a laugh when someone says look at <br/>
&gt; my brand new<br/>
&gt; sword doesn&#39;t it look cool, someone who hasn&#39;t the expansion <br/>
&gt; looks and goes<br/>
&gt; hey its a rusty dagger :)<br/>
&gt; Anyway that&#39;s what I&#39;d do, but then I&#39;m not verant &gt;_&lt;<br/>

&gt; The below post from Abashi sure makes it sound like we won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; be getting our<br/>
&gt; drum visual fixed even in the expansion.  Also, if they said <br/>
&gt; before they<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t add it because of memory limitations, are they going <br/>
&gt; to have to<br/>
&gt; delete some things to add in the Iskar textures? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Kit<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though the system requirements will be increased for the expansion, EQ<br/>
&gt; proper must continue to work for the originally published <br/>
&gt; specifcations. As<br/>
&gt; such, we&#39;ll have to see how much texture memory we have left <br/>
&gt; after adding<br/>
&gt; the Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much <br/>
&gt; individuality can<br/>
&gt; be added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must <br/>
&gt; exist in all<br/>
&gt; zones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common <br/>
&gt; denominator of the<br/>
&gt; old EQ system requirements. <br/>
&gt; Now, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will <br/>
&gt; have more varied<br/>
&gt; and complex textures than you see in the world now. This is <br/>
&gt; possible because<br/>
&gt; those items can only be viewed by people who bought the <br/>
&gt; expansion thereby<br/>
&gt; agreeing to the new system requirements. <br/>
