<div id="ygrps-yiv-247316424">Uh you can wait safely on the island outpost while you wait for the shuttle<br/>
to come to the dock.  The shuttles stop at the dock there and then go back<br/>
to the big ship.  True, the ship is headed to the BB shuttles at that point,<br/>
but at least you will be on it and can just wait for it to complete the<br/>
circle.  No hanging around in water is required, there are even two taverns<br/>
on the island.<br/>

To me, a shuttle is a boat.  I am also quite reluctent<br/>
to paddle around in the water for 20 min or so,<br/>
checking my loc all the while so that I can attempt<br/>
climbing onto one of those tall shuttles.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have the patience and I am not that brave...there is a<br/>
lvl 50 or thereabouts mob that swims near the teleport<br/>
pots for the evil races....I wasn&#39;t willing to wait<br/>
around to see if it ranges far or has a cousin the<br/>
lives to the North;-)<br/>
