<div id="ygrps-yiv-324202220">I honestly believe that using a wind instrument with charm does nothing<br/>
significant.  I&#39;ve done many charms, with and without the flute, and I saw<br/>
no noticeable difference in number of resists and/or duration of charm.<br/>
Granted, it wasn&#39;t a &quot;scientific&quot; study, but I didn&#39;t see anything to<br/>
warrant such tests.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m wrong (which is more often than not).<br/>

&gt; Hmm, I just went and looked at the song listing there and <br/>
&gt; thought hmm, it<br/>
&gt; might be interesting to see all of our songs sorted by the <br/>
&gt; instrument that<br/>
&gt; enhances them - so I cut and pasted into excel and got a sorted list.<br/>
&gt; Looking it over I notice that both charm and mez are listed <br/>
&gt; as enhanced by<br/>
&gt; wind instruments!  Wow - is that right?  I mean do they show <br/>
&gt; significant<br/>
&gt; benefit when played with a wind instrument?  That could <br/>
&gt; explain why they<br/>
&gt; seemed so very weak to me.  Ie my charms were very short, <br/>
&gt; etc. Something to<br/>
&gt; try tonight Look out Choon and Froon here I come and I got my <br/>
&gt; mino horn in a<br/>
&gt; little bag around my wrist!!!<br/>
