<div id="ygrps-yiv-287810721">The level 14 song DOES have a purpose.  With many lore items, and even a few<br/>
non-lore items you receive a message about the item.  For instance, one ogre<br/>
I happened upon once mentioned someone had given him a human head as a gift,<br/>
and he wished to know whose it was.  With that song I was able to tell him<br/>
the name of the disgusting little pet head he carried around with him.  The<br/>
song is often useful for getting clues with quest items.  I once found a key<br/>
and used the song to tell me it was a High Hold Strongbox key.  Many of the<br/>
messages you get from items using this song have not been implemented yet<br/>
(that&#39;s what pending lore means!).  Bards get a song to learn the lore<br/>
behind the item, and though the lore might often be pointless, of course<br/>
bards should know it!  So the song is good.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I use this song more often that Mellifluous Motion!  Now THERE&#39;s<br/>
a song I see no purpose for!  It seems to function like the old D&D spell<br/>
Blink, but for it to be useful at all I think it would need its pulses<br/>
shortened.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a joke-song, and often a cruel joke at that.<br/>

&gt;explain a bit later.  The z-axis need to be fixed period.  The level 14<br/>

do not have enough going for us to make pointless songs acceptable.  These<br/>
sudden missed</div>
