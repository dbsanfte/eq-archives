&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot;<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>
travel,<br/>
&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>
&gt; which you said the celts were not.<br/>
<br/>
That is infact NOT what I said.. I said that bards where not merely<br/>
musicians.  That Bards were beings of power and great importants and more<br/>
then just a singer of song or player of lute.. there were those too in<br/>
celtic life.  You might remember one of the Bardsongs never correctly<br/>
inplimented in EQ was a lore song to learn the truth of what an item is.<br/>
Something monks needed for one of their quests.  Bards also have to travel<br/>
cities much earlier then anyone else to learn their songs... why would this<br/>
be so.. think about it.. So that the bards could trade tales and wisdom<br/>
across the lands.  Your problem I think is your are already decided what is<br/>
and is not, and haven&#39;t really left yourself open to the options.<br/>
<br/>
 I could handle bards wearing chain in a<br/>
&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>
both<br/>
&gt; sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i<br/>
appreciated<br/>
&gt; that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>
&gt; you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>
&gt; argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>
&gt; bards.<br/>
<br/>
As I said in my post I respect the rights of all to go as they choose but<br/>
from a role playing perspective based on &quot;history&quot; then there is very little<br/>
ground to support the non plate position other then lack of plate in the<br/>
historic period.  The bard&#39;s ability to use magic alone comes form the<br/>
celtic stories of Tailsin who drank the sorceress&#39;s potion of wisdom and<br/>
foretold much of what was to come.. and Amergin&#39;s legend of putting an<br/>
entire field of warriors to sleep..  Equally both engaged in combat more<br/>
then once.  Like I said I can respect your characters choice.. but to say<br/>
that as a class bards would not use plate armor is like saying a priest has<br/>
never raised his hand to defend the faith.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>
&gt; commited to convictions.  -=)<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>
&gt; &gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.  Infact I have on more<br/>
&gt; &gt; then one occasion parited with groups above my exp gain level for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sole purpose of helping them and recording their first visit to a new<br/>
&gt; land.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unlike many I&#39;m willing to bet I also sing sea chanties on boatrides,<br/>
&gt; &gt; make little poems for each of my songs (lyrics) etc.  I also game,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have fought wisps till blue in the face (anyone else pissed at the<br/>
&gt; nosave<br/>
&gt; &gt; now turned burned out lightstone bull?) and have kited,soloed, grouped<br/>
&gt; &gt; and twisted with the best of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m tired of seeing this roleplay plate mail talk and quite a few<br/>
others,<br/>
&gt; &gt; let me give you abit of backround.  The EQ bard seems to me best<br/>
compared<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the CELTIC bard.  It&#39;s important to understand the Celtic bard as<br/>
opposed<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; what we have come to call a bard.  The religion of the celts being<br/>
Druidic<br/>
&gt; &gt; was split in several sections with three primary universal among the<br/>
&gt; tribes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The preist/mage type the ones we typically see in flowing robes and call<br/>
&gt; druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; that most RPG&#39;s consider.  The judge section Gaelic Brehon (sp) who<br/>
&gt; administered<br/>
&gt; &gt; clan law and succession issues. And the Bard who recorded the histories,<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; &gt; the tales, taught the faith, ran the messages, recorded the liniages<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The celtic bard was by no means some weak pansy musician, nor a figure<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; lightly.  The bard seldome directly fought in wars but was certainly<br/>
often<br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; &gt; trained in arms and would often run into situations in his travels where<br/>
&gt; fightin<br/>
&gt; &gt; was needed.  In the period Plate was not an option and so from a<br/>
&gt; historical point, the bard would not have worn plate, however the Celts<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; invent chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that being the strongest of the time would have worn that if they<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; access it (bards of the stonger clans) so there is no reason to say they<br/>
&gt; would reject plate.<br/>
