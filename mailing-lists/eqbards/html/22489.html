&gt; &gt;Nice. Was there a reason the following were omitted or did I just miss it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;/cast #<br/>
&gt; &gt;/sit (on/off)<br/>
&gt; &gt;/pause<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, it would be nice if they were separated into different sections by<br/>
&gt; &gt;type, but heck, it&#39;s a great list anyway!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I actually had those in the &quot;buffer&quot; waiting to be added - but I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;made changes since September.  I&#39;m working on it now, though - so by the<br/>
&gt;end of the day, they should be accurate. In fact, if you ever find an error<br/>
&gt;or a new command, please don&#39;t hesitate to email<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
