<div id="ygrps-yiv-228946905">One thing I soloed at 25th were the Crag Spiders in East Karanas.  As with<br/>
most tough mobs that don&#39;t drop cash, they are a good source of experience.<br/>
I could probably make a bubble of experience by soloing about 12 or so at<br/>
level 25.  They do routinely drop three or four spider silks, however, and I<br/>
understand that if you carry a sewing kit with you, you can reduce them to<br/>
silk swatches which are stackable.  I have not tried this however, although<br/>
I&#39;d like to.  Supposedly two spider silks make one stackable silk swatch.<br/>
Watch out of Hill Giants on the hill where they are found (although the<br/>
giants may be hunted to extinction right now).<br/>

&gt; I think I want to try soloing some now.  Anyone have suggestions<br/>
&gt; of places I<br/>
&gt; can solo successfully at 25th level?  At 23d level, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; solo rooks in<br/>
&gt; SK.  I think I might be able to do it now.   This assumption is based on<br/>
&gt; better combat skills/hit points plus I now have the Psalm of<br/>
&gt; Warmth.  Is it<br/>
&gt; safe to assume that weaving Psalm of Warmth with two other songs will do<br/>
&gt; more damage than a Bellow?  How much do mobs get burned for per hit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
