<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277681747">My advice? Travel, do it, go for it. It&#39;s much safer than people make out <br/>
to be. Folks have one sour experience and they tend to aggrandize their <br/>
difficulties, aggravated by the frustration they may have felt at the time. <br/>
Not that I haven&#39;t had my share of crappy times... ;)<br/>
In general I&#39;ve found traveling to be one of the more rewarding things to <br/>
do in this game, for me personally. Go for it, my reccomendation is to not <br/>
stick to zone borders. Get your sense heading up, do a nice big zig-zag <br/>
pattern across new zones, just to make sure you see a good chunk of the <br/>
landmarks and inhabitants, have your drum in hand and just... go... ;)<br/>
Go.<br/>

of the 6th level, in the company of a much higher level group and with the<br/>
benefit of Spirit of the Wolf for more speed.  It was somewhat of an ordeal<br/>
and I died twice trying to get through the minotaur pass, both times from<br/>
being stunned and disoriented as I tried to run through.  Without the work<br/>
and indulgence of the group I wouldn&#39;t have made it.  They even eventually<br/>
recovered all my belongings from my corpse.<br/>

As a 10th level bard with a 10th level cleric friend I&#39;m getting more and<br/>
more interested in wider travel either alone or the two of us, but my fear<br/>
of the unknown keeps me from it.  It would be helpful to hear of the<br/>
adventures of other experienced travellers to help set my own expectations<br/>
properly.<br/>
<br/>
My fears are 1) getting lost, and 2) getting in overwhelming trouble from<br/>
getting into an area that&#39;s just too tough.<br/>
