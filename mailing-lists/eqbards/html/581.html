<div id="ygrps-yiv-345502826">My mistake, heh, it is 17, not 18.  I realized that after logging in right<br/>
after my post.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info, everyone who posted.  Very informative.  Especially the<br/>
LONG one, heh....<br/>
<br/>
I was using the &quot;efficiency rating&quot; method to determine the better weapon,<br/>
but after seeing the DPS method, I like that better.  It does seem to be<br/>
more accurate.  For example.<br/>
<br/>
A (fictional) weapon with a 10 Dam and a 20 Delay has an efficiency rating<br/>
of .5 and a DPS of 10.5<br/>
A (fictional) weapon with a 20 Dam and a 40 Delay has an efficiency rating<br/>
of .5 and a DPS of 10.25<br/>
<br/>
Slight difference... but, it&#39;s there.  Of course, if you follow J.M., you&#39;d<br/>
go with the faster one anyway (quicker attacks = more chances for double<br/>
attack) if you&#39;re a melee class with double attack... This makes a helluva<br/>
lotta sense, but unless one of our ranks is moonlighting as another class,<br/>
we don&#39;t have double attack.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Question I still have then, is all geared around Strength.  Both these<br/>
methods do not incorporate strength into the equation, tho strength does<br/>
have an effect of how hard you&#39;d hit.  What is the lower limit of any<br/>
weapon?  Are you utilizing your strength bonuses more by carrying the Higher<br/>
Damage weapon and hitting for more raw power, or by hitting more often for<br/>
slightly more power?  And same with lower strength.... Does anyone have data<br/>
or an idea of a calculation to determine this?  The answer is vaguely in<br/>
front of my eyes, and I can not quite grasp it.  : )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that Bards are typically considered artists and this type of<br/>
thread might not interest them.  If you&#39;re bored by this, I apologize, tho<br/>
you probably quit reading long ago.  :)<br/>
