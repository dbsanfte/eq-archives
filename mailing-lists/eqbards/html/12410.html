L40 did 15-18 points per tick against mobs, or 45-54 points<br/>
damage per application.  Much better than Bellow, and<br/>
(assuming I&#39;m reapplying the song every 10 seconds as part of<br/>
a three-some) equals a good fraction of my damage with<br/>
weapons.<br/>

the DoT when I tested it.  And are you talking about<br/>
stop/start pulses, or leave the song playing pulses?<br/>
