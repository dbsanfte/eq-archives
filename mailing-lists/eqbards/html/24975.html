 </span></blockquote>I think that this is more deliberate, as opposed to a mathematic function <br/>
of the game engine.  In other words, they&#39;ve deliberately chosen to <br/>
increase the faction hits from those mobs, instead of just leaving a line <br/>
of code that says &quot;FACTIONHIT=LEVEL OF MOB / 5&quot;  That was my whole point - <br/>
that it&#39;s not a function of level, but a function of creature design.<br/>
