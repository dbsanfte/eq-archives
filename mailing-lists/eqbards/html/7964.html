involved, in which case the range is as far as you can see<br/>
:-).  I used this song to practice up my brass skill a bit.  I<br/>
feared a bunch of snakes, skunks, etc. in Butcherblock and set<br/>
myself on a hill near a goblin camp.  The critters would run<br/>
away, turn around, come back, run away, repeat.  The folks<br/>
fighting the goblins would use me as a safe zone if they got<br/>
in trouble (run to me, let me fear the mob(s) attacking them,<br/>
rest and heal up, continue the fight).  Anyways, with so many<br/>
critters running back and forth, you get a pretty good idea<br/>
what the range is as a bunch of them will run away while some<br/>
incoming ones just a little further away not be affected.  I<br/>
would estimate the range as being about the same as melee<br/>
range.<br/>
