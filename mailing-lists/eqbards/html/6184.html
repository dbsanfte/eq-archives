<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-580626284">Hmm I schwacked Nerbilkk a couple levs ago - I thought he was white to me at<br/>
19/20 - I had a high lev wiz with me (could not have solo&#39;d him) - we were<br/>
looking for the Pirate Captn and just screwing around when we found<br/>
Nerblikk.  His loot is kinda crazy - dwarf pickles and a recipe. And a<br/>
fishing spear - crazy stabber wep.<br/>
<br/>
The recipe is an item needed for the Grobb Cleaver quest - hell how can this<br/>
be a spoiler if the quest guy tells you he wants it?  Ok, so maybe the<br/>
location of this guy is the spoiler part.  And how is a troll/ogre supposed<br/>
to get to the boats in east freeport any ways???  Could prolly sell the<br/>
recipe to some oger/troll interested in a Grobb Cleaver.<br/>
<br/>
Might be time to go  back and pay him another visit - esp if they nerf druid<br/>
kiting and we cant pull avo&#39;s any more. bard 24, mage 25 with pet, 25 druid<br/>
- druid finds and kites the avo down to basically very low hp then pulls him<br/>
to the pet.  I barely have enough time to target and attack before the avo<br/>
is dead.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise get into groups in HighKeep Lookout room and guard room for lo to<br/>
mid 20&#39;s. Warrior room for later 20&#39;s and into 30&#39;s.  It hack slask, rinse,<br/>
repeat, but it moves the bar.<br/>

		Ah, only to my bard friends do I release this info,<br/>
		but there&#39;s a troll out in the OOT that you can solo<br/>
		around 24 or so.  May need to take one person, he&#39;ll<br/>
		be on one of the rocks around the sirens.  He got me<br/>
		over the mid-20&#39;s slump.  Unlike herman the hermit, I<br/>
		never once got there and found him camped, and the<br/>
		boat passes quite nearby to catch for a ride back to<br/>
		FP.  Hope that helps you get to the upper 20&#39;s anyway.<br/>
