<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386960529">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 I have been lurking for a long time on this list and want to express my<br/>
appreation for all I have learned from everyone here:) Does anyone know what<br/>
lvl the singing steel effect works? I know summoning water isn&#39;t such a big<br/>
deal, but my evil friends are sometimes out or nearly out of food and water<br/>
when I hook up with them. Being a baker, I usually have food I can give them,<br/>
but being able to summon water for them would sure be nice. Does the water<br/>
poof when you log like mage summoned water? Thanks in advance for the help.<br/>
