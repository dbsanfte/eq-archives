&gt;I hit 40 begging skill over the weekend and the difference is<br/>
&gt;like night and day.  Whereas with a skill of 39 I&#39;d have to<br/>
&gt;beg 5 or 10 times for each success (targeting amiable paladin<br/>
&gt;guards in North Freeport), at 40 skill I&#39;m succeeding more<br/>
&gt;than half the time.  The success rate still stinks with the<br/>
&gt;dubious militia guards in West Freeport though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still get 1 cp per successful beg.  I&#39;ve had one paladin<br/>
&gt;give me 1 sp, but that&#39;s it.  All my other successes have<br/>
&gt;yielded only 1 cp.  My guildmates are complaining that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;giving the guild a bad reputation by begging around the bank<br/>
&gt;so much.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I estimate I&#39;ve successfully begged close to two hundred times<br/>
&gt;(I dumped something like 35 practice points into the skill),<br/>
&gt;and the paladins are still amiable to me.  I once begged from<br/>
&gt;one paladin nonstop for half an hour, and he never got upset<br/>
&gt;or attacked me.  The dubious milita has not attacked me<br/>
&gt;either.  I did beg from the dubious S. Ro dark elf merchants<br/>
&gt;and they got upset and attacked me.  Fortunately, it was a<br/>
&gt;drive-by beg (target them from a distance, run by at full<br/>
&gt;speed with Accelerando and a drum, and hit beg just as I pass)<br/>
&gt;so they didn&#39;t even hit me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;How DARE you beg from me!&quot;  :-)<br/>
