I must have meant <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html</a> , but for some<br/>
reason I think I found a link to that one last night and its a different<br/>
site that&#39;s still missing.  Guess I&#39;ll find out when I get home.  If I try<br/>
to hit this link here at work alarm bells will go off all over the company<br/>
alerting security forces that someone is stealing company time.  Perhaps<br/>
they should monitor my email more.  }-]<br/>

Whatever site it was, I was pretty sure your name was on it somewhere,<br/>
though it may have only been to credit you for contributions.<br/>
