<div id="ygrps-yiv-442730462">i think that may in fact be the case.  i was told that not only are small<br/>
races not able to wear the hero bracer, but they can not complete the quest<br/>
as well.  could be wrong, though that is what i was told by someone who has<br/>
done the quest numerous times, and i know we wood elves can not wear one,<br/>
darnit!<br/>
