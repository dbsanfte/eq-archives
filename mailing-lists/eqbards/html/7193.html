I have been feedbacking and petitioning this every week or so.<br/>
I am big on high efficiency and low downtime, as any bard should<br/>
be.  We are the party glue, and create a highly reliable/stable<br/>
grouping environment.  When a player goes linkdead, the party<br/>
doesnt realize it and fumbles around a little.  Buffs dont stick <br/>
to linkdead players, yet they still take mana as if it worked.<br/>
Every other game (including all the muds I&#39;ve played on) had<br/>
some sort of message indicating the players &#39;link&#39; status.<br/>
<br/>
But with this improvement, watch out for our Accelerando song<br/>
to only take effect when you are swimming or in Neriak only.<br/>
And you must pat your head, and rub your drum on your tummy.<br/>
Even then you will have about 95% chance of missing the note.<br/>
