Mine is 110.  I have found lullaby to be a fantastic song.  <br/>
The only creatures that consistently resist it are reds, but<br/>
then those are the mobs my group targets first.  Yellows<br/>
resist it maybe 30%-60% of the time (which still makes it<br/>
worthwhile).  Blues maybe 20%-40%. Greens often end up asleep<br/>
almost throughout an entire fight, waking up only a couple<br/>
times before going back to sleep (which is good because greens<br/>
start attacking you if they happen to be nearby when you sing<br/>
it).  I have used it on dervishes, undead, wisps, bears, fire<br/>
elements, and those spellcasting snakes in lavastorm.<br/>
