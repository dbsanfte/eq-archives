<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-787325959">I am suprised no one else has noticed this yet, but over the weekend i<br/>
discovered (and had it confirmed and tested by another high level bard) that<br/>
the lvl 51 chains song no longer overwrites snare (we know it doesnt<br/>
overwrite root, but snare was a suprise)!  <br/>
<br/>
I also tested the chains song with the Enchanter Slow line, and the<br/>
enchanter slow overwrites the lvl51 song, but not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
What this boils down to (from my observations of the lvl 51 song):<br/>
<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to snare a mob if in doubt that it is snared<br/>
or rooted<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without fear of canceling<br/>
snare<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without the fear of blocking<br/>
an Enchanter slow<br/>
<br/>
What I have not tested:<br/>
<br/>
*	Other versions of our chains (the lvl 23 and lvl 54 aoe song) and<br/>
slow songs (lvl 21 aoe) against snare or slow<br/>
*	Any of the songs against the Shaman slow series<br/>
*	All of my snare tests were done against low-level druid snare.  I<br/>
did not test any of the songs against the higher level Ensnare.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been my understanding that our slowing effects stack with<br/>
Enchanter or Shaman slowing effects (but previous to the last patch would<br/>
block them if our song was up on the mob when the spell was cast).  If my<br/>
above testing proves to be true, this means that we are &quot;value added&quot; to<br/>
enchanters and shaman both now, at least from a mana and slowing standpoint!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing if you guys get similiar results!<br/>
