<div id="ygrps-yiv-921520625">Hehe,<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting to meet someone at the NK Wizard&#39;s gate point and<br/>
eavesdropping on a couple hi levs who were medding and buffing.  The druid<br/>
cast SoW on the caster, then on herself and then on me. wtf??  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hehe, thanks - but I am a bard ya know!&quot; (rubbing it in &lt;eg&gt;) &quot;Now you will<br/>
go even faster&quot; she says. &quot;Uhhh, don&#39;t think so....&quot;  So then her caster<br/>
buddy pipes up: &quot;Race her with Cheetah...&quot; &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll race you and use<br/>
Cheetah. First one to Qeynos wins!,&quot; I say. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh no, no.  Just to the EK bridge,&quot; she says. She&#39;s high 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s.  I&#39;m<br/>
21. We&#39;re both a bit encumbered. And off we go.  I got a bad line for the<br/>
bridge and hit the river too soon.  She beat me pretty handily but only<br/>
because she knew the direct route - I think.  She told me that I looked<br/>
faster and she thought she was gonna lose but then lost sight of me.<br/>
<br/>
I challenged her to a re-match: EK bridge to the HH ramp &lt;eg&gt; &quot;No, I know<br/>
about that shortcut,&quot; she says. Hehe, Oh well, it was worth a try.<br/>
<br/>

		Selos is awesome. I am 39th with a Battledrum, and I always<br/>
get tells saying<br/>
		WTF?!!!! I blow by any Bard and SoW&#39;rs may as well be<br/>
sitting having a beer.<br/>
		I blow by so fast I even hear shouts sayin who the heck just<br/>
ran past me? I<br/>
		couldnt target them they were over the horizon too fast. I<br/>
can carry 160lbs<br/>
		at 90 str and outrun SoW easily. Oh yeah at 30th with the<br/>
drum I raced a<br/>
		Shaman using Cheetah, it was a tie. He wont race me anymore<br/>
because he knows<br/>
		I am skill based.<br/>
		 <br/>
		One bummer, GMs have a spell called SoN (spirit of Norrath)<br/>
and the same<br/>
		friend raced the GM, and the GM blew him away really badly.<br/>
I guess<br/>
		challenging that 50th Bard GM to a race is out.</div>
