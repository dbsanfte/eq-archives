<div id="ygrps-yiv-796500291">Ok, I finally got the chance to play for a few hours after this morning&#39;s<br/>
upgrade and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed so far (limited spoilers):<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s now a new character in Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild, try talking to him.<br/>
:) (there, that&#39;s the spoiler--enjoy)<br/>
<br/>
The boat between Freeport and Kaladim is running alot faster now (kinda a<br/>
shock--almost reported it as a bug after getting used to waiting 45<br/>
minutes for it).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this is because of the update or not, but I&#39;m having a<br/>
_heck_ of a time seeing other players.  I almost ended up stealing<br/>
someone&#39;s kill because I didn&#39;t see them until after I had run up on the<br/>
monster in question and threw a dagger.  Thankfully, I missed...and then<br/>
the player in question was in sight.  I&#39;ll keep an eye on it later, when<br/>
I&#39;m on at my more usual time--just in case I was suffering from lag.  But<br/>
I thought I&#39;d mention it anyway, in case others have had similar<br/>
problems.<br/>
