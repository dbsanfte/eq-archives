<div id="ygrps-yiv-712249436">Number of questions made that I&#39;ll just sum up in this one message.<br/>
<br/>
1.	Where is Kelin&#39; Lugubrious Lament?<br/>
<br/>
	Kelethin Bard&#39;s Guild. Bout 4 plat, 6 gold.<br/>
<br/>
2.	What does it do?<br/>
<br/>
	Lowers a creature&#39;s reaction to you (won&#39;t attack you) for a short while.<br/>
Don&#39;t try to get a screenshot of yourself standing next to the creature<br/>
though. =) I think help is the thing that makes them come after you if you<br/>
attack one of their buddies. (Orc camps are prime examples). Agro<br/>
(arressiveness) would prolly be what makes it decide to attack you for<br/>
simply invading its personal space. It does seem to wear off after a short<br/>
while. And I think the skill needed is singing so no instrument.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Does Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord work yet?<br/>
<br/>
	The damage part of it works, can&#39;t tell about the AC penalty though.<br/>
<br/>
4.	Hymn of Restoration in combat?<br/>
<br/>
	I almost always play it unless I know I can easily defeat the creature I&#39;m<br/>
fighting against. Even though you only get a few hps back a tick, it will be<br/>
significant during a long battle. Many a times have I been victorious<br/>
because of those extra hps I healed during the fight. This song seems to do<br/>
an extra 2hps for every 6 levels gained after 6th.<br/>
<br/>
5.	Same post mentioned about running and bellowing a wisp.<br/>
<br/>
	Heh, how about that. This song seems to do an extra 1 damage for every 2<br/>
levels gained after 12th.<br/>
<br/>
6.	A post about experience percentages.<br/>
<br/>
	The only thing I can attribute is that the level window for exp in a group<br/>
might not be as it is written (which I&#39;ve seen written to be 4 levels<br/>
wide)...<br/>
<br/>
7.	On a matter of starting a bard and what attributes should be picked.<br/>
<br/>
	In beta I jacked my charisma and got fairly good prices as the most<br/>
immediate benefit. For final I put enough into strength to wear plate and<br/>
everything else into dexterity so that my chance to hit is greater. I seem<br/>
to be fairly adept at hitting near or at the top range of the damage scale<br/>
so I don&#39;t know if any more strength will help in combat. I do seem to be<br/>
hitting more then in beta with the better dex, though. Only drop into<br/>
intelligence if you *really* want your skills to rocket. It has no effect on<br/>
songs since we don&#39;t use mana. I prolly wouldn&#39;t even consider it really.<br/>
<br/>
8.	Quests in Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
	Almost all quests I&#39;ve seen can be done as many times as you want. The game<br/>
doesn&#39;t really seem to keep track of state other then any item you might be<br/>
given, which would key the next part of the quest when you give it to the<br/>
correct person. I&#39;ve seen newbie bards make the &#39;watch report&#39; run to the<br/>
docks in Queynos over and over again to get 2nd level without fighting a<br/>
thing. It&#39;s not often you&#39;ll find a quest that will give more money that<br/>
what is required to buy the things neccessary to complete it. Good example<br/>
are the Deathfist Slashed Belts that cost about 3 gold in stores but you get<br/>
maybe 7 copper back when you hand them in to the quest person. Course you<br/>
get a good faction adjustment....<br/>
<br/>
9.	Charging fees for corpse hunting.<br/>
<br/>
	Chances are good that if they forgot to do a /loc before dying they don&#39;t<br/>
know how much they might have on them in terms of money so they won&#39;t know<br/>
if they can pay you until you get there. Usually the &#39;accept any donations&#39;<br/>
thing works well unless they are real knobs, in which case you can lead them<br/>
into some nasty spot, drop them from the group, turn on speed, and burn<br/>
outta there leaving them behind. =) jk Seriously, if they lost a character<br/>
before, they&#39;ll reward you well.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>
