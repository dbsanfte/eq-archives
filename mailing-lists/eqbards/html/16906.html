<div id="ygrps-yiv-127315901">I&#39;ll second that Taneran.  Drives me up a wall when I&#39;m in a good group and the caster panics and starts bolting for the zone or even worse when they start zig zaging all over the place I&#39;ve found charm is a great uber taunt as is chains and will usually get the mob back on me.. Accept when the wimpy caster is running all over dragging the mob out of range.. usually drives the other melee types nuts too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Only advice I have is get a druid to group wtih you.	Once they cast that<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage shield on you, the mobs don&#39;t give a FIG about you!  They just<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; pounding the wimpy druid *snicker*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interestingly enough, the highest taunt value spell that a druid seems to<br/>
&gt; have IMHO is snare.  I&#39;ve seen a druid NUKE NUKE NUKE and the warrior has no<br/>
&gt; problems continuing to taunt the mob... but throw a snare up!  Wow the MOBs<br/>
&gt; go crazy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a side note, one of the most annoying things for my wife&#39;s warrior is<br/>
&gt; those druids, wizards, bards and other wimpy (relative to her) hitpoint<br/>
&gt; types is when they run from a mob instead of standing there and taking<br/>
&gt; their beating. Makes it virtually impossible for her to successfully taunt<br/>
&gt; the mob off the person. We always tell our nukers &quot;stand still and take<br/>
&gt; your beating! we got healers :)&quot;.<br/>
