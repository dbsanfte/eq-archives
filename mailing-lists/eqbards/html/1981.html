<div id="ygrps-yiv-180826222">Actually you can get it faster than that.  Pay a high level wizard to<br/>
teleport you to Greater Faydark.  It does cost about 10 plat for a round<br/>
trip ticket, but maybe someone in your group is already high enough level to<br/>
do it.<br/>

I actually paid for the ticket, yeah it costs a lot, but I was there bought<br/>
what I needed and was back in less than 10 minutes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; But why anyone thinks paying more than steel weapons prices for weapons<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are better than well balanced is a rip-off is beyond me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like I said, if it&#39;s more than about 20pp, it&#39;s more cost-time<br/>
&gt; effective for me to just go to Crushbone and get one myself.<br/>
&gt; Worst case, it&#39;s about two hours round trip from Freeport to<br/>
&gt; Crushbone and getting a shot a Dvinn.  In an equivalent amount<br/>
&gt; of time, my friends and I can currently rake in about 20-30pp<br/>
&gt; of loot killing general mobs.  If someone wants to charge me 5<br/>
&gt; hours of loot for an item that takes me 2 hours to get myself,<br/>
&gt; I will just get it myself in 2 hours and spend the remaining 3<br/>
&gt; hours enjoying the dirk and earning money for myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really think you guys need to make Dvinn a rarer spawn, or<br/>
&gt; give him a different weapon most of the time instead of the<br/>
&gt; dirk.  The availability of the dirk is out of proportion to<br/>
&gt; the other special weapons in the game at that level.<br/>
