&gt; The words: &quot;I will take a look at this&quot; are missing.  I don&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; feeling that GZ recognizes it as a bug. My read is that he is brushing it<br/>
&gt; off as &#39;anecdotal evidence&#39; and one player&#39;s opinion rather than accepting<br/>
&gt; the possibility of a bug or unintentional change. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well this isn&#39;t surprising in light of the recent information we&#39;ve<br/>
found out from the Shaman&#39;s alchemy. Verant is willing to ignore 100&#39;s<br/>
of bug reports and feedback regarding alchemy being broken rather than<br/>
go take a look at their (later) admitted badly designed test procedure.<br/>
<br/>
As we know bards get no testing at all, what hope do we have of getting<br/>
this fixed or even looked at.<br/>
