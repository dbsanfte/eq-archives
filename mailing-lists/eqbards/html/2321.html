&gt; &gt; Selling in the warriours guild in Kelethin yeilds better prices than <br/>

&gt;Killing Crushbone orcs raises your faction with several guilds<br/>
&gt;including the warrior&#39;s guild.  But AFAIK, there is no way to<br/>
&gt;raise your faction with the bard&#39;s guild other than quests.<br/>
&gt;So it&#39;s possible to get enough faction for the warrior&#39;s<br/>
&gt;merchant to view you more highly than the bard merchant (who<br/>
&gt;has always viewed me amiably).  I was surprised to find at<br/>
&gt;least one merchant in Kaladim who kindly considers me (which<br/>
&gt;is higher than warmly which is higher than amiable).<br/>
