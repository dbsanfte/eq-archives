&gt; &gt; Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for everyone to<br/>
&gt; &gt; /assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t always have an enchanter in the group, so the topic<br/>
still warrants discussion.  Some of the things you find are<br/>
not so obvious.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in a 2-mob pull, I&#39;ll usually Pixie Strike the<br/>
weaker (less chance of resists, less damage I take when I&#39;m<br/>
resisted) while the group kills the stronger.  We found out<br/>
the hard way that a paladin + ranger + cleric take a really<br/>
really long time and use up almost all their mana to kill a<br/>
bok knight.  Meanwhile, I sat there PSing a dar knight for<br/>
probably 5-8 minutes, occasionally tossing in a buff here or<br/>
there trying to make myself somewhat useful.<br/>
<br/>
The next time this happened, I just PSed the bok continuously<br/>
(no other buffs) while the group killed the dar.  Not only did<br/>
they manage to kill the dar, they killed another dar, wan, and<br/>
urd who wandered into the fight.  The bok only woke up twice,<br/>
and I was able to get it back under control requiring only a<br/>
single heal.  Then all of us killed the bok.  If we&#39;d done it<br/>
the other way, I would&#39;ve ended up having to control 2 dars, a<br/>
wan, and an urd while my group fought the bok.  (Controlling 4<br/>
mobs is not impossible, but really difficult - charm one, PS 2<br/>
others.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, mez is not the ultimate crowd control solution.  If your<br/>
enchanter has multiple mobs mezed and your group is taking a<br/>
long time to hack down each one, there&#39;s a danger the<br/>
enchanter could go OOM keeping up the mezes.  In that case,<br/>
it&#39;s better to charm a couple mobs (both you and enchanter<br/>
can, but probably safer if only you do it so the enchanter can<br/>
keep up the mezing).  That&#39;ll help the group kill the current<br/>
target much more quickly.  When I try to do this, nothing<br/>
annoys me more than an enchanter who insists on mezing the mob<br/>
I&#39;m charming.  (I did this to Rokenn&#39;s pet once so I&#39;m not<br/>
completely innocent either.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Another mistake I see groups make is to not take their time<br/>
when they have the luxury of crowd control.  Too many people<br/>
feel that immediately after killing a mob, they have to start<br/>
hacking away at the next mesmerized mob.  In one unfortunate<br/>
case, the cleric went OOM healing us from the current mob, the<br/>
tanks killed it, and instead of waiting to give the cleric<br/>
some time to rest up, immediately jumped on the next mob.  <br/>
They also (incorrectly) followed the &quot;kill the caster first&quot;<br/>
rule when a relatively weak melee mob was also standing by<br/>
mezed.  As a result, the caster nuked two of the melee folks<br/>
to death before we bailed out of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I explained it to them afterwards - in between mezed mob kills<br/>
is basically free time, equivalent to you being able to cast<br/>
heals and buffs with zero combat delay, debuff the mob with no<br/>
threat of retalization, and being able to med and (with a<br/>
bard) heal up.  Next time this happened they listened when I<br/>
said &quot;kill the (green) melee mob next.&quot;  As a result, the<br/>
cleric had about 45 seconds to med in peace, while I played<br/>
Clarity and Hymn to give each of the tanks back about a half<br/>
bubble despite the damage they were taking from the greenie.<br/>
<br/>
So there are lots of situations where turning conventional<br/>
tactics on their head result in better outcomes.<br/>
