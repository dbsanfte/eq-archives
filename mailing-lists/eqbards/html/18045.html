<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225088506"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I use the numbers across the top of the keyboard.<br/>
&gt; Of course, I have a Natural keyboard -- I wonder if the distance<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doubt it.  But see I hit shift with my left pinky and use might right hand<br/>
on the numpad.  No stretch whatsoever that way.  In fact, I move so little<br/>
while playing EQ that I&#39;m just BOUND to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You turn with how the mouse moves. And you&#39;re always going forward<br/>
&gt; whichever way you&#39;re facing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rats.  I thought it was a way of looking around without changing direction.<br/>
