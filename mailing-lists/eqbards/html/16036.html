<b>Subject:</b> Fishbone Earing advice... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-332026506">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been getting on in levels and have begun to start thinking about<br/>
kedge keep as an underpopulated place I could go to gain some exp. That<br/>
being said the natural progression is to pick up some fishbone earings.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m here for some advice. I don&#39;t want to spoil anyone&#39;s fun so I won&#39;t<br/>
mention the name of the mob or the zone, I was just wondering if any of you<br/>
have killed him firsthand. If so, what level would you recommend for soloing<br/>
him or for a party killing him. Also, what faction hits do you take (if you<br/>
remember)<br/>
