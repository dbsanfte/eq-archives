 </span></blockquote>I have said long and often that I do not WANT bind.  I just want some way <br/>
to guarantee that I can GET a bind when I go to remote cities (like Erudin <br/>
and such).  It&#39;s unfair that spellcasters aren&#39;t penalized for playing when <br/>
it&#39;s late or on the Test Server.  THAT&#39;s what I complain about.  Maybe I <br/>
should mention this on the boards?<br/>
