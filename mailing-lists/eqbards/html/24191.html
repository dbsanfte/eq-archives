<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325107349"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;8) Screech (never changes, see below)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;any of the songs that are not &quot;never changes&quot; of course i can swap out for<br/>
&gt;any rarely used or situational song i may need, e.g. charimsatic carillion.<br/>
&gt;as far as #8 Appaling Screech, i really need to rethink this.  i am never in<br/>
&gt;an area anymore where this song will not be resisted by everything i sing it<br/>
&gt;on.  it used to be such a handy song, but with the fear cap i need something<br/>
&gt;else here, any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>how about DDD, heh.  oh, by the way, does the SSS supposedly increases the<br/>
effects of some singing songs.  does it increase damage done by either bellow or<br/>
DDD?</div>
