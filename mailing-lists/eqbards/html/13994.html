<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528589779"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.  Will the song damage other party members if they are too close to the<br/>
&gt; target when you play it?  I know it will hurt the bard but what about other<br/>
&gt; party members?  And what about other PC&#39;s non-party members?<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You can never damage any PCs in the game with any use of force.<br/>
  PCs get the &quot;you are protected message&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  What practical use is this song? The re-cycle time is so long as to make<br/>
&gt; it quite limited.  Indoors, its application seems limited - not real sure<br/>
&gt; what the distance to avoid damage is but that probably constrains its use.<br/>
&gt; It is AE so on one hand it damages multiple mobs but then do you have all of<br/>
&gt; them agro on you? If you have an enchanter, then you need to use it before<br/>
&gt; they do crowd control so timing is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  There is no practical use.  The recycle time is over one hour.<br/>
  I use the song whenever I see a full mana bar to kill off things<br/>
  quicker or to eliminate a pile of green attackers.  The distance<br/>
  away from the target to not take dmg is small.  One side of the<br/>
  king room to the other is far enough not to be hit by your own <br/>
  song.  I&#39;ve never had things agro on me with this song even <br/>
  during multiple mob encounters.  I wouldn&#39;t even keep this song<br/>
  mem&#39;d in the lineup.  Most enchanters will insist no AEs were<br/>
  used while they are around, whether it wakes them up or not.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  Does it get resisted like other casters dmg spells?  Full resists?<br/>
&gt; Partial resists?  The da&#39;goon took 228 dmg and I thought 311 was the base.<br/>
&gt; But they are know to have high MR factors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Partial and Full.  Try it on Ogres Guards, you&#39;ll see the full<br/>
  spectrum of resists.  I once hit for 5 dmg.  Then again I hit<br/>
  for 325 as well.  And most of the time (L43-L45) they just out-<br/>
  right resist it period.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s nice for finishing off a battle or helping clear the world<br/>
  of rats, bats, and snakes - but that&#39;s about it.<br/>
