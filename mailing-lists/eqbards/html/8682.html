&gt; I just got two HG&#39;s to duke it out yesterday as well (my first time).  Got<br/>
&gt; the EXP for both.  I am level 30 with 104 Charisma.  If I remember<br/>
&gt; correctly, they only resisted once or twice.  Needless to say, that was the<br/>
&gt; quickest 54pp I&#39;ve ever made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feeling pretty macho, I went down to Rathe Mnts to do some serious Giant<br/>
&gt; killing.  For some reason, or another, the HG&#39;s there resist A LOT more than<br/>
&gt; the the HG&#39;s in West Commons.  I had one resist about 9 times in a row.<br/>
&gt; Very disconcerting.  In fact, I didn&#39;t even bother to finish the fight..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unless there really is something different about the resists <br/>
of the hill giants in the Commonlands, you probably got lucky<br/>
the first time.  The high number of resists makes this a<br/>
dangerous tactic.  If you have to keep Accelerando going,<br/>
you&#39;re only getting in a charm attempt every other song or so.<br/>
Obviously if you have SoW or Jboots like the original claimant<br/>
did, then it&#39;s a lot easier as you can just mash the charm<br/>
button over and over while using the mouse to stay clear.<br/>
Trying to do it with Accelerando, one slipup and you&#39;re<br/>
bashed/stunned and down two bubbles before you have a chance<br/>
to even try to restart Accelerando.<br/>
