Yes, I have heard those guards.  Have not done the Clothspinner quest.<br/>
Also, talk to the female bard merch just inside West Karana on the Qeynos<br/>
side.  She mentions a Guard by name and tells you that he is doing something<br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you hang around long enough in the Qey bard guild - a npc comes in<br/>
and tells a tale and plays a new song he has written.<br/>
<br/>
And then there is the whole business with the Irontoes.  Trumpy who hangs<br/>
out in Fish&#39;s Ale (extermely brazen when there is such a bounty on his head)<br/>
and Crumpy who patrols in QH and Tumpy who is in the inn in Kaladim.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, and why so many DE nastys? Dorn, Dvinn, Gix, Zixx or Nixx (the Paw<br/>
DE)- any others?<br/>
<br/>
Who is Branick Notai?  Ever read the note you deliver to Gnasher.  What<br/>
note?  Have you ever axed the bartender in the back of Fish&#39;s Ale if he ever<br/>
[runs low] or [running low] on BB Stouts?  Sometimes he will mention it to<br/>
get you started but if not just axe him about his inventory...<br/>

There is an underlying story.  Try talking to the<br/>
Clothspinner woman in<br/>
North Qeynos and delivering the note to her sister.  See<br/>
what happens after<br/>
you do.  Or actually hang out around the front gates and<br/>
listen to the<br/>
guards.  Another one will come up and start talking to the<br/>
other one and<br/>
then return where he came from.  See where he goes and look<br/>
around....<br/>
<br/>
There is more to the game than hack and slash, I assure you.<br/>

&gt; Ok, now you have me hooked.  I HATE Kithicor!  It is the<br/>
most scary place<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have been - so far.  But I keep going back!  I have had<br/>
Ged make me his<br/>
&gt; Bearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the<br/>
finest ones in all<br/>
&gt; of Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not<br/>
even with my<br/>
&gt; cha<br/>
&gt; song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is anyone keeping track of the various inter-twining of<br/>
these kind of<br/>
&gt; things?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm.<br/>
His sad story<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; woe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the<br/>
halfling in the<br/>
&gt; Hogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got<br/>
the letter and<br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; it.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you<br/>
deliver it to the<br/>
&gt; correct person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or<br/>
are these just<br/>
&gt; independent little quest things.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Finally someone else notices...I get sick<br/>
of those messages<br/>
&gt; that say<br/>
&gt; &gt;something like, &quot;We need to get rid of<br/>
useless<br/>
&gt; zones....like Kithicor&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heehee! What the &quot;Levelquest&quot; people miss in<br/>
their mad dash<br/>
&gt; to &quot;win&quot;!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I adventured there for more than a few<br/>
levels, and I still<br/>
&gt; get a kick out of<br/>
&gt; &gt;that dark place...Have you ever met<br/>
Kithicor himself?  I<br/>
&gt; saw him once by the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cabin with the grizzley bears and the flag.<br/>
He didn&#39;t say<br/>
&gt; much...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Want to hear some suspicions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Ged and his Girlfriend (not<br/>
recalling he name) are<br/>
&gt; either dead (we are talking to their<br/>
&gt; ghosts) or cursed. He (or she, likely she)<br/>
may be a<br/>
&gt; werewolf. I think they had a nice little house<br/>
&gt; in the Kithicor until it was burned down or<br/>
destroyed in<br/>
&gt; some manner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That lake, that lake *sigh* there is<br/>
something UP with it<br/>
&gt; (besides two piranha).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway we have a bunch of really weird data<br/>
points about it,<br/>
&gt; which might be random, but might NOT<br/>
&gt; be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Truth is out there<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
