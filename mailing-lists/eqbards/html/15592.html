<div id="ygrps-yiv-218451396">Sorry to hear about this Wendy.  Its amazing how few people like this it<br/>
takes to ruin GM events and make people paranoid about losing their hard won<br/>
treasures.  Glad to hear you&#39;re still upbeat after it though, doubt I would<br/>
be so charitable.  <br/>
<br/>
Another funny thing is seeing how many people won&#39;t change the subject line.<br/>
Not that you&#39;re an idiot by any stretch, just an optimist, which is a good<br/>
thing to be.  Almost makes me wish I had kept playing my original bard on<br/>
Sol Ro just so I could help you out.<br/>

Hello everyone :)<br/>
<br/>
Well I just wanted to tell you a little tale so that you can all remember<br/>
not to make my mistakes.  Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>
someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>
story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for twinking,<br/>
heh) by this guy.  <br/>
<br/>
There are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll spare<br/>
you.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never thought someone<br/>
would be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but people that do<br/>
that stuff just plain suck!<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest stuff I can<br/>
get back in one week.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>
KNOW!!!<br/>
(most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to wear the naive<br/>
banner for the week)<br/>
