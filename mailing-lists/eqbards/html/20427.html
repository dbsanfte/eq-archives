<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101387395">My favorite place to practice my Brass skills is in North Freeport. There is the underwater path for the<br/>
evil&#39;s to traverse up there...there is a ledge right past the gate in the water. Nothing goes there.<br/>

&gt; friends or selling at the auctions.  This song won&#39;t get you killed<br/>
&gt; so you can walk around NPC&#39;s and stuff ;)  Haven&#39;t tried the start<br/>
&gt; stop thing like Sylly says though.  Will have to try that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are also lots of other places where you can go to practice with<br/>
&gt; the AE&#39;s.  For instance, North Ro (mountain to the right as you are<br/>
&gt; leaving FP is a plateau), Corner of Lavastorm up from druid ring,<br/>
&gt; corner of Oasis near SRO zone (little ledge), Greater Faydark up on<br/>
&gt; the wall near Lesser Fay zone, etc.  You just got to be a little<br/>
&gt; creative ;)<br/>
