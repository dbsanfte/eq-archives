&gt; Actually, I think they &quot;fixed&quot; the easy faction in the last patch.  Meaning<br/>
&gt; of course, they made it non-existant, like they &quot;fixed&quot; brewing and baking<br/>
&gt; or whatever<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although I think that baking isn&#39;t as well implemented as the original<br/>
goal appears to be, there are still benefits to baking.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I&#39;ve been hunting in East Commonlands for the last 7 levels<br/>
or so (ok, so I&#39;m dull--but I&#39;m still gaining xp and am able to solo<br/>
fairly well) and as a side effect, I&#39;ve been just about buried under<br/>
bear, wolf, and lion meat which has a weight of 1.0 (if I remember<br/>
right) and sells for 9 cp.  A little checking and I found that the bear<br/>
and wolf meat can be turned into sandwiches with combining the meat with<br/>
bread (weight .6, I usually can buy it for 1sp3cp) and these sandwiches<br/>
(weight 0.1) can be sold to shopkeepers for around 3sp or to players for<br/>
around 5sp.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, it takes patience and you don&#39;t get the megacash return that people<br/>
seem to think that a skill requires, but I&#39;ve found that people just love<br/>
baked goods as you can carry alot more baked items for the same weight of<br/>
store bought items.  And sandwiches are easy, you max your baking skill<br/>
on them at 30 at which point you can go on to making steaks (about the<br/>
only thing I can find to do with lion meat currently) which seems to be<br/>
the next step up in baking.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have a spit to go along with my large sewing kit, I&#39;ve found<br/>
that I can make a tidy profit off of all the wolves, lions, and bears<br/>
that roam by the orc camps in EC as well as the occasional weapon and<br/>
armor off of the orcs that wander by (I don&#39;t bother with the<br/>
camps--usually too many people around them and I&#39;m frequently soloing,<br/>
anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2cp,<br/>
