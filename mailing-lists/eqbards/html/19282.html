<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661642612">I think a lot of people have got close to him now. Our guild spent a day<br/>
trying to pull his guards. On The Rathe a couple of guilds got in and<br/>
did pull them because Trak was missing from his lair that day, which is<br/>
odd to say the least unless a gm /killed him. He hits for over 600 a<br/>
swing so it will be a while before anyone manages to kill him.<br/>

&gt; Out of curiosity, has anyone fought Trakanon?  I hadn&#39;t heard anything and<br/>
&gt; wondered if Trakanon had even been located yet.  I always like to hear tales<br/>
&gt; of mobs it&#39;s highly unlikely I will ever see.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I fear I may have zoned into Dalnir when I went LD last nite from what<br/>
&gt; I heard from a friend.  Is it reasonably easy to get out of Dalnir once you<br/>
&gt; get in?<br/>
