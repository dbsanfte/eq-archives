*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last <br/>
week&#39;s big patch.  The following changes were made:<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum<br/>
or below the minimum.<br/>
- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of <br/>
the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br/>
- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified <br/>
whenever the volume slider was moved.<br/>
- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association <br/>
with mipmapping.<br/>
- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the <br/>
wrong slot.<br/>
- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those <br/>
carried by dwarves. <br/>
- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of <br/>
experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br/>
- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that <br/>
would do around one million points of damage if left to its <br/>
own devices.<br/>
- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable <br/>
by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.  <br/>
<br/>
In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up<br/>
following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god <br/>
of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name<br/>
if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing <br/>
&quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Just hope they didn&#39;t mess with invis song and sneak/hide breakage.  <br/>
If anyone gets on(I didn&#39;t), let us know anything you discover.<br/>
