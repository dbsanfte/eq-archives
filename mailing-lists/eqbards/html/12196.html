doesn&#39;t end up being worthwhile, especially when you can be slowing them<br/>
via chains or binding instead (given no enchanter or shaman).<br/>

When in an area with casters, I will tend toward Guardian and Elemental<br/>
Rhythms with drum.  The psalms don&#39;t stack with anything<br/>
resistance-related, and I love how people oggle when their MR jumps 100<br/>
points.<br/>
<br/>
I could be using weapons and a psalm, but my philosophy is if the caster<br/>
is barely scratching us anyway, it doesn&#39;t matter if it takes a few more<br/>
seconds to kill it.<br/>
<br/>
Against spiders in lower guk, I did use the psalm of purity a fair bit.<br/>
