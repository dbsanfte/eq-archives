<div id="ygrps-yiv-633039553">True.  The timer is longer than that on Harmtouch which is practically<br/>
irresistible and does far more damage, even if only to a single target.<br/>

My problem with this song is the concept.  If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate<br/>
Dirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>
once every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m<br/>
not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>
least some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant<br/>
effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>
you get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual<br/>
outcome of any fight, and is<br/>
actually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which<br/>
wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>
coupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed,<br/>
frequently without damaging them in<br/>
the slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are<br/>
laughably small compared to the<br/>
increased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>
