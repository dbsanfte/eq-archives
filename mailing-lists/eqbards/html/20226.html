&gt; &gt;And if we could convince Faras and Aloro to join the fold we would have <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the E&#39;ci bards on this list within three guilds:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in Militia these days, and we have at least 4 high-level bards.  <br/>
&gt;Myself,<br/>
&gt;Guibu, Vasen, and Valeyardb.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as we&#39;re counting E&#39;Ci bards, make sure to throw me in the pot with <br/>
the rest of them...  =8^)   I&#39;m in the Crimson Legacy guild.  I think I&#39;m <br/>
the second-highest level bard in the guild (other is a level 45-50 something <br/>
bardess that doesn&#39;t seem to be on much) and I&#39;m level 39.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my winning personality and skill (or lack thereof) as a <br/>
bard that seems to have inspired a small run of twink bards in our guild...<br/>
<br/>
BTW Kitasi, that was me that said &quot;Hey, It&#39;s Kitasi from the eqbards list!&quot; <br/>
that day in Overthere...  =8^)<br/>
