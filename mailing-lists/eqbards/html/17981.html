<br/>
Our group was asked by the 47 Shaman last night who was casting what... When<br/>
I told him AE Slow, AE DOT, and Group Battle Buff, he said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s why<br/>
Togor&#39;s won&#39;t stick.&quot;  Bug?<br/>
<br/>
We ended up letting him Togor for the Crusader and Priest and I&#39;d use<br/>
Binding for all other battles... prescribing to the theory that it&#39;s better<br/>
to have 3 or 4 mobs slowed somewhat than 1 mob slowed alot.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Binding also is useful at times<br/>
&gt; since it doesn&#39;t break snare nor mez.  It *may* prevent some<br/>
&gt; lower level slowdowns from sticking however.  But in most<br/>
&gt; cases when facing multiple mobs, slowing down 5 mobs until the<br/>
&gt; enchanter can get them mezed is more useful than slowing down<br/>
&gt; just the one mob that the group is fighting.<br/>
