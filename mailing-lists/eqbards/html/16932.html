John&#39;s statements were VERY valid general information.  Also, note his<br/>
conditional phrase:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unless the mob was snared or you were SoWed, you would&#39;ve died<br/>
&gt; regardless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are admitting that you WERE running, but you have the advantage implied<br/>
in the conditional phrase above (read SoWed as Selo&#39;d).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing a cleric as my alternate.  I take much more of a licking<br/>
running around when something is on me, than I do when I just stand there<br/>
and take a couple licks.  The reason is simple: the cleric-helper tank can<br/>
hit and taunt the mob without getting the &quot;out of range&quot; messages he&#39;d be<br/>
getting if he were having to chase the mob around.  That mob is gonna hit<br/>
you regardless (unless you cheat with strafing) -- you may as well let your<br/>
tank hit the mob while it&#39;s hitting you.<br/>
<br/>
The Root tip is a very effective tool.  No, your bard can&#39;t stun/root.  But,<br/>
it&#39;s a great tip for my cleric, who always has root memmed (we&#39;re trying to<br/>
catch up to our enchanter friend, so I&#39;m crowd control right now).<br/>
