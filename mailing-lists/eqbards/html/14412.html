<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077027011">Ugh. I play a necro and I&#39;d dump all of these spells for my old pet. Heck<br/>
are spellist is even incomplete Verant admitted this. Half the spells are<br/>
upgrades or lower level version of spells that weren&#39;t in game or that were<br/>
supposed to be in game. Besides if you really want to get cynical then fine<br/>
lets do that.<br/>
<br/>
Necro Nerfs<br/>
<br/>
- First pet nerf<br/>
- Lich nerf ( way way back before most were 50 )<br/>
- Lifetap nerf<br/>
- dot nerf<br/>
- feign nerf<br/>
- pet nerf number 2<br/>
- Pact of the shadow nerf<br/>
<br/>
Useful Enhancements<br/>
<br/>
- Mes<br/>
<br/>
The other new spells aren&#39;t in yet but they have been working on these for<br/>
awhile obviously to make necros more group friendly. The dot I&#39;m unsure of<br/>
because word from test from 50 necros are saying that it is resisted more<br/>
then the 49th darkness mob which means it probably sucks. Debuff is nice but<br/>
only useful for groups. The mana pact should be interesting but I think it<br/>
will mainly be used to cut down on Corpse Retrieval. As for the others they<br/>
are just lower level versions of spells we get already.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; To be completely cynical for a minute, I&#39;d argue that the only way to<br/>
&gt;&gt; get results from Verant is to be a whiny brat. At least that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;&gt; impression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>
&gt;&gt; other class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>
&gt;&gt; spells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>
&gt;&gt; the necros presented their case in an adult manner.<br/>
