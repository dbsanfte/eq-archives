<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005218001">Heh heh, glad I&#39;m not the only one to run into these type of guys.  E&#39;ci<br/>
does seem to proliferate them, must be dumb people have dumb friends.<br/>
Imagine my annoyance as the level 19 monk I was grouping with kept<br/>
round-kicking the monsters for 1pt for over an hour.  I asked him why he<br/>
never did anything but round-kick and he replied, cause its the only monk<br/>
attack I have.  Huh?  Don&#39;t you have other combat buttons you could switch<br/>
it to?  No, the skill never showed up.  I then realized I had never seen him<br/>
block either.  Upon asking if he ever spent any training points in them his<br/>
reply had me rofl in real life.  What are training points?  Unf***in&#39;<br/>
believable.  This guy had never spent training point one in his whole<br/>
career.  How he made it to 19th level is beyond me.  I had assumed he just<br/>
was missing since I have misses turned off, but what a shock.  No wonder he<br/>
thought monks were really difficult to beat on critters with.<br/>
WHERE do these people come from???<br/>

Roop,<br/>
I had the almost exact same thing happen to me the other day on Bristlebane.<br/>
Listen to this and I swear you will pee all over yourself.<br/>
Last weekend my cleric friend and I were in EK doing the lion/crawler/hound<br/>
shuffle when towards the end of the fight with one of these critters my<br/>
cleric friend healed himself and we hear someone shout CHEATER!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I just ignore shouts as spam and go about business as usual.<br/>
however, looking around I noticed the source of the shout was staring<br/>
directly at my cleric friend and said *Cheater* again. We&#39;re all, WTF? This<br/>
guy con&#39;d  Red as Lenin to me so, at first I was taken aback and wondered<br/>
just what he was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Yes? we ask him. Just how and what are we doing to cheat?<br/>
I was dumbfounded.<br/>
The guy says, You cast heal on yourself!<br/>
&lt;blinks&gt;<br/>
WTF you talking about, man?<br/>
The guy says, That is IMPOSSIBLE! I am a level 30 cleric and can&#39;t cast<br/>
spells in combat! You CHEATED. I get interrupted all the time so it is<br/>
IMPOSSIBLE.<br/>
&lt;blinks again&gt;<br/>
Channeling, we say.<br/>
CHANNELING? What is Channeling? he asks.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, suffice it to say Mr. Level 30 Cleric had never<br/>
heard of Channeling and had about a gazzillion practice points saved up for<br/>
that *Special Training* he apparently dreamed of spending them on.  He has<br/>
never spent a practice point in his life.<br/>
JESUS H CHRIST! Can you imagine his down time for meditating?<br/>
Yes, we did school him on training points and channeling/interruptions.  But<br/>
being the * fu**ing bitch *  (his own words) that I am, made a complete fool<br/>
out of him in the process.  I usually dont do that sort of thing because I<br/>
hate to be at the recieving end of someones ridicule as much as the next<br/>
guy, but CRIMINY! Level 30! And to boot he was being a total ass to us, and<br/>
called us Cheaters. If he would have been nice and asked how we were doing<br/>
such a WONDOROUS THING as being able to cast spells in combat, I would have<br/>
not made him feel so small.<br/>
