<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052860000">No, certainly not going to buy the armor from people, but you may have<br/>
noticed that each item requires some 200pp worth of gems to acquire.  And<br/>
certainly buying the gems from vendors is the quickest way of getting them.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I&#39;m level 28, and I have 1000 pp in the bank, just waiting <br/>
&gt;&gt;to buy a drum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Money... yuck.  Money is so worthless these days.  If I was a<br/>
&gt;non-bard class with a mistmoore battle drum I would want some<br/>
&gt;item in trade for it.  (i consider the drums ~500pp)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Of course now, that 1000pp will probably start going toward <br/>
&gt;&gt;lambent armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You gonna buy your armor from people?  Ugh.  I can feel the <br/>
&gt;value of that armor rising already.  This is just my opinion,<br/>
&gt;but I wouldn&#39;t dish out a lot of plat for these things, else<br/>
&gt;you drive the price up on the armor.  Let&#39;s face it, less than<br/>
&gt;10% of any server population is class: Bard.  It&#39;s not like<br/>
&gt;Mr. Wizard Killstealer is gonna farm up the items for the quest<br/>
&gt;and start selling off to bards for outrageous prices.  This is<br/>
&gt;one case where you can tell someone to go &#39;stuff themselves.&#39;<br/>
&gt;For crafted armor, there&#39;s always another warrior around who<br/>
&gt;needs it and will pay big money for it.  Bards are not a dime<br/>
&gt;a dozen, so sales outlets tend to be rather small.  Mr. Wizard<br/>
&gt;wont tell you, &#39;Fine I&#39;ll sell to some other bard&#39; -- cause he<br/>
&gt;ain&#39;t gonna find many others. hehe.  At level 39, I think I am<br/>
&gt;in the top 20 list now of activate bards on my server.  All the<br/>
&gt;other bards either are too low to complete the quest themselves<br/>
&gt;or too poor to foot the bill for this armor.<br/>
