Verant NEVER tells us when they nerf our abilities...I lost the invis vs<br/>
undead affect of the clouding song and nobody told me until I nearly died<br/>

Test Server Comments <br/>
Verant President John Smedley sent me the following letter that addresses<br/>
the Test Server and the recent number of complaints it has received:<br/>
 <br/>
I am somewhat surprised at the number of people that are complaining about<br/>
some changes that we have put up recently on the Test Server (namely the DoT<br/>
change and the Necro Pet change). Please understand that the Test Server is<br/>
just that... a place where we can TEST ideas we have. It absolutely does NOT<br/>
mean that the changes seen there will make there way onto the Live Servers.<br/>
Sometimes we need to try new things to see what works and what doesn&#39;t to<br/>
solve particular problems. Brad will cover this topic more in his Producer&#39;s<br/>
Letter. <br/>
