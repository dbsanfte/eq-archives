probably the the two things that spring to the top of people&#39;s<br/>
minds when they think of a bard.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It was<br/>
&gt; &gt; exhilarating because it was so non-deterministic.  All you<br/>

&gt; Go roll a bard on a PvP server or younger server.  Or like everyone else...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;ve already done all that, made those<br/>
decisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>
near-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>
treading the same ground.<br/>

The difference between playing a bard at 25-40, and playing<br/>
one at 45+ is staggering.  I don&#39;t mind that a class&#39;<br/>
strengths can change a bit as you level, but when you lose<br/>
wholesale abilitites it becomes a non-sequitor.  I&#39;m for the<br/>
most part unable to do any of the things that made the bard<br/>
fun in the mid-levels.  (I&#39;d say more, but then this would<br/>
turn into a gripe against level and class based systems...)<br/>
