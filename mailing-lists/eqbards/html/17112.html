decisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>
near-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>

The difference between playing a bard at 25-40, and playing<br/>
one at 45+ is staggering.  I don&#39;t mind that a class&#39;<br/>
strengths can change a bit as you level, but when you lose<br/>
wholesale abilitites it becomes a non-sequitor.  I&#39;m for the<br/>
most part unable to do any of the things that made the bard<br/>
fun in the mid-levels.  (I&#39;d say more, but then this would<br/>
turn into a gripe against level and class based systems...)<br/>
