&gt; One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt; forehead.<br/>
&gt; It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt; This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt; question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
&gt; abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt; had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt; (Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
&gt; would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
&gt; a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
