<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002844790">Tried using Carillion with a flute last night, no additional effect could be<br/>
seen.  There might have been one, but it was slight if so, none of the<br/>
thirty or so groups I tried it on showed any change.  Anyone see a change in<br/>
any other targeted instrument songs?<br/>
<br/>
Also, did anyone else notice that their own footsteps increased in volume by<br/>
about a factor of 10 with the patch?  I had to turn the sound down so that<br/>
environment noises like the crickets in Innothoule were silent before I<br/>
could stand the sound of my own footsteps.  I still don&#39;t hear anything of<br/>
other people&#39;s/mob&#39;s footsteps.  I asked around and it seemed that about two<br/>
thirds of the people experienced something similar.  15 of us in Steamfont<br/>
/bugged it for sure.<br/>
