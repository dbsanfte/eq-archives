<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298051850">Folks, I think there&#39;s a lot of unnecessary worrying about this new policy.  <br/>
Remember, Verant did NOT say &quot;Anyone has a right to come in and take your <br/>
spawn, and guides will enforce this&quot;, they said &quot;Everyone has the right to <br/>
equal access to spawns.&quot;  Thus you have Group A at the Lord Room and Group B <br/>
saunters up and demands their fair share.  Group A says, &quot;We have a list to <br/>
get in.  You&#39;re all on the list now.  Wait your turns please, just like <br/>
everyone else.&quot;  It&#39;s my understanding that guides would NOT force any <br/>
change from this procedure because that is sharing - the guides would <br/>
intercede if people had no way to gain access to a spawn because (e.g.) a <br/>
guild was camping it to farm an item and everyone who left was replaced with <br/>
another guild member.<br/>
<br/>
Another point: speaking only for E&#39;ci, I was in Lower Guk the other night <br/>
and there was a lot of discussion ooc about this.  The unanimous zone <br/>
consensus (no dissent was voiced in any case)?  If anyone ever tries to walk <br/>
in and &quot;steal&quot; a spawn (i.e. Group B in above example) the members of Group <br/>
B will quickly find they don&#39;t get invited into any more groups, as we as a <br/>
server don&#39;t want to deal with that kind of BS.  The folks in group A are <br/>
requested to shout to the zone the names of the jerks who are trying to <br/>
muscle in on their camp, and who don&#39;t have the maturity and respect to wait <br/>
just like everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I think this policy has some potential to help, in those cases where people <br/>
are truly unreasonable and don&#39;t want to give you any chance at a spawn <br/>
until their guild / friends have all had a chance.  This DOES happen, and <br/>
it&#39;s wrong.  The &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy will be effective as a means of <br/>
preventing a group from saying, &quot;Sure, we only have 3 people, but we don&#39;t <br/>
want any more now cause our buddies will be online in 4 horus and we&#39;re <br/>
turning this spot over to them so we can all get the Item of K3wlness&quot;.  I <br/>
think it will be applied very sparingly, and by and large will have little <br/>
to no impact on most of us.<br/>
<br/>
/split 0 0 0 2<br/>
<br/>
(there&#39;s my 2 cents)<br/>
