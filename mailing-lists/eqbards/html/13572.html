&gt; &gt; The reason for putting a fast weapon in your primary is to<br/>
&gt; &gt; raise dual wield skill - a 10 delay weapon would give 60 dual<br/>
&gt; &gt; wield checks (and thus chances to improve) every minute.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100 delay weapon would only give 6 checks.  If your skill is<br/>
&gt; &gt; maxed, this is a non-issue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (For those of you who remember, the disagreement JM and I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; over this was a matter of definition - he was using dam/delay<br/>
&gt; &gt; ratio, I was using average damage over time.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought you both agreed that dual weild checks were based on the<br/>
&gt; secondary weapon delay. Have you now changed your mind on this? If the<br/>
&gt; check happens when the secondary weapon delay expires then that<br/>
&gt; contradicts the first sentance I quoted above.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Arrrgh.  It&#39;s *not* a contradiction - that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying<br/>
explain.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of argument, say the listed dam/delay ratio is<br/>
what you actually get.  Say you&#39;re comparing a 6 damage 20<br/>
delay weapon with a 12 damage 40 delay weapon (both with a 0.3<br/>
ratio).  Say the average damage is half the max damage.<br/>
<br/>
Both weapons in the primary hand:<br/>
<br/>
6/20 weapon swings 50 times.  Avg total damage = (6/2)*50 =<br/>
150.<br/>
<br/>
12/40 weapon swings 25 times.  Avg total damage = (12/2)*25 =<br/>
150.<br/>
<br/>
Say dual wield succeeds 40% of the time.  Both weapons in<br/>
secondary hand:<br/>
<br/>
6/20 weapon swings 50*0.4 = 20 times.  Avg total damage =<br/>
(6/2)*20 = 60.<br/>
<br/>
12/40 weapon swings 25*0.4 = 10 times.  Avg total damage =<br/>
(12/2)*10 = 60.<br/>
<br/>
So the fast weapon gets 20 dual wield skill checks vs 10 for<br/>
the slower, which makes it great if you&#39;re trying to raise DW.  <br/>
But in terms of average damage, there is still no difference.  <br/>
If weapon A is better than weapon B in your primary hand, it<br/>
is better in your secondary.  If the two are equal in your<br/>
primary, they will still be equal in your secondary.  The<br/>
greater number of dual wield checks with a faster weapon is<br/>
exactly canceled out by the greater damage of the slower<br/>
weapon (assuming comparable weapons).<br/>
<br/>
The disagreement between JM and me was because of me using the<br/>
term &quot;avg dam/delay.&quot;  By putting the &quot;avg&quot; in there, I meant<br/>
the real average damage the weapon generated - what you&#39;d get<br/>
from running a parser on your log file (which didn&#39;t exist<br/>
then).  He read the &quot;dam/delay&quot; part and thought I meant the<br/>
damage and delay stats listed in the weapon description.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, with the typical fight, putting a 10 delay weapon in either hand<br/>
&gt; with a bard at high levels, assuming an under one minute fight, would<br/>
&gt; probably yeild something like this, assuming all 6 dual weild checks<br/>
&gt; succeeded (ya right)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At least that&#39;s how most of my fights looked. Given the clumpiness of<br/>
&gt; the random rolls I&#39;d rather have a lot more chances for hits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, a slower weapon generates clumpier data (though the<br/>
average remains the same).  But we weren&#39;t comparing a slow<br/>
weapon vs. a fast weapon.  What we were looking at is given<br/>
you will be using two weapons - A in primary B in secondary,<br/>
or B in primary A in secondary - does speed of the weapon<br/>
matter?  It doesn&#39;t.  The better weapon should go in your<br/>
primary.<br/>
