&gt; fyi the stats on singing steel greaves are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AC 24 8str 8sta 8agi 8cha Effect: *drum roll* Summon Food<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; nice stats and AC, but gimme a break on the effect (i may be wrong on the<br/>
&gt; stats, but the AC is right and there are defeinitely 3 or 4 stats +8).<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; cobalt (warrior) greaves have effect: invisibility on top of phenomenal AC<br/>
&gt; and stats.  what a novel thought, give a class something they don&#39;t<br/>
normally<br/>
&gt; have and something they would absolutely love!  i mean so far the AC on<br/>
&gt; singing steel is better than all imbrued pieces, and seems all classes<br/>
&gt; gloves/boots/arms/bracers will have an effect and good AC but no stats,<br/>
&gt; while the legs all have stats.   and most likely the BP when someone<br/>
&gt; eventually finds one, supposedly all having effect: gate, something no<br/>
melee<br/>
&gt; class gets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shada<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. no i didn&#39;t get the greaves, but i did get an RBB =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; boots and gloves<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so powerful that they made the AC lower.<br/>
