<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401393575">Something you say?? Based on the history of Verant and our class.  I think you understated the problem.  I will never forget the great falling of 99 when they messed with spell chaincasting and bard song would not refresh.  Ohh how many bards fell to their deaths that day.   If anyone manages to get on and test please let us know how it goes.  <br/>
<br/>
My personal pet peeve here is they should post what songs no longer stack it&#39;s not like there is anyway we can know what the did not intend for us to do, and I would prefer not to die because I suddenly can&#39;t twist verses of celerity and chant of battle.  Okay I wouldn&#39;t die but you folk know what I mean.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Why does this make my blood run cold?<br/>
&gt; &gt; ** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - We&#39;ve been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most part the<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack<br/>
&gt; &gt; that were never<br/>
&gt; &gt; intended to stack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, this is nice although I don&#39;t charm as<br/>
&gt; &gt; much as I used to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from<br/>
&gt; &gt; 12 seconds.<br/>
