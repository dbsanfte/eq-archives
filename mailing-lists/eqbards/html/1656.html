<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781068777">The bard helps all of the party.  The mobs hate anyone helping anyone they<br/>
are fighting.  So, you are going to be number one on their hit list.  Also,<br/>
your hp is lower than the tanks.  So a given amount of damage to you will be<br/>
a higher percentage of your total hp than the same amount applied to a tank.<br/>
All of the mobs will want to hit you and maybe the one other party member<br/>
who is hitting them.  So, the tanks will be fighting one mob while you will<br/>
be fighting all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Get some things (rings, etc.) to add dex so that you can dodge more hits.<br/>
Try to get your party to attack fewer mobs at one time - I know sometimes<br/>
they all get pulled in - but sometimes a cleric can lull a few while you<br/>
pull the other one or two away.  The party can gang the one or two then come<br/>
back for the lulled ones.<br/>
<br/>
Are you guys all attacking the same mob and ganging the toughest one first?<br/>
It&#39;s hard to get party members to follow even simple tactics but learning to<br/>
use the assist command will really help.  <br/>

		I&#39;m only 14th level and with deadlines for my graduate<br/>
thesis quickly<br/>
		approaching, it may be a long time before I get the chance<br/>
to discover the<br/>
		answer to these questions for myself so I&#39;m gonna go ahead<br/>
and ask them now.<br/>
<br/>
		Everyone knows the bard is #1 on the hit list for enemy<br/>
creatures.  In my<br/>
		most recent skirmishes with the Dervish Cutthroats, I<br/>
continually found<br/>
		myself taking the brunt of the damage even though there were<br/>
tanks in the<br/>
		group.  Even when I tried to back up and quit attacking due<br/>
to low health<br/>
		the cutthroats continued to attack me even though I was<br/>
doing no damage to<br/>
		them.  The end result is that I ended up dying a couple of<br/>
times when other<br/>
		members of my group ended up taking either zero or little<br/>
damage in the<br/>
		fight.<br/>
<br/>
		I am hoping that when I gain the ability to sing the Lullaby<br/>
and<br/>
		Invisibility song my survivability rate will vastly improve.<br/>
Here is how I<br/>
		assume they work so would like confirmation if my<br/>
assumptions are correct.<br/>
<br/>
		For the Lullaby, if I am getting attacked by more than one<br/>
creature, I<br/>
		assume that I will be able to sing the Lullaby while in<br/>
combat, put them to<br/>
		sleep, and then either attack them one at a time or gain<br/>
enough time so I<br/>
		can safely run away (I know this is cowardly but hey in the<br/>
end you got to<br/>
		look out for your own well-being:-)  <br/>
<br/>
		For the Invisibility song, I assume that if I turn off the<br/>
AutoAttack, start<br/>
		singing the song, then I and the rest of the party will<br/>
become invisible.<br/>
		Party members who continue to attack the creatures will<br/>
become visible upon<br/>
		their next attack.  If I continue to sing the song and never<br/>
attack again, I<br/>
		assume that I will be safe for the duration of the combat.<br/>
This all assumes<br/>
		that the creatures I am fighting can&#39;t detect invisibility.<br/>
Also, if I am<br/>
		singing the Invisibility song and not attacking the<br/>
creatures, and then<br/>
		start twisting a song that benefits the party like Hymn or<br/>
Anthem, will I<br/>
		stay invisible.  <br/>
<br/>
		Thanks <br/>
