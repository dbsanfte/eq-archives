<div id="ygrps-yiv-472999052"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m beginning to think soloing may be good for me for the time being.<br/>
&gt; Someone mentioned soloing the aviaks in Rathe Mountains as an option.  Does<br/>
&gt; anyone have any other recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The aviaks are probably the ones in Lake Rathe, though I could be wrong.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think there are aviaks in Rathe Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
At level 24, I was killing gargoyles in the ocean of tears, but depending on<br/>
your server that area could be pretty crowded right now.   You can definately<br/>
solo them at 24 though.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re starting to get into the dark days of soloing though, as monsters really<br/>
tend to hit hard at this level, you don&#39;t do much damage, and you don&#39;t have the<br/>
two big mid-range bard power/solo songs, Angstich&#39;s Appalling Screech and<br/>
Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to solo, look to the aviaks and gargoyles.  If it were me though,<br/>
I&#39;d head to Cazic Thule and try to join a group.  Great exp, really fantastic<br/>
loot and lots of action.  Groups there like having bards too, as lullaby and<br/>
hymn are very potent there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
