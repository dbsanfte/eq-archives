<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963371805">A Cantana is a Cantata sung in a Cantina.  Or maybe it&#39;s just a<br/>
pronunciation difference, like the people known as the Celts and the team<br/>
known as the Boston Celts.  So then it&#39;s more like &quot;Cantana - LIVE! Sunday<br/>
Sunday Sunday - only in the Qeynos Coliseum!&quot;  That makes is musically<br/>
related... Right?<br/>

LOL!!!<br/>

Sunday Sunday Sunday - it&#39;s the monster-bard jam-a-thon!  See the amazing<br/>
Twinkie bellow his way through 14 levels of baddies!  Watch as Uberbard<br/>
rattles his tambourine for 48 hours straight!  Be there as hordes of pickup<br/>
groups put survival skills to the test when they take on the legendary<br/>
Casualplayer wearing nothing but banded!  Only at the Qeynos Coliseum!<br/>
<br/>
Heh<br/>
