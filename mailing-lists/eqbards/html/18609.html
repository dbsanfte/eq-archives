<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394035214">While I understand the point you&#39;re making, it seems odd that someone in a<br/>
larger, less-friendly guild would be more inclinded to trust another player<br/>
to the death or consent them to move a corpse.  Part of the reason I joined<br/>
a smaller, friendlier guild was so that my rogue (who&#39;s my other primary<br/>
character) could group with people who&#39;d trust me not to steal their loot.<br/>
In a larger guild it would take forever to build up trust.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I can understand the concern for having people you <br/>
&gt; trust to know how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play their chars and not &quot;ninja-loot&quot;.  But unless I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; missing something -<br/>
&gt; &gt; this concept is what causes people in smaller guilds to complain of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;uber-guilds&quot; and &quot;Character Stealing&quot;.  Is it TRULY <br/>
&gt; necessary to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; single guild complete these events?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I look on the high end eq game like a team sport for gaming geeks, and<br/>
&gt; like most team sports, it requires the kind of people who can <br/>
&gt; put aside<br/>
&gt; problems they may have with other people on the team in favor of the<br/>
&gt; larger goal. In general, I think the kinds of people who are attracted<br/>
&gt; to small guilds because &quot;we only invite people everyone <br/>
&gt; likes&quot; are less<br/>
&gt; inclined to be able to play this way, while those that end up joining<br/>
&gt; larger guilds aren&#39;t. Planes and dragon raids (and dungeon raids in<br/>
&gt; Kunark to a large extent) require a lot of trust in the other <br/>
&gt; people, as<br/>
&gt; you will often have to consent someone else to move your corpse. They<br/>
&gt; also require a willingness to follow directions from whoever is the<br/>
&gt; leader, sometimes in spite of any opinion you might have that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; totally the wrong thing to be doing.  With a collection of smaller<br/>
&gt; guilds, this is a lot more difficult to manage.  The only way I could<br/>
&gt; see this happening is for a group of small guilds to work up to it and<br/>
&gt; try to build the trust and teamwork, maybe starting with <br/>
&gt; Kedge raids or<br/>
&gt; some of the easier dungeons in Kunark, which are empty enough <br/>
&gt; that they<br/>
&gt; give you lots of practice working as a team to clear <br/>
&gt; unfamiliar ground.<br/>
