<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758277113">Why can you not camp once the mob is off you? surely you can&#39;t take a<br/>
faction hit if you&#39;re not logged on? Pulling in PoG is a breeze when you<br/>
have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW or better, and<br/>
the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush unharmed (or<br/>
dead).<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve been either snared<br/>
or rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly being able to<br/>
*break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>
has everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement hindrances such<br/>
as these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or snare from a long<br/>
distance caster?</div>
