<div id="ygrps-yiv-774533025">hi all,<br/>
i am sure you noticed the new changes to chardok. yesterday evening i was<br/>
there with a guild group and it was a blast. we camped the exit corridor and<br/>
cleared the whole gate. the seargent spawed frequently and dropped various<br/>
very good items, also a bard-only blunt weapon Di┬┤Zok Wristsnapper 10/18 Ac5<br/>
cha/int/agi 7 wt1.5. very nice! also got 4 blues in 3,5 hours hunting there<br/>
level 52. i was cc and had no big problems even with 3 pulls, mezzing and<br/>
charming.<br/>
so now i am planning to go there more often. its much more fun than vl and<br/>
great loot also.<br/>
if you have any more information on the new chardok plz mail.<br/>
<br/>
cheer<br/>
