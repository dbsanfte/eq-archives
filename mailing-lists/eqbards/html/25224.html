<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002059398">I just picked up a bronze katana in the Warrens, and I love the way it<br/>
looks. Problem is, it&#39;s a really crappy weapon, so actually using it<br/>
isn&#39;t an option. Are there any other katanas out there that I could get<br/>
myself? How much would they cost me, or how hard would they be to get<br/>
for myself as an 11 bard? (or a 35 cleric, though I&#39;d rather not twink)<br/>
I really would love to have the katana look without the shitty<br/>
damage/delay of the one I have.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t ask me, that&#39;s just how my mind works&quot;</div>
