 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I love to solve puzzles too, but don&#39;t even bother in<br/>
EQ.  Even if it is broken, usually your reward isn&#39;t enough to<br/>
justify the time and effort.  Some guy did the Grimrot quest,<br/>
turned in the opal scythe (a 15/48 weapon that procs) and got<br/>
a nonmagical morningstar for a reward.<br/>
