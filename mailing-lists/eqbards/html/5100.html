&gt; in the chance that the MOB will resist some or all of the effect. All I know<br/>

be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>
of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>
this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>
how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>
this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>
instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>
a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>
tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>
on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>
to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>
frustrating.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Brad may be the lead designer, but I&#39;d trust the folks<br/>
who do the coding to know better how it works.  GZ (the guy<br/>
handles most of the spell effects coding) has stated that<br/>
charisma does affect the effectiveness of charm, mesmerize,<br/>
and memory blur.  For things like mesmerize and memory blur,<br/>
either it works or it doesn&#39;t - there&#39;s nothing for charisma<br/>
to modify *except* resist rate.<br/>
