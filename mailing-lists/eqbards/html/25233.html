<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336181972">It is definitely a twink weapon.  The only one I have seen was on a<br/>
twink, and it does look awesome.  And I think the low delay cap is just<br/>
a rumor, refuted by tests.  No not my tests I am too lazy, just from<br/>
what I have read.<br/>

I think it is trash.  5dmg?  That&#39;s pathetic.  The haste is irrelevant<br/>
as<br/>
you can only have one haste item and one haste &quot;spell&quot; at any given<br/>
time.<br/>
5dmg is dreadfully low and there is a limit as to how low, even with<br/>
haste,<br/>
the dly on a weapon can be.  Max haste isnt that hard to get, and 5/24<br/>
is<br/>
rotten, jade mace 9/18 less than 10k on my server and I am sure lots<br/>
cheaper<br/>
on others.  If you are just looking for the looks then maybe you will be<br/>
happy with it.  But as a weapon for anyone high enough to actually group<br/>
and<br/>
get it.  You probably already have better.  <br/>
