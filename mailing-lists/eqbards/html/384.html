<b>Subject:</b> Is Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrilion Lucky? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281016681">I just acquired Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carrilion, and after reading all the<br/>
discussion here, I decided to work on improving my skill with the song to<br/>
see if that made it more effective.<br/>
<br/>
Since I had taken the boat to Freeport to buy the song, I started practicing<br/>
it while fishing and waiting for the boat back.  It failed very often, more<br/>
often than any song I&#39;ve had so far...I assume this means that it takes a<br/>
lot of practice to get good at it.  By the time I reached ButcherBlock it<br/>
was failing less often so I guess I have improved at it.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing I noticed most was that I caught at least 3 times as many fish<br/>
as I have ever caught before, with any character, while taking the boat!<br/>
<br/>
I realize that this may be a statistical fluke, so I am asking everyone else<br/>
to test this effect whenever they get a chance.  I know that I am going to<br/>
try singing every time I loot a corpse, to see if it will improve my yield.<br/>
