Shoulders:  Tattered Mantle (Gullerback in Burning Woods)<br/>

Waist:  Belt of Concordance (Plane of Sky drop)<br/>

Arm:  SS and Imbrued<br/>
Hands:  SS and Imbrued<br/>
Feet:  SS and Imbrued<br/>
Legs:  SS and Imbrued<br/>
Chest:  Imbrued and Stonewood Mail (Plane of Growth)<br/>
<br/>
Weapons:<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this helps much, a lot of this stuff is Planar/Dragon.  But may give you an idea of what<br/>
you can shoot for.  Get to the Planes, it&#39;s a nice improvement.<br/>

&gt; midst of a merger, they enforced our 40mb limit on mailbox sizes and yes, I<br/>
&gt; admit it, I trashed my store of eqbards mails ... bad me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, what I would like to know is what you high level bards are wearing<br/>
&gt; and weilding .. the weapons/instruments you actually use up into the<br/>
&gt; mid-high 50s.  I&#39;d also like to know if you feel like it, where I can get<br/>
&gt; these items .. yes I can look them up but feeling lazy today!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As soon as Halana hits 59 (I&#39;ve given up on 60), I&#39;m going to start focusing<br/>
&gt; on BRD.<br/>
