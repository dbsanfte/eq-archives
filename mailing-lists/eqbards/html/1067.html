Up to 110 against apprehensive merchants makes a difference -<br/>
I tested it with a bunch of characters in increments of 5 chr.<br/>
<br/>
I also know it makes a difference with gypsies.  I got my<br/>
combine longsword for 52.5pp.  I&#39;ve only heard of one other<br/>
person getting that price, and he either had 105 chr or 105<br/>
+5 from the amulet.  I also heard someone saying his shaman<br/>
friend cast spirit of the snake (a +chr buff) on his bard and<br/>
he was able to buy a well-balanced longsword for 227pp.  The<br/>
vendor quotes me 223pp at 110 chr.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to test it against these two when I get back to<br/>
Freeport.<br/>
