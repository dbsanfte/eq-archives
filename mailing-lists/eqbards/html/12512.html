<div id="ygrps-yiv-792353547">It is a bug of a sort. Here is what happens: Lets say a quest requires 3 <br/>
items (X, Y, & Z).  Player 1 gives the NPC items X, Y, and a third item that <br/>
is incorrect. Swears up & down at his bad fortune and stomps off.  Player 2 <br/>
comes up and gives the NPC item Z and gets the goods, and since she also <br/>
gave the NPC items X & Y gets the &quot;you have something else for me?&quot; message.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I completed the lambent breastplate quest the other day.  When I gave the<br/>
&gt;quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate, faction change<br/>
&gt;messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on the next line <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting<br/>
&gt;something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key word/phrase.  I<br/>
&gt;tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot; but got no <br/>
&gt;further<br/>
&gt;response from her.  Was wondering if this was just a bug or if there might<br/>
&gt;possibly something else I could have given her?<br/>
