<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-805285406">Does anyone know who I can write/talk to if my GM hasn&#39;t responded to me in<br/>
three weeks?  Some of you may remember that I had a lore container poof with<br/>
some items that didn&#39;t belong to me.  Our head GM asked me to write her an<br/>
email.. which I did.  After not hearing from her in three days I wrote<br/>
another and still have heard nothing.  I petition regularly when I&#39;m online<br/>
but the only resopnse I get is &quot;I&#39;m sure Kyrani will get to it.&quot;  Well, I<br/>
think I&#39;ve been patient but perhaps I&#39;m not giving them enough time.  And if<br/>
she doesn&#39;t respond, is there anywhere else to appeal?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
