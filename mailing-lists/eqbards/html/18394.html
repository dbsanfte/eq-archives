Subject: [eqbards] ROK city<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have a couple of questions about the city (Firona Vie or whatever).<br/>
&gt; Is there a bank?<br/>
<br/>
* Yes *  And talk to the guy banker - he talks about giving you something &quot;a<br/>
composer&quot; left with him.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is there a merchant who sells lower level bard songs?<br/>
<br/>
* Not that I have found nor heard of. *<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I found the guy who sells the 51+ songs (any reason they are cheaper<br/>
&gt; than my lvl 25+ songs?).<br/>
<br/>
* Heh - no clue. New guy priced them and did not look at old songs?  who<br/>
knows *<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I saw the bard trainer thread, and saw no<br/>
&gt; replies, so I&#39;ll assume thats a no (Eh, who cares about hide and safe<br/>
&gt; fall?).<br/>
<br/>
* Not that I have found nor heard of. *  Anyhow, travel is not that hard.<br/>
And if you go back for songs - train then.  Safefall you will want to have<br/>
and prolly worth it to do some work to max it. Also, hide is one I<br/>
neglected.  Trouble is that you need to con something to know if it worked<br/>
and its capped low so its not as good (not even close) to rogues.  Might<br/>
have been different if I knew how it worked and maxxed it early. Later on,<br/>
you can buy your skills up as I probably will.  Although that wastes<br/>
training points - hmm oh well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well so far its an intersting place.  I can&#39;t believe how big the agro<br/>
&gt; radius on most of these things, but I can run fast :)<br/>
<br/>
* Heh * And I was thinking that the agro radius is pretty small or there is<br/>
some delay.  Stuff that should agro, I can run by fairly close.  Stuff that<br/>
does agro, I can out run pretty easily.  I love my bard!<br/>
