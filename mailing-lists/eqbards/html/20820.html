<div id="ygrps-yiv-835978274">In well over 2 played days in kedge, I have never seen coralyn spawn, much<br/>
less spawn with the drum.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, the tamborine is no drop, has +5 int (not super useful, but<br/>
better than no int) and is slightly better in terms of song boost than the<br/>
sharskin.<br/>
<br/>
The coins are all droppable and most are fairly easy to get.<br/>
<br/>
Overthere, dropped off of the scropikis scroungers I zoned in, found one in<br/>
less than 5 min, killed it solo at 39 and left. Piece of cake, although<br/>
sometimes they are as easy to get. Scropiki are not able to see through<br/>
invis, so you can walk around there all you like. The scroungers are Sks, so<br/>
keep it in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Kaesora, dropped off of the failed crypt raider. People have had mixed<br/>
results getting this coin. On my server, he spawns every other spawn cycle,<br/>
so if you clear the library area once, you&#39;ll prolly see him on the respawn.<br/>
The library area can be easily done with a group of 35s and the exp in<br/>
kaesora is bar none best I&#39;ve seen in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Emerald Jungle, foraged. You&#39;ll need help with this one. Just spend a night<br/>
hunting the denziens there and you should walk away with a coin.<br/>
<br/>
City of Mist, dropped off of the Captain of the Guard. The zone to CoM can<br/>
be done by a high 30s group without too much trouble. The CotG usually<br/>
spawns just past the bridge to the right or the left and he&#39;s fairly common.<br/>
We camped there for 3 hours and saw 3 or 4 captains.<br/>
<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen, dropped off Bloodgill goblins. I was lucky enough to<br/>
purchase this coin off of a vendor for a mere 5 s, so I have no idea how<br/>
hard this one is to get. The gobs are mid 30s and hit hard, they are also a<br/>
pain because they spawn in the water, so you&#39;ll need to be in the water to<br/>
fight them.<br/>
<br/>
Dalnir, dropped off of the Kly Imprecator. The Imp is an easy camp for a mid<br/>
to high 30s group, but he doesn&#39;t show that often. I recommend doing the Imp<br/>
on the second floor, as opposed to the one in the church on the third floor.<br/>
The second floor one seems to spawn much more frequently.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Magical drums?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quick question, what lev i need to be to get the nostrolo drum (my bard is<br/>
37)? or is it simpler to just go to kedge with a 52+ group and go find the<br/>
sharkskin drum? which of the 2 drums seems better (since i dont think i&#39;ll<br/>
ever get my hands on a selo&#39;s drum since the damn dragon patch)<br/>
<br/>
 Some guildmates were camping Phinigan for xp, kinda sad when his guards<br/>
wont even aggro when ya pull him... so i figure if they&#39;re going to kedge<br/>
for xp, i might as well hop along and hope to get a drum<br/>
<br/>
