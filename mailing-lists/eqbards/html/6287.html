<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878650537">they fixed this back in beta.  any damage at all, like from our AE damage<br/>
songs, will wake up lullabied mobs.  before they fixed it, i heard a rumor<br/>
that a couple bards went down to guk (not sure if upper or lower) and one<br/>
sang lullaby and the other DDD and got like 10 levels in one day hehe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; One tactic I had hoped would be effective was using lullaby <br/>
&gt; with CoD and<br/>
&gt; the L48 song, but lullaby has no discernable effect on PC <br/>
&gt; chars at all.<br/>
&gt; This combo doesn&#39;t even seem to work all that well on mobs, which is<br/>
&gt; really too bad as nodding them off while your dots kill them <br/>
&gt; would be a<br/>
&gt; nasty way to do them in. </span></blockquote></div>
