Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>
or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>
as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
<br/>
Strategies:<br/>
<br/>
- Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of<br/>
  the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.<br/>
<br/>
- This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and<br/>
  Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn&#39;t work through walls<br/>
  anymore.  Once you&#39;re dragged up, you have walls on both sides so<br/>
  you won&#39;t teleport anywhere.  Still, it&#39;s worth a shot, especially<br/>
  if you&#39;re not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure<br/>
  you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.<br/>
<br/>
- It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far<br/>
  enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone<br/>
  without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to<br/>
  start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same<br/>
  thing.<br/>
<br/>
Cautions:<br/>
<br/>
- A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since everyone<br/>
  teleports to different locations.  Of course if that&#39;s your intent...<br/>
<br/>
- Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I&#39;ve teleported right<br/>
  into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying<br/>
  to get a friend unstuck.<br/>
<br/>
- The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>
  means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>
  easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>
  make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water.<br/>
