<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798031003">Hehe- I found my lev 30_+ caster fiends retrieving their corpses from the<br/>
ogres one day.  Our enchanter fiend could cast Ogre form and walk in and<br/>
drag corpses out.  I did the same thing and saw amiable and being a bard<br/>
thought np ill buzz right on by...<br/>
<br/>
you writhe in agony<br/>
you writhe in agony<br/>
Loading, please wait...<br/>
<br/>
Then some time I helped a mage get his corpse from somewhere near that place<br/>
and dint think much of it.  But yesterday I get a tell from him and he axes<br/>
&quot;do you remember me?&quot; Well, he says he&#39;s gonna camp these ogers and would I<br/>
like some loots? Oh ya, he&#39;s a lev 48 magician.  So, I go watch him do his<br/>
stuff.  He says they are all green to him but like all of us, he hates green<br/>
casters with a passion.  He and his pet get the spawn broken out and then<br/>
for the next 2 plus hours we camp.  He wants some earring and some veil they<br/>
drop. He lets me loot the rest of the stuffs.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s got a hp-to-mana spell he casts on himself and I am busy healing<br/>
between fites. Pet does most of the work and can solo guards if they are<br/>
dumb enuff to charge him while he meds.  He can stand off and cast them fire<br/>
ball looking spells into the melee.  Eventually , I get brave enough to<br/>
bellow from the edge of the melee and taunt their pets off _our_ pet.<br/>
Chief&#39;s dog is a nasty yeller but cant make up his mind who to attack - esp<br/>
if our pet is whacking the Chief.  The shapersons and the chief drop the<br/>
good loots - rest of them drop rusty, misc large leather armor, misc bronze<br/>
wep and fs wep, occasion 2-3plat, mostly few gp or sp, various words pages<br/>
and ruins.  The sha and chief dropped some bone armor - legs and arms.  Have<br/>
lowish ac and weight compared to bronze and have str and sta boosts with agi<br/>
and dex penalties - only an oger would be dumb enough to make armor like<br/>
this.  But casters can wear it.<br/>
<br/>
He (his pet) killed the Chief mucho times.  There is a priest(ess?) that<br/>
never spawned during our camp.  At one time, I think he got kinda sleepy<br/>
waiting and the camp started to fill up. I got nervous because he was not<br/>
attacking each one like before and not responding to tells and now the<br/>
guards and the Chief are up.  So, do I leave him to a certain death and save<br/>
myself before it&#39;s too late?? Or do I decide to get &quot;creative&quot; and think we<br/>
might be OK if I make us invis.  Well, I should know better but I did it<br/>
anyways.  Mage pets and our invis don&#39;t get along at all.  Any how - KABOOM!<br/>
his pet dies as we go invis and I guess the noise woke him up.  He attacks<br/>
the rest of the camp and clears it.  I have to fess up and explain that it<br/>
was me that schwacked his pet and he goes &quot;hehe - lol&quot;  I guess you need a<br/>
sense of humor to get to lev 48 :-)<br/>
