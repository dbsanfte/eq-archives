<br/>
Will leveling get easier?  Hmmm - yes and no.  Each level higher you get<br/>
takes more xp imho.  Some levels are by design twice as hard as regular<br/>
levels - they are called the &quot;Hell&quot; levels: 30, 35, 40 and 45 (imho 50 is<br/>
the ultimate Hell as well) but the teens are real tough for bards as well.<br/>
But it can get easier if you get into groups and if you can form a team that<br/>
plays together on a regular basis - it will be easier and more fun.  You<br/>
should find a guild that you like and that has players who play at your<br/>
level and at your same amount of time in the game.   The last time I was<br/>
able to do &quot;a level in a day&quot; was back at level 24 for me.  It was hard to<br/>
do even though I could always do it before if I set my mind to it and<br/>
endured long camps.<br/>
<br/>
But I hate camping too!  It&#39;s dull and boring for the most part.<br/>
Unfortunately, it is a pretty big part of the game as you get older.   Most<br/>
bards prefer to group and most groups will want to camp.  So, while it may<br/>
be possible to get to high levels without camping, I do think it would take<br/>
a lot longer and it would be a lot harder.  But you should play the game the<br/>
way you are happy with it and don&#39;t do stuff that you don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
So welcome and please feel free to tell us about your adventures and we are<br/>
happy to help answer your questions ;)<br/>

		I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player<br/>
(maybe a couple<br/>
		hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be<br/>
taking longer...<br/>
		Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it<br/>
take longer for<br/>
		each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each<br/>
level, but<br/>
		hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better<br/>
selection of<br/>
		mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or<br/>
harder to level<br/>
		in the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>
		Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?<br/>
I hate<br/>
		camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I<br/>
get bored and<br/>
		leave....<br/>
<br/>
		Cheers,<br/>
