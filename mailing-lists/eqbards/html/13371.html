&gt; OUCH!  Really sorry to hear about that.  Though don&#39;t feel<br/>
&gt; too bad, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all dropped our MM drum or some<br/>
&gt; other valuable weapon before.  Sucks that you couldn&#39;t<br/>

from the bard in their group a few minutes later that the<br/>
group had decided to leave.  For the next hour, there were<br/>
like 4-8 giants up at any one time - way more than my group<br/>
could kill even though I was grabbing a new one as soon as one<br/>
died (and having my group members do the looting and coin<br/>
split instead of me).  It was bad enough that I stopped<br/>
killing trash mobs.  If that&#39;s any indication, they were<br/>
killing 2-3 times more giants than we were.<br/>
