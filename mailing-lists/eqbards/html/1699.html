<b>Subject:</b> Best two spells in the game...!? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805194422">Last night I joined a big group and they came to one conclusion: Two of the<br/>
bard songs are &quot;the best&quot; spells in the game, they told me this themselves!<br/>
Why?  Because those two songs allowed them the most Fun ever in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d never guess which two of our songs they picked, rarely used.  One of<br/>
their favorites was Jig O Vigor.  Heheh, the other was Aquatic Ayre!  We<br/>
were swimming around in Oasis, fighting aqua goblins... and it was a BLAST!<br/>
I tend to agree with them: those two became my favorite songs!  Giant ogres<br/>
swimming over my head, we hadn&#39;t seen the sky in hours, many folks kept<br/>
repeating they never had so much fun in Everquest.  Neither did I!<br/>
If you&#39;re in some boring group in Oasis sitting around on the beach, suggest<br/>
everybody dive in!  You won&#39;t regret it.  Great loot from those aqua<br/>
goblins, too,<br/>
might I add!  Sold a lot of bows and leather....<br/>
<br/>
But it was a great experience, that was the reward, I must find more aquatic<br/>
places like that!  O the zone was packed and competitive, yet we had the<br/>
waters all to ourselves.  LOL, imagine someone going down there to fetch and<br/>
seeing a group with a bard in the murky depths and muttering, &quot;Damn<br/>
campers!&quot;<br/>
