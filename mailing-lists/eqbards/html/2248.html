<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187947586">What should I do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a two part solution as I am finding out. 1) go to a cash rich/exp poor dungeon like<br/>
blackburrow. At 11 don&#39;t bother with scawny gnolls but kill everything else. You can take an Elite<br/>
solo MAYBE (though without good armour maybe not) but certainly in a 2-3 person group. You will have<br/>
to make several town runs a night, oh and get a spiked collar (3ac +3 to str and something else they<br/>
sell in auction for about 1-2pp) do NOT get spiked shoulders, sure +5 to str but -10 to magic resist<br/>
*yuck*. Then when you have enough plat and as there is ZERO small banded in Qeynos (at least on<br/>
Povar) run to Faydwer and buy it there. The lower prices will be worth the run.<br/>
If you want to do it piecemeal then save a bit and go buy it (again ) in Faydwer. My tunic cost me<br/>
15 pp everything else about 9pp (haven&#39;t bought pants or cloak yet, cloak will be more).<br/>
<br/>
Those are my two cps<br/>

Zek are true.</div>
