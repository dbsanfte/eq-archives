<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111584325">No, low resolution can benefit as well.  Anything which is fill-limited<br/>
benefits.  The most obvious graphics-related lag I see is when lots of<br/>
spells are going off during melee, and that&#39;s because of all the<br/>
blending required to render the sparkles.  And for a bard, that&#39;s the<br/>
worst time to lag, as it directly affects how many songs we can twist.<br/>
<br/>
The impact of higher fill rate is most obvious at high resolution<br/>
because that&#39;s when fill rate becomes the bottleneck.  At low resolution<br/>
it may or may not be a bottleneck depending on factors including CPU<br/>
speed, scene complexity and in the case of EQ, how many spell effects<br/>
are visible at the time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you are running a PII computer and think you need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade to a PIII to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play some of these new games, I&#39;d highly recommend dropping<br/>
&gt; &gt; the $300 or so<br/>
&gt; &gt; (got my GeForce for $275) on a new video card instead and buy yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; another 6 to 9 months before your framerates start to go south.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmm, what if that PII is only a 300 w/ 64 MB RAM?  Worth getting the card or<br/>
&gt; should I stick to my original plan of buying a whole new PC this coming<br/>
&gt; winter?  &lt;sigh&gt; It&#39;s like deciding whether to keep sinking money into an<br/>
&gt; older car or buy another that you can barely afford.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I always run low res so I can open bags from keypads.  Did someone say that<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t see the improvement as much until you get up to 1024x768?  (Sorry,<br/>
&gt; deleted the message)<br/>
