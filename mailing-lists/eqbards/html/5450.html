<div id="ygrps-yiv-924389856">When we initially explored the caves, we followed the walls and saw only a <br/>
couple regular water gobs. So after making a circuit and not seeing <br/>
anything, we got real bold and went straight in. We found a tower very like <br/>
the underwater tower in Oasis. Not having found trouble yet, we swam up the <br/>
tower and bingo! deepwater goblin started burning me up. I swam away from <br/>
the tower dying so fast I was hoping only to get my corpse out of range for <br/>
recovery. My partner was swimming suddenly bereft of the water breathing <br/>
song. He actually made it out alive, took one drowning hit before making it <br/>
to air again, hehe. Fortunately I was bound to Arena. I recvoered my body <br/>
having succeeded in placing it out of the deepwater&#39;s range. The L39 paladin <br/>
from the guild who was in the area and came to make sure the adventuring <br/>
bard didn&#39;t off herself again, said the gobs con&#39;d blue to him. We thought <br/>
over some revenge but decided the gobs had us outnumbered and on their turf. <br/>
Some day, revenge will come.<br/>
Funny you should talk about Chief Dooga, when I started across the Lake <br/>
before the cave adventure, I was on my way to join guildmates camping that <br/>
very same ogre camp. At the time I was being boiled, they also got stomped <br/>
by an unpleasant mix of ogres and giants. I would have died had I followed <br/>
my original intent also. At least my way, I got to learn something new.<br/>
