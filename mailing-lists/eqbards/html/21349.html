<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843236927">Some people are hoping that Lucasarts involvement in the Star Wars product<br/>
may end up with a better product with better customer support.  I hope<br/>
they&#39;re right - but I also hoped that the weren&#39;t going to get the &quot;Broken<br/>
as intended&quot; response to lullaby testing...<br/>
<br/>
As far as EQ2 - by the time it comes out Anarchy Online, and Horizons will<br/>
hopefully be out.  So, no, it&#39;s not a forgone conclusion that my EQ friends<br/>
will be rushing to buy EQ2....<br/>

Fortunately most of my friends agree on this, so they won&#39;t be all that<br/>
interested in EQ2 either.  I have no desire to try Star Wars Online, or to<br/>
play another Verant game.  They have the worst customer service I have ever<br/>
seen and an even worse attitude towards their customers.<br/>
