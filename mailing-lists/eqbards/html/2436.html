<div id="ygrps-yiv-118920867"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Btw, odd thing about bards and Unrest and bronze armor.  Both<br/>
&gt; my cleric friends are selling all the bronze they&#39;re finding<br/>
&gt; instead of wearing it.  They say that with me around, they<br/>
&gt; almost never get attacked, and thus feel they don&#39;t need the<br/>
&gt; extra AC given the weight penalty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t call it an odd thing my friend.  In my normal adventuring group<br/>
I am as close as to a tank as we have most nights (1 bard, 2 wiz, 1 necro<br/>
and 2 clerics).  When we are in this configuration the other almost never<br/>
get attacked at all, well except for the wizard =).  Other than it is<br/>
mostly safe, but in  lesser party and some other locations they will need<br/>
it.  Perhaps I will convince them next time I am on.  Nothing was more<br/>
disheartening to me than seeing DVinn go kill crazy on my poor cleric<br/>
friend when she tried to heal me.<br/>
