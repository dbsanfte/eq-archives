&gt; I&#39;ve tried Kith about four different times now, and while I&#39;ve been in good<br/>
&gt; groups, not died, etc., the mob/hour and exp./hour ratio is pretty bad.  You<br/>
&gt; wait for a pull while playing clarity.  Some Ranger or Druid is out there<br/>
&gt; running around.  &quot;Inc!&quot; So you stand up, fight one blue/yellow/red mob and<br/>
&gt; then wait for another pull...  Then 7am rolls around and you *sit* for 20<br/>
&gt; minutes real time.  So all-in-all you might kill 5 or 6 mobs during the<br/>
&gt; night if you&#39;re lucky.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really seen my exp. move<br/>
&gt; fighting in the new Kith.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  I didn&#39;t see finding mobs as a big problem with<br/>
Kithicor.  I&#39;m usually able to keep a steady stream of mobs<br/>
for my groups to fight.  Just run out to fetch a new one<br/>
before the one you&#39;re fighting is dead.  When it becomes day,<br/>
let the paladins find undead using their sense undead spell -<br/>
it points them at the nearest undead (which doesn&#39;t work when<br/>
a necro or SK pet is nearby).<br/>
<br/>
The problem keeping up your mobs/hour ratio in Kithicor is<br/>
that the mobs are just way too tough for their level.  The<br/>
harm touches insure you&#39;re going to have at least a minute or<br/>
two of downtime after the fight.  Most of the mobs are casters<br/>
on top of that, and all can debuff or disease you, thus<br/>
requiring even more downtime.  If a party member gets feared,<br/>
half the time he&#39;s gonna die.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that it&#39;s an outdoor zone.  There are no<br/>
structured halls for people to find shelter in, so everyone<br/>
pulls to the zones.  One group screws up, and everyone on that<br/>
side has to get out.  The undead are not very particular about<br/>
who they attack either, so pulling is a problem, as is having<br/>
other people&#39;s pulls jumping on you in a tough fight.<br/>
