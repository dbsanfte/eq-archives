<div id="ygrps-yiv-89024467">hmm i ran into Dreammer.  3 of us were in the tower, and i saw the Catiff on<br/>
track so we went to check him out.  just sitting there no one around so we<br/>
killed him hehe.  immediately Dreammer starts shouting to the zone how the<br/>
high level group stole their kill and we don&#39;t need the loot or experience<br/>
from him and blah blah blah.  and this was AFTER we gave them the loot<br/>
sheesh.  he did apologize though, and asked US not to bring any trains LOL.<br/>
i didn&#39;t know HE was the famous trainmaster.<br/>
