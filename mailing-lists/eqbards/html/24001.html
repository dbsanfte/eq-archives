<div id="ygrps-yiv-856365743">Being a bard in Dalnir&#39;s is well... painful.  Unless the new agro changes<br/>
have helped I ended up dying way to much to make it worthwhile.  Especially<br/>
since at those levels you don&#39;t have the big rez capability.  There are way<br/>
too many casters in Dalnir&#39;s and that goo poison is ridiculous.  I had a few<br/>
good xp nites, but also several with no or minus gain in 4 hours.<br/>

I will, and thanks!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad bards are so rare.  I really think that any 4 people that get<br/>
lucky enough to group with 2 good bards will resort to shouting, &quot;Group of 4<br/>
looking for bards!&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to be in a group with one in Dalnir.  One of us could go<br/>
percussion, the other string.   :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Shoot me a tell sometime, if ya want.  If you&#39;re around level <br/>
&gt;30, I&#39;d love to group.  I&#39;ve always wanted to have another bard <br/>
&gt;in the group that knew enough about the songs and how to twist <br/>
&gt;to coordinate a 6 song crescendo of power that NONE CAN<br/>
&gt;WITHSTAND..MWHAHAHAHAA!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Dark may be level 32 now, yes? *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if I remember correctly, Dark is a couple of levels ahead <br/>
of me, so I would guess about 56 now.<br/>
<br/>
If you see me online, Atonal, feel free to give me a /tell.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
