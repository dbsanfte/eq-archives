<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574571514">Maybe the AI is selective in the way that it regards bard songs? Because if<br/>
a bard stands next to me and sings chords, I get the message &quot;Sillybard<br/>
tries to cast a spell on you, but you are protected.&quot; Also, if I&#39;m stunned<br/>
or sitting and try to sing a song, I get the message &quot;You must be standing<br/>
to cast a spell!/You can&#39;t cast spells while stunned!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe the behavior for charmed players is NPC while charmed - I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen a charmed mob cast spells - but then again, come to think of it, I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a casting mob charmed. Of course, I&#39;m only 17th<br/>
level, I&#39;ve never been charmed, and I believe there are many, many things I<br/>
have yet to see in EQ. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge<br/>
&gt; to somehow help us<br/>
&gt; &gt; survive a fight after we go linkdead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When charmed you are also an npc, and in all the times my bard was<br/>
&gt; charmed, which was a lot back in the days when shaman npc mobs could<br/>
&gt; charm, I never once played a song. The AI doesn&#39;t appearantly think<br/>
&gt; songs are spells. </span></blockquote></div>
