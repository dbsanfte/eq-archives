<b>Subject:</b> Re: New instrument?! The final word. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382081031">I submitted the instrument to Eqlizer yesterday and have showed it to a<br/>
few friends on Tarew Marr. It is indeed +9 dex, +15 charisma, +9 int and<br/>
does add +15% to brass music. (I did the calculations myself to see how<br/>
much it boosted song performance).<br/>
You only get the stat adjustments when you&#39;re actually using it. I&#39;ll<br/>
probably rarely use it, but its just nice to have.<br/>
Kyndra, a L25 monk on Tarew Marr got it as a loot item from a GM quest<br/>
event in Steamfont a few weeks back. I traded her my flowing black silk<br/>
sash for it. So no, it did not come from PoF.. although that could be<br/>
the original location of the item, since GMs hand out already existing<br/>
items in their quests usually.<br/>

If you still think its a hoax, log onto Tarew Marr server and send me a<br/>
tell and i&#39;ll be glad to show it to you =)<br/>
