<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862171880">Actually what he ment is if he fires up the song for only one tic,<br/>
it will heal 45hp, i beleive him.  I do that when i play mana song, will do<br/>
2 &quot;your mind clears&quot; and 1 &quot;your wounds begin to heal&quot;  that little heal<br/>
icon heals you 2 or 3 times (i forgot how many times) and each little heal<br/>
it does to you at my level is 14 i beleive, so that means im doing about<br/>
28hp per tic.  but if he&#39;s only playing heal song, then all in all, every<br/>
time a &quot;begin to heal&quot; message pops up, he&#39;s getting about 17hp or so. i<br/>
dunno if im making sense but it explains what he&#39;s saying IMO<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able to <br/>
&gt; &gt; heal 45 points <br/>
&gt; &gt; per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess found in <br/>
