<div id="ygrps-yiv-53622685">Played around with this last night.  Sense traps works just like Sense<br/>
Heading, i.e. you can use it anywhere.  So to train it up fast, I created a<br/>
macro to run it multiple times.  It looks something like this:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 100, /doability # (same macro for every line of the Social hotkey)<br/>

Sense and Disarm Traps<br/>
 <br/>
In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps,<br/>
have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some<br/>
may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br/>
being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br/>
without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br/>
crossed a zone boundary.<br/>
 <br/>
These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range<br/>
from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only<br/>
be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.  <br/>
 <br/>
Use &quot;Sense Traps&quot; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you<br/>
can then use &quot;Disarm traps&quot; to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the<br/>
trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br/>
your group passes through the area.  <br/>
 <br/>
If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br/>
directed towards the closest one.  <br/>
