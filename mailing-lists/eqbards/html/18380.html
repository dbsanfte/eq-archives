<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930848810">LOL - Pina Colata?  I think you mean Pinata (&quot;Peen-ya-ta&quot;  -- Pin~ata - with<br/>
an &quot;en-yay&quot;) but a good idea never the less.  I grew up in the southwest in<br/>
the 60&#39;s (ugh i am really old!) and we always had a Pinata at birthday<br/>
parties.   In case you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a paper mache animal figure that is<br/>
filled with candy and suspended from a cord. Each child is blindfolded and<br/>
spun about just a bit - then pointed in the general direction of the pinata<br/>
to swing at it with a mini-baseball bat.  Eventually someone makes contact<br/>
and it breaks open and scatters candy everywhere and all the kids scramble<br/>
for some.  Maybe a druid in wolfform as the pinata and all the &#39;kids&#39;<br/>
reeling from excess alcohol to simulate blindfolded - or some one who can<br/>
cast darkness is the pinata?<br/>

&gt; Hi Jeff,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is always fun.  Try different varieties of this.  Things like this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take a new Lvl 5th Warrior<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2&gt; Who can kill the warrior with one strike. Kinda like a pina colata. Win<br/>
a price if you can hit him one he dies (might have to try a lower level<br/>
character) </span></blockquote></div>
