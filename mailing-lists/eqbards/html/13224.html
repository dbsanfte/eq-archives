<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780916677">I&#39;ve seen a few posts lately about some good groups and nights.  These<br/>
are cool and tell things to look for when I&#39;m in a group (my bard<br/>
basically plays in all pickup groups right now, I play very<br/>
erractically, though this weekend was great, made almost 2 lvls!).<br/>
<br/>
Now the ugly question.  What should I look for to help me identify a bad<br/>
group.  Not having gate, its helpful to make pretty quick judments on a<br/>
group since its hard to get out sometimes (in dungeons).<br/>
<br/>
For example Monday I was with two others (enchanter and shaman) who I<br/>
had done great with the night before.  We picked up three tanks (A<br/>
uber-twinkie warrior, exec axe/crafted at lvl 17, monk and a ranger). <br/>
Playing it safe ( I thought) we were turbo pulling on orc highway (if<br/>
you dont know they are lvl 12-16ish with an occasional &quot;a orc warrior&quot;<br/>
which are like lvl 20 I think, red to me at 15).<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen minutes in (the enchant, shaman and I had been together for an<br/>
hour Monday, but a lvl 15 bard is a flimsy tank against DW caimians and<br/>
crocs).  We heard a &quot;xxxx yells for help&quot;.  All but the monk (out<br/>
pulling) get up, and see the usual.  A soloist mistakingly pulled on of<br/>
the &quot;a orc&quot;s.  We pile on, as the shaman warns the puller we have a big<br/>
fight (these are pretty rough even with a full group).  We have it<br/>
beaten down, both casters OOM, but health is fine, when I look up from<br/>
key mashing and see mine dropping.  Ugh, DB skel decided he didnt like<br/>
my music.  Three /g&#39;s of &quot;Help the bard&quot; from our shaman (he&#39;s good!<br/>
noticed my health before I did), and I am still solo on the DB down to<br/>
1.5 bubs.  Eventually the enchanter&#39;s pet manages to get the DB off<br/>
me(lucky I guess).  At which point the ranger says &quot;Anthem!&quot;.  (I assume<br/>
he finally noticed all the nifty flashing icons were off his screen, as<br/>
I was getting the crap stunned out of me).  Shaman reminds the tank that<br/>
their fair haired bard is the lowest lvl in the group and not much good<br/>
at absorbing damage.  (I tend to not say anything, so he has taken on<br/>
the role for me)<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on...  ABout half hour later, I decide to experiment with<br/>
kabonging.  With all this muscle (even the shaman out damages me with<br/>
his big hammer), I felt my damage wasn&#39;t mattering much and we might be<br/>
better served if I just use the old mandolin.  So I weave Hymm and<br/>
Chordx2 in battle (I only triple in a big fight as it gives me a<br/>
headache), with my mandolin in hand.  After a big pull (2 priests and<br/>
warriors), I am pretty well smushed (below 1 bub), so I&#39;m sitting with<br/>
Hymm going.  I watch the ranger top himself off with heals (the other<br/>
tanks were down around 2 bubs), then cast the damage shield on himself. <br/>
I tell the enchanter and shaman, &quot;Time to Jettison this trash?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In any case what are some good things to look for so I know when to bail<br/>
out?  The group I met on Sunday was great (we played about 6 hours with<br/>
0 deaths in a low-risk zone, closest call was me being saved by a rune<br/>
spell, 2 hp left!), but I think they will out level me too quickly<br/>
(which is usually my problem, any good players I meet out level me<br/>
quickly, guess I should figure out where I stand)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
