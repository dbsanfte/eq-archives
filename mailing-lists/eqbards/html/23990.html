<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491030897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;um wrong, common error.  the 4% is out of 2000 people playing at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the time. the 7% was out of 38000 or so people playing at the time.  <br/>
percentages are hard numbers if you relate them to the same or <br/>
comparable things.  In this case both are related to the number of <br/>
people playing at a specific time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Um, duh.  The common error here is that you are relating 4% bards <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to being the same as 7% pvp.  If there were only two classes to <br/>
choose from then your analogy would be appropriate.  Since there are <br/>
13 other choices however, it is not.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming all classes were equally played, you&#39;d expect each class to <br/>
be equally represented at 6.67%.  If Bards account for 4%, they&#39;re <br/>
below average, but not significantly below average.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming PVP and PVE were equally played, you&#39;d expect each type of <br/>
server to be equally represented at 50%.  If PVP accounts for 7%, <br/>
they&#39;re significantly below average.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;no, we&#39;re talking about the big picture here.  just because there <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are more choices doesn&#39;t make one minority any less significant than <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Totally and completely untrue.  The number of choices directly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>affects the significance of any minority percentage.  This is true <br/>
both statistically, analytically, and practically.<br/>
<br/>
The comparison we&#39;re making here of 4% Bard to 7% PVP is flawed.  <br/>
What we should be comparing is the ratio of one choice to another 4% <br/>
Bard, 10% Druid, 8% Wizard, etc. to the ratio of one server choice to <br/>
another 7% PVP, 93% PVP.<br/>
<br/>
Bard:Wizard 1:2<br/>
PVP:PVE 1:13<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not likely.  The reason more people don&#39;t play them is because the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>return on the work invested is not proportionate.  Unless you truly <br/>
enjoy the actual work involved, there is no reason to play a bard.  <br/>
Some people do enjoy the constant challenge despite the fact it is <br/>
not rewarded equivalently to the lesser challenges of other classes.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bards are not some Nietzschian ideal class that only those who are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>willing to sacrifice can play and for which they are rewarded with <br/>
awesome powers.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is inherently arrogant to assume that bards are actually really <br/>
 </span></blockquote>powerful but are not played by more people solely because of <br/>
ignorance, laziness, or incapacity.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s back up a bit on this one.  Do you agree or not agree that <br/>
Bards are tougher to play to their fullest potential than a Druid or <br/>
a Warrior?<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t some self-serving, stroke my own ego question.  Plain and <br/>
simple, &quot;Are Bards harder to play well?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say: Yes.<br/>
I think you say: Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, we can move on to power, once we assume well played.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a well played Bard is more powerful than a well played <br/>
other class?<br/>
<br/>
I say: Yes.<br/>
I assume you disagree: No.<br/>
<br/>
The only answer I have for why more people don&#39;t play Bards is cause <br/>
they&#39;re the hardest class to play well.  I&#39;ve seen, first hand, how <br/>
powerful we can be in comparison to other group members.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
seen, in perfectly balanced groups, how worthless what I have <br/>
contributes.  The only thing I don&#39;t see, first hand, is how the <br/>
group operates substituting me for a different class.  Maybe the <br/>
level of difficulty to play is not worth the extra power.  I suppose <br/>
you could argue that it&#39;s not, based soley on how few people play <br/>
Bards.  Or maybe people don&#39;t understand how powerful a well played <br/>
Bard can be.<br/>
