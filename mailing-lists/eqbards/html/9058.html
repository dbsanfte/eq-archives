 </span></blockquote>Yes.. this is precisely what is causing it.   The reason bards seem to be in<br/>
a lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>
everyone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>
songs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>
coming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>
just saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>
shields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at the<br/>
druid)<br/>
