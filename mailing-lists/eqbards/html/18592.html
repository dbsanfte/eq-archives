<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244571921">Well as hoped I reached my 26th song last Thursday evening and quickly<br/>
scribed it.  I was in a group at the time so didn&#39;t get to try out the<br/>
Fear/Chains tricks that evening.  However we got hit by a huge train by an<br/>
ogre running out of the goblin mines and everyone was sure we were going to<br/>
die.  The Zone call was made, so I strummed up Screech and crossed my<br/>
fingers.  Every single goblin fled.  The party seeing this decided to try<br/>
and pick them off as they came back.  With our druid and ranger snaring them<br/>
and me playing Denon&#39;s, Hymn, and Screech, we were able to kill off a 14<br/>
goblin train 2 at a time.  It was glorious!<br/>
<br/>
On Friday nite I got a chance to try it out soloing while I waited for other<br/>
guild members to show up.  All the tricks I was given worked excellently!<br/>
Kudos to all those who gave pointers.  Using Chains and Screech was<br/>
ridiculously effective.  If I accidentally got extra mobs it never mattered,<br/>
they just ran away every time I feared and along the same path as the mob I<br/>
was Chaining, so it was like keeping a steady stream of victims &#39;on the<br/>
leash&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I was emboldened by my success and decided to try a different theme on the<br/>
whole Screech tactic.  An all instrument Screech version.  Try this if you<br/>
dare!  I ran into the middle of the haunted tower in the Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>
you know the one with the Icebone, Charbone, and Warbone skeletons.  I then<br/>
fired up Denon&#39;s with my horn nailing all five skeletons (All blue to me).<br/>
I then twisted in Fear and Hymn switching to Mandolin for Hymn.  From the<br/>
comments of the 5 or 6 passerby it must have been quite hilarious.  The<br/>
Screech would send the skeletons (mostly DoT&#39;d) running from the tower.  I<br/>
would heal with Hymn.  They would run back in, get a dose of Denon&#39;s, a<br/>
quick Screech, and then run back out.  After several minutes of this they<br/>
all lay dead around me and I never lost more than a bubble of health to<br/>
resisters or when pulsing Denon&#39;s.  I still can&#39;t believe I was able to solo<br/>
5 blues that in melee would each do 3-4 bubs to me.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say the tactics were a huge success, thanks all again!  I&#39;m very<br/>
glad I was in an optimistic mood on Friday and downloaded the Solon&#39;s tricks<br/>
from Rokenn&#39;s Song Analysis site.  I made 27th on Saturday nite and by<br/>
Sunday evening I had practiced on newbie mobs and was happily soloing duos<br/>
and trios of white/blues using Sirens.  I can&#39;t wait to get back to it.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a couple of important things about Siren&#39;s in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
Do not try to charm the renegade Iksar.  I could not even charm Iksar<br/>
bandits (probably about 15 levels below me).  I got 10 resists in a row on<br/>
an Iksar bandit and gave up.  I had previously tried an Iksar brigand and<br/>
gotten 10 resists in a row on that mob as well.  Sabertooths seem quite<br/>
susceptible to charm.  A sabertooth grimalkin is quite capable of killing 3<br/>
blues before you need a new pet and seldom resisted my Sirens attempts even<br/>
with battle gear on (93 cha).  Warbones skels, although easier to melee solo<br/>
than Iksar Exiles, can strangely beat those same Exiles when used as a pet.<br/>
My blue Sabertooth Grimalkin pet was even able to beat a white/black Iksar<br/>
Exile and only lost about half its health.  Those Grimalkins hit hard!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions!<br/>
