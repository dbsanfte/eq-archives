<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248697483">Um. I would not call this &quot;going to any length&quot; That warp has been there a<br/>
LONG time. I am glad to see it finally fixed.<br/>
Also, they probably have differentprogrammers working on different things.<br/>

&gt;ZONE WARPS FIXED<br/>
&gt;Welhunlo reports that the zone warp which allowed you to hop across West<br/>
&gt;Karana by swimming under the water has now been fixed. It now<br/>
&gt;bumps you back<br/>
&gt;onto the shore.<br/>
&gt;The warp in Commonlands has also been fixed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was posted on Caster&#39;s Realm and from what I heard being shouted last<br/>
&gt;night it is apparently true.  Why is that Verant will go to any lengths<br/>
&gt;seemingly to fix any bug which might cause an unintentional beneficial<br/>
&gt;effect, yet totally ignore bugs which produce unintentional negative<br/>
&gt;effects?  There are several zones where mobs warp all the time,<br/>
&gt;most notably<br/>
&gt;in my mind the semi newbie zone of Qeynos Hills.  Attacking things<br/>
&gt;that flee<br/>
&gt;in that zone is mind-numbingly difficult without Root as they will nearly<br/>
&gt;always run a short distance then warp to the road near the zone line.  When<br/>
&gt;Holly gets trained to that spot the entire zone becomes her<br/>
&gt;personal hunting<br/>
&gt;ground as every person who attacks a wolf that flees gets added to her hate<br/>
&gt;list while she is near that point.  Has Verant addressed this bug in any<br/>
&gt;way?  No.  They sure will fix a warp that might do nothing more beneficial<br/>
&gt;than save someone some time.  Not that I really approve of using such a<br/>
&gt;warp, I don&#39;t.  I certainly don&#39;t approve of Verant&#39;s devil-may-care<br/>
&gt;attitude towards warps that are not beneficial either.  They are equally<br/>
&gt;ridiculous, more disruptive of game atmosphere, and bigger causes of player<br/>
&gt;(hence customer, least important person in Verant client-provider<br/>
&gt;relationship) discomfort.  Just ask anyone who&#39;s ever been to Mistmoore how<br/>
&gt;they feel about warping.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t work at Verant that is.<br/>
