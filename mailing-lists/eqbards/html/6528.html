<div id="ygrps-yiv-238423136">First off it ywould be pointless to make a quest item NO TRADE since you<br/>
could then drop it on the ground for someone else to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
	Second, my guess is that allowing us to place NO DROP items just in the<br/>
bank may be more difficult than it seems. Coding wise they probably just<br/>
have a check to see that where you place a NO DROP item or container with a<br/>
NO DROP item is somewhere other than on your personal inventory. There may<br/>
not be an easy way at that point to discern between the bank and some other<br/>
location. Then again they simply may not want to make the effort...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I think the best way Verant could handle this is to make<br/>
8)quest components NO<br/>
8)TRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>
8)components in the bank until you got them all and eliminates<br/>
8)using mule<br/>
8)characters to collect the items.  This would also allow<br/>
8)Verant to start<br/>
8)giving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>
8)completes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.<br/>
