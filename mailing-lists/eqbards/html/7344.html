<b>Subject:</b> Letter to GZ - Draft 3 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-203942675">Okay, I haven&#39;t been at the office for a few days (which is where I do all<br/>
of my emailing), but I&#39;m back now and have a revised version of the letter<br/>
than I&#39;ll be sending to GZ.  The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>
been removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>
I almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>
people felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>
that this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>
point regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>
song in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>
I&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>
comments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that I<br/>
send in.<br/>

<br/>
1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>
they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>
at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>
get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>
questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>
effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>
does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>
it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>
this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
<br/>
3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
4) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>
implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>
<br/>
5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>
spell uses, along with its casting time.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book<br/>
show what instrument skill is required when you right click on a song?<br/>
<br/>
6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>
aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>
were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>
1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
