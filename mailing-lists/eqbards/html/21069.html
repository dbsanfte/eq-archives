<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057843894">Pardon a paranoid rant here - but I&#39;ve worked as a programmer since 1984.<br/>
Several times in my career - I inherited some code (I&#39;m proud to say - I<br/>
never originated any) - that was so complex and poorly written that everyone<br/>
was really afraid to go in and mess around with it much.  The code was<br/>
usually too big and important to get management approval to spend a<br/>
significant amount of time just rewrite the sucker.<br/>
<br/>
	You&#39;d try to make changes around it as much as possible to get anything<br/>
done - but from time to time - you just had no choice to open up the hood<br/>
and muck around there.  After you did - often you&#39;d find you created a few<br/>
new problems despite your best efforts.<br/>
<br/>
	Sometimes we&#39;d be able to convince the users to live with the new quirks<br/>
because the end result was still much better than what we started out with -<br/>
and they had other stuff they wanted us to work on.  You&#39;d always hope for<br/>
that big project that would have the budget to sneak in the time to re-write<br/>
it even if wasn&#39;t necessary to get that project done.<br/>
<br/>
	Now we&#39;ve seen tons of cool new stuff come in with the client.  New colors<br/>
for example.  Shoot, the turnaround from when someone suggested the LFG flag<br/>
to implementation seemed like two weeks.  I&#39;m guessing the &quot;chat shell&quot;,<br/>
&quot;who&#39;s online&quot; etc is simple and nicely written.<br/>
<br/>
	Sure seems to be lots of signs that the Spell System is one nasty goop of<br/>
poorly written, implemented, and tested bit of nastiness...<br/>

Just another example of Verant&#39;s attitude towards it&#39;s players.  They screw<br/>
up a change, then decide since it isn&#39;t (in their opinion) too bad a<br/>
screw-up, they say it&#39;s now &quot;as intended&quot;.  At this point the only thing<br/>
keeping me playing is I have already paid for two more months yet, and the<br/>
other games I am interested in are not out yet.  If either of those things<br/>
were not true I would already be gone, solely due to Verant&#39;s attitude.<br/>

See the thread I posted on the Gameplay forum.  Read my post, and<br/>
Abashi&#39;s response.  Chains is NOT going to be fixed.  Well, maybe in two<br/>
years, after one of these &quot;we post for four months in order to get a<br/>
confused one sentence reply&quot; deals.<br/>

&gt; &gt; here&#39;s a quote from Gordon:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23<br/>
&gt; non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other<br/>
&gt; things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding<br/>
&gt; chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is<br/>
&gt; that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>
