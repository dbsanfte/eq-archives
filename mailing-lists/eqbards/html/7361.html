Dancing Nerfed<br/>

It has come to our attention here at Verant that certain bards have been <br/>
using their dance animation to entertain other players. This is clearly <br/>
unbalancing, as other classes lack similar animations. We plan to implement <br/>
a new command called /dance to balance out this obvious inequality, but <br/>
found that on the test server this caused ogres and trolls to explode, and <br/>
caused dark elves to fly into a frenzy and attack everything in range, even <br/>
somehow to the point of ignoring -PvP flags. Curiously, halflings could not <br/>
be made to stop dancing once the command has been used.<br/>
<br/>
Until this can be remedied, the following changes will be in effect:<br/>
<br/>
Male bards will still be able to dance when playing songs on some wind or <br/>
brass instruments. However, the animation has been changed to match the new <br/>
music for this animation, Pop Goes the Weasel. Note that, once begun, this <br/>
dance will not end until the song has stopped, which will take approximately <br/>
8 minutes. In order to reduce abuse, this animation will preclude the use of <br/>
any song or spell effects except those causing harm to the bard. When the <br/>
song has been completed the animation will end, and the bard will take 500hp <br/>
of damage and lose all fatigue, to reflect the enormous physical drain of <br/>
dancing.<br/>

This topic isnt funny at all!<br/>

Dear gamers,<br/>
<br/>
Such mocking of our patching system is not funny. We work really hard to <br/>
provide a fun and ballanced game. When we do present a patch its to make the <br/>
game better. I&#39;m sure you all agree a dynamic game is more fun than having a <br/>
stagnent gaming world.<br/>
<br/>
Now lets face it, the bard class was an accident. It was never intended as a <br/>
viable player class, it was only included cause in the early stages of <br/>
development we copied everything out of Gary Gygax&#39;s books. You will note <br/>
that none of the developement team nor any of the GM&#39;s play bards as that <br/>
would hose their character too much (You dont want a GM who has to twist for <br/>
effects, they&#39;d never be able to type to you and tell you why your banned.) <br/>
We also do no testing on bards when contemplating new changes cause if it <br/>
hurts you , well its because your a jack of all trades meaning you get all <br/>
the disadvantages and none of the benifits of other classes.<br/>
<br/>
We have already removed female dancing cause it gave females an unfair <br/>
advantage over their male counterparts. (You expect to look cute AND dance? <br/>
That is way too unbalancing.) Of course the idea of damage/fatigue from <br/>
dancing sounds nice, I&#39;ll see about implementing that soon, so maybe I&#39;ll <br/>
include female dancing again.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are interested here is the way a patch is made.<br/>
<br/>
1. A problem is spotted. While there are many difficult problems in the <br/>
game, our priority are the ones that players have some control over. That <br/>
way the patch is seen as a punishnment for something you did wrong, not us.<br/>
<br/>
2. GM&#39;s are sent out to spy on players. Each GM is to report how rampant <br/>
such abuse by players is. Since the GM only watch players who are commiting <br/>
such abuse, we manage to get a 100% abuse rate, which justifies an immediate <br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
3. Our think tank squad spends 30 min comming up with an equitable, in game <br/>
soulution that makes sense and will work . For example in the kiting patch, <br/>
they suggested Dots have reduced effect when the CASTER moves showing that <br/>
spells with an over time component require some degree of concentration in <br/>
order to have its full effect.<br/>
<br/>
4. The programmers are then given the problem and disreguard any equitable, <br/>
in game soulution as too dificult to program and instead cut and paste old <br/>
code from existing parts of the program to make create a patch. In the <br/>
kiting patch it was decided to change the rules of physics for players <br/>
dots...mob dots were left as is.<br/>
<br/>
5. The patch is then placed on the test server. This is a crucial part of <br/>
the procedure since the test server is composed of players who are less <br/>
abusive to the system (i.e no power levelers there) and have all applied to <br/>
Verant for a position there. This insures a minimal of complaining and <br/>
exagerates the effectiveness of the patch which makes the programmers look <br/>
good to their boss. Since there is a smaller population on the test server <br/>
the chances that any one patch will have a noticable effect on a given <br/>
class/race/level combination is minimal making it crucial for us to beliive <br/>
we have everything under control.<br/>
<br/>
6. The patch is placed online and we shut everything down for a couple of <br/>
hours so we can go out and have a few drinks.<br/>
<br/>
7. We observe the results of the patch. Hopefully it greates a few <br/>
unintended bugs thus ensuring us perpetual job security and that we dont <br/>
have to address the real tough concearns that may lose us consumers such as <br/>
ebay buying and twinking.<br/>
<br/>
8. We shut down all the servers for hours at a time for much needed naps <br/>
since we have to work around the clock instead of hiring a large enough <br/>
staff to handle all the problems that arise. We call thaese naps our <br/>
emergancy patch downtime.<br/>
<br/>
9. We then ask a survey with choices specifiaclly designed to lead people to <br/>
answer the way we want. Only questions that are self serving are asked so we <br/>
know which group of players are affected by the choice. Such questions like <br/>
do you think you should do more damage while in melee give us the ammo we <br/>
need to justify hoseing non-tanks. We do not ask questions that would give <br/>
us any ideas as to actual game improvement, such as should we have more <br/>
trade skills, or would you rather see us address class balancing or camping <br/>
reduction as our first priority.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will all see the wisdom of our procedure and will stop mocking <br/>
us. If you don&#39;t I&#39;ll be forced to to make the bard class KOS to all town <br/>
residents.<br/>

Mocking Verant<br/>
by Smed  posted 9/20/99 11:32:40 PM<br/>

I am sincerely disappointed in the lack of maturity and respect shown by <br/>
posters on this board. We here at Verant work long and hard to provide you <br/>
with entertainment which will keep you in a dazed and drug-like stupor for <br/>
months on end. You must admit that playing EverQuest is less expensive and <br/>
less prone to legal repercussions than just buying a kilo of coke per month, <br/>
a comparable addiction.<br/>
<br/>
Because bards are a small subsection of our player base, you must realize <br/>
that fixing the &quot;holes&quot; in your class is not a priority for our overworked <br/>
programmers. Instead of implementing your missing songs, or fixing the few <br/>
that are not yet fully functional, we find it far more cost-effective to <br/>
create new equipment and quests for warriors and rangers. After all, let&#39;s <br/>
face it, tanks are necessary parts of any good party, while bards are just <br/>
whiny pansies with flutes.<br/>
<br/>
However, because we don&#39;t want you to feel we are ignoring you completely, <br/>
we have taken steps to assure that the denizens of Norrath have a special <br/>
appreciation for bards. To this end, we have increased bard&#39;s ability to <br/>
taunt monsters by approximately 4172% in the latest patch. Now bards will <br/>
have no difficulty in finding game to hunt, as monsters from across the zone <br/>
will home in on that annoying music. In fact, we are currently testing new <br/>
code which will allow monsters in nearby zones to be aware of bards and come <br/>
to meet them at the zone entries.<br/>
<br/>
There, happy?<br/>

p.s. I really *do* love the game, but I feel it incumbent on me as a bard to <br/>
use one of our most potent weapons - satire - to expose any and all <br/>
foolishness on the part of the high and mighty, as long as it seems like <br/>
fun.<br/>
