<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070538627">Boy that screenshot brings up old memories.  I have been a member of this<br/>
list since about a month after EQ went retail.<br/>
<br/>
Those were the days when a lvl 17-20 group with a bard and a cleric could<br/>
OWN Highpass Hold, and get uber loot like Cracked Darkwood Shields, PGT&#39;s,<br/>
shiny halberds and shralok packs! I have fond memories of saving my party<br/>
many many many times with Lullaby and  discovering just how much damage you<br/>
could do with an instruments only three song Chords, DDD and heal combo to<br/>
all those orcs and gnolls.<br/>
<br/>
Since then it seems like we have been stealth nerfed into oblivion, although<br/>
I still have tons of fun with Lago.<br/>
<br/>
Any of you guys remember the discussions that happened about just &quot;what&quot; the<br/>
lvl 32 song was.  Nobody even knew!  <br/>
