top of the stairs to level 3, there&#39;s a rock.  If you stand on<br/>
the rock, you can get stuck there (can&#39;t jump off, can&#39;t move,<br/>
etc).  He tried ducking, jumping, turning, all sorts of<br/>
things, none of which worked.  Eventually he hit upon some<br/>
combination of movements which popped him through the roof<br/>
(this happens with the Kelethin lifts too), and he found<br/>
himself in the cat room.  We were all around level 13 at the<br/>
time and there were several player corpses in there, so he was<br/>
too scared to move.  Turns out Verant added a zone to West<br/>
Commonlands just down the hall from the cat room, so he wasted<br/>
two nights of play waiting for a GM when all he had to do was<br/>
move a few paces away.<br/>
