&gt; My problem with this explanation is that most other changes like this to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My guess is since casters can be bound anywhere, they&#39;d bind<br/>
themselves nearby (in a safe spot), group would fight mob,<br/>
caster would unload mana, pre-arranged duel friend would kill<br/>
caster, caster would respawn with full mana and join the fight<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose a more creative solution would&#39;ve been to record the<br/>
caster&#39;s mana at the time when the duel was going on (assuming<br/>
no mob hit him/hits no mobs), then return him to that mana<br/>
state when he respawns.<br/>
