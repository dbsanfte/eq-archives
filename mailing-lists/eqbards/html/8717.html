<b>Subject:</b> LORE item looting change? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909782697">On the subject of Lambent quest components, I noticed that the LORE items<br/>
that I found last night in Cazic off of Alligators were not able to be<br/>
looted PERIOD if you already had such an item in your inventory.  In<br/>
particular the Alligators were dropping a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot;, both were<br/>
ALL/ALL and had NO stat bonuses.  Obviously quest items.  They were frequent<br/>
drops too.  After everyone in our group had a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot; we<br/>
simply couldn&#39;t loot the alligators anymore and instead received messages<br/>
saying something along the lines of &#39;You already have one such item in your<br/>
inventory!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
SO - If it is the case across the board that LORE items, once looted by an<br/>
individual, cannot be looted (or even destroyed!) off of a mob by that same<br/>
individual, you are going to see a LOT of free lore item calls from groups<br/>
camping things like the Lizzy Fanatics in Cazic (mudwater runes).<br/>
<br/>
Again, my group left a trail of Alligators with Steins and Shovels on them<br/>
because we COULDN&#39;T loot or destroy these items.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else encountered this LORE item behavior?<br/>
