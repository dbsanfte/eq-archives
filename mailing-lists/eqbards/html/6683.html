possible that you were just lagged out.  I have noticed it myself where I<br/>
will be fine and suddnely will not receive packets for a few moments...<br/>
then I get a large burst of packets to update me.  So far it has never<br/>
happened when I was invisible.  So hopefully that is the cause of you<br/>
becoming visible.<br/>
