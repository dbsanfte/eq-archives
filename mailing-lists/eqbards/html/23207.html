<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023183808">I&#39;ve heard that fear kiting in those &quot;T&quot; spots can also be considered an exploit.  Yes, fear can break and you still have risk, but one of the usual risks of fear kiting is running into another mob.  Using these &quot;T&quot;&#39;s effectively cancels out this risk.<br/>
<br/>
I think it comes down to the interpretation of the GM witnessing the event, unfortunately.  VI doesn&#39;t seem to have published any guidelines to go by.<br/>
