&gt;&gt; about.  At later levels having grown up in Sol B and Lower Guk from 35-45<br/>
&gt;&gt; you get into sort of a mindset of pull-kill, pull-kill,<br/>
&gt;pull-kill.  Higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; level players sometimes don&#39;t use their imaginations about things to do!<br/>
&gt;&gt; Here are some suggestions of interesting things for high levels to do for<br/>
&gt;&gt; experience:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  There are plenty of named NPCs to drop as well, like the Priests of<br/>
&gt;  Discord, the leader of the Greenbloods(?) in Oggok whose name evades<br/>
&gt;  me... something like Sonooog.  Hell I love Oggok, I&#39;ve cleared most<br/>
&gt;  of the bouncers that people have never even heard of before.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;  gone all the way to the bank to pull ogres heheehe. (most are green<br/>
&gt;  but the loot is good for buying soulstones ;) </span></blockquote></div>
