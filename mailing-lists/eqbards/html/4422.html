<div id="ygrps-yiv-66929260">This is for the gentleman who asked that I explain what I meant by the<br/>
&quot;linkdead flag&quot; that is set on your character upon becoming charmed or<br/>
feared.<br/>
<br/>
As someone pointed out, when your character is charmed or feared in a PvP<br/>
environment, the level limit for pvp disappears, and if you do a /who you<br/>
will see that the person has &lt;LINKDEAD&gt; next to their name.  This tactic is<br/>
often used in Rallos Zek by unsavory types to kill PC they might not<br/>
normally be able to kill(the same types of people as our good friend<br/>
Silverios who, upon getting the disarm skill, proceeded to walk around in<br/>
every dungeon disarming everone she saw).<br/>
<br/>
In Tallon Zek, the race war server, bards and enchanters will own when all<br/>
is said and done at lv 50, least until christmas&#39; expansion.  There are two<br/>
primary tactics that will prove deadly in pvp.  First, you can charm/make<br/>
them attack a high level mob, and then zone.  When you&#39;re wiped off of the<br/>
hatelist all that is left is your pet and the mob, and the mob will not stop<br/>
attacking the PC.  Second, there&#39;s the fear, chains combo, in which the PC<br/>
is entirely helpless as they walk slowly around the zone while you whack<br/>
them from behind.  I was talking to a friend the other day that said the<br/>
anti magical aura song (lv 40+ i think) does some AMAZING things to PC spell<br/>
casters.  I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>
that will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>
tactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>
someone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).</div>
