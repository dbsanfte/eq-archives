<div id="ygrps-yiv-52450175">Pixie strike is a great song.  I almost never used it when I first got it,<br/>
but I&#39;m really enjoying it now.<br/>
My question is this, how on earth can you effectively use it on two mobs in<br/>
the confusion of melee?  I have enough trouble clicking on the one creature<br/>
that my party isn&#39;t fighting, let alone trying to select back and forth<br/>
between two.  It would be really nice if we could dynamically assign hot<br/>
keys to monsters, then just quickly hit the keys to toggle back and forth.<br/>
Ah well, wishful thinking.<br/>

When you get Pixie Strike at L28, you&#39;ll find Strike is more<br/>
relabile at holding 1-2 mobs.  The enchanter&#39;s mesmerize is<br/>
also preferable for this reason.  But if you ever get into a<br/>
situation with 4+ mobs and the enchanter can&#39;t/is afraid to<br/>
area effect mesmerize, this song will save your butts.  The<br/>
main problem seems to be if you group regularly with the same<br/>
people, they get used to this song letting them tackle trains,<br/>
and when you&#39;re not with them they may try to do the same<br/>
thing and die quickly.  :-)<br/>
