<div id="ygrps-yiv-746673041">The thing is the though the high levels need a good fun area to hunt that<br/>
isn&#39;t way overcrowded. I was on my necro the other day doing a quest and in<br/>
Unrest the zone had only 19 people in it during prime time. Then CT is just<br/>
as empty to. Then you go and look at Lower Guk and Sol B and see it pakced<br/>
with 50+ people in it. Thanks to the new kith zone and PoH the high levels<br/>
are finnally starting to spreadout. It&#39;s a lot better that it&#39;s a high level<br/>
zone then a low level zone.<br/>

&gt;I had heard a few complaints from newbies that they were now cut off from<br/>
&gt;travelling to their guild in Qeynos, but since Kithicor was as safe as ever<br/>
&gt;during the day hours I find this unjustified.  It was good to see Verant<br/>
&gt;making some real storyline related changes to a zone.  I just wish they<br/>
&gt;could effectively do those sort of things at a lower level, say in the 25<br/>
&gt;range instead of 40.  Problem is, all those 40+ level characters would<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ll be really surprised if Asheron&#39;s Call is much of a threat to EQ.  From<br/>
&gt;what I saw in Beta it was no match for EQ despite the problems in EQ.<br/>
&gt;There were some really sweet weapons a bard could use on some of those<br/>
&gt;undead apparently.  sadly I was unable to get any even though most of the<br/>
&gt;people I saw fighting them would have zero use for them.  Its a bit<br/>
&gt;irritating to watch a 50th level paladin scooping up no drop piercing<br/>
&gt;weapons.<br/>

&gt;Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>
&gt;events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>
&gt;Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>
&gt;live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has 1.5<br/>
&gt;million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the retail release<br/>
&gt;of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be very aggressive<br/>

&gt;&gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
&gt;&gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt;&gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>
