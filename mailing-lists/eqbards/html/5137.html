<br/>
I think everyone gets bored with the mindless combat.  I feel forced to do<br/>
it for xp.  I need the xp to level up so I can stay close enough to my<br/>
fiends to adventure with them.  Three weeks ago - I was doing 1 level every<br/>
couple days.  For past 2 weeks - I have barely made 3 bubs.  For one week<br/>
not even a bub.  <br/>
<br/>
But the big reason to level up is to go to new places.  You need to go to<br/>
new places to be afraid and see the new monsters.  Even so, I wonder what<br/>
happens when you have seen everything?<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I think the big fun in the game is the other people.  Yes,<br/>
there are lots of dweebs.  But I talk to everyone and try to do things to<br/>
make it fun.  If you want more role playing - you have to play the role.  I<br/>
meet a lot of players and I axe them if they rp and many will say they want<br/>
to but don&#39;t know how.  I must admit - I don&#39;t really know how - this is my<br/>
first game like this.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a char.  I run around and adventure.  I try to help new ppl.  I die<br/>
in bad places and have to find someone to rescue me. (Big Thanks to Kalvidar<br/>
and Plorare - both played key roles in helping get my bod out of somewhere<br/>
in Runnyeye it had no place being :-)  For me, it&#39;s the interaction with<br/>
people not the AI that make this game fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, there are problems.  Let&#39;s wave the magic wand and &quot;fix&quot; all of the<br/>
problems.  Even so --  you have to have other people to make it fun.  It<br/>
used to be hard to get 6 friends to come over and sit around the table for a<br/>
night of gaming (or so I am told since I don&#39;t have that experience.)  The<br/>
technology makes it easier to &quot;get everyone together&quot; but you still have to<br/>
find some fiends who wanna do the same stuff you do - then you go do it.<br/>
Whether it&#39;s camping, questing, powergamer xp, exploring, or whatever.  But<br/>
one has to make the effort to make what&#39;s fun happen.  <br/>

		I know this is a long post, my friends, but it&#39;s probably my<br/>
very last post to this group, so I appologize.  I apologize in advance for<br/>
the language, if you are sensitive, stop now.<br/>
		There is no death in EverQuest, except psychologically.  And<br/>
I&#39;m dying, I think.<br/>
		I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known in some<br/>
years.   It is highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy<br/>
luggage.<br/>
		Bored.  I&#39;m bored.  Thinking of quiting because of it.</div>
