<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017348706">Talking about Dragoon Dirks, I did an /auction last night to see if anyone<br/>
had one.<br/>
Some generous guy asked me how much money I had, and all my net worth <br/>
was 15pp and a minotaur axe.  He sold me the dirk for 15pp.  Praise<br/>

Unfortunately, I do not remember this guys name to give him credit, but it<br/>
was <br/>
something like Nuntien or something...<br/>
