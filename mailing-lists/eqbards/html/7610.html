Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping is the final draft.  Unless there are any major<br/>
complaints, I&#39;ll fire this off to GZ before I leave work today.<br/>
<br/>

Elwyn Heartstring<br/>
Level 44 Bard<br/>
Erollisi Marr<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>
they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>
at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>
get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>
questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>
effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>
does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>
it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>
this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
<br/>
3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
4) There seems to be an absense of any mid to high level bard quests.  Is<br/>
there any implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>
<br/>
5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>
spell uses.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book show what instrument skill is<br/>
required when you right click on a song?<br/>
<br/>
6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>
aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>
were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>
1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
7) It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo&#39;s when in an<br/>
outdoor zone, would &#39;break&#39; the effects of the root spell.  With a recent<br/>
patch, this is no longer the case.  Was it a bug that it broke root<br/>
originally, or is it a bug that now it doesn&#39;t?  When could we expect a fix<br/>
for this if it is a bug?<br/>
<br/>
8) Our instument skills cap at 200.  After level 40, our songs get more<br/>
difficult to play, but our skills do not increase to match.  This can result<br/>
in 15-20 missed notes from high level songs in one battle.  Why do our<br/>
skills cap at such a level that our high level songs become difficult to<br/>
play, let alone stack?  This doesn&#39;t seem to make sense, as casters magic<br/>
skills (evokation, conjuration, etc.) cap at 250 or so.<br/>
