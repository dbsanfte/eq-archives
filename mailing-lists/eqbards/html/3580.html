mobs that give special items in GuK are high teens to mid 20s,<br/>
with a few up into the 30s.  My friends and I got decimated in<br/>
there when we first tried it at L17-19.  A couple nights ago,<br/>
my L21-26 group of six had a moderately easy time getting to<br/>
the froglok lord room, but had to turn around there because of<br/>
the multiple yellow/red frogs (to me at 26) that were inside.  <br/>
The frogloks at the entrance have mostly trash loot (though I<br/>
suppose woven armor might not be considered trash).<br/>
<br/>
In Paw, the special items come from low to mid teen mobs, and<br/>
the dungeon is not very close to any of the newbie city zones.<br/>
