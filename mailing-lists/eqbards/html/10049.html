<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581705436">ok, I&#39;m a wood elf, so I started with 50 in forage (or so I hear). I<br/>
have NEVER bought food for myself. I occasionally have to buy milk,<br/>
(although not for the past 10 levels). <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;grapes&quot; you forage that do not stack are actually 2 different<br/>
items, Berries, and Fruit.<br/>
<br/>
When foraging i usually arrage my food items so that whatever i have the<br/>
most of gets eaten last. This is useful for saving on weight, i carry 20<br/>
of one item, less weight than carrying 5 of 4 items. Also is good when i<br/>
actually find someone who needs food (just foraging I usually have 60<br/>
food or more at all times) i can give it to them.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, you know that message &quot;you cannot try to forage while attacking&quot;?<br/>
well, you CAN try, you just can&#39;t succeed. I have forage hotkeyed on my<br/>
main combat hotkeys. Occasionally i have hit it during combat<br/>
accidently. One time when i did this i got the above message and then i<br/>
got &quot;you have increased your skill in Forage (43)&quot;. This was with my<br/>
druid, since my bard has been maxed in forage since he got it.<br/>

&gt; I have forage maxed, and hardly ever succesfully forage.  It leveled so <br/>
&gt; slowly that i put about 20 practice points into it (I still have about 30 <br/>
&gt; points).  I get water so seldom that i always buy milk.  I usually get <br/>
&gt; grapes, and they don&#39;t always stack together.  Forage is a letdown for me.<br/>
