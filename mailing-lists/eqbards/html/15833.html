&gt; Chords of Cessation with a lute does more damage than I do<br/>
&gt; with my weapons.  I tested it against some L8 mobs, took them<br/>
&gt; to half, then fought with weapons and added up the damage.<br/>

last night.  Our ench&#39;s and sha&#39;s had camped so the task of slowing the mob<br/>
fell to the bard (me).  I tried Chains 10 to 15 times and got 100% resists.<br/>
Not worth punching the key at that point.<br/>
<br/>
And when you can use AE songs. Largo&#39;s was not an option.  Nor any AE song<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Chasing the odd Dog around an over camped Sol-B is one thing but blaring AE<br/>
and breaking mezzed mobs in a multi-mob planar fights is another.  It looks<br/>
like level 47 & 48 the bard fights either blue & green mobs in the various<br/>
dungeons or they fight yellow and red mobs on the alter-planes with the odd<br/>
dragon and fire/ice giant guards tossed in for variety.  There is a big<br/>
difference in performance between these 2 situations (green/blues vs<br/>
yellow/reds).  And some of the yellow/reds in the planes are effectively<br/>
100% resistent to magic.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The 122 dam/target/round Rokenn lists above works out to 1220<br/>
&gt; damage/minute.  This is *on par* with two of the top necro<br/>
&gt; DoTs stacked.  You can do a helluva lot of damage with these<br/>
&gt; songs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Given the right situations.  They probably thought they were doing us a<br/>
*favor* making them AE (hey, they can fight all the (red) mobs at the same<br/>
time &lt;heh&gt;) rather than target and affecting only one mob at a time.  But<br/>
again target or AE - level difference matter first and foremost on how well<br/>
they do.  Funny thing, CoD vs a red mob makes it just as mad when it doesn&#39;t<br/>
stick as when it does.  Taunt without damage - heh.<br/>
