&gt; I fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class is that as you<br/>
&gt; mature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over time, start to do more<br/>
&gt; damage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.  So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>
&gt; bard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as much<br/>
&gt; research into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game as a<br/>
&gt; &quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce your<br/>
&gt; wife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you develop<br/>
&gt; your skills more fully.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>
&gt; level 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My guess<br/>
&gt; is that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>
&gt; level 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs and<br/>
&gt; instruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>
&gt; crossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>
will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>
upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>
L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>
beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>
come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>
see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>
party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>
which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>
damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I&#39;m in a bad mood I think that if it wasn&#39;t for the mana<br/>
song, Bards would be lower on the list for getting in a group than a<br/>
rogue in most people&#39;s eyes. (assuming both characters are played well<br/>
by people who are fun to have in your group)<br/>
