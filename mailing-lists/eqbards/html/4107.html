&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, been /auctioning my little Bardic lungs out in every zone from<br/>
&gt;E Karana to Freeport (my current mail runs).  Nobody seems to have any<br/>
&gt;Golden Amber Earrings to sell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being a wimpy Wood Elf trying to wear heavy Bronze, I&#39;m on a quest for<br/>
&gt;items to increase my STR.  I&#39;ve got a purity belt and a spiked collar.<br/>
&gt;I thought the Golden Amber Earrings would be easy enough to find, but<br/>
&gt;not so far...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One problem is I don&#39;t know where these come from.  Are they loot?  Are<br/>
&gt;they jewelcraft?  My normal modus operandi is to wander over to wherever<br/>
&gt;the loot comes from and /auction there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any better suggestions for +str items?  And if so, where<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is for my server, Bertox. Your mileage may vary:<br/>
<br/>
Trollhide Belt (+5 STR, +5 STA, Rogue/Bard only!) - 100pp - Found in Upper<br/>
Gukk<br/>
Blackened Iron Crown (+5 STR, and too many other bonuses to list) - 200pp -<br/>
Runnyeye<br/>
Bloodstained Mantle (I think it&#39;s +3 STR and +10 Magic Resist) - 75pp -<br/>
Unrest<br/>
Jagged Band (+5 AC, +3 STR, or maybe the other way around) - ??? - Unrest<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few to give you an idea....<br/>
