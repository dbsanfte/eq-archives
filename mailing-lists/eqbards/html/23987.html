You already said exactly that, &quot;Anybody can hit autoattack and the <br/>
occasional taunt, bash, or kick hotkey.&quot;  I&#39;d suggest that is a more <br/>
elitist comment than anything I said.<br/>
<br/>
My view of &quot;Class Power&quot; ignores difficulty of playing altogether.  <br/>
You can reasonably make either argument (including or ignoring Class <br/>
Power), but just make sure you&#39;re discussing the same ground rules <br/>
when you do.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By your definition a gun isn&#39;t more powerful than a sword, because <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a sword is harder to use effectively.  If it is easier to accomplish <br/>
the same thing with two different tools, but is easier with tool A <br/>
than with tool B, then tool A is by definition more powerful than <br/>
Tool B.<br/>
<br/>
By my definition, a gun is more powerful than a sword, because when <br/>
used properly (ignoring the difficulty), the gun is more powerful.  <br/>
You&#39;re saying we should incorporate &quot;level of difficulty&quot; into the <br/>
equation, not me.  Those saying &quot;Bards are overpowered&quot; are actually <br/>
saying it&#39;s not only harder with Tool A, but when used right, it&#39;s <br/>
more powerful, too.  You&#39;re saying Tool A is harder to use than Tool <br/>
B, so Tool B is more powerful.<br/>
 <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For an equal amount of effort, not skill necessarily, bards get far <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying, &quot;Played to it&#39;s fullest potential Bards can do far more <br/>
than other classes.&quot;<br/>
