<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677819536">a jerk and stupid too i guess =)  no way you&#39;d be stunning me while playing<br/>
MR songs, which i always have going before accepting the duel =)  DoTs and<br/>
DDs get through, but all or none spells, like root or stun etc, almost never<br/>
do.  50 v 50 with me having 120+ MR it&#39;s not gonna happen ;)  never tried a<br/>
necro yet, too scared.  but level 50 enchanter, cleric, shaman, druid,<br/>
wizard, magician i have all beat in duels.<br/>
