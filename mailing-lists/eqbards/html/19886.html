<br/>
There is a Bard Song Vendor in Kunark.  There aren&#39;t any trainers because we<br/>
didn&#39;t get any skills after 50 (till 53).  Those skills that were thrown in<br/>
were an after thought and the bards in the beta just went to kelethin on the<br/>
elven boat (or grabbed a gate/port) to train.<br/>
<br/>
There is a high level song vendor in Kunark so there were bards in the beta<br/>
test of Kunark.  By and large we don&#39;t have any Kunark specific issues<br/>
(except that of singing steel) and you can hardly expect 500-1000 beta<br/>
testers (I&#39;m not really sure how many of us there were) to catch the singing<br/>
steel issue in a 5 week timeframe ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Gordon has posted about this issue and his story is that the trainers<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; merchants who are there were only put there for the beta testers -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   ...ah, Clue, there are NO Bard beta testers !<br/>
