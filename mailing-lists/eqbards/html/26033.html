<div id="ygrps-yiv-402235925">Yes - for a bunch of songsters we have been silent too long   ;)<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;retired&quot; my bard at level 21 cause I wanted to concentrate on my druid. Since then I have almost quit playing, but recently have picked up again.<br/>
<br/>
If you are ever on Drinal look for a charming halfling druid named Charai or a loverly half-elf bard named Jovvi Songangel & say &quot;HEY!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Charai plays in IC or EW & Jovvi is wandering around not really working on much, but basically playing around.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
TTFN for now all <br/>
<br/>
The charmingly loverly --<br/>

Jovvi<br/>
