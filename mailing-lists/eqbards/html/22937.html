<div id="ygrps-yiv-290124128">two words &quot;tactical flexibility&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe not really.  I&#39;ve always played bards, Dragonrealms as well, AD&D,<br/>
etc.  I&#39;ve always liked bards because they are generally the &quot;Renaissance<br/>
Class&quot; they can do a little bit of everything.  I get bored doing the same<br/>
thing over and over again.  <br/>
<br/>
As the months have gone by I&#39;ve seen bards slowly get whittled down from<br/>
being a very flexible class into being a class very rigidly defined by &quot;The<br/>
Vision&quot;, not so much for balance reasons as because of some misplaced sense<br/>
of outrage that bards were not being played as they intended them to be.<br/>

&gt;So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started a Bard because I was a Bard in DragonRealms, and a Bard in <br/>
Amtgard, and a Bard in real life.  So, no reason, really ;)<br/>
