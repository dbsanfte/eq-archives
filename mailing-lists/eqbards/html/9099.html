<div id="ygrps-yiv-683415114">Ok, I tested it again with a friend last night, L39 cleric,<br/>
L40 bard.<br/>
<br/>
Normal med, 1 bubble - 100 sec<br/>
Med with Clarity left on, 1 bubble - 62 sec<br/>
Med with Clarity start/stopped each message, 1 bubble - 62 sec<br/>
Med with Clarity/Hymn, 1 bubble - 62 sec<br/>
Med with Clarity/Hymn/Accel, 1 bubble - 74 sec<br/>
<br/>
From this, I&#39;d conclude it does *not* give you mana back each<br/>
pulse.  If that were true, start/stopping Clarity with each<br/>
message, which generates a new message about every 3-4 seconds<br/>
vs. every 6 seconds, should&#39;ve dropped the meditate time to<br/>
about 40 seconds.  There is no way experimental error<br/>
(eyeballing 1 bubble, fumbling with the stopwatch, 6 second<br/>
screen updates) could account for this huge a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, we got the exact same med time playing Clarity<br/>
with one other song, but not Clarity with 2 other songs.  I<br/>
dunno if this is different from other songs, I&#39;ll have to test<br/>
it with Hymn some time - I recall getting the feeling our<br/>
songs were not lasting as long as before a couple months<br/>
ago.  But it seems the latent duration of Clarity is not quite<br/>
as long as the other songs, and you lose the effect if you<br/>
take longer than about 6 sec to refresh it.  That would mean<br/>
if you&#39;re timing meditate times playing Clarity + another<br/>
song, and you&#39;re &quot;lazy&quot; and don&#39;t immediately switch songs<br/>
when you get the message, you could be letting Clarity expire,<br/>
thus creating the illusion that Clarity is not as effective<br/>
when woven with another song.<br/>
