Well like Harmonic posted already you have the benefit of being on a<br/>
mature <br/>
servers.  At 20th level on a non-mature server I had a combine rapier<br/>
and a <br/>
combine dagger as my main weapons.  Barbed Whips were around, but were<br/>
trade <br/>
only and very rare.  FYI at 39th I just got a Runed Falchion this<br/>
weekend :)<br/>
<br/>
Again on armor at 20th I was wearing a mix of Banded, Bronze, and a few <br/>
magic pieces (spiked leather colar, etc). And I was well equiped (due to<br/>
<br/>
being a merchant bard).  I was able to get full steel by 29th.  Again on<br/>
a <br/>
mature server it is not uncommon to see bronze sold for as little as 1<br/>
plat <br/>
per AC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of sounding like an old coot, you youngins today do not know<br/>
how <br/>
easy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>
And the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by <br/>
added.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220<br/>
plat <br/>
on a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the<br/>
Dragoon <br/>
Dirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat,<br/>
<br/>
aarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though<br/>
:)<br/>
