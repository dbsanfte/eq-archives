<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-796946825">My spell effects icons have never flashed when the spells were fading<br/>
since I began with my bard in P4. My other characters (warrior for<br/>
example) do however. I figured it was just a bard thing.<br/>
I dont really mind though. All the flashing of our songs while twisting<br/>
3 songs would drive me nuts.<br/>
