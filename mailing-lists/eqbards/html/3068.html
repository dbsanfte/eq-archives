&gt;Also, this is off-topic to this thread, but in response to someone who felt<br/>
&gt;&#39;twisting&#39; (BTW, 10 free brownie points if you can point me to the person<br/>
&gt;that coined that term...and an evil and painful death for him..I really<br/>
&gt;dislike it) was an exploit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ehehe.  Juggling always had more charm.  Twisting seems to be the term used<br/>
here, but actually in-game people seem to use the word, &quot;stacking,&quot; from my<br/>
experiences (ie. I stacked Accelerando and Hymn as we outran the werewolf).<br/>
Maybe we should all put our heads together and come up with a better term<br/>
for this!  Then we all agree to use it!<br/>
<br/>
I say Orchestrated!  Yes, I am creating my own symphony... nah too long.<br/>
How about Jam?  As in, &quot;Jam Anthem and Purity on this one.&quot;  Ah, then I feel<br/>
like a gargage band guitarist.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, it&#39;ll always be twisting probably.<br/>
