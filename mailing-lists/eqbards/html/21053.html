<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-598017505">For group travel forget about it.  The range is so small that even manually<br/>
following the bard is near impossible with lag (warping included)<br/>
especially with SoW.  The only thing that it seems to be good for (IMHO) is<br/>
keeping the dungeon trash off the people who are meditating.  And when you<br/>
are running around solo.  It would be nice if Verant increased the range,<br/>
but I am sure we all know about Verant&#39;s priorities concerning bards.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone bother to use Clouding for group travel?  Isn&#39;t it a pain<br/>
&gt;(other than in small spaces like dungeons) to have to use manual<br/>
&gt;follow to keep within range?<br/>
