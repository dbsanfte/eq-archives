I am in the same boat - full set of bronze and encumbered without any loot.<br/>
<br/>
Dimensional pockets (magician) and Spirit Pouches (shaman) - can help<br/>
anything you carry in them is weightless.  Trouble is they go away when you<br/>
camp - so make sure they are empty.  I have even considered whacking the PoD<br/>
and camping my corpse so I don&#39;t have to hassle finding a mag or shaman<br/>
every time I enter the game.<br/>
<br/>
Play anthem or chant along with selos and it boosts str if you get<br/>
encumbered with loot.<br/>
<br/>
Ruby viel has str booster - kinda pricy but what the heck.<br/>
<br/>
If you have full bronze at your level, I would guess that money is not a<br/>
problem for you.  I am not looting any more except really good stuffs or for<br/>
some rare item - HQ LION skin for example - 3 weeks now and cant find one or<br/>
even buy one.  Sometimes when I have to beg my way into a party, I tell em<br/>
that they can have all the loots and all I wants is the xp and the rare lion<br/>
if we get one.<br/>
