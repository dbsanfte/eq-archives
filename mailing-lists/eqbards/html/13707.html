&gt; John&#39;s probably got a better handle on it than I do.  I generally go<br/>
&gt; overboard and go a magnitude up on the entire range rather than the real<br/>
&gt; range.  Means when I do a test here at work I&#39;d go up to 1000 occurrences<br/>
&gt; minimum on a % situation. <br/>

information theory, not sampling statistics.  I could grind<br/>
the equations to give you a formula for number of samples<br/>
needed to verify a x% frequency of occurrance with 95%<br/>
certainty.  I could not have told you off the top of my head<br/>
that it&#39;s roughly an order of magnitude greater than the<br/>
inverse of the frequency of occurrance.<br/>

&quot;What the h*ll is pi doing in the equation for a normal<br/>
curve?!?&quot;  (Yes, pi really does pop up in there.)<br/>
