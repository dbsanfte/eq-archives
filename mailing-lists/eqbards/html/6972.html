<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154116960">Wow, that&#39;s a lot of suggestions :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I had no problems using Pixie Strike against my friend in the<br/>
&gt;Arena a month ago.  I did not test Lullaby.  Charm does not<br/>
&gt;work well in arenas, but I hear that is because there is no<br/>
&gt;pathing in there, so your &quot;pet&quot; has no way to follow you or a<br/>
&gt;target.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t tried these songs in the arena.  When I want to duel with friends,<br/>
we tend to do it wherever is convenient, and an arena isn&#39;t usually close<br/>
by.  In non-arena settings they seem to have no effect whatsoever.  Can<br/>
anyone confirm?  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried using charm in the arena, It tended to fling my opponent across<br/>
the entire area and into the far wall with no charm effect occurring.  This<br/>
was just so damn funny, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to fix it :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I say get rid of the hit-a-song-key-to-stop-it function<br/>
 </span></blockquote>entirely.  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a very good idea to me.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll include it in<br/>
my email however, as it is a more of a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; and I&#39;d rather address<br/>
more pressing concerns first.  This will be filed for later.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Let us left-click on SoW to remove it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll definately add something regarding the whole change to SoW/Selo&#39;s that<br/>
has occurred recently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Change our levitate song so that it does not override the<br/>
&gt;levitate spell (same problem as SoW used to have).  Same thing<br/>
&gt;with underwater breathing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Makes sense, but again a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; in my opinion.  These songs (for me<br/>
anyway) are used pretty seldom in comparision with Selo&#39;s.  I can see<br/>
however that cancelling someone&#39;s water breathing could be deadly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Make the identify song party-effect, so folks without an<br/>
&gt;innate identify ability can identify no-drop items.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, a good idea.  How on earth could this be implemented?  The current<br/>
version of the song requires you to hold the item to be identified.  How<br/>
could you select which item to be identified from someone elses inventory?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Fix the bug where a charmed pet will on its own decide to<br/>
&gt;attack a player.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only had this happen twice.  I&#39;m willing to chalk this up to the<br/>
unpredictable nature of summoned pets.  Perhaps they become disgruntled and<br/>
turn on their masters or us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Let us gain safe fall skill at something like 1 point/level<br/>
&gt;(thus capping us at around 65 for level 50, instead of a hard<br/>
&gt;cap of 40).  I&#39;m finding myself taking damage again running<br/>
&gt;over uneven terrain with my mistmoore drum at level 35.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can add safe fall to the list of skills with low caps.  This isn&#39;t a big<br/>
deal though.  Even a low-capped safe fall allows us to take less damage from<br/>
a fall than the average person.  A bard with a safe fall skill of 40 will<br/>
take less damage from the same fall as another character will.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our dodge skill caps at 125.  A cleric&#39;s dodge skill caps at<br/>
&gt;80.  I understand not giving us parry and riposte since we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;not true tanks, but capping dodge at 125 makes us little<br/>
&gt;better than clerics at tanking.  Surely a class whose primary<br/>
&gt;means of attacking is melee would know a lot more about<br/>
&gt;defensive melee than a cleric?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would be nice.  This could be asking too much though.  Again, I will file<br/>
this for use in a future email, unless there is an overwhelming demand for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Either make our invisibility song make us completely invisible<br/>
&gt;(no glowing ball), or make the glowing ball for this song last<br/>
&gt;longer so that we can take advantage of it to coordinate party<br/>
&gt;movement while invisible (what GZ suggested we do last time).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;ve already said they won&#39;t change this.  This is a no win situation.<br/>
Some people want no glowing ball so its useful in PvP, others want a<br/>
permanent glowing ball so its easy to follow.  How to decide?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;State whether or not Anthem/Clerity&#39;s attack speedups stack<br/>
&gt;with the enchanters&#39; spells.  I haven&#39;t found them to stack in<br/>
&gt;my tests, but some official word would go a long way towards<br/>
&gt;clearing up misconceptions (and saving me a lot of testing :-)<br/>
&gt;and letting us optimize our song selection.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done a bit of experimenting with this, (no hard numbers like John usual<br/>
extensive testing) both with enchanter&#39;s spells and built in effects like<br/>
the Mithril two-hander&#39;s haste.  There is no noticible speed up.  These<br/>
songs do not stack with other buffs, the question is does the higher buff<br/>
override, or the one used first?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Change spell behavior so that if it isn&#39;t resisted, its<br/>
&gt;effects last for at least one &quot;tick.&quot;  None of this BS where a<br/>
&gt;mob doesn&#39;t resist Lullaby and nods asleep, but immediately<br/>
&gt;wakes up to bash me.  I&#39;m pretty sure casters experience the<br/>
&gt;same problem with root.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Happens with charm too.  I&#39;ve come to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great suggestions!  Keep them coming.  I&#39;ll post a revised list every day,<br/>
taking into account suggestions that people have made.<br/>
