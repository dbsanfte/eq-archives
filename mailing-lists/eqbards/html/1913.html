&gt;I&#39;ve checked a couple of decent sources, and they disagree on what the lvl<br/>
&gt;11 song is.  I think EQVault says it&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s broken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Could someone set me straight, please (and if you know where to find it,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;d be great, too :) )?<br/>

In Kelethin you can learn this fascinating song which entrances people to<br/>
such a degree that they will like you more. Though it<br/>
will occasionally allow a Bard greater discounts on items, it is more<br/>
useful in allowing one to communicate with hostile beings. <br/>

&gt;enjoy my cleric and mage too, but bard most of all), where can I find the<br/>
