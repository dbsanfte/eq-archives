<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-789863297">There is always the option to send the Bards player guide to all the other major<br/>
EQ sites at the same time you send it to EQVault.  That way everyone has it and<br/>
you don&#39;t have to worry about EQVault&#39;s policy of not linking to other sites.<br/>
IIRC, Allakazam is also requesting that someone send in an updated bards guide. <br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I have the following EQ websites bookmarked that I check on<br/>
regular basis.  IMO, each does one particular thing better than the other sites.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EQVault-  Check here for updated game news, events, and to read the E&#39;ci message<br/>
board.<br/>
Allakazam&#39;s site-  This site has pretty good quest information if you need it.  <br/>
EQlizer-  I think this one has the best info on magic items and where they are<br/>
found.<br/>
Questors of Norrath- A Japanese website that has outstanding maps of almost<br/>
every zone.  Even if you don&#39;t need/use maps, you should check it out just to<br/>
see this guys work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have all the links on my computer at work but if someone can&#39;t find them<br/>
they can send me a private message at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bamadude@...">bamadude@...</a> and I will send the<br/>
URLs to them.<br/>

&gt; FYI, EQ Vault (actually, all the Vault sites) has a policy of<br/>
&gt; not linking to any other big message board sites (Stratics,<br/>
&gt; CON, etc).  I visit it mainly because Verant feeds them news<br/>
&gt; so they&#39;re usually the first to post it.  I would not feel<br/>
&gt; right giving them &quot;free&quot; content if they will not link to all<br/>
&gt; the other free content EQ sites out there.  You may or may not<br/>
&gt; feel the same way, but it&#39;s still something to consider if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re thinking of writing a guide for them.<br/>
