     Last night some guildmates and I decided to camp the giants in FV (it&#39;s rarely taken on The Rathe).  After breaking the camp, we settled into a nice three hour session of &quot;Pop-n-Pull&quot;, (Me-34th lvl bard, 36 druid, 39 then dinged to 40 druid, a 40-ish mage, then later a 32 druid joined us), except for one time where our puller pulled one and another spawned right in his path.  While the exp was nice, the loot was not worth our time.  All told, we came away with 1 Black Pearl, 1 Axe of the Iron Back, a Word, and a sum total of 10pp in coins.  Was I expecting Forest Loops in every drop?  No.  But to personally loot 8-9 giants and have 5 or 6 with *nothing* (no items or money) is just wrong.  From even just a coinage standpoint, I would have come out muuuuch better by far if I had just gone to SK and camped the Hermit :oP  <br/>
Is it my imagination, or did someone at Verant make a comment along the lines of loot being comparable to the difficulty of the creature?  FYI: those giants are quite tough ;o)~<br/>
<br/>
One more thing:  How much is Singing Steel going for on the other servers?  Saw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he can get 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a guild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>
