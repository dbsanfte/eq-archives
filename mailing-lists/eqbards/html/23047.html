<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003082095">First off, this may not have happened.  It was late, I was tired, and I<br/>
could be loosing my mind.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m pretty sure when I died last night I had a mace on my cursor.  I<br/>
was still in the first bubble of a level which is when I always carry<br/>
blunt, slashing, and piercing weapons to get my skills up.  After looting<br/>
my corpse, I just had slashing and piercing weapons.  My inventory was not<br/>
full (not even the main slots, let alone slots in containers) and in the<br/>
past anything on the cursor at death has gone into inventory.  I know I<br/>
didn&#39;t drop it, I&#39;ve got item dropping set on &quot;never&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So is this a bug or have I lost it completely?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Evulia, who accidentally sold her first bronze mace and has now apparently<br/>
poofed her second.</div>
