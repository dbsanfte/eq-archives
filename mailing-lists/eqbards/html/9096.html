Fighting anything that runs away in that zone is nigh on impossible.  Being<br/>
a tailoring bard and that being the only zone where I have ever seen HQ wolf<br/>
pelts, this warping is very frustrating.  Does anyone know if Verant has<br/>
ever mentioned fixing this?<br/>

rathe mountains is and always has been bad for warpers, there&#39;s a spot that<br/>
we hunt hg&#39;s at and if the monsters get to a certain little bump in the<br/>
terrain, get ready for trains of em to come back at ya... anything that goes<br/>
over this pathing location will warp away and take a long time to come back.<br/>
This is close to the hill giant hill with the 2 guards on the top. Hg&#39;s,<br/>
giant skels, lizards, cycs, basilisks, anything that goes here warps. Sorry<br/>
i dont have the loc.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone else noticed this strange warping problem lately?  I had<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; experienced it before, but it seems since the last patch, things have<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;warping&quot; out of range all the time.  I&#39;ve noticed this in the Karanas,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oasis, and even in Solusek B last night.  New bug?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I noticed a lot of people playing last night (1600+ on more<br/>
&gt; than half the servers).  Ping times and PL were fine, but<br/>
&gt; /tells took up to 10 seconds to get through.  Most network<br/>
&gt; systems are designed to dynamically respond to load by<br/>
&gt; decreasing update frequency (so you don&#39;t exceed available<br/>
&gt; bandwidth).  When that happens in a game like this, moving<br/>
&gt; entities appear to blink in and out of existence as the client<br/>
&gt; and server get out of synch.<br/>
