&gt; <br/>
&gt; There really isn&#39;t a good way to do this.   If you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; pulling, you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; taking faction hits.  There really isn&#39;t any way around it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You will rarely be getting single mobs.  Half of the mobs are <br/>
&gt; unmezable.<br/>
&gt; If it takes your entire force over 30 seconds to kill a single normal<br/>
&gt; mob...thats, um, bad.  I&#39;m not an enchanter, but mem blur <br/>
&gt; appears to take<br/>
&gt; several casts, and they never seem to know if it worked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PoG can be pretty fun.   If you want to be a puller, good for <br/>
&gt; you.   But<br/>
&gt; realistically, don&#39;t expect to do it without faction consequences.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Was wondering if there is any way for a bard to serve as <br/>
&gt; main puller in PoG<br/>
&gt; &gt; without taking a negative Tunare faction hit? From what I <br/>
&gt; have read, a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in <br/>
&gt; PoG in order to<br/>
&gt; &gt; lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for <br/>
&gt; us to remain<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun <br/>
&gt; since we could both<br/>
&gt; &gt; scout and pull.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to <br/>
&gt; cast mem blur on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option <br/>
&gt; would be for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. <br/>
&gt; This would work<br/>
&gt; &gt; assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed <br/>
&gt; the mob. Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; know if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>
&gt; &gt; In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up <br/>
&gt; playing mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but <br/>
&gt; getting to be main<br/>
&gt; &gt; scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>
