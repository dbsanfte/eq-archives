<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529991103">Anecdotal evidence suggests about a 10% increase in mana restores.  A few<br/>
messages went by about this in the past couple weeks. If there is no need to<br/>
heal or you don&#39;t have group heal yet, play the jig while your party waits<br/>
on mana restores.  Better than playing &quot;Free Bird&quot; for the umpteenth time<br/>

<br/>
		Now, on to another question:<br/>
		I had a Paladin last night tell me after a battle to play<br/>
the Jig O Vigor. I<br/>
		wasn&#39;t sure why, since Stamina replenishes a heck of a lot<br/>
faster than HP.<br/>
		And you know what he told me? The Jig O Vigor actually HELPS<br/>
INCREASE THE<br/>
		RATE OF MANA RESTORATION!  I thought at first that this was<br/>
bull, and over a<br/>
		few hours tried to test it with some mages. They all agreed<br/>
that it did,<br/>
		indeed, help (however slightly) them restore mana!  Has<br/>
anyone else tried<br/>
		this? Does everyone else KNOW about this already and I am<br/>
just now leaving<br/>
		the stoneage? Any input??</div>
