&gt; It is much more likely that there is an exp penalty for dying formula that<br/>
&gt; is similar to the exp needed to level formula. If I had to guess, the death<br/>

&gt; constant for deaths increases one level after the constant for leveling.<br/>
&gt; Theoretically ( I have not run any actual tests ) this would account for<br/>
&gt; greater exp loss after the hell level than during.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ex. During hell levels you lose {X exp * Constant} the following level you<br/>
&gt; lose {X exp * (Constant +1) } Therefore your loss of exp after a hell level<br/>
&gt; is greater than during the hell level.<br/>

my L30 death.  It does not explain my L47 death costing *less*<br/>
than my L46 death should have.<br/>
