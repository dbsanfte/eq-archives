&gt;      Now that I have learned about the enchanter speed spell line I now <br/>
&gt;      understand why it is sometimes very difficult to find a party that <br/>
&gt;      wants a bard when you go to a new zone where your not known.  I <br/>
&gt;      personally felt that the attack speed buff we provided from anthem, <br/>
&gt;      celerity etc should be one of our main attractions.  Since the <br/>
&gt;      enchanter buffs are better this is no longer the case.  (  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dunno why that&#39;d be.  The quickness and alacrity spells are<br/>
faster than Anthem, true, but they don&#39;t have any stat buffs<br/>
associated with them.  Do not underestimate the importance of<br/>
str/dex buffs.  At low levels it&#39;s not very apparent, but when<br/>
you have a +18 str buff and are past level 20, the effect is<br/>
obvious - you will be hitting for max or near max damage more<br/>
frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Quickness is also short duration, good for one battle.  I<br/>
seriously doubt any enchanter is going to be casting it on 3<br/>
or 4 tanks every fight since it costs 80 mana (one of their<br/>
most expensive spells to that point).<br/>

&gt;      downed version of the 32 level mana song.  Maybe half as effective as <br/>
&gt;      the 32 level song.  This would definitely solve the, what good are <br/>
&gt;      bards for, problem between about 15th and 32 level.<br/>
<br/>

regenerate mana and hp because you simply have more of them.<br/>
Clarity helps offset this and puts you back at the lower level<br/>
meditation/heal times.  Verant may consider it unbalancing to<br/>
provide mana regeneration at an earlier level.<br/>
