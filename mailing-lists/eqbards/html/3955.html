<div id="ygrps-yiv-867075945">Heh, maybe I will head over to the aforementioned places for a buying trip -- <br/>
someone was trying to sell medium bronze in Oasis the other day for 4pp per <br/>
AC point. ::!!!::  Damn impossible to find in places I can safely go to, at <br/>
least on Povar.  Maybe I just got bad luck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I went to the saturday night bazaar and was shocked at the prices people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were paying for bronze!  I had actually outfitted a good amount of my own<br/>
bronze from High Hold NPCs, and paid less than the poor schmos at the<br/>
bazaar!  Best check the NPCs around the area, you just may pay less than<br/>
from PCs.  (The NPCs perhaps truely understand the value of bonze, it&#39;s<br/>
junk...&gt;&gt;</div>
