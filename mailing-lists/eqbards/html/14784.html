&gt; 	A level 7 Druid, Enchanter, Paladin, Wizard, or Mage can also solo<br/>
&gt; that same yellow Giant wasp from personal experience.  Unlike Druids and<br/>
&gt; Enchanters however we cannot solo a yellow even at 15th level.<br/>

anything.  :)<br/>

Just for yucks, at level 40 I decided to see what it took for<br/>
me to solo a greater kobold (low 30s).  I&#39;d fight it until I<br/>
was at 2 bubbles, Pixie Strike and Hymn to heal up,<br/>
repeat.  It took me something like 3 and a half times doing<br/>
this before I finally killed it.  i.e. I lost 11+ bubbles to<br/>
the GK&#39;s 5.  You could double the hp I had, or double my<br/>
damage output, and I still wouldn&#39;t be able to solo it.<br/>
<br/>
First time I heard about Chain/fearing, I thought it was<br/>
cheesy.  Now I realize it&#39;s just one of the tools given to us<br/>
to help us overcome our extreme disadvantage in straight<br/>
combat.<br/>
