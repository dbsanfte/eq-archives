<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605488010">Um. On Solusek Ro, at least, Phoenix was one of the first guilds in Sol B.<br/>
For a long time, it seemed, no one wanted to go in. Phoenix helped to make<br/>
it &quot;safer&quot; by learning the zone, what dropped there, etc. And now its<br/>
popular.<br/>
So they went off and found other places to hunt (though I guess some still<br/>
go<br/>
there)<br/>
<br/>
At least at the beginning, however, Sol B did not seem to be nearly the<br/>
popular<br/>
dungeon it is now.<br/>

&gt;Trains in Sol-B?? I have been there for about a week or 2 on and off now -<br/>
&gt;learning the place (I can find pool room, window room, nobel room and the<br/>
&gt;king room, I can prolly stumble into the bat rooms to but am not confident<br/>
&gt;looking in there.  Anyhow, our Sol-B is crowded as hell and a doggy&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(greater kobolds as they are affectionately known ;p) life is about 4<br/>
&gt;seconds.  There are pullers running through the place like mad.   It&#39;s like<br/>
&gt;HighKeep all over again &lt;sheesh&gt; spawn stealers, whiners, waiting lists for<br/>
&gt;rooms, etc. etc.  Trains are only very occasional.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, that is during prime time playing hours! hehe - try going there first<br/>
&gt;thing Sunday morning.  Zone in and 3 GK&#39;s are guarding the foyer -<br/>
&gt;ugh.  You<br/>
&gt;finally band together with who ever is in the outter hall and clear the<br/>
&gt;entry point.  Woo hoo this feels pretty cool. Think about how this<br/>
&gt;place was<br/>
&gt;when the first wave of players arrived.  How&#39;d ya like to fight here in<br/>
&gt;banded armor?  Hehe - guess that an army of dwarfs were the first ones in<br/>
&gt;since they could get small bronze in Unrest.  (Medium bronze drops in Sol-B<br/>
&gt;and on a young server loads were prolly still in banded when the first wave<br/>
&gt;hit.)<br/>

&gt;		&gt;On the non-PvP servers you will not be able to start this<br/>
&gt;song if you have<br/>
&gt;		a<br/>
&gt;		&gt;PC targeted.  This got me killed twice last night in Sol B<br/>
