<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971203315">Ok children, get comfy, I feel like relating one of Knaeve&#39;s Tales of the <br/>
Ludicrous.  I usually just lurk on the list, but I have time to kill at <br/>
work, and feel like sharing.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I&#39;m grouped with a cleric doing CR after a failed Vox run.  We <br/>
had learned the hard way that 53+ clerics, even if they don&#39;t engage Vox, <br/>
still get zapped out of the zone if they get even remotely close (this was <br/>
right after the patch).  I was pumping mana and there were about a dozen <br/>
people in the room, all of whom, by pure coincidence, were casters.  And <br/>
they were all very LOM casters since they&#39;d just been rez&#39;d.  Somehow, two <br/>
lvl 50 Ice Giants agro&#39;d on us.  I charmed one for a while and had them <br/>
duel, but I myself had recently been rez&#39;d, so I ran out of mana.  The <br/>
casters, using what little shred of mana was left, reduced one to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
Thus began The Bardic Prize Fight of the Century (may it never be repeated).<br/>
<br/>
The bad news:  I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY CHANTS MEM&#39;D!!!<br/>

The good news: I had VoV, Niv&#39;s, and CoB mem&#39;d from working with some <br/>
melee&#39;s earlier to clear out the king room as we worked back mostly naked to <br/>
the CR (the other melee had left, and as I&#39;ve stated, I was the ONLY melee <br/>
in this room of OOM casters).<br/>
<br/>
The other good news: I have Sionachie&#39;s Partisan (only one on Quel server to <br/>
my knowledge... I&#39;ll tack the stats to the end of this post) which I&#39;m very <br/>
fond of.<br/>
<br/>
So I start to melee this frigging lvl 50 ice giant while everyone med&#39;s <br/>
furiously.  Everyone who could heal had me targeted and so I would <br/>
periodically get incoming greater heals.  Every once in a while a caster <br/>
would get enough mana for a nuke--but by some freakish chance everyone was <br/>
getting horrid resists & partial resists.  And the fight went on.  And on.  <br/>
And on.  While I tanked, twisted, and meleed the huge bastard.  AFter about <br/>
two minutes, the cleric I had been mana feeding earlier asked how stamina <br/>
was doing.  &quot;Out.&quot;  So he shot me a bar of stamina.  It was sort of like the <br/>
people on the sidelines of the marathon handing a cup of gatorade to one of <br/>
the runners.  It took 5 minutes to kill him.  Over that period I was <br/>
probably the recipient of 30 greater heals.  It was one of the most <br/>
ludicrous settings I&#39;ve seen--all these powerless casters watching the lone <br/>
bard take on something with maybe 8-10k hp.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say, me and the one person I was grouped with (cleric) got the <br/>
xp for the kill.<br/>
<br/>
Knaeve, blah blah blah blah blah.<br/>
