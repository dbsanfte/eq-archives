<b>Subject:</b> Are we Hybrids? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-231646052">This is a repost of something I posted to the GZ questions thread.<br/>
I think we should be re-classed as casters, much like Shamans and Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to burn me at the stake for being a heretic, but some good logical<br/>
responses would be nice as well :)<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
I&#39;d like to pitch in my two coppers on the Binding Issue.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the Dev Team feels that the current bind status (Hybrids and<br/>
Melee classes don&#39;t get it) is unlikely to change and is well balanced.  For the<br/>
most part I agree.  However, I&#39;d like to argue that the Bard shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
classed as a Hybrid.  Sound crazy?<br/>
<br/>
Hybrids are Warrior/Pure Caster combos.  They get some melee skills in addition<br/>
to the spells from a specific casting class.  IE Rangers get Warrior skills and<br/>
Druid spells.<br/>
<br/>
Our spells are unique in that they may mimic some existing spells, but they do<br/>
not come from any particular casting class.  We are a casting class unto<br/>
ourselves with completely different spells and casting structure.<br/>
<br/>
To be a Hybrid you must be part Melee class (Warrior, or in our case Rogue) and<br/>
part caster.  We&#39;ve got the caster part down, but where is the Melee part?  We<br/>
get Plate, but so do Clerics.  Everyone gets Dodge.<br/>
<br/>
If you skip dodge, what Melee skills do the Hybrids get?<br/>
<br/>
Ranger - (7) Kick, Taunt, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Disarm, Riposte<br/>
Paladin- (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Riposte, Disarm<br/>
SK - (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Reposte, Disarm<br/>
Bard - (1) Dual Wield<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, the other Hybrids really are part fighter and part caster.  In what way does<br/>
ONE melee skill make us part fighter?  In addition, all other Hybrids get<br/>
Archery except Bards.<br/>
<br/>
I fail to see how we can be classed as Hybrids at all, and feel that the<br/>
addition of a personal Bind song to be in line with the current Bind thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re to have the disadvantages of a Melee Hybrid, shouldn&#39;t we get the<br/>
skills to compensate? If not, shouldn&#39;t we get the pure caster perks?<br/>
<br/>
So far, we have a stick with 2 short ends :)  Thanks for the time...<br/>
