yeah, we were at TRF.  Main stuff went on back behind the Italian Village,<br/>
in the King&#39;s Feast area.<br/>
Friday night, we went to the BBQ place, Hickory Hollow or some such in<br/>
Magnolia.  Saturday was the costume contest, talk with Verant, and such.<br/>
Sunday, we had a live action quest, went well despite the rain.<br/>

there should be news up at the Official EQ site, and eq.stratics.com in the<br/>
next couple of days (probably with a better transcript of what was said<br/>
about bard songs, as well as a lot of other issues).<br/>
