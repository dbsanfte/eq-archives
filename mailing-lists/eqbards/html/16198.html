<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378334637">I&#39;m glad you guys are so high on necros, since in my Thurs group, our<br/>
former druid (who is now 14 levels ahead of us) made a necro to group<br/>
with us.  I had thought a mage would do better in our group (DD/ fire<br/>
shield vs DOT/snare), but he wanted to play a necro more...<br/>
