song pulses and client refreshes, it&#39;s possible the jig causes<br/>
the client to refresh mana pulses at 6 second intervals (what<br/>
my friend timed), but makes no difference in terms of overall<br/>
regeneration time because the server is still using the 8<br/>
second intervals.  i.e. if you start the Hymn, stop it, and<br/>
start it again, and look at your hp, you&#39;ll see it go<br/>
pause-up-down-up repeat, which I&#39;ve concluded is due to the<br/>
client and server going out of synch.  The same thing could be<br/>
happening with mana, only you don&#39;t have the numbers that make<br/>
it obvious that this is what is going on.<br/>
