take like 5 minutes to zone.  It&#39;s about 15 with Accelerando<br/>
and a drum, about 20-25 without any speedup (haven&#39;t timed<br/>
that).<br/>

45 minutes I can probably make it from Freeport to Qeynos<br/>
without any speedup.  With Accelerando, it&#39;s closer to a half<br/>
hour.  Going through all of Oasis is 75 seconds with<br/>
Accelerando.  BB docks to Kaladim is 65 seconds.  The world is<br/>
not as big as most people think, it just feels big because<br/>
they find travel boring.  This is why I still despise the<br/>
boats (though they thankfully added a second boat to the FP-BB<br/>
run).  In the time it takes me to wait for and ride the boat,<br/>
I could&#39;ve run through 4-6 zones.<br/>
