<div id="ygrps-yiv-614668714">I assume you intended to say &quot;reels in pain&quot;, which off the top of my head I<br/>
think is the message you get when you bellow.  DDD and CoD gives you the<br/>
&quot;wince&quot; message.  You mentioned you were in Highkeep fighting the pickclaws.<br/>
Probably don&#39;t need to tell you this, but singing DDD or CoD in the basement<br/>
will sometimes, due to the z-axis bug, affect get the guards who are on the<br/>
floor above you.  Learned that the hard way last time I was there.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>
puts a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>
memorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume just<br/>
because you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was in<br/>
the Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping along<br/>
the wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in every<br/>
fight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>
muddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone of<br/>
them starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>
affected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>
Verant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>
reducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>
