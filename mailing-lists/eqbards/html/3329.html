lute.  If everyone in a full party is wounded, Hymn would be<br/>
healing 54 points every 6 seconds.  If the mob swings every<br/>
3.0 seconds on average for 27 points damage per hit (factoring<br/>
in misses and double attacks), your party is effectively<br/>
taking *zero* damage.  Part of the challenge in playing a bard<br/>
IMHO is recognizing little nuances like this and learning<br/>
which situations call for which songs.<br/>

stated that bards are balanced with twisting/weaving/juggling<br/>
in mind.<br/>
