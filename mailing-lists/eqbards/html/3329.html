&gt; level the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>
&gt; average monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>
&gt; it, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>
&gt; attack rate, so therefore they do more damage.  <br/>

lute.  If everyone in a full party is wounded, Hymn would be<br/>
healing 54 points every 6 seconds.  If the mob swings every<br/>
3.0 seconds on average for 27 points damage per hit (factoring<br/>
in misses and double attacks), your party is effectively<br/>
taking *zero* damage.  Part of the challenge in playing a bard<br/>
IMHO is recognizing little nuances like this and learning<br/>
which situations call for which songs.<br/>

<br/>

stated that bards are balanced with twisting/weaving/juggling<br/>
in mind.<br/>
