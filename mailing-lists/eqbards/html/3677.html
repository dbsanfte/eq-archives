<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The only possible detrimental effect I see of levitate is if you are<br/>
&gt; swimming, and suddenly levitated, wouldn&#39;t you pop to the <br/>
&gt; surface?  Since<br/>
&gt; EQ apparently has a major problem with distinguishing <br/>
&gt; vertical difference,<br/>
&gt; any creature on the bottom of the ocean can attack you as <br/>
&gt; though you were<br/>
&gt; standing on it&#39;s head.  Very annoying, because that means <br/>
&gt; that you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; attack it, but it can attack you.  *ahem* Nice double standard here,<br/>
&gt; programmers.  Can I report a death like that as a bug, since <br/>
&gt; obviously, the<br/>
&gt; monsters are exploiting it...<br/>
