<div id="ygrps-yiv-773582363">I&#39;m annoyed by whiners (usually enchanters) who through fits whenever a<br/>
single mezzed mob is awoken - who start ranting about using assist.<br/>
Usually<br/>
you can get a feel when you have people who are less than competent and<br/>
when<br/>
/assist is bugged...<br/>

Heh, hints that /assist is bugged:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Three battles ago the bard said &quot;Sorry I jumped into melee so late,<br/>
/assist didn&#39;t give me a target and I was too focused on singing to notice&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2.  Two battles ago the druid said &quot;can&#39;t /assist!  Imp or Elemental??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3.  After the last battle the druid called for a time out to see if she&#39;d<br/>
misspelled the puller&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but those are subtle hints.  I can fully understand why I&#39;d get yelled<br/>
at for bellowing in the wrong direction.<br/>
