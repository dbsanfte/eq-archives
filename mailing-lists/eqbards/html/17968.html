<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088994612">Actually I believe this must have changed this patch.  It was giving<br/>
messages as of the previous patch, but I only saw them twice when I didn&#39;t<br/>
re-Chain the mob.  It was always lasting for the full duration basically and<br/>
that was on blue to yellow cons.  I was using it yesterday on green cons and<br/>
it was wearing off early fairly often.<br/>
<br/>
A week ago I could keep high blue gargoyles continuously chained with a 3<br/>
song weave, yesterday I couldn&#39;t always keep mobs 10 levels below me<br/>
continuously chained.<br/>

Hey,<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many times<br/>
it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>
not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of the<br/>
powers that be.<br/>
