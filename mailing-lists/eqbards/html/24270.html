<div id="ygrps-yiv-413183739">live tower in lower guk isn&#39;t bad experience.  kunark just isn&#39;t that great<br/>
for exp relative to old world because the mobs are generally much tougher<br/>
than the equivalently levelled mob in the old world.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m not sure on the soloing thing, mostly because i don&#39;t know how well<br/>
twilight works.  i know with Song of Twilight i was able to solo karnors mobs<br/>
at level 54 by pausing the fight and twisting song of twilight, hymn, nivs and<br/>
then restarting.  if pixie doesn&#39;t work well enough for that, you may just be<br/>
stuck with the outdoor mobs in dreadlands.<br/>

&gt;We tried Dreadlands, mobs too low blue to get good xp, hit really hard.  Sol<br/>
&gt;b was great and would still be good except for the crowded factor and I dont<br/>
&gt;think I can solo bats, even if I get a solo pull.<br/>

&gt;GD is too green, as is EW.  Let me know your ideas please :)<br/>
