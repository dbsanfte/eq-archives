<div id="ygrps-yiv-246340045">The relative difficulty of getting into a group is a topic of discussion<br/>
with guildmates and others.  I think it is an interesting observation of the<br/>
effectiveness of the classes, and population, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;friends/guild&quot; issue is really a non-starter.  It&#39;s obvious that your<br/>
friends will want to group with you.<br/>
<br/>
However there&#39;s a lot of issues at play.  For bards, the pre-/post- 32 issue<br/>
is a major factor.  I think someone here complained of grouping at 30.  Once<br/>
you get the Clarity song - it&#39;s a huge difference.  We KNOW that caster<br/>
heavy groups will want a bard in the group - especially if there&#39;s no<br/>
enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is the quality of the player.  Beyond &quot;friends&quot; if you know<br/>
how to effectively play a bard (and if you&#39;re reading this list odds you<br/>
are).  &quot;Reputation&quot; comes to play here.  Someone playing a bard who doesn&#39;t<br/>
know what they&#39;re doing can be dangerous to a group.  This may be less true<br/>
for other classes.  (Also your guild&#39;s rep may come into play as well)<br/>
<br/>
Assuming a relatively busy zone (i.e. when there are 13 people in zone -<br/>
there&#39;s a chance there are 2 full groups only) I rarely have trouble getting<br/>
into groups with my 48 bard.  In Burning Woods the other night - I shouted<br/>
for a group - and got five invites - now three were overlaps in the same<br/>
group - but basically there were three groups that wanted me.  Hard to judge<br/>
in my case how much was desire for a bard vs. desire for ME - while I had no<br/>
&quot;Friends&quot; per se - there were a number of people I had previously grouped<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly - I hear of Druids from guild, for example complaining about<br/>
difficulty of getting into groups in certain zones.  Part of that is the<br/>
number of Druids.  I have been in Karnor - and seen 3 or 4 yelling for<br/>
groups.  Most of the time you only want one in your group - or perhaps the<br/>
group filled up.  So I argue it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t want a Druid in<br/>
Karnor - it&#39;s that - they already have one (or two!)<br/>

My point was if you are a bard you have to know people.  If you are an<br/>
enchanter or cleric or several of the other &quot;we gotta have that&quot; classes you<br/>
don&#39;t need to know anybody cause everyone wants you in their group.</div>
