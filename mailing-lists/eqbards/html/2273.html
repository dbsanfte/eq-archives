<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584258468">Selos, SoW, SoC, Consonant Chain, Snare, Enstill, Grasping Roots etc,  all<br/>
cancel out like effects, first in, first out.<br/>
<br/>
So, Selos will cancel root for any member in the party, while leaving the<br/>
root icon in place for the normal duration.<br/>
<br/>
You can also break yourself out of root indoors, by casting Consonant Chain<br/>
on yourself.  Sure, you move *very* slow, but at least you&#39;re moving..;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also blasted myself off a ledge while rooted, using Bellow.  Bought me<br/>
enough time to escape as the mobs ran around and down to get at me again,<br/>
and hurt less than the pounding they were giving me.<br/>

&gt;Hello!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>
Highhold<br/>
&gt;&gt;Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>
&gt;&gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t<br/>
been<br/>
&gt;&gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>
&gt;&gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with<br/>
Selo&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>
&gt;sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>
&gt;entire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>
&gt;lvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>
&gt;time to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One fun thing to try with a group of two or three bards is to learn how to<br/>
&gt;stack CoD. You CAN do this, but you have to time it so that the pulses come<br/>
&gt;at slightly different times. If you work it right, your opponent will wince<br/>
&gt;until he dies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Listen and Live.<br/>
