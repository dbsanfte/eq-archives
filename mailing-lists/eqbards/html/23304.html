<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028197173">Yes with the RIGHT group (ie bard and shaman instead of cleric and<br/>
enchanter) and four other people who are VERY good - you can go without the<br/>
enchanter/cleric combo.<br/>
<br/>
My own personal experience with myself doing crowd control - if I don&#39;t have<br/>
either cleric healing power - or shaman slowing power - I&#39;m going to get<br/>
killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.  Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky with<br/>
the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>
Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>
<br/>
	But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...  Regardless - maybe you feel that 80 per<br/>
cent of the people in the game are mediocre.  Maybe they are - but to me the<br/>
game is about having an enjoyable entertainment experience; not about<br/>
competing.<br/>

AH HA!!!! someone finally did it and made this incredibly erroneous blanket<br/>
statement!!!<br/>
Post 50 to go to most locations is NOT in the LEAST impossible without an<br/>
enchanter<br/>
or cleric.  i&#39;ve personally done necrosis, jail, zonein, zoneout, and some<br/>
random mobs<br/>
(i.e. the right bridge after the 3 spawn) without a cleric.  hell, the time<br/>
i camped the bridge<br/>
thing i mentioned above was me, ranger and necro, just the 3 of us.  i&#39;ve<br/>
done kitchen, bar<br/>
and disco without an enchanter.  the other night i did crypt (admittedly<br/>
with 2 groups, but both<br/>
crypt guardian area and emperor area) where a necro and myself handled all<br/>
the crowd control,<br/>
even tho we had an enchanter (thnx speed, thnx clarity, hahahaha).</div>
