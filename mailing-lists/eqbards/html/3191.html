than-one-song-at-a-time.  &quot;Playing&quot; does not distinguish from<br/>
playing-one-song-at-a-time.<br/>
<br/>
And tacking on the song names you&#39;re weaving/mixing/juggling<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow you to talk about the ability in general. e.g.<br/>
compare &quot;How many songs can you weave?&quot; to &quot;How many songs can<br/>
you play?&quot;<br/>
