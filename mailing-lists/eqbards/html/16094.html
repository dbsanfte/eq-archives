<div id="ygrps-yiv-668958886">I guess that&#39;s my real problem here.  Why are bards always the ones who get<br/>
the short-shrift treatment if they really do have people there that play<br/>
them as Abashi claims?  I think its this continued treatment that points out<br/>
that bards are a second class class in a group of second class classes<br/>
(non-pure casters).  If bards and other hybrids are really so well balanced<br/>
with the pure caster classes like necromancers and druids to name the worst<br/>
examples, then what secret strategies are there that we must all be missing<br/>
that makes them so?  <br/>

Also, our guild has two necros, both have a played days to level ratio far<br/>
better than any other class in the guild.  Both can solo low reds with<br/>
little fear.  Both can take on things that I and my nearest fellow bard have<br/>
trouble taking on when we group.  Adding either of the necros to one of our<br/>
groups has proved equivalent to adding any two other characters of similar<br/>
levels.  If this isn&#39;t imbalance, what the heck is it?<br/>

&gt;   ...Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.  I believe the<br/>

&gt;   will come one or two weeks before they ship the final for release, and <br/>
&gt;   those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>
&gt;   my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my expectation too. In case people don&#39;t know, through all of<br/>
beta, right up to the last week of P4, there were only 20 bard songs in<br/>
the game. Then, just before they booted us all off to go final, most of<br/>
the current 20-50 songs went in (with huge gaps in the 40&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
Just how much testing and balancing do you think got done on them before<br/>
they got in (and no they weren&#39;t on the test server either)<br/>
