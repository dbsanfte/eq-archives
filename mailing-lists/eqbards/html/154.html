<div id="ygrps-yiv-940015984"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t know for certain if the following is true but I have read in other<br/>
&gt; places that your singing ability has an impact on this song. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe this to be true, and also for the case where you are using<br/>
an instrument.  I noticed that the effect of Chant went up as my<br/>
singing improved, and again as my skill with a drum increased (only<br/>
small improvements, mind you).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One other thing I have noticed.  The time it takes to scribe a song in your<br/>
&gt; spellbook increases based on the level of the song.  For me (6th level),<br/>
&gt; memorizing Chant of Battle only takes a few seconds but memorizing Hymn of<br/>
&gt; Restoration takes about a minute.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true.  Being of the 10th level, I am able to memorise Chant<br/>
in seconds but Anthem takes me about a minute.  Hymn of Restoration<br/>
used to take as long as Anthem does now, but it is closer to Chant<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This can be a pain in the butt since,<br/>
&gt; everytime you get killed, you have to rescribe your spells.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t you mean re-memorise?  Your songs/spells stay permanently<br/>
scribed into your song/spell book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; assume, and hope, that as your singing ability increases the time it takes<br/>
&gt; to scribe songs in your spellbook proportionately decreases.  Can anyone<br/>
&gt; provide a definitive answer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I have never had to re-scribe a song, I cannot provide help.  It<br/>
does seem to be constant, but I have purchased my songs as soon as<br/>
they were available, so if scribing was related to level, I likely<br/>
would not notice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my disappointment<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I did not purchase the Warsong, as I do little soloing.<br/>
Do not underestimate the effects of a couple of extra STR and AC.<br/>
<br/>
And RE: Anthem versus Chant<br/>
Anthem is a singing song, giving maximum benefit while swinging your<br/>
mintaur axe.  To get the most from Chant you need to equip your drum<br/>
and punch the opposition.  In a party of tanks this may not matter,<br/>
but as a person who prefers small groups (2-3), the extra hits from<br/>
my axe help lots.<br/>
Hence Anthem is worthwhile even when alone.<br/>
Also, +10 STR is great (at level 10 singing ability).<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please let me know what Warsong gives you (exactly) and<br/>
what instrument it uses?  Please include your level and skill in sing/<br/>
instrument (if any) if possible.  I am curious as to whether it is <br/>
worth the boat ride to purchase this song for the small amount of<br/>
soloing I do.<br/>
