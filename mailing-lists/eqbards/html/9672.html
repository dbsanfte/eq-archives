&gt; From: &quot;M Sanford (Maev)&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pr0teus@...">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Question to all servers once again? Has *any* imbrued armor <br/>
&gt; dropped since the patch on this past<br/>
&gt; Wednesday?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we haven&#39;t seen any yet.  we have seen magician armor, enchanter armor,<br/>
shaman armor (same as pof), paladin and cleric shields, and bard<br/>
weapons/instrument.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Regarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 <br/>
&gt; hours. And how hard is he? Does he<br/>
&gt; cast any special type of spells?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we had 4 full groups, i think if anything either 0 or 1 person died.  he has<br/>
an AoE life tap that makes it a long fight, but he is only yellow (not red<br/>
like draco) at 50.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a <br/>
&gt; single mob is pulled, and about 3<br/>
&gt; minutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and <br/>
&gt; wipe out everyone? Even with monks<br/>
&gt; feign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us <br/>
&gt; fought so to keep aggro clear, we still<br/>
&gt; get trained everytime.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we had an enchanter in dark-boned skeleton form scouting the areas for our<br/>
monk puller.  he was not KOS in this form.  i don&#39;t know if he has killed a<br/>
lot in mistmoore or not, but he said he may plan on not killing anything in<br/>
PoH in order to be able to do this for all groups he goes up with, and just<br/>
be allowed in on lottoes (lottos? hehe).  we had very few evacs, if any that<br/>
i can remember.  with the enchanter scouting and the monk feigning, our<br/>
pulls were usually 1 to 3 each time, which were all doable with another<br/>
enchanter there messing.  though i have heard of very weird pathing<br/>
problems, we had relatively good luck.  the monk did manage to get maestro<br/>
alone, with his guards it may be a very different fight.<br/>
