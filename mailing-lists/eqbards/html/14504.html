&gt;   Hopefully someone can take these picutres and move them some place<br/>
&gt;   else.  As much as I&#39;d like to keep these on our public server, each<br/>
&gt;   midnight that directory will be destroyed.  I give you all the luxury<br/>
&gt;   of seeing them on the list while I&#39;m at work ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Cute tho ;p  Maybe I&#39;ll get more fans in my club.  /snicker<br/>

Email them to me privately (and this goes to anyone) and I will upload them <br/>
for you.<br/>
