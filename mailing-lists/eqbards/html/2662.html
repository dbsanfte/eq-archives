 </span></blockquote>*shrugs* I&#39;ve only got tolerance up to about 12 or so...but I&#39;ve found<br/>
that being drunk seems to help fishing (some joke of the dev team?).  I<br/>
managed to catch 20 fish in less time than normal (even ran out of bait<br/>
and had to make my way, carefully, over to the bait shop for more).<br/>
