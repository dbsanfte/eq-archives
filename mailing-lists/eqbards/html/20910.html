Since discovering this spot, we take EVERY guild member who is 45 there to<br/>
get out of hell. It took what was the absolute worst hell level (so bad, I<br/>
almost quit) and made it seem insignificant. The only down side is that it<br/>
greens out completely by 47.<br/>

The area in question is the church, labeled 10 on the map.<br/>

i got a map, but the only time i was ever there was day one of kunark we<br/>
stumbled in the place, and just this week to pick up the medallion for my VP<br/>
key and the fang for my charasis key (same trip).  both times i was with<br/>
someone who knew the place, which i don&#39;t yet.<br/>
