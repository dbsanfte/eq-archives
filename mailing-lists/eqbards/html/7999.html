<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031371177">If the graphics (or at least some of the graphics) for male chars were such<br/>
that they appealed to you, would you play a male char?  <br/>

		Sure, EQ graphics are very sexist.  I&#39;m a female, and<br/>
knowing what I know <br/>
		about internet and RPG likely customers, I very well might<br/>
have decided that<br/>
		the current graphics were the right job decision.  Yep, as a<br/>
female.  Its<br/>
		still sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which<br/>
would appeal to <br/>
		female player.</div>
