<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-59982274"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Is all the actual nuts and bolts information you have<br/>
&gt;compiled about bards locked behind passworded sections<br/>
&gt;marked &quot;Members Only&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I may be an idiot and unable to find the information I am<br/>
&gt;actually interested in (specific tactics, song effects,<br/>
&gt;bard quests, bard only magic items, bard faction information)<br/>
&gt;and if so I apologize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if I am correct that all such information is secreted away,<br/>
&gt;then I have heard enough about the clique known as<br/>
&gt;the soerbairds. If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>
&gt;group and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>
&gt;to yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>
&gt;name of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>
&gt;that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>
&gt;public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>
&gt;to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sheesh! Now this is a rant. Not much point in having a training <br/>
academy for bards and the making everything taught in class available <br/>
for free to the general public. I suppose you think that colleges <br/>
should do away with tuition and provide their classes to everyone for <br/>
free because you can research it yourself at the public library?<br/>
<br/>
As I have said before, I have no connection with the Soerbairds and <br/>
have never even met one of their members. Their posts, however, are <br/>
informative, helpfull, well written, and never disparage others the <br/>
way that you have sir!  All of my friends report that the Bards they <br/>
have met from this guild have been kind and helpfull to all and the <br/>
organisation is a blessing to the realm of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you bashing a group like this that you know so little about? <br/>
Save such lowly behaviour for those only fit to entertain drunkards <br/>
and tavern wenches.<br/>
