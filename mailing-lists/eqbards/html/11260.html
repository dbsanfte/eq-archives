<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750179519">Just wanted to add my voice to those who&#39;ve said how easy it is to acquire<br/>
the shin gauntlets and greaves from Lower Guk as a low level bard. Took<br/>
advice from this list and went to zone 1 (on the Japanese map of Guk,<br/>
excellent drawing) and waited. BTW, Sylly, your corpse was still there<br/>
Sunday afternoon ;). Invis. works on the live frogs but not the undead, so<br/>
don&#39;t venture to or from the bedroom unless you know the path is clear. Just<br/>
be patient and shin corpses will litter the ground eventually. I saw<br/>
gauntlets everywhere. Greaves took longer because there&#39;s not as many shin<br/>
ghoul knights near the zone. Best place is the bedroom if you can get there.<br/>
A high level party, including Gymi, a very gracious Song Sister, held the<br/>
room and let me know when the greaves dropped.<br/>
<br/>
My trip would have been death-free, except for the Ghoul Lord and his pet,<br/>
who were waiting at the zone and charged me all my hit points for my<br/>
goodies. But even that had a plus, cause I got to meet Kenross on my CR<br/>
journey. Nice to meet you, Song Brother!<br/>
<br/>
Query: Looking for a replacement for my Bronze helmet, entirely for cosmetic<br/>
reasons. I&#39;m going without a head piece right now because bronze is so ugly<br/>
compared to the shin items. I&#39;d prefer a graphic-less item or a steel helmet<br/>
looking piece (Don&#39;t have the cash for actual steel right now). And I don&#39;t<br/>
care for the chain look so Black Iron Crown is out. Thanks for your advice!<br/>
