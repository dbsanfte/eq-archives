<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-373567114">In addition to the fun I had in Cazic last night, I adventured in Oggok for<br/>
a short time.  Some 30-35 level friends of mine were camping ogre bouncers<br/>
inside Ogguk.  I asked them if that was a smart thing to do so they told me<br/>
to come on inside, join in on the fun, and see for myself.  The party<br/>
consisted of a ranger, monk, shaman, two druids and me.  The ranger pulled<br/>
ogre bouncers one at a time to the Feerott zone border.  Every bouncer we<br/>
fought conned red to me but we never had any problems taking them down.<br/>
Even if we had run into trouble, the zone was just around the corner.  We<br/>
had little downtime and because we were constantly killing red mobs, the EXP<br/>
bar moved noticeably (even in a hell level).  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the kicker though.  Every bouncer we killed dropped a standard long<br/>
sword and round shield.  These are regular store bought items.  Because they<br/>
are regular store bought items, when you sell them to a merchant, you get<br/>
more PP for them than you do FS weapons.  I got 9PP for every long sword and<br/>
I think 5PP for every shield.  There is a non aggressive ogre merchant right<br/>
there at the zone.  She wouldn&#39;t trade with me as a wood elf but when I<br/>
activated the DE illusion from the Mask of Deception she would.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
try singing the Carillon to improve faction as a wood elf so don&#39;t know if<br/>
that would have worked.  Anyway, I spent about an hour there before I went<br/>
to Cazic and easily made over 75PP in no time at all.<br/>
<br/>
I had never ever considered adventuring in Ogguk before (figuring it was<br/>
suicide) but am now looking forward to trying it again.  I&#39;m relatively<br/>
broke from buying all the gems for my lambent armor so figure Ogguk will be<br/>
a great place to build up my cash reserves. <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would pass this info along in case anyone wasn&#39;t aware of it.<br/>
