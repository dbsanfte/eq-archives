match theirs by rapidly cycling you between run and walk.  If<br/>
you stop following them while stopped, you will be in walk<br/>
mode.  There also seem to be some other odd cases where you&#39;ll<br/>
switch to walk, but they&#39;re rare enough that I haven&#39;t figured<br/>
out how they work yet.<br/>
