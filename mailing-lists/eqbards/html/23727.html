people only seeing the things that upset them and not the other side.  To me<br/>
your post seemed like you did not see the point of tuning them down.  Again,<br/>
I apologize, I must have missed that in your post.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Verant history.  What other choice do you have but to trust that<br/>
they will do what they say?  Not much other than quit.  I understand not<br/>
liking the update, but some poeple get *SO* mad, it scares me.  This is a<br/>
game, nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
I for one, would rather play a slightly &quot;nerfed&quot; EQ, then no EQ at all.<br/>
<br/>
I still think the BP is overpowered the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
You need to think of what is realistic for the genre not of what would be<br/>
neat.  I wish my druid had a 1200 point DD, just like wizards wish they<br/>
could cast SOW.  Melee wish they could bind/gate.  But those don&#39;t make<br/>
sense.  Neither does such a breastplate.  At least not to me.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry, if offended anyone.  It was not my intent, just expressing my<br/>
views.<br/>
