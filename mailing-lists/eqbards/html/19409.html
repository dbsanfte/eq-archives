<b>Subject:</b> Binding in evil outpost (Overthere zone) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145971436">Has anyone tried doing this yet and survived to tell the tale?  After<br/>
discovering that I could bank/trade in the evil outpost (Mask of Deception<br/>
combined with Bristlebane worship combined with Carillon gives you amiable<br/>
faction), I&#39;m now inclined to think there may be a spot safe for us to get<br/>
bound.  Couple of reasons for this.  Aggro ranges for most mobs in Kunark<br/>
appear to be very short.  One of the entrances into the outpost is a hallway<br/>
guarded by two gargoyles.  The hallway appears to be long enough so that if<br/>
you got bound in the middle of it, you wouldn&#39;t aggro a gargoyle or<br/>
wandering guard should you get killed and reappear at your bind point.<br/>
Getting out while naked may of course present another problem but with Selos<br/>
I assume we should be able to speed past the gargoyle until safe.  Screech<br/>
and Lament and Sneak skill may also be of use in this situation.  If it<br/>
works then it might be worth the risk to get bound there versus binding in<br/>
FV and running naked through three zones (FV, Dread, FM) to get back to your<br/>
corpse.  I&#39;m willing to test this out by binding in the outpost then dueling<br/>
someone.  Also will need to make sure my guildmates are nearby in case the<br/>
SHTF.  But if someone else has already tested this then it will save me the<br/>
time. <br/>
