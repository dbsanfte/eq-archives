&gt;I know its cheezy, but at 23rd you can do deepwater goblin pets in Lake<br/>
&gt;Rathetear near the Rathe Mountains zone.  They run to you, no puller<br/>
&gt;required and you can solo them with the all instrument attack.  For me 20-27<br/>
&gt;were the worse levels, I felt like I was useless (MM fustration, lack of<br/>
&gt;good groups, as has been said the learning curve part, a/k/a dying, sucks)<br/>
&gt;because I was reduced to doing the pets.  But I got over it and just<br/>
&gt;grounded out 25-27 there, at 27th I hit Cazic (*love* that place, TR is one<br/>
&gt;of the best camps peroid), at 32nd I hit upper guk (a vastly untapped pit of<br/>
&gt;xp), at 35 the BR to get over hell (did it in 2 night ;), at 37 (did 36th<br/>
&gt;the same night) the undead tower and from there on out the live keep and<br/>
&gt;usual named undead froggies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Isn&#39;t it funny now that I think about it to see the &quot;lguk&quot; people and the<br/>
&gt;&quot;solb&quot; people? =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, this no longer works.  They caught this exploit and nerfed it two <br/>
patches ago.  Now when you get a pet, you get the goblin to go with it *yuk*<br/>
