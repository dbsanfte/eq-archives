<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103051493">Hehe - the DoT from Fufils - is minimal at best.  To me the MR debuff from<br/>
it was what attracted me to its use - we were fighting stuff that had high<br/>
resist rates - ie my bellows were getting resisted so I figured other<br/>
caster(s) were facing same problem and maybe my de-buff MR would help. <br/>
<br/>
The DoT may take 10-15 seconds to complete but the MR debuff lasts for 2<br/>
pulses or 6 seconds.  To maintain MR debuff long enough for the caster(s) to<br/>
receive benefit - bard would have to keep pulsing - which is what I meant by<br/>
constant singing. <br/>
