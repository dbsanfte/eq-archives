&gt; &gt; Of course, playing a bard when your party is mob-chasing is<br/>
&gt; &gt; dangerous at best - everything that is not being attacked by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the party (and in a good party I believe this will be everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; except the ONE creature being attacked) will attack the bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, they really need to tone this down.  I&#39;ve had monsters<br/>
&gt; that other people were attacking (people not in my party and<br/>
&gt; lower level than me) break off their attack and come attack me<br/>
&gt; for simply walking by with Accelerando or Restoration playing.<br/>
&gt; When our party got squashed by a wandering sand giant, it hit<br/>
&gt; me first instead of the clerics who were sitting and<br/>
&gt; meditating.<br/>

commander when were trained with a bunch of guards and extremely green<br/>
gnolls.  These gnoll started attacking me.  After finishing them off<br/>
another train of four was chasing someone and they all turned and attacked<br/>
me.  This was without me playing a song.  I can understand why they would<br/>
hate you when you are singing.  You are basically a spell caster that is<br/>
casting everytime they check for targets.  And we know how much Mobs hates<br/>
casters.  The worse that has happened to me occured in Crush.  I am<br/>
standing around and then I see Dvinn, Emperor Crush, the Prophet and<br/>
Darish run by me.  I think hey I am safe, they are chasing someone.  Next<br/>
thing I know I am loading the zone and I find that all of them turned to<br/>
me and began clobbering me.<br/>
