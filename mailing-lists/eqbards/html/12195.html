spent about 12 hours straight here and got 3 bubbles worth of 40<br/>
experience.  Granted it was a four man party operating in a near-deserted<br/>
zone, but it&#39;s a great spot for experience nonetheless.  Cazic-Thule<br/>
groups will usually run a line policy, which is a bit of an annoyance, but<br/>
if you can find something else to do in the meantime, it can be<br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
