<div id="ygrps-yiv-885341200">a duel-wielding dojorn is just nuts.  this was my first trip there, so i was<br/>
learning.  weird how his aggro works.  we only had to deal with one<br/>
bladestorm and the noble.  i think the other bladestorm got stuck the night<br/>
before when we tried.  so i dunno what to do if both bladestorms are up.<br/>
after a couple failures we did come up with a good plan that worked.  we had<br/>
about 5-6 groups up there.  1 group attacked the noble and the rest attacked<br/>
the BS.  once the group who attacked the noble died, he unaggroed, and we<br/>
took out the BS a lot easier than with the noble tearing up everyone.  after<br/>
we figured that out, we failed on the noble again.  we had everyone wolfed<br/>
and shrunk and fought outside the windmill.  but the pathing was too screwy<br/>
and a lot of people complained that they couldn&#39;t hit him while shrunk.  the<br/>
last time we did it right.  we did not shrink, everyone was wolfed and had<br/>
naltron and rune 3 (along with all shaman/cleric buffs, etc.) and we fought<br/>
inside the windmill.  it kept him fairly contained, while outside he was<br/>
moving too much.  and surpisingly 24 out of 36 people lived (i was SO close,<br/>
died when he was to the left of the N in Noble, barely any red left).  was a<br/>
lot of fun, i am glad i stuck it out.<br/>
