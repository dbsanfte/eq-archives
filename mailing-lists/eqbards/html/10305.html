<div id="ygrps-yiv-464065498"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; than the damage it does.  I was wondering what<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s opinions of it are.  I&#39;m thinking it would be<br/>
&gt; great in a group and pretty awesome solo.  Yet i never<br/>
&gt; hear anyone talking about twisting it in.  If you do<br/>
&gt; twist it in, what do you end up twisting it with?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Both damage shield Psalms are extremely nice to use<br/>
  in heavy mob attacks against a full group.  The songs<br/>
  grant infra (Warmth) and ultra (Cooling) visions, and<br/>
  also increase the appropriate resistances.  By shielding<br/>
  your group from multiple monsters, you can inflict huge<br/>
  dmg while killing them one at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
  Soloing with it is tough because you probably want to<br/>
  concentrate on speeding yourself up, while slowing down<br/>
  the enemy.  Twisting it in (if possible) might help I<br/>
  would imagine.  It would be particularly effective against<br/>
  npcs that hit very fast.  Any creatures wielding daggers<br/>
  or rapiers would essentially kill themselves on your dmg<br/>
  shield along with you whacking them.<br/>
<br/>
  However, toe to toe, one on one, I would recommend at <br/>
  level 25, warsong + anthem + chains.  This would increase<br/>
  your attack and decrease the enemies attack.  Again, this<br/>
  is toe to toe, and I imagine since you are curious about <br/>
  damage shields that you would be in melee range.  Otherwise,<br/>
  you could creatively kite an npc with selos+bellow or chains+<br/>
  bellow.<br/>
<br/>
  I found it extremely difficult to solo monsters at L25, and<br/>
  get decent exp from things.  Around this level I hit highkeep<br/>
  and powerlevel&#39;d off of pickclaws.  Extremely good exp even<br/>
  in full groups with people 5 levels over you.<br/>
<br/>
  Just my opinion, for you sensitive bards on the list.<br/>
