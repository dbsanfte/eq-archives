case I die. Relatively full suit of low-end patchwork/leather armor, a<br/>
weapon, food and water. Does the job. =) It was filled out as I upgraded<br/>
to banded equipment. The majority of the time I don&#39;t even need it as I<br/>
don&#39;t travel very far, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come in handy at some point.<br/>
