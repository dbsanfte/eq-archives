<div id="ygrps-yiv-727047963">Well, it is not really a story of sneaking in but sneaking out of an evil <br/>
city.  Here is the story of my first vist to Innothule Swamp:<br/>
<br/>
I zoned in from South Ro and walk around sight seeing.  At that time I was <br/>
lv19 so everything is green to me.  I saw this froglok for the first time <br/>
and it was conned dubious to me.  So I decided to kill one and see what kind <br/>
of faction hit it will cause me.  Well, sure enough, after killing one, the <br/>
rest are now threatening to me.  So I thought, well, I need to fix this.  So <br/>
I run around a bit and look for a Troll or something to kill.  Well, I found <br/>
one.. a green Troll Slayer!  Yay, so I whack at her and expect her to die in <br/>
a few rounds.  Boy was I wrong!  She was beating the crap out of me!  (Later <br/>
I found out that she is an NPC like Dorn who fight a lot harder than his <br/>
level)  So anyway I was down to 2 bubbles and she had still over half <br/>
health.  Time to run!  But wait.. I didn&#39;t know which way is the zone to <br/>
South Ro!  So I just follow the wall, and as I turn a corner... there were <br/>
these whole tribe of Trolls!  I came to the entrance of Grobb!  But instead <br/>
of turning back and face the Troll Slayer.. I just zone into Grobb with the <br/>
speed song.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily there is no guard inside the zoneline, so I healed and ready to get <br/>
out.  But there were like a whole family of Trolls out there.. even if I run <br/>
out they will still see me and I am not familiar with the swamp so I may not <br/>
be able to run to the zone before the Trolls cut me up in pieces.  Well, my <br/>
only hope at that time was that the Invis song will work on them!  So I <br/>
fired it up and sure enough, I walked out of Grobb unharmed! =)  So that&#39;s <br/>
my story of my only visit to Grobb.<br/>

&gt;Has anyone ever tried sneaking into an evil city using Sonorous Clouding?? <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;know there really isn&#39;t much reason to do this except for maybe the<br/>
&gt;excitemnt =) Just wondering<br/>
