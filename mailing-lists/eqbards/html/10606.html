<div id="ygrps-yiv-514353159">i did not post it, but definitely used the info.  got me a griffenne charm<br/>
in about 20 minutes.  the loc is 100,1000 or 1000,100 can not remember<br/>
which, but both are relatively close to eahc other and you should be able to<br/>
see the named treant or the pillar if nearby.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is a tip which was posted on this list a while ago (wish <br/>
&gt; I could remember who posted it,) and I thought it was worth <br/>
&gt; mentioning again. (I know it REALLY helped me when I was <br/>
&gt; trying to get my bracers.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Along the Northern wall of NK, there is a hill with a column. <br/>
&gt; This is near the named treant, and in the area where the <br/>
&gt; werewolf hunters roam. Anyway, a griffenne or a griffawn will <br/>
&gt; spawn there once every 8 minutes, and I camped the area no <br/>
&gt; more than an hour and a half for each bracelet. Anyway, if <br/>
&gt; you are on Xegony and need the /loc give me a yell in game (I <br/>
&gt; have it written down at home.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Safe hunting...<br/>
