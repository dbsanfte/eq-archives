&gt; I&#39;m just amazed Verant found a way for it not to matter all that much - as<br/>
&gt; I see these guys dead on a regular basis. It&#39;s nice to know character<br/>

the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>
will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>
source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>
It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>
because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>
endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>
