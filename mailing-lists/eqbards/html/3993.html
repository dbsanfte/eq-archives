<b>Subject:</b> Level 17 Dual Wield - need good weps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435136391">Hehe - I made level 17!  A lot of dead birdies helped!~ Made it twice<br/>
actually and some stoopid bandits didn&#39;t help there at all! Stole my level<br/>
17 they did but I made them taste Sylly&#39;s  Revenge! <br/>
<br/>
Anyways... there I was down in Lake Rathe when I realize - hey I got dual<br/>
wield now!  And my extra wep and guildmaster is back in Qeynos.  Well, what<br/>
the hell, we have run this route a few times and one more wont be the last!<br/>
<br/>
So here I am:<br/>
<br/>
base str is 82<br/>
base weight is 78<br/>
<br/>
this is with a mix of bronze and other stuff including a spiked collar +3str<br/>
(I need some str earrings - got the str rings and a ruby veil would be nice<br/>
too :-) and with a dragoon dirk and a combine ls.  I have to NOT wear some<br/>
armor to stay in an unencumbered - unbuffed state - or else my agility takes<br/>
a huge penalty.  if I can get str buffs, I switch to my derv rings for the<br/>
dexi boost.  and I am constantly begging for dim pockets and constantly<br/>
forgetting to give them away before camping.<br/>
<br/>
The combine weighs in at 5 and while it has a decent dmg/dly ratio - I&#39;d<br/>
love to have a second magic hitter that is quicker and liter.  <br/>
<br/>
So what should I get?  My piercing skill is prolly higher than my 1hs. So I<br/>
was thinking a combine dagger.  Or a whip (kewl dood sound effects &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

omw to get me corpse<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I also got sneak!  how does that work?  makes you kinda invisible?  or<br/>
changes attitude of monster? someone said you can play songs and sneak -<br/>
what about run? can you run and sneak?</div>
