&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to give my bard some method of magical attacks to<br/>
&gt;supplement his dissonance (I&#39;m currently level 11 -- can&#39;t wait until<br/>
&gt;I get below).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  How much does dissonance with and without the lute/mandolin<br/>
&gt;    at each level?  I&#39;ve heard 16 damage at level 30, but that<br/>
&gt;    doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re having a hard time getting up to<br/>
&gt;    20 in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  I took the very long trip to Innothule and spent a few hours<br/>
&gt;    killing frogloks for netted armor.  Now, mind you, I made a<br/>
&gt;    pretty good profit selling all the rusty weapons I could haul<br/>
&gt;    to Oasis, and I have an almost complete set of netted armor<br/>
&gt;    to auction off.  But I thought that having netted gloves<br/>
&gt;    (which are magical) would let me fight hand to hand against<br/>
&gt;    magic-only monsters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

for monks hand to hand attacks.<br/>

&gt;3.  Are there any weapons/armor out there that we can use as bards<br/>
&gt;    to supplement our instrumental damage songs?<br/>
