<div id="ygrps-yiv-479144324">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
As a young bard who&#39;s had her fill of lurking around here, I thought<br/>
I&#39;d venture forth and ask a really simple question!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just returned home from a long long trip to Black Burrow where<br/>
all the gnolls hang out.  Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell chuckers<br/>
recovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune just in<br/>
case we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for the<br/>
nearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.  Not the meditating<br/>
high elves oh no, ignore everyone else and straight for little old me.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m asking is ..... were they just offended by the slightly<br/>
different interpretation I placed on Selo&#39;s, or do I have some sort of<br/>
bad guy magnet attached to me!  I deliberately avoided my hymn of<br/>
restoration because I&#39;d heard they really don&#39;t like you helping<br/>
people, but does this hatred run to any kind of song disturbing their<br/>
clearly very peaceful home?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if a nice friendly L24 and up bard is hanging out here who<br/>
donated a bronze helmet to a rather under-dressed me at the docks in<br/>
Butcherblock a couple of weeks ago, can I just say thank you very<br/>
much, it&#39;s saved my life on a number of occasions :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone, see ya out there!<br/>
