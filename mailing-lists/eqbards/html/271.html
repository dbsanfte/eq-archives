<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I wish I could attribute the following piece to someone, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a name. It&#39;s a re-write of that spoken-word song on all the top-40<br/>
&gt; radio stations at the moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Congrats to whoever put it together, it&#39;s brilliant.<br/>
&gt; ---------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen of EverQuest, Use Bandages<br/>
&gt; If I could offer you only one tip for survival, Bandages would be it.<br/>
&gt; The long-term benefits of bandages have been proved by magicians,<br/>
&gt; whereas<br/>
&gt; the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will dispense this advice now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy the power and beauty of your starting statistics, oh never mind,<br/>
&gt; you will never understand the power and the beauty of your statistics<br/>
&gt; until they&#39;ve been enchanted away. But trust me, in twenty levels, you<br/>
&gt; will look back at your stats and recall in a way you can&#39;t grasp now,<br/>
&gt; how much they really affect your skills. You are not as slow as you<br/>
&gt; imagine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t worry about the MOB or worry that know that worrying is as<br/>
&gt; affective as trying cast summon a pet without the proper reagent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed<br/>
&gt; your worried mind. The kind that blindsides you at the entrance to<br/>
&gt; Crushbone on some idle Tuesday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go one place every day that scares you.<br/>
&gt; Sing (if you&#39;re a bard).<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t steal other peoples&#39; kills; don&#39;t put up with people who steal<br/>
&gt; yours.<br/>
&gt; Forage.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t waste your time on jealously, sometimes you&#39;re ahead, sometimes<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re behind.<br/>
&gt; The race is long and in the end, it&#39;s only to level 50.<br/>
&gt; Remember healing you receive, forget the kill stealers.<br/>
&gt; If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.<br/>
&gt; Keep your old weapons; throw away your old guild tunics.<br/>
&gt; Wave.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t feel guilty if you don&#39;t know what to do with your character.<br/>
&gt; The most interesting people I know didn&#39;t know at level 22 what they<br/>
&gt; wanted to do with their characters, some of the most interesting 40th<br/>
&gt; level players I know still don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; Get plenty of mead.<br/>
&gt; Be thankful for your starting food, you&#39;ll miss them when they&#39;re gone.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll play a Cleric, maybe you won&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll be a Necromancer, maybe you won&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll delete a Troll Shadow Knight at level 10, maybe you&#39;ll play<br/>
&gt; a gnome paladin for 75 months.<br/>
&gt; Whatever you do, don&#39;t congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; Your choices are based on your skills, so are everybody else&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; Enjoy your emotes.<br/>
&gt; Use them every way you can, don&#39;t be afraid of it or what other people<br/>
&gt; think of them. It&#39;s the greatest interface you&#39;ll ever own.<br/>
&gt; Roll on the floor and laugh.<br/>
&gt; Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own guildhall.<br/>
&gt; Sense directions even if you don&#39;t follow them.<br/>
&gt; Do not read Hint Books, they will only give away spoilers.<br/>
&gt; Get to know your Game Masters.<br/>
&gt; You never know when they&#39;ll be gone for good.<br/>
&gt; Be nice to your town&#39;s npcs. They are your best link to your faction and<br/>
&gt; the people most likely to give you quests in the future.<br/>
&gt; Understand that friends come and go.<br/>
&gt; But a precious few, who should, hold on.<br/>
&gt; Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, for as the<br/>
&gt; older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were a<br/>
&gt; newbie.<br/>
&gt; Live in Neriak once, but leave before it makes you hard.<br/>
&gt; Live in Kelethin once, but leave before it makes you soft.<br/>
&gt; Travel.<br/>
&gt; Accept certain inalienable truths: spells and armor will get more<br/>
&gt; expensive,<br/>
&gt; Player Killers will kill.<br/>
&gt; You too will get to a high level and when you do, you&#39;ll fanaticize that<br/>
&gt; when you were young, spells and armor were reasonable, Player Killers<br/>
&gt; were noble and newbies respected advanced players.<br/>
&gt; Respect advanced players.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t expect anyone else to support you, even if you&#39;re in a group.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you find a magic weapon, maybe you&#39;ll have a lots of platinum but<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll never know when your corpse will be too hard to recover.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t mess too much with your hot keys or by the time you&#39;re fortieth<br/>
&gt; level, you will be completely confused.<br/>
&gt; Be careful whose crafts you buy, but be patient with those who spend<br/>
&gt; time creating them.<br/>
&gt; Craft making is a form of profession.<br/>
&gt; Distributing them is done by finding several ingredients, combining<br/>
&gt; them, and selling them to other players for more than their worth to<br/>
&gt; shopkeepers.<br/>
&gt; But trust me on the bandages. </span></blockquote></div>
