<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207849203">Yes but don&#39;t ya think increasing the radius of Selo&#39;s might increase the<br/>
radius at which it agros mobs as well?  That could be why even though you<br/>
were far enough away, it no longer was far enough due to the increased Selo<br/>
radius.<br/>

On a similar note,<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in NK on my way to Halas.  I was at<br/>
the wooden bridge when a druid came running down the<br/>
road being chased by Grimfeather, a kite gone bad I<br/>
think.  I ran up the shore to the north to stay out of<br/>
Grim&#39;s aggro radius.  I also fired up Selo&#39;s &quot;just in<br/>
case&quot;.  As soon as the druid zoned Grim came straight<br/>
at me.  Not up the road and then turning toward me,<br/>
but in a straight beeline.  To make a long story<br/>
short, I went from full health to dead before I could<br/>
zone.  I was never closer than 150 yds to him before<br/>
he attacked.  I&#39;m sure glad the Taunt has been<br/>
reduced.<br/>
