<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672818601">fyi the stats on singing steel greaves are:<br/>
<br/>
AC 24 8str 8sta 8agi 8cha Effect: *drum roll* Summon Food<br/>
<br/>
nice stats and AC, but gimme a break on the effect (i may be wrong on the<br/>
stats, but the AC is right and there are defeinitely 3 or 4 stats +8).  the<br/>
cobalt (warrior) greaves have effect: invisibility on top of phenomenal AC<br/>
and stats.  what a novel thought, give a class something they don&#39;t normally<br/>
have and something they would absolutely love!  i mean so far the AC on<br/>
singing steel is better than all imbrued pieces, and seems all classes<br/>
gloves/boots/arms/bracers will have an effect and good AC but no stats,<br/>
while the legs all have stats.   and most likely the BP when someone<br/>
eventually finds one, supposedly all having effect: gate, something no melee<br/>
class gets.<br/>

p.s. no i didn&#39;t get the greaves, but i did get an RBB =)<br/>

&gt; boots and gloves<br/>
&gt; is so powerful that they made the AC lower. </span></blockquote></div>
