<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007041714">The lvl 35+ undead pop up during the night hours. Verant had implemented<br/>
this for Halloween, but the response from all the players over lvl 30 was so<br/>
positive they decided to let it stay. So during the day it&#39;s clear, and at<br/>
night it is hell on Norrath. Awesome fun though =)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and there is plenty to be scared of in Norrath, generally though we dont<br/>
have to be too worried just travelling around. It&#39;s good to be the bard =)<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t run into Grimfeather or Shadowed men yet. But even if they could<br/>
outrun a lower lvl bard, I doubt they could outrun a bard past lvl 40. Bard<br/>
speed is just sick at that point.<br/>

&gt; Hmm, my run thru Kith was in day time hours.  What is in Kith for 30+?  I<br/>
&gt; thought the Invasion was a one time thing for the PoH debut.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for faster than anything in Norrath, have you raced Grimfeather lately?<br/>
&gt; Granted he&#39;s not in Kith but he&#39;s faster than my MM drums.  Also,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.)<br/>

&gt; Kithicor scary?? Errr.....I always thought Kith was pretty<br/>
&gt; damn boring. As<br/>
&gt; for scary, who is scared when you are running faster than<br/>
&gt; anything else in<br/>
&gt; Norrath can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kith rocks now. Great outdoor zone for lvl 30+. It&#39;s about<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
