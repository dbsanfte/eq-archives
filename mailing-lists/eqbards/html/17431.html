<div id="ygrps-yiv-977834523">Okay, first of all can we say DISTRACTED?!?! I was trying to say Selo&#39;s<br/>
Consonant Chain all along, succeeded, corrected myself, I just love the<br/>
whole Fool-In-Public thing, it&#39;s my best social skill...<br/>
<br/>
Second, thanks! I don&#39;t have Pixie Strike yet but I think I will talk the<br/>
Enchanter into letting me do speed...as far as Sauri&#39;s *shudders* let me<br/>
avoid the topic of having killed the groups pets (and ending the bar camp)<br/>
as I went to log out the other night....&quot;Bad Bard! Baaaaaad Bard!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot, I will let you know how it goes...<br/>
