&gt; &gt; well, sorry to say, mister know it all, that I am a level 22 bard, and this<br/>
&gt; &gt; is my ONLY damn character. for you to go say &quot;Well, you don&#39;t -deserve- it<br/>
&gt; &gt; then&quot; is typical elitist attitude that is starting to drive me away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; this game. What gives you the right to judge me?  (Martyn)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>
&gt;   respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>
&gt;   as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>
&gt;   complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>
&gt;   that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>
&gt;   special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Despite the sniping, you&#39;re both expressing frustration over the same thing:  you are both seeing<br/>
players wearing Lambent armor at levels below those intended by the game design, and neither of<br/>
you like it.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of sounding like my (&quot;when I was a boy&quot;) father:<br/>
<br/>
When I was around level 20, tiring of wearing patchwork leather, found-ringmail and a few pieces<br/>
of ultra-expensive banded (the four Master Smiths on my server had a price-fixing cartel), I<br/>
calculated that a full set of Banded Armor would cost me about as much as it would to become a<br/>
Smith, so I made a set for myself.  That was my first sweeping armor upgrade since cloth at level<br/>
4 and patchwork at level 8.  (I&#39;m a tailor, too.)  I am now level 33, and I do not own a single<br/>
piece of Lambent.  I intend to start questing for some next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not a twinked character, and you are level 22, you cannot expect to have Lambent Armor<br/>
unless you have at least a few high-level friends.  This is irritating, sure.  (At level 33, I<br/>
get pretty irritated seeing players in their teens with better armor/weapons than I have, and I<br/>
have some pretty good ones, due to some friends semi-twinking me while I was in my 20s.)  But the<br/>
fact is that you are playing the game as designed.  If it makes you unhappy, there are things you<br/>
can do about it (joining a Guild comes to mind).<br/>
If you can&#39;t, though, you should take some solace and some pride in the fact that you are making<br/>
your way through this game the way it was intended, by earning things for yourself at the level<br/>
at which they are appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
It is not that you &quot;don&#39;t deserve it&quot;; it&#39;s that the other players you&#39;re looking at haven&#39;t<br/>
earned it.<br/>
