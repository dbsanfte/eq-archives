<br/>
We took a party to City of Mist and fought a (or is it &quot;the&quot; ??) Black <br/>
Reaver. It was a TOUGH yellow-con (to a 51) golem-like thing, 100% magic <br/>
resistant, seemed to have well over 15K hits. We are all about to rejoice <br/>
over killing it after our cleric had gone OOM from a string of complete <br/>
heals on the main tank when *poof* a NEW Black Reaver spawned from the <br/>
corpse of the old one! This totally caught us off guard. Me and the warrior <br/>
held it off while our cleric and rogue camped and the monk feigned. I died <br/>
of course. We did loot the old one and get a nice Jade bladed Axe off it. We <br/>
were again surprised when we found that the old reaver corpse had become the <br/>
home point for the newly spawned Reaver. We originally had thought it was <br/>
corpse camping. So we had the monk pull the reaver away right as our guys <br/>
logged in and ran from it&#39;s home point. The monk died tho. =(<br/>
<br/>
We used sneak/hide to get mine and the warrior&#39;s corpse to safety, and <br/>
recruited a necromancer to help fight the new Reaver. We prepped and <br/>
attacked it. The necro tried a couple spells with 100% resist (we were <br/>
hoping it might be suceptible to disease, but no go), so she just had her <br/>
pet lay into it while she twitched out cleric&#39;s mana. This time, the thing <br/>
was a blue con, and our cleric came out of the fight with 60 mana left <br/>
(post-twitching).<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit, a new mob sprang forth from the second corpse! This time it was a <br/>
yellow-con Iksar ghost named Lord Ghiosk (sp?). He had mass hp, but only hit <br/>
for 160&#39;s. Still, took all of our cleric&#39;s mana to kill him, with mrs. necro <br/>
twitching the hell out of her mana. We dropped it after what seemed forever, <br/>
and looted a Throneblade of the Ykesha. This item went to the warrior for <br/>
his hard work tanking.<br/>
<br/>
I must say, this was the most intense and exciting fight I have ever <br/>
experienced on Kunark as of yet. It ranked up there with my first dragon <br/>
slaying, actually.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I got Sionachie&#39;s Partisan this morning. Thing looks nutty. Piercing, <br/>
9/19 +6 CHA +2 INT +5 Magic. From a Caller of Sathir in Karnor&#39;s. We also <br/>
got a gold shield with a dragon emblem (I forget the name of this item) from <br/>
Chardok off an Aruspex. AC 25 plus a bajillion stat buffs. The friggin thing <br/>
is better than Bladestopper, easily.<br/>
<br/>
I think Kunark is crazy as far as loot goes, but I&#39;m stil havin a lot of fun <br/>
there. =)<br/>
