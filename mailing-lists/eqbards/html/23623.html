<div id="ygrps-yiv-290406821">In pickup groups looting rules are tough.  What happens when you&#39;re at a<br/>
camp when certain people in the group can&#39;t win anything?  I like it when a<br/>
group is doing &quot;use based&quot; loot, but often its not fair to all people.<br/>
Grouping with guild/friends is totally different.  If an item drops which<br/>
would be used by someone in the group, and its randomed, you need to find<br/>
some better friends (or a better guild).<br/>
<br/>
In a zone where spells drops, its pretty standard for the player to get any<br/>
of their class spells that drop.  The problem is mellee got hurt in these<br/>
situations.  A great solution is to have all the mellee choose a class<br/>
(which isnt in the group) and they get that class&#39;s spells.  Any un<br/>
represented class spells get randomed.</div>
