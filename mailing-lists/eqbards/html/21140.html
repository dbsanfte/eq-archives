&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too play on The Rathe, so you might find this amusing B <br/>
&gt; (seems to be a<br/>
&gt; lot of ignorance on Rathe).  Instead of boring you with a <br/>
&gt; long story I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; make it short.  I had a day in Ill Omen a month back when I <br/>
&gt; was charming.<br/>
&gt; All alone in part of the zone, I had not seen another player <br/>
&gt; in about an<br/>
&gt; hour.  I was charming mobs for one on one fights.  This <br/>
&gt; warrior and bard(of<br/>
&gt; all people!) come along and start trying to kill steal.  Now <br/>
&gt; they have me<br/>
&gt; distracted and two wandering mobs jump me.  No problem, I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; just run in<br/>
&gt; circles while charming.  They start disrupting the mobs that <br/>
&gt; are following<br/>
&gt; me by hitting the one my pet is on, by now I lose about 400 <br/>
&gt; hp because of<br/>
&gt; it.  While they are killing one of the mobs, some fool caster <br/>
&gt; trains me<br/>
&gt; with 6 mobs.  I give a real life sigh and just figure if the <br/>
&gt; warrior and<br/>
&gt; bard go away I&#39;ll just have a 30 minutes challenge on my <br/>
&gt; hands (sounds like<br/>
&gt; fun!).  Nope . . .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is the good part.  Half way through killing these I get a tell.<br/>
&gt; Warrior: &quot;If you do that again I&#39;ll have your account banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Warrior: &quot;You were charm kiting.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;Yea, since when is that against the rules?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who just tried to kill steal?  You <br/>
&gt; know that IS<br/>
&gt; against the rules, and I could petition you for it, but I am not.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Warrior: &quot;You had about 10 mobs on you.  You are hogging all <br/>
&gt; the kills.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re not even getting hit.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;Yea, because I was trained.  I usually only have a one <br/>
&gt; on one fight<br/>
&gt; until people jump in where they don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;So you are going to petition me because you&#39;re jealous?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Warrior: &quot;It&#39;s not fair, your not getting hit, so that is exploiting.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Me: &quot;Go ahead and petition then.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was on for probably another 4 or 5 hours that night and I <br/>
&gt; never got a<br/>
&gt; tell from a GM, I assumed they just laughed, if he petitioned at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ignorance at it&#39;s finest.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.  What I <br/>
&gt; found most amusing<br/>
&gt; &gt;is that folks passing by would stop to watch in amazement.  <br/>
&gt; There I was, a<br/>
&gt; &gt;lone blue-clad, green-boot-wearin&#39; bard running in big <br/>
&gt; circles with 2 giants<br/>
&gt; &gt;and an ever-increasing horde of drolvargs (mostly growlers) <br/>
&gt; not far behind.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Every now and then, one of the critters would fall over <br/>
&gt; dead.  Thinking back<br/>
&gt; &gt;on it, I have to wonder how many times I was /petitioned for <br/>
&gt; exploiting<br/>
&gt; &gt;something   heh!<br/>
