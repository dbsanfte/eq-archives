Unless they&#39;ve changed the way Maligar works, if you&#39;re 50+ (probably much lower even), you can pull all his guards single without harmony, without lull, without even worrying about it.  Get on the perimeter, move up slowly until your spell/arrow/whatever can go off and hit the guard.  he comes running, you kill him.  Repeat until Maligar is solo.<br/>

  Well Illusion Dark Elf (I am a worshipper of Erollsi Marr if that<br/>
  matters)didn&#39;t work, so I will have to get a group (need them anyway for<br/>
  Doppelganger, so no big deal) then either try to sneak up on him or charm<br/>
  him.  Our plan is to harmony him and pull the rest away for their funerals.<br/>
  Then he will be left alone without waiting for respawn...<br/>
