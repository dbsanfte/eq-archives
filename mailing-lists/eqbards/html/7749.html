<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285550225">No I never said this I said they either have to accept that this is a game<br/>
for people who have lots of time or move on. If they can&#39;t accept that then<br/>
they should move on. Stuff like the binding issue or how long it takes to<br/>
level and so forth. My point is exactly what I said read it again.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to have to agree Everquest is a game for<br/>
&gt;&gt; people who have lots of time on their hands. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; something the casual player is going to have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; either accept or move on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is your point? That people that don&#39;t spend a<br/>
&gt;lot of time in EQ should move on? I know people that<br/>
&gt;only play one hour every other day and have a great<br/>
&gt;amount of fun.<br/>
