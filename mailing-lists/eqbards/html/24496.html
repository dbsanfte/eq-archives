<b>Subject:</b> Question on Lute of the Howler and Crowd Control <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437779257">Two separate questions really. First, none of the normal sites seem to<br/>
have information on what drops a Lute of the Howler. Can anyone fill me in<br/>
please?<br/>
<br/>
Second, on crowd control, how do you fellow bards handle groups of 4+<br/>
mobs? I can easily handle mobs #2 and #3 with charm, but if no one is<br/>
smart enough to root #4 the group is in trouble. Mezz isn&#39;t reliable,<br/>
especially while trying to control a pet, and there&#39;s usually no room<br/>
indoors to kite.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
