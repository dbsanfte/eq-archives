&gt; &gt;2.  What&#39;s up with Farie Dragons?  The little guys with butterfly wings.  Are<br/>
&gt; &gt;they monsters to hunt?  Do they have a bad faction adjustment when killed.  Do<br/>
&gt; &gt;they have good treasure?  No one seems to be hunting them.  Yes they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;beautiful but that doesn&#39;t seem to stop most people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They reduce your faction with SkyTalons, whatever that is.  (Dragons maybe?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They sometimes have a gem or piece of jewelry.  No cash.<br/>

Faydark...sometimes they hunt ME!  However, the reason I hunt them is<br/>
for the cash - most I get have one or two gold on them...<br/>
