<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044979245">That would explain it.  If so, I&#39;d say that leftover bug actually accounts<br/>
for 99% of my &#39;bard hate&#39; cases, the sole exception being when I was smacked<br/>
around while not singing, casting, or anything.  Wasn&#39;t the weakest nearby<br/>
PC or anything that time.  Made no sense, the mob just left his fight ran<br/>
over and started smacking me around.  Must not have liked my auctioning.<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t had many examples of &#39;bard hate&#39; or whatever we want to call it<br/>
&gt; lately, but this was sure pretty apparent as a bizarre hate list incident.<br/>
&gt; Only thing I can figure is that somehow the code is messed up to the point<br/>
&gt; that when a song pulses, the mobs consider it cast on everything within<br/>
 </span></blockquote>its<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; radius, whether it has an effect or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A legend from early in the beta that I can&#39;t verify:<br/>
Bard songs would affect all PCs in the radius, not just the ones in your<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
When they &quot;fixed&quot; bard songs so they only affected party members, they may<br/>
have inadvertantly left the taunt factor on for all PCs.  This is probably<br/>
the reason for 95% of &quot;bard hate&quot; cases.  The other 5% are just random<br/>
attacks that are suffered by all classes.<br/>
