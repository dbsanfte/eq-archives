There haven&#39;t been very many imbrued drops on our server, so I pretty much<br/>
know exactly what exists.  All bard armor has been obtained from PoH, there<br/>
were no high level bards on the very early PoF trips before stuff got moved.<br/>
<br/>
Summary of drops to date:<br/>
Bracers - 5 - I&#39;ve got 2<br/>
Arms - 3 - I&#39;ve got 2<br/>
Legs - 3 - I&#39;ve got 2<br/>
Boots - 1 - mine<br/>
Helm - 1 - mine<br/>
BP - 1 - mine<br/>
Gloves - none<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve got doubles.  I&#39;ve been the only bard around for a lot of these<br/>
runs.  The BP just dropped this weekend, I was ecstatic.  Think we only<br/>
pulled about 3 banshees that night, and it dropped on the 2nd one.  Maestro<br/>
was also kind enough to give me an evensong that same night (which was<br/>
perfect since I already had the six note)  It was the luckiest night for a<br/>
bard ever I think.  We only got about 4 drops total, and I got 2 of them.<br/>
They really need to re-tune this zone, everyone is getting a little upset<br/>
with the drop rate (well, except the clerics since there seems to be about<br/>
20 times the number of their armor dropping mobs than everyone elses)<br/>

<br/>
&gt;on our server, legs<br/>
&gt;seem to drop more than anything else, and boots the very least.  since the<br/>
&gt;bard armor was moved to hate, we only know of one boots ever dropping<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its odd how this works...<br/>
<br/>
Three pairs of Imbrued boots dropped on our server on Saturday alone.  I <br/>
think its the one piece of imbrued that all the 46+ bards on Sol Ro actually<br/>
<br/>
have in fact.  I have seen many bracers drop in hate and in fear recently, <br/>
and arms and legs are pretty frequent as well.  I&#39;ve only seen or heard of 1<br/>
<br/>
pair of gloves and helm (and I was the only bard there when they dropped, <br/>
woo!) in the last month and a half and no breastplates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back next weekend, I sure hope the RNG changes course for me! hehe<br/>
<br/>
P.S. - John, I liked the odds for winning a 1-100 lotto, what are the odds <br/>
of rolling a 200 on a 1-200 lotto?<br/>
