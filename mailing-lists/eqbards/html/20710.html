<div id="ygrps-yiv-933853130"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well I&#39;d love to have you on Tunare, but the guild I&#39;m in <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have pondered what I see as an anti-RP pressure in EQ a lot. I think it is<br/>
because the game itself requires so much logistics discussion. Logistics can<br/>
be diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data much less gussying it<br/>
up, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends to sound pretty OOC.<br/>
Guildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there is no premise at all of<br/>
sharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location. How do you RP for more<br/>
than a short span when one person is in the Field of bone as an Iksar and<br/>
another in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>
player to quit playing a secondary and come help... Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>
possible to counter the effect, just that it is hard work.<br/>
