<b>Subject:</b> Sonorous clouding <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499744181">I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>
few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>
noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>
failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>
Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>
spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>
and saw thru their invis.<br/>
<br/>
I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>
I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>
when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>
it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>
this, please do so.</div>
