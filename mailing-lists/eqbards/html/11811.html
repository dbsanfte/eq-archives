I&#39;ve tried Kith about four different times now, and while I&#39;ve been in good<br/>
groups, not died, etc., the mob/hour and exp./hour ratio is pretty bad.  You<br/>
wait for a pull while playing clarity.  Some Ranger or Druid is out there<br/>
running around.  &quot;Inc!&quot; So you stand up, fight one blue/yellow/red mob and<br/>
then wait for another pull...  Then 7am rolls around and you *sit* for 20<br/>
minutes real time.  So all-in-all you might kill 5 or 6 mobs during the<br/>
night if you&#39;re lucky.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really seen my exp. move<br/>
fighting in the new Kith.<br/>

&gt;   Less bang for the buck.  A L40 enraged black wolf can eliminate an<br/>
&gt;   entire party of L35s.  For a group of L45s, the wolf is still a very<br/>
&gt;   tough fight.  Too tough for the exp given.  In the time it takes to<br/>
&gt;   find + kill those undead, you could have killed 2 or 3 sonic bats<br/>
&gt;   in SolB.  When 7am clicks, poof undead go ahead and you are stuck<br/>
&gt;   waiting until nightfall.  It&#39;s not worth the time spent.<br/>
