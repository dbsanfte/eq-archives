<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602985014">can&#39;t explain the cleric, but Lucan is like a 3000 point faction hit, so<br/>
most people go straight to scowls.  i know i did after my first kill.  a<br/>
dozen or so Lucans later, i don&#39;t even think i get a faction hit as i am<br/>
bottomed out.  when the dwarven ale quest was still in, i think it took<br/>
about 2000 ale to get back to dubious.<br/>
