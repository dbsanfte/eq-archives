Not certain what you are doing different but I maxed out my dual wield skill<br/>
before I ever reached 18th level.  I had a dragoon dirk  equipped in the off<br/>
hand so that helped.  I also put ten training points into it so, assuming<br/>
one initial training point gave me a skill level of 17, my dual wield skill<br/>
was 27 when I actually started using it.  Since 18th level, my dual wield<br/>
skill, as well as all combat skills,  still maxes out for my level within an<br/>
hour or so of levelling.     <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; that&#39;s ridiculous.  I have dual wield at 17th, close to the level it<br/>
&gt; starts<br/>
&gt; at I think I&#39;m at 23? in it and it goes off for me 10% of the time.  Not<br/>
&gt; that it hits for all of that 10% of the time.  Even a first level monk<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; dual wield at 10 sees it go off more than 1% of then time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; and dual wield?  If so even at dmg 2 they&#39;d be the equivalent of 5/25 or<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is a combine scimmy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what level they get the skills, but at that level<br/>
&gt; the skill is bound to be so low it&#39;ll only go off like 1% or<br/>
&gt; 2% of the time, making very little difference in the overall<br/>
&gt; damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon until 13th level<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that was a dirk at 25p.  I couldn&#39;t have afforded a combine back<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I was too busy having fun to make money ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My highest &quot;trade&quot; skill is begging, at 37.  I play the game<br/>
&gt; to have fun too.  I&#39;ve never really tried to make money.  I<br/>
&gt; guess my high charisma gave me enough of a boost with selling<br/>
&gt; prices that I had 60pp saved up by L12.<br/>
