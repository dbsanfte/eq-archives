<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856685313">I&#39;d even put the Shin Gauntlets above the elf-hide gloves, but only if your<br/>
agility and dexterity are already over 101 like mine.  I thought I posted<br/>
the test results on Dodge  that I did to the list, but will see if I still<br/>
have them at home.  Basically increases in agility showed definite increases<br/>
in successful Dodges up to 101, after that the rate of obvious change slowed<br/>
from 5 point breaks to 10-20 point breaks.  I only tested from 70 - 145<br/>
agility values as that was the range I had access to at the time.  The tests<br/>
on Parry and riposte were not helpful to us but showed similar tendencies.<br/>
There was overall a 30% difference between 101 and 70 agility in successful<br/>
dodges as I recall from memory.  145 showed only a further increase of 15%<br/>
over 101.  There was a point in there where the agility multiplier for ac<br/>
went up significantly after 101, but it was fairly high, 131 I think.<br/>

As far as getting the lambent components, I try to group with people higher<br/>
lvl<br/>
than me (as i can still be useful for buffing and minor melee damage) if<br/>
they<br/>
have an opening.  Or, yes, just hang out and try to get to loot someone<br/>
eles&#39;s<br/>
kill.  (i got the black silk gloves myself, but i was grouped with people<br/>
higher lvl than me.  28, 28, 27, 25, 24, and then me at 23)<br/>
<br/>
As far as the gloves go:<br/>
Snakeskin Gloves:  AC 4, +3 Dex<br/>
Elf Hide Gloves:  AC 4, +5 Dex, +5 Agi.<br/>
Lambent Gauntlets: AC 12, +5 Dex, +1 Cha<br/>
<br/>
[I apologize in advance for bringing up the dreaded Agility argument...]<br/>
Obviously, the Elf Hide are better than Snakeskin, but based on the<br/>
statistical<br/>
evidence i have seen, they are not ALOT better (this is subjective, mind<br/>
you)<br/>
and VASTLY inferior to the Lambent.  The only effect that agility has, based<br/>
on<br/>
the tests i have seen, is a minor increase in AC (1 AC for every 5 AGI<br/>
roughly,<br/>
though there are breakpoints [notably, agi 74 to agi 75] where it can do<br/>
more) <br/>
There have been rumors that Agility effects dodge, parry, riposte, etc, but<br/>
I<br/>
have never seen any hard evidence of this.  Based on the evidence I have<br/>
seen,<br/>
the Elf Hide gloves could just as easily say: AC 5, +5 Dex (while this is<br/>
better than Snakeskin, it may or may not be worth the associated cost...I do<br/>
not have a single plat that i can throw away, so the Elf Hide are just not<br/>
worth it.).  If anyone has any _HARD_NUMERICAL_EVIDENCE_ showing what effect<br/>
Agility has besides 1 ac from 5 agility I would love to see it.<br/>

PS- I actually saw someone trying to KITE in Mistmoore.  (around the lake in<br/>
the first courtyard)  It was one of the scariest/dumbest things i have ever<br/>
seen.  They died.<br/>
