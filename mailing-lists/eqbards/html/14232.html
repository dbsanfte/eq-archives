<b>Subject:</b> Gnoll Hide Lariet - Secret nerf? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-265050507">I got my first one a couple weeks ago and my second one last night.  I used<br/>
it at first just to try it out and I liked the speed.  I saw the &quot;you don&#39;t<br/>
have the will&quot; message frequently (I am only 21, it procs at 25).  Well, I<br/>
put it back in to the bank for a while.  The other day I brought it back<br/>
out in place of my tentacle whip because it is a difference of 2 or 3 in<br/>
weight and I was on a fairly strict weight limit.  As I used it over the<br/>
next couple hours I didn&#39;t see a single &quot;will&quot; message.  I dual weiled the<br/>
GHL last night for about 20 minutes and still didn&#39;t see any messages.  The<br/>
other day I heard the Mistwalker&#39;s procs were nerfed to %25 of what it was.<br/>
 Does anyone know if the GHL has been nerfed also?  I enjoy the speed of<br/>
them, but if they are nerfed they become rather usless with a base of 3 damage.</div>
