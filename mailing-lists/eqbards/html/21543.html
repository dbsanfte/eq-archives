<div id="ygrps-yiv-268782115">Hmmm... went by Allakhazam&#39;s and they have no info on the quest... how odd.<br/>
<br/>
First thing&#39;s first, you must get a Star of Odus (buy it) from the jewelry<br/>
shop in Erudin.  Turn it in to the *MALE* banker in FV.  He will then give<br/>
you a 6-slot container with a combine button for the coins.<br/>
Since you already have the ones from Dalnir&#39;s and Kaesora, we&#39;ll skip those.<br/>
City of Mist- One drops from the Captian of the Watch (or something like<br/>
that, I lost my detailed list :o/ )<br/>
Emerald Jungle- Must be Foraged for.  Grab a nearby druid and exchange a lil<br/>
mana for the foraging ;o)<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen- The Bloodgill gobbies in the lake (look at the base of the<br/>
pillars around the center of the lake) carry these, and are probably the<br/>
toughest creatures you&#39;ll have to fight in this quest.<br/>
The Overthere-  Check out the big pit in the center of the zone and kill a<br/>
scorpoid (can&#39;t remember the exact name, but it&#39;s the rarer of the two kinds<br/>
of scorpions in the pit).<br/>
-all of these coins are fairly common drops-<br/>
Put them in the box the banker gave you, hit combine (now it looks like a<br/>
treasure chest), give it to him, and Voila!  you have a Nostrolo&#39;s Tamborine<br/>
(and you will notice the difference IMMEDIATELY).<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  Make *SURE* you have an empty spot in you general inventory for when<br/>
he gives you the box for the gem (not sure about the tamborine, but always a<br/>
good idea).  If your inventory slots are full, you will get the &quot;dropped to<br/>
the ground message&quot; but the box will be gone (ie: time to head back to<br/>
Erudin again).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
