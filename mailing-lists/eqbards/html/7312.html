&gt; That&#39;s not accurate - Sierra Online IS going through re-structuring and are<br/>
&gt; closing the office where the team that was developing it - they claim that<br/>

What I heard was that Sierra canned the original concept of a<br/>
low-magic, harsh death world in-line with the Tolkien books.<br/>
And instead they&#39;re shooting for a high-magic lenient-death<br/>
world - i.e. a UO/EQ/AC clone.  This decision has supposedly<br/>
led to the entire original design staff opting not to stay<br/>
aboard.<br/>
