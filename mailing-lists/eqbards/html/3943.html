<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496727633">As I mentioned a bit ago, I&#39;m playing on the Test Server now (as Talies, a<br/>
Half-Elven Bard, naturally.)   One thing I noticed right off - there&#39;s a<br/>
LOT higher percentage of Bards on the Test Server, vs. other servers I&#39;ve<br/>
played on.  I didn&#39;t have to wonder too long, either - as soon as I made<br/>
6th level, I found just how powerful I really was!  Fighting yellow-to-me<br/>
Gnome Enchanters, while their spells would waste me pretty effectively, I&#39;d<br/>
just run in, wail on their pet, wail on them and then back off - they&#39;d<br/>
always run out of mana before they could finish me off, and then run away<br/>
while I dealt with their pet.  Rather then following, I was retreating and<br/>
healing - I healed faster than they could possibly gain their mana back<br/>
especially since they were running away)  And since the most common PvP<br/>
tactic is &quot;Root&#39;em and Pummel&#39;em&quot;, I&#39;m pretty well immune to that.  I am<br/>
*NOT* immune to fear, charm or other annoying &quot;Take control&quot; things (as I<br/>
learned while trying to test a potential bug.*)<br/>
<br/>
Now understand this: I never provoked any attacks.  I always went in<br/>
unarmed, greeted them warmly, and even if they attacked me, I asked them<br/>
not to, then warned them to stop interfering with the mail (I was on the<br/>
FedEx Quest).  Finally, I&#39;d have to whip out the sword, and go at it.  The<br/>
first time I did that was to a necromancer, she and her enchanter buddy<br/>
were wailing on me for all they were worth (1 pt, 2 pt, miss miss miss),<br/>
and saying how fun it was, and &quot;En Guarde!&quot; etc.  I was laughing at the<br/>
computer watching this, but I had to keep saying things like &quot;Don&#39;t make me<br/>
hurt you...&quot;  So finally, I drew my Fine Steel Longsword, and swung at the<br/>
necromancer (who&#39;d been draining my health). *crunch* 12 points.  Not much,<br/>
true, but she panicked &quot;RUN AWAY!!!&quot;  Her buddy left me his pet and fled,<br/>
and would go a little ways, cast choke on me, then summon another pet.  It<br/>
was funny, really.  I killed three of his pets before catching up to him at<br/>
the entrance to Ak&#39;anon where he begged for backup.  3 Spellcasters, all<br/>
hitting me, and I *STILL* got the enchanter down to less than half a<br/>
bubble, doing the death crawl to get away.  I was hurting m&#39;self, and<br/>
didn&#39;t really want to kill him, so I turned, kicked in Selo&#39;s and<br/>
high-tailed it out of there.  Nearly died anyway, to a nicely timed and<br/>
well executed backstab, but fortunately, the Hymn twisted with Selo&#39;s saved<br/>
m&#39;life.<br/>
<br/>
Now THAT&#39;S a great one to tell the grandkids.<br/>
<br/>
Word of warning to would-be travelers: Faction hits *are* implemented, and<br/>
they look functional.<br/>
