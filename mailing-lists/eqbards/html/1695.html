<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lement <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382674259">If you have 4 mobs in a camp that con blue or greeen you individually lament 3<br/>
of the mobs that you don&#39;t want to fight, then attack the forth and back way<br/>
off. I usually intitiate with bellow so that I don&#39;t have to stand very close.<br/>
If you fail to lament any of the mobs, that mob will immediately attack you just<br/>
like you&#39;d bellow&#39;d it, and very likely it&#39;s friends will come with it if they<br/>
are close enough to the offended mob. Make sure you are lamenting with your lute<br/>
equipped (stringed song) so that you get the extended duration. I can actually<br/>
lament 4, but sometimes the first wears off too soon, so I go with three. I have<br/>
never had a green mob resist the lament with my lute equipped, even if it conn&#39;d<br/>
as a tough green. Blues will occasionally resist it if they are the higher level<br/>
ones, and withblack/white cons I would expect a resist.<br/>

&gt; I know that this song has been talked about a whole lot...but sadly i missed<br/>
&gt; all of it. All I want to know is how you can take out a whole camp using it?<br/>
&gt; I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs in east<br/>
&gt; commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the song on one and<br/>
&gt; then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs followed. Can<br/>
&gt; somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>
&gt; Thanks... </span></blockquote></div>
