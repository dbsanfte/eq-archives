<div id="ygrps-yiv-198388957">I have an idea here.  I did a bit of exploration just last night with my<br/>
Bard, scouting areas for my level 30 Enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Frontier Mountains is full of these little digger creatures (burynai) that<br/>
are low 30s, they should be blue, white/black and yellow at 30.  There are<br/>
also some Mountain Giants and Brutes that are 30s.  These things look like a<br/>
whole lot of fun to fight.  There were only 4 or 5 players in the zone when<br/>
I was there, basically just folks moving through the zone, but there were 35<br/>
or so in the Lake of Ill Omen right next door, grab some of them and try the<br/>
Mts.  I was told by one Druid friend of mine that pulling in the mts. is<br/>
difficult because of the steep terrain and many trees, that you can easily<br/>
end up with more than one, so finding a pull spot with a good field of<br/>
vision is important.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO.  Just for grins I went into the Mines of Durga which has a zone<br/>
entrance in the Frontier Mts.  It&#39;s a goblin mine with a few of these digger<br/>
creatures waaaaay in the back.  Everything seemed to be 31 to 35 or so<br/>
level-wise with a few of the goblins being Necros and Shaman, even the lone<br/>
Magician every once in a while.  There are a couple of reasons why I&#39;m very<br/>
excited about this place for low 30s players and plan on taking my 30-35<br/>
group there tonight.  The first thing recommending it is that nothing saw<br/>
through my bardic invisibility the whole time I was in there, not one single<br/>
thing.  This is a real treat in Kunark where EVERYTHING tends to see through<br/>
invisibility at level 30+.  The second thing, and perhaps more important, is<br/>
that the goblins are spread out wonderfully in nice little sets of twos and<br/>
threes in nice large rooms with room to fight.  Even though it&#39;s a &quot;mine&quot;<br/>
you&#39;re not going to be forced to fight in little collapsed tunnels.  Parts<br/>
of it kinda reminded me of the EC tunnel where the Shady Swashbuckler is.<br/>
Nice and big.  Also the scenery is great.  Water everywhere, suspended and<br/>
collapsed train tracks for ore cars, some moving machinery, etc.  Very cool.<br/>
Tip: Way in the back where the Burynai are there is a &quot;secret&quot; tunnel under<br/>
the water.  This zone does not have a bazillion mobs in it, it&#39;s concievable<br/>
that one group could fight all the way to the back and then to the front<br/>
again basically having killed everying in the zone.  So load up invis, Pixie<br/>
Strike, Chains, etc. and knock yourself out, I&#39;m going to.<br/>

&gt;     Wow!  Can&#39;t say enough good things about the exp mi... err<br/>
&gt; goblin mine &lt;g&gt; in Ill Omen.  Went there on a tip from a<br/>
&gt; guildmate at 29 Friday night, and am now halfway to 31 (and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s with studying for finals, *and* getting a tp to WC to go<br/>
&gt; buy songs in FP, HPH, and Qeynos, then insta-porting back to<br/>
&gt; Kunark via the Qeynos Arena and a helpdul young warrior.<br/>
&gt; heeheehee).  Even though the warlords still give good experience,<br/>
&gt; the other critters are kinda slow :o/<br/>
&gt;     So, any ideas on where I can go next for great solo exp?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ld like to hang around Kunark so I can be here for 32, and<br/>
&gt; weasel my way  (using manasong as leverage :op  ) into one of the<br/>
&gt; Karnor groups getting all the nifty bard items.<br/>
