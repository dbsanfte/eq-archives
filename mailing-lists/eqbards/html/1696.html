<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648504739"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know that this song has been talked about a whole lot...but sadly i<br/>
&gt; missed <br/>
&gt; all of it. All I want to know is how you can take out a whole camp using<br/>
&gt; it? <br/>
&gt; I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs in east <br/>
&gt; commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the song on one<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs followed. Can <br/>
&gt; somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>
&gt; Thanks...<br/>

four orcs, lament three of them and then attack the fourth one.  After you<br/>
attack, back out of the camp so when the lament wears off on the other three<br/>
you will not be in their attack radius.  Once you finish off the first one,<br/>
start the process over again.  You need to /con the creatures first to<br/>
determine which ones are most likely to resist the song.  I usually target<br/>
the lower levels and attack the higher levels.  You can equip your<br/>
lute/mandolin to increase your chances of success.  Be advised that if the<br/>
creature resists the song then he is likely to attack you.  If there are<br/>
other creatures nearby that haven&#39;t been lamented yet then they are likely<br/>
to attack you also.  Need to have the drum handy so you can start up Selo&#39;s<br/>
if you find yourself in that situation.  <br/>
<br/>
	Using the tactic just described, I have been able to draw out 1 or 2<br/>
dervish cutthroats at a time and leave 3-4 of them still standing in their<br/>
camp.  Makes life much easier for your party.  The harder thing to<br/>
accomplish is convince the rest of the party to practice some patience and<br/>
let you do your trick.  Its been my misfortune to sometimes group with<br/>
people who just prefer to engage in a massive frontal assault and take them<br/>
all on at once.    <br/>
