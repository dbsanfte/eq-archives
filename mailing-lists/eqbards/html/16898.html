<div id="ygrps-yiv-66758864">&quot;At any rate, using screech to taunt like that would have caused a massive<br/>
train (lower guk) and probably would have wound up wiping out one, if not<br/>
both, of the other 2 groups in the area.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you evac, the mobs are gonna path back out of your room anyway, so I<br/>
don&#39;t see Screech as being unfriendly as I once thought it was.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In guk on a live server at worst you&#39;re going to get a few folks a little<br/>
inconvenienced.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh, these days, you&#39;re doing them a favor.<br/>
