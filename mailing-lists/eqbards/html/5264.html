<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636840592">I used it to help a Barbarian Shaman friend get past a guard blocking the<br/>
door to the basement of High Keep.  Only time I&#39;ve used it, but glad I had<br/>
it then!<br/>

&gt;besides the point. Fortunately the group member was also a bard so he<br/>
&gt;memorized it and blinked me underneath into the water. I then equipped my<br/>
&gt;flute and blinked out down the passage.<br/>
&gt; Sure we could have used a succor/evac, but we didn&#39;t want to waste the<br/>

&gt;8)The level 14 song DOES have a purpose.  With many lore items,<br/>
&gt;8)and even a few<br/>
&gt;8)non-lore items you receive a message about the item.  For<br/>
&gt;8)instance, one ogre<br/>
&gt;8)I happened upon once mentioned someone had given him a human<br/>
&gt;8)head as a gift,<br/>
&gt;8)and he wished to know whose it was.  With that song I was<br/>
&gt;8)able to tell him<br/>
&gt;8)the name of the disgusting little pet head he carried around<br/>
&gt;8)with him.  The<br/>
&gt;8)song is often useful for getting clues with quest items.  I<br/>
&gt;8)once found a key<br/>
&gt;8)and used the song to tell me it was a High Hold Strongbox<br/>
&gt;8)key.  Many of the<br/>
&gt;8)messages you get from items using this song have not been<br/>
&gt;8)implemented yet<br/>
&gt;8)(that&#39;s what pending lore means!).  Bards get a song to learn the lore<br/>
&gt;8)behind the item, and though the lore might often be<br/>
&gt;8)pointless, of course<br/>
&gt;8)bards should know it!  So the song is good.<br/>
&gt;8)<br/>
&gt;8)Regardless, I use this song more often that Mellifluous<br/>
&gt;8)Motion!  Now THERE&#39;s<br/>
&gt;8)a song I see no purpose for!  It seems to function like the<br/>
&gt;8)old D&D spell<br/>
&gt;8)Blink, but for it to be useful at all I think it would need its pulses<br/>
&gt;8)shortened.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a joke-song, and often a<br/>
&gt;8)cruel joke at that.<br/>
