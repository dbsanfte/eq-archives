&gt;They were easy to get if you started the game at the beginning.   People<br/>

&gt;question yourself - they were easy to get (just go kill someone that has<br/>
&gt;them).  I like the fact that I can spend my money on something and keep it<br/>
&gt;until I want to get rid of it.  Not on a whim of a SnotBoy or KewlDuuude,<br/>

I agree 100%. I&#39;d much rather put up with EQ&#39;s little niggling annoying<br/>
things rather than UO&#39;s PKing and their little niggling annoying things<br/>
(Smile).<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I only played UO for a couple of weeks, then tried EQ. I was sold<br/>
instantly on EQ, and closed my UO account that day. For me, UO was just so<br/>
dang boring.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just me. (smile)<br/>
