<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759123963"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The easiest way to &quot;unstick&quot; your song is to start/stop it several times<br/>
&gt;quickly. This ALWAYS works.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;ve had it happen to me where I couldn&#39;t start or stop a song... it<br/>
just kept refreshing my buttons, but I wasn&#39;t playing anything at all. I hit<br/>
all my spell keys several times to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I used the /stop command, and that cleared things up.<br/>
