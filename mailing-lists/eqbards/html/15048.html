&gt;Help me out here...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you put your int stuff on, your mana bar goes from 5 full bubs to 3 <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;a half bubs and you can get it to fill back in if you wait long enough?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And for other casters: Could there be any benefit of using the Elegy song <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;raise int/wis for &quot;buffers&quot; ?? Does playing the song (increases int & wis)<br/>
&gt;increase the base mana? Which would then help them in those marathon buff<br/>
&gt;sessions pre-dragons, etc.  And can it be stacked with Clarity song?  Does<br/>
&gt;it stack with 2 bards playing it in the same group?  If you stop playing <br/>
&gt;it,<br/>
&gt;does their mana volume decrease?  Ie: could it be used to &quot;mana buff&quot;<br/>
&gt;casters prior to a big battle where they are gonna chain cast till OOM<br/>
&gt;anyhow?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way mana buffs (either +mana items or +stat items) work is that they <br/>
raise your max mana level, not your current mana level.  So to take <br/>
advantage of the &#39;bonus mana&#39; you get you have to med up first.  Elergy will <br/>
raise the max mana of the casters, so they would still need to med to get <br/>
the extra mana.  This is useless during a buff session, as the rate of <br/>
buffing is controlled by mana recovery time, not max mana.<br/>
<br/>
Elergy could be used to give the mana munchers a bit of extra mana at the <br/>
start of a long battle.  You would need to play it and keep it playing till <br/>
they had medded to full then after they have let loose their first blast you <br/>
could stop playing and do what ever else is needed.  As when the int/wis <br/>
buff fades it will only lower their max mana not their current mana level.  <br/>
Given this, is it worth the effort? For most (if not all) Int casters in the <br/>
mid to high 40&#39;s the answer is no.  As they can fairly easily get to 200+ <br/>
int by then.  Most wis casters are usually at 200+ wis as well, except for <br/>
Shaman (esp Troll and Orge shaman).  Since they start with a much lower base <br/>
wisdom.<br/>
