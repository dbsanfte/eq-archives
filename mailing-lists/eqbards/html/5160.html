<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015911255">Roop, I feel for you.  Truly I do.  Last night, for a change of pace, I<br/>
decided I&#39;d play my Gnome Enchanter and make some coin.  I logged in,<br/>
discovered I was right next Butcherblock entrance of Greater Faydark.  And<br/>
there were people hollering for binds.  Oh joy!  So I ran as fast as my<br/>
stubby little legs would carry me, only to discover they&#39;d already gotten<br/>
binds.  No biggy.  I set up camp, medded in preparation, memorized the<br/>
necessary spells only to have someone plop down next to me and shout &quot;Free<br/>
binds, next 5 minutes!&quot; *mutter* okay, so I waited.  5 minutes later, he<br/>
left, and I auctioned &quot;Binding for donations in Kelethin area&quot; (figuring, I<br/>
could get to either &quot;major&quot; bind point in a brief period.)  for the next 2<br/>
hours I auctioned.  Not one taker.<br/>
Some days I should just stay in bed.<br/>
<br/>
But the point was not how depressing that was.  The point is that tonight,<br/>
I&#39;m going back, gonna play someone else or somewhere else, and I will have<br/>
fun.  And if not, well, EQ can sleep while I do other things.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, While I was there some guy auctioned 2 Combine Long Swords for 15<br/>
plat. ACK! I asked him twice but apparently he&#39;d already been besieged :P<br/>
Oh well.)<br/>
