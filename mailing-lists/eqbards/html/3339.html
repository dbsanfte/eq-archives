Ged and Luna(?), so I didn&#39;t get a chance to follow them and<br/>
note their wandering habits.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ghouls that stand upright (spotted one night).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen it several times.  Always by the lake where the<br/>
skeletons form in piles, and zombies and mummies sit down.<br/>
I will try charming a ghoul soon (one bubble til 27) and<br/>
commanding it to sit down and see what it looks like.<br/>
<br/>
The lake is also something I&#39;ve been meaning to explore a<br/>
little better.  The water is murky so it&#39;s easy to miss<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One minute Ged is standing there happily, the next moment,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, neat.  I&#39;ll have to try asking Kithicor about a few<br/>
things in the hopes I can stumble across a keyword.  The<br/>
biggest frustration in tracking down these folks in Kithicor<br/>
is that I cannot track.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One night I saw Luna?? run into a burned out house and a<br/>
&gt; female zombie run out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I ran into Ged again a few hours later, and he was alone.<br/>
I found Luna some distance away.  I figured they walked<br/>
different routes and the first time I just happened to catch<br/>
them at the same place at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And why doesn&#39;t she speak?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of NPCs don&#39;t speak - Rivervale is full of them.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, figuring it was as yet<br/>
unimplemented.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *one* goblin? How often do you see a lone goblin? Not<br/>
&gt; named, just a regular ol&#39; goblin. Is he lost?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pretty frequently actually.  Each undead camp seems to have<br/>
several individual spawn &quot;spots.&quot;  Each &quot;spot&quot; can spawn<br/>
anywhere from 1 to 7 (most I&#39;ve seen) undead, always of the<br/>
same type.  The druid stones in North Ro operate the same way,<br/>
though you may be right - I don&#39;t recall ever seeing ghouls<br/>
spawn there in anything but groups of two.<br/>
<br/>
There are wisps in Kithicor too - very rare but occasionally<br/>
you will see them.  The place actually reminds me a lot of<br/>
Lesser Faydark, but with a lot more fog.  LFay also has orc<br/>
and undead camps, and a ranger(?) outpost, as well as the<br/>
faerie and brownie villages.  It is also a zone well worth<br/>
exploring from L8 on up if you are into avoiding crowds.<br/>
