&gt; &gt; I wonder if the GM/Guide bards have a percussion<br/>
&gt; &gt; instrument that is above, and beyond, the Drum of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s March and/or Mistmoore Battledrum.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; should have offered to trade :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From a reliable source.. Guides do not get *any* of their<br/>
&gt; class&#39;s spells or songs. They also do not get any<br/>
&gt; instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>
&gt; to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>
&gt; another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>
&gt; saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:toren@...">toren@...</a><br/>
&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>
