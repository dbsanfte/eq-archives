<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-465436188">Found one in Steamfont too, fighting pumas and rats with my druid, on the <br/>
left of the mills (when coming from Ak&#39;Anon, Mino caves straight). When <br/>
things started running or were feared they used to warp close to the mills. <br/>
Once I found it I just ran to the warp point and continue the fight over <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; rathe mountains is and always has been bad for warpers, there&#39;s a spot <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we hunt hg&#39;s at and if the monsters get to a certain little bump in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; terrain, get ready for trains of em to come back at ya... anything that <br/>
&gt;goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; over this pathing location will warp away and take a long time to come <br/>
&gt;back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is close to the hill giant hill with the 2 guards on the top. Hg&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; &gt; giant skels, lizards, cycs, basilisks, anything that goes here warps. <br/>
&gt;Sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; i dont have the loc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oasis has a very bad warp spot as well, right by the water just south of <br/>
&gt;&quot;pillar one&quot;.  You only<br/>
&gt;notice it with things that are running away, like orc warriors or things <br/>
&gt;that have been feared. </span></blockquote></div>
