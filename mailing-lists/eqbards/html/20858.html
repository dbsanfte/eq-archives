<div id="ygrps-yiv-514826863">I was in a 4 bard group once.  It was interesting and not ineffective.  We<br/>
did about as well as the other two groups at the giant castle.  We had zero<br/>
down time that&#39;s for sure.  IIRC, I was playing Chains, Psalm of Warmth,<br/>
Warsong, and Pixie Strike (for the MR debuff); another bard was doing<br/>
Chords, Denon&#39;s, and Hymn while instrument swapping; a third was doing Chant<br/>
of Battle, Fulfill&#39;s, and Guardian Rthymns, all with drum; the 4th Bard was<br/>
also doing Warsong, Pixie Strike, and I think Jig.<br/>

I would imagine that they have a very close alliance with the all-necro<br/>
guild and the all-clerics-who-do-resses guild. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, 2 bards in one hunting - not ressing - party was a waste<br/>
of a slot. And 3 bards in a hunting party meant certain death. With 4 bards,<br/>
I would simply /shudder but have never had that experience.<br/>
<br/>
Class diversity provides synergy.  The whole can be greater than the sum of<br/>
the parts. Having 2 of any class in a group has problems and that includes 2<br/>
warriors, imho. Maybe not a problem for the bard but certainly a problem for<br/>
the cleric.  I know that some ppl do dragon and god groups with 2 war, 2<br/>
clr, 1 bard and someone to take the HT/DT but for your daily grind - two of<br/>
anything can be less than desirable.<br/>

p.s. there is an all bard guild on Innoruuk: Miraculous Muscians.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. &quot;I would not want to join any club that would have me for a member.&quot;<br/>
(was that W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx?)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So, there is now an all-bard guild on Povar, the Songweavers of Povar&quot; I<br/>
&gt; think. I have been asked twice if I was interested, and while I usually<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; it a point to not join any guild who would ask me to join cold, I am<br/>
curious<br/>
&gt; about them. Anyone ever run across them? Are they on other servers? I am<br/>
&gt; VERY curious what guild hunts look like :)<br/>
