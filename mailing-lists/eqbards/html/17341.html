<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099625875">Was just looking through the song site, and didn&#39;t notice an AC component to<br/>
Celerity.<br/>
<br/>
Does Celerity have an AC component, or is the AC increase strictly due to<br/>
the +AGI?<br/>
<br/>
I was with a monk, and Celerity increased her AC by I think 12, but I&#39;m not<br/>
sure what her original AGI was, I&#39;ll ask tonight<br/>
