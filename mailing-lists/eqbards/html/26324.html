Before you start burning up the Internet looking for gaming jobs, you may want to remember one thing, that game testing is a job. A job; where your assignment is to find any defects or bugs in the game, where you may spend hours testing the same level over and over again. But if you enjoy the challenge of playing a video game from start to finish, this probably won&#39;t be a problem for you.<br/>

But, before you become a game tester, there are a few things that you may want to know:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These companies are looking for people, who are avid gamers, people that have an eye for detail. <br/>
People that can submit a report on their findings, in a timely manner, and using correct grammar and spelling. <br/>
People that have experience playing different types of games on different consoles. (Now that doesn&#39;t mean that you couldn&#39;t get a job if all your experience is on an Xbox.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, most people imagine that being a game tester means spending all day playing the latest and greatest game titles. And to some extent this is true, but what you have to remember is this is a real job (with benefits), remember to take it seriously. So, when submitting your resume to become a game tester, be professional, and point out your gaming experience.<br/>
