<div id="ygrps-yiv-601124922">Thanks. At least somebody else notice that too. Also, stick to the full<br/>
screen mode,<br/>
I really noticed shorter &quot;grey time&quot; for my song buttons.<br/>

When you stop a song, you have to wait for the button to<br/>
&quot;ungrey.&quot;  The speed of that animation depends entire on the<br/>
frames per second you&#39;re getting.  If you&#39;re on a slow system<br/>
or lagged due to spell animations, it&#39;s going to take longer.<br/>
On my original K6-200 system, it was impossible to play more<br/>
than 2 songs at a time because the buttons took over a half<br/>
second to ungrey.  Right now on my 550 MHz system, I play in<br/>
D3D mode, even though glide mode produces cleaner output with<br/>
less jerkiness.  The D3D mode has a higher fps, and the slight<br/>
difference is very noticeable when I start pounding at the<br/>
song buttons.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably my biggest gripe about the interface.  It<br/>
makes sense when applied to spellcasting (the spells usually<br/>
remained greyed for several seconds after casting, so an<br/>
extra quarter second doesn&#39;t really matter), but is really<br/>
stupid when applied to our songs.<br/>
