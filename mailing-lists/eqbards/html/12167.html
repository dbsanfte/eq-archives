<div id="ygrps-yiv-184141371">[STR or Dex]<br/>
<br/>
                            I give up, which one determines how often<br/>
you hit?<br/>
<br/>
                            Neither. Only your level, offense, and<br/>
weapons skill<br/>
                            figures into the chance to hit.<br/>
<br/>
                            STR determines max damage and average<br/>
damage.<br/>
                            Higher STR will raise your damage cap, and<br/>
will also<br/>
                            increase your likelihood of hitting closer<br/>
to your max.<br/>
                            The exception to this is Archery, where Dex<br/>
determines<br/>
                            this.<br/>
<br/>
                            Dex determines how often a weapon will fire<br/>
a random<br/>
                            process, and also figures into critical hits<br/>
for warriors. It<br/>
                            also figures into some of the rogue skills.<br/>

This was on EQVault. At one time I had 116 STR and 151 DEX and I still<br/>
missed alot. Dex didn&#39;t seem to improve my hitting ability at all. So<br/>
eventually I scrapped DEX altogether since I felt it was useless to a<br/>
bard, despite being a &quot;primary&quot; stat. I feel cheated to have given my<br/>
bard a starting dex of 90 but oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Now DEX does add mana for a bard though right? I suppose this is true,<br/>
but I hardly get a chance to use dirge in the first place, seeing as how<br/>
whenever I get res&#39;d, all my mana zips to 0 and before I can regain 4<br/>
bars of it, I&#39;m dead/getting res&#39;d again. And yea, hunting in the planes<br/>
at 50, I die too often. Also, another thing about bard mana... I got<br/>
super drunk which dropped my int to 15, then sobered back up to where my<br/>
int was back to normal and I was missing a full bubble of mana. So int<br/>
definitely plays a part in our mana amount, but I have yet to confirm<br/>
dex or cha for doing so. I&#39;ll have to test that out.<br/>
So I&#39;d suggest you sacrifice dex for STR, unless you have a Proc&#39;ing<br/>
weapon in which it&#39;d be good to have some dex without totally killing<br/>
strength.<br/>
