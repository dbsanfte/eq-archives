<div id="ygrps-yiv-524957504">I can see where Sartori is coming from, and while you may have taken offense<br/>
to his response, you shouldn&#39;t have.  I&#39;m guessing here, but I think Sartori<br/>
comes from a day when if you wanted to do fear, you had to break it, and<br/>
there were very likely very few groups that were capable of it.  The people<br/>
that piss him off (I&#39;m guessing) are those that wait lurking outside the<br/>
gates for hours on end, hoping for the break-in group to leave so they can<br/>
come in and pharm repops at absolutely no risk.<br/>
I don&#39;t know that he meant to imply that you&#39;re one of these people, but<br/>
these people do exist.  They don&#39;t give a damn about breaking a plane, or<br/>
actually accomplishing anything, so long as they are somehow able to acquire<br/>
their phat l3wt.  These people don&#39;t care for a challenge, but only for the<br/>
rewards.  It is perhaps difficult to spend countless hours and deaths on<br/>
planar breaks, only to see some farmer who put in no effort wearing more<br/>
planar gear than you.<br/>
Sadly, these type of people make up a large part of the gaming population,<br/>
but to imply that those were your reasons for going to fear were probably a<br/>
mistake.<br/>
I think its just an easy generalization to make, having been on the inside,<br/>
and having experienced the vultures in waiting.<br/>

Sartori - I just turned 48, and I&#39;m in a small guild.  But again - I just<br/>
turned 48 - never been on a Plane or Dragon raid.  I know nothing of Plane<br/>
Raids: Fear, Hate, Air, Breaks or Respawns except for whets been posted on<br/>
this list - and the Backstage Forum.  And let&#39;s face it - there hasn&#39;t been<br/>
much discussion of it.<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea WHAT to expect.  I was there to learn.  I don&#39;t recall any<br/>
discussion here of how respawns work in Fear and what to expect. No one<br/>
promised me any treasure - no one called it farming.  I was simply asked if<br/>
I wanted to &quot;join a raid on fear&quot;.  I posted my experience and asked a<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to participate in Breaking Fear.  It occurred at 7:30 AM my<br/>
time while I was sound asleep (I am a professional musician and was working<br/>
until 12:30 the night before - had dinner with the guys in the band - got<br/>
home at 3:30).  As soon as someone invites me to break fear - I&#39;m in.  It&#39;s<br/>
not like I can organize one myself having participated once in a respawn and<br/>
never been on a break...<br/>
<br/>
I posted what I posted to find out if this was typical; to find out what<br/>
items do in fact drop there and to ask how the respawn works.  I posted this<br/>
for all the other Bards who&#39;ve never been invited on a Fear Raid to know my<br/>
experience AND HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT! (I sure didn&#39;t).  No one said<br/>
they were farming treasure - no one promised me anything.  The only thing<br/>
was a general belief that things start to respawn in numbers after a good<br/>
12-14 hours.  They organized 4 full groups expecting to need them all.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the information you posted, but I found your post to be<br/>
patronizing, sarcastic and even insulting.  It seems to me that over the<br/>
time, this board has been declining in tone.  I worry that we are getting to<br/>
the point where people are going to be afraid to post something without<br/>
being jumped on.  It&#39;s not surprising the number of people who have quietly<br/>
disappeared from here and stopped posting.  It shouldn&#39;t be a crime to be<br/>
wrong; and even worse - to have an opinion - and my God - asking a question?<br/>

How does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect to be bored<br/>
off his ass? The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting is<br/>
if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would<br/>
only do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>
<br/>
As the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate,<br/>
unless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and<br/>
instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a challenge<br/>
*gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you<br/>
will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours,<br/>
depending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a<br/>
lot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount<br/>
of time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the<br/>
first hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane<br/>
opening.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the<br/>
most fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak.<br/>
Kiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>
<br/>
People farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if<br/>
this offends any of you, oh well):<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in<br/>
[Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>
Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me [a shovel]<br/>
and [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a [reward]!<br/>
Kruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat lewtz] with<br/>
no risk other then [/random 100].<br/>
