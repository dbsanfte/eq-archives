useless quest).<br/>
On another note, Min, I am a slacker but if you still need that bp we can do<br/>
it this weekend... <br/>
We killed Trak again though last night tee hee - no bard bp yet (had to make<br/>
this related!) but got a cobalt and a druid :)<br/>
Going to try our luck on the DL dragon i think this weekend :)<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] a few kaesora questions<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; anyone know where the strathbone shell shield in kaesora <br/>
&gt; drops, i have a<br/>
&gt; couple friends that would love to get their hands on it, im <br/>
&gt; assuming the<br/>
&gt; spiders but dunno.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was in there last night trying to get the stupid fang, took <br/>
&gt; us 2 hours to<br/>
&gt; get to the rest of the gang down there waiting for him to <br/>
&gt; spawn (they were<br/>
&gt; down there 6 hours and got 3 fangs only) and we were there a <br/>
&gt; couple hours<br/>
&gt; and only 1 spawned.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the bright side, got some truesilver boots (AC11)from a <br/>
&gt; ravener for my<br/>
&gt; bard (he&#39;s only got steel booties on) and we all got a <br/>
&gt; ransackers pack (25%<br/>
&gt; weight reduction) from spectral guardians.  We got lost big <br/>
&gt; time in there,<br/>
&gt; its a very cool layout for a dungeon and was fun running <br/>
&gt; around lost in it,<br/>
&gt; seems very big, we killed a librarian and got a tome (6int 6 wis) and<br/>
&gt; basically ran around killing everything in sight. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But anyways, thats not the main reason i writing this email, my main<br/>
&gt; question is where do i go to get the coin (and whats it from) from the<br/>
&gt; xolvarg or wahtever he&#39;s called  and also, what the hell is a Spectral<br/>
&gt; Pestle for from the spectral guardians.... they&#39;re no drop <br/>
&gt; and alakazams has<br/>
&gt; no info on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One last question, anything else i should pick up while im there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Minkin 37 bard<br/>
&gt; -Rakka 52 necro  &lt;-- he&#39;s camping the place as its easier for <br/>
&gt; him then the<br/>
&gt; bard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. I love that cattana song, the bard i was with yesterday <br/>
&gt; kept me and the<br/>
&gt; wizard full mana and i was nuking like a maniac, especially <br/>
&gt; that it stacks<br/>
&gt; with lich form<br/>
&gt; <br/>
