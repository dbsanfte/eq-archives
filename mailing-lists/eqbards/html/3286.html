&gt; What I want to know is WHY can&#39;t someone bind me anywhere THEY can be bound?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, I don&#39;t mind so much not being able to bind MYSELF - but if that<br/>
&gt; magic user can bind HIMSELF there, why can&#39;t he bind me?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a different take on this.  I rather like that some<br/>
zones are &quot;remote&quot; and thus few people go to visit because of<br/>
the potentially long downtime if they get killed.  Instead of<br/>
melee classes being allowed to bind anywhere, I think pure<br/>
casting classes should only be allowed to be bound in cities,<br/>
like melee classes.  :-)<br/>
