<div id="ygrps-yiv-783391577">I think what you&#39;re sayig does ring awfully true. Still, having played a<br/>
necro and a shaman, I can tell you that casters go through the same thing.<br/>
There are spells one should skip, and imagine the frustration of getting<br/>
nothing new until you level 4 more times.<br/>
<br/>
The idea, I guess, is to give bards something to look forward to each level,<br/>
your complaint, which I share, is that there are some things that are<br/>
complete wastes unless you use them in specfic situations. Jig, for example,<br/>
helped me once when I died in Innothule Swamp and was bound to Rivervale. I<br/>
had nothing in the bank (BAD Bard!) and had to run, foodless, drumless<br/>
across the Ro desert. About halfway across Oasis, I was at 0 stamina. This<br/>
is dangerous because even with the running song sans drum, I rely on jumping<br/>
to scoot me away from an attacker. I sat down a memorized Jig (it took a<br/>
while as i had NEVER memorized it before) and managed to get my stamina back<br/>
up enough to safely cross the desert.<br/>

I have noticed something that rather bothers me.  I am currently a level<br/>
11 bard hanging out around the Freeport area.  This is my 3rd character<br/>
since the commercial release, and also the highest level I have reached.<br/>
Previously I have played a Wizard and a Shadow Knight.  I abandoned both<br/>
at 5th level because they are too &quot;high level&quot;.  By this I mean that they<br/>
achieve their greatest &quot;power&quot; at higher levels.  A wizard with no pet is<br/>
not even a match for a magician of similar level until somewhere in the<br/>
teens, root notwithstanding.  The SK was a nice choice, but not even close<br/>
to a warrior&#39;s skill, and with only minor spells until the mid-teens as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Bards, however, struck me as powerful from the beginning.  It seemed like<br/>
my ability to mow through things whether alone or in a party would<br/>
dramatically increase with each new song.  Up until 6th level, each new<br/>
song was fantastic, with the exception of the Jig of Vigor.<br/>
<br/>
However, now it seems the good songs and skills are few and far between.<br/>
The Whistling Warsong was an OK buff, but since it was only personal I<br/>
used it rarely.  At 8th, it was hardly worth the boat ride to get the<br/>
Lullaby, and Elemental Rhythms at level 9 was rather pointless.  Then the<br/>
magic 10 hit, and I learned Dodge and the awesome Anthem de Arms.  AT 11,<br/>
though, I get the USELESS brass skill and the buggy or just plain weak<br/>
Charisma booster.  Not exactly songs to light my fire.  12th, or course,<br/>
yields the Bellow, a much sought after song.  Then I have to look forward<br/>
to another &quot;don&#39;t memorize me, ever&quot; song or two, another Rhythm and the<br/>
Magic Identifier (absolutely useless).  Honstly, the only 2 things I<br/>
really look forward to at all in the near future are the Sleep Song at 15,<br/>
Dual Wield at 17th, and the group invisibility song at 19th, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed these &quot;bum&quot; levels, like 9th, 11th, and I am sure<br/>
others to come?  Are hih level bards even worth it?  I hate seeing posts<br/>
like &quot;I am 19th level and I still use Anthem de Arms and Hymn of<br/>
Restoration almost exclusively&quot;.  It will be a long and boring wait until<br/>
the better abilities come, I am afraid.<br/>
<br/>
What say you high level bards?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?<br/>
