<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229280359">There&#39;s a lot of positive changes in this patch.  I&#39;ll leave you to read the<br/>
notable Bard changes.  The increased customisation of the client gui is<br/>
welcome, too.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s hope it all works as intended. ;)<br/>

***Patch Day***<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included<br/>
with DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play<br/>
EverQuest. Please refer to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> prior to contacting<br/>
technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch also includes the new &quot;Sound Engine&quot; that we&#39;ve been speaking<br/>
about for some time. The new sound engine supports additional EAX features<br/>
and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the<br/>
past.<br/>
<br/>
*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br/>
<br/>
The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday<br/>
11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight. All players wishing<br/>
to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those<br/>
servers to the new split-server should execute &quot;/movelog yes&quot; during the<br/>
windows.<br/>
<br/>
The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or<br/>
Wednesday. Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for<br/>
a firm time when it is decided. Remember that corpses will not follow you to<br/>
the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all<br/>
corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.<br/>
<br/>
As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people<br/>
being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention<br/>
after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during<br/>
the window. You will need to be present and execute the command in order to<br/>
move.<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br/>
-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing<br/>
the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br/>
-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was<br/>
checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br/>
-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br/>
-- Fixed the &quot;Modulating Rod&quot; so that it can be used by the appropriate<br/>
races.<br/>
-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br/>
-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength<br/>
spell.<br/>
-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack<br/>
appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br/>
<br/>
-- Modified the &quot;Jonathan&#39;s&quot; line of songs to remove the &quot;skin&quot; effect in<br/>
order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat. In addition, we<br/>
made them &quot;Self Only&quot; spells rather than &quot;Single Target&quot; spells in order to<br/>
allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br/>
<br/>
*General Fixes/Changes*<br/>
<br/>
-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on &quot;Sister&#39;s Isle&quot; to attack people who<br/>
were fighting pirates.<br/>
-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game<br/>
since they do not have the piercing skill.<br/>
-- The &quot;Belt of the River&quot; quest should now work correctly.<br/>
-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br/>
-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br/>
-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items to see<br/>
your changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br/>
-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the<br/>
correct loot.<br/>
-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br/>
-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br/>
-- Made the &quot;Gravebinder&quot; a magic weapon.<br/>
<br/>
-- Repaired the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when<br/>
placing items in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction<br/>
component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br/>
<br/>
-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures<br/>
above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, most<br/>
creatures below the character&#39;s level can now be successfully taunted. As a<br/>
note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that<br/>
of a creature below 50th.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Client Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br/>
-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total<br/>
number of available socials by 108.<br/>
-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate<br/>
incorrectly.<br/>
-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at<br/>
higher resolutions.<br/>
-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br/>
<br/>
-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider. Users should now<br/>
see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an<br/>
adjustable clipping plane.<br/>
<br/>
-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show &quot;[LD]&quot; over their heads when<br/>
linkdead. In addition, these same players will no longer show as &quot;LinkDead&quot;<br/>
in the /who list.<br/>
<br/>
-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: Usage<br/>
&quot;/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B&quot; where &quot;UserColorNumber is the number of<br/>
the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red,<br/>
green and blue respectively. All changes will be automatically saved to your<br/>
EQCLIENT.INI file.<br/>
<br/>
-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the<br/>
character name indicating the server number. As such, you will now be able<br/>
to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different<br/>
custom options.<br/>
<br/>
-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and<br/>
character name. For instance, if your character is named &quot;Bobb&quot;, and you are<br/>
on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br/>
<br/>
-- Added two new entries to the &quot;Defaults&quot; section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:<br/>
AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on<br/>
automatically when assisting. Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;.<br/>
ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the &quot;Soandso is<br/>
inspecting you&quot; message. Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two keys,<br/>
a primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In addition, things<br/>
that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your<br/>
preference. Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key,<br/>
right-click to set the secondary.<br/>
<br/>
-- Added the /note command. /note will append the following text to a file<br/>
called &quot;notes.txt&quot; in your EverQuest directory. For instance, typing &quot;/note<br/>
This is a note&quot; will put &quot;This is a note&quot; on the next line in the notes.txt<br/>
file.<br/>
