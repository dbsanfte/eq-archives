<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507166391">Well met fellow travlers, I seek only to introduce my self to thoes that<br/>
come to this place to converse and share in their experances. I am a<br/>
Half-Elf Bard of 5th level in the town of Freeport.  My name is SnowLynx,<br/>
and while still young in my travles I seek to learn much of the world of<br/>
Norrath. I have seen much of the city of Freeport and the east commons, I<br/>
would admit my visit to the sewers of Freeport was not the most glamourous<br/>
of adventures, but it was intresting. I seek others of my traid to share<br/>
experances and information that I/they have gathered while exploring the<br/>
realm.<br/>
<br/>
    In hopes of hearring from you soon...<br/>
<br/>
    SnowLynx, Gentelman Bard of Freeport...</div>
