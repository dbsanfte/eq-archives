<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168457697">Also to add, if I made mistakes at work this regularly, not only would<br/>
everyone go over everything I did with a fine toothed comb, but I&#39;d have<br/>
been unemployed by now if I continually told them &quot;but I tested that&quot; when<br/>
it eas so obvious I didn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; I couldn&#39;t imagine being in a job where EVERY thing I did was questioned,<br/>
&gt; analyzed, reanalyzed, condemned and 2nd guessed at least 140,000 times.<br/>
&gt; Where you do something you see as positive and a section of people will<br/>
&gt; always think it sucks.  How many changes went into the patch?  1 or 2<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; they missed for whatever reason doesn&#39;t account for much.  Especially when<br/>
&gt; they WILL be fixed sooner rather than later.  Shit does happen and I&#39;m<br/>
glad<br/>
&gt; someone (or 170,000 someone&#39;s) isn&#39;t there nitpicking at every move I<br/>
make.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine doing a job, screwing up not once but a couple of times,<br/>
and then not being particularly careful to make sure I don&#39;t screw up at<br/>
least that one area again the next time I do something. I mean, this has<br/>
happened to bards consistantly now for 6 months. Wouldn&#39;t most people<br/>
make extra sure they checked that area of things carefully after having<br/>
let out the first couple of errors? Personally, I don&#39;t like looking<br/>
like an idiot in public and that to me is what these repeated mistakes<br/>
make them look like.<br/>
