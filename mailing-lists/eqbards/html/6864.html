&gt; Wasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>
&gt; different armor types provided different protection, independent of the<br/>
&gt; AC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>
&gt; friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I need some clarification on this one!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a bunch of bronze armor stacked up in the bank that I haven&#39;t been<br/>
wearing because the items that it replaces have magical bonuses (barbed<br/>
leggings and barbed arms for a +2 to DEX and to AGI), Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>
etc.  The weight increase vs. the minimal AC increase has kept me in a mix of<br/>
magic/banded.<br/>
<br/>
Am I to understand that putting on a bunch of bronze for an AC increase of<br/>
around 8 or 10 pts is going to make a big big difference in mob damage?<br/>
