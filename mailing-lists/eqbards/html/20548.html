<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755796377">Good mages are great, they do more damage than wizards.<br/>
<br/>
Their pets and damage shield more than make up the difference between their<br/>
blasts and a wiz&#39;s blast.  Also mages are much less mana dependent for<br/>
damage so they often need to med less.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend might be a great paladin (more than might, I will grant you she<br/>
is).  However if you are hearing those not a legal target messages and she<br/>
blows up corpses, she does not know how to play her mage.<br/>
<br/>
While bards and mages dont mix all that well (our songs dont help their<br/>
pets, we dont need their summoned bandages and our charm spells can<br/>
sometimes play havok with pets), mages are not a weak class at all.  Perhaps<br/>
people dont have good experiences with them very often since mages often<br/>
solo most of their careers, thus have bad group skills and bad dungeon<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
When I gave up my troll warrior, I switched to a mage and always played in<br/>
groups (mostly in dungeons like Old Paw and Guk).  People were amazed how<br/>
much damage a mage could bring to the group without saying &quot;OOM&quot; the whole<br/>
time.  Also back in that day (pre people having 3 lvl 50 characters to twink<br/>
with) every tank would bow down before you when you gave them a stack of<br/>
bandages for free.  I never had my pet cause a train that killed us.  (On<br/>
the occasion my pet would be naughty, I would say &quot;ETS&quot; to the group and<br/>
gate out).<br/>
<br/>
In short (TOO LATE!), mages much like most classes are viable if played well<br/>
and seemingly a horrid class if played badly.</div>
