<div id="ygrps-yiv-511702228"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Nobody explicitly said this, but if I&#39;m not mistaken, Ultravision <br/>
&gt; also allows you to see through invisibility.  I used to sing it to find <br/>
&gt; out whether any of my favorite KSing Wizards were hiding in the rooms <br/>
&gt; with us in High Keep.  I am pretty certain that infravision does not see <br/>
&gt; invisible, since I believe it is the same as my native Half-Elf <br/>
&gt; infravision.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s a nice additional effect of our song.  Normal ultravision<br/>
  does not allow you to see invis, however.  Concord is dual <br/>
  effect in nature, see invis + ultravision. <br/>
