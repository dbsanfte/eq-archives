<div id="ygrps-yiv-254717386">Let me add a condition on to what I said.  If you are in a group that consists<br/>
primarily of low 30s folks, then you should probably stay out in front of the<br/>
castle.  Everything will be blue or higher to you.  If you are in a group that<br/>
is primarily 35+ people in it, then camping in the tunnel is better.  Hillock<br/>
giants never spawn in the tunnel.  Most of the hillocks con green to anyone 35+<br/>
so they end up being a waste of mana for groups camping in front of the<br/>
fortress.<br/>

The tunnel is actually the best place to set up camp if you are hunting the<br/>
giants in FM.  The only hard part about it is convincing your group to move<br/>
down in there.  It isn&#39;t that hard to do once you have done it a couple of<br/>
times.  First thing you need to do is set up camp outside the gates and pull<br/>
all the giants on the right side of the fortress.  Once that is done, med up<br/>
and have every one move in towards the entrance of the tunnel.  There will<br/>
likely be some giants nearby but their aggro range is so small that they<br/>
will not attack you.  Your group will need to be ready to fight two giants<br/>
near the tunnel entrance.  For this fight, you need to kill them quickly and<br/>
make sure there are no runners.  Once you kill these two, move into the<br/>
first part of the tunnel and med up.  There will be one or two giants a<br/>
short distance from the tunnel entrance.  These may start roaming if they<br/>
have been there for a while so be ready to get attacked.  Kill those, med up<br/>
and then kill the giants further down the tunnel.  Once you kill those, you<br/>
should be able to move down to the bottom of the ramp.<br/>
<br/>
Several reasons why camping at the bottom of the tunnel is best.  First off,<br/>
you don&#39;t have to worry about any wandering mobs.  They will not come down<br/>
to the level portion of the tunnel.  Second reason is that you can safely<br/>
use the chains/fear trick here.  Third reason is that mountain crags spawn<br/>
in the tunnel.  The crags are higher level (some conned yellow to me at 35th<br/>
level) than the giants who spawn outside in the fortress.    <br/>
<br/>
Getting out of the fortress can be tricky.  Most likely you will have to<br/>
make a mad dash but with Selos the bard is relatively safe.  In the times I<br/>
have camped the tunnel, the casters gated out and the meleers followed me.<br/>
We aggroed a few giants on our way to the LOIO zone but after a while they<br/>
stopped chasing us.  You could try Lamenting the mobs if you want to as<br/>
well.<br/>

Out of curiosity, has anyone ever been into the tunnel in the Giant Castle<br/>
in FM?  We had 4 groups pulling giants outside the castle last night and we<br/>
still couldn&#39;t clear the inside to allow one to get to the tunnel.<br/>
