12/54.  :)<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is that if you parse your log files and find<br/>
that weapon A does 1.1x as much damage/time as weapon B when<br/>
wielded in your primary, then weapon A also does 1.1x as much<br/>
damage/time as weapon B when wielded in your secondary.  The<br/>
speeds of the weapons are irrelevant.  If one weapon is better<br/>
than another in your primary hand, then it is also better in<br/>
your secondary hand.  Yes the faster weapon gets more dual<br/>
wield checks, but this is exactly canceled out by the lower<br/>
damage of the faster weapon.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have a 6/23 weapon and a 12/45 weapon, and after<br/>
comparing both in your primary hand you find the 12/45 weapon<br/>
does 1.1x as much damage as the 6/23 weapon, then the 12/45<br/>
weapon is better, whether in the primary or secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure you check with a logfile parser first though.  There<br/>
are nonlinearities in the combat system which make is so a<br/>
6/23 weapon is not equal to a 12/46 weapon despite the ratios<br/>
being the same.<br/>
