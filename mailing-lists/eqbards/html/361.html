<div id="ygrps-yiv-457198592">Yes, I too used a dagger and parrying dagger for the longest time, just has<br/>
a -great- look.  Actually the weapon I preferred: a Giant Snake Fang.  O<br/>
loved that fang, nice for lv 8.  The advantage, of course, is speed.  I<br/>
believed, when I took up piercing, that the speed advantage may actually<br/>
even-out the damage disadvantage.  One can procure a snake fang in the<br/>
Qeynos area cheapest (believe I paid 5 gold, but some say folks there<br/>
actually give them away), for fangs come off beasts from that BB dungeon one<br/>
takes to reach Halas.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have Anthem de Arms and Whistling Warsong, I just may set my<br/>
Minotaur Axe aside for a bit and grab that dusty fang from the bank.  Always<br/>
good to keep piercing high anyway, but perhaps with the speed bonuses of<br/>
these songs, my fang will be even more effective?<br/>
<br/>
On another note (pun intended), I noticed Lament seems to function better.<br/>
For a while it was great, then there was a patch, and at that time I noticed<br/>
I could now actually lament myself, definitely meaning a tweak to the song.<br/>
At that time, I was dismayed to see how quickly the effects wore off!  But<br/>
now, just this morning, I tried it again on myself and the effects lasted<br/>
much longer (even longer with my mandolin).  It also worked rather well on<br/>
an orc camp loaded with Blue Cons.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, but for a week there<br/>
Lament just caused things to attack me, but now I seem to find it useful<br/>
again.  (Still not going to try lamenting a sand giant though!)<br/>
