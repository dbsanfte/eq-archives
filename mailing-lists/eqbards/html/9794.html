<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080334820">I have a level 29 druid and she gets all sorts of weird foods (gets so<br/>
many that she has to sell them since they take up so many different<br/>
slots) and has been getting them ever since the patch.  It took her<br/>
awhile though and definately for awhile I did not get them (i.e.<br/>
everyone shouting yahoo! I got a shroom and i had never gotten 1 at<br/>
all)  now with my forage well over the master level I get them all the<br/>
time.  I would say that its about in the 130&#39;s or so...i don&#39;t know<br/>
specifically but I get them all the time now along with the usual<br/>
foraged items.  If you are not getting them as a bard I would say that<br/>
you may not get them.  My bard has yet to get anything weird adn she is<br/>
wood elf..My suggestion is to yell out in the zone for them if you want<br/>
special foods...us rangers and druids end up getting rid of them as<br/>
there is just too wide a variety and we usually have an over abundance<br/>
of food.  The other thought i have to add here is that like tracking<br/>
for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a level and it never<br/>
advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is the skill we get it<br/>
at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its at skill lvl 40 when<br/>
we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill cap for druids is 200<br/>
i believe<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe there is a skill-check involved in foraging the new special<br/>
&gt; food<br/>
&gt; (like crocodile eggs, mushrooms, sea salt, sylvian berries, glowing<br/>
&gt; lich,<br/>
&gt; etc), but I&#39;m trying to figure out what it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I have a few questions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>
&gt; 2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>
&gt; 3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than<br/>
&gt; berries,<br/>
&gt; fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; you get it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his<br/>
&gt; skill cap<br/>
&gt; and has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
