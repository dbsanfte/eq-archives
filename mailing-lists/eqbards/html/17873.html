<div id="ygrps-yiv-53388479">get a new guild<br/>
<br/>
find out up front what the loot rules are - before you join<br/>
<br/>
tbh, bards at high levels dont need haste items.  on really big stuff, you<br/>
do not want to be a melee person.  you will contribute best to your team<br/>
with your songs enhanced by your instruments. but you do need to feed<br/>
yourself on a day to day basis and you will still spend your time outside<br/>
guild events swinging swords so you do have a legitimate use for haste<br/>
items.  so, if your guild was saying that the up front melee people need<br/>
haste items first, i would agree with them.  then your problem is that in<br/>
such a large guild, there will always be someone in front of you.  although,<br/>
you should be able to field a group to go camp for a sash in guk.  but<br/>
taking you out of the lotto entirely is pretty bad.  i&#39;d be looking for a<br/>
new guild (although i&#39;d never have joined or stayed in such a large one<br/>
anyways.)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>
&gt; lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
&gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; any ideas? </span></blockquote></div>
