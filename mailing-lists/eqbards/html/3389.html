<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-436637599">Ok, I am now convinced beyond all doubt that there is something<br/>
going on in Kithicor.  What that something is I cannot fathom.  I spent a<br/>
couple hours there last night and ran into some interesting things, though<br/>
not particularly Bardic ones.<br/>
	First I ran into one of the named Shraloc orcs for the first time.<br/>
It was Renlik, or something close to that.  He was a reasonable fight for a<br/>
15th measure bard and carried several gp and a bronze longsword.  I then<br/>
found a small house, where none had been before btw, with a gypsy merchant<br/>
in it selling herbs.  I haven&#39;t seen these herbs anywhere else, but its been<br/>
quite a while since I visited Halas.  She offered me 3.3pp for the sword.<br/>
Figuring I&#39;d get a better price from a merchant I knew well I told Elsbyth<br/>
no thanks and headed off to Rivervale.  On the way I ran into two gray<br/>
wolves, something else I have never seen in Kithicor before, and I hae spent<br/>
a fair amount of time hunting undead and scarabs there some time back.  I<br/>
killed one of the gray wolves, hoping to find a good pelt and low and behold<br/>
I got this feeling that someone wasn&#39;t happy about my killing a wolf in<br/>
Kithicor.  Fortuantely not that Holly Windstalker kind of right before you<br/>
die kind of feeling, but more of a prickling along the back of your neck you<br/>
get when your &#39;Wolf&#39; faction takes a hit.  Next thing I know it did just<br/>
that!  Since when is there a faction of Wolves?  Unnerved I walked around<br/>
the other gray wolf and smack into a wolf.  Not a black wolf, not a shadow<br/>
wolf, or gray wolf.  Just a wolf.  He was looking at me in that hungry way<br/>
wolves do so I attacked him before he could jump my back.  He was about as<br/>
tough as the gray, but not as quick to run.  But he had the most remarkable<br/>
pelt, one of medium quality!  This was the first time I had ever seen a pelt<br/>
above Low quality mind ou and the first time I had ever seen &#39;a wolf&#39;.<br/>
Again though I felt that icy hand of lowering &#39;Wolf&#39; faction gripping my<br/>
shoulder as the beast fell dead.  Now every time I see any kind of wolf I<br/>
shudder, and wonder who they are reporting to.  Every person I meet is<br/>
quickly scanned for signs of wolf sympathies.  I know they are out there,<br/>
and they are not amused.  <br/>
	Happily trotted into Rivervale, ah the wonders of halfling<br/>
civilization.  Rolled up to my friend Twippie and showed him the sword.<br/>
He&#39;s been kindly to me for almost as long as I can remember so he always<br/>
gives me great prices.  He took one look at the word and offered me 2.7pp.<br/>
I reeled in shock, the gypsy woman had offered me more than my old friend<br/>
Twippie?  I was stunned.  I checked around town and Twippie&#39;s deal was not<br/>
to be beat.  Thinking that gypsy needed more investigation I ran back into<br/>
Kithicor to find her.  Well, the house was there still, but of Elsbyth there<br/>
was no sign.  I searched around a bit until I spotted a wolf following me.<br/>
It was weird, I turned, he turned, just sauntering along.  at that wee hour<br/>
of the morning it was too much to bear and I hightailed it back to<br/>
Rivervale.  Maybe in the daylight I&#39;d look for Elsbyth again, but not at<br/>
night.<br/>
