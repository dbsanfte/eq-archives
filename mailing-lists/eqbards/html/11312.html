<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750085089">It sets your faction to the racial base, plus whatever modifiers you have<br/>
built up during play.  So, if you haven&#39;t raised your Felwithe faction you<br/>
will be as KoS as any other Dark Elf.  If you kill a lot of Dark Elf guards,<br/>
you could be KoS in Neriak even with the Guise.<br/>

I saw a Erudite banking peacefully in Felwithe, and fire off his guise<br/>
(showing off or by accident) and the pair of bankers promptly destroyed<br/>
him. I&#39;ve never seen a L50 die that fast.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why this happened, but I don&#39;t believe his Felwithe faction was<br/>
abnormally low. Anyone else know?<br/>
