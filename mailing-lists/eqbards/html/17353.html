Full Bronze at level 11 and you are suggesting that she look at upgrades?<br/>
<br/>
I would put forth the notion that you are very well equiped for your level.<br/>
Furthermore, I would say that for the short term, you really don&#39;t need to<br/>
upgrade anything. (Here comes the old timer statement) When I was your age,<br/>
I had a full set of patchwork. (and a pair of Bronze Vambraces that I paid<br/>
22 p for)<br/>
<br/>
Now, I do agree with Sylly&#39;s advice. When it&#39;s time to upgrade, you will<br/>
want to get rid of that heavy (and ugly) bronze. The next step from bronze<br/>
is usually Lambent, although on a few pieces banded will suffice (being<br/>
nearly the same ac, but much lighter)<br/>
<br/>
For weapons you are in the same boat, you have very good weapons for your<br/>
level. (again, I was wielding a rusty scimitar at that level) Weapons are a<br/>
whole other story for bards though. If you decide to be an instrument bard,<br/>
you could conceivably put down those weapons at 20 and not see them for<br/>
10-20 levels.<br/>
<br/>
Like Silly said, Level is God, AC is king, and resists are your friends.<br/>
Most other stats have not shown that they have a significant impact on<br/>
combat.<br/>

Greetings and Welcome Melodii!!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are pretty well equipped in armor and weapons.  Although, I<br/>
would suggest that you review your bronze armor and look at the weight to AC<br/>
ratio of each piece - iirc, some give lots more ac per pound that others.<br/>
Making those &#39;others&#39; key candidates for replacement with things that may<br/>
have a touch less ac but perhaps some other stats (dex+, mr+, etc.)  If I<br/>
were you, I would be looking for jewelry and other items with magic<br/>
resistance, poison resistance (snakes are good from your level thru 13-15<br/>
iicr), or strength.  Level is God, AC is King & Resist items are you best<br/>
friends. Buffs are very nice too :)  There are also the &#39;classic&#39; bard<br/>
things: elf hide gloves, troll hide belt, mask of the deceiver (you are too<br/>
young to fight for one but might be able to loot one if you brave the depths<br/>
of Upper and Lower Guk - the Mask comes from a mid 30&#39;s camp.  Just some<br/>
thoughts.  Keep us posted on your progress.<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow Bards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and I would like to say that it is wonderful the<br/>
&gt; information that is shared among the bards of EQ. I am a lvl 11 Bard on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Karana server and I need some information please.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My question is this....what kind of armor, weapons, and instruments would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; worthy of investment for me at this point?<br/>
