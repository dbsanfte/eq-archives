<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366830411">Had a guild party camping the one in Kaesora for about five to six hours.<br/>
The mob that drops it only spawned twice and never had the coin.  We were<br/>
the only people in Kaesora at the time so at least there were enough mobs<br/>
to keep us happy.  Have had the other five coins in the bank for probably a<br/>
year now.<br/>

&gt; Good quest -- easier and harder than you might think.  If you have a good <br/>
&gt;guild that raids a bit, look to hit City of Mist, Kaesora and get a good <br/>
&gt;group together to hunt scorpikus&#39;s in the canyon in the Overthere (beware <br/>
&gt;the harm touch) --<br/>
&gt;Otherwise you can buy these coins for varying amounts.  I have seen the <br/>
&gt;Kaesora coin auctioned for up to 400pp -- too much IMHO but it is probably <br/>
&gt;the hardest to come by.  <br/>
&gt;If you are going to buy the coins though -- a walrus skin drum goes for 1K <br/>
&gt;on Rodcet Nife and probably similar amounts elsewhere.  It is a better drum <br/>
&gt;and if you have the cash on hand, takes a lot less time to get )<br/>
