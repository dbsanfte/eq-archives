<div id="ygrps-yiv-330113356">But you can&#39;t say that for everyone.  Some people don&#39;t think it is fun<br/>
taking the long way.  They like shortcuts (and being able to cheat and<br/>
exploit - I am not one of them by the way).   I have a friend that I work<br/>
with that won&#39;t even buy EverQuest because he can&#39;t cheat.  He is the type<br/>
that looks on the Internet for cheat codes for a game and then buys the<br/>
game.  If he can&#39;t find any cheat codes - he won&#39;t buy it.  Asinine?  Yes.<br/>
But that is what he enjoys.  Does that make us any better because we don&#39;t<br/>
like to cheat?  No way.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with some of your points - however I can tell you that twinking will<br/>
not ruin the experience, especially if it is a second character.  With my<br/>
primary character, I have been to every single zone in the game except for<br/>
Solusek A and B and Kedge Keep.  Twinking a second character does not<br/>
detract from the experience of the game - it just makes the monotony of the<br/>
lower levels a little bit easier, and may cut down on the deaths  that you<br/>
would normally get from learning experience.   <br/>
<br/>
If this is a first time character for him, even being in full bronze at that<br/>
level will not matter much.  Full bronze is only 1 point greater than<br/>
banded, and alot heavier.  Also your AC is directly related to your Defense<br/>
skill (and other modifiers.)  He is still capped at Level * 5, so at the<br/>
most he would get maybe a 20-25 point increase in his AC rating.<br/>

&gt; &gt; First of all, having better equipment doesn&#39;t mean you explore *less*.<br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; means (for instance) being able to go to High Hold, or the Eastern<br/>
&gt; Karanas,<br/>
&gt; &gt; a level earlier than you normally could. Nor does it affect knowledge of<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipment- at level 13, you&#39;re either wearing leather, banded, or<br/>
&gt; bronze,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having better equipment means you will have an easier time<br/>
&gt; against mobs - there&#39;s no denying that, otherwise there&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; no point to getting better equipment.  When you have an easier<br/>
&gt; time against mobs -&gt; you rack up experience faster -&gt; you<br/>
&gt; level more quickly -&gt; you have less time to explore areas<br/>
&gt; appropriate for your level -&gt; you explore less.  Unless of<br/>
&gt; course you refrain from fighting, or enjoy exploring areas<br/>
&gt; where everything is green to you and afraid to attack you<br/>
&gt; (which I had to do with most of Paw and all of Blackburrow -<br/>
&gt; and which is why I don&#39;t give others advice on how to play<br/>
&gt; there, except for location information).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a quest item or two mixed in (again, the quests are made MORE fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; because, just maybe, you can now solo the mob that&#39;s eluded you for the<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; two levels, not less.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This gets back to what I said about there always being<br/>
&gt; something bigger and meaner than you.  You do not get more<br/>
&gt; quests, you simply get different (higher level) ones.  The low<br/>
&gt; level quests that would normally mean something to someone<br/>
&gt; your level are now worthless because your equipment is already<br/>
&gt; better than what you&#39;d receive as a reward.  In the end, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a washout.  Yes you get to do your L10-L15 quests in a hurry,<br/>
&gt; but now the quests that were supposed to sustain you from L16<br/>
&gt; to L25 have to sustain you from L13 to L25.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Second, 250pp is not 250,000. Yes, that will buy you a set of bronze,<br/>
&gt; but it<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean you must immediately stop looking for better stuff until<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; make 10 more levels. On the contrary- it means you can save up money for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; *truly* useful items, like some elf hide gloves (if you&#39;re not an elf,<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is &lt;G&gt;) or a battle drum. It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t follow your reasoning at all.  You can keep the crown,<br/>
&gt; and save up for banded/bronze.  If you run across someone<br/>
&gt; selling elf hide gloves or a battle drum, you can sell/trade<br/>
&gt; the crown then.  If you aren&#39;t so fortunate, then you still<br/>
&gt; have the crown.  Like I said, the crown is rare enough that<br/>
&gt; you can get trade-only items for it.  That gives it the edge<br/>
&gt; over saving platinum IMHO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; actually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; hundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade<br/>
&gt; skills<br/>
&gt; &gt; or even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>
&gt; &gt; much more than that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if money is that easy, why sell the crown?  I hit 100pp at<br/>
&gt; around L13 by the way.  Accounting for all the stuff I gave<br/>
&gt; away, I probably hit 250pp around L18.  I had 250pp in the<br/>
&gt; bank at around L20.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finally, why is having a full set of bronze, a dirk, and money in the<br/>
&gt; bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; (i.e., not having to worry about where your next song is coming from-<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; was a very real concern to me at that level) somehow less &#39;noble&#39; or<br/>
&gt; &#39;fair&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; than wearing all patchwork except for an admittedly very nice crown on<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; head?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When did I say it was less noble?  In this thread, I said it<br/>
&gt; was robbing yourself of experience.  In a previous meta-issues<br/>
&gt; thread I said it upset the balance of the game.  I have never<br/>
&gt; criticized twinking because I felt it was unfair or ignoble.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only criticized it because I felt it caused problems for<br/>
&gt; the twinker (which doesn&#39;t really matter because it&#39;s his<br/>
&gt; decision to deprive himself) and for the non-twinker (which<br/>
&gt; does matter since he doesn&#39;t have any control it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; other. But using a fairly gotten reward to make the next few levels less<br/>
&gt; &gt; painful- to, perhaps, get to see High Hold or Unrest a few days ahead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time- isn&#39;t exactly cheating, at least in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me use your example.  Would it be wise to do something<br/>
&gt; which lets you, say, see Mistmoore a few days ahead of time,<br/>
&gt; *before* you&#39;ve had a chance to thoroughly explore/experience<br/>
&gt; Unrest and Highhold?  If you&#39;ve seen it all already with<br/>
&gt; another character, then I completely agree with you.  But I<br/>
&gt; got the impression that wasn&#39;t the case here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want to fully experience the game, don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; shortcuts.<br/>
