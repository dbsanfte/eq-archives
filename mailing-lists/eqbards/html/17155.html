&gt; behind him assuming a sample size ration that was present, 20-1.  It was<br/>
&gt; close, he did 33% more damage than I did.  Same level, same weapons.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>20 fights is an awfully small sample to be drawing this type<br/>
of conclusion.  I can see what you&#39;re doing (assume normal<br/>
PDFs, find number of incidents counter to expectation, using<br/>
that figure out the translation in the two PDFs to have that<br/>
probability of counter-expectations), but it&#39;s still just a<br/>
roundabout way of deriving the two damage histograms.  Just<br/>
find the two histograms directly via parsing.<br/>
