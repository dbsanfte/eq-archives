<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962447503">Wow I disagree with Harm??? Unheard of almost.  Actually you might as well<br/>
be right though.  From the parsings I&#39;ve done a mob will. regardless of<br/>
level, hit you for 80% of its max or more 80% or so of the time it hits you<br/>
for more than 1.  As you go up in levels you should see more misses and more<br/>
hits for 1, at least thats what my logs have shown so far.  The amount of<br/>
hits I see between 1 and 80% of max hasn&#39;t changed much for most mobs<br/>
despite gaining 12 levels since I started checking.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>
&gt; appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>
&gt; teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>
&gt; per hit. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Giants have and will always hit for ~96 dmg.  Your level makes<br/>
  little difference in the amount of the attack.  Yes, they miss<br/>
  you a lot more often, but a L42 ice giant&#39;s consistant hit is 116,<br/>
  it was 116 when I was L14, and it still is 116 at L50.<br/>
<br/>
  Regardless of level the monster will strike usually in the upper<br/>
  80% of their damage range unless they outright miss you.<br/>
