<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576651875">Highland Lions are FAST, at least for me (I was soloing them all day<br/>
yesterday), they definitly outrun me without the drum equipped, and<br/>
pretty kept up with my drum equipped...  Griffawns I had no trouble<br/>
with... (except for the fact that they hit about twice as hard as any<br/>
other melee mob I know of at their level)<br/>

&gt;         By the time you have lullaby, you really shouldn&#39;t have any problems<br/>
&gt; outrunning highland lions or griffawns (unless they repeatedly stun you, in<br/>
&gt; which case lullaby wouldn&#39;t help anyway)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         I think the only things you&#39;ll have problems outrunning are<br/>
&gt; shadowmen, grimfeather, and those damn casters in MM (they always seem to<br/>
&gt; kill me before I can Selo&#39;s out of range).<br/>
