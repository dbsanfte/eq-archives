while grounds for allowing an investigation of the person in pending rape<br/>
cases in their area are not grounds for refusing to let them into the local<br/>
grocery store.<br/>

Reading between the lines - I think what we may have here is yet another<br/>
case of a company that can never admit they made a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have theorized that Verant THOUGHT they were banning the author<br/>
of the rape story.  If THAT story is as bad as has been implied (I haven&#39;t<br/>
read it) - I think that Verant has a case.  IMHO - the issue isn&#39;t so grey<br/>
in dealing with that issue.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they thought they were banning the author of that<br/>
story - and after responding &quot;This is a private matter between Verant and<br/>
the Individual&quot; line - they didn&#39;t want to back off - even after realizing<br/>
the banned the wrong individual...<br/>

Hopefully someone has posted this to the FAC board.  They are a group that<br/>
actively fights First Amendment Abridgements pro bono.  I can&#39;t find the<br/>
link or I would post it myself.  Obviously Verant has never heard of Larry<br/>
Flynt or they probably would have taken a different course in this case.<br/>

Yea I&#39;m just starting to read some of this thread.  Its pretty crazy.  I am<br/>
not someone who really gets excited about much, but this really irks.<br/>
Enough so to consider action.  The only action I can take, which is not play<br/>
EQ and not pay them any more money.  Perhaps someone who enjoys doing this<br/>
should organize a protest this weekend.  I might even show up for this one<br/>
:-)<br/>
