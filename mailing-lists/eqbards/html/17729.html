enchanters rely more heavily on charisma (crowd control), they<br/>
should get priority over bards.  Did they just say that you<br/>
couldn&#39;t have the item, or did they say that normally you<br/>
could but they felt it be best for the enchanter to get this<br/>
one?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Out of curiosity, what level was the enchanter?  A lot of<br/>
factors usually go into these decisions, including level,<br/>
skill, niceness, amount of time spent with the guild/alliance,<br/>
etc.<br/>
