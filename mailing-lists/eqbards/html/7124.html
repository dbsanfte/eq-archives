<div id="ygrps-yiv-868755710">Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far.  Once again a reminder, I&#39;m not looking<br/>
to send in an email asking for new features added, just for fixes to current<br/>
problems, or at least estimates on when we can expect things to be fixed.  I<br/>
want answers, not changes.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>
they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>
at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>
get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>
questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
2) Several of our skills (Hiding, Sneak, Forage) cap at such<br/>
low levels, that they aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of<br/>
these, but if the caps were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>
1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
3) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>
effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>
does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>
it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>
this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
<br/>
4) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
5) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>
implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>
<br/>
6) Recent patches have had a serious impact on the song Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
with the following negative side effects:  This song no longer breaks root.<br/>
We were under the impression that this was an intended benefit, is this a<br/>
bug, or has this functionality been intentionally removed?  Also SoW now<br/>
overrides our song, in effect cancelling it out.  Many bards have already<br/>
complained about having SoW intentionally cast on them as a form of<br/>
harassment.  Are there any plans to A) make SoW removable by clicking on it<br/>
as was recently done for levetate, or B) make it so that Selo&#39;s overrides<br/>
SoW, but when Selo&#39;s wears off, or goes out of range, SoW will continue to<br/>
work.  When could we expect such a change to occur?<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to make any contibutions/suggestion/changes that you feel<br/>
are appropriate.  I want this letter to be a consensus of what we feel are<br/>
our major problems.  Again, I&#39;m not looking for new things that it would be<br/>
nice to have added to our class, just the most important current problems<br/>
that should be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
John Kim had a lot of really good suggestions, but if I include them all,<br/>
this letter would be waaay too long.  I&#39;m trying to concentrate on some of<br/>
the larger issues.  If it gets too long, I have a fear that GZ wouldn&#39;t even<br/>
bother to read it.  I&#39;ve flagged John&#39;s email for Letter Number 2 &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Maybe not everyone considers the missing drum graphic a serious<br/>
problem, but this is a big peeve of mine.  I can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t<br/>
fixed this at some point in the last 5 months.<br/>
