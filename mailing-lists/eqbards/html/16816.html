<div id="ygrps-yiv-774223248">This is something that ties to basic design of the Bard class itself.<br/>
<br/>
  In early beta, the Bard sang his/her song to everyone around them.<br/>

In beta 4, my friends used to joke that bard hate was so strong, mobs would <br/>
come from other zones just to whack me.  I always figured orcs just hated <br/>
music.  It was so bad I got to the point I never played any songs in GF or <br/>
I&#39;d draw  a huge crowd of booing mobs all armed with rotting vegetables.<br/>
