<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686379443">Full?  Whats that?  I saw post from Dragons last week where they took 11<br/>
groups to a Vox raid.  hehe, too funny.  I guess that&#39;s good for those that<br/>
want to go everyone gets to go but 11 is just insane.<br/>

<br/>
same on tholuxe paells. dragons are booked weeks ahead and die shortly after<br/>
servers coming up. normally you can sign for open/invite dragon raids (which<br/>
they usually are) one or two weeks before the raid.<br/>
when raids are actually running you normally have no chance of joining since<br/>
groups are full most of the time.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about Xegony, but on Tunare generally the dragons die within 12<br/>
hours of the servers coming up.  That, and we use a reservation type system<br/>
(based on EzBoard) where leaders will sign up for entire weeks such that<br/>
they can lead given a patch day or a regular respawn and anyone interested<br/>
in joining the raid can contact them well ahead of time.  Oh, the dragons<br/>
are booked months ahead of time on Tunare, too, just as something to<br/>
possibly look forward to dependent on your server.<br/>

  Just starting the epic quest at 52nd and hoping to get into one or two<br/>
  more Naggy/Vox dragon raids on Xegony before I hit 53rd. So I wanted try<br/>
  this idea out on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
  On my second account would it make sense to create two first level rogues?<br/>
  One Barb to sneak and park in EF/Perm and one DE to sneak and park in<br/>
  Lava/Sol B?<br/>
<br/>
  While I&#39;m playing Tzeetch, I&#39;m thinking I could check for late night raids<br/>
  on the second account. (My usual playing time is 10pm ~ 2am PDT.) Sounds<br/>
  simple, but since I haven&#39;t heard of anyone discuss I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m<br/>
  missing something.<br/>
<br/>
  Btw, any fellow Xegony Bards know of any Friday raids going on for these<br/>
  two? I have the day off from family and work this Friday :-).<br/>
