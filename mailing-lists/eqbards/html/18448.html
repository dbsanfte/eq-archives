thought it was one of your groupmates. ;-)<br/>

I plan on starting against blues.  I&#39;ve gotten good at using Selo&#39;s and<br/>
Chains to split mobs.  I slow one with chains and when it stops following<br/>
Istop and kill the other, closer one.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the advice I&#39;ll let ya all know how it goes.  I have<br/>
discovered though that at 25 my all instrument attack is far weaker than my<br/>
melee.  Its probably because I have such a good primary weapon (Harpoon of<br/>
the Depths).  I cannot come close to defeating the mobs I beat with melee<br/>
using solely instruments.  The main problem is all the song drops from<br/>
bashing.  In melee that doesn&#39;t hurt me much but in all instrument it&#39;s<br/>
fatal.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing I hate more than when running past a stupid skel 1/4th my level I<br/>
get the &quot;bashed for 1, stunned, Selo&#39;s drops&quot;.  What a joke.<br/>

Sorry Kit, off hand I dont recognize that shield.  Now for fear chain stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, like vintage wine - all bard songs tend to get better with some<br/>
age.  Song effect is tested against level difference - when you first get<br/>
songs - resists are high.  Also missed notes if the underlying skill is not<br/>
maxxed and screetch is brass - make sure your brass is maxxed to the level.<br/>
<br/>
Screetch when it sticks and does not end early lasts 3 ticks.  Ideally you<br/>
could:<br/>
<br/>
fear (mob runs)<br/>
chain (mob slows)<br/>
warsong (you hasten)<br/>
<br/>
fear (mob runs)<br/>
chain (mob slows)<br/>
warsong (you hasten)<br/>
(rinse, repeat)<br/>
<br/>
When it is feared, it does not hit you.  Come up behind a mob.  Fear it.  If<br/>
you fear does not stick on the first try, it will turn and hit you. Keep<br/>
fearing it until it runs. Then chain it. Then buff yourself. Then right away<br/>
fear it again. Or skip the buff and do fear/chain only and you will have a<br/>
second try if fear is resisted once it sticks.  If you get a resist, keep<br/>
fearing until it sticks.<br/>
<br/>
Fresh songs with high resist rates can be painfull so try it on the weakest<br/>
stuff you can find and expect it ti get better as you add levels.  I got<br/>
poor results when I first got the song and put it away for many levels.<br/>
Then in my mid-30&#39;s I tried it again and got excellent results.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to hook up with a ranger or a druid who can stick snare on<br/>
the mob.  Then you can fear until it sticks then melee buff.<br/>
<br/>
In practice, find a good open area and pull your mobs here (if they are not<br/>
there already).  It&#39;s better to have them run over known safe ground that<br/>
run into places you are not sure of.  Also, you need to be very close to the<br/>
mob.  Yes, it is AE but smaller radius than you may think and Kunark mobs<br/>
have large melee ranges - so you need to get up close and personal to play<br/>
the song.  That&#39;s why if you can start from behind and get fear in first,<br/>
you are one step ahead of things.  If you have to pull, then chain so they<br/>
hit you slower while you try to stick that first fear on an agro mob.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know how you fare,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
&gt; weapons...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
&gt; better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
&gt; wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
&gt; the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>
