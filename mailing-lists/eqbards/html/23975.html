<div id="ygrps-yiv-259715834">I&#39;m going to have to play devil&#39;s advocate here a little bit.  There ARE PvP<br/>
players - who are as passionate about EQ PvP as we are about EQ Bards (I<br/>
talked with quite a few of them at the Baltimore Fan Faire).  Also don&#39;t<br/>
forget - that a goodly number of people on the Blue Servers like to Duel<br/>
from time to time - and don&#39;t forget Test of Tactics 2.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play PvP and I don&#39;t duel - but it IS a part of the game - and<br/>
Verant has to expend SOME amount of resources to support it.  If they are<br/>
going to designate a Bard song as purely for PvP - so be it - but I&#39;d like<br/>
to see them be more open about it - if this is the case.<br/>
<br/>
I for one have to agree with Dean that I think that for the majority of EQ<br/>
Bards - DDD is a joke...<br/>

Only a fool would make the argument that all bards are posted here.  That is<br/>
so totally ludicrous as to almost be unanswerable if it were not so<br/>
offensive.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can see that there are three pvp servers, each on the lower end of<br/>
the population base and easily determine how many people at any one time are<br/>
playing in a potential pvp environment.  Even if those people were all<br/>
playing pvp all the time and never playing pve, their number would still be<br/>
insignificant compared to the overall number of players.<br/>
<br/>
Get a clue, this is NOT a pvp game except for a very, very, very, tiny<br/>
minority.<br/>

<br/>
ok, how many people out of the total subscribers play bards?  by the numbers<br/>
posted here, less than 5%.  by your argument, then bards and their issues<br/>
are<br/>
insignificant because less than 5% of the people who play everquest are<br/>
affected.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s only insignificant if you&#39;re not the one it&#39;s affecting.<br/>
