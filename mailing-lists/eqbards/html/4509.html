<b>Subject:</b> Skill Points <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-318719436">Is it me or does anyone else wish they had placed their starting points (the<br/>
ones for STR, CHR, INT, WIS, etc, etc..) a little differently? My main<br/>
curiosity is - why can&#39;t you increase these numbers with skill points?<br/>
And/or why don&#39;t they also go up like your skills do as you get older and<br/>
more experienced? It doesn&#39;t make sense to me that a newly born Bard at<br/>
level 1 will have the same strength as he/she would at level 50. What, it&#39;s<br/>
not logical that he/she would gain more strength as he/she got older and<br/>
matured? Would the Bard (or any other class) not be able to go to their<br/>
guild and maybe study something that would make them more intelligent? Could<br/>
the Bard not go to their guild and train in the ways of interacting with<br/>
people to improve their CHR scores? See what I&#39;m getting at?<br/>
<br/>
I think of say a Warrior that has the same strength fighting little decaying<br/>
skeletons as he will when he&#39;s fighting Lady Vox and it&#39;s just plain silly.<br/>
I&#39;d love to see Verrant make it so that you could spend you skill points in<br/>
modifiers as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.</div>
