<div id="ygrps-yiv-241569622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Still, I leave those groups as soon as I can.  The fact is that they <br/>
&gt; are dead wrong to think that the mana song is the only useful thing <br/>
&gt; that I can play, and I don&#39;t like being in a group that is both stupid<br/>
&gt; and insistent that I go along with their stupidity.  Those are the<br/>
&gt; groups that get me killed.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Amen brother, if I am getting beat down constantly, I will leave.<br/>
  But if the group is working good enough, and the exp is rolling<br/>
  in decently, with little downtime.  I&#39;ll save my bardic speech<br/>
  for another time.  I&#39;ll be the first to jet, if things suck.<br/>

&gt; rooms), at level 34, I was getting about 50% resists.  This shuts <br/>
&gt; down half of the goblins <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  frogloks ;p   I&#39;ll have to return to Guk to re-evalute the song.<br/>
  In the lord room, I got my ass seriously kicked when I tried to<br/>
  sleep frogs.<br/>

  No disrespect meant song brother.  Just trying to cut the illusion<br/>
  we often give of ourselves as being slightly more powerful than<br/>
  we are in reality.  After all, we are storytellers, and we have<br/>
  to make ourselves look good in the public eye.  If you didnt solo<br/>
  like 5 hill giants at once with half your hp, and two rusty<br/>
  daggers, what good are you?<br/>
<br/>
  Just like that one bard claiming to solo hill giants using charm<br/>
  at level 30.  I think that was a pretty tall tale.  Ask Sylly how<br/>
  her charming experience went when she was doing it at level 34.<br/>
  But, hell, it sure sounded good!  Impress your friends ;-)<br/>
