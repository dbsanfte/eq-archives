<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-268198364">I was in Najena last nite helping a guildmate get a quest item and noticed<br/>
something disturbing.  In the past I have been there quite a few times at<br/>
20th and 21st level.  I have solo&#39;d several of the elementals there many<br/>
times and never had trouble with any other than the fire.  Last nite I was<br/>
attacked by a green earth elemental and was quite surprised at the result.<br/>
It knocked me down to a single bubble very quickly.  I have fought two of<br/>
these at a time before in Najena at this level and had little trouble.  Has<br/>
anyone else noticed that elementals have become much tougher since the<br/>
patches last week?  I fought a similar conning one in Najena 2 weeks ago and<br/>
took less than a bubble.  Last nite I got killed by two green earth<br/>
elementals that wandered by our fighting.  I was getting hit for 40+ points<br/>
on some hits?  The two I killed gave me no xp, which I expected.  Could some<br/>
of the changes made last week have changed this?  As it is now these guys<br/>
are nearly as tough as griffawns of similar con.<br/>
