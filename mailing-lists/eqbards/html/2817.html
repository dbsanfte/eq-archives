 </span></blockquote>Yesterday I was hunting in CB, and thinking of lore stuff a lot - place is<br/>
full of it.<br/>
<br/>
The change to only have one of any particular lore item - and making most<br/>
of these items lore is one I applaude the intent behind, but it also raises<br/>
some NEW problems.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I WEAR the dwarven tunic (pending lore at the moment) what if<br/>
I want to ALSO get the screaming mace - the tunic is a component.<br/>
<br/>
Another example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>
<br/>
While I think it&#39;s a good thing that folks are discouraged from camping and<br/>
accumulating a dozen of an item, and then squirrling them away, or hauling<br/>
them to the furthest reaches for sale - selling these items IS a legitimate<br/>
trade. By basically ruling out getting another, if you already have one in<br/>
hand - you are guaranteeing that the folks hunting these critters are gonna<br/>
be higher levels - and have already moved past personal use of said item.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already noticed this shift. The only thing that it DOES help with -<br/>
they get one, move on to sell it, but then they are right back.  Since they<br/>
are much higher levels, very easy to swipe a kill of one of these mobs from<br/>
someone around the &#39;appropriate&#39; level to be hunting them.<br/>
<br/>
This also of course presents a problem if your friend dies, gives you<br/>
consent to loot - and you BOTH have an item - his is gonna poof.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what the answer to this problem is - I do think Verant had good<br/>
intentions with this change, and I agree something needed to be done,<br/>
however - is the way it&#39;s been implemented causing more new problems than<br/>
it solved of old?<br/>
<br/>
One change I think might mitigate the problems - and keep the original<br/>
intent - let someone only have one of an item in their inventory or bank -<br/>
but equipped doesn&#39;t count. If item in question, say the tunic is equipped,<br/>
it&#39;s not lore WHILE equipped (or is, but just doesn&#39;t count towards this<br/>
rule) - you may have ONE in your inventory or bank as well - or the dragoon<br/>
dirk, you may then wield two of them if you choose. Also solves the problem<br/>
of looting a friends corpse if you happen to be equipped in a similar set<br/>
of goods - or actually be able to hunt for ONE of an item to sell, and ONE<br/>
(or two in the case of the dirk) to use - from a critter of appropriate<br/>
level. In some cases - you might even want ONE in the bank - in case of<br/>
death for personal use - not sure how corpses count, might need to make<br/>
sure if equipping from you corpse directly to your inventory slots doesn&#39;t<br/>
affect it. In any case, I think that might be the rarest scenario, and one<br/>
should visit the bank first to remove said item.<br/>
<br/>
In short, there is no perfect solution to camping - Verant made a good<br/>
faith effort towards stemming it, if we could just get them to now address<br/>
the sideissues that the change itself made - I do believe we&#39;ll be a whole<br/>
lot closer to the original intent.<br/>
<br/>
Whatcha think?</div>
