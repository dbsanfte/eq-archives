<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653617842">Yes you can place items on mobs. Often times when I forage something, or<br/>
just got done looting a mob, and another agro mob attacks, I simply click<br/>
the item to the mod, kill it then retrieve the items.<br/>
<br/>
Which if bards had a more permanent charm song could really make a mean pack<br/>
animal/monster exploit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1) Lazy players - Although it might seem &#39;nice&#39; to give that<br/>
&gt; &gt; barbed leather<br/>
&gt; &gt; whip you just upgraded, to a lower level character, this<br/>
&gt; &gt; slowly tends to<br/>
&gt; &gt; breed a dependance & you&#39;ll start to see an increase of<br/>
&gt; &gt; item/cash beggers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Case in point..I was standing outside the bank at Qeynos a week or so ago<br/>
&gt; and a player named &quot;Crimany&quot; or something similar was begging every player<br/>
&gt; that walked by for platinum or spare weapons or armor. I was doing songs<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; waiting for a friend so I was there a bit.. This guy asked no less than 20<br/>
&gt; people and was there before I got there and after I left. The worst part<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; that you could watch as he actually got a lot of stuff from people. (You<br/>
&gt; could see him put it on) I know people like to be nice, as do I, but<br/>
what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the point of this person playing the game? (By the way, he was level 2 and<br/>
&gt; definitely not a &quot;restarted&quot; character)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Upgraded that whip & don&#39;t feel like dealing with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hassle of selling it?  Go give it to a beetle<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the commons, then invis & watch he glee of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; newbie who finds it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does that actually work? You can give an item to a monster and if they get<br/>
&gt; killed, it&#39;s still on the body to recover? If so that&#39;s a completely<br/>
&gt; fantastic idea and I&#39;ll start doing that immediately with all the rusty<br/>
&gt; stuff I find and maybe the occasional tidbit. Thank you!!!! (No sarcasm<br/>
&gt; what-so-ever, this is a really great idea!) By the way, if this actually<br/>
&gt; does work - is there any kind of time limit as to how long it&#39;ll stay with<br/>
&gt; the monster?<br/>
