<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524759324">heh tell me about it.  i built a new system about 2 weeks before kunark was<br/>
released.  125 days played plus 2 phases of beta, 15 months of subscribing,<br/>
a new computer.  this game costs too much money and time!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I wonder how many people upgraded PC&#39;s due to Kunark.  I had <br/>
&gt; been holding<br/>
&gt; out for some time.  Kunark killed my P2-300 Voodoo3 2000 box <br/>
&gt; - so I built an<br/>
&gt; Athlon 800 Geforce2 GTS box - and the game is so much cooler! <br/>
&gt;  Gotta love<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
