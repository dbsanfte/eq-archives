<b>Subject:</b> Re: Chains overwriting shaman slowdown <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827643169">I&#39;m pretty sure once their attack slowdown spell<br/>
(insects) is on that chain won&#39;t overwrite that.  They<br/>
will not be able to cast it on if you already have<br/>
chain on.  However, you should be able to notice this<br/>
for yourself.  Our slowdown doesn&#39;t even come close to<br/>
comparing to the shaman&#39;s.  You should visibly notice<br/>
if your chain was killing their slowdown.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure I&#39;ve stacked chain onto an enchanters slowdown<br/>
and the mob was still attacking VERY slow.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on another note, i&#39;d love a definitive answer to<br/>
&gt; this question, as it would<br/>
&gt; allow me to start chaining sooner if i am the snarer<br/>
&gt; in the group.  i group<br/>
&gt; with a shaman a lot, and obviously the shaman is in<br/>
&gt; charge of slowing the<br/>
&gt; mob.  so, if the shaman slows the mob, and i chain<br/>
&gt; the mob after, will the<br/>
&gt; chain cancel the shaman&#39;s slowdown?  i usually wait<br/>
&gt; til close to when the<br/>
&gt; mob is going to run cause i don&#39;t want to cancel the<br/>
&gt; slow.  if i am not<br/>
&gt; going to cancel it then i can start snaring earlier,<br/>
&gt; since i have recently<br/>
&gt; become accustomed to getting resisted a ton.<br/>
