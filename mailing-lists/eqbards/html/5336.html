 </span></blockquote>Blackened armor?  I thought BI armor had the AC of chain<br/>
(worse than banded) and weighed *more* than chain?  A<br/>
bloodstained tunic will run you about 200pp (all these<br/>
clerics, paladins, shamen, and rangers trying to get one<br/>
drives up the price) which is a lot of wisps at L11.<br/>
<br/>
At L11, I&#39;d suggest a Lockjaw hide vest or banded coat (banded<br/>
has better AC but is heavier).  Those should be about 25pp<br/>
each.  Chest and head/shoulder armor tends to have the best<br/>
AC/weight ratio so it&#39;s best to exploit that slight advantage.  <br/>
I&#39;d add a thick leather apron (1 more AC than plate, weighs<br/>
only 1 lb, around 25-50pp), snakeskin mask and gloves (leather<br/>
AC but lighter and adds +dex and +MR modifiers, 5pp each).  I<br/>
currently use the apron and plan to skip buying a plate girth.<br/>
The mask and gloves served me all the way up to L27, when I<br/>
finally switched to a plate mask (double the AC/weight ratio<br/>
of other plate pieces) and elfhide gloves.  You will also<br/>
probably want a bloodstained mantle since IIRC it is basically<br/>
chain, but +3 to str and +10 to MR.  Cost should be 30-70pp.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these items may be difficult to obtain or afford at<br/>
L11, but if you get them, I promise you will be using them for<br/>
a long long time.  (The vest is probably the shortest-lived, <br/>
but you can give it to a monk friend and make him very very<br/>
happy. :-)<br/>
