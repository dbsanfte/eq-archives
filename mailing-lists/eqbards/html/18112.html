<div id="ygrps-yiv-91072834">The main factor in sticking a song (or spell) is level difference.  Level<br/>
difference also affects how much damage you take when you get hit and how<br/>
able you are to endure it (ie you have more hp at higher levels and probably<br/>
better armor.)  So, you want to factor those things in when you engage in<br/>
combat. To my thinking, the risk/reward ratio is too flat.  Killing reds<br/>
does not reward you for your risk.  Killing blues has much return on time<br/>
invested.<br/>
<br/>
1. In NK, it seems that killing griffawns helps increase the chance of<br/>
griffeene (also griffon & GrimFeather too perhaps).  There is a spot near<br/>
the named Treant where fawns and feenes seem to spawn.  Look for a tower<br/>
thing and they spawn near there. Kill kill kill.<br/>
<br/>
2. I did not have luck charming stuff until level 35 or so.  Partly due to<br/>
some bad experiences early on and not really learning how - so I quit<br/>
dieing - err trying - well both.  Eventually, I learned to keep Selos going,<br/>
to charm, attack then run away.  Charm, run, rinse repeat.  Also, I learned<br/>
to zone a bad pull.  Also, learned /w all cleric 30 50 and /tell hello, are<br/>
you busy?<br/>
<br/>
Rathe Mts has some strange pathing problems.  The clops near the lake zone<br/>
are probably easier to deal with and the zone is close by.  Whereas the clop<br/>
near the hg&#39;s are further from the zone, nearer to more stuff that will agro<br/>
(hg&#39;s), and that area has some bad pathing issues (and mobs that will<br/>
teleport to you when the pathing is bad).<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion for level 27 is to try some Clops near the lake zone and be<br/>
ready to run.  Also, I&#39;d think that rooks and harriers in SK would be good -<br/>
and lots of wide open spaces to run around.<br/>
<br/>
But Choon vs Froon  seems to be a Bardic rite of passage.  If you have a<br/>
helper with SoW or Selos, things will go much better the first few times.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well spent most of my time this weekend trying to get Charm fighting<br/>
down with Griffawns and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Griffenes in NK. I have a couple of questions:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. I noticed (and assume) that killing Griffawns got the Griffenes to<br/>
spawn. Are they like Cyclops<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the Rather Mtn&#39;s were you have to basically kill everything (bears,<br/>
etc) to get more to spawn?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. What is a good level to start trying to charm cyclops in the Rathe<br/>
Mtns? I tried on a yellow and<br/>
&gt; &gt; was unsuccessful about 10 times in a row.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 27 when you first get it.  I was charming HGs and SGs with fair<br/>
success at level 28...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. Froon and Choon in WK. Do I have a reasonable shot and charm fighting<br/>
these 2 against each other?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These 2 were my very first experiment the moment I got the song at level<br/>
27 (after trying for 10 minutes<br/>
&gt; to get some help to take them out I was just curious if I could get it to<br/>
stick and was very surprised<br/>
&gt; when it did).  Took awhile to finish off the winner, but it fun and I got<br/>
my lambent vambraces and boots<br/>
&gt; out of the deal.  They both were con-red at the time.<br/>
