<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810589656">I have two friends, one a bard who has over 170 CHA, the other an enchanter<br/>
who also has enormously high CHA.  Both have assured me that once your CHA<br/>
passes 110 there is no longer a change in vendor prices.  And after 140<br/>
there is no change in the NPC consideration of you.  So I&#39;d say that once<br/>
you get over 110, only faction can help you more.  <br/>
<br/>
Charisma does help when buying from your own race.  My wizard only has 65<br/>
cha, but with a newbie enchanter at 95.  there was a 150 plat difference in<br/>
prices.  And I know my wizard has killed many a minotaur, so my racial<br/>
faction is higher than the newbie.<br/>

&gt;When i got my steel plate, i made a gnome enchanter and poured all points to<br/>
&gt;charisma.  since a gnome was buying from gnomes, more charisma had no effect<br/>
&gt;on prices.   the breastplate was 768pp, and they rest were slightly less<br/>
&gt;than your list as well.<br/>

&gt;Erisi, Level 15 Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; With more charisma, you should be able to get it for 787.5pp.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s my best price list again for small steel plate:<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; 787.5 Breastplate<br/>
&gt;&gt; 346.5 Boots<br/>
&gt;&gt; 252   Bracers<br/>
&gt;&gt; 420   Greaves<br/>
&gt;&gt; 294   Belt<br/>
&gt;&gt; 147   Collar<br/>
&gt;&gt; 483   Gloves<br/>
&gt;&gt; 336   Arms<br/>
&gt;&gt; 367.5 Pauldron<br/>
&gt;&gt; 367.5 Helm<br/>
&gt;&gt; 105   Mask<br/>
&gt;&gt; 399   Cloak<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The &quot;hidden&quot; base price is 5% below this (price/1.05).  The<br/>
&gt;&gt; best selling price is 5% below that.<br/>
