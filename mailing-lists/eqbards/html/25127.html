Hey Tzeetch - I was talking to Sebasstian last night (he got his epic) and<br/>
his guild (Death Knights) and Shards of Avalon did Gorenaire. He said it<br/>
wasn&#39;t too hard as long as you had enough (he said 15+) 55+ fire nukers.<br/>
<br/>
If you get good enough debuffers - even Druids can help against Gore.<br/>

Congrats!<br/>

Man, what a commitment. I&#39;m just starting the quest, so not much help with<br/>
the instrument question. But glad to see another Bard epic on Xegony.<br/>
<br/>
One question for you though, did you get the scales from Naggy and Vox?<br/>
I&#39;m really tired of waiting for those raids (most of my guild is above or<br/>
below the caps) but I hear the alternates like Gore are near impossible.<br/>
I&#39;m kissing 52 and just want to keep trucking to 55 without worrying about<br/>
the darn scales!<br/>

I&#39;m finally done with my epic! I knew it would be soon as the Maestro<br/>
finally dropped a 7 string when we were in Hate last Saturday. That meant<br/>
of course I would soon finish the epic and not need the lute. I do have a<br/>
question that I have not seen a clear answer on: is the epic as powerful<br/>
as all our best instruments or stronger in string, lesser in percussion?<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to figure out what instruments I don&#39;t need to carry<br/>
around<br/>
anymore.<br/>
