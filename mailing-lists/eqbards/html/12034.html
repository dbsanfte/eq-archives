<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933917163"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ah ok, can you tell i have done lots of quests? =) my assumption though was<br/>
&gt; based on the fact that it was not in brackets for one, while every other<br/>
&gt; item he gives is in brackets, and the fact that he says ask him about it<br/>
&gt; later, not now.  but good point, i didn&#39;t realize that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny, I met a NPC Bard in Qhills the other day. I had never noticed her<br/>
before (as I am a wood elf, never spent much time there) I hailed her<br/>
and she reponded something like &quot;Hello Uldar, I must warn you if you are<br/>
a fellow bard you won&#39;t make any profits with Lt. Soandso around&quot; (no<br/>
brackets, can&#39;t remember Lt&#39;s name). When I responded &quot;who is Lt.<br/>
Soandso&quot; she responded &quot;I will say no more on this matter&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was in the middle of something, and I assumed that if I ever found out<br/>
what she was talking about and it turned out to  be a quest I would get<br/>
a rusty weapon and 2cp for my trouble, so I left. BTW, she considered me<br/>
Kindy, so not a faction problem.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know anything about this wandering bard of Qhills? <br/>
