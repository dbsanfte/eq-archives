<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257378869">They&#39;re headhunters, pure and simple.  They operate very efficiently (like<br/>
most servers&#39; big guilds)... more like a business than a guild of friends.<br/>
They&#39;re there to be first to kill Suchandsuch and Wossname and obviously for<br/>
the loot.<br/>
<br/>
One friend in Prophecy summed it up by saying &quot;We are Prophecy.  You will be<br/>
assimilated.  Resistance is futile.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They are very attractive to post-50 players in smaller guilds.  The<br/>
Praetoriate have three members post-50 and they&#39;ve all expressed concerns<br/>
that its very difficult to hunt with your guild other than using an alt<br/>
character.  Luckily, we haven&#39;t lost anyone to Prophecy yet, but I dare say<br/>
that time may come.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, though, we have friends in the Forsaken Conclave, another<br/>
plane/dragon ready guild.  They&#39;re a great bunch of people.  If you haven&#39;t<br/>
already, try getting in touch with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A big problem on Bertox is that Prophecy (the big bad guild of the<br/>
server) constantly tries to recruit those over lvl 50, and DOA and other<br/>
guilds have lost a number of good players to them.  Prophecy can offer<br/>
literaly five hunts a week against either dragons, gods or big kunark<br/>
critters. The gear that is inherent to the frequency of those types of hunts<br/>
attracts the &quot;gear hungry&quot; types to them.<br/>
