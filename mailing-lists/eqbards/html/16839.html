<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701509002">Oh my, I didn&#39;t mean to rile anyone up over this.  Just to set the record<br/>
straight, I said I&#39;ve never been offered more than 7pp for a HQ Bear pelt.<br/>
I didn&#39;t say I&#39;d ever let one go for that.  The only one I&#39;ve given away was<br/>
to someone I knew.  And when you get right down to it, I probably would have<br/>
given it to him for nothing.  But we were both playing rogues and both<br/>
roleplaying to some extent, so he HAD (emphasis on the word, not shouting)<br/>
to give me something in return.   He gave me two fine steel piercing<br/>
weapons, a dexterity ring, and one other item that escapes my memory (not<br/>
anything really valuable).  Bad trade on my part?  Probably.  Am I worried<br/>
about it?  Nope.  Another of my characters has been looting Gnome guard<br/>
corpses, so that 35pp I could have gotten for the pelt has made it into my<br/>
grubby little hands just the same.  <br/>
<br/>
It all works out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

(emphasis on the word as well as shouting that time &lt;g&gt; I mean really, does<br/>
Evulia sound like a masculine name to you?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t belittle him just because he sold his item for a <br/>
&gt; price he liked.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; fail to understand the mentality that so many players have <br/>
&gt; that &quot;You&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fool because you sold that item for XYZ coins!&quot;  It&#39;s his <br/>
&gt; business and he<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whoa.  Talk about reading more into a message that the author<br/>
&gt; intended.  I never said he was a fool.  I said the buyer was<br/>
&gt; probably laughing all the way to the bank because he knew he&#39;d<br/>
&gt; taken advantage of him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; had his reasons.  Picking on him is just going to make him <br/>
&gt; feel put upon and<br/>
&gt; &gt; put down on.  He chose to do it, it&#39;s over.  He knows he <br/>
&gt; could have made<br/>
&gt; &gt; more money.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Picking on him about it really is out of line.  Especially <br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; each of us, at one time or another, has made a stupid sale <br/>
&gt; or trade.   I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not picking on him.  I&#39;m confirming that the true value of<br/>
&gt; these things is in the 25-35pp range.  I don&#39;t care what he<br/>
&gt; chooses to do with that knowledge.  I just wanted to be sure<br/>
&gt; he knew the true value, because I hate jerks who take<br/>
&gt; advantage of newbies ignorant about prices.<br/>
