<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117019957">Of course thier your opinions, I don&#39;t think anyone on any message system states facts without stating<br/>
that it is one =)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just the fact that I am not a newbie. Been around long enough to have the mentality that a<br/>
warrior item goes to the warrior instead of &quot;Rolling&quot; for it. =)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably why I get confused at the &quot;Price check&quot; phenomena that has just recently (Last week or<br/>
two) started on my server.<br/>
<br/>
You stated a few reasons to prices... There is one more...<br/>
<br/>
Can the thing that drops it be soloed by the person that is interested....<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the market for a Necklace of superiority on my server. I have Kunark, but my computer<br/>
freezes there. So I have been trying to trade for one. Only to turn away 15 offers to date because I could<br/>
solo the monster that drops it. (At least when I compare myself to others of the same calibur of playing<br/>
as myself.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I sounded like I was stating facts in my post. I did not mean to insinuate that all price guides<br/>
are invalid. Just that my opinion of them are really really low. As soon as someone I am trading with<br/>
mentions that XXX website lists thier trade item at XXX price, I tell them that I will not bother to<br/>
acknowledge that price.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I understand what you&#39;re saying, but aren&#39;t the people saying &quot;Price Check<br/>
&gt; on a XXXX!!!!&quot; asking around on their server?  They&#39;re doing what you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; suggesting.  Also, if you notice the reasoning (after the approximate prices<br/>
&gt; I listed) took into consideration some of the &quot;Are you happy&quot; type of<br/>
&gt; questions you asked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said, I do understand the concept and the flaws in the &quot;priceguide&quot;<br/>
&gt; system, and you can peruse the actual bids and weed out the obvious fakes.<br/>
&gt; I do not believe that the priceguides are THE price for any item.  But, I<br/>
&gt; know that Xegony is one of the original servers, thus sharing more similar<br/>
&gt; economies to more servers than any that came later.  Starting with this<br/>
&gt; price as a guideline is a safe bet.  It was a little easier pre-Kunark to<br/>
&gt; ask around the server as the items had been around for awhile and more<br/>
&gt; people knew their approximate value.  With all the new items from RoK, it<br/>
&gt; makes it much more difficult to even know WHAT exists out there, much less<br/>
&gt; know the value for it.  I am surprised constantly by the new items I loot<br/>
&gt; and have to consider whether the item is a &quot;cash item&quot; or a trade item.  And<br/>
&gt; people I ask many times have no clue to the price and actually ask me the<br/>
&gt; stats! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are several things that establish a price.  Obviously Supply and<br/>
&gt; Demand are the biggest.  How badly somebody wants an item is a 3rd.  A high<br/>
&gt; end Ranger Only sword would go for more than a Bard Only sword with the<br/>
&gt; exact same stats.  Why?  There are more rangers than bards.  If both those<br/>
&gt; same items were pre-Kunark they&#39;d go for less on an aged server than a new<br/>
&gt; server.  Why?  There are more items in population.  If you look closely and<br/>
&gt; consider the flaws, the pricing guides all take this into consideration<br/>
&gt; obviously as these are (hopefully) REAL trades.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with the other statement someone made about buying a car... I would<br/>
&gt; always check priceguides and alternatives first... I may be happy with the<br/>
&gt; price, but I would sure be pissed off to find out after it was too late that<br/>
&gt; I was ripped off.  Even if I could afford the payments and they didn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; to high at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve used the priceguides as just that, guides, for a long time now, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had lots of success with it.  I&#39;ve had people send me tells saying,<br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;ll never get 30k in trade value for an Arbitor&#39;s Longsword&quot;... I laugh<br/>
&gt; to myself and tell them, &quot;Okay&quot; and proceed with dealing with the person<br/>
&gt; offering that or more.  If there is no person offering that or more, then I<br/>
&gt; obviously would lower my standard, but what they&#39;re telling me is THEY would<br/>
&gt; not pay that for the item.  That&#39;s perfectly fine... I&#39;ll trade it to<br/>
&gt; someone else. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the Selo&#39;s Drum... I&#39;d more than likely use my tambourine and try<br/>
&gt; to loot the selo&#39;s drum than trade 15k in value for it... But, I&#39;d be ALOT<br/>
&gt; more open to trading 15k in value for it if I knew that it was a typical<br/>
&gt; price and I wasn&#39;t being ripped off.  It&#39;s on my list of WANTS, but there<br/>
&gt; are many items on that list and I only have a limited &quot;budget&quot; to work with.<br/>
&gt; :)  I will probably only see ONE Arbitor&#39;s Longsword in my Bardic life... I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to throw it away for JUST Singing Steel Gaunts, even tho I<br/>
&gt; really, no REALLY want them. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; btw, in case anyone doesn&#39;t know ~ means &quot;approximately&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, these are just my opinions, I don&#39;t presume to think that everyone<br/>
&gt; or &quot;anyone&quot; shares them, but I do know there is reasoning behind them. :)<br/>
&gt; YMMV<br/>

&gt; &gt; No offense but all those sites out there with &quot;Priceguides&quot; are worthless.<br/>
&gt; If you want to get an idea what<br/>
&gt; &gt; something is worth. You MUST only ask around on your server. Other servers<br/>
&gt; vary wildly in pricing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those websites get the children posting prices of 250 plat for a item that<br/>
&gt; goes 10K+ on every other<br/>
&gt; &gt; server. Throws off the pricing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The way to know that you are getting a good deal?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ask yourself one question. Are you happy with what you are getting?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I always wondered about this new phenomenon on my server called &quot;Price<br/>
&gt; Check on a XXX!!!!!&quot;. It inundates<br/>
&gt; &gt; the chat channels whenever there is a single auction. Now I know the<br/>
&gt; reason, it&#39;s sites like this one with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;Price&quot; of items on it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You ask later in your post about the value of a Selo&#39;s drum. I refer you<br/>
&gt; to the question above. Are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy with what you are paying for it?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Swarmcaller is one of the top Ranger only 2HS weapons in the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My sources ( www.maximumeq.com ) say it&#39;s worth ~20k.  Those same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sources say the Jade Mace is worth ~12k.  Face value says, no it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a good trade. :)  But, consider the Jade Mace is the best Bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wieldable 1HB weapon in the game AND has better dam/delay ratio than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Symphonic Saber and Harmonic Dagger (without the proc).  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; off. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :)<br/>
