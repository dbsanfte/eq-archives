&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be interested in seeing the results of a caster<br/>
&gt; and a bard racing from Freeport to Qeynos and back.<br/>
&gt; I can see it now. Caster pays 1pp for SOW and nearly<br/>
&gt; keeps up with bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since the Caster can pay someone else to help him, then I will pay someone<br/>
to help me.  &quot;/auction Need a group gate to Qeynos&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bard arrives in Qeynos let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; be generous and say 10 minutes before wizard does.<br/>
&gt; Bard heads back and gleefully waves at wizard still<br/>
&gt; on his way to Qeynos. Wizard gets to Qeynos. Wizard<br/>
&gt; gates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>
&gt; while the bard is still running.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the race was serious, the bard could just suicide against a guard and be<br/>
instantly teleported right back to Freeport, beating the wizard.  Put all<br/>
your stuff in the bank first to make it easier.  And if you are worried<br/>
about the experience loss, kill yourself instead.  No exp loss there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>
&gt; the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>
&gt; his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>
&gt; to Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport. Bard arrives in West<br/>
&gt; Commons on his way to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, Selo&#39;s makes up for all of that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But a wizard will never be able to heal himself.  If you think Selo is the<br/>
only thing bards have going for them.....<br/>
