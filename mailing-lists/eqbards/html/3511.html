&gt; I agree with you that it is a matter of balance, but I think it should go<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; other way. I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to<br/>
&gt; cities. If<br/>
&gt; everyone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; of the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; is about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of<br/>
&gt; this it<br/>
&gt; is rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; outside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>

&gt; &gt; SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; long it takes.  Bind definitely affects where you can adventure.  Ever<br/>
&gt; seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone in Upper Guk who the mobs weren&#39;t all green to?  You can bet they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were either an evil race or a caster.  Its a five zone run for any<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-caster good race, far too dangerous, untill nearly everything in Guk<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; green to you.  Believe me I will never play another character who does<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.  I left Erudin with very<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; exploration because there was literally no one there who could bind me,<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the city!  I&#39;ve likewise had to wait over an hour just to get bound<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kaladim because there was no one around who could bind me.  Of course<br/>
&gt; had I<br/>
&gt; &gt; been a caster I was certainly high enough, 14th level to bind myself<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt; &gt; times.  I went to Guk, looked around and left.  Its too far to run when<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything around will cause a train and give no xp, except for a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; critters in the interior who are red.  If I was even a 12th level mage<br/>
&gt; type<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would have stayed since the run would be measured in seconds, not half<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours.  Pure and simple, on average one death in Guk would take up my<br/>
&gt; entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; evening of gaming and as a bard I run as fast as anyone.  That is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; imbalance, not a class distinction.<br/>
