<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078849009">I have to agree -- uberguild stuff is a sad shadow of earlier gaming.  While I am glad to have my melodic charm, my Nature&#39;s Melody and all that, I find the game just doesn&#39;t add up the same as being lvl 20 grouping with friends in LoIO.  Friendships built in this game do outstrip the benefits of phat lewt.<br/>
