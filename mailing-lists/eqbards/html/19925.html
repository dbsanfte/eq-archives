<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-850518170">Well, I hate to sound like a hard ass but, it has always been said since<br/>
day one that test is not a live server and be aware that your toon could<br/>
always be wiped.  Anyone playing on there agreed to that.  People are<br/>
supposed to be there to test the new patches, zones, items . . . what ever.<br/>
 Not to &quot;play&quot; like people on the live servers do.  Anyone on test should<br/>
have seen that it would one day come down to a p-wipe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>
&gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>
&gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>
&gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;heard. </span></blockquote></div>
