<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711039014">He is the same Trak, but the situation makes him easier.  1:  He is<br/>
completly unbuffed.  2: You have cleared out his lair, so there is no chance<br/>
for adds. I have heard that he drops 1 BP, but since my guild has no white<br/>
scales I have never been privy to guild chat when he died.  (I have been<br/>
there to kill the bard Trak twice).<br/>
