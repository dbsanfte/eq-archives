For an even more frightening study, do a survey of the types of remarks real<br/>
women get in tells while playing this game.  While I know there are any<br/>
number of &quot;normal&quot; men playing this game (at least I hope).. there is a<br/>
disturbing number of men with absolutely NO idea of how to interact socially<br/>
with women.  Frightening.  And yes, I am prepared for the flames from the<br/>
overgeneralized, stereotyping remark I have just made.  Someday though, I<br/>
will have to compile my screenshots for some amusement!<br/>

Okee - so EQ caters to men by selling them the idea that playing EQ makes<br/>
them more attractive to women & makes them more masculine. Therefore,<br/>
enhancing their social & sexual prowess.<br/>
<br/>
Great! I am a 44 year old mother of 2 teenagers - single - well-rounded<br/>
(figure wise) - semi-computer literate.<br/>
<br/>
Why was I drawn to EQ? Let&#39;s see the unconscious desire to be Firiona Vie?<br/>
To seduce young male wood elves & enslave them as my personal sex slaves?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, right. Obviously it is the author of this article that has some<br/>
suppressed sexual/masculine issues that need to be addressed.<br/>
