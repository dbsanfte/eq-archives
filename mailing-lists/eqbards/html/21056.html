 I too have been around, just not as much. Summer is just the busy season<br/>
for RL. I&#39;m on a new job and house hunting so play time is down to one or 2<br/>
times a week. I&#39;ve gotten one bubble or so on 52 so far. I did finally get a<br/>
sharkskin drum a month ago, one of those &#39;I can&#39;t believe it spawned!&#39; days.<br/>
Several of my normal higher level group mates have been off alot as well, so<br/>
my wiz is finally gaining ground, up to 27 as of last night.<br/>
 I&#39;m currently looking at upgrade paths for my PC. I figure the new<br/>
expansion will kill my current machine since Kunark trees bog it down now. <br/>
<br/>
Now a question: Was Selo&#39;s Song of Travel intended for a high mortality rate<br/>
among group members or is that just a bonus? I think I have killed everyone<br/>
I know running across Dreadlands at least once.<br/>
