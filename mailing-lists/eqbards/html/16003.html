<br/>
The ONLY reason that I even became addicted to computer games was a<br/>
first-person perspective.  I&#39;m now 36 years old and I NEVER got interested<br/>
in computer games until I downloaded the shareware version of Wolfenstein<br/>
3D.  Then I was hooked and moved on to Doom, Doom II, Quake, Unreal, Quake<br/>
II, Half-Life, Quake III Arena, EverQuest.<br/>
<br/>
My suspension of disbelief falls away if it&#39;s not First-Person, and for me<br/>
the game is no longer fun.<br/>

&gt; I picked it up last weekend when it was $25 at Best Buy.  To answer the<br/>
&gt; recent question: yes, you get a free month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; fixed, why<br/>
&gt; &gt;it was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The detail in the update reports did impress me quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most verything else you pointed out was pretty nice, too (landscape<br/>
&gt; graphics, dynamic world, skill sets, less paranoia of players<br/>
&gt; advancing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the character appearance, though, I have to agree with another post I<br/>
&gt; saw somewhere: it&#39;s a nice idea, but you rarely ever see people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; faces, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a lot of design effort gone (mostly) to waste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>
&gt; &gt;reported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; &gt;single bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, this is what killed it for me:<br/>
&gt;  - no secure trading (did they never play Diablo?  how long ago was that?)<br/>
&gt;  - no banking (everything is on your person, or on player named<br/>
&gt; &quot;Will&#39;s Mule&quot;)<br/>
&gt;  - the first-person mouselook is entirely unusable.  There&#39;s no mouse<br/>
&gt;    acceleration setting, and the horiz and vertical are fixed at entirely<br/>
&gt;    different settings, so turning is slow, but your head keeps snapping up<br/>
&gt;    to the sky or down to the ground.  Then, if you move forward and try to<br/>
&gt;    turn while running forward, it _stops_ and does the turn, and you have<br/>
&gt;    to press &#39;forward&#39; again.  Entirely, utterly, unusable.  You have to<br/>
&gt;    play the game third-person, with the keyboard, which completely kills<br/>
&gt;    any immersion factor for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I&#39;m not entirely convinced on the better support from listening to<br/>
&gt; players; I&#39;m sure these have been reported over and over since the beta<br/>
&gt; started, and are pretty major design flaws IMHO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other things I&#39;ve heard about but didn&#39;t get far enough to see:<br/>
&gt;  - no group health display<br/>
&gt;  - unbalanced heavily towards magic and archers, and against melee<br/>
&gt;  - no guards, so people can have fun pulling monsters into the town square </span></blockquote></div>
