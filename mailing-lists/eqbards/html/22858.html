<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259741029">Wonder if it would be worth our effort to try and convince Verant one last<br/>
time to change the way the game works and have our haste songs stack with<br/>
Enchanter and Shaman haste buffs?  It may end up being wasted effort, but if<br/>
the bard community can come up with solid reasoning as to why they should<br/>
stack then perhaps we can get enough support from the rest of the EQ<br/>
community that Verant will reconsider.  This would be a change that benefits<br/>
every class without nerfing enchanters and shamans.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to Berserker (42 song), is there anyone out there besides me who<br/>
thinks the haste bonus of this song is screwed up?  Celerity at 36 gives you<br/>
a 20% bonus while Verses of Victory at 50 gives you 30%.  Since Berserker is<br/>
in between these two songs, doesn&#39;t it seem like the haste bonus should be<br/>
25% instead of 17%.  Also, Berserker is the only haste song pre-50 that is<br/>
enchanced with an instrument (brass).  Anthem, Celerity and Verses are all<br/>
singing only.  So shouldn&#39;t the haste bonus of Berserker be increased when<br/>
you equip an instrument? The STR and AC bonus for using a brass instrument<br/>
with Berserker is double.  So at a minimum, the haste bonus should be 34%.<br/>
