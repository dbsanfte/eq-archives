<b>Subject:</b> Re: dropping LORE items in containers (was something else) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405323035">If you drop a container on the ground, any LORE items inside the<br/>
container will poof.  Not just sometimes, but all the time.  I learned<br/>
this the hard way when my sister handed me a Paw of Oppalla and asked<br/>
me to identify the ring inside (which she knew was a waste of time<br/>
anyway).  I didn&#39;t have a spare inventory slot and the paw fell on the<br/>
ground.  When I picked it up, no ring.  I petitioned and the guide I<br/>
talked to responded basically, &quot;You should have known that would<br/>
happen,&quot; and &quot;No, I can&#39;t restore the item.&quot;<br/>
