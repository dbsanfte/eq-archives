Metal Music:  You say, &#39;hail Vhalen Nostrolo&#39;.  Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;Nice<br/>
to meet you.  Do not the plains of Karana whistle with life.  This land is<br/>
truly blessed by the gods.  Would you like to hear a tune or do you pass?<br/>
You say, &#39;I would like to hear a tune.&#39; Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;Inside this<br/>
heart I am trapped with the sight beautiful colors, all memories of your<br/>
love They attack me with fullmight .  You left me here in this garden of<br/>
grey Never to see the true colors of the happiness of day Here in my heart I<br/>
sit and I cry  You have left me alone and my colors have all died .  What do<br/>
you think? Is it a happy tune or a sad tune? You say, &#39;A sad tune, I think.&#39;<br/>
Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;It takes a broken heart to truly appreciate that tune.<br/>
I am glad you enjoyed it. My dear Metala left me one year ago. The wound has<br/>
healed , but the scar lives on. I am presently trying to complete a New<br/>
Composition. Maybe that will turn me around.  You say, &#39;Where is Metala?&#39;<br/>
Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;My dear sweet Metala Highflit. She was a bard I<br/>
trained and fell in love with. We were perfect together. We composed many<br/>
love ballads during those years. I just love the way she used to brush the<br/>
hair away from he=r face and to see her in the moonlight brought daylight to<br/>
my soul . We had such times ! I remember once we had dinner at the lion&#39;s<br/>
Mane and we ordered a burrow pie for desert and she got some whipped cream<br/>
on her nose ! Oh it was so cute.. Am I boring <br/>
you or should I tell you where it went wrong?  You say, &#39;Tell me where it<br/>
went wrong.&#39;  Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;It was like that for years and then it<br/>
all just ended. She began to hang around some man called Garuc Anehm. She<br/>
started <br/>
attending evening functions. She said it was choir practice for the Temple<br/>
of Life. Do you want to know what I found out or am I boring you?   You say,<br/>
&#39;What did you find out?&#39; Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;Feeling neglected, I also<br/>
went to join the choir. To my shock I learned from High Priestess Jahnda<br/>
that Metala never was in the choir. When I mentioned that fellow Garuc&#39;s<br/>
name she gave me a dirty look and could talk no further.  Must be boring<br/>
you. You don&#39;t want to hear the end.  You say, &#39;I want to hear the end.&#39;<br/>
Vhalen Nostrolo says &#39;I went home to confront Metala.  All I found was an<br/>
empty house and a note. &#39;Sorry to leave. Thank you for all you have taught<br/>
me. My new friends have showed me new paths of pain. My music shall sing for<br/>
a new generation of bard. Goodbye.&#39; I never saw her again. What ever she has<br/>
started is twisted and contorted. It is not the music of the soul. She must<br/>
surely be stopped before it is too late.  Please go. I do not feel like<br/>
talking any further of this.   I am not sure where you find Metala, or where<br/>
this goes, if anywhere (it might just be a statement against Heavy Metal<br/>
Music by the writer).  However, I have been told, but cannot confirm, that<br/>
Metala has been spotted in Mistmoore. (Submitted by Khallin Spiritcaller)</div>
