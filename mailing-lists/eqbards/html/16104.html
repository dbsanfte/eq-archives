<div id="ygrps-yiv-746105738"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Harmonic - I have a hard time disagreeing with anything you&#39;ve posted here.<br/>
&gt; I do remain hopeful that you&#39;re wrong; and the expansion will come out and<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll have a bunch of cool new songs; that they for the most part work.  I<br/>
&gt; also hope that they fix Lullaby - and get the other missing songs (that they<br/>
&gt; said would be out with the expansion)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s the thing.  I hope I&#39;m wrong too.  I&#39;m tired of being let down.<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s a lot of potential here in this game.  During my time away I<br/>
  got to take another look at the game outside of the shell.  While I<br/>
  still dislike AC, I got to play a lot of other games like Nox, Majesty,<br/>
  The Sims, etc.  I almost beat Nox in one day, Majesty is pretty cool,<br/>
  and The Sims only hold my attention for so long.  Anyway, I got to <br/>
  appreciate player interaction more by playing so many single player<br/>
  games.  I&#39;ve said it before, this game used to be cool graphics, neat<br/>
  effects, awesome weapons/armor, strategy based, exploring...  now it&#39;s<br/>
  purely friendships.  There&#39;s no magic to the game beyond that any more.<br/>
  I don&#39;t look at Everquest and become amazed like I used to which is<br/>
  fine, I&#39;ve made up for Verant&#39;s lack of enthusiasm by forming online<br/>
  bonds with people.  If we don&#39;t get the right songs, or even decent<br/>
  songs that have been tested, I&#39;ll still get to explore and learn new<br/>
  things about the expansion.  Once that novelity has worn off, I&#39;ll <br/>
  be looking hard at why Verant chooses to undercut certain classes on a<br/>
  consistant basis (most particularly bards).  <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t feel we are keeping balanced with other classes, but<br/>
  until we claim that - Verant will not see a problem.  Everquest is <br/>
  turning toward a cleric + warrior game, strategies/abilities/spells or<br/>
  songs are really not meaningful in that scenario.  When a group of<br/>
  people hunting gods, dragons, etc can say &#39;We really don&#39;t need a bard<br/>
  for this.&#39;, &#39;We need better tanks, and better healing, bards will just<br/>
  lag us.&#39;, &#39;I would rather have a warrior with decent gear instead of a<br/>
  bard.&#39; - something is seriously wrong balance-wise.<br/>
<br/>
  To address the original point, we&#39;ll get the songs but will they <br/>
  be well thought out, that remains to be seen.  I am hopeful, but<br/>
  doubtful (as I said before).<br/>
