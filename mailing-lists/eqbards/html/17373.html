<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115126618">I&#39;m with you on the EULA.  I sent out an email to my regular group that<br/>
they won&#39;t be seeing me this Thurs.  They&#39;re not happy to say the least,<br/>
I&#39;m the only healer in the group.<br/>
<br/>
As for STA bonused, my roomate is a 21 warrior, I will have him check<br/>
the effect of +4 sta (from 2 earrings), When last he checked it was as<br/>
bad as my cleric&#39;s bonus. I really think STA is another pretty useless<br/>
stat in the game...<br/>
