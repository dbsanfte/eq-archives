<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525897153">By and large, most people are afraid to go to kunark due to binding and<br/>
traveling issues.<br/>
<br/>
Experience in kunark dungeons is nothing short of amazing. We went to<br/>
Kaesora the last 3 nights. In 2 hours camping the Church area, I made 1.5<br/>
bubbles in level 44. We got a total 5 ransacker packs, and Xalgoz himself<br/>
spawned once, dropping the fang. The library area is awesome for levels<br/>
35-40 as everything is still blue. The drops are less frequent there but exp<br/>
is still great.<br/>
<br/>
This is also a great dungeon for crawling. You can get most mobs as single<br/>
or double pulls. There are many wanderers, but they are easy to isolate and<br/>
pick off. There are well spaced areas where you can pause to clear the next<br/>
area. And the spawn clock is enough so that you can clear an area and the<br/>
next area before respawn.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend Kaesora for parties levels 35-45. In the time I&#39;ve spent<br/>
there, I&#39;ve only once, seen someone not in my group in the dungeon.<br/>
