<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000866748">First, welcome to being a bard.  We are the best and most friendly class in<br/>
the game (don&#39;t tell anyone).<br/>
<br/>
The AC benefit of bronze over banded was never justifiable to me considering<br/>
the weight, so I was in banded until I bought steel one piece at a time.<br/>
From steel I started accumulating the Lambent pieces, a full set of which is<br/>
very well rounded stat-wise.  Stay with your bronze if you&#39;re happy until<br/>
you start getting Lambent.  Since you have the bronze you might as well skip<br/>
over Steel as it&#39;s quite expensive (Breastplate was ~850pp as I recall).<br/>
However, the one saving grace of buying steel is that you basically rent it.<br/>
The sell-back price of steel plate is quite high (75%?), so much of your<br/>
investment is recouped as you replace those pieces with Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
For weapons I would recommend a Polished Granite Tomahawk or Barbed Leather<br/>
Whip in your primary hand and Dragoon Dirk in your offhand (when you hit 17<br/>
and get duel wield that is).  The benefit of these two weapons is that they<br/>
work on two separate skills (1 hand slash and piercing) simultaneously as<br/>
you level.  When you can afford it buy a Staff of Writhing (~400pp), bite<br/>
the bullet and work your 1 hand blunt skill up.  As you mature and replace<br/>
the Dragoon Dirk with a better weapon (although it&#39;s awfully good for the<br/>
level that it&#39;s available - you&#39;ll use it a while), you can move it to your<br/>
range (throwing) slot and retain its stat bonuses.  So the Dirk remains<br/>
useful even after you stop wielding it in your hand and thus amortizes your<br/>
expenditure even further over time.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>
&gt; could reccomend a 1h slash weapon for a level 12 bard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I am in bronze armor now for the most part..and it seems a bit<br/>
&gt; heavy.  Whats the next step armor wise?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks! </span></blockquote></div>
