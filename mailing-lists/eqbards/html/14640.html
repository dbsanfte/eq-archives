<div id="ygrps-yiv-396186744">OK I thought Sylly made the original post that included the timeline with<br/>
all the /who Sylly entries in it. Didn&#39;t realize it was from you Harm.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; OK the reason may be obvious but have gone right over my head, but why<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; you do a /who sylly on yourself?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   actually, I just do:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   /who friends all<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   but then I&#39;d have to explain that Sylly is on my friends list.<br/>
&gt;   So I cut it short and typed:  /who sylly (implied all)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I just checked to see which friends were online by doing that.<br/>
