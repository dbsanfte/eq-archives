&gt; Yup it works quite well, be a bit careful with weapons as humanoid types<br/>
&gt; (orcs, skeletons, etc) will wield those weapons as well.  Of course it would<br/>
&gt; be kinda funny to see a skeleton with a BIBS :)<br/>

Rivervale... The Banquer was nice with his Scythe in hand...<br/>

&quot;Signs on the freeway are funny. They have a sign that says, &#39;Orange Cones Mean<br/>
Men at Work.&#39; What else could orange cones mean? Psychedelic witches embedded in<br/>
asphalt?&quot;<br/>
