<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261649383">What is the going rate for crookstinger?  Someone was trying to get me to<br/>
purchase one for 300pp, which seemed excessive for something I wanted mearly<br/>
as a novety item.  Can anyone confirm the stats to be 4 dam/21 delay/proc:<br/>
weak poison?  The seller was advertizing it to be proc: poison.  Big<br/>
difference there, but I still don&#39;t think it warrents 300 pp. :)<br/>
<br/>
Now for the and... part: how do you guys handle poiletly exiting a group?<br/>
If I can&#39;t get together with my normal crew/guild then I do like everyone<br/>
else and join up with whoever is around.  Sometimes this works wonderously<br/>
and I add the best to my friends list for later, but most of the time its<br/>
just so-so.  This I can handle, its part of the game.  Rarely however, you<br/>
join up with a completely backwards group and you know you&#39;re either going<br/>
to die or things are going to be horrifically slow.  I always have a<br/>
difficult time leaving on poliet terms (since I really DON&#39;T want to just<br/>
say &quot;You guys are gonna get me killed, I&#39;m outta here.&quot; or, &quot;You guys don&#39;t<br/>
know how to play and refuse to listen to my suggestions.&quot;) but...<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with the previous statment that bards make excellent battle<br/>
field commanders; for some reason we (this list at any rate) have invested<br/>
the time to learn how to make the peices work well together insofar as<br/>
learning other classes&#39; roles in the fray.  Twisting songs can be a chore at<br/>
time, but I have temedous fun with song selection, trying new song orders,<br/>
etc.  I feel above the fight in a lot of ways even if I&#39;m throwing punches<br/>
or swinging a sword.  I hate to tell someone how to play their character but<br/>
when you hear a 20th level warrior in oasis saying &quot;My taunt&#39;s at 15, I<br/>
never use it.&quot; or seeing the enchanter wade into the melee while trying to<br/>
cast you feel compelled to say something if for nothing else than self<br/>
preservation.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s on Veeshan, feel free to give me a tell, I&#39;m always up to<br/>
something!<br/>
