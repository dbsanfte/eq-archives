<div id="ygrps-yiv-150763727">The original poster was using your second method (and missed the box I assume).<br/>
I was just suggesting going slow until you get the hang of hitting the box<br/>
everytime and how to find something when you DO drop it.<br/>

There is a better way to do this!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When in battle I set up one page of quick buttons to be inventory and<br/>
melee spots<br/>
a quick Shift 2 - and the melee and open inventory spots are all right<br/>
there close to each other - switching is fast<br/>
Then Shift 1 back to my bank of song quick buttons<br/>
<br/>
Warning - you can still drop items if you miss these boxes, but its<br/>
harder to do that than dropping from your inventory screen.<br/>
<br/>
This is much faster than going to inventory and moving the mouse as<br/>
much as you need to for the juggle.<br/>
