<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360211598">i talked to two ppl (one on bertox and another on e&#39;ci) who&#39;d been on a<br/>
nagafen raid recently.  they said nagafen was no different than usual that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I only say consensus is that Nagafen was upgraded because<br/>
&gt; several guilds who used to be able to kill him on Karana were<br/>
&gt; unable to despite multiple attempts, and the two guilds we<br/>
&gt; expected would have no problems needed two attempts. </span></blockquote></div>
