<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738499981">Here&#39;s another question for our 50th level bard friend.  Is twisting a<br/>
requirement, can you possible get to 50th level without twisting.  A) I<br/>
think twisting might be a slight exploit (Not that I get mad if anyone else<br/>
does it), B) the messages that bards spam in the chat window gets so<br/>
annoying, and hard to read, I miss a lot of important messages from friends<br/>
and party members.<br/>
<br/>
I find it best just to pick the song that best suits what you are doing, and<br/>
leave it there until something else is needed.<br/>

&gt; Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye twitch speed.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem with having<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>
&gt; twitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having to think in<br/>
&gt; battle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch to keep up 2<br/>
&gt; buffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a buff/Selo when<br/>
&gt; travelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying melee.  So while<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; other casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get to rest while<br/>
&gt; the party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>
&gt; expectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard managing to twist<br/>
&gt; continously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if I&#39;m wrong ..<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; this is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, trackball mouse<br/>
&gt; & pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild coordination<br/>
&gt; problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>
&gt; person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little surprised by<br/>
&gt; the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with hot keys<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;a battle!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, such as played<br/>
&gt; &gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During combat, while<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an eye everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then return to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own damage spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing.  And you get<br/>
&gt; &gt;to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>
