<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350627844"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ooo! What levels is it good for exactly? Like mid 30s?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went there at 30 and I&#39;m within a bubble of hitting 35 tonight.  I&#39;m a<br/>
casual player (couple of hours a night at most) and have been there for<br/>
about 3 weeks now. Like you, I had been in Frontier Mountains doing the<br/>
giants, but it was quickly becoming FarmQuest, with everyone after Loops.<br/>
Dalnir (on my server at least) has less than 20 people in the zone at peak<br/>
times - you&#39;ll find mostly casters and monks there.  Casters because of<br/>
their self-bind and monks because there&#39;s some nice loot for them.<br/>
<br/>
The first floor is good for high 20&#39;s (at a push) to 33 or so.  I&#39;d stay<br/>
there for now until you find a regular group you&#39;re comfortable with... that<br/>
first trip down to the 2nd level can be a bit daunting.  On the first floor<br/>
you&#39;ll find Ravenous Nibblers (pure melee), Gyrating Goo (melee but have a<br/>
strong poison DoT) and various Coerced beasties such as Gnomes, Goblins,<br/>
Iksar, Erudite, Tier&#39;Dal and Dwarves.  Most of them are casters, so have<br/>
Rhythms handy or get interrupting them with Pixie Strike.<br/>
<br/>
The second floor is an absolute joy from 32-37.  I&#39;m 34 and everything still<br/>
cons blue.  I&#39;ve been grouping with a 38 necro and most of the Kly (Sarnaks)<br/>
were still blue to her.  There&#39;s some excellent loot to be had there too,<br/>
but I&#39;m all about the exp right now. :)  Notable beasties are the Imprecator<br/>
himself (he drops one of the Ancient Coins for the Tambourine quest), and<br/>
Lumpy Goo (who drop Graven Sandals and Fighting Batons).  The Imprecator<br/>
room is an absolute blast once you break that spawn cycle.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note about Dalnir is the non-aggro mobs.  Some of the Nibblers<br/>
and Goo will happily let you stroll past.  It helps to learn which ones and<br/>
where are non-aggro.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend getting a good map of the place - try Allakhazam&#39;s for some<br/>
links.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
