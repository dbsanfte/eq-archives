<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210348471">Our biggest problem in Sol A was like Guk it really requires your group to<br/>
include a ranger if your bard doesn&#39;t have chains yet.  Roots just weren&#39;t<br/>
enough to keep the gobbies from fleeing and causing trains as trying to kill<br/>
the rooted goblins usually ended up freeing them too quickly.  If the &#39;real&#39;<br/>
reason they made Acellerando not work indoors because of trains, why don&#39;t<br/>
the goblins get changed so they don&#39;t cause trains?  One bad party causes<br/>
far more trains than a bard with Acellerando ever would.  Anyhow, from my<br/>
experience no ranger = no Sol A or Guk until your bard is 23rd minimum.<br/>

&gt; There is a ton of stuff out there in the L20-40 range that<br/>
&gt; most people don&#39;t fight, either out of ignorance or fear.  If<br/>
&gt; I knew then what I know now, I would&#39;ve been making about half<br/>
&gt; a level per night.  Heck, I took what I learned about<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore, set up my L30-40 friends inside the castle, and<br/>
&gt; they were making 3-4 bubbles a night.<br/>

When I leveled my druid on Tribunal I made a point of mainly going<br/>
places I missed the first time around. It requires a lot more together<br/>
group to do Perma, Guk and Sol A for experience than most first time<br/>
characters probably have, but it definately can be done.<br/>
