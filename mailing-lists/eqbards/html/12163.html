 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not just you.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever do that, except to test out<br/>
charm when (if) I get it. Mind you, I&#39;m not really partial to dungeons, but<br/>
unfortunately a lot of lambent quest items are in them so I guess I&#39;d better<br/>
start liking them. :)<br/>
