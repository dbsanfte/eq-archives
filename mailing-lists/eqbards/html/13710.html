&gt;   No, thats not it.  The monster table that Verant uses says<br/>
&gt;   that a DW goblin will drop a helm X % of the time.  Because you<br/>
&gt;   happened to get a helm 1 out of 5, doesnt mean the next time a<br/>
&gt;   helm did drop it wouldn&#39;t have come maybe on the 20th one?  I got<br/>
&gt;   my helm on the first DW goblin I killed.  It took me well over<br/>
&gt;   20 griffennes to get a charm the first time.  The second time I got it<br/>
&gt;   on the third try.  It&#39;s the way statistics work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We were there all last night - we were killing them for the<br/>
exp and to try something different.  That the bards needed the<br/>
helms for the lambent quest was just incidental.  Like I said,<br/>
we got 9 helms (maybe more - I left for a half hour to deliver<br/>
some items), so it&#39;s not a sample of one or two.<br/>
<br/>
Of course they didn&#39;t come at regular intervals.  The 3rd<br/>
goblin we killed had one, then we had to kill about a dozen<br/>
more before we got another, then after about 5 more, we got 3<br/>
in a row and a fourth soon after.  But overall, it was about 1<br/>
in 5.<br/>
