<div id="ygrps-yiv-612182592"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;      If you ever get a black pearl or a diamond as loot DON&#39;T <br/>
&gt; sell them!<br/>
&gt;       <br/>
&gt;      Save them till you find a good jeweler and commission <br/>
&gt; him/her to make  <br/>
&gt;      jewelry for you.  Those two gems are tops as far as I <br/>
&gt; can tell and are  <br/>
&gt;      only available as loot.  Most gems can be bought from <br/>
&gt; vendors but not  <br/>
&gt;      the very best ones.  Black pearls add to both str and <br/>
&gt; dex and diamonds  <br/>
&gt;      add to 4 different things!   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, assuming I ever find myself fingering a black pearl in my pocket &<br/>
negotiating a price with some jeweler, any recommendations for how to cover<br/>
myself in case a) the jeweler fails, or b) the jeweler claims they failed,<br/>
or c) the jeweler laughs, says &quot;Sucker!&quot; and starts to run away?  This is<br/>
assuming I&#39;m not on a PvP server and can&#39;t kill him or her.<br/>
