Before I start I&#39;d like to say, Yes I did sorta steal this from Tweety, but<br/>
I could never hope to match her jaw-dropping writing style and [gratuitous<br/>
flattery]<br/>
<br/>
***Care and feeding of your bard***<br/>
<br/>
-Song Selection<br/>
We all know bards have to pick the right songs for the right situations.<br/>
Fortunately for you, all of them involve singing mana song all the time. And<br/>
we all know that twisting mana song with itself actually increases mana<br/>
regen by 5% so make your bard constantly start and stop mana song during the<br/>
fight. If a bard has some other spells that involve regening mana faster<br/>
allow him to memorize those too. <br/>
<br/>
-General grouping<br/>
As soon as a bard joins the group, be sure to ask him to play mana song. He<br/>
may forget that he has to sing it, and therefore by reminding him you have<br/>
informed him how to play his class (They are very forgetful). Also make sure<br/>
he uses an instrument at all times. Doesn&#39;t matter which one, they all help<br/>
mana song work faster. Bard melee is worthless anyways. If your bard is<br/>
using weapons, inform them that they are supposed to play music not swing<br/>
swords, they were only given weapons in the beginning so that their Epic<br/>
would be more useful than just a all-encompassing instrument. Also, no bard<br/>
knows what they are doing. If you don&#39;t feel like demanding that they play<br/>
mana song, be sure to do it politely instead. Say things like &quot;Are you sure<br/>
mana song wouldn&#39;t be better than haste and resist buffing?&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ve never<br/>
played a bard before, but I know mana song would help more than anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Healing<br/>
Bards don&#39;t need to be healed. Simple as that. When a mob is beating on a<br/>
bard it is really trying to fool you into healing the bard to waste your<br/>
mana (because we all know that healing a bard is much less mana efficient<br/>
than healing a tank), thus not being able to heal the tank when the mob<br/>
cleverly switches targets back to he/she/it. Simply wait till the bard is<br/>
very low and then start the CH on the tank. By the time the mob switches to<br/>
the tank and hits them a few times you will meet your maximum mana<br/>
efficiency quota, and the bard will still be alive. You sure didn&#39;t fall for<br/>
that mobs nasty trick. Besides you can always allow your bard to stop<br/>
singing mana song long enough for him to throw in one pulse of his heal song<br/>
(only one though). He/she should be fine after that. BTW ask for bards heal<br/>
to be nerfed because a mana free heal is infinitely mana efficient and<br/>
therefore makes them better healers than a cleric/shammy/druid. Bards never<br/>
die so they dont need any kind of heal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Status reporting<br/>
Bards are notorious for slacking off during a fight. They only have to play<br/>
one song, why should they not be able to constantly respond to group chat<br/>
about how mana regen isn&#39;t &quot;quite as fast as it should be, maybe you should<br/>
be stopping the song a half second sooner&quot;. Also berate your bard for not<br/>
telling you when their charm/mez has worn off. Why are they charming/mezzing<br/>
anyways? Didn&#39;t they only have mana song memorized?<br/>
<br/>
-Bard Growth<br/>
Be sure to ask all your friends to post what they think would be best for<br/>
bards. Although you have never played a bard before, you still know what is<br/>
best for them. But never group them in with your character type. If you are<br/>
a hybrid be sure to say how powerful their songs are and therefore don&#39;t<br/>
need any melee enhancements. If you are a caster point out that they have<br/>
better melee skills than you do and therefore their songs should never be<br/>
made more powerful or useful (except mana song). Did you know they don&#39;t use<br/>
mana?????<br/>
<br/>
By following these useful steps you will ensure that your bard will make a<br/>
very useful mana battery in time. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
