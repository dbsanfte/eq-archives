&gt; Heh, ya really does depend on what you are fighting.  I have been fighting<br/>
&gt; stuff that is 50-53 (ok, me and 23 of my fiends have).  Last night my cleric<br/>
&gt; asked me to play mana song only when in melee and asked a warrior to stop<br/>
&gt; taunting (me 48 and war 47; mob 52+).  He said it was just too hard keeping<br/>
&gt; us alive.  That seemed to reduce the &#39;attention&#39; I got from the mobs while<br/>
&gt; contributing my slashes for 10 and 12.  I switched my Yk to off-hand to<br/>
&gt; *reduce* the amount of procs.  Yes, even though it getst resisted, it still<br/>

simply stop attacking and either stop weaving (if I&#39;ve just<br/>
taken several hits) or stop singing entirely (if I&#39;m in danger<br/>
of dying).  It worked great when I got knocked to a bubble<br/>
while wielding a yak and waki and weaving 3 songs.  Has worked<br/>
fine every time I get into trouble in Hate/Fear.<br/>

Vox wiped out 30+ people, including nearly my entire group I&#39;d<br/>
been buffing and healing during the fight, not to mention the<br/>
bit of melee damage I did against her, and when everyone was<br/>
dead she didn&#39;t care about me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fast one time and all she did was cast rune 3 or 4 on herself - no melee, no<br/>
&gt; nuking - just buffing and whammo!  Down she went.  In fact, she died lots<br/>
&gt; more than i did (i may have gone the whole night with either 0 or only 1<br/>
&gt; death.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wait&#39;ll Cazic or Innoruk start to death touch people.  Once<br/>
they hit someone in your party, you&#39;re almost sure to be<br/>
next.  Better yet, try being the bard in the group with the<br/>
puller.  :)<br/>
