Help me out on the Captain America bit:  blue head/chest/legs, red<br/>
wrist/boots/gloves?  Hum... shimmering orb shield or is there a better one?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d LOVE to get The Flash look going (being a bard and all), all red with<br/>
yellow boots and wrists but sadly Nameless came up after rubi was removed. <br/>
There are a few suits out there, I&#39;m working hard to scounge up the<br/>
remaining peices.<br/>
<br/>
Some times I do the road runner look as well: orange legs/boots, mith<br/>
bp/arms/wrist, lambent helm/gloves, hotkey: /say BEEP BEEP!<br/>
<br/>
Gaga... and they always wonder why I want 10 slot weightless containers. :)<br/>
