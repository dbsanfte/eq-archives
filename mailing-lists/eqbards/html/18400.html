It looks simply wicked!  It does good damage too. Used it on some raptors<br/>
(dinos not birds?? only Vernat...) in Timourous Deep.<br/>

p.s. still looking for all all arrows to give my bow a try.  spent most of<br/>
the weekend playing my ranger guy 6, cleric 11, & wiz 31 (you can exp twink<br/>
with a wizard but it aint easy! or maybe i am just a dweeb.  i took the wiz<br/>
and the cleric to the wk ghoul camp.  bound the wiz there. pulled single<br/>
ghouls and nuked it down to a sliver. gated to nk.  then the cleric was<br/>
supposed to kill the ghoul (red).  well, a sliver for 31 is not same as a<br/>
sliver for a 9.  and being red it was hard to do damage even if only a<br/>
little bit was needed.  and of course the ghoul would cast and weaken/root,<br/>
etc.  we died a couple times.  once the cleric was still bound in crushbone<br/>
zone and was trained at her bind spot. double death on that one - ugh.)<br/>
