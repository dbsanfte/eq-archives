on the dead side, where live side mobs can aggro on you.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen three live side trains, mostly stuff from the elder<br/>
room, run into the savant/executioner/cavalier area.  One<br/>
happened to a group I was in (I was leaving and saw it all run<br/>
past me, then I saw my group all die), and I assure you we<br/>
were not pulling from the live side.<br/>

A friend and I were working our way to the mino elder once<br/>
from the dead side.  We were having a close but in-hand fight<br/>
against two frogs (I was charming one) in the hall before the<br/>
room leading to the mino elder.  Somehow the elder aggroed on<br/>
me through the wall, and teleported on top of me.  Things went<br/>
downhill quick from there.<br/>
