<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540664840">Okay, I must be smoking something real good at the moment. Ring mail is<br/>
most often rings sewn onto leather adjacent to each other or sometimes<br/>
laying over the row below it. Not very often that they are actually linked<br/>
in any manner. It would still perform about the same way, though.<br/>

	Ring mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>
metal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>
and allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>
seeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>
the big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>
reduced to whatever padding is underneath.</div>
