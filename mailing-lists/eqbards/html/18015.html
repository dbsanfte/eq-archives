<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075225083">Hehehe - what is it about Highkeep that attracts dumb bards?  Back when I<br/>
was hunting there - I got into a big argument with about Jig and Mana Regen.<br/>
And this was RIGHT after GZ posted the note that Jig.  I pointed that out to<br/>
the guy and he said &quot;Verant&#39;s is wrong - I know I tested it&quot;...<br/>

&gt; was that he was using a PGT and barbed whip at 30, but hey, sometimes<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; just like a certain combo. It was when he said &quot;I will sing Hymn and Jig&quot;<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; thought &quot;uh oh.&quot; But I really wanted a group...I died shortly thereafter,<br/>
&gt; however the rest of the evening went smoothly. BTW, his name makes it on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; silly name list but I think I better not mention it :o) </span></blockquote></div>
