<div id="ygrps-yiv-18400375">Sheesh, and I thought I was an old fart at 32.  hehe<br/>
<br/>
As for swapping instruments mid-fight, I think I tried that maybe 2 times, <br/>
and the difference it made wasn&#39;t worth the trouble it was to keep doing <br/>
repeatedly.  Plus I&#39;m one of those people that never quite got the hang of <br/>
using hotkeys for songs.  I&#39;m pretty much stuck on the old mouse for <br/>
twistings, which makes it a little harder to switch songs/instruments.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in a caster-heavy group, I will equip Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine and <br/>
chant.  If I&#39;m in a melee heavy group, I&#39;ll switch to weapons and swing with <br/>
the big boys with Celerity and 2 chants.<br/>
<br/>
But then maybe it helps that I&#39;m usually in a good group and don&#39;t NEED to <br/>
add that little bit of extra damage...<br/>
