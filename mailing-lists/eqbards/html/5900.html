<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033345321"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Saw this on bard message board - made me really<br/>
&gt; sick to read it:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I might not have done the exact same thing to the<br/>
&#39;purchased&#39; character, but I don&#39;t find anything<br/>
wrong with it either. You want to cheat and cut<br/>
in line, you deserve whatever you get by doing<br/>
so. There&#39;s no way in Norrath that I&#39;d even<br/>
consider helping a level 35 player that didn&#39;t<br/>
know where the Karana&#39;s were or that Giants<br/>
don&#39;t &#39;give quests&#39;. They deserve anything evil<br/>
that happens to them in the game.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was level 5 I knew where every<br/>
zone in the game was. I hadn&#39;t been to them<br/>
all of course, but I knew where they were. By<br/>
level 7 I&#39;d made the trip from Felwithe to<br/>
Erudin. A level 35 that didn&#39;t know? Hrmph.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t help cheaters. If you want to, feel<br/>
free. But you&#39;re doing nothing more than<br/>
letting them know it&#39;s ok to be an idiot.</div>
