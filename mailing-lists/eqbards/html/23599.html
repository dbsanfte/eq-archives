Its usually not nice for the student to take control of the class from the<br/>
teacher.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t going to go there, but the internet being what it is, you can<br/>
always count on someone else. ;)<br/>

They probably look at you funny since you are an enchanter asking a bard to<br/>
keep two targets mezzed.  That would be your responsibility since you are<br/>
better at it.  If I group with an enchanter and they ask me to mez targets,<br/>
then I&#39;m gonna assume they are the one clueless about their class, not me.<br/>
I will however likely have songs memmed to bail them out in the event they<br/>
get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Now if there is no enchanter in the group and the bard can&#39;t perform basic<br/>
crowd control because he doesn&#39;t know how, then you have a case.<br/>

Ask them to keep 2 targets mezzed and they look at you funny.  In short, the<br/>
bards I&#39;m grouping with seem so clueless about their class that they&#39;re<br/>
actually detrimental to the group.<br/>
