<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368169884">Couple of observations about each of these over the past couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend it looked like Lullaby only took effect if the MOB wasn&#39;t in<br/>
the process of attacking me at a given moment and wasn&#39;t resisted.  What<br/>
does that mean?  It seemed that if a MOB had just attacked and my song<br/>
pulsed, the MOB went to sleep.  If the MOB (in my case a goblin) had started<br/>
swinging its arm at me and the song pulsed, it would nod, but not go to<br/>
sleep.  It is as if the MOB sleeps, but it then re-agro&#39;ed by its attack on<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that pulling MOBs through other MOBs seems to cancel the<br/>
effect of Lament (much more so now then before) which seems to indicate a<br/>
very small agro radius as a result of the song which I believe is already<br/>
documented.  What I also noticed, however, was that a MOB didn&#39;t always run<br/>
right for me when I pulled it.  If I was at the wrong angle, the MOBs<br/>
approach vector would send it first backwards (agro&#39;ing its buddies) and<br/>
then forward towards me.  As I adjusted my angle of pull, I was able to get<br/>
the MOB to charge a straight line for me instead of making the backwards hop<br/>
and thus agro&#39;ing its buddies.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the Choon and Froon note.  My brother&#39;s druid was looking for them<br/>
in the FOG and ran right through their camp with SoW.  He ended up only<br/>
agro&#39;ing Choon and we had to go back and get Froon for me to charm them to<br/>
fight, so it seems one can be agro&#39;ed without pulling the other.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to puts odds on this working though.<br/>
