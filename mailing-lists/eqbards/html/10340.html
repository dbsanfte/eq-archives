&gt;   Is it being resourceful?  Is it taking advantage of the code?<br/>
&gt;   Does it really matter?  Once I learned of a player &#39;exploiting&#39;<br/>
&gt;   a method against a particular mob, I would alter the behavior<br/>
&gt;   of the monster under those effects to create a more challenging<br/>
&gt;   confrontation.  It wasn&#39;t to ruin the player&#39;s experience, it<br/>
&gt;   was to heighten it.  I am a player of accomplishment.  If I<br/>
&gt;   play a game that&#39;s too easy, I tend to get tired easily.  If I<br/>
&gt;   play a game that offers new challenges each time, I tend to get<br/>
&gt;   addicted, ie EQ.<br/>

nor know about it, or will ever have it.<br/>
<br/>
EQ has definately fallen into the trap of raising the bar - once you start<br/>
this, you start catering to the powergamers and cutting out newbies and<br/>
your whole non-powergaming audience.<br/>
<br/>
Wanna add new tougher areas - fine....but unless something is SOOO broken<br/>
there is no other way - don&#39;t go &#39;fixin&#39; it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t go making what used to be newbie areas 40plus areas - especially ones<br/>
that newbies pretty much HAVE to go thru. Don&#39;t go making changes based on<br/>
server demographics on older servers just cause X% is above X level now.<br/>
<br/>
Since EQ is leveled base - and not very much of a world to &#39;live&#39; in, there<br/>
is an end - you CAN &#39;win&#39; EQ - you hit lvl 50. Many then start newbies, but<br/>
with equipment that most only dream of till the upper 20&#39;s or higher. You<br/>
do NOT have to compensate for this - it&#39;s an ever increasing spiral - and<br/>
the only people you hurt are the REAL newbies.</div>
