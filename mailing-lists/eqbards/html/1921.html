<div id="ygrps-yiv-98731772">I do not believe bards playing songs has anything to do with boats crashing.<br/>
Every time I get on the boat I equip my mandolin and play Hymn to keep my<br/>
strings skill maxed out. I haven&#39;t had any problems with it as of yet.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Boat Crashes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I had one heck of a night trying to get back to Freeport from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Butcherblock - the boat crashed  three times.  What would happen is first<br/>
all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped...<br/>
The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on<br/>
the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;    The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first<br/>
time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The<br/>
second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it<br/>
crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;    So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth<br/>
(like all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>
