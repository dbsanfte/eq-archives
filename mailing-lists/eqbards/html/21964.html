&gt;is a nice boon for 2pp, especially since Light Heal potions cost 11pp and<br/>
&gt;are Lore.  With my Squad Ring (Healing 1chg, rechargeable), Prayer Beads<br/>
&gt;(Healing 2chgs), and new Ring (Greater Healing 1chg) I have quite an arsenal<br/>
&gt;of emergency healing on hand.  Thankfully the Ring and Prayer Beads are no<br/>
&gt;No Drop so I can move them to another character if necessary.<br/>

a fully-discharged item.  Was that fixed?<br/>
