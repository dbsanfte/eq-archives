<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982955754">On the other hand they make some NPC&#39;s impossible kill.  There is a <br/>
developing storyline quest starting up in Neriak with an NPC claiming to be <br/>
the Daughter of Innoruk (sp?).  I have read several reports that groups have <br/>
attacked this NPC and been unable to inflict no damage at all even though <br/>
she is a green con.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m curious though what would happen if you had about a dozen<br/>
&gt; &gt;L50 bards continuously Pixie Striking Nagafen to interrupt his<br/>
&gt; &gt;spells.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then verant would nerf pixie strike to only work on level 10 mobs or lower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;:( Not happy about their solutions.  I also heard that over the weekend<br/>
&gt;they held an aborted quest on Bristlebane. Aborted because someone killed<br/>
&gt;&quot;the important NPC&quot;.  I mean, how stupid does Verant have to be to not<br/>
&gt;concieve that some player will try to kill their NPC &quot;just because&quot;????<br/>
