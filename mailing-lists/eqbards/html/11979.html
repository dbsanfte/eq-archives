&gt; Well I think I am getting tired of my measly well balanced long sword,and I<br/>
&gt; think its time for a new slasher :)<br/>
&gt; I was thinking of the Brazen Brass Kilij and was wondering-how common is the<br/>
&gt; sand giant with the plans for this quest-is he camped?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Brazen Brass Kilij? sure I know the damage is good on it, but the<br/>
WEIGHT! What are you a Barbarian Bard? (totally skipping the part about<br/>
how rare the low level SG is and how he is instantly mobbed by everyone<br/>
who /cons him and says &quot;hrmm, that SG is even to me!&quot; AND the fact that<br/>
according to sceeen shots posted here his name is NOT &quot;sand giant&quot; but<br/>
&quot;a sand giant&quot; just like all the other sand giants in the desert).<br/>

I use a 1h Silvery War Axe (6/22) and a staff of writhing (9/33 procs<br/>
48point DD). I bought the Staff for 350pp, normal price 400pp, and<br/>
ripped the SWA from the hands of an Elite Honor Guard in Permafrost.<br/>
Just today, while I was soloing a griffenne (chain/fear/DDD) it proc&#39;d<br/>
FIVE (count it FIVE) times. Usually good for 1-2 procs in a 30-60 second<br/>
fight.<br/>
