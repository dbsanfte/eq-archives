<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089957938">Ok, I&#39;ll bite - exactly how is this an &#39;advantage&#39;? And how does it affect<br/>
YOU?<br/>
<br/>
Unless you play on a PvP server - or as a PvP player - it never ceases to<br/>
amaze me how some folks think someone with &#39;better&#39; stuff than they have<br/>
are somehow at an &#39;advantage&#39;. Unless it affects YOU - does it REALLY matter?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah - they might have it a bit easier, so? Given the opportunity to use<br/>
better stuff - don&#39;t you take it? I just can&#39;t understand this at all -<br/>
especially in an environment that is so group oriented that any pluses a<br/>
group member may have is going to HELP you.<br/>
<br/>

 But now<br/>
