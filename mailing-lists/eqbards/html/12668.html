of our members started their original characters on the Cazic Thule<br/>

for Casters Realm, so Baelish is my link to the Povar people.  If LoD<br/>
didn&#39;t have contacts on other servers, if we didn&#39;t do our research, we<br/>
would not be where we are today.  Oh, and I also read this mailing list,<br/>
which in and of itself is a wealth of information.<br/>

around 150 to 160.  With a bard song, well, you can do the math.  You&#39;re<br/>
right, experience with dragons does make a big difference.  That&#39;s where<br/>
I&#39;m drawing what I say from.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Well, &quot;easily&quot; is definitely a relative term.  If we lose 12 out<br/>
of 30 people on a Vox raid, to us that was a &quot;hard&quot; Vox run.  For another<br/>
guild, that may have been &quot;easy&quot;.  Honestly, I think the reason is because<br/>
of our guilds class makeup.  We have tons of warriors and clerics, and<br/>
we&#39;re short on hybrids.  That doesn&#39;t happen very often, as you can see<br/>
from the makeup of most high level guilds.<br/>
<br/>
	For most people though, bard resists will make the difference<br/>
between winning and losing.  I know we&#39;ve definitely cut our losses down<br/>
with bards in the primary groups.  I&#39;ve done Vox with only 1 death among<br/>
all the people who were there (level 40 druid died), and that time we had<br/>
Weadaneye and Tokisada there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - you&#39;re wrong about our equipment, we trade out everything for resist<br/>
equipment.<br/>
