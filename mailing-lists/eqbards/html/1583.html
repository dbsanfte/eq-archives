<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096383802">i used it against my roommate in a duel to see how much damage it did<br/>
when i was level 18 and had about a 50 in brass it did 15 damage per pulse<br/>
I&#39;ve got my brass at 100 now and am level 19 and I think it still does about<br/>
the same.  the advantage to it is against 3 or 4 enemies, then your doing 45<br/>
or 60 damage a pulse (total)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m an 18th level Bard on CZ. I was just curious if anybody had specific<br/>
&gt; stats on the damage done using Denons Disruptive Cord. Also, does the<br/>
&gt; damage inflicted increase with your level, your brass skill or both. I<br/>
&gt; overheard  a 21 level bard say that she does 79 hp worth of damage with<br/>
&gt; this song per pulse when using her horn. I failed to ask her how she<br/>
&gt; arrived at this figure, but now that I have the song (which does work<br/>
&gt; pretty good), I wish I had. Anybody have the answer to this?<br/>
