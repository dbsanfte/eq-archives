<div id="ygrps-yiv-472682472">GZ contacted me today to ask what I was doing and how my results were so<br/>
different from his 125 tries against a snake, 1 attack when it should not<br/>
have.  I sent him the text file again with my breakdown.  Anyone else<br/>
interested in seeing the log file can email me and I will send it to them.<br/>
It showed a 20% false nod rate for mobs in steamfont of level 3 or less.  I<br/>
offered to have GZ come onto E&#39;ci and I would gladly duplicate the test for<br/>
him while he was present as I have no doubt it would happen the same way it<br/>
did before.  I would guess that we got his attention though and he is<br/>
perplexed as to why he was unable to duplicate our results. <br/>

Kitasi,<br/>

I remember you posting a few weeks back that you did extensive tests with<br/>
lullaby against newbie mobs and that you sent the results to GZ?  Did he<br/>
ever send you a response?  Perhaps you can repost the results on the message<br/>
board Rokenn posted his original thread on and get some feedback on your<br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing that still bugs me on this topic.  GZ stated that higher<br/>
level mobs get a second chance to resist lullaby and pixie.  He acknowledged<br/>
that no resist message is generated if they make the second resist and that<br/>
is something they will work on.  But based off the numerous posts that have<br/>
been made on this topic, this was not always the case.  Until a couple of<br/>
months ago, if you got the two songs to stick you didn&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
the mobs still attacking you unless someone in your party woke them up by<br/>
mistake (i.e. attacked them directly or cast AE spells).  So here is a<br/>
two-part question to John Kim and the higher level bards who have been<br/>
posting on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
1) Did lullaby and pixie work as expected against higher level mobs but then<br/>
Verant secretly nerfed the two songs to give higher level mobs the second<br/>
resist chance.  Example: at 30th level, you could consistently pixie strike<br/>
lizard judicators and they stopped attacking.  New patch goes in, your still<br/>
30th level and fighting lizard judicators.  After the patch, you notice that<br/>
pixie isn&#39;t working like it used to.    <br/>
<br/>
2) Is it possible that when you started noticing that lullaby and pixie<br/>
strike didn&#39;t work as well as they used to, the reason for it may be that<br/>
you were gaining levels and began fighting more often the higher level mobs<br/>
that get the second resist?  Example: your 30th level and fighting the<br/>
glyphed mobs in the Mistmoore graveyard.  Pixie strike seems to work as<br/>
expected.   At 35th level, you move into the courtyard in Mistmoore and<br/>
start fighting all the ancille mobs.  You notice that mobs are still<br/>
attacking even though they didn&#39;t resist the song.  You think pixie strike<br/>
has been secretly nerfed but in fact nothing has changed with the song<br/>
except the ancille mobs get a second resist check while the glyphed mobs<br/>
only get one.  <br/>

&gt; large<br/>
&gt; rats are now higher level monsters GZ is a fool.  I don&#39;t usually say that<br/>
&gt; lightly, but in this case it is well deserved.  Giving us the lame excuse<br/>
&gt; that higher level monsters get an unseen second save is blatantly<br/>
&gt; ridiculous.  The song does the exact same thing against level one<br/>
&gt; monsters.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had it up to my ears with this ridiculous rhetoric.<br/>
