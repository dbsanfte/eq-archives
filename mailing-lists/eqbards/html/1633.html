<b>Subject:</b> Patch changes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122224689">These are the bard specific changes in the last patch (except for /follow,<br/>
which<br/>
is just a huge benefit to a party with bards playing Selo&#39;s or 19)<br/>
<br/>
Bug fixes and newly implemented features<br/>
<br/>
- &#39;Procing&#39; (items that cast spells) weapons no longer break Bard&#39;s singing<br/>
- We have implemented an Auto-follow command.  To auto-follow another<br/>
player, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;.  You must be grouped with<br/>
the character in order to successfully carry out the command.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Spell Changes<br/>
<br/>
- The Bard spell &quot;Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge&quot; will now require the use of Mana.<br/>
- No spell or effect that accelerates the process of mana regeneration will<br/>
work on a Bard.<br/>
- Tuyen&#39;s Songs now have range.<br/>
<br/>
So, now that 38,43 and 46 are apparently working, any of you high level<br/>
bards have<br/>
the straight poop on them?<br/>
<br/>
In particular what&#39;s your take on Dirge?  How does the damage it does<br/>
compare<br/>
with the best damage song we have before then?  Looks like they made sure<br/>
it would be used only once in a long while, is it powerful enough to even<br/>
have memorized?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard 400+ dmg, how does that compare to other casters DD/AOE spells at<br/>
that<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
Now that the two Tuyen&#39;s have a range, does anyone have numbers on them?<br/>
<br/>
