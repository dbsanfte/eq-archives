<b>Subject:</b> Solo vs Group XP, was  RE: Class balance (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210355364">hehe after having played for almost 2 years I can pretty honestly state that<br/>
killing big mobs slower is far less XP efficient than killing smaller (but<br/>
still big) mobs rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
IE:  A red is a red is a red.  Once you get a red con, in my experience, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter _how_ red it is, you get a certain amt of xp.  (it&#39;s capped).<br/>
So, if you can destroy a bunch of &quot;Barely red&quot; critters rapidly you will<br/>
&#39;net&#39; more experience than if you kill &quot;very red&quot; creatures at a slower<br/>
rate.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, Verant&#39;s XP system is so wacked out that if you kill<br/>
tons of &quot;high blue&quot; creatures _extremely_ rapidly you will net more<br/>
experience than killing reds at a slower rate.   I did /bug and /feedback on<br/>
this during beta many many times but nothing has ever been done.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  Solo you will get more xp than with a group unless that group<br/>
is VERY efficient at getting lots of kills rapidly.  If they can kill reds<br/>
quickly then a group will get xp faster than a soloist doing blues quickly.<br/>
But if they are killing npc&#39;s at a slower rate than the soloist the soloist<br/>
will dust them in xp.<br/>
<br/>
a)  Solo XP has no dividers<br/>
b)  Solo XP you can kill low blues and get more xp than with a group doing<br/>
reds if you know what you&#39;re doing (because of the xp cap on reds).<br/>

&gt; &gt; True, he does, but a well balanced group _without_ a necro is far better<br/>
&gt; &gt; than a well balanced group _with_ a necro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can say the same thing about pretty much most of the<br/>
&gt; classes.  A &quot;well balanced group&quot; typically means cleric,<br/>
&gt; 2 warriors, enchanter, and 2 hard nukers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A good group will kill things<br/>
&gt; &gt; far faster than a necro can solo thus his &quot;real&quot; damage never gets<br/>
started.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Necro&#39;s are very weak in groups because there&#39;s no time for their DoT&#39;s<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; ramp up in dmg.  Typically it takes a full minute or more for a Necro<br/>
DOT to<br/>
&gt; &gt; realize full potential in dmg.  Most fights with a good group last far<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; &gt; than that (unless you&#39;re talking dragons/planes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most fights don&#39;t last this long because people are (1)<br/>
&gt; killing stuff that&#39;s too easy for them, or (2) overnuking.<br/>
&gt; The /con and exp system is a bit screwy in this game so I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t go so far as to say exp is better if you kill at an<br/>
&gt; optimal rate, but all other things being equal it is.<br/>
&gt; Remember, being grouped *increases* your survival time, so<br/>
&gt; (nuking mana permitting) you are free to let fights go on<br/>
&gt; *longer* than if you&#39;re playing solo.  Fighting a mob of<br/>
&gt; proper difficulty for the group (i.e. the R ratio I came up<br/>
&gt; with being less than but close to 1), the fight duration will<br/>
&gt; be near the survival time for the group.<br/>
