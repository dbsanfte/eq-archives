<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-72156708">well, to be honest yes we are a class to fill-in when others can not, mostly<br/>
an enchanter and and to a lesser degree a shaman.  if the group relies on<br/>
the bard though, we come through for them in all regards.  i have no trouble<br/>
finding groups because of my guild and my friends, but i can see how it may<br/>
be difficult for a lone bard to find a place in groups that do not know what<br/>
we are capable of, and insist on those that all too often get picked above<br/>
us.  stick with it though, we all know how important bards are =)  and the<br/>
problems finding groups slowly disappear as you level past 50, where good<br/>
bards and enchanters are harder to find.<br/>
