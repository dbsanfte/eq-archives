 </span></blockquote>Good question, tough call.  If you have lots of open space,<br/>
have more than enough to fight (don&#39;t mind losing exp on some<br/>
mobs), and your healers don&#39;t have to do a lot of healing, I&#39;d<br/>
have to say charm is better.  If you can charm something and<br/>
your group concentrates on one target *away* from the charmed<br/>
mob, all the others will usually attack the charmed mob.  When<br/>
your charm lets up, they will all charge you, which is why the<br/>
open space is important (once they get within melee range of<br/>
you, they will continue attacking mostly you even though the<br/>
charmed mob is beating on them from behind).  Just keep this<br/>
up to distract the other mobs and thin them out until your<br/>
party finishes the one it&#39;s fighting.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, if you&#39;re fighting stuff in close quarters, or high<br/>
/cons, this isn&#39;t as viable a strategy since charm can be<br/>
resisted and in my experience, three successive resists in a<br/>
bad situation is enough to drop my health to where I start to<br/>
think about running.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is how much damage you&#39;re taking and how often<br/>
you&#39;re being healed.  If you take a lot of damage and a cleric<br/>
heals you, any untaunted mobs (i.e. ones that haven&#39;t been<br/>
charmed) will attack the healer.  This is where Lullaby (or<br/>
any area effect song) is really useful since they make the<br/>
mobs stick to you freeing the healer to cast.<br/>
<br/>
In general, I tend to use charm when we&#39;re fighting just 2-4<br/>
mobs and there are no other mobs nearby (your charmee tends to<br/>
be lower level than you, which invites green mobs into<br/>
attacking it).  2-4 mobs in close quarters or with others<br/>
nearby, I will use pixie strike (or rely on an enchanter to<br/>
mesmerize).  Fewer mobs = less chaos = less likelihood to be<br/>
distracted trying to charm or strike without realizing you&#39;re<br/>
about to die.  Strike can actually be better with 3 mobs since<br/>
I can consistently keep two of them chasing pixies, thus<br/>
leaving them no time to attack me.  With charm, there is a<br/>
small window between when charm wears out and when all the<br/>
mobs can attack you.  More mobs than this and I would use<br/>
Lullaby (assuming you have one healer - two and/or a paladin<br/>
with lay hands is better).<br/>
