&gt;i haven&#39;t tried pixie strike in PoF yet.  this message just came through a<br/>
&gt;couple weeks old hehe, and since then we have all been seeing how the song<br/>
&gt;is broken.  by the time you can get it to stick you&#39;ll be at your bind<br/>
&gt;point.  i asked another level 50 bard up there once if he thought we should<br/>
&gt;use it, as i read about bards in PoF using it successfully, but as it was so<br/>
&gt;tough to get to work we decided not to bother.  so other than pixie strike,<br/>
&gt;i use the same songs you do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a pain/risky to mez stuff, and i definatly see that effect where its<br/>
hard to start the mez on something. It mostly depends on the target and<br/>
whether or not an enchanter is handy to start laying tashan down. Fiends,<br/>
Toads i can mez with little or no trouble, enchanter or not. Scarelings,<br/>
Boogymen, Gorgons, Phantasms, Frightfingers,warrriors i can mez but they<br/>
wake up a lot, though its still worth it imo to mez them. Tashan helps a<br/>
lot here i have found. With the lvl 44 tashan, i can mez even knights and<br/>
worry wraiths. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, PoF is basically done for me, i have nothing left in the zone i<br/>
want (minus any new items that might pop up after the recent itemization).<br/>
Well exceppting cazic&#39;s flute, but the first time we killed cazic we got 8<br/>
plat. Second time we got puppet strings and a ruby crown (just worth money) :(<br/>
<br/>
And they always reset the server before he spawns, so we dont get to kill<br/>
him nearly often as we would like. <br/>
<br/>
Course the poh just opened, and we are doing that now. Maestro needs to<br/>
die, bastard just ate me again lol. Course he had a mace :/<br/>
