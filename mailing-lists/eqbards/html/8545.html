&gt; &lt;&lt; Hmm, I don&#39;t recall hill giants starting to /con anything but<br/>
&gt;  yellow or red until I was level 35.  Cyclopses were blue at 30<br/>
&gt;  though (at least most of them). &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And? :) I killed 4 hg&#39;s today realatively quickly (didnt time this one, was <br/>
&gt; too busy tryin not to die). And yes they were all red. As I said be <br/>
&gt; creative!! Bards are an extremely strong class is played right. Anyways, <br/>
&gt; think about it, if ya can&#39;t figure out how I do this, l&#39;ll let my secret out <br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, only way I can think of is running with SoW or<br/>
Accelerando while charming two to fight each other.  I avoid<br/>
doing that because (lately) it&#39;s so difficult to find one<br/>
giant much less two, and they&#39;re likely to kill a lot of<br/>
people as you run around trying to get charm to stick.  I<br/>
suppose North and West Karana is broad and unpopulated enough<br/>
to do this reasonably safely.<br/>
