<div id="ygrps-yiv-775326055">&quot;WinME is an abomination that will hopefully be shortlived&quot;  This is a<br/>
direct quote from one of my techie coworkers who plays everything in sight<br/>
computer game-wise.  He&#39;s running Win2k now but not for EQ, that&#39;s still on<br/>
98.<br/>

As long as we&#39;re off-topic, though, anyone out there gaming on Win2k, and <br/>
which do you feel is better (for gaming): Win2k, WinME, or Win98?<br/>
