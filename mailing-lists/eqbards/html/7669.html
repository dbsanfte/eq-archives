day.<br/>
<br/>
if you don&#39;t have a cleric in your group in lower guk (or anywhere for that<br/>
matter in high level dungeons), then you should expect to die often.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Bard & Wizard are fighting in lower Guk. Bard is bound in<br/>
&gt; Freeport while Wizard is bound in Innothule right outside<br/>
&gt; the Guk zone line. Bard & Wizard die. Bard runs through 5<br/>
&gt; zones, and does so naked with no weapon. Wizard pops up in<br/>
&gt; Innothule at zone entrance, memorizes spells, casts shield<br/>
&gt; on himself, has his main weapons ready (spells) and heads<br/>
&gt; down to his corpse and group. Bard is still running (albeit<br/>
&gt; faster than the wizard is) and has *maybe* made it to the<br/>
&gt; Oasis by now. </span></blockquote></div>
