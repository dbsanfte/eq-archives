<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743578258">actually it works on everyone who has the same faction as the target while<br/>
you are in that zone until you sing it on another faction.  Because it adds<br/>
to your faction for the faction of the target there is lots of overlap, ie<br/>
all merchants in a city, all corrupt guards, etc.  Also since it currently<br/>
will raise glares (the first stage of KoS) to Apprehensive or dubious (both<br/>
non-KoS), it will get you out of the early stages of KoS.  Once you hit<br/>
scowls you are out of luck unless very high level bards get a better result.<br/>

I have never used the carrilion anywhere I would be KOS.  Its been so long<br/>
since we discussed this song on the list, I&#39;ve forgotten how it works.<br/>
IIRC, it only works on one target and wears off very quickly.  That works OK<br/>
if there is only one mob around but what if there are multiple mobs that are<br/>
KOS to you?  It would be nice if the carillion was AE and kept working as<br/>
long as you kept playing it.  That might allow us to complete the Stein of<br/>
Moggok quest (old Glowing Stein quest) as well as other quests in evil<br/>
cities.  I would like to go explore the evil cities but haven&#39;t done so yet<br/>
because I didn&#39;t want to risk my invis song blinking out at the wrong time.<br/>

&gt; One bonus a magical flute could give is to make the invis song work<br/>
&gt; against<br/>
&gt; all mobs at all times, no matter if they can inherently see invis or not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A wind instrument, IMO, would be useless. How would it<br/>
&gt; &gt; benefit us to be more invisible, or more levitated? :)<br/>
