<div id="ygrps-yiv-642752539">I meant single grouping experiences with &quot;my daily experiences&quot;, I wasn&#39;t totally clear on that.  In 6-man exp. groups we kick ass, no matter how Thott&#39;s numbers seem to stack up.<br/>
<br/>
But, I disagree on raid situations.  Most guilds consider 1 Bard &quot;needed&quot; for OOS.  Some guilds consider 1 Bard (OOS) plus one 60 Bard per tank group needed (puretone + damage shields).  Depending on your target, that could be 1 extra Bard or several, depending how many tanks are rotating.  <br/>

  Well Dark you wouldn&#39;t being experiencing anything if you weren&#39;t on the<br/>
  raid.  And if you weren&#39;t on the raid, the raid wouldn&#39;t be noticing<br/>
  anything different either.  You need, &quot;need&quot; not want, 1 bard on a raid.<br/>
  Any more bards would be better replaced by another class.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m in total agreement.  I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in group play<br/>
  we simply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that knows how<br/>
  to use us, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers about<br/>
  how we don&#39;t scale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t<br/>
  mirror my experiences on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
  Hopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not anything more<br/>
  grand. :)<br/>
