<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806203535">Wasn&#39;t really involved in that discussion much, but it definitely was<br/>
lasting full duration at least 90% of the time for me against &lt;red cons<br/>
before yesterday&#39;s patch.<br/>

I still contend that for me Chains is very unreliable and wears off so<br/>
quickly and so randomly that in order to be effective it must be refreshed<br/>
every pulse eliminating my ability to weave another song with it... at least<br/>
for me.  I&#39;m glad to finally see that I&#39;m not the only one have this<br/>
problem.  I was scolded by the list for having put the song away so recently<br/>
I pulled it back out and found that it still pretty much renders me useless<br/>
for anything but chaining when I become runner control.<br/>
<br/>
My level is 48 and I noticed the problem &quot;again&quot; this past week on anything<br/>
from green/blue GKs in Sol B (not sure what level they are?) to Seafury<br/>
Cyclops (con blue) to Ogre Guards in Oggok (con green now mostly) to Fire<br/>
Imps on the Efreeti raid (also con blue).  I&#39;m really surprised that more of<br/>
you aren&#39;t having problems with the duration of chains.<br/>
<br/>
Charm?  I&#39;d say it lasts for the full 3 ticks 90% of the time for me, Mez? I<br/>
was mezing 3 Bats at Sol A zone in Sol B with no problems most of the<br/>
time... only problem I&#39;ve ever had with mez was the initial resists and<br/>
these got much much lower with full charisma gear on.  Fear?  hehe, only use<br/>
it in duels these days and it ALWAYS seems to stick the full duration on<br/>
PCs...<br/>
