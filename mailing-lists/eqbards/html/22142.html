<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928893206">That is somewhat true... Lotsa SS out there, lots of it belongs to warriors<br/>
and stuff that think cobalt is an even trade for (haha right!)  So i keep to<br/>
myself quiet... Got free ss boots a while back from a friend. Got a free SS<br/>
helm other night from some friends who just came out of seb. And 2 nights<br/>
ago i get a few people asking me about bards in guildchat, one was asking me<br/>
what i was using because he wanted to &quot;twink&quot; his level 30 bard (ok at least<br/>
its not a lev 4). And then a good buddie sends me a tell right afterwards<br/>
asking me if i had my ss gloves, i told him thats why im hunting in karnors<br/>
at 41. Soooo next time i see his chanter i get a free set of ss gloves.  <br/>
<br/>
Another question: what are people using as a cloak? (other then cloak of<br/>
flames)<br/>
I got a kunzar cloak last night (hey i was using bronze) and was wondering<br/>
if i should ask my buddy to trade me his lizzie cloak, or should i try to<br/>
buy a better cloak, if so which?<br/>

Hahah Correction!  The bard only ones tend to be ninja looted by fellow<br/>
guild members to put in the &quot;bank&quot; (i.e. their level 4 bard twink who they<br/>
can&#39;t play worth crap but want to equip).  I&#39;ve seen lots o singing steel<br/>
disappear this way too but now am keeping track!<br/>
<br/>
On a sad note, Tani is all of a sudden dying in 30 :(  Died twice *pouts*...<br/>
those mobs in Frontier Mountains are MEAN!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice on weapons :) I&#39;ll work my way towards those!<br/>

&gt; Sounds like you have some nice weapons there.  The spine I am <br/>
&gt; not familiar<br/>
&gt; with, the Walking Stick I have and use because I like the <br/>
&gt; effect message:<br/>
&gt; &#39;somemob01 glances nervously about&#39; (tashan). The &#39;claw <br/>
&gt; thing&#39; sounds like<br/>
&gt; Sainey&#39;s Claw which I also have and use because it adds 10 <br/>
&gt; AC.  Some next<br/>
&gt; step bard weaps are: Sionache&#39;s Partisan 9/19 piercing, <br/>
&gt; Symphonic Saber 11<br/>
&gt; 23 with the effect that lowers you on the hate list.  Jade <br/>
&gt; mace 9 18 is good<br/>
&gt; too but maybe a bit harder to get as they are usable by other classes.<br/>
&gt; Harmonic Dagger is 10 21 - awesome.  breath of Harmony 10 18 <br/>
&gt; effect: Niv&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Preservation - uber.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of these weps are normally obtain by level 50+ groups in <br/>
&gt; the Kunark<br/>
&gt; Dungeons.  The bard only ones tend to get traded off or passed down.  <br/>

&gt; walking stick,<br/>
&gt; jagged chodekai spine and some claw thing from the City of <br/>
&gt; Mist... can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember the name but its a piercer..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anway, looking for next step up suggestions :)<br/>
