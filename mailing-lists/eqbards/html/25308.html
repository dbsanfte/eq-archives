<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622070379">According to posts on the Backstage - Nortlav was toned down a bit - the<br/>
Lifetap now is just damage (ie doesn&#39;t transfer the HP&#39;s back to himself)<br/>

Yael has uber aggro range. I highly doubt that you can take the scalekeeper<br/>
without Yael having a hissy. When we went there, we fought Yael right on his<br/>
spawn point with no interference from Nortlav. People say that Nortlav<br/>
aggros on golems and regular stuff there. He&#39;s supposed to be coded &quot;beta</div>
