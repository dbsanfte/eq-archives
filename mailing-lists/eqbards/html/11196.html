<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483075660">About a week ago, some friends and I decided to camp the bartender&#39;s<br/>
room in Sol A.  We fought our way to the doorway of the room then healed and<br/>
medded up.  Our ranger peeked inside the room to see how many spawns were up<br/>
(a group had been there earlier) and saw that the room was full.  What<br/>
happened next was something very rare in groups, we set up a gameplan.<br/>
    Everyone (that didn;t have one set already) mapped out an /assist hotkey<br/>
for our puller and we discussed who would cast what and when they would cast<br/>
it.  Since the major worry was that the whole room would rush us and folks<br/>
would get the stuffing beat out of them by multiple MOBs before one could be<br/>
killed, I told them about Lullaby.  With that info, (and when we were<br/>
healed, buffed, and medded) our puller targetted the most dangerous MOB and<br/>
we all rushed in!  I fired up Lullaby (everything in the room con&#39;d blue to<br/>
me), Lull&#39;d the other gobbies, and we surrounded the MOB  our puller ran to<br/>
and hit the /assist hotkey.  Four or five MOBs later (with a group of 4 or 5<br/>
upper 20&#39;-very low 30&#39;s... no nukers or pure tanks, just me, a couple of<br/>
druids, and a ranger or two) a few of us were around 1/2 hp, the druids were<br/>
almost OOM, but we stood victorious!  Later in the night, however, our<br/>
puller grabbed a bit more than we could handle (8 or 10, I believe) and I<br/>
saw so many resisited Lullabies that I thought someone was playing a joke on<br/>
me.  Corpse recovery soon followed.<br/>
    The moral of the story?  When it works, it works WELL, and when it<br/>
doesn&#39;t... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
(btw, yes it was waaaay more powerful in P4.  Damn the nerfs!)<br/>

&gt;Very cool suggestions.  I too have seen a bard in a group simply by using<br/>
&gt;lullaby pull off some amazing battles.  What is truely interesting is that<br/>
&gt;according to Verant a DOT spell should nix the Effect of lullaby but a<br/>

&gt;down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lullaby is also a great way to help lower level folk or parties fighting<br/>
&gt;ubermobs that you can still effect as it slows down the number of times the<br/>
&gt;mob can hit them.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Possible use for lullaby at L17...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; A friend on his L17 Bard, and I on my 19 shaman were in East Karana<br/>
&gt;&gt; killing gnoll reavers and undead reavers. He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>
&gt;&gt; back. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>
&gt;&gt; attacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>
&gt;&gt; target, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>
&gt;&gt; with Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>
&gt;&gt; back to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>
&gt;&gt; without being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>
&gt;&gt; It was quite a sight.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Two things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>
&gt;&gt; new player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; he&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>
&gt;&gt; primary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>
&gt;&gt; questions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>
