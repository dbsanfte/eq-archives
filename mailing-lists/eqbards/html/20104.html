<div id="ygrps-yiv-144228295"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When was the last time you entered a zone to see shouts of <br/>
&gt; &quot;Bard wanted for<br/>
&gt; group&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has happened to me in Firiona Vie, but yes it was after 32. I don&#39;t mean<br/>
to gainsaying all your points, but I just keep grouping with tanks who<br/>
freely offer &quot;ahhh, I love bards&quot; after the first battle. I have a tank (not<br/>
in my guild) who sends me a tell every single time he is setting up a group,<br/>
he sees a bard as invaluable glue. I have had  casters who when I shout<br/>
&quot;bard looking for fort group&quot; shout &quot;No your not, you are with us. Dibs on<br/>
the bard&quot; (yeah I had grouped once with them before, and yes that was at<br/>
32). I just have had great luck with being invited in and kept in a group.<br/>
32 changes a LOT, but not everything. The trick is education *laughs*<br/>
letting the group know what you can do. If a pickup group I am in is looking<br/>
a bit of downtime I always mem guardian/purifying rhythms and, playing the<br/>
drum, say &quot;Check out your resists&quot;. It ALWAYS gets amazed groupsays with<br/>
lots of caps and exclamations. And suggestions we go fight Cenobites<br/>
*laughs*<br/>
