Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work?<br/>
A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% <br/>
chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a <br/>
5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). <br/>
What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, <br/>
Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for <br/>
Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the <br/>
difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell.<br/>
<br/>
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has <br/>
a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill <br/>
(Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum <br/>
of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did <br/>
not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we <br/>
assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not <br/>
made any spells with higher difficulty).<br/>
<br/>
If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, <br/>
etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your <br/>
statistic above 75.<br/>
<br/>
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the <br/>
spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at <br/>
level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 <br/>
Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the <br/>
appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% <br/>
chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our <br/>
Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a <br/>
minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) <br/>
after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her <br/>
Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell.<br/>
<br/>
A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind <br/>
Affinity without fizzling earlier.<br/>
