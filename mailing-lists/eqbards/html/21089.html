<div id="ygrps-yiv-7944976">Ok gripe time..<br/>
<br/>
Remember the time Tani had all her items stolen.. then a guy gave me his<br/>
items to hold as collateral in a lore bag.. bag and items in bag poofed.. GM<br/>
ADMITTED it was a known bug, nothing was done. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Halana died to Skarlon before the servers came down. Find out<br/>
that that xp is LOST.. which is UTTER BS as taht is a weeks worth of xp..<br/>
and i&#39;m not talking part time player here.  I&quot;m talking every night, 4-5<br/>
hours plus 12 hour days on the weekend.  XP at 55 is SLOW.<br/>
<br/>
I did finally receive part of the xp back but it was grudging.  These are<br/>
the kind of things they need to fix!  (along with bard stuff of course)<br/>
<br/>
Ok done whining now :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;they may be incredibly rare, but what if it happened to you? <br/>
&gt;  i bet you<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;have it so far down on the priority list then.  what is the higher<br/>
&gt; priority, something<br/>
&gt; &gt;people have already learned to work around or something <br/>
&gt; which can wipe out<br/>
&gt; &gt;hundreds of hours of playtime on a character?<br/>
&gt; &gt;you know well over 100 players, eh?  out of the 200000 <br/>
&gt; subscribers.  yeah,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;an appropriate sample size to determine that poofed corpses <br/>
&gt; are just not a<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it happened to me?  Either they&#39;d fix it or I&#39;d be done <br/>
&gt; with EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what customer service is about.  No it still wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
&gt; higher priority.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was only counting the people I know in RL personally.  I <br/>
&gt; doubt anyone<br/>
&gt; knows an appropriate sample size in that way.  From seeing the boards<br/>
&gt; though, there are hundreds of posts on bard song bugs, very <br/>
&gt; few on having<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own corpse poof.<br/>
