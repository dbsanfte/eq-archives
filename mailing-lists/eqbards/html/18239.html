<br/>
Bellow&#39;s may have been breaking root...I&#39;ve noticed this at lower levels<br/>
(i&#39;m at 23 now)<br/>
Bellow&#39;s has a component that &#39;shoves&#39; the target backwards from where they<br/>
are standing (i&#39;ve seen accounts of people &#39;shoving&#39; D&#39;vinn(?) out of the<br/>
Tower Window in Crushbone, using bellow.<br/>
Anyways, when working with an enchanter using their &#39;root&#39; spells, we<br/>
noticed that bellows would &#39;push&#39; the mob out of root quite often.  Whether<br/>
this is intentional or a side effect of the &#39;shoving&#39; that bellows gives, i<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
(note: I don&#39;t have any hard data on this...shouldn&#39;t be too hard to test,<br/>
though)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Break Root<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     Last night I joined up with an Enchanter (lvl 40) and Druid (38) from<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; guild (I&#39;m 40) in Frontier Mountains.  We were pulling stuff near a zone<br/>
&gt; boundary (Burning Wood I believe),<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Anyway - the strategy we were using was - the Enchanter would cast<br/>
&gt; Immobilize - sick the pets on them And Dot and DD away.  I joined up with<br/>
&gt; them and equipped my MM Battle Drum and Chanted and Bellowed away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     They noticed that after I came - the Mobs Root Broke much more often.<br/>
&gt; We experimented with &quot;Just Singing Mana&quot; and then very selectively singing<br/>
&gt; the songs - and had trouble coming to conclusion as to what caused it to<br/>
&gt; break root.  (I&#39;m using the term root generically - again we were actually<br/>
&gt; using the Enchanter Immobilize spell).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The only theory that we came up with that seemed to make sense was<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; any time a spell hit there was a chance it would break.  Since the bard<br/>
DOTs<br/>
&gt; duration are so much shorter than the Druid&#39;s and Enchanter&#39;s - I would<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to guess that is why it broke much more often after I arrived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Anyone have any insight on this?  If this is true it adds an<br/>
interesting<br/>
&gt; wrinkle to the balance issue (i.e. Verant considering Bards more<br/>
&quot;powerful&quot;<br/>
&gt; in many regards due to we don&#39;t need mana.  A side-effect of &quot;casting&quot;<br/>
makes<br/>
&gt; the short duration of our songs much less &quot;powerful&quot;...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Also - using this strategy - I wasn&#39;t sure what the best third song<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; to the two chants - settled on the 21 hp&#39;s I get from Bellows - any<br/>
opinions<br/>
&gt; on this as well?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
