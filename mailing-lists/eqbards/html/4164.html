&gt;You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
&gt;multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
&gt;a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
&gt;to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
&gt;depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
&gt;increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
&gt;jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>
&gt;out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>
&gt;when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This definitely true of some people John, but like all stereotypes, the<br/>
&quot;twinker&quot; stereotype doesn&#39;t apply to everyone. I do acknowledge what you<br/>
are saying though. I hadn&#39;t thought of it like that. But<br/>
the intent of my original post was to state that you(generic you) shouldn&#39;t<br/>
get all pissed off at seeing a twinked character, as it can quite easily<br/>
just be someone who has started anew. It really bugs me when people prejudge<br/>
others.<br/>

&gt;behind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>
&gt;weren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>
&gt;because the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>

ever going to be able to solve. The next-generation of MMORPG&#39;s should deal<br/>
with this nicely. Hero&#39;s Journey springs to mind as one example, they have<br/>
the ability to add entire new dungeons in a matter of a week or two, and can<br/>
add to the world limitlessly. EQ is plenty of fun for now though, I&#39;m glad<br/>
it came out when it did.<br/>
