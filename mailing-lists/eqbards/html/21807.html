<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634253425">At 01:44 PM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>

&gt;real answer other than &quot;we&#39;ll look into it at some point&quot; and &quot;working as<br/>
&gt;intended&quot;.  I know if I ever saw real progress on these issues I&#39;d be the<br/>
&gt;first to say wtg!  Anyone who is familiar with my opinions on trade skills<br/>

 </span></blockquote>why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and expecting<br/>
the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t like it, <br/>
don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a waste<br/>
of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.</div>
