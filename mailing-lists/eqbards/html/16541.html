&gt; Coward code means they don&#39;t attack<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; During beta EVERYTHING attacked, regardless of your level.  In Guk/Cazic etc<br/>
&gt; after a certain point you can waltz by the entry area things that would<br/>
&gt; normally attack someone MUCH lower.  And run, then cause trains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Coward code prevents this by keeping ultra-green mobs from attacking anyone<br/>
&gt; X levels above them.  Any mob above 20th is immune to coward code, however,<br/>
&gt; and will attack anyway (dungeons were too easy or something).<br/>

you were referring to code that caused green mobs to flee at<br/>
half hp:<br/>
