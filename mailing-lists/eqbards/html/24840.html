<div id="ygrps-yiv-969595027">In regards to Stats; I dont play a bard, however I do play an enchanter and<br/>
we have some spells with similar results and we are the only two classes<br/>
that use Charisma as a primary/secondary stat (I know shamans do to but what<br/>
a scam, lol)  I have done a good bit of testing on my own (mezzing a guard<br/>
over and over for nearly a day and a half, prob 16 to 20 hours RL) with my<br/>
70 base charisma and then again with 200+ charisma. I dont have all the<br/>
figures here, I am at Sea for a few months, but the results were very<br/>
disappointing in the fact that charisma seemed to make very little<br/>
difference (was a few % points but less than 5%).  Charm however is a<br/>
different story but for mez spells I found it not to be worth it to worry<br/>
too much about charisma.  Not sure if Bard songs are as broken as Enchanter<br/>
mez&#39;s when it comes to the fact of Charisma meaning next to nothing.  <br/>

BTW Anyone know why they list Dex as a necessary stat for Necros?<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Nope, I&#39;m afraid dual wield doesn&#39;t enable you to use a weap and an <br/>
instrument at the same time. I&#39;m level 50 and still haven&#39;t maxed out my <br/>
hand to hand, it&#39;s pretty pathetic. I&#39;m sure other bards have, however.<br/>
<br/>
Song weaving should be done at level 2. At that point you should be weaving <br/>
Chant of Battle with Chords of Dissonance.<br/>
<br/>
At level 12, in a group, you could be weaving Anthem de Arms, Chords of <br/>
Dissonance and Hymn of Restoration (depending on your situation). It&#39;s been <br/>
a long time since I was level 12, however, perhaps someone else has better <br/>
advice as far as song selection. Consider Bellow as bard&#39;s kick. Very <br/>
useful, especially if you&#39;re solo, but if you&#39;re in a group just weigh <br/>
whether the few extra points of damage is more useful than buffing your <br/>
entire party.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the last person to recommend any particular stats and don&#39;t really have <br/>
a strong opinion about &#39;em. I would think that CHA affects your ability to <br/>
Lament creatures. CHA becomes much more important when you gain the ability <br/>
to Pixie Strike or Charm creatures. I&#39;ve valued STR, but only because I&#39;m <br/>
lugging half my house with me due to working on tradeskills of some sort, <br/>
so while not overly important to the usual bard, it&#39;s important to me. :-)<br/>
