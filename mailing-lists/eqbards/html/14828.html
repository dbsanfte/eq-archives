<div id="ygrps-yiv-871969308"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Add to that resistances.  I&#39;ve kept psalm of vitality mem&#39;d in hate<br/>
&gt; because so many mobs disease (I felt bad having to ask for a cure after<br/>
&gt; nearly every fight).  This for single mob pulls, and when I start getting<br/>
&gt; attention I stop attacking for a few rounds.  If more than one comes in,<br/>
&gt; songs go by the wayside.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s true, I will put in a little +dis or +pois, however I find<br/>
  resist line spells work well enough.  I wish those Psalms had<br/>
  a dmg shield and a different color tint.  For curing in Hate it&#39;s<br/>
  useful, I agree.  But I&#39;m not usually hanging out in hate these<br/>
  days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest peeve with the 50 song is that the message is exactly the same<br/>
&gt; as Chant of Battle.  I usually pick what to weave next from the last<br/>
&gt; message I see, and this makes it rather difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yep, tough see when to twist chant in, so I just rarely do it.<br/>
  Maybe we suggest that the message changes, even something generic<br/>
  like &#39;You feel victorious.&#39;<br/>
