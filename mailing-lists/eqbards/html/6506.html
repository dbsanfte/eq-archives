<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083990222">I have heard about the Pumice stone dispelling buffs but I have never used<br/>
it myself or witnessed anyone ever using it before.  Where can you find/buy<br/>
them at?  Also, do they dispel both positive and negative buffs or only<br/>
negative buffs?  If they only dispel negative buffs, I wouldn&#39;t think they<br/>
would cancel SOW since the game classifies that as a positive buff.  Can you<br/>
provide more info on how pumice works?<br/>
<br/>
I love this list.  Learn something new every day:-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When a kiter is hassling you, get some pumice and haul it around with you,<br/>
&gt; it has effect of dispell. So if a druid sow&#39;s you you can remove it. Or<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; better if he for instance is kiting a giant, he&#39;s using sow, and his giant<br/>
&gt; is snared, dispell them both and watch him get out of this one, this has<br/>
&gt; been very usefull for us when a couple of high level shamans tried to<br/>
&gt; steal<br/>
&gt; our very nasty named hill giant once. (Brood Bloodbeard). </span></blockquote></div>
