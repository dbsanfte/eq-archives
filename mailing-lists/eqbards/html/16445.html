<div id="ygrps-yiv-589116947">Doh your right, I forgot about my lute :)  Actually I wanted to bow out of<br/>
the glove lotto, but Myth jumped the gun and lotto&#39;d before I could say so.<br/>
Regardless they should have gone to Avon with out a lotto, as it was the<br/>
last next to last piece she needed for a full set.<br/>
<br/>
The outfit that got me the most inspections/tells was full steel.  It is a<br/>
great look on wood elves.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night in PoA I had one of my guild members ask me to put on my<br/>
plane<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor so they could take a screen shot (my current look is all black<br/>
plate).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I sadly informed her my only piece of plane equipment (after nearly 2<br/>
months<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 46+) is my Six Note Blade.  She was apalled :)<br/>

You forgot your lute, and you did pass on the gloves since you<br/>
already had gauntlets of fiery might.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m working on my full black plate too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I guess you could go with azure sleeves and bracers that were silver.<br/>
&gt;   Ugh, then I&#39;d look like a freakin dark paladin ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We were trying to get one of the lower level paladins in our<br/>
guild out of bronze, and tossed a bunch of miscellaneous armor<br/>
onto him.  He ended up with a steel BP, steel arms, silver<br/>
plated bracers, charred boots, and black chitin leggings.  He<br/>
looks like he walked out of a tuxedo shop.  He says he&#39;s never<br/>
been inspected so much in his life.  It&#39;s a nice look for<br/>
formal events like weddings, or if you want to avoid the dark<br/>
paladin look.<br/>
