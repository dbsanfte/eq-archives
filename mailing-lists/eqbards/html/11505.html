only works like a (very) reduced aggro radius, or depends on<br/>
direction (like sneak).  I never got a chance to experiment<br/>
with it much because by the time the defenders wouldn&#39;t beat<br/>
me silly, I was high enough level that the effect seemed to go<br/>
away, and invis has been reliable ever since.<br/>
