<div id="ygrps-yiv-824562257"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; &gt; I really think your connection speed is playing a huge factor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in this.  How the h*ll does a bard die 4 times in one night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; passing through outdoor zones?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You&#39;ve obviously never met Chief Goonda and tried to recover<br/>
&gt; &gt;your corpse from his &quot;range of aggrivation&quot;. If you read my<br/>
&gt; &gt;example closely, you&#39;ll note that only the first pass was my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;run through the zone&quot;. The others were me trying to recover<br/>
&gt; &gt;my corpse from a spot surrounded by pissed off Ogre&#39;s. I even<br/>
&gt; &gt;had invisibility cast on me by the only player willing to help<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the zone. They saw through it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chief Goonda, man do I how him a dozen or so deaths.  Me and <br/>
&gt; a group of friends foolishly tried to take on that ogre camp<br/>
&gt; one night and then spent the next 4 hours getting all of our<br/>
&gt; corpses back :)  And this was when shamans still had charm.<br/>
&gt; I died 4 times that night, ick.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye. I conned them all warmly. Of course, from where I was,<br/>
Chief Goonda was standing behind the temple and I didn&#39;t see<br/>
him to con him. I was wondering why Ogre&#39;s conned warmly to<br/>
me - figured there had to be something there so I ran up<br/>
to one.<br/>
<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</div>
