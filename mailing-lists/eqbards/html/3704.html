I think you are setting your sights a little high for your level. At around<br/>
13-14 the plat starts rolling in. Not pouring in mind you, but you can make<br/>
a good 5-10 plat a night.<br/>

Hang in there!<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; and sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>
&gt;&gt; getting drunk anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my views here (still off topic, but all us Bards seem to dabble in<br/>
&gt;trade skills anyway):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>
&gt;enough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>
&gt;work on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>
&gt;good then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started out cooking, and what did I find?  Not only did the food sell<br/>
&gt;poorly, but that most players only eat bread because it&#39;s the cheapest<br/>
&gt;thing to get from the merchants.  Hmmm...ok, so I can only cook for<br/>
&gt;myself effectively then (and at a loss--but I can always hope that<br/>
&gt;cooking will mean something in the future).  I&#39;m up to 24 or so in skill<br/>
&gt;now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Next skill, tailoring.  Here&#39;s something that actually makes a little<br/>
&gt;money.  At least enough to pay for the patterns (since I hunt my own<br/>
&gt;skins).  But what did I find?  No market--everyone wants banded armor.<br/>
&gt;Patchwork is useless except for the lowest levels, and most of them<br/>
&gt;either ignore auction, or have already got what they wan.  Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt;making enough off of the merchants to at least get somewhere.  Up to 21<br/>
&gt;in this skill and seeming to be stuck there (still get alot of failures<br/>
&gt;and I can&#39;t do studded yet).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Time for blacksmithing to learn to at least make the studs for my<br/>
&gt;tailoring skill.  As far as I&#39;m concern, this is a complete loss for<br/>
&gt;now...the cash I spent on it set me back as a tailor because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;afford the patterns for the longest time.  Although I was able to get<br/>
&gt;studs made up with a little patience.  Skill here, about 18.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, finally despairing over getting enough cash to even _think_ about<br/>
&gt;affording banded armor, let alone getting a magical weapon (yeah, I am<br/>
&gt;still using my Mino), I turned to brewing.  Even figured out some of the<br/>
&gt;recipes without spoilers (though I turned to those after a while), and<br/>
&gt;found that it was even worse than cooking.  I lost even more cash at this<br/>
&gt;than I did at cooking (though blacksmithing cost me even more).  I even<br/>
&gt;got up to 25 in brewing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, what does that leave?  Hmmm, I can spend several days fishing and<br/>
&gt;eventually I&#39;ll make enough plat to afford good armor.  Or I can keep<br/>
&gt;hunting lions, wolves, and bears in EC for tailoring, like I have been.<br/>
&gt;I was thinking of trying pottery, but in light of what I&#39;ve been hearing,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try to waste my money on that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Frankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>
&gt;handouts from higher level folks.  I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>
&gt;get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>
&gt;it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my 2 copper rant,<br/>
