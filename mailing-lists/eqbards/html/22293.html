<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688466429">I think this happens to any who uses an illusion effect (guises, wolf form,<br/>
enchanter spells, etc...) now.  I noticed my entire party was helmetless<br/>
when group wolf form wore off...<br/>
<br/>
ALso my guild&#39;s rogue is always an iksar, but he has no helmet graphic when<br/>
he becomes visible either.</div>
