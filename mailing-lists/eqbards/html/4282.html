<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050059878">This topic has come up at least 3 or 4 times, all results have come to the<br/>
same conclusion, jig has no effect on mana regen, it does affect the refresh<br/>
rate of your mana bar however, so it may appear to speed it up.  I find it<br/>
especially odd that you are saying an almost 20% increase, I think you<br/>
should maybe make sure you are timing the exact same amount of mana every<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful...<br/>
&gt;&gt;one of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;all three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6<br/>
&gt;&gt;sec/pulse.  So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana<br/>
&gt;&gt;regen<br/>
&gt;&gt;  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
&gt;&gt;- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should<br/>
&gt;&gt;increase at the<br/>
&gt;&gt;  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even<br/>
&gt;&gt;more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this<br/>
&gt;&gt;information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt;&gt;an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>
