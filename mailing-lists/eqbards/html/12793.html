Probably not.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Gak! I was just copying what was from the previous email. Just too busy to<br/>
&gt; keep up on the list and &quot;proofread&quot; previously written email. Oh well. Now<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have to go and apologize to my own Staff of Writhing for the blunder. I<br/>
&gt; wonder if he&#39;ll still smile at me like he always does. :-)<br/>
