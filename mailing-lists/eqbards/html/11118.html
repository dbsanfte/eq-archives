&gt; I agree, root cuts out SoW and Selo&#39;s (if you cut the song), so why should <br/>
&gt; SoW and Selo&#39;s not cut out root? The dread wolves use some steal str that <br/>
&gt; cuts out any str enhancer, and any str enahncer cuts out the steal str. Going <br/>
&gt; by what Maev said, people using spirit of the bear or whatever to combat that <br/>
&gt; are exploiting! My! They should be banned on the spot! How dare they!???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dispite your hysterical tone, it is quite likely that Verant would<br/>
consider this exploiting a side effect of their whacky spell interaction<br/>
problems. Smedley himself even called feign pulling an exploit. And it&#39;s<br/>
pretty obvious from the problems we&#39;ve seen since day one with bard song<br/>
interaction with spells that their spell/song interaction code is a<br/>
mess. Look at the half ass solution they finally came up with for the<br/>
Selo&#39;s/SoW interaction problems.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you look at the way cancel magic/nullify magic work, it seems<br/>
quite evident that they don&#39;t want you to be able to just instantly<br/>
cancel a harmful spell with another spell. Further evidence of this is<br/>
the removal of pillage enchantment from pumice stones, The way all these<br/>
spells work is basically the same way ADM is working now, removing<br/>
harmful or helpful buffs at random, with nullify removing 2 or 3 so<br/>
your chances of getting the harmful one are increased.<br/>
<br/>
As to a Verant employee saying it was intended, I think the only place<br/>
I&#39;ve seen any comment on Selo&#39;s and root was from J.M. Cappozi on this<br/>
list and he never claimed to be a Verant employee, as we discussed a<br/>
short while back, he was promoted to that status by a few people on this<br/>
list because of his appearant insider knowledge of how some internals<br/>
worked.<br/>
