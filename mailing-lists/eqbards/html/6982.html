<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264698171">Now that would be one useful song.  It would also eliminate the disadvantage<br/>
of not being able to bind.  <br/>
<br/>
I can fully understand why Verant and a lot of people on this list do not<br/>
think we need bind.  From a class balancing point of view, I agree with this<br/>
view.  But from a real world point of view, I really wish Verant would do<br/>
something that allowed non-casters to get bound in non-cities.  That would<br/>
make me fat, dumb, and happy.  I am a casual gamer who works full time and<br/>
has a wife who hates this game.  If I&#39;m lucky, I get to play for 1-2 hours a<br/>
night (once or twice during the week) and maybe 4-5 hours over the weekend.<br/>
When I do get to play, I want to spend my time adventuring, not running<br/>
across four zones to retrieve my corpse.  I realize bards do this faster but<br/>
it can still take a long time if I am far away from a city.  If I die, my EQ<br/>
session for that day (unless it is a weekend) is pretty much over.  By the<br/>
time I get to my corspe, I usually have to log out for the night.  If Verant<br/>
included a bind point somewhere in each zone where melee types could get<br/>
bound, I&#39;m certain the other casual gamers who fall into my category sure<br/>
would be happy.  IMO, I do not see how this would affect class balancing in<br/>
any way.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I say - forget binds - bind in a bank - close to ur spares.  Bards really<br/>
&gt; NEED a song like:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ramundo&#39;s Recitement of Revival  Skill: singing Target: self  Mana: 100%<br/>
&gt; (usable only 1 per game day)  sold in Erudin  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is totally in keeping with the bardic image - we all die A LOT!~ And<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; lev 14 have considerable practice in finding r corpses and getting r<br/>
&gt; stuffs<br/>
&gt; back.  So, now its time to lighten the load some and get us start getting<br/>
&gt; used to the fact that some high 40 song will burn mana too.  Also, finally<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; use for all that clarity I get casted on me.  Now this should not be a get<br/>
&gt; out of jail free card but function like the Cleric&#39;s revive/resuss - you<br/>
&gt; come back to ur corpse and are staggering all over with no<br/>
&gt; str/sta/agi/dex.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sylly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; p.s. this started out as a joke but it is sounding better and better to<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
