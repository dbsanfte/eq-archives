<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178403020">I know you have probably discussed charm kiting numerous times on this list,<br/>
but not since I&#39;ve been getting the list. I was wondering if someone would be<br/>
good enough to tell me how to go about charm kiting and ny thing else I might<br/>
need to know to make my nifty new charm song do all it should be able to do. I<br/>
finially got lvl 27 night before last and don&#39;t have a clue where to start.<br/>
Thank you in advance:) Oh and you can send it to me in email if you want:)<br/>
