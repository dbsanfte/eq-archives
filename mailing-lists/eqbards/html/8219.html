<div id="ygrps-yiv-983963221">Weird, I am definitely a weakling str-wise (89) now , 73 back then.  I was<br/>
using warsong and chant so it was maybe what 90 something?  I&#39;d hit for 5 a<br/>
lot but 6 or 7 was max I&#39;m pretty sure.  I haven&#39;t used h2h since though so<br/>
I have no idea what it would be now if I could even hit anything.  I do seem<br/>
to remember that some wisps were only yellow to me at 9th, but most were<br/>
still red.  My record keeping then was pretty sloppy though so I&#39;m not 100%<br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by then<br/>
and dual wield?  If so even at dmg 2 they&#39;d be the equivalent of 5/25 or so<br/>
which is a combine scimmy.  I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon until 13th level<br/>
and that was a dirk at 25p.  I couldn&#39;t have afforded a combine back then<br/>
because I was too busy having fun to make money ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d have to totally and completely disagree.  At 10th level wisps are<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; red even the monk will lose.<br/>
<br/>
My monk killed his first wisp at level 9, barely.  It was<br/>
yellow to him.  Mend worked successfully, and he was able to<br/>
win with a bubble of health remaining.  I know it&#39;s level 9<br/>
because I retired him immediately after reaching level 10.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; At 13-14 though they still provide xp, some<br/>
&gt; con blue, and a melee type with h2h maxed could beat one.  I could beat<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; at 14th with just bellow and at the same time could punch normal critters<br/>
&gt; for around the same damage 7-8 points.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  What&#39;s your strength?  I didn&#39;t start punching for 7<br/>
damage until about level 30.  And I&#39;ve only seen punches for 8<br/>
recently, since level 34 or 35.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would doubt that a 13th level<br/>
&gt; warrior would have trouble beating a wisp with his fists if they could hit<br/>
&gt; magical critters.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors don&#39;t get Bellow.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
A typical melee person at that level is using a fine steel or<br/>
combine weapon (I bought my combine longsword at level 12).<br/>
That is 6/28 vs. 2/35 for punching.  Weapons are nearly four<br/>
times more effective.  Put another way, a non-monk melee<br/>
person will take nearly 4 times as much damage fighting a<br/>
creature h2h compared to fighting an equivalent non-magic mob<br/>
with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the reason, I don&#39;t think wisps were behind it.<br/>
