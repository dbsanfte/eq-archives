Subject: [eqbards] Walrus Skin Drum<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who got one in SG - and is willing to give me a deal on<br/>
discounted &quot;going&quot; rate.  Note to non-Xegony Bards - Xegony prices tend to<br/>
run on the high side...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably into gear less than a lot of people - and the drum seems only<br/>
to be marginally better than my current Nestrolo Tambourine - so I it&#39;s not<br/>
worth it to me to tap myself out (on the one hand) - but I would like to<br/>
fairly compensate my friend if I take her up on the deal.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s done some preliminary asking around the server and got a range of<br/>
9-20K.  The high end sounds ridiculous to me - I can&#39;t imagine paying 20K<br/>
for a Selo&#39;s Drum which is a lot better (however I think there is a lot of<br/>
confusion between the Walrus Skin drum and the Drum of the Beast - ie people<br/>
think the Walrus Skin drum is better than Selo&#39;s) And it&#39;s probably very<br/>
rare at the moment since prior to the last patch - basically no one hunted<br/>
in SG.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I wondering what you Xegony folks think a fair (normal<br/>
non-discounted) price range would be for this item.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
