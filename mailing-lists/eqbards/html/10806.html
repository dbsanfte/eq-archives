<div id="ygrps-yiv-162968159">I was given a lambent stone and am thinking about getting a <br/>
Darkwood staff with it. I am level 10 and a magical weapon<br/>
would allow me to kill wisps while I can get experience off<br/>
of them!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, since a magical instrument still seems a ways away.<br/>
Will my damage songs damage the wisps without one? <br/>
HOw about if I have magical gloves and not magical instrument<br/>
Anything?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>
