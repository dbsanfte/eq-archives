<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122253995">Could be you just have a busier crushbone than I usually see.  I generally<br/>
have about 15 people in Crushbone when I was there, though I have seen 50 or<br/>
so.  With only 15 people, and 8 of those camping the throneroom, the orc<br/>
population fills the place.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if you&#39;e seen the breakdown on crushbone that talks about the<br/>
&quot;two Crushbones&quot;  one empty with occasional death trains, and the other very<br/>
populous with wandering legionnaires or not, but it is highly accurate of<br/>
what I&#39;ve seen.  I usually end up with the latter and the two wandering<br/>
patrols of 6 Cents and 2 Legionnaires total would be disastrous to have walk<br/>
in and get agro, the 2 legos I can handle, adding the 6 cents is suicide.<br/>
<br/>
	&#39;Just my 6 cents worth&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Strange, Kitasi, I hunt in Crushbone a lot, and while I&#39;m careful to keep<br/>
an eye on what&#39;s around me, I frequently will stand next to a mass-melee<br/>
with the Lullaby going, just to irritate the orcs ;)  While I often end up<br/>
with 4-8 angry orcs on me, it&#39;s never more than I saw (they don&#39;t &quot;come out<br/>
of the woodwork&quot;) and usually I don&#39;t have any real problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what I&#39;m doing differently?<br/>
