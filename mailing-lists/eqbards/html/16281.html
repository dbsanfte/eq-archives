<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047139322">That&#39;s silly.  On Fennin Ro (crowded as hell) the King/Priest/Champ are all<br/>
three different groups.  Always.  The fact that a group came in and started<br/>
camping the Priest when the Champ room felt like King/Priest/Champ were all<br/>
theirs are simply wrong.  This would *never* fly on Fennin Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Now on Druzzil Ro, with the Sol B population at 20 or 30, sometimes the<br/>
King/Priest/Champ is all one camp, but having come from Fennin, no one is<br/>
shocked when others come in and set up camp.  Normally a King/Priest/Champ<br/>
group will base itself in the King room so that is this happens they still<br/>
get the primo camp.<br/>
