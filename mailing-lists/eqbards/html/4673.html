&lt;&lt; he main trick for doing this is to setup a bank of quick-keys (click and<br/>
 hold the mouse button and drag it to a quick key slot) and use the 1-6 keys<br/>
 not mouse clicks to switch between the songs.  There seems to be some delay<br/>
 involved with the mouse click - so you can&#39;t &quot;Riff&quot; (my preferred term) as<br/>
 well no matter how quick you are at clicking that mice. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Ahh :) Thanks for taking the time to respond. I know it gets tedious <br/>
answering the same questions over and over again and I should have let you <br/>
know I&#39;m very experienced in the game overall, so all you would have had to <br/>
type was..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;use hotkeys for the songs, there&#39;s some kind of delay involved with the <br/>
mouse clicks. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again :)<br/>
