Okay - I&#39;ve been digging deep, and this is what I&#39;ve dredged up:<br/>
<br/>
Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike:<br/>
A lot of you have noticed that you get resist after resist with Pixie <br/>
Strike, until it &quot;takes&quot; - then it suddenly works over and over (ditto with <br/>
Charm?)  Weeeeeelll - apparently, an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; of those two <br/>
songs is a slight magic resistance debuff.<br/>
<br/>
Guardian Rhythms only purpose is in twisting multiple songs in the Rhythms <br/>
lines, and ONLY if you are already twisting the other two.  It gives the <br/>
same AC and MR bonus as Purifying and Elemental, but without anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Vitality appears to have a slight disease-removal effect.  Purity <br/>
seems to remove poison, and<br/>
<br/>
Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant only does 1/4th the damage of the Discord, but it <br/>
DOES have a better MR Debuff.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth gives Infravision, Cooling gives Ultravision.<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Dissension is a mana-debuff, but since NPC&#39;s don&#39;t USE mana, it&#39;s <br/>
utterly useless.<br/>
<br/>
Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame/Frost supplements it&#39;s weak damage by adding a <br/>
Fire/Cold resistance debuff (So theoretically, they&#39;ll take more damage if <br/>
they resist less?  Stick with Denon&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
Syvelian&#39;s is exactly the same as Alenia&#39;s as far as the data file is <br/>
concerned (except for the material component in Alenia&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Shielding seems to have an unknown effect, as well as a DoT <br/>
effect.  How strange.<br/>
<br/>
Niv&#39;s, from the looks of the effects will add a rune-like coat of <br/>
protection, as well as healing, AND giving you an HP buff AND a decent STR <br/>
buff.  Wow!! Nice song (if it works...)<br/>
<br/>
Chord&#39;s of Cessation adds a damage effect to it&#39;s slow-down, however, it&#39;s <br/>
slow-down is no more powerful than the Chains.  If anything, it&#39;s worse <br/>
than chains, because while they both slow down attacks, only chains slows <br/>
movement.<br/>
<br/>
And man - I can&#39;t wait for Verses of Victory (level 50) That is one SWEET <br/>
song ;)<br/>
