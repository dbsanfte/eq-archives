<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182453464">Well I didn&#39;t mean playing the hymm song was sad, but thinking that is the<br/>
best song you can offer your party at that level is sad (and not twisting it<br/>
with anything else).   I am only a level 7 bard and I hardly ever use hymm<br/>
during battle, even when I am soloing.  Discord does better twisted with the<br/>
Warsong for me, even if multiple mobs come at me, I&#39;ll usually switch to<br/>
twisting accelerando and hymm until I am healed enough to take the other<br/>
ones.<br/>

&gt; I have a question.  I am currently lvl 25 and the 3 songs that I twist<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; I am in a group in High Keep are Anthem, Psalm of Warmth, and healing.  I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; usually group with people who are lvl 28-33 in there killing raiders and<br/>
&gt; warriors (non-magic users).  I cannot think of any other song in my<br/>
&gt; inventory that I can used except for these 3.  Any other song has no<br/>
&gt; effect<br/>
&gt; on them.  Since these post mention that a lvl 20 playing a hymn song is<br/>
&gt; sad<br/>
&gt; can you all tell me what other song that I can play to improve my group?<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think the song that a bard use depends on the situation.  That is one of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; unique thing about being a bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thnx for all the info,<br/>
