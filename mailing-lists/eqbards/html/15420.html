Watchman&#39;s Boots Quest...<br/>
Starts with Narron Jenork in the Ak&#39;anon Warrior&#39;s Guild.  If you have good <br/>
enough faction with the Gemchoppers, you should be able to follow the trail...<br/>

Narron sends you after Watchman Dexlin, who spawns on the second floor in <br/>
the North Karana stone bridge tower.  Bilbis Briar is his <br/>
placeholder.  Watchman Dexlin is a somewhat rare spawn.   Dexlin wants you <br/>
to kill tiny skeletons, and fill a tin box with their bones (undead <br/>
brownies, apparently).  Turning in the combined box to Dexlin gives you <br/>
faction and experience, and he directs you to instead take the box back to <br/>
Narron Jenork.  Narron rewards you with 4 platinum, faction changes, <br/>
experience, and Watchman Boots (Magic Item, Lore Item, AC 5, +5 STA, 1 <br/>
charge SoW, Wearable by all races, all non-pure-casters)<br/>
<br/>
Not as good as journeyman boots, but maybe still useful...<br/>
