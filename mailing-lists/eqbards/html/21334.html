No - there really is no solution because in order to mimic society, there <br/>
have to be social restraints - since people don&#39;t feel they &quot;have&quot; to <br/>
behave online, those social restraints are missing.<br/>
Thus, either we have grief-pk&#39;rs waiting to exploit the system, or a <br/>
totally non-pvp scenario, which has the feeling of &quot;plasticity&quot;, or <br/>
non-reality.<br/>
<br/>
I had actually come up with an idea on it, but it also occurs to me that <br/>
we&#39;ve spent an awful long time on this offtopic discussion.  I suggest that <br/>
those of us dedicated to some form of &quot;PVP&quot; ideas congregate on the <br/>
Horizon&#39;s message boards (which David DOES read), and leave the ideas.<br/>
