&gt;At your levels - what are you guys doing when in combat with your party?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you equiped and in the melee?  If so, don&#39;t you get stunned and have<br/>
&gt;your songs stopped?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or are you standing off with an instrument and playing for extra party<br/>
&gt;effect?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On another note...<br/>
&gt;I was in a real bad melee last night - me and my enchanter friend. An<br/>
&gt;icey-boney skelly comes by and we attack it.  A snow lepoard and an Orc <br/>
&gt;join<br/>
&gt;the melee.  The icey is about a bub more hp than either me or my friend and<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s hitting on me.  My friends hp drops a half a bub lower than mine. And<br/>
&gt;we are both real low.  So, I decided to gamble and equip my lute - I <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt;am trying desparately to keep the song going between interupts.  The<br/>
&gt;icey-boney keeps hitting on me and finally slays me.  My friend&#39;s pet <br/>
&gt;killed<br/>
&gt;the lep and she killed the icey and mezzed the Orc and escapes with 4 hp<br/>
&gt;left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does it ever help to equip lute for hp if you are getting hit on by strong<br/>
&gt;mobs?<br/>

Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (I know you are two levels away from it &lt;grin&gt;), here <br/>
is a little story about how this song saved me and my parties butts in a big <br/>
way.  We were deep in Najena taking on one of the goblin camps in there.  <br/>
Well the opening blast from the goblin casters shreded us pretty good.  <br/>
Every one in the party was down below half health and one of our rangers was <br/>
already dead.  In desperation I equiped my lute and started playing the <br/>
Lullaby.  I immediately started directing the battle getting everyone to <br/>
focus on one goblin at a time, all the while keeping the Lullaby going. Our <br/>
paladin starts to fade out of the battle (no red showing on his health bar <br/>
and lay on hands was already been used on me) so I hit him with my squad <br/>
ring to give him a chance to cast a heal or two on himself.  All the while I <br/>
am on the edge of my seat sweating bullets, the goblins are falling one by <br/>
one, the party is rotating damage, everyone is down to 1 1/2 bubbles.  One <br/>
goblin left and the whole party is down to one bubble or less, I switch to <br/>
healing to keep up going for the final push, and the final lone goblin <br/>
falls. Man what a battle! Other then the one ranger that fell at the <br/>
begining we are all alive (barely). One of the best battles I have ever been <br/>
in :)<br/>
