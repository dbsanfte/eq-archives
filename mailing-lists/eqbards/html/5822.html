Went up to Unrest 2 days ago.  My first time and all I gotta say is: WOW!<br/>
After hours and hours of slow camps in HighKeep and elsewhere, this place is<br/>
crazy!  Our group was 16 to 22 in levs - ya 16 is pretty rough for what we<br/>
were doing - stand at the wall and pull from the back and side doors.  But<br/>
hey - he was gittin xp off the death beetles that inevitably join any fight.<br/>
And we wanted ghouls and dry bone skels.<br/>
<br/>
You NEED combat healers to do any good in here.  You also need to RUN when<br/>
you get overwhelmed by a bad pull or some body else&#39;s train.  And you need<br/>
to chill about trains.  This place is Grand Central Station.<br/>
<br/>
I got a bub of xp with an inexperienced - not so well balanced group last<br/>
night and it was exciting as anything I have seen since BlackBurrow Paw when<br/>
I was younger.<br/>
<br/>
Ya, I&#39;m hooked!  See ya in Unrest!<br/>
