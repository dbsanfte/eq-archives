<div id="ygrps-yiv-995847387">I know for certain that the messages for both songs appeared, i.e. &quot;you feel<br/>
protected from cold&quot;.  Can&#39;t confirm if the mob was actually taking damage<br/>
from both of them though.  Its hard to track all the messages that scroll<br/>
through in a combat so when I got the confirmation that the song went into<br/>
affect, just assumed that the mob was getting burned/frozen.  Sure wish we<br/>
got the white text message for our damage shields similar to what you get<br/>
when you have the druid thorn buff (not certain of exact name).  With the<br/>
thorn buff, it tells you how much non-melee damage the mob took when they<br/>
hit you.  Anyone have an idea why we don&#39;t get a similar message?  <br/>

&gt; &gt; To recap, here is what I know about our resist buffs songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  Elemental and Purifying rhythms do not stack together<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2)  Guardian Rhythms will stack with Elemental or Purifying.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Need to confirm:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  Do the rhythm series songs stack with the Psalm series?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guardian Rhythms stack with Psalm of Warmth, Cooling, and<br/>
&gt; Vitality.  I haven&#39;t tested it with Purity or Mystic<br/>
&gt; Shielding.  The Psalm series does not stack with any other<br/>
&gt; Rhythm song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was unable to get Psalm of Warmth and Cooling to<br/>
&gt; stack.  When your friend and you did it, did you get both<br/>
&gt; damage shields (10 points/hit at your level)?  Or did they<br/>
&gt; cancel each other out since one burns the opponent while the<br/>
&gt; other chills it?<br/>
