&gt; You being the cleric guy, how do you feel about magicians having better<br/>
&gt; healing spells for their pets than clerics do for others now?  I cannot<br/>
&gt; fathom this change personally, it seems to be incredibly anti-group<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good of you to remember.  But things change.  I haven&#39;t played my cleric in<br/>
2 months.  I&#39;m spending most of my time on my mage (lvl 12) or necro (lvl<br/>
9).  If you can&#39;t beat them, join&#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
As to mage&#39;s healing pets, I don&#39;t think clerics have any problem with it.<br/>
Mages can only heal their pets, nothing else.  It&#39;s difficult for a cleric<br/>
to monitor a pet&#39;s hp.  Plus a cleric has enough to heal usually.<br/>
<br/>
From the mage&#39;s perspective, healing pets is not that great.  Even the<br/>
highest level pet can be summoned for 200 mana.  Spending 100 mana (20th lvl<br/>
heal) to heal a bubble may be a waste when a fully fresh pet is only 200<br/>
mana.  And pets heal naturally much faster than players, nearly as fast as<br/>
mana regen rate, making healing less needed.<br/>
<br/>
As to the anti-group oriented nature, mages also got the &quot;mana stone<br/>
replacement&quot;.  It is far from actually being a summoned mana stone, but with<br/>
the new ban of mana stones on the planes, people might find them useful.<br/>
Time will tell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But to tie this back to Bards, how do Bards feel about not being able to<br/>
affect party pets?  Other classes can buff, heal, and improve pets.  Bards<br/>
seem left out in this ability.<br/>
