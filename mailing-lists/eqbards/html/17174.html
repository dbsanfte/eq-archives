<div id="ygrps-yiv-967749977">I&#39;ll resist the temptation to tell you to get yourself some new friends and<br/>
instead suggest you work out a strategy with them where someone else takes<br/>
the initial damage (the cleric, if it&#39;s just you a cleric and an enchanter)<br/>
then you kick in your mega-taunting Hymn and taunt it off.  Maybe then no<br/>
one will die, or at least death won&#39;t be predetermined.<br/>
<br/>
The only other option I see for you, other than getting yourself some new<br/>
friends, which I won&#39;t say, is to take Rokenn&#39;s advice and go solo for a<br/>
while.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
