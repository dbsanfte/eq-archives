&gt;<br/>
&gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
&gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>
&gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>
&gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
&gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
&gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Strategies:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of<br/>
&gt;   the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and<br/>
&gt;   Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn&#39;t work through walls<br/>
&gt;   anymore.  Once you&#39;re dragged up, you have walls on both sides so<br/>
&gt;   you won&#39;t teleport anywhere.  Still, it&#39;s worth a shot, especially<br/>
&gt;   if you&#39;re not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure<br/>
&gt;   you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far<br/>
&gt;   enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone<br/>
&gt;   without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to<br/>
&gt;   start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same<br/>
&gt;   thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cautions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since everyone<br/>
&gt;   teleports to different locations.  Of course if that&#39;s your intent...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I&#39;ve teleported right<br/>
&gt;   into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying<br/>
&gt;   to get a friend unstuck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>
&gt;   means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>
&gt;   easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>
&gt;   make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water.<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Question about the teleport song<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tested it from the top floor.  You appear on the ground some distance<br/>
&gt; away. The song takes 5 seconds to &quot;re-act&quot; so if you plan to use it &quot;plan<br/>
&gt; ahead&quot; Ie: don&#39;t wait until someone is at a sliver of hp - it takes 5<br/>
&gt; seconds (2 good rounds of Avo attacks) for the song to stick.  The down<br/>
side<br/>
&gt; is the party members will be spread out and somewhat disoriented - so<br/>
brief<br/>
&gt; them ahead of time and even test it for fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But having been camping KFC (so delete me) for more levels than I care to<br/>
&gt; admit, I can now run to the top floor - with Selo&#39;s and the drum and pull<br/>
&gt; birds without a problem.  The first time I went up there - I fell to my<br/>
&gt; death just being disoriented and missing the small ramp.  Practice,<br/>
&gt; practice, practice!  Now (or even 2 levels ago - prolly around 25) I can<br/>
&gt; jump off the top floor and live (I lose 3 bubbles of health though so its<br/>
&gt; not a viable option for pulling.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, if you move somewhere that causes the mob that is attacking you<br/>
&gt; &quot;pathing problems&quot; (ie it for some reason cannot find a good way to run<br/>
&gt; after you - like some people who try to &quot;safe zone&quot; or trap mobs against<br/>
&gt; terrain features) the mobs will now &quot;teleport&quot; to your immediate vicinity<br/>
&gt; and continue their attack.  So, if you Melfious Motion and evacuate - the<br/>
&gt; mobs will be along shortly - so you better immediately make tracks for the<br/>
&gt; zone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. aviaks are sometimes called &quot;chickens&quot; - you can guess why we call it<br/>
&gt; KFC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s.s. memorize this: /ooc Paw neg 3200 pos 800<br/>
&gt; (you will be typing that a lot if you hunt at Aviaks)<br/>

&gt; I was fighting last night at the top of the aviak village in<br/>
&gt; South Karana.<br/>
&gt; Fortunately everything went well and I never had to flee for<br/>
&gt; the zone border<br/>
&gt; to escape death.  Had I been forced to do so I probably<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; survived because of the numerous ramps you have to use to<br/>
&gt; get to the bottom<br/>
&gt; of the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time,<br/>
&gt; was wondering<br/>
&gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also found that, at least in Kithicor,  once in the water it would never<br/>
&gt; teleport me out. Ya it could have been a bad run on the number generator,<br/>
&gt; but in an hour or more of random teleports (*laughs*, so I was bored and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know I couldn&#39;t go through walls) once I hit the water I stayed.<br/>
&gt; Still, it might have been that wacky random number generator.<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: RE: RE: Why do the melee classes keep wanting Bind?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My load times are from 2-4 minutes usually more towards 2.  I have seen<br/>
&gt; people playin this game with load times of 5 minutes, but how they do it I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t imagine.  Those people actually have a far greater danger than you<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; and can often die trying to zone out of Grobb.  It isn&#39;t they won&#39;t live<br/>
&gt; with danger, its that for many the danger is far greater than for those<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; have DSL or better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also for most the danger is intolerable because a guard can kill them in 4<br/>
&gt; hits.  Many people don&#39;t go to Guk until they are far higher in level than<br/>
&gt; was really intended.  I haven&#39;t gotten too many trains there because the<br/>
&gt; blue froggies don&#39;t run they fight me till they die.  Its easy to snare<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; few that do run generally.  Convincing my groupmates who don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; Acellerando to go is very difficult though.<br/>

&gt; Sounds like you&#39;ve had some bad experiences in Grobb. My condolences. The<br/>
&gt; /quit does work, I have had to use it myself. My load times are fairly<br/>
fast,<br/>
&gt; so maybe that&#39;s the difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still consider binding in evil cities an option. Others don&#39;t because<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; choose not to play with that level of danger. That&#39;s alright, I respect<br/>
&gt; that. I just am tired of hearing melee classes whine that the ONLY way to<br/>
&gt; fight in Cazic or Guk is to be bound in Freeport and that they hate the<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; run back. It&#39;s not the ONLY way. It just may be the only way for some<br/>
&gt; individuals depending upon their danger tolerance level.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah that&#39;s a good one.  You don&#39;t get to hit /quit or any other command.<br/>
&gt; You die before you zone in on your client as you zone in on the server for<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bit before you appear on the client side.  All you see is a never ending<br/>
&gt; stream of Loading...Please wait messages. No command bar, no reports of<br/>
&gt; damage, no view of Grobb, nothing, period.  And your supposed safe spot<br/>
may<br/>
&gt; also be the real spot for a guard that&#39;s been trained temporarily<br/>
elsewhere<br/>
&gt; which is worse if you don&#39;t know it.  He then returns to his spot every<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; the server is reset, if he ever leaves it.  How do I know all this,<br/>
there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a lower level Kitasi on Solusek that was my first bard who listened to a<br/>
&gt; monk and got bound in Grobb.  Went from 12th to 9th before they lowered<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; death penalty before I realized it wasn&#39;t some glitch and reset my<br/>
computer.<br/>
&gt; Needless to say he hasn&#39;t seen any action since as I moved to a server<br/>
where<br/>
&gt; I had friends who could bind.  Also only the time alive counts towards the<br/>
&gt; 30seconds.  The time passing thru the Loading period doesn&#39;t so you die<br/>
&gt; however many times that guard can kill you before you react and cut the<br/>
&gt; connection plus the 30+ seconds of linkdead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kitasi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of<br/>
&gt; these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; a guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This<br/>
&gt; immediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait.<br/>
You<br/>
&gt; may need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before<br/>
&gt; reentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a<br/>
&gt; mule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy<br/>
territory.<br/>
&gt; But again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous.<br/>
Everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; personal limit of danger varies.<br/>

&gt; Thanks John.  Since I&#39;m gonna try my hat at soloing for a while, think I<br/>

teleport<br/>
&gt; the entire party to the same random location.  Do you guys think this is<br/>
&gt; something that we should ask Verant to consider changing somewhere down<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; road?  Since it would help the entire party, and doesn&#39;t impact solo play<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all, it shouldn&#39;t be a class balance issue.<br/>

&gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I sing that<br/>
song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while at the top of the village (or any high altitude location), will<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result take lots<br/>

&gt; Curious, will the teleport work thru doors that have a crack around the<br/>
&gt; opening?  Might be a way into huts that are broken or locked.  Might take<br/>

&gt; You can ask, but they won&#39;t change it.  In fact I don&#39;t think it should be<br/>
&gt; changed.  A lot of the bard songs are tweaked with some slight drawback<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; the caster&#39;s version of the same thing, and this is the way it needs to<br/>
be.<br/>
&gt; We can wait until everyone is called &quot;oom&quot; before we hit MMM and have a<br/>

and<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My point is that a class whose specialty is supposed to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing is better at combat than we are.  I suppose you could<br/>
&gt; &gt; argue that we&#39;re not supposed to be very good at combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; either, but still I&#39;d like to be better than the class whose<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose is anti-killing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [mini cleric topic]<br/>
&gt; Just to clear up any misconceptions here are the Cleric DD spells<br/>
&gt; Lvl - Dam/mana - Name<br/>
&gt; 1  - 10/12 - Strike<br/>
&gt; 5  - 19/20 - Furor<br/>
&gt; 14 - 83/70 - Smite<br/>
&gt; 29 - 200/145 - Wrath<br/>
&gt; 44 - 510/240 - Resolution<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see, these are some of the worst DD spells in the game.  And<br/>
&gt; after level 14, there is a 15 level gap before an improvement.  The levels<br/>
&gt; just before a spell upgrade are the hardest, as you are using spells from<br/>
14<br/>
&gt; levels ago.  I do believe that Clerics are positioned just about right for<br/>
&gt; DD spells, as they do have better defence compared to all other pure<br/>
&gt; casters.  There are some sweet spots just after they get a new spell where<br/>
&gt; they can solo somewhat, but there are dead spots where they are very<br/>
&gt; ineffective with DD spells.<br/>

&gt; Here was the original message I replied to:<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a result, [hybrids] get magic<br/>

&gt; &gt; other hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, instead of arguing about the battle worthness of a Bard I should have<br/>
&gt; just used your own argument against you.  The level 14 song was a pure<br/>
&gt; caster type song.  Only pure casters got the identify spell.  You felt<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; bards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>
&gt; from all other classes without binding.  I mean MAJOR UPROAR.  So it<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; matter what kind of Vulcan logic you use to argue that Bards need binding<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t happen.  Putting BardBind in your petition will do no good at all,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; probably cause Verant to not fully consider the rest of your petition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you need to ask for is to have all classes be able to bind anywhere<br/>
(or<br/>
&gt; maybe just Inns) they choose instead of just a city.  Verant is much more<br/>
&gt; likely to consider something that would be fair to all classes, and not<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; for Bards.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; row in one of these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and<br/>
&gt; &gt; are immediately attacked by a guard at your bind point, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to use the /quit command. This immediately exits you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know about you, but I know for a fact that you appear<br/>
&gt; on the other side of a zone or respawn before you&#39;re actually<br/>
&gt; given control of your character again. I&#39;ve had many a times<br/>
&gt; where I was zoning and could hear myself being attacked but<br/>
&gt; was still waiting for my screen to show me what was going on<br/>
&gt; and allow me to fight back. With guards and any character of<br/>
&gt; low level, a couple hits and you&#39;re dead before you even get<br/>
&gt; to see what happened, or type anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d still like to see how you expect to get past the Grobb<br/>
&gt; guards that sit outside the entrance in the first place. Let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; say you in fact are level 19 or higher and you have your invis<br/>
&gt; song. You get past the guards, get bound just inside the tunnel<br/>
&gt; and all is well. Now you&#39;re dead. You have no invis. You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go to the bank. Luckily no guards have been dragged to the zone<br/>
&gt; border. You have to figure out how to get past the<br/>
&gt; guards outside. How do you propose this is done?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mere fact that there would be a MAJOR UPROAR makes it obvious that not<br/>
&gt; being able to bind is a far more serious detriment than you would have us<br/>
&gt; believe.  Binding is bar-none the most powerful ability in the game,<br/>
period.<br/>
&gt; There is no ability that makes up for it nor any package of abilities that<br/>
&gt; does so balance-wise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.  Clerics and Shamans are hybrids<br/>
&gt; plain and simple.  Both can melee effectively at some levels and sit back<br/>
&gt; and cast at other levels.  Pure casters are never effective at melee.<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; are four Pure caster classes in this game.  Magician, Enchanter, Wizard,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Necromancer.  Clerics, Druids and Shamans are hybrids that lean heavily to<br/>
&gt; caster.  Shadowknights, Rangers, and Paladins are hybrids that lean<br/>
heavily<br/>
&gt; towards melee.  Balance would suggest that Bards are hybrids that lean<br/>
&gt; neither way.  We get the worst of both worlds for the most part.  The<br/>
lousy<br/>
&gt; defensive skills of the caster hybrids and the lousy offensive spells of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; melee hybrids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It takes a particular type of person to have fun playing a bard.  Bards<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; be fun to play, no doubt about it, but those who find them so, myself<br/>
&gt; included, would have fun playing a bard no matter what the abilities were<br/>
&gt; just because that&#39;s the type of people we are.  I&#39;d just like to be able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; have as much fun playing the class I am most attracted to as my friends do<br/>
&gt; playing the class they are most attracted to.  Right now, character<br/>
&gt; balance-wise, that ain&#39;t happenin&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh and the Identify spell isn&#39;t the only spell those pure casters get at<br/>
&gt; that level is it?  In fact it isnt even one of 4 per level group but more<br/>
&gt; like 1 of 8 or ten.  also our 12th level DD does 7 points of damage max.<br/>
&gt; Yeah we can cast it a lot if we don&#39;t cast anything else since none of our<br/>
&gt; spells have the 45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.<br/>

&gt; bards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>
&gt; from all other classes without binding.  I mean MAJOR UPROAR.  So it<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; matter what kind of Vulcan logic you use to argue that Bards need binding<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t happen.  Putting BardBind in your petition will do no good at all,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; probably cause Verant to not fully consider the rest of your petition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you need to ask for is to have all classes be able to bind anywhere<br/>
(or<br/>
&gt; maybe just Inns) they choose instead of just a city.  Verant is much more<br/>
&gt; likely to consider something that would be fair to all classes, and not<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; for Bards.<br/>

&gt; This whole thing strikes me as a simple troll (hee!) post. Clearly good<br/>
&gt; aligned characters being bound in evil cities is absurd. Monks could sneak<br/>
&gt; it at one point great. All the danger tolerance level in the world doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make it s SMART thing to do (as outlined by John, the hours lost due to<br/>
&gt; death don&#39;t make up for the running time). No amount of machismo makes the<br/>

&gt; any longer.<br/>

&gt; Oops. You&#39;re right. I hit a wrong note on that one. Invisibilty isn&#39;t a<br/>
viable means of escape within evil cities without the flute. However, it<br/>
does come in handy when in Feerrott or Innothule. Remember, those 5th level<br/>
lizardman scouts carry the scout fife almost all the time. You just whack<br/>
one of them hand to hand (easy to do), get their flute and now you can use<br/>
invisibility for the rest of the trip back.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d like to know how you are able to sing the invis song to get past the<br/>
&gt; guards in evil cities.  How do you get your spare flute (required to sing<br/>
&gt; invis song) out of the bank? The only way I could see this scenario<br/>
working<br/>
&gt; is if you were bound at the bank of the evil city and the banker/guards in<br/>
&gt; the bank don&#39;t attack you on sight.  I have always assumed this was not a<br/>
&gt; viable option for non-evil races because the banker and guards in the bank<br/>
&gt; would attack you on sight before you had a chance to get your flute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Galtin ofE&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We as bards have a much easier time being bound in evil cities. After we<br/>
&gt; &gt; die, we can invis past the guards, we can use our sneak ability (rogues<br/>
&gt; &gt; have it even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Selo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the<br/>
nearest<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone (you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past<br/>
though).<br/>

&gt; Here is a little trick you can maybe do to at least see inside locked huts<br/>
&gt; or buildings:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; stand right up close to it - like you are pressing your nose against the<br/>
&gt; wall<br/>
&gt; then click sit<br/>
&gt; when you go thru the sitting down animation - you will get quick glimpse<br/>
&gt; into the building<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only place I have done this is at Herman&#39;s House in SK.  I kinda like<br/>
&gt; his d´┐¢cor - Early Tunare Hut style &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. I tried one time to target him as I caught a glimpse of him but could<br/>
&gt; not click fast enough<br/>
&gt; p.s.s. yes, I know to use an AreaEffect on him<br/>
&gt; p.s.s.s. I am half-elf - not sure if body size has anything to do with<br/>
&gt; getting a view as you sit<br/>

&gt; Thanks John.  Since I&#39;m gonna try my hat at soloing for a<br/>
&gt; while, think I<br/>
&gt; might start having this song memorized.  Its too bad that it<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t teleport<br/>
&gt; the entire party to the same random location.  Do you guys<br/>
&gt; think this is<br/>
&gt; something that we should ask Verant to consider changing<br/>
&gt; somewhere down the<br/>
&gt; road?  Since it would help the entire party, and doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; impact solo play at<br/>
&gt; all, it shouldn&#39;t be a class balance issue.<br/>

&gt; time, was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I<br/>
&gt; sing that song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while at the top of the village (or any high altitude<br/>
&gt; location), will I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a<br/>
&gt; result take lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground<br/>
&gt; wherever the song<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sends me to?<br/>

&gt; marginally useful<br/>

&gt; description.  The song can indeed be used to help people escape those<br/>
&gt; darned vacuum gates in Perma and Paw, but I have for the most part found<br/>
&gt; that it doesn&#39;t help.  It appears to me that the song only teleports you<br/>
&gt; to a place within it&#39;s range that you can see.  This has been verifeid by<br/>
&gt; me when I climbed the wizard spire in Greater Faydark and North Karana.<br/>
&gt; While on the top of the spire I woul look down at the ground though I<br/>
&gt; could not see it and the teleport drops me on the side of the spire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will do some further testing when I get a chance, just to be 100% sure.<br/>
&gt; But after some trials in Perma, I do believe the teleport locations are<br/>
&gt; based on what you can you see.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and<br/>
whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally<br/>
useful<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Strategies:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn&#39;t work through walls<br/>
&gt; &gt;   anymore.  Once you&#39;re dragged up, you have walls on both sides so<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you won&#39;t teleport anywhere.  Still, it&#39;s worth a shot, especially<br/>
&gt; &gt;   if you&#39;re not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far<br/>
&gt; &gt;   enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone<br/>
&gt; &gt;   without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same<br/>
&gt; &gt;   thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cautions:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;   teleports to different locations.  Of course if that&#39;s your intent...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I&#39;ve teleported right<br/>
&gt; &gt;   into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying<br/>
&gt; &gt;   to get a friend unstuck.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>
&gt; &gt;   means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;   easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt;   make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water.<br/>

&gt; Sorry you think this topic was a troll. It was my first post to the list<br/>
and I thought I had a legitimate issue and was very happy to read the varied<br/>
opinions from the list members. Some of the opinions and play styles differ<br/>
from mine. That&#39;s cool. I can understand their motivations and now I am<br/>
better for it. Maybe my future party members may be better for it as well.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound much like a troll to me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; the long run back. It&#39;s not the ONLY way. It just may be the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; only way for some individuals depending upon their danger<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tolerance level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At level 15 when I first entered Guk that *was* the only way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;There was absolutely no way for me to get past the Troll<br/>
&gt; &gt;guards outside of Grobb in order to be bound there. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;not a tolerance level. That&#39;s a reality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This whole thing strikes me as a simple troll (hee!) post. Clearly good<br/>
&gt; aligned characters being bound in evil cities is absurd. Monks could sneak<br/>
&gt; it at one point great. All the danger tolerance level in the world doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make it s SMART thing to do (as outlined by John, the hours lost due to<br/>
&gt; death don&#39;t make up for the running time). No amount of machismo makes the<br/>
&gt; argument make any sense at all. I would suggest we not fuel the trolls fun<br/>
&gt; any longer.<br/>

&gt; Hey! Don&#39;t do that!  I started this thread, but I&#39;m not the guy that said<br/>
troll<br/>
&gt; (tho I believe he was just making a joke).  This has been a great<br/>
discussion,<br/>
&gt; and without you it would have been much less fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are willing to reason, and never resort to cheap shots.  And as a huge<br/>
&gt; bonus, you can admit when you may have made an error!  Wow, talk about a<br/>
bonus<br/>
&gt; on any discussion list.<br/>

&gt; The crysknife can indeed be found in Splitpaw. The gnoll necro, Ghanex<br/>
