<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408141685">Who said Verant wanted to stop twinking? Recently Brad answered some<br/>
questions about that and while I don&#39;t remember it exactly it was something<br/>
along the lines of not wanting to put in a hard level cap onitems. Why?<br/>
Because if somebody goes through a lot of trouble of doing a new quest or<br/>
killing some mob and gets a item he can&#39;t use why should he not be able to<br/>
use it on a new character? No where has Verant said they do no allow<br/>
twinking or anything along those lines.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; equipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; like to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bunch of people who like to play the monty-haul-start-off-<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; with-the-best-of-everything game.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me ask you this then: Suppose someone I know (a college<br/>
 </span></blockquote>student)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; has a fancy car that was given to him by his well to do parents. Now I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; own a car like this but would like to, and could certainly do so, if I so<br/>
&gt;&gt; choose, because I&#39;ve already gone to college and have a career making a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; nice salary (i.e. &quot;paid my dues&quot;). SO...If we take this line of thinking<br/>
&gt;&gt; then it would be fair or kind for me to say he doesn&#39;t deserve the car<br/>
&gt;&gt; because he didn&#39;t earn it, and so SHOULDN&#39;T have it??? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
&gt;&gt; (just a little playing the D Advocate here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m speaking in universal generalities.  One student having a<br/>
&gt;car given to him by his parents is pretty irrelevant.  OTOH,<br/>
&gt;if 80% of the students at a college have expensive cars given<br/>
&gt;to them by their parents, then that may be a factor in your<br/>
&gt;decision to (not) attend that college.  It alters the living<br/>
&gt;(playing) environment, to the dislike of some and to the like<br/>
&gt;of others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Given the half-hearted attempts Verant has made to thwart<br/>
&gt;twinking, they&#39;ve legitimized the viewpoint that you SHOULDN&#39;T<br/>
&gt;have expensive cars given to you by well-to-do parents in this<br/>
&gt;game.  I don&#39;t have a problem with people who want to twink.<br/>
&gt;I do have a problem with them wanting to do it in a game where<br/>
&gt;the designers don&#39;t want them to twink.  IMHO the ideal<br/>
&gt;solution given infinite resources would be to have some<br/>
&gt;servers a twink-fest, and others twink-free, to support both<br/>
&gt;ends of the spectrum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; That aside, please remember that we each have our own opinion and are<br/>
&gt;&gt; entitled to those opinions. Its OKAY if people disagree with your opinion<br/>
&gt;&gt; regardless of the issue at hand (sometimes I have to remind myself of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What people seem to be objecting to, IMO, is how mean-sounding it was for<br/>
&gt;&gt; that person to say &quot;... you don&#39;t deserve....&quot; etc (and I know that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>person<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; probably didn&#39;t mean it to come across as harsh as it sounded???). BUT,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Um, if there is nothing in the game that you don&#39;t deserve,<br/>
&gt;then there is no advancement, and you have the ultimate<br/>
&gt;monty-haul game.  It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>
&gt;something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>
&gt;of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>
&gt;advancement-based RPG.<br/>
