<div id="ygrps-yiv-937209157">I just hit what everyone I know refers to as &quot;Hell Level&quot;  - Level 30.<br/>
They say it&#39;s a pain to get out of. Dunno just logged after levelling, guess <br/>
i will see tomorrow =)<br/>
<br/>
Of course I couldn&#39;t wait to try out the proc on the Staff of Writhing - <br/>
deemed the &quot;Ugly Stick&quot; by my girlfriend. I ran around the E Commons killin <br/>
everything i saw just to see it proc (of course, careful not to KS anyone).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I too have found lvl 27 Song of the Sirens useful for thwarting <br/>
nuking kill-stealers...they get REALLY frustrated, and it&#39;s well-deserved I <br/>
feel muahahaha! They only thing I really use it for in a typical combat <br/>
situation is when our fetcher pulls multiple mobs and the extra mobs begin <br/>
to attack our healer. Charm it, let it walk it off a bit, then it comes <br/>
after you instead, freeing up your healer for casting. Haven&#39;t really messed <br/>
with Pixie Strike too much. I am thinking of finally forgetting Bellows <br/>
after using it so long.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t bother trying Curtailing Chant as I had to leave shortly after <br/>
levelling to 30 - anyone tried this out and can give a description of it&#39;s <br/>
effect?<br/>
<br/>
Up until now I was using a Dirk/Obsidian Shard combo in melee. I was the tin <br/>
rogue. Shard is a fun weapon to use btw (proc is useless on fire-based mobs <br/>
though), fast, decent dmg, and the effect is pretty cool.<br/>
