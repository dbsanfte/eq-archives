<div id="ygrps-yiv-700974933">I have like 1600+ items in my bard email folder and keep going there<br/>
thinking that I will delete them.  But each time I find some &#39;gem&#39; and<br/>
decide to just keep them for a while longer.  Here is a clip that might<br/>
amuse some of you:<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] high level bard suggestion<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t stop thinking about weak bards at high levels, haunted with the<br/>
&gt; premonition of myself sitting in the entrance of some dungeon,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>periodically<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; calling out I need to join a group, no answer, finally logging out after a<br/>
&gt; long night without having done a thing.  Had an idea, though, tell me what<br/>
&gt; you think.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ll find that at higher levels, the players DO appreciate a bard,<br/>
and actively seek them out, if there&#39;s not a regular one in their cadre.<br/>
 <br/>
By that point, the newbie curse of the bard has worn off, there&#39;s no<br/>
confusion in the upper level players mind about what a bard can do.  <br/>
 <br/>
And, by default, if you&#39;ve taken a bard to the 40&#39;s and beyond, you have<br/>
&quot;proven&quot; yourself to be skilled in bardic ways and a good social animal as<br/>
well.  <br/>
 <br/>
Not to mention that not only do you have an active support role, you have an<br/>
active combat role as well, and neither requires you to sit on your duff for<br/>
10 minutes after each fight, staring at a spell book.  And, when you&#39;re<br/>
along, of course, you minimize that for others as well.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as boosting bardic power, it&#39;s already done.  At 45th level, (or<br/>
pretty much any level after you get Hymn, for that matter) you DO see the<br/>
health bar move at an appreciable rate, as well as the mana bar, when a bard<br/>
is along.  A single bard in a group of 6 can flat outheal a cleric over<br/>
time, doing around 1200 hp per minute per person in the party. The offensive<br/>
powers of a bard are subtle, but still very potent.  DDD was added to give<br/>
them a bit more rapid firepower in limited situations, for there are times<br/>
when nuking is handy.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone who thinks a high level bard is weak has a serious perception or<br/>
education problem.  There&#39;s been an ongoing debate internally for months now<br/>
about bards being, if anything, too powerful, and nobody internal, even the<br/>
staunchest bard advocates, have ever claimed they were weak, not since phase<br/>
2 (before that point, many classes, including the bard, were in a much more<br/>
unfinished state).<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I think one of the defining moments for a bard is when they find<br/>
themselves no longer memorizing Bellow, even when solo.  I won&#39;t expound on<br/>
that, when that time comes, you will know.<br/>
 <br/>
So, fear not, unless you&#39;ve done something of a personal nature to make<br/>
others hesitant to group with you, you&#39;ll not lack appreciation for what you<br/>
bring to the table.<br/>
 <br/>
(end paste)<br/>
<br/>
Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the first poster turned<br/>
out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy who answered<br/>
him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him has since shed<br/>
his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I really like the<br/>
part about bards being able to heal more than clerics &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>
does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be fair - he may not<br/>
have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and with only &quot;old<br/>
world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the current use of a main<br/>
tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>

p.s. 1500 of the 1659 items are from June, July, August & September of &#39;99 -<br/>
the &quot;good ole days.&quot;</div>
