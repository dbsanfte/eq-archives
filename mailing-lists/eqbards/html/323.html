<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021231712">(I&#39;m 17, and not really into economics, or buisiness, so the following is<br/>
all limited speculation on my behalf.  Read at your own discretion, and<br/>
correct me if you may.  Friendly opinions welcomed too.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, personally I feel that we may be demanding too much out of the company<br/>
right now.  Yes, it was realeased as only a portion of what it SHOULD be,<br/>
but the entire process...hiring all the help, setting up servers, beta<br/>
testing, and everything else, must have cost a FORTUNE compared to what your<br/>
average game would cost to produce  (Avg game = Anything not promising lots<br/>
of future patches or an evolving world, etc.).<br/>
For ANY company, even a subdivision of the super-rich Sony Corp, to invest<br/>
enough time and cash into a game like this to get rid of ALL significant<br/>
bugs etc. would be an incredible risk for the company.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it took god 6 days to create the world...and on the seventh day he<br/>
rested.  Give Brad and the team a break, they are only humans...humans under<br/>
the confines of a Sony controlled company, which does have to be careful how<br/>
they invest their money.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that bugs me is that an expansion was already hinted at being<br/>
in the works by a Verant employee, and they still have bards strumming a<br/>
stick when playing the drums.  Don&#39;t even get me started on the other holes,<br/>
you all know what I&#39;m talking about.  If they ARE building an expansion now,<br/>
I would stop playing immediatly.  A company that would think of money from<br/>
an expansion before bringing quality promised to an existing product has its<br/>
priorities WAY off base.<br/>
<br/>
Heres why I think they are working on expansions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How much? I can&#39;t get into anything like that because we haven&#39;t even<br/>
really officially announced anything about expansions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was said by Brad McQuaid in response to questions concerning the price<br/>
of future expansions.  It definately hints at something going on, but of<br/>
course there are no official announcements yet.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There will be announcements soon about what to expect (well, more like<br/>
teasers). I really do wish I could tell you more, because there&#39;s some<br/>
really cool stuff, but I am not the keeper of PR.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was said by Rick Schmitz, artist at Verant, in response to the question<br/>
of the possability of an expansion.  It definately hints at it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I&#39;ll deal with it when the official announcements are made.  Expect<br/>
cussing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;&gt; Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Talk about your vague statements!<br/>
&gt;Does that mean that when I die in North Karanas, and I run around<br/>
&gt;the newbie zone singing Dissonance, killing everything withing sight,<br/>
&gt;to get some gold to buy food for the trip back, that I am farming?<br/>
&gt;My friend consistenly lures monsters our way with spells, to save<br/>
&gt;us the hassle of chasing it down.  Is this farming?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here come some more, from the web site:<br/>
&gt;     Price Gouging ´┐¢ finding items that have anomalous pricing and<br/>
&gt;abusing them, such as items that sell for more than they cost to buy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, this one seems to make some sense.  If an NPC has lost his mind<br/>
&gt;and is selling fine steel swords for 1gp, and buys it back off you for<br/>
&gt;1pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     PvP Switch Avoidance ´┐¢ Using in-game methods to work around the PvP<br/>
&gt;switch and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players,<br/>
&gt;     such as hall blocking, dumping of monsters, or spell effects that<br/>
&gt;cross that boundary due to a bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dumping of monsters?!  I&#39;d like someone to prove that I was<br/>
&gt;intentionally dumping the monster, and not just running for the guard.<br/>
&gt;But I guess that&#39;s the point, isn&#39;t it?  Verant don&#39;t have to prove<br/>
&gt;anything, do they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think there is a larger issue here.  In a word, it is &#39;Verant&#39;.<br/>
&gt;I am impressed with the game, but unimpressed with Verant, on so<br/>
&gt;many levels.  I have come close to cancelling my account once already.<br/>
