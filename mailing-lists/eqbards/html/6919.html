&gt; &gt; I believe it is, but it is medium sized only, so humans<br/>
&gt; &gt; and half elves only.  It uses the chain model.<br/>

&gt; The odd thing is, high elves and wood elves are supposed to be<br/>
&gt; able to wear medium armor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but there are some items that I refer to as &quot;&lt;whatever&gt; sized only&quot; which<br/>
really means &quot;only races that can wear size &lt;whatever&gt; only&quot;.  There are several<br/>
examples actually, though usually a size small issue, like the kaladim scarab<br/>
armour which is &quot;small size only&quot; (halflings dwarves and gnomes only).<br/>
<br/>
In this case, only the pure medium sizes can wear this.  Barbarians, who can also<br/>
wear size medium, are also out of luck, which is a shame, because it would be an<br/>
amazing shaman or rogue item for a barbarian.<br/>
