<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802834646">I think the best arguement against twinking has been made alreadty, it is<br/>
your decision whether you think it is right or wrong.  It is not for me or<br/>
anyone to decide whether it is fair or unfair.  I agree with the thought<br/>
that twinking ruins your experience with your class.  Does wearing a full<br/>
suit of bronze at level 1 change your newbie experience?  Of course it<br/>
does. Now I have heard arguments being made that the first few levels are<br/>
tedious and not worth playing.  Well I believe that would be the wrong way<br/>
to look at things.  I myself have played abot 7 characters to level 4-5 to<br/>
determine what classes interest me.  Have I twinked any of them, in all<br/>
honesty I have twinked one (gave him a dwarven axe, crush&#39;s tunic and 20<br/>
plat) and let twinked one just abit (gave her a few pieces of cloth at<br/>
level 2-3 and a giant snake fang).  Indeed twinking my ranger made<br/>
leveling from 1 to 5 extremely easy, but it in turn made me bored an<br/>
unhappy with this character.  Just recently I started a barbarian shaman<br/>
and have just gotten him to level 5, and you know what I am very happy<br/>
that I didn&#39;t twink him.  I have begun to learn his strengths and weakness<br/>
without endangering myself or others too much.  Once again it is your<br/>
choice, but it would be a pity for you to reach level 50 without a full<br/>
understanding of your class.  People have to remember that many classes<br/>
have the unique characteristics that only manifest themselves through<br/>
play, and the newbie levels serve as a safe learning ground to understand<br/>
your chosen class.  Remember nothing looks more foolish than a<br/>
bard who thinks he is a warrior who can play the &quot;Heal Song&quot; at<br/>
level 20, a mage who can&#39;t use their pet, or a shaman who only knows how<br/>
to heal, burn and cast sow.  Now that would be sad to me.<br/>

&gt; But you can&#39;t say that for everyone.  Some people don&#39;t think it is fun<br/>
&gt; taking the long way.  They like shortcuts (and being able to cheat and<br/>
&gt; exploit - I am not one of them by the way).   I have a friend that I work<br/>
&gt; with that won&#39;t even buy EverQuest because he can&#39;t cheat.  He is the type<br/>
&gt; that looks on the Internet for cheat codes for a game and then buys the<br/>
&gt; game.  If he can&#39;t find any cheat codes - he won&#39;t buy it.  Asinine?  Yes.<br/>
&gt; But that is what he enjoys.  Does that make us any better because we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like to cheat?  No way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with some of your points - however I can tell you that twinking will<br/>
&gt; not ruin the experience, especially if it is a second character.  With my<br/>
&gt; primary character, I have been to every single zone in the game except for<br/>
&gt; Solusek A and B and Kedge Keep.  Twinking a second character does not<br/>
&gt; detract from the experience of the game - it just makes the monotony of the<br/>
&gt; lower levels a little bit easier, and may cut down on the deaths  that you<br/>
&gt; would normally get from learning experience.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this is a first time character for him, even being in full bronze at that<br/>
&gt; level will not matter much.  Full bronze is only 1 point greater than<br/>
&gt; banded, and alot heavier.  Also your AC is directly related to your Defense<br/>
&gt; skill (and other modifiers.)  He is still capped at Level * 5, so at the<br/>
&gt; most he would get maybe a 20-25 point increase in his AC rating. </span></blockquote></div>
