<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471914795">It might be worth while to analyse AE more closely.  For the past 10+<br/>
levels, I am concerned with keeping my clerics and casters in AE for mana<br/>
song and spend time in outside views watching for the sparkles.  It might be<br/>
worth while to get a friend - ungrouped and test the actual AE radius for<br/>
your dmg songs.  One might find that you can use them with the dreaded<br/>
enchanters - as long as you can not wake up the sleeping mobs.  And maybe<br/>
bards can do this once you understand the AE radius well.  Also, this<br/>
presumes that we want to do this (ie your songs will do more dmg that your<br/>
weps.)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll be trying out weapon vs no weapon tonite for those at 23rd or below.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll let you know how the comparison is at that point so we can begin a<br/>
&gt; curve to see what works where.  Biggest problem I have is all my<br/>
instrument<br/>
&gt; attacks are AoE.<br/>
