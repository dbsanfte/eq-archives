<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939889259">Everyone who supports this song, please e-mail me your name.  I would like to<br/>
send this proposal to Verant, with a list of names (read paying customers)<br/>
supporting the idea.<br/>
<br/>
For Everyone who believes that Verant will NEVER CHANGE, I&#39;m sorry you feel you<br/>
can&#39;t make a difference.  There is no need to flame a reply to me, as in your<br/>
opinion Verant will ignore/flame me themselves.<br/>

PS. I was told in 1987 I could not do a certain job in the Navy (at that time<br/>
for men only).  I was the first woman to serve on a Naval Destroyer doing that<br/>
job in 1995. Do NOT tell me what I CAN&#39;T DO!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Song: Bardic Binding Bellow<br/>
&gt; Level: 21<br/>
&gt; Casting Req&#39;s:  Mana, 200 (Self) + 100 Per group member, 800 Mana for full<br/>
&gt; group + Reagent (Enchanted electrum or something like that),<br/>
&gt; ore, etc. Possibly make a Zone Specific Reagent<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stipulations: Can only be sung once per day, similar to Lay of Hands<br/>
&gt; Acquired: By multi-part quest, forcing the bard to travel to many zones<br/>
&gt; (thus preventing us from becoming Bind whores)<br/>
&gt;                Possible addendum to this.. make two spells.. the first being<br/>
&gt;                a Self-Only Bind that is bought at a merchant.  Still<br/>
&gt;                would use reagents, but would not have a casting restriction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                The Second Bind spell would be a Quest.  It would be group<br/>
&gt;                bind, but would difficult AND have a casting delay built in<br/>
&gt;                like lay of Hands, etc.  If you did it this way, you could<br/>
&gt;                even make the delay greater, say 2 days.  This would enable<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;                bard to be able to self-bind at any time, but only group bind<br/>
&gt;                on a limited basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this is an excellent idea. </span></blockquote></div>
