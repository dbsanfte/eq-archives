<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-467539656"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Since you apparently are a person who has been PK&#39;d, I have some questions<br/>
&gt; about how PK works.  Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>
&gt; that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>
&gt; worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>
&gt; Percentages, etc.<br/>
&gt; also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>
&gt; player?  Items?  Money?  Nothing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize this is the wrong forum for theses questions, but dang it, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the rules for a pk are the same as looting rules for a duel ,,<br/>
you are able to loot anything that is equipped ,, or in an open inventory<br/>
slot ,,, plus all the money on the corpse ,,,<br/>
<br/>
I was pk&#39;ed by what is called a &quot;naked mage&quot;     actually a Dark Elf wizard<br/>
,,,  they carry absolutely nothing on them ,, and bag all the loot that they<br/>
get ,, if I were to kill him ,,,  if I could kill him,,, all I would get is<br/>
what gold he took off my corpse ,,,  never get my tunic back ,,,  I died at<br/>
the entrance to HHP in kith woods ,, my spawn point was just inside the HHP<br/>
zone ,, I was hunting orcs ,,  by the time I made it back ,,,  just about 30<br/>
seconds ,,, the brigand had enough time to loot my corpse and gate out ,,,,<br/>
oh well ,,,  a new tunic will cost me a total of 5pp to get ,,,,  just the<br/>
fact that it happened ,,,  that&#39;s not race war roleplaying ,,, that&#39;s pure<br/>
greed ,,,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m sorry ,, this really isn&#39;t the forum for this discussion ,, but I tend<br/>
to ramble</div>
