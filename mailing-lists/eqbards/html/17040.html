Harmony is better.  But if you dont have a druid... (does anyone else think<br/>
the bard song should have been harmony and the druid spell lament? musical<br/>
connotations and all?)<br/>
<br/>
You might try getting a charisma buff or some cha jewelry and see it you can<br/>
notice a difference.  You are close to capping out at cha where it makes any<br/>
difference (100 seems to be the point where the returns are diminishing.)<br/>
Silk evening tunic you can buy from gypsy vendors in south qeynos. Dont buy<br/>
a crude stien - go to Ogguuk and loot one for free.  Lots of dead bouncers<br/>
there and the high levels dont bother to loot the stiens.<br/>
<br/>
Harmony is by design different:  AOE, non-agro is resisted.  Many bard<br/>
things are sometimes ok to use if you dont have the real thing.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve had a lot of trouble using Lugubrious Lament<br/>
&gt; effectively.  Maybe part of the problem is that I also<br/>
&gt; play a druid and Harmony seems far superior to me, not<br/>
&gt; only because it&#39;s AOE, but because it is resisted so<br/>
&gt; seldom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard from some bards that this is a great song,<br/>
&gt; from others that it&#39;s useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My charisma is currently 91 and I&#39;m 14th lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, would someone have a better chance of using<br/>
&gt; Lament holding a crude stein instead of a lute?  I<br/>
&gt; have a line on one of these but since I can&#39;t hold one<br/>
&gt; and use an instrument at the same time, don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; spend the money if it won&#39;t work.<br/>
