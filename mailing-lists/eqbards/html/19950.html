 </span></blockquote>Um. That is part of playing on Test. It is one of the things you agree<br/>
to. I played on Test for a while (Faesong started there got a bubble or so<br/>
from 17 before I decided to recreate her on Sol Ro) It was accepted that<br/>
Verant could do anything they wanted with<br/>
Test. Its not a production server. They HAVE done player wipes before.<br/>
