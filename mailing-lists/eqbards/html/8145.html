check.  And here&#39;s my prediction (a little nasty):<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;what are lambent greaves?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;There are no finer blah blah blah...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
(buy two fire opal from genni, cost 1100 gold)<br/>
(kill numerous hill giants/griffons in NK to get lament)<br/>
(hand ostorm opals and lament)<br/>
(kill 20 or so elites in king room to finally get greaves)<br/>
(kill the shin knight numerous times to get greaves)<br/>
(handing icy greaves and shin greaves and opal lament to Walthin)<br/>
<br/>
Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Ah you have returned with... blah blah...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
(acquire geaves, right click them)<br/>

WTF?????  wis and int?  Man I was ripped off, this sucks.<br/>
<br/>
/petition You all messed up again, you gave me cleric type<br/>
armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize bards primary stats<br/>
are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You probably just typo&#39;d in the<br/>
armor database again, which is fairly typical these days. =)<br/>
<br/>
GM tells you &#39;Hail, guide Soandso here.  I&#39;ve read your <br/>
petition.  And honestly there&#39;s nothing I can do, if you<br/>
would file a bug report that would be appreciated&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If Verant does this again, like they did on the PoS, err I<br/>
mean PoF armor (not to mention the pisspoor color) I will <br/>
flood them with feedback/petitions/etc.  In fact everytime<br/>
I take a faction hit from someone else&#39;s kill, I petition.<br/>
Only the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and typing a message<br/>
in a bug report that is never read gets me more frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I hate working hard for a crappy reward.  That&#39;s why I currently<br/>
do no quests (for the ones that actually work).  These days in<br/>
Norrath are making this bard bitter =)<br/>
