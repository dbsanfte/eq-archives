<div id="ygrps-yiv-309033882">I recently picked up a Claw and a Smoldering brand for 2k and 2.8k per.<br/>
Both look very nice and the brand lays out more damage than a Yak. With<br/>
the current E&#39;ci prices for Partisans I&#39;d say (for best damage in that<br/>
price range) try to pick up a brand. If you can&#39;t find one in your<br/>
price range and nobody his hocking Yaks (twilight zone) I&#39;ve got an old<br/>
one dusting in the bank I&#39;d let go for an even 2k.<br/>

However, you are 45 and in a level or two you will be able to hit the<br/>
planes and pick up a weapon better than anything else you can get for<br/>
around 2k. Keep that in mind while shopping.<br/>
