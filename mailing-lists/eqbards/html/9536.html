<div id="ygrps-yiv-468092695">I see from the board that many of you are upset that the undead spawns in Kithicor were <br/>
stopped.  I&#39;d like to make the following points:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Kithicor is, at one and the same time, a newbie zone AND a zone that you MUST <br/>
travel through in order to get from the four eastern cities to RV, and that you would <br/>
much prefer to use to get from RV to High Keep.  Note that the alternate route to <br/>
HK/Qeynos/Halas from RV takes you through Runnyeye and Beholder, hardly safe zones <br/>
below level 20 or so, and takes a LOT longer to HK.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The fact that these spawn only appeared at night is not a help.  In order to <br/>
traverse the zone safely, this would require you to wait until dawn each time you <br/>
wanted to get through the zone (unless you were sufficiently high level that it didn&#39;t <br/>
matter, see point 3).  If you thought waiting for the boat was irritating...   This is <br/>
NOT a good use of playing time.  Plus, although the spawn did not appear during the <br/>
daytime, I am not convinced that they actually evaporated at dawn.<br/>
<br/>
3.  I travelled through Kithicor the other night at the tail end of the event.  Even <br/>
with sixty people actively hunting, I blundered into 3 spawn points between WC and RV, <br/>
and 2 points between RV and HP.  Luckily, three of them had not yet &quot;dropped&quot; from the <br/>
sky, and the other two I was able to put on the brakes for (barely), but I note the <br/>
following:  1)  two of these points were so close to the zone wall that even the &quot;edge <br/>
of zone&quot; travel method would not have worked, and 2) the one MOB that engaged me killed <br/>
me (a level THIRTY ONE Bard) in three casts.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see a high level outdoor zone, myself, but it should not replace a <br/>
newbie zone, and it should certainly not be placed in a zone critical for low- to <br/>
mid-level travel.<br/>

&gt; I think that it does have something to do with it.  I read plenty of posts<br/>
&gt; on alt.games.everquest from characters who were furious about dying due to<br/>
&gt; the massive undead spawns.  Unfortunate....<br/>

&gt; &gt;               On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party<br/>
&gt; &gt; talked to a gm<br/>
&gt; &gt; and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
&gt; &gt; newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>
