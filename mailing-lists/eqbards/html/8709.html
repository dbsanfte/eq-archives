&gt;Until I gain 4-5 more levels, the only way I will be able to acquire any of<br/>
&gt;the bard quest components is to purchase the looting rights from someone.<br/>
&gt;Because these are all new items, the market for them hasn&#39;t really been<br/>
&gt;established yet.  As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how much<br/>
&gt;PP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>
&gt;component by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>
&gt;paid for it.  That will give me and other bards in my situation a good<br/>
&gt;starting point in our negotiations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

Personally though I do not plan on buying any of the components (except for <br/>
the gems of course), why?  Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>
acquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>
want the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>
takes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel is <br/>
the right way to go.<br/>
<br/>
As for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>
the looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad in <br/>
there own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>
bonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>
market to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending on <br/>
the item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop caring <br/>
about how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
