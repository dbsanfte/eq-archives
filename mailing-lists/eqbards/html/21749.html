*looks over his shoulder*  <br/>
*puts tin foil over his head*  &lt;-- simpsons episode where baseball league<br/>
was spying on consumers<br/>

P.S. I doubt anyone saw this commercial (for NFL) for the Ottawa Senators<br/>
but its a parody of Sixth Sense. The 2 are in the car at a stop light, and a<br/>
crossing guard is helping kids cross the street and the kid in the car tursn<br/>
to his mom and says in a whisper &quot;i see hockey players&quot;. cracks me up every<br/>
time</div>
