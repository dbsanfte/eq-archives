<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003194400">Just a reminder: tomorrow (Saturday, Feb 12th, 2000) is the retirement party <br/>
for JackalX, one of the first 50th level bards and a stalwart contributor to <br/>
the bardic community.  This is an opportunity to say goodbye to him, to meet <br/>
and mingle with other bards from every server, and to have some silly fun at <br/>
the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Meet at the Priest of Discord in Rivervale at 12noon PST (that&#39;s 3pm EST, <br/>
8pm GMT) on the Tunare server.  Bring a halfling with a name beginning with <br/>
Jx and then your bard&#39;s name (e.g. Jxaloro, Jxdemari).  It&#39;s been brought to <br/>
my attention that some of these names, for who knows what reason, aren&#39;t <br/>
getting through the filter.  Try adding an &#39;a&#39; after Jx if needed (e.g. <br/>
Jxademari).  Please don&#39;t go /anon or /roleplay, so we can find you and get <br/>
a participation count, and please don&#39;t go PvP or we can&#39;t bind you.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to run to High Pass, get bound, and then run out to the gorge in <br/>
EK and leap lemminglike into the great beyond.  Following our ritual mass <br/>
suicide, drinks will be served and merriment will ensue.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there!<br/>
<br/>
Jxaloro (Tunare)<br/>
