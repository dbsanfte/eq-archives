<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485694411">I know a chanter that is level 60, and he&#39;s got quite a few 50+ chars. And<br/>
he said he could twink any class to 50 in 2 weeks. I asked him even a bard?<br/>
He said no way they&#39;re too tough.<br/>
<br/>
/sigh<br/>
<br/>
No wonder we&#39;re a dying breed, we keep getting the shaft and even the twinks<br/>
are dropping off the face of norrath. On another note, i noticed other class<br/>
populations in my guild has dropped a ton. I used to play my necro, so did 3<br/>
other necros in the guild, now im playing my bard full time, another is<br/>
playing his warrior and loving it (52 now), another is playing his rogue(49<br/>
now) and the 3rd other is playing a chanter now i beleive. 3 shamans have<br/>
ditched their shamans and are playing: chanters, rogues, monks.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that we&#39;re seeing an influx of classes being ditched for other<br/>
classes that are more wanted (guess im being silly for going to my bard<br/>
*shrug*)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gosh. Lets see... well, there&#39;s me and...<br/>
<br/>
Me.  That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
In fact of the 60 people in my guild (Praetoriate on Bertoxxulous), I&#39;m the<br/>
only serious Bard.  We&#39;ve got a level 8 twink, and he only ever comes on<br/>
when his regular hunting partner isn&#39;t on.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the proverbial redheaded stepchild, but in time I<br/>
suppose that&#39;ll have its advantages.<br/>
<br/>
I know Windleaf is on Bertoxx, too, but I&#39;ve yet to see him on the /who all<br/>
bard 30 60 list... (are you anon?) Our server has tons and tons of newbie<br/>
Bards, but they all seem to drop off the face of Norrath when they hit 20 or<br/>
thereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
At peak times, I&#39;ll maybe see 16 post-30 non-anon/rpg Bards.<br/>
