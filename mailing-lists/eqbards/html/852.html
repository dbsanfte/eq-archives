<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306451406">It&#39;s a great deal heavier than normal plate armor of the same size.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the plate that comes out of unrest is SMALL plate, only wearable by<br/>
treehugg, er Wood Elf, bards.  Half elf and human bards are out of luck at<br/>
this time, there&#39;s one, count &#39;em, one, high level monster in Najena that<br/>
drops medium bronze plate, and very rarely at that.<br/>

&gt;| Bronze is found in Unrest, and you can easily buy it there from higher<br/>
&gt;| level players who loot it.<br/>
&gt;|<br/>
&gt;| It has the same AC and slightly less weight than the platemail that you<br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;| buy from merchants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really? I was under the impression that it is way heavier than regular<br/>
&gt;plate. If this is correct why would anyone ever buy normal plate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;| If you want some easy loot in a safe dungeon, go to Paw. At level 18 you<br/>
&gt;| can solo the whole place, but still get exp from captains, commanders,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;| the high shamans. Snakeskin armor and the sought after runed totem staff<br/>
&gt;| are your rewards. I bring back 100 plat worth of loot on every trip. And<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;| Fenin Ro the zone goes neglected. I have never seen it with more than 20<br/>
&gt;| people, and very often I am the only one there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would agree that Paws is underpopulated in most servers (Cazic averages<br/>
&gt;10-15 in evenings) and the loot is quite decent although 100 plat might be<br/>
&gt;high unless you sell the staves at a high price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Soloing *all* of it at level 18 I can&#39;t quite agree with. Ghanex Drah can<br/>
&gt;bring some tense moments at times and Zixx Nenixx will simply smoke your<br/>
@#$<br/>
&gt;all the way back to the zoneline. That is, if he doesn&#39;t charm you first.<br/>
=)<br/>
&gt;He was red to me at 20 and was frequently hitting for 50. Then there is his<br/>
&gt;pet. And he seems to get some decent help from the locals too...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good Journey,<br/>

&gt;&gt;Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>
&gt;&gt;level.  Currently I am hunting Beholder Maze frequently , sometimes high<br/>
&gt;&gt;hold pass or Oasis of Marr.  Any good suggestions?  Are any of the<br/>
&gt;multitude<br/>
&gt;&gt;of islands out in the Ocean of Tears any good?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately I seem to have solo hunting and hunting with a cleric<br/>
partner<br/>
&gt;&gt;down to an art, but whenever I get into a group I always seem to die.  As<br/>
&gt;&gt;you all know, we frequently become the baiters because of our speed, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;because of that if you pick up more than the chosen monster to fight<br/>
&gt;&gt;accidentally, death is not a far step away.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, I am outfitted in full banded, but have not even seen a place with<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;bronze armor some have spoken of, or some of the many magic items that<br/>
&gt;&gt;proliferate the deeper dungeons.<br/>
