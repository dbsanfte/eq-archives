<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126085235">Definitely Agreed!  Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think running naked<br/>
accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp you had fun<br/>
getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some bizarre got to<br/>
get to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does anyone understand<br/>
that at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun getting those<br/>
xp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and have fun again?<br/>
Unless you let thsi get out of control by not taking unreasonable risks,<br/>
wait I thought that was the whole point of a death penalty?, there shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be a problem.  Unless of course playing isn&#39;t fun, only going up levels is<br/>
fun.  Of course at that point running naked to get your corpse still isn&#39;t<br/>
fun because while you are doing that you aren&#39;t going up levels.<br/>

&gt; There does?  When and where did this ridiculous idea get started?  Back in<br/>

Systems engineering 101.  Positive and zero feedback systems<br/>
are inherently unstable.  Negative feedback systems are<br/>
stable.  If the negative penalties for an incorrect behavior<br/>
do not outweigh the potential rewards, that behavior will<br/>
proliferate (go unstable).  Case and point - insta-res thieves<br/>
in UO.<br/>

like cogs in a wheel, so I can say stuff like this.  :-)<br/>
