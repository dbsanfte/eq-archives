getting the out of drink message, but had to camp and go work away<br/>
from EQ for a week so never managed to get thirsty!!  Now I&#39;m back,<br/>
I&#39;m just about to head back to *cough* reality and see what happens.<br/>
Although I&#39;m not too far from 45 so maybe that&#39;s the trick :-)<br/>
