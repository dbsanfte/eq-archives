 </span></blockquote>The Chants are fixed now - give them a whirl.  There&#39;s a<br/>
strong possibility you&#39;ll never want to use your weapons again<br/>
(well, until you run into a spite golem :).  Before the Chant<br/>
series was fixed, the only other real alternative was the<br/>
Psalms for the damage shield.  Binding also is useful at times<br/>
since it doesn&#39;t break snare nor mez.  It *may* prevent some<br/>
lower level slowdowns from sticking however.  But in most<br/>
cases when facing multiple mobs, slowing down 5 mobs until the<br/>
enchanter can get them mezed is more useful than slowing down<br/>
just the one mob that the group is fighting.<br/>
