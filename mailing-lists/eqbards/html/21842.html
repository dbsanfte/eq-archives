<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457847308">Yes it can be done. Is the group as effective without an enchanter? Not<br/>
by a long shot. Why should one class have the monopoly on bringing that<br/>
kind of effectiveness to the group?<br/>

&gt; &gt;If a bard could even keep 3 mezzed it would at least make grouping at<br/>
&gt; &gt;50+ a bit more fun than having to sit around until an enchanter logged<br/>
&gt; &gt;on to go to Sebilis or HS. Once you pass 55 even pickup groups in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Karnors stop being an option as the front mobs turn mostly green.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve been getting pickup groups in sebilis at 53.  we&#39;ve done guardian, zone<br/>
&gt; in and zone out without enchanters.  i think the jail is also doable without<br/>
&gt; an enchanter but the only time i was there, we happened to have one.<br/>
