OK time for a new wrinkle on the stalker issue, have any of you who play female characters noticed a trend in the race of the stalkers?<br/>
<br/>
I mostly group w/ females or guys from my guild. The last night I noticed something.  We had two males, a helf & welf, I had never grouped w/ before and over the evening, both sent the usual emotes (drool, stares etc) to my helf and the other girl helf who later joined us. When the party got split up, ne was even sleezy enough to give the &quot;Madman behind you&quot; call while I was looting my body, because after his emotes, I faced him to loot.  I<br/>
suspected he was just trying to get me to turn around, so I took my time coming out of the loot window.  No madman.  I shifted positions so my back was against a wall, started looting, & gave a tell to my 1/2ling niece, that I needed help w/ the weirdo & to have the rest of the group hurry back to camp.  Bless her short little heart, I hear the rest get back, and her say to my peeping tom, that &quot;Don&#39;t look, Antie isn&#39;t for you&quot; and had her Troll<br/>
daughter stand in front of me till I was dressed.<br/>
<br/>
The night before I had grouped w/ 3 guys who I had grouped w/ once or twice (all Trolls), and I never had a problem.  In fact I started the friendly flirting, when after they told me again how much they liked having a bard in the group, that I liked grouping w/ Troll boys cause they are so big and strong.  It&#39;s quite a sight to see 3x 12-15th lvl Trolls all blushing & looking shyly at their feet.<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered if anyone else has noticed the harrassment following racial line?  1) What races did you find to be the worst? 2) What races have you spend time around, but not had a problem?<br/>
<br/>
My answers: 1) Welfs/Helfs/Humans (sorry guys!), Hielfs & one particularly rude and &quot;grabby&quot; 1/2ling.   2) Trolls (they are evil and not real pretty, but real gentlemen), Gnomes and Erudians.<br/>
<br/>
As for this being a Bard issue, well most of the guys I&#39;ve had problems with are from the races bards come from (not that I have ever had a problem w/ a male bard), but you guys might want to watch what your brothers are doing, before they give you a bad name.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As a male (RL), playing a couple of female characters (aside from being<br/>
&gt; fun and amusing) has been educational in an unsettling sort of way.  I<br/>
&gt; was soloing a low-level (6 or 7) female human warrior one night, and for<br/>
&gt; slightly over an hour, every time I turned around (literally), the same<br/>
&gt; male character was following me, hiding behind rocks and trees.  He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t say anything for about 45 minutes, then started sending suggestive<br/>
&gt; tells to me.  I was being stalked!  And, even in the safety of my own<br/>
&gt; living room, it felt pretty damned creepy. </span></blockquote></div>
