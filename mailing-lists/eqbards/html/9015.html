<div id="ygrps-yiv-136504782">I noticed an odd effect in Lullaby and concluded that perhaps I (and most of<br/>
this list) were wrong about just how it worked.  I was fighting bandits in W<br/>
karana and was easily getting some of the blue ones to nod while I killed<br/>
the others one at a time.  However, I noticed that if you were actually in<br/>
melee range the bandit would nod, but still attack.  If i backed off they<br/>
just stood there and nodded.  I assumed from this that in fact lullaby<br/>
merely reduced the aggro range to melee instead of stunning them.  Perhaps<br/>
this was a change and the stealth nerf we are discussing?<br/>

&gt; Hmm. I&#39;ve tried lullaby on other players at least twice since March and<br/>
&gt; it never worked at all. <br/>
<br/>
I tried it in the Arena about a month ago.  At least one of<br/>
the players reported it was stunning him, though he was only<br/>
level 24 (to my 35 at the time).  This was back when I was<br/>
first beginning to suspect Strike was broken, so we didn&#39;t do<br/>
any of the tests I suggested.<br/>
