<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-580859533">Actually I noticed significant difference in chains last nite at lvl 30.  I<br/>
had seen that the mobs I had been fighting before the patch would never<br/>
escape as their run away point was less than or equal to the point at which<br/>
chains stopped them in their tracks.  Last nite this was no longer the case.<br/>
The mobs would start to flee slowly and had to be hit several more times to<br/>
stop them.  Just by inspection it appeared the stop point had gone down from<br/>
around 33% to 25%.  Not a huge difference, but significant enough in<br/>
multi-mob fights to be a problem.  I had been in the habit of being primary<br/>
snarer whenever I was not in a party with a ranger of equal level due to<br/>
resist problems for the ranger.  I think this will be another song that will<br/>
now go unused as the available equivalent is now observably superior.  For<br/>
the first time in several months I actually had my group ask me to stop<br/>
chaining so someone with a real Snare could take over, despite their being 3<br/>
levels below me.<br/>

Yes, it works the same as always for anyone under level 38.  But at level 38<br/>
it used to stop mobs at 50% health instead of 30% (which is what it does<br/>
from 23 to 38).  Now it is 30% even after 38.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I would be willing to admit to the possibility that the 50% speed<br/>
reduction after level 38 may have been an unintended bug but.... to change<br/>
it without telling us... ouchie<br/>
