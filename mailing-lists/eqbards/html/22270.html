<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287913579">i love to charm too.  but this opens up a huge new avenue for us to crowd<br/>
control.  not only no secondary resist, but longer duration, which is my<br/>
favorite part since if they really do it right we have a chance to lock<br/>
something down for longer than the normal 12-18 second song duration.  i<br/>
think that&#39;s huge, as we can easily keep multiple mobs under control.<br/>
