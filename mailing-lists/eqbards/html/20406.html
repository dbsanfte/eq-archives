<br/>
Dont know if they are really cracking down on this or not but...<br/>
<br/>
Gordon posted when questioned about &#39;macro&#39; programs that things that<br/>
allowed you to build skill while a.f.k. would be considered bannable.  So,<br/>
would that mean going a.f.k. while playing a brass song *with a brass<br/>
instrument equipped* would be bannable - because you are building skill<br/>
while afk??  Who knows, so you may want to find a really out of the way<br/>
place where you are not likely to be seen. I did my skill building in the<br/>
Shady cave a few months back.  And bards in general should do stints of<br/>
brass skill building just to keep things maxxed.  Like those who have just<br/>
gotten Max Berserker song - also brass skill and you have prolly let brass<br/>
slip.  When I did mine, I would pop back every 20-30 minutes and stop and<br/>
restart the song.  Seems there are more skill checks at the start than as<br/>
you play the songs.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] LEHP!!! Fear song....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is it really called the fear song because you get into a panic trying to<br/>
&gt; make it stick????  Any clues on how to better use this?  Yes, I&#39;m sure<br/>
we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; covered it umpteen times but ok yeah, I had my head up my butt :)  I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; 26, so its still new and I expect some misses but I counted 27 in a ROW<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; morning!!! EEEEEP!<br/>
