<div id="ygrps-yiv-784171484">When a kiter is hassling you, get some pumice and haul it around with you,<br/>
it has effect of dispell. So if a druid sow&#39;s you you can remove it. Or even<br/>
better if he for instance is kiting a giant, he&#39;s using sow, and his giant<br/>
is snared, dispell them both and watch him get out of this one, this has<br/>
been very usefull for us when a couple of high level shamans tried to steal<br/>
our very nasty named hill giant once. (Brood Bloodbeard).  they had to back<br/>
off to rebuff themselves hence letting us get more damage.  Its such a pain<br/>
in the butt when you spend over half an hour on a rare and someone tries to<br/>
steal it like that.  We got the kill, got 2pp each from it and a set of<br/>
giant toes, great rare verant!   oh and Ocylis ogrebane (or whatever its<br/>
name is) the cyclops had junk like this too.   Both are 40+ mobs and have<br/>
tons and tons of hp.  Killing zazamoukth was easier then brood<br/>

&gt; I agree on the points you brought up Mike, but the graphics won&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; chenged until they do an art patch, probably in the expansion.  Barbarian<br/>
&gt; shield graphics have the same problem and fixing it would require patching<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; huge file and making everyone patch in for about 45 minutes on a 56K line,<br/>
&gt; longer if slower.  I believe the graphics will get fixed, just don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; it can happen before the expansion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of much greater concern is the SoW change.  Last nite on E&#39;ci druids,<br/>
&gt; angry<br/>
&gt; at losing their ridiculous ability to kite creatures that would slaughter<br/>
&gt; someone 10 levels above them of any other class, were SoW&#39;ing every bard<br/>
&gt; coming out of Freeport.  I got hit and then 30 minutes later got hit again<br/>
&gt; by another druid in W commons.  He even went so far as to laugh and say<br/>
&gt; &#39;Outrun me now nerf-boy!&#39;  Talk about childish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>
&gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>
&gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>
&gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the<br/>
&gt; bank<br/>
&gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>
&gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>
&gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>
&gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>
&gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>
&gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>
&gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>
&gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; weigh<br/>
&gt; 10 lbs.<br/>

&gt; I have just posted the following Usenet message on the alt.games.everquest<br/>
&gt; board that Brad says he browses, please agree or disagree, back me up, and<br/>
&gt; hopefully I was not out of line in speaking for all of us:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Myself and others who have regular discussions on the ONELIST bard&#39;s forum<br/>
&gt; are concerned about the recent changes to SoW that is affecting our Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Accelerando.  It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>
&gt; try to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>
&gt; ability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>
&gt; with the Levitate spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>
&gt; sack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to<br/>
&gt; accept<br/>
&gt; that our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>
&gt; and hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>
&gt; sack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>
&gt; graphic for the brass horn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>
&gt; overall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>
&gt; inclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>
&gt; person at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>
&gt; overlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>
&gt; to be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>
&gt; issues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>
&gt; our Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>
&gt; affect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already<br/>
&gt; burdened<br/>
&gt; development resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>
&gt; us with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; address the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari<br/>
&gt; brass<br/>
&gt; horn).<br/>
