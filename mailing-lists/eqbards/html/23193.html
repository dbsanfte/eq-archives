<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437733211">There are numerous locations in the game where, due to pathing AI, fear<br/>
kiting is a completely safe tactic.  A good example is by the giant fort in<br/>
Burning Woods.  If you pull a giant to either side of the ramp, snare it and<br/>
then start fearing it, it will just run back and forth while everyone whoops<br/>
up on it.  Now if fear breaks then the giant will of course start attacking<br/>
you.  I have never fear kited in the Overthere location referenced earlier<br/>
but if the mob still attacks you when fear breaks or is resisted, then why<br/>
would using fear kiting in this location be considered an exploit when it<br/>
isn&#39;t in other locations?<br/>

In reference to the fear kite tacticts in OT near the skyfire zone -- move<br/>
to the corner between skyfire and frontier mountains.  If you fear mobs<br/>
there, they run up into the corner and run back and forth mostly up in the<br/>
corner. <br/>
<br/>
I had a gm watch me for about 15 minutes up there one evening.  I asked him<br/>
if he considered it an exploit, and he said &quot;Nope, Great tactics!&quot;  Bear in<br/>
mind that the mob was never just running into a wall, it was always in<br/>
motion, and as long as fear wasnt resisted it stayed on this little path<br/>
where it ran back and forth.<br/>
