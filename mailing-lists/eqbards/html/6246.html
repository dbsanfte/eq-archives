&gt; as jhenders said before, if you get a pull of multiple mobs that would make<br/>

&gt; get out of dodge anyway.  multiple pulls of high level mobs means everyone<br/>
&gt; better concentrate on getting the same mob, one at a time, especially if an<br/>

in tanking ability between you and the other melee classes is<br/>
obvious.  Not only do they have a couple hundred more hp, but<br/>
their parries, blocks, and ripostes really cut down on the<br/>
damage they take.  When fighting in Cazic, the lizards that<br/>
take 20-30 seconds to drop my melee friends by one bubble<br/>
usually do the same to me in just two or three hits.  You do<br/>
*not* want to be playing an area effect damage song that will<br/>
make you the primary recipient of damage from all the mobs the<br/>
group currently isn&#39;t fighting.  If at all possible, let the<br/>
real tanks do the tanking.  The only time I try to take damage<br/>
anymore is if it&#39;s a tough fight (to ease the damage the<br/>
others are taking), I&#39;m the closest thing in the group to a<br/>
tank, or if I&#39;m trying to get a mob off a caster.<br/>
