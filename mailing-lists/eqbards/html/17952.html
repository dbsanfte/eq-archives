<b>Subject:</b> Reed&#39;s Bard Song Spreadsheet v. 1.05 Available. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-161760918">For those who use it, I┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓ve updated my spreadsheet.  Here are the <br/>
changes:<br/>
 - Added songs for level 39 and 45.<br/>
 - Added modifications to Chant series.<br/>
 - Converted Damage that was stored as PvP to nonPvP. <br/>
 - Added Instrument Modifiers at the top of the printout (so<br/>
they┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓re <br/>
on the printed page)<br/>
<br/>
For those who don┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓t know about it, it is an excel spreadsheet<br/>
that <br/>
will calculate the spell effects based upon your level and special <br/>
instruments, as well as indicate which songs/spells a given song <br/>
won┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓t stack with, etc.  Basically, it┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓s a handy reference<br/>
sheet.<br/>
<br/>
You can get it at Rokenn┬Ç┬á┬á&#39;┬▓s Excellent Bard Song Analysis Site:<br/>
