<div id="ygrps-yiv-225193016">I&#39;d say 5p, 1p seems to be the de-facto price for those that do charge,<br/>
you&#39;d still want to encourage player binds over npc binds.<br/>

&gt;&gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a fee, and limit<br/>
&gt;&gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The advantage that the<br/>

&gt;Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., mebbe you could<br/>
&gt;suggest this idea:<br/>
&gt;Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast a &quot;bind&quot; spell on<br/>
&gt;a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and ask the cost for a<br/>
&gt;night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it cost, say 1 plat,<br/>
&gt;players could still undercut the merchants, but other players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together to get bound in<br/>
&gt;certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are inconvenient at<br/>
&gt;best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow travelers to feel<br/>
&gt;safer traveling.<br/>
