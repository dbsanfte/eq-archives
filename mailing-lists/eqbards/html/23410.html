<div id="ygrps-yiv-641172060">Read your comment wrong about stops - but you are still wrong on hunting<br/>
horns.  The Sound is made by &quot;Buzzing&quot; the brass method and they do have<br/>
partials - they are harder to make but there (I&#39;ve tried them out).<br/>
<br/>
The determining factor - for flutes and early winds - the vibration is the<br/>
resistance of the air crossing a blow hole.  The hunting horns are NOT<br/>
played that way.  The shape of the horn is NOT an issue for determining how<br/>
the sound is created, only altered.<br/>

Stops=partials right.  Agreed only brass instruments have them, that&#39;s what<br/>
I said ;-)<br/>
Simple woodwinds have no reeds.  The hunting horn I have really isn&#39;t an<br/>
instrument at all to be honest, but it is the vibrations created inside the<br/>
horn that make the sound you hear.  The different shapes of individual horns<br/>
affects the sounds heard.<br/>

That is not correct.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - if you mean<br/>
&quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments have partials.<br/>
Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how the sound itself<br/>
is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips vibration creates<br/>
the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child - a big day<br/>
for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>
Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>
<br/>
On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>
instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the exception of the<br/>
flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations caused by the<br/>
wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>
<br/>
        A saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>
instrument.<br/>
<br/>
As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>
are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>
This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>
reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>
box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>

Actually it is more correct for it to be a wind instrument.  Brass<br/>
instruments all have stops, wind instruments do not necessarily have them.<br/>
