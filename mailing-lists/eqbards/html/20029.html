<div id="ygrps-yiv-877170376">No offense but all those sites out there with &quot;Priceguides&quot; are worthless. If you want to get an idea what<br/>
something is worth. You MUST only ask around on your server. Other servers vary wildly in pricing.<br/>
<br/>
Those websites get the children posting prices of 250 plat for a item that goes 10K+ on every other<br/>
server. Throws off the pricing.<br/>
<br/>
The way to know that you are getting a good deal?<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself one question. Are you happy with what you are getting?<br/>
<br/>
I always wondered about this new phenomenon on my server called &quot;Price Check on a XXX!!!!!&quot;. It inundates<br/>
the chat channels whenever there is a single auction. Now I know the reason, it&#39;s sites like this one with<br/>
the &quot;Price&quot; of items on it.<br/>
<br/>
You ask later in your post about the value of a Selo&#39;s drum. I refer you to the question above. Are you<br/>
happy with what you are paying for it?<br/>

&gt; My sources ( www.maximumeq.com ) say it&#39;s worth ~20k.  Those same<br/>
&gt; sources say the Jade Mace is worth ~12k.  Face value says, no it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not a good trade. :)  But, consider the Jade Mace is the best Bard<br/>
&gt; wieldable 1HB weapon in the game AND has better dam/delay ratio than<br/>
&gt; the Symphonic Saber and Harmonic Dagger (without the proc).  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; do MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak...<br/>
&gt; Keep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it<br/>
&gt; off. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the<br/>
&gt; trade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a similar note - I&#39;ve acquired an Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword in a<br/>
&gt; trade for a Necklace of Superiority.  The Stats, 2HS 30/43 +15 Wis<br/>
&gt; +25 Mana War/Rng/Pal/SK, have Ranger and Pally written all over it.<br/>
&gt; maximumeq has a value on it at ~30k.  I&#39;m trying to work a trade<br/>
&gt; for &quot;several&quot; high end Bard items, but am having trouble finding<br/>
&gt; anyone with more than 1, lol.  The best I&#39;ve found so far is Singing<br/>
&gt; Steel Gaunts and Selo&#39;s Drum (I&#39;m trying to get 1 more item out of<br/>
&gt; her).  The person I&#39;m working with thinks the Drum is worth the same<br/>
&gt; as an FBSS.  I had the opportunity (without the cash) to buy a Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Drum for 5k awhile ago... Anyone know a real value on this?<br/>

&gt; Cringing at the thought of one more person on Xegony /auction &lt;insert<br/>
&gt; item here&gt; Looking for Bard Items!  :p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Uhh<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is a swarmcaller?  Stats?  No idea what it&#39;s worth without<br/>
&gt; knowing what<br/>
&gt; &gt; it does ;)<br/>
