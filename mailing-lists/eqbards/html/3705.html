<b>Subject:</b> Re: Side effect/Symptom of twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534091260">One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low level<br/>
characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous<br/>
character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work<br/>
hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or deleted<br/>
their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>
anyone else notice this begging?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw the same thing in M59 when I played there.  Newbies begging for <br/>
things.  Very annoying.  When you suggest that they perhaps take the time <br/>
they are spending begging to go kill something and earn their way, they get <br/>
highly insulted.<br/>
<br/>
My Lvl 30 ranger friend actually had one newbie DEMAND he give him his <br/>
armor. (!)<br/>
<br/>
As for twinking, I hate it.  Each of my characters earns their way.  I could <br/>
easily get some very neat stuff for my bard with my lvl 30 druid, but I <br/>
don&#39;t.  That, however, is a personal choice.  I know of many ppl who twink <br/>
their lower level characters.  I suppose in some way, its been earned, since <br/>
the player did take the time to get it, rather than just having it handed to <br/>
them.<br/>
