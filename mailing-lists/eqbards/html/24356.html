<div id="ygrps-yiv-406205485">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I am looking for my last coin to the Nostrolo Tamborine quest and it&#39;s in Kaesora.  Had a guild raid down there last night that ended in tragedy.  We were constantly overwhelmed by mobs down there -- most of the night we had 10 players in the courtyard.  Many deaths -- had a 50th lvl paladin pulling but that didn&#39;t seem to help.  <br/>
Worst of all, in nearly three hours of camping the library I never did see a failed crypt raider on track.  Please give me some advice for the next sortee.<br/>
