<br/>
Aye tis thee truth ye speak! For thee sins I have commited, I shall<br/>
endeavour to repent!<br/>
<br/>
Verily, tis one of the finer elements of our faire community that it gathers<br/>
together such a diverse group of fine folks.  And with such, one needs some<br/>
compassion and understanding of thee different cultures.  Whilst tis true we<br/>
can all speak the common tongue, for some even thee common tongue is not thy<br/>
native tongue.  <br/>
<br/>
And tis true that the very nature of thee beast, yields to thee temptation<br/>
to condense communications, rather than enjoy thee luxury of expounding on<br/>
the beauty of the words themselves. Forsooth, we have these abominations to<br/>
some cultures known as &#39;d00d-isms&#39; And. &#39;tis ironic indeed to resort to use<br/>
of same for chastising another&#39;s use of some &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. sorry could not resist &lt;s&gt; and its lots better than what my first reply<br/>
was gonna be &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. imho, (hehe u prolly don&#39;t like that either) the d00d-isms and EQ<br/>
acronyms _are_ part of the EQ kulture - like em or not - there they are.<br/>
But seriously, I will tone down... &lt;maybe&gt;<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s.s. I play at odd hours and have been with parties who are from all<br/>
over asia: hong kong, taiwan, japan, etc. Some of the EQ&#39;ism&#39;s are a big<br/>
help to communicate with these guys.  They understand &quot;u rock!&quot; lots better<br/>
than &quot;verily, thou dost slew an abominable creature!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s.s.s. My 47th b-day will be Oct 13th (if you want to get me something<br/>
nice, I would like a Crystalline Blade).  Last month, I took back my first<br/>
pair of bifocals because they gave me a bad headache playing EQ and now have<br/>
2 sets of eyeglasses :-)~ <br/>
<br/>
p.s.s.s.s.s. and finally, I will use the old stand-by get out of jail free<br/>
card: &#39;hey, I am just role playing!  My role is a &quot;powergamer&quot;!!&#39; Heheh.<br/>

		I don&#39;t want to offend you, and I realize that this is an<br/>
informal email list<br/>
		for a game, but damn.  Your message was just plain hard to<br/>
read.  Could you<br/>
		please attempt to use more English words and fewer d00disms?<br/>
Some of us are<br/>
		old-timers and it&#39;s really hard to read that while squinting<br/>
through our<br/>
		bifocals.<br/>
