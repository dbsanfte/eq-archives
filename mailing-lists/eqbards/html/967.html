<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970823743">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
This is a repost, I am reposting because my findings are different to <br/>
the Bard spell analysis data. which is at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/magicshop/bardreview.shtml">http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/magicshop/bardreview.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
I updated my conclusions slightly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did some test to find out the efficiency of Jonathans Warsong and <br/>
Anthem de Arms. <br/>
<br/>
First of all I am a 10th level Bard with singing maxed. Dex is <br/>
92(base of 90 with +2 ring). For the test I fought Fire Beetles with <br/>
my fists. I went against Fire Beetles because they are all the same <br/>
level and they dont run away. I used my fists to get more attacks in <br/>
per combat thus giving me a larger sample.<br/>
<br/>
I tested 	1. No song active<br/>
			2. Jonathans Warsong active<br/>
			3. Anthem de Arms active	<br/>
			4. Both song active<br/>
<br/>
The time is the duration of the combat timed with a stop watch.<br/>
Hits is the number of swings during the combat.<br/>
the last number is how many seconds per swing.<br/>
<br/>
The numbers<br/>
				Hits	Time	<br/>
None Active	12		40		3.3<br/>
				15		49		3.26<br/>
<br/>
Jonath Active	15		41		2.73<br/>
				19		53		2.78<br/>
<br/>
Anthem Active	14		40		2.85<br/>
				13		39		3<br/>
				12		35		2.9<br/>
<br/>
Both Active		12		33		2.75<br/>
				15		39		2.6<br/>
				15		40		2.66<br/>
				12		32		2.66<br/>
<br/>
Analysis:<br/>
Your swing rate increases singing these songs. You will get 20% <br/>
more attacks with one or the other song active. <br/>
<br/>
Anthem appears to be slower but remember this is a small sample <br/>
and using a stopwatch is prone to small errors, and I could have <br/>
made a mistake, like misscounted the number of hits. But Anthem <br/>
may be a tad slower than Jonathans like a 15% increase.<br/>
<br/>
looking at the final set of results it appears that the songs do stack <br/>
somewhat, which is interesting. Giving about a 25% increase.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In group situations it is clear what songs to play. I usually play a <br/>
combination of Anthem, Angels and Chords, sometimes I swap <br/>
between all 3. lately I have favouried Chords over Angels.<br/>
<br/>
In a solo situation it is not clear for me yet what songs to play and <br/>
when. Lately I have started playing Chords. When soloing at 10th <br/>
level you have a choice of playing 2 or 3 of the following.<br/>
<br/>
Chant of battle<br/>
Jonathans Warsong<br/>
Chords of Dissonance<br/>
Hymn of Angels<br/>
Anthem de Arms<br/>
<br/>
I used to (before 10th) play Chant, Angels, Jonathans.<br/>
I have now switched to Chords, Jonathans, Anthem or Chords, <br/>
Jonathans, Chant.<br/>
<br/>
It does seem to me(I have no hard data) that Chords can make a <br/>
difference in a close battle, say over Angels?<br/>
<br/>
The after effects of Anthem do not seem to last as long as the <br/>
others this may increase as my singing skill increases.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New conclusions,<br/>
It is possible that these 2 songs get +5% to attack rate every 3 <br/>
levels up to a certain cap.<br/>
<br/>
