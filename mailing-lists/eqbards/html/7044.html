<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383706212"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; and rearrangeable spellbook.  BTW, I&#39;ve already<br/>
&gt; heard from Brad on that one - it would require<br/>
&gt; INCREDIBLE amounts of programming that they can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do right now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I remember the interview that I believe you&#39;re<br/>
referring to they said it would take a lot of work<br/>
but they didn&#39;t make it sound like it was an<br/>
incredible amount. Besides, this is something that<br/>
would be of benefit for EVERY class in EQ except for<br/>
2 or 3. It wouldn&#39;t have any bearing on game balance<br/>
or race/class balance in any way. It would be nothing<br/>
but beneficial.</div>
