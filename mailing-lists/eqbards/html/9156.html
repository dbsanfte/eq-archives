<div id="ygrps-yiv-445865020">I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been grouped<br/>
with a level 9 paladin for a few days (doing a quest) and I will say that if<br/>
I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>
<br/>
The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no way in<br/>
the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did this<br/>
with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally would,<br/>
even if we are grouped.<br/>

&gt;happen).<br/>
&gt;A high level tank will taunt the MOB off a low level character for him to<br/>
&gt;kill it. A high level buffer will buff / heal the low level character.<br/>
&gt;But they have to stay ungrouped or the low level one will get no exp.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I have been told that this is a common method by high level characters to<br/>
&gt;&gt;powerlevel lower level characters.  Like you said, if the mob gives the<br/>
&gt;&gt;higher level character experience, the lower level character will gone<br/>
&gt;&gt;none.<br/>
&gt;&gt;If the mob does not give the higher level character experiece, the lower<br/>
&gt;&gt;level one character will get it all.<br/>
