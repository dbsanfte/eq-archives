&gt; Ok, I&#39;m going to have to ask for even more spoiler. :)  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
&gt; Kithicor a couple of times, and besides some ruins (stonehenge kind) having<br/>
&gt; some rather easy (for a lvl 14 druid, and lvl 14 cleric) mummies and green<br/>
&gt; skels, and occasional green skels that pop up around the lake, we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been able to find any more critters worth beating up on.  A few blue spiders<br/>
&gt; or snakes (can&#39;t remember exactly), few & far between.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are four, possibly five (I still get lost in there at<br/>
times :-), undead spawn locations.  You&#39;ve found two of them.  <br/>
They will occasionally spawn ghouls, or groups of ghouls,<br/>
which are the toughest creatures I&#39;ve seen there.  Four camps<br/>
was enough that I was able to clear them solo one after the<br/>
other in my high teens without any wait.  The experience was<br/>
slow then (only a few ghouls gave me experience), but the nice<br/>
thing is you&#39;ll usually have all four camps to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
In the Southwest corner are four spots where some named<br/>
Shralok orcs appear.  They are sometimes replaced by various<br/>
forest creatures (bats, wolves, fire beetles, etc) and will<br/>
not respawn until you kill the creature.  The orcs seem to<br/>
range from about L13-L17.  They are all named, but I&#39;ve never<br/>
got any special items off them.  The Chief I&#39;ve only killed<br/>
once so it&#39;s possible he carries something. The others I&#39;ve<br/>
killed about a dozen times each.  They usually carry rawhide,<br/>
rusty weapons, and occasionally a bronze weapon.  Please note<br/>
that these are not the Shralok orcs that carry the shiny brass<br/>
halberd and Shralok pack - those are in Highpass.<br/>
<br/>
The zone is probably great between levels 8 to about 15 mainly<br/>
because it&#39;s empty.  Rivervale is just one zone away so you<br/>
can drop by any time to sell off your loot.  From about 14 to<br/>
18 it&#39;ll be a bit slow, as the orcs are slow to respawn.  The<br/>
only thing you really have to fear there is being rooted by a<br/>
ghoul, which bards don&#39;t have to worry about.  That and<br/>
getting lost. :-)  Try to avoid area effect songs until you&#39;re<br/>
familiar with the pattern of some of the wandering NPCs.<br/>
