&gt; The reason for putting a fast weapon in your primary is to<br/>
&gt; raise dual wield skill - a 10 delay weapon would give 60 dual<br/>
&gt; wield checks (and thus chances to improve) every minute.  A<br/>
&gt; 100 delay weapon would only give 6 checks.  If your skill is<br/>
&gt; maxed, this is a non-issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (For those of you who remember, the disagreement JM and I had<br/>
&gt; over this was a matter of definition - he was using dam/delay<br/>
&gt; ratio, I was using average damage over time.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought you both agreed that dual weild checks were based on the<br/>
secondary weapon delay. Have you now changed your mind on this? If the<br/>
check happens when the secondary weapon delay expires then that<br/>
contradicts the first sentance I quoted above.<br/>
<br/>
And, with the typical fight, putting a 10 delay weapon in either hand<br/>
with a bard at high levels, assuming an under one minute fight, would<br/>
probably yeild something like this, assuming all 6 dual weild checks<br/>
succeeded (ya right)<br/>

At least that&#39;s how most of my fights looked. Given the clumpiness of<br/>
the random rolls I&#39;d rather have a lot more chances for hits.<br/>
