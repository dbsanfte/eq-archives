<div id="ygrps-yiv-971668047">Oops. You&#39;re right. I hit a wrong note on that one. Invisibilty isn&#39;t a viable means of escape within evil cities without the flute. However, it does come in handy when in Feerrott or Innothule. Remember, those 5th level lizardman scouts carry the scout fife almost all the time. You just whack one of them hand to hand (easy to do), get their flute and now you can use invisibility for the rest of the trip back.<br/>

I&#39;d like to know how you are able to sing the invis song to get past the<br/>
guards in evil cities.  How do you get your spare flute (required to sing<br/>
invis song) out of the bank? The only way I could see this scenario working<br/>
is if you were bound at the bank of the evil city and the banker/guards in<br/>
the bank don&#39;t attack you on sight.  I have always assumed this was not a<br/>
viable option for non-evil races because the banker and guards in the bank<br/>
would attack you on sight before you had a chance to get your flute.  <br/>

&gt; have it even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or<br/>
&gt; with Selo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the nearest<br/>
&gt; zone (you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past though).<br/>
