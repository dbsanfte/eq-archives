<div id="ygrps-yiv-837138424">Not when I was there.  Maybe 4 people near the entrance and the first large<br/>
room (lots of skels there).<br/>
<br/>
They should have the run of the place.  Just remember that skels are still<br/>
agro at 45 ;)<br/>
<br/>
The skeletons are really nicely spaced out though (the badgers are somewhat<br/>
more clumped together), so if they stay with skeletons, they shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
much problems as long as they kill and keep moving.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Excellent info, thanks.  One of our lower levels is a druid so he will<br/>
&gt; probably be interested as he&#39;s wearing leather right now I think.  Most of<br/>
&gt; the people who might be interested aren&#39;t really twinked, but they might<br/>
&gt; have an item or two from higher level guildmembers.  If we do it I&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; more of a bopdyguard and observer than actually looking for loot myself<br/>
&gt; other than a recipe for that darned cake.  Was it very crowded?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots of quest loot, lots of bones. Money.<br/>
&gt; We didn&#39;t find anything oh-aw spiffy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, all three of those of us in there were item-twinked.<br/>
&gt; There was one magical item (BUrnyai Hide Sleeves) we got<br/>
&gt; off a greenie skeleton. Our monk could wear it, but<br/>
&gt; decided not to. i believe Druids could wear it too, so<br/>
&gt; bards probably could.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Anyone know if there is any interesting loot in Kurn&#39;s tower?  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking it might be a good place to look for Burynai Bundt Cake.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Also some<br/>
&gt; &gt;of my guilds lower level member were thinking of trying it.<br/>
