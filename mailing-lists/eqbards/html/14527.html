<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259284159">everyone noticed the breath right away, as we have killed him with 24 ppl<br/>
every time for the last couple months, and i don&#39;t remember any failed<br/>
attempts.  our cleric went OOM fast, and everyone in the bard groups were<br/>
getting pounded regardless of FR.  we heard something about a 200+ bug, so<br/>
after everyone being 200+ on the first attempt, we tried just under 200 on<br/>
the 2nd and same result.  i think with more healers and tanks we&#39;d have no<br/>
problem with 30 ppl, but i think only a super-balanced group of 24 can do<br/>
him now.<br/>
<br/>
and yes selo&#39;s drum is dangerous, not only for people in your grop but even<br/>
for us.  started from oasis at full health and made it to lava druid ring at<br/>
1/2 bubb ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; tried nagafen since patch?  his breath is now outrageously <br/>
&gt; powerful, or FR<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t do crap anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Killed him on Tuesday and Thursday, didn&#39;t notice much of a difference<br/>
&gt; between times, but then there were around 40 people there both times.<br/>
&gt; Never got feared, debuffs hit the useless ones (CR, PR, UV) <br/>
&gt; and songs, and<br/>
&gt; yeah the breath hurt.  Base FR prior to buff/song was 116, <br/>
&gt; level 49 bard,<br/>
&gt; breath did a few hundred each application.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that I have Selo&#39;s drum, weaving Rhythms with my default gear on<br/>
&gt; boosts MR to 267.  Gotta be careful showing others how fast <br/>
&gt; Accelerando is<br/>
&gt; though, especially in Lavastorm. -.-<br/>
