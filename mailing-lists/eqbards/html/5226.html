&gt;&gt;Give me a noncombatant role any day of the week.<br/>

&gt;Uh... In EQ there really isn&#39;t much non combat (Trade Skills), and what<br/>
&gt;minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>
&gt;of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>
&gt;would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>
&gt;NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>
&gt;ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>
&gt;get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>
&gt;diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>
&gt;get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>
&gt;it fun to do so much!<br/>
