<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267048303">I got this thing ages ago by accident. An old druid friend of mine always <br/>
comes upon rare to semi-rare spawns (damn druids), and he just impules kites <br/>
them, even if he has no hope of killing them. He kited Broog Bloodbeard for <br/>
30 minutes while he called us for help. =P<br/>
Anyways, he saw Equestrielle and tried to kite it. He got smacked down prety <br/>
hard, and we went over to res him. Before we reached his corpse I caught <br/>
Equestrielle on track, and we killed it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t used the Purge ability, but I&#39;m guessing it probably works like <br/>
pillage enchantment. Or maybe it pillages just harmful effects *shrug*, <br/>
similar to the Cleanse effect of the Shining Star of Light. Thank you for <br/>
posting about this. I never tried any tests with it, and did not know it <br/>
slightly enhanced pixie strike. This tells me that the instrument SHOULD be <br/>
useful for our expansion song 53 (Song of Twilight). Hopefully, it will <br/>
further reduce MR over what a store bought flute could do. We&#39;ll see what <br/>
happens.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Unicorn Horn<br/>
&gt;Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2000 12:53:39 -0700<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Greetings,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other day My 45th bard was grouped with a wiz old friend. He said he <br/>
&gt;ran<br/>
&gt;into some unicorn and killed it a while back and that he got a &quot;unicorn<br/>
&gt;horn&quot;  but didnt know if it was special or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I told him give it to me ill do a quick test ( we were in lower guk so <br/>
&gt;didnt<br/>
&gt;want to waste To much time).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well first I fired up Invis with it and it was a wind instrament. So then I<br/>
&gt;pixie striked my self 3 times to watch the MR lower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. No instrament my mr loweres 8<br/>
&gt;2. Normal Wood Flute my mr lowers14 points<br/>
&gt;3. Unicorn horn my mr lowers 17 points ( average like 22% increase or<br/>
&gt;someting )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have a 50th necro and been bored with the game a bit . But my<br/>
&gt;question is, well no question. Is there anymore to this horn? I actually<br/>
&gt;have never heard of it and those are all the tests I did with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just want to know if anyone else knows anymore about this horn. Possible<br/>
&gt;other uses for it and also what Purge spell is ( it has 5 charges)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also this has no hand graphic on me wood elf bard. It does do the Piper<br/>
&gt;Animation though :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks ahead of time.<br/>
