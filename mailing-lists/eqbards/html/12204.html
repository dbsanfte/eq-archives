<div id="ygrps-yiv-980294675">Off the top of my head the ONE place I can think of that you will RARELY see <br/>
anything except purely magic-based attacks (no cold/fire/poison/disease) is <br/>
in Cazic Thule, where the majority of casting mobs are clerics lizards. You <br/>
will get smitten, and wrathed aplenty, and occasionally HTed by Crusaders.<br/>
<br/>
While in PoH or PoF I tend to stack either elemental rhythms with guardian <br/>
rhythms or switch out elemental with purifying depending on the mob. If it&#39;s <br/>
a pure melee mob I&#39;ll just use battle songs. If lag permits I&#39;ll melee with <br/>
the rest of the group, but if we have a LOT of ppl in the zone (which is too <br/>
typical of a planes raid) I&#39;d rather just turn my back on the group and play <br/>
resists/battle songs with a drum - and I never get complaints for it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;At 29th level, I have all the rhythm based songs as well as the Psalm of<br/>
&gt;Warmth and Vitality.  Up until this point, when I want to buff resist rates<br/>
&gt;because my group is fighting a caster, I have always chosen to sing a <br/>
&gt;Rhythm<br/>
&gt;based song with drums instead of the Psalms.  From my experience, caster<br/>
&gt;mobs seem to have a restricted spell book, casting no more than 3 or 4<br/>
&gt;different spells in any combat.  Of the 3-4 spells they will cast, it seems<br/>
&gt;that only two different spell realms will be used, i.e. either magic based<br/>
&gt;or one of the other areas (i.e. fire/cold/disease/poison).  IMO, it seems<br/>
&gt;safer to hedge your bets and boost resist rates in three realms with the<br/>
&gt;rhythm series versus only one with the Psalm series.  Will that 6 point<br/>
&gt;difference (Psalm @ 51- Rhythm w/drum @ 45) really make that much of a<br/>
&gt;difference?  It would if the mob only casted spells from one realm but how<br/>
&gt;often does that happen?  This scenario assumes you don&#39;t have to tank the<br/>
&gt;mobs and can equip a drum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are a tank by default and have to equip your weapons, IMO you still<br/>
&gt;come out better singing a rhythm song instead of a Psalm.  You will <br/>
&gt;increase<br/>
&gt;resist rates by a total of 75 (25 in each realm).  Since mob casters tend <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;only use two realms of magic, you only get to use 50 of the extra resist<br/>
&gt;points but that is still on par with what the Psalm will give you (51).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only time I use a Psalm is to get the damage shield when we are <br/>
&gt;fighting<br/>
&gt;a melee mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is my rationale on song selection on track or am I missing out on <br/>
&gt;something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
