&gt;   question whether I can take X mob, or what song should I play.<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s just the same button mashing over and over.  If you see<br/>
&gt;   3 LDCs, you just zone, no questions asked.  Definitely not<br/>
&gt;   the harrier who was almost 10 levels higher than me, who  <br/>
&gt;   after slaying gave me the warm feeling inside I used to get<br/>
&gt;   when an accomplishment was made.  No, higher level life is<br/>
&gt;   either really easy (boring) -or- really hard (frustrating).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s a problem I see with the game too.  Verant, in<br/>
their zeal to make things difficult at higher levels to slow<br/>
us down, has so narrowed the margin between easy and hard that<br/>
there&#39;s very little room in there for good tactics to make a<br/>
difference anymore.  At lower levels, you could take on a<br/>
close fight and good tactics could make the difference between<br/>
barely winning, or realizing halfway through that you&#39;re going<br/>
to lose and running.  At higher levels, the margin is so slim<br/>
that the luck of the die rolls can easily swamp out the effect<br/>
of good tactics, and you&#39;ll die before you can run.  So you<br/>
resort to doing the easier fights, which don&#39;t require good<br/>
tactics and tend to be rather boring.<br/>
