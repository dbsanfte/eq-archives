<b>Subject:</b> Teleporting mobs - anyone see this yet? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-483758210">I just read on Stratics that they have added the code they had on test<br/>
server that causes mobs who can&#39;t reach you due to pathing problems to<br/>
be able to teleport to you. However, the article on Stratics said it<br/>
happened to a party in lower guk, where a group of mobs teleported into<br/>
a room with one. As our AE songs are likely to set off mobs in other<br/>
parts of the dungeon more than anything anyone else can do, I was<br/>
wondering if anyone has seen mobs mysteriously teleport into a fight<br/>
anywhere yet.<br/>
