Personally, Im getting tired of your posts on this topic.  Every one of<br/>
them says the same thing: low and mid levels aren&#39;t worthy to lick high<br/>
level&#39;s boots, high levels are the Gods, and should be treated as such (my<br/>
loose, but, i think, accurate interpretation of your posts here).  You&#39;re<br/>
high level, live with the consequenses.  No one promised you endless<br/>
excitement, perfect hunting zones, and new territories at level 50.  You<br/>
knew, pretty much from the start, that level 50 was the pinnacle.  You&#39;ve<br/>
reached the end (well maybe not the end, but more like a pause, until the<br/>
expansion comes out) of your journey in EQ.  Why not do a little bit of<br/>
exploring now?  Im sure you haven&#39;t seen ALL of Norrath.  Why, the last few<br/>
days have been quite enjoyable for me, hiding out in Runnyeye, exploring<br/>
the parts of it (still going in invis tho) that I was too afraid to see<br/>
when I was of &quot;proper&quot; level to hunt there.  Found a merchant (wouldn&#39;t<br/>
sell to me, go figure), a banker (killed one before I thought to try and<br/>
actually &quot;bank&quot; there!-- it works!), a really nifty Slime Elemental that<br/>
was a little tricky to get to at first, and a gelatinous cube that I have<br/>
yet to find, as well as some underwater passageways that I still have yet<br/>
to explore.  Also, try trade skills, or doing some RP events for your<br/>
guild, or just enjoying the company of the friends you have made in EQ.  <br/>
Oh, and another thing: puh-lease trim your messages to the smallest amount<br/>
of quoting possible.  Its only good netiquette.<br/>
Can we have a plonk or kabong or something on this thread here?<br/>

Heh that was 2 months ago roughly I guess when  he stated that the majority<br/>
had a 30-40 level char. By now it&#39;s easily up to 35-45 probably higher. So<br/>
no your wrong and again their aren&#39;t problems at mid level you just want<br/>
something to be added for it for the hell of it we don&#39;t we want it to be<br/>
less crowded and able to hunt in zones.<br/>
