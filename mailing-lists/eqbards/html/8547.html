 </span></blockquote>I got mine just from a typical loot order system (no lottoing), both of em, <br/>
and only took a few days. Got mithril from guild FG hunts (many, MANY <br/>
hunts). Most of the 45+ bards on Veeshan are dual-wielding Ykeshas. FBSS? <br/>
The Frenzy would be happy to hand one over IF he happened to have one on my <br/>
turn in loot order (hasn&#39;t happened yet, but i&#39;ll still keep trying).<br/>
