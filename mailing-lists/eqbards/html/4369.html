<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071469096"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, but this particular dagger is better than a<br/>
&gt; combine longsword. Same damage, better speed, and<br/>
&gt; buffs as well. probably less weight, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quite a bargain<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought my combine for 30pp.. Someone wants 75pp for the dagger.. I&#39;m sorry<br/>
I can&#39;t recall the exact specs on the Dirk at the moment, but I don&#39;t<br/>
believe they&#39;re worth 45pp (or even 20+pp if you had bought the CLS from a<br/>
gypsy for 50pp). But then again, that&#39;s just my opinion. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
start an off topic thread on weapons and such. =)</div>
