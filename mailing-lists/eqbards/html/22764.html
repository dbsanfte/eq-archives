<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234453933">That was me who posted it.  If you are the only person attacking the mob,<br/>
then you SHOULD be the only one on its hate list.  So when camping the noble<br/>
in Sol B, when we knew he (or the PH) was about to spawn, I would stand near<br/>
his spawn spot and everyone would move away.  When he spawned, since I was<br/>
closest he would automatically attack me first.  They don&#39;t always cast<br/>
charm right off the bat, but in my experience its usually always near the<br/>
beginning of the fight.  When fighting evil eyes, I would pull instead of<br/>
the primary puller.<br/>

Woohoo!  Congrats!<br/>
<br/>
Also, please excuse the dumb newbie question, but in the thread about mobs<br/>
that charm, someone said they put away their weapons and get the mob to<br/>
charm them first, figuring they&#39;re the least threatening potential pet in<br/>
their group.  My question is, how do you get the mob to charm you rather<br/>
than someone else?  Are you just punching away at it, waiting for it to try<br/>
the charm spell, before anyone else joins in?  Do mobs that charm<br/>
consistently cast this at the start of battles?<br/>
<br/>
