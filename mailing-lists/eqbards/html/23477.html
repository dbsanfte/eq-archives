<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094009721">LOL, actually the group decided to give it to me with no lotto.  As the<br/>
battle in dropped in was pretty hairy.  We had a bit of auto-pull, combined<br/>
with the hand room spawning on us.  I was doing constant CC for nearly<br/>
30mins of non-stop fighting, keeping anywhere from 1 to 4 mobs mezzed at a<br/>
time.  So they felt I had earned it =)<br/>
