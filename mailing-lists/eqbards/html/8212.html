<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356575160">Day of the week to play:<br/>
    Preferably evening when I don&#39;t have a gig.  I do like the non-crowded<br/>
aspect of weekdays - but I SHOULD be doing programming work (as I haven&#39;t<br/>
been making as much in the music biz as I used to &lt;sigh&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 Time of day:<br/>
        see above<br/>
<br/>
 Longest stretch of continuous play:<br/>
        about 12 on a weekend a couple of times<br/>
<br/>
 Way to have game sounds:<br/>
<br/>
        Pretty low - but maybe lowder now that I got those SB-Live tips.<br/>
Had to keep it low when I first got the games &#39;cause my two cats freaked at<br/>
the Spider sounds - but they&#39;re used to it now<br/>
<br/>
 Distance to sit from display:<br/>
<br/>
       Hehe grabbed my tape measure 26.5 inches (21&quot; monitor baby!)<br/>
<br/>
 TV show to have on:<br/>
<br/>
       I almost always have TV on - anything heavily dialog based so I don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about looking at it.  I&#39;d say &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot; on HBO has<br/>
to be the best..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Music to listen to:<br/>
<br/>
    Been listening to a lot of James Brown these days - but I&#39;m mostly a<br/>
jazz guy and listen to a lot Classical.<br/>
  Berlioz Symphony Fantastique would be pretty cool  in Unrest<br/>
<br/>
 Beverage (non-alcoholic):<br/>
<br/>
    Diet Coke and LOTS of it!<br/>
<br/>
 Beverage (alcoholic):<br/>
     When I&#39;m out drinking (and on gigs) I prefer Vodka-Tonics (Ketel One or<br/>
Skye preferably).  But I don&#39;t drink much at home.  I used to drink beer at<br/>
home - but my taste for beer has diminshed substantially after I made the<br/>
mistake of spending a month in Europe.  Even microbrews are pretty mediocre<br/>
in comparison.  And exported brew - why do they have to put the &quot;suck&quot; in it<br/>
before shipping it to the USA?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Health Food:<br/>
<br/>
    The closest I get to health food is the baked potato chips they sell at<br/>
the &quot;Healthy&quot; Grocery stores.  Kettle Chips Rock!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Junk Food:<br/>
<br/>
       Does Ben & Jerry&#39;s New York Super Fudge Chunk count as junk food?<br/>
<br/>
 Clothes to wear:<br/>
<br/>
        Shorts and T-Shirts.  When the weather gets cold I&#39;ll crank the<br/>
thermostat !<br/>
