<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663372754">I&#39;m surprised no on has responded to this.  As much as I agree with 99 pct<br/>
of what Harmonic posts; and I agree with much of the post - on some points<br/>
he&#39;s off base here.  Perhaps what you say is true on your server (not sure<br/>
what that is) - but it just isn&#39;t true on Xegony.  Perhaps it&#39;s only<br/>
slightly inaccurate; in that my perspective is that of 33 Bard (perhaps the<br/>
number 35 is high - but I know people in my guild in the late 20&#39;s aren&#39;t<br/>
having it that great either)<br/>
<br/>
The overcrowding problem is a very serious one at my level.  Perhaps it is<br/>
much WORSE for higher levels - but it&#39;s a fallacy to state that because my<br/>
problem is worse - you don&#39;t have a problem...<br/>

&gt;   crowded there&#39;s a reason, it&#39;s too damn hard.  It&#39;s not like I<br/>
&gt;   can pickup 4 or 5 people and hit the planes, we&#39;d be massacred.<br/>
&gt;   There&#39;s really no where to go with other L50 people on a regular<br/>
&gt;   basis to get exp and have fun that doesn&#39;t take a week to organize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with all of this and the rest of the comments about what a 50 CAN do<br/>
that I&#39;m snipping<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I find points to disagree with<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m sorry if you L1 - L35 people are offended by all this talk.<br/>
<br/>
No offense, disagreement...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I had a great time up to L35, there was nothing wrong with the<br/>
&gt;   game then, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it now.  Permafrost<br/>
&gt;   is *still* empty each night, &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost takes a significant amount of time to get to.  That&#39;s the primary<br/>
reason it&#39;s underutilized.  However - you could argue - and you&#39;d be correct<br/>
that it&#39;s just laziness; especially for a group with a bard with selo&#39;s.<br/>
However - as you pointed out - you don&#39;t always have time to organize a big<br/>
event - sometimes we&#39;re on for only 45 or 60 or 90 minutes - and the<br/>
overhead time of organizing a group and travelling to get to Perma can be<br/>
25-50 pct of that time period before you get there and in the spot you want<br/>
to hunt/camp.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;so is Sola.  Unrest is no more crowded<br/>
&gt;   than it was when I was little, same with highkeep.<br/>
<br/>
On Xegony you&#39;re quite wrong here.  Most of the times I&#39;ve gone to Sola -<br/>
it&#39;s been completely packed.  Every good spawn point taken.  I couldn&#39;t get<br/>
into a group... Incidents of groups fighting over the spots.  Even with that<br/>
as a given; I have a few guild members - good players not dummies - who are<br/>
gun-shy of going there due to 4+ hour corpse retreival.   I try to point<br/>
out - &quot;now that you know you&#39;re unlikley to make the same mistake&quot; but they<br/>
don&#39;t listen.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I don&#39;t understand your point on Unrest and Highkeep;  But it sounds<br/>
to me you are saying it&#39;s not a problem because it was always a problem.  On<br/>
Xegony at least - those zones are always beyond completely packed.  When I<br/>
was in my mid 20&#39;s - I recall waiting for 45+ for a group in Highkeep.  Same<br/>
with Unrest.  I&#39;ve seen 90-100 there on many occaisions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The game is<br/>
&gt;   fine for lower level people.<br/>
<br/>
Xegony with 2200+ ppl a night is not by any possible legitimate standard<br/>
&quot;fine&quot; for lower level people. Fennin and Karana are worse.  There are<br/>
serveral other servers that routinely have over 2000+<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not fine for higher level people.<br/>
&gt;   We need about 3-4 more zones just for higher level people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I won&#39;t dispute that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   A big problem I noticed that is L25-L30 people popping into lguk<br/>
&gt;   and solb, and hogging space that a higher level person should<br/>
&gt;   be utilizing.<br/>
<br/>
I also won&#39;t dispute that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Those people below L35 have plenty of outlets<br/>
&gt;   for experience, instead the come to solb/lguk because that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   where everyone is.  To those people, I wish they would go to<br/>
&gt;   Paw or hunt in Rathe Mountains.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the most part you&#39;re right about Paw - but when the server is totally<br/>
packed (Sunday nights and other extremely popular times) it&#39;s been<br/>
completely backed on Xegony as well.  The other problem with Paw is that<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s TOO empty and dangerous to try to be the group that breaks<br/>
in.  It again becomes the issue you talked about for planes where you need<br/>
to organize several groups...<br/>
<br/>
Rathe can be a joke at times.  I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time there lately<br/>
and sometimes it&#39;s great.  Other times - it has been so overpacked it&#39;s not<br/>
funny.  Spent a 45 minute period where with a full group averaged at 34 and<br/>
we saw two, count &#39;em, two Hill Giants.  Two pullers out and constants<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s one - no someone else got it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   The new zones I suggested should be level capped at L40+ to enter,<br/>
&gt;   anyone lower than that is simply not allowed in.  It&#39;s not fair,<br/>
&gt;   I know -- but that&#39;s too bad, 80% of the rest of the world has<br/>
&gt;   easy exp for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everything until the last half of that second sentence.  It<br/>
ain&#39;t easy if we spend the majority of our time waiting for spawn because<br/>
there are just too damned many people on the friggin server!<br/>
<br/>
There is absolutely a need for the higher level zones - and for those zones<br/>
let&#39;s keep them for the people they are designed for - but also we need to<br/>
get the older servers less crowded.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Most people don&#39;t realize I don&#39;t get exp from 90% of the kobolds<br/>
&gt;   in solb, and I&#39;d say 75% of the frogs in lguk no longer give exp.<br/>
&gt;   But there is a group of L39s barely, and I mean barely holding the<br/>
&gt;   bat room in solb, who simply refuse to let L50s in because they<br/>
&gt;   are too high, and will &#39;steal&#39; too much exp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well - a lot of the bad blood between people at my level group and the 50&#39;s<br/>
is caused by some arrogant 50&#39;s - who are probably a minority of people at<br/>
that level.  They act like that they own the game and we have to bend at<br/>
their will.  Case in point - I was with a group in the temple at Cazic<br/>
Thule.  The area was completely spawned - and we had a really good group<br/>
that slowly and systematically was clearing our way to the top.  Just as we<br/>
cleared the last mob before we get to the top - two 50&#39;s (one was a Druid I<br/>
forget the other) run right past us and claim the top and start blasting<br/>
away at 4 mobs at the enterence.  They get into a big arguement with others<br/>
in my group (I keep my mouth shut in these cases) and basically laugh at us<br/>
and tell us to get lost - tough luck...<br/>
<br/>
We all have experienced this - and some feel that turnabout is fair play.<br/>
Other less blatant cases is having full parties have to share spawn with a<br/>
solo 50 camping for an item they want to tweak another character.  Is it<br/>
fair for a group of 6 to get 50 pct of the spawn vs an individual getting<br/>
the other 50?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Verant needs to start looking into the future.  The expansion<br/>
&gt;   will offer no great significance to me, I am thinking.  4 or 5<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - in summary - just because there are plenty of places to hunt; and<br/>
better and simpler and easier to implement solutions than adding new zones;<br/>
there IS a serious overcrowding problem on my server.  It needs to be<br/>
addressed.<br/>
<br/>
Splitting existing servers is probably the best and easiest solution.  Let&#39;s<br/>
get it done!<br/>

PS Made a good amount of experience last night in Rathe Mounting at the Ogre<br/>
camp- but only because I logged on at 12:30 AM and stayed to 2:45 AM..<br/>
Little chance I could have camped that if I had logged on at 8:00 PM </span></blockquote></div>
