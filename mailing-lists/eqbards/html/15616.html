For those who use it, I&#39;ve got a new updated bard song analysis<br/>
spread sheet out.  You can get it at Rokynn&#39;s wonderful sight: <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know of it, it is song list reference that I use<br/>
when playing my bard.  You type in your level, as well as enter the<br/>
statistics for any magical instruments you are using, and it will<br/>
give you numerical values of each of your songs.<br/>
<br/>
It also shows known song stacking problems with other songs and<br/>
spells (which I think I use the most!)<br/>
<br/>
Changes in this version are:<br/>
Fixed changes to Psalm of Warmth and Cooling.  Added Instrument bonus<br/>
reference.  Added level 47 song.  Added Numbers for Selo&#39;s.  For<br/>
levels beyond your current level, numbers are calculated for the<br/>
level that you can first play the song (so you can see what it&#39;s<br/>
going to do when you get to that level).  Fixed level 30 percussion<br/>
effects (bug).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
