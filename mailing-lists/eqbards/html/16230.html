&gt; Fear lets dot&#39;s do full instead of 2/3 damage.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; pretty significantly more than survival time, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; increased damage over time in addition to the reduced<br/>

fearing vs. tanking.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Since necros are regularly able to solo some of the <br/>
&gt; &gt;toughest mobs in the game (outside of the planes), <br/>
&gt; &gt;that means any group with a necro will be able to <br/>
&gt; &gt;take on the toughest mobs in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I disagree, a necro can still solo the ghoul lord room<br/>
&gt; with FD and pet where adding more people (unless they<br/>
&gt; had FD as well) would only hurt.  The above statement<br/>
&gt; is true for most instances but not quite all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That doesn&#39;t contradict what I said.  Adding an extra person<br/>
does not make the group any worse than the necro solo.  Sure<br/>
the extra person may just sit at the sidelines and watch, but<br/>
it&#39;s still as effective as the necro soloing (in terms of<br/>
killing, not in terms of exp).<br/>
