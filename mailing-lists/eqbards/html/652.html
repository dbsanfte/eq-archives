<div id="ygrps-yiv-942877446">I highly suggest you avoid beholder & runny eye, and go thru Highpass<br/>
Hold.<br/>
During peak hours, you can walk thru HH unscathed. There are plenty of<br/>
lvl 20 players camping all the orcs and gnolls that spawn there. Its so<br/>
safe, you could even look around and explore a bit. Why would you want<br/>
to risk going thru beholder and getting attacked by 10 things? And then<br/>
attempting to outrun them? You&#39;re not going to out run a damn thing when<br/>
you&#39;re stunned. And if an evil eye happens to cross you, you&#39;re screwed.<br/>
It&#39;ll either nuke you to hell (can&#39;t out run nukes) or it&#39;ll charm you,<br/>
and let some muddites or minotaurs munch on you. Minotaurs hit HARD, and<br/>
Muddites can blind you.<br/>
Thats not even the worst part. If you were to die, you&#39;d have one hell<br/>
of a corpse retrieval. You might be able to get someone to invis you,<br/>
but evil eyes can detect invis (I think).<br/>
Also its quicker to go thru HH. East Karanas to HH to Kithicor VS. East<br/>
Karanas to Beholder to Runny Eye to Misty to Rivervale to Kithicor.<br/>
I&#39;ve been thru both ways many, many times and I must say HH is the way<br/>
to go. With accelerando, it takes less than 1 minutes to get thru HH.<br/>
Beholder is a longer walk, not to mention more dangerous.</div>
