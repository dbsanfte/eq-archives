<div id="ygrps-yiv-838795879">I am a fashion disaster. Last night was something, I started the night<br/>
looking like a wood elf wearing chain (with silvery bracers depending on<br/>
what order I dressed) and wound up...well you will see.<br/>
<br/>
With my list of suggestions from Draelon Stormsong in a position of honor by<br/>
my monitor I started out for Mistmoore. But GFay being the Outlet mall of<br/>
Norrath I saw a Skull shaped barbutte for 250 (ended up paying 235 to the<br/>
*very* nice seller) it was on the list! So...quickly raising funds from the<br/>
200 I had I bought it. . I swapped order on the wrists so they would<br/>
show...looking good. THEN an old guildmate /tells me he has all the goods<br/>
for lambent legs and will bring em to me...I have no money left (for the<br/>
gems) but he will accept my chared boots in trade (plus credit towards the<br/>
next few pieces he also has parts for). He then gives me bronze boots to<br/>
replace the charred.<br/>
<br/>
If the Worst Dressed awards were given today I am confident I could beat<br/>
Cher.<br/>
