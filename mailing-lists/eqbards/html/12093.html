&gt; Repairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>

I think the faction is great. I&#39;m up to kindly with the dwarf guards now<br/>
and the merchants in Quenos love me too. The corrupt guards are all<br/>
pretty low level (I&#39;ve heard Kane Bayle, leader of the guards, is a lot<br/>
nastier but I&#39;ve never actually seen him) so they aren&#39;t really that<br/>
much of a concern after L15 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, after L20 or so, how often do you go to Quenos?<br/>
