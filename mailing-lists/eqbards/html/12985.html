<br/>
Still licking my wounds from last night.  2 bubs of level 41 gone and<br/>
welcome back to hell! Grrr bark bark Grrr.<br/>
<br/>
We had about 8 hi 30 to mid 40&#39;s, 2 rogues, 1 necro 30s, no enchanter,<br/>
tanks, a 50 puller, 1 bard - me (ugh - I know but we were brave!).  We<br/>
cleared in through the secret room and the tower and bedroom.  Really,<br/>
really fun. We worked our way into the castle and the room at the foot of<br/>
the stairs? near some double doors.  Our 50 puller was able to fetch us<br/>
stuff fairly nicely. 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s mostly.  He cleared stuff and finally was<br/>
able to pull Mynthi to us.  She stopped just inside the double doors and we<br/>
rushed her.  We killed her and she forked over some drums (only 2 of the 8<br/>
had any interest so they randomed and the necro&#39;s bard twink is now very<br/>
nicely twinked.)<br/>
<br/>
Then we got a fairly hard pull. A gypsy musician is in the pull and goes<br/>
down.  I died in the battle and don&#39;t know if there was a gypsy lute on her.<br/>
Everyone else lived and one comment was &quot;holy cow!  I lived thru that???&quot; I<br/>
got ressed back but unfortunately not by a high level cleric.  A 30ish<br/>
cleric and red to me at 41 enchanter were working the same room we were in.<br/>
<br/>
And then the leader says &quot;invis (caster invis not bard invis) up and go thru<br/>
those doors make a left and into the garden.&quot;  &quot;Ugh - not the garden!!,&quot; I<br/>
say.  In we go and we get aggro&#39;d in the room before the garden.  I get<br/>
stunned, spun and see what looks like a way out so I run for it.  Then I get<br/>
stunned again and die again and gnid back to 40. Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
They drag me to the zone and I am talking to a guild 50 cleric about getting<br/>
ressed and the yes/no screen pops up.  So, I click &#39;yes&#39; and guess what?<br/>
Yup, the same friendly but only 30ish cleric saw me and ressed me without<br/>
asking.  Ya, ya, I leave a res corpse and wait for my 50 clr and he<br/>
re-resses me - I get the message &quot;you have reclaimed experience&quot; but it&#39;s<br/>
not visible on my xp bar and I am still level 40.<br/>
<br/>
So, that is now my 4th time in MM.  First was a lake group when I was level<br/>
19 - really good xp. Second was a trip to the garden at 39. Died that time<br/>
too. Then last weekend, in the secret room was good and did not die - that<br/>
made me brave. And finally a tour of part of the interior.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to learn more about MM and think that harmony or lulling areas then<br/>
fighting for a room is the way to handle it.  Pulling out the front door is<br/>
not a good tactic.  We learned that the hard way.  Also, enchanter(s) and<br/>
clerics are required if a group is going to go in.  Ya, ya, we all know that<br/>
50 druids can go in and easily kill them then you sneak in invis and loot -<br/>
but what fun is that? Ok, fun for the 2 of you but having a couple groups<br/>
clearing the castle and fighting inside - is great fun when you win!   <br/>
