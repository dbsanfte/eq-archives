<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939249870">I can only chat up the barkeeps and Innkeepers.  Because they&#39;re the only real<br/>
women in Norrath :P<br/>

Um, except my wife...who I hope doesn&#39;t see this...<br/>

You forgot my favorite time slice, and that&#39;s chatting up the women.<br/>
  I put aside an hour or two each day to sing to all the girls, and<br/>
  tell the tales of Harmonic who single handedly defeated Cazic Thule,<br/>
  how he slashed Maestro with his 6-note blade, how he can solo the Lord<br/>
  Room with his helmet visor down.<br/>
<br/>
  Now that&#39;s quality time.<br/>
