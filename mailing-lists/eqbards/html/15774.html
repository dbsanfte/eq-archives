<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698341511">I&#39;d have to say though that the best approach to solving the lava corpse<br/>
problem is not to fall in though :-).  I did maybe 30 corpse recoveries from<br/>
the Lava in my time in Sol A (none of them people in my party).<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it is a bit easier then described.  Most important, you need a<br/>
levitate.  If you have to recover someone elses corpse, target it with your<br/>
corpse locater song and then step off, hit your /corpse button and<br/>
immediately step back onto the stairs.  You should be able to get the corpse<br/>
onto the stairs before you float down far enough to not be able to get back<br/>
up.  If it is your corpse you can skip the song/target routine.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, see if you can get a guide to pull it out, but in my<br/>
experience guides are very poorly kept up on current policy, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
expect help there.<br/>
<br/>
Other bugs in Sol A other then the &quot;corpse lost in a wall&quot; bug is the<br/>
infamous invisability bug where you can&#39;t see some of your party members or<br/>
they can&#39;t see you.  This is usually easily fixed by camping or zoning and<br/>
coming back.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly if you are in the Safe Room pulling, keep an eye out for &quot;train&quot;<br/>
messages from the Bar or from the Kings room.  If someone messes up in<br/>
either one of those areas, they are quite likely coming your way with<br/>
infernos or soluseks in tow.  There is a bridge in the room above the safe<br/>
room where we found you can stand and let the train pass beneath you.  When<br/>
the train starts heading home, we&#39;d often pull the last 1 or 2 goblins which<br/>
usually were damaged :-).<br/>

&gt; 	You&#39;re wrong about guide&#39;s not helping with corpses in lava.  I<br/>
&gt; spoke with a guide recently who told me that in the past few weeks there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; been a change to where all corpses in lava are considered irretrievable<br/>
&gt; (meaning they will move it out of the lava for you).<br/>
