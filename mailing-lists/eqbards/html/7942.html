<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058167535">LOL.  I personally would wear them, you earned them :-)  And<br/>
yes, women do get very preferential treatment I think.  I have stayed out of<br/>
the whole binding argument because I have never had a problem getting bound.<br/>
Ever.  Because my character is female, all I&#39;ve ever had to do is walk up to<br/>
a group and ask &quot;will one of you please bind me.&quot;  My warrior friend can<br/>
shout for HOURS and have no response.  I&#39;ve also been given numerous items<br/>
because I&#39;m &quot;cute.&quot;  Is this fair?  No. But then again, men don&#39;t have to<br/>
put up with tells from strangers who want to know if they like to be spanked<br/>
:P<br/>

				I will probably regret sending this mail ..<br/>
Please remember this is my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ<br/>
for about 2 months now, so many of these comcepts are still new to me<br/>
(Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I have read the Glossary so I<br/>
understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>
<br/>
				Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and<br/>
was grouped with a very high level player, I did not understand the EXP<br/>
share problem. He just asked me to keep singing my heal song and he would<br/>
look after me, I grouped with him for several hours and didnt get any exp.<br/>
Anyway when I asked him about this he said he would fix me up for my time.<br/>
After a further hour I told him I needed exp and would move on, at that<br/>
point he said he had some stuff for me and initiated a trade. I asked my<br/>
friend via tell if I should accept and he said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz<br/>
gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I<br/>
asked my friend if they were good (I could see via AC and Stats they were,<br/>
but how good?) he said they were, too good for my level. I have banked them<br/>
for now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear them/sell them or give<br/>
them away. I have no problem with twinking but dont want to be called a<br/>
cheat. So please no flames just an opinion on what I should!<br/>
				 do.<br/>
<br/>
				Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
