<div id="ygrps-yiv-807146388">But then if we add some more &quot;not so mystical powers&quot; into the mix, like<br/>
decent armour, dual wield, &quot;mystic powers&quot; more often than not affecting our<br/>
entire party, I think it pretty much balances out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t fix it if it&#39;s broken though. Maybe through<br/>
the trade window as someone suggested (although I can see how that could<br/>
break the no drop/no trade code)<br/>
or how about this:<br/>
<br/>
It would affect the whole party in such a way that as long as the song was<br/>
going and party members click to get info on their items, they get the<br/>
additional info that the song provides.<br/>
Something like this was also posted on the list, and I don&#39;t know if this is<br/>
what was meant (with me just being a bit slow on the uptake) or whether you<br/>
had other ideas on how it ought to affect the entire party.<br/>

14th song ^_^<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you wish to nitpick, then you are correct. We&#39;re<br/>
not casters. But we have the equivilant of spells<br/>
in our songs. We get *one* &#39;mystical power&#39; per level<br/>
whereas other characters get *multiple* &#39;mystical<br/>
powers&#39; per level. These &#39;mystical powers&#39; are the<br/>
backbone of our class just as they are the backbone<br/>
of the other classes. <br/>
<br/>
Does that fit your requirements a bit better? The<br/>
comparison isn&#39;t silly at all. We only get one<br/>
song per level. It would be nice to have that only<br/>
song be worthwhile. The poster I replied to was<br/>
comparing a caster having a useless &#39;power&#39; to our<br/>
having a useless &#39;power&#39;. I was pointing out that<br/>
when we have a single useless &#39;power&#39; it&#39;s not the<br/>
same as a caster since they get more of these to<br/>
choose from than we do.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing silly in that.</div>
