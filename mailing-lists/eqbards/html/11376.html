&gt; I also just hit 20 and decided to give Lake Rathe a try. Mind you I have<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; actually hunted anything yet, but from a brief swim around the lake it<br/>
&gt; seemed as though there would be plenty to hunt and hopefully I will find<br/>
&gt; some pickup groups.<br/>

Lake Rathe is a nice area - the Aviaks give good experience - especially if<br/>
you get in a group where you can use the AE instrument attack. Eventually,<br/>
as others have said, you should be able to solo the areas.<br/>
<br/>
East Karana is also nice - undead reavers and gnoll reavers - although<br/>
you&#39;ll find that some of the gnoll reavers are green but even some of these<br/>
give a little exp. If you solo the reavers, try not to pull more than one at<br/>
a time - will make for faster down time. Same thing for Gorge Hounds, which<br/>
are also in this zone and give pretty good experience. Just watch out for<br/>
the occasional evil eye and also the cyclops (Broon, Choon, Froon - don&#39;t<br/>
remember which one is the starter spawn there)...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also hunted with groups in South Karana - Either at Aviak City or just<br/>
randomly around the zone hunting Centaurs. If you hunt Centaurs be careful!!<br/>
They are very social creatures - and there are some that will kill you VERY<br/>
quickly - so have your drum handy in case you need to run (which will<br/>
probably happen now and then). At Aviak City - if you are able to get in the<br/>
group in the Penthouse, be careful what you play there, as the axis bug will<br/>
allow ground level creatures to hit you - just don&#39;t play AE songs there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just now started venturing into places like Unrest - but the safest way<br/>
to hunt in places like that is to go with someone who knows the zone AND in<br/>
a group. Thats my 2c from my exp thus far in the game.<br/>
