<br/>
Im in desperate need of some info here. I myself has a natural curiosity<br/>
about new things. So my Bard character has an even greater on new and<br/>
interesting items. With that in mind, I would appreciate any info on how to<br/>
obtain the followin items. Electrum Bladed Wakazashi (Very disappointed<br/>
that the Lute quest doesn&#39;t work, even tho I&#39;m not nearly high nuff to try<br/>
for it yet) Short Sword of the Ykesha (which mob and where drops this item?<br/>
I heard its in Upper Guk?) Mithril Armor (Where and how I find any of these<br/>
pieces) Adamantite Armor(Double for this info I like to know if its better<br/>
than Mithril).<br/>
<br/>
Ps. I think I&#39;m gonna just roll on stocks and Not get a Last name to be<br/>
unique =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks To all in Advance,<br/>
Chancez Bard of the 22nd Chord on BristleBane. <br/>
