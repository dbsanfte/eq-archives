The Bard<br/>
( by Kitasi & Heisler w/ props to Kenny)<br/>
<br/>
On a rainy Norrath evenin&#39;, near a train bound for the zone<br/>
I met up with a bard there, we were both too tired to sleep<br/>
So we took turns a slayin&#39; what spawned in the darkness<br/>
Till boredom overtook us, and he began to speak<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Son, I&#39;ve made a life out of watchin&#39; peoples battles<br/>
And knowin&#39; what their skills are by the way they hold their camps.<br/>
So if you don&#39;t mind me sayin&#39;, I can see you&#39;re out of hit points;<br/>
For a taste of your Ginesh, I&#39;ll give you some advice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I handed him 5 bottles, he drank &#39;em in five swallows<br/>
Then he swayed from side to side and asked me for some light<br/>
And the cave got deathly silent, as his voice lost comprehension<br/>
Said, &quot;If yur&#39;re gorna ptay jhe bard, boy, ya gotsa lergn to pley it rieht.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You got to know when to lull &#39;em, know when to pull &#39;em.<br/>
Know when to stand and fight and know when to run.<br/>
You never loot the corpses when your group&#39;s still busy fightin&#39;.<br/>
Ther&#39;ll be time enough for lootin&#39;, when the killin&#39;s done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now ev&#39;ry bard knows that the secret to survivin&#39;<br/>
Is knowin&#39; how songs are weaved and knowin&#39; which are right<br/>
 &#39;Cause ev&#39;ry song&#39;s a winner, and ev&#39;ry song&#39;s a loser.<br/>
And the best that you can hope for is to die but once a night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And when he finished speakin&#39; he turned back t&#39;wards the spawn spot.<br/>
Brought out his mandolin and played the mob to sleep.<br/>
And somewhere in the darkness, the bard he broke even.<br/>
But in his final tune I found a note that I could keep<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You got to know when to lull &#39;em, know when to pull &#39;em.<br/>
Know when to stand and fight and know when to run.<br/>
You never loot the corpses when your group&#39;s still busy fightin&#39;.<br/>
Ther&#39;ll be time enough for lootin&#39;, when the killin&#39;s done.&quot;<br/>
