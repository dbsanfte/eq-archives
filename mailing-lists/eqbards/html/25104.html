&gt;I think you&#39;d be selling yourself short with the Tamborine.<br/>
&gt;Depending how &quot;near-uber&quot; they are, they may have all sorts of Dragon<br/>
&gt;loot laying around unused... I think even a Selo&#39;s Drum would be too<br/>
&gt;little in exchange for this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It comes off King Tormax (I believe - you said you got it off an<br/>
&gt;Akanon Quest?) and EQPrices lists it for 25k (low, imo).  I&#39;d ask for<br/>
&gt;a Breath of Harmony or a Lute of the Howler.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know - it&#39;s freaky, don&#39;t know how it happened, but I also don&#39;t want to <br/>
take advantage of the guild, seeing as I want to join when I reach 30th <br/>
(minimum requirement for me to join).<br/>
<br/>
Is the Lute of the Howler tradeable?  I thought it was nodrop...<br/>
hrm - I see that it is not.<br/>
<br/>
How about this - request the Lute of the Howler (what&#39;s the worst he can <br/>
say? No?), and the ancient coins from Kaesora, Dalnir and City of <br/>
Mist?  I&#39;ve already got a bloodgill coin, and I see that the others are not <br/>
too hard.  That would get me two out of four really good instruments, not <br/>
bad for a young bard...<br/>
