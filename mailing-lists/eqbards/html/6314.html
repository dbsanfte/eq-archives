&gt; That&#39;s odd.  I got it last night, and it semed to stack with Binding.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have any hard numbers, but I was fighting 2 of the bandits (Brennon<br/>
&gt; and Truk) in the cave just across from Highpass Keep, and used both during<br/>
&gt; the fight.  At first I used it on Truk, and noticed that Brennon swung more<br/>
&gt; often, then I switched to fighting Brennon and noticed that Truk was now<br/>
&gt; swinging at me more.  (Neither were equipped with weapons :o/  )  I&#39;ll try<br/>
&gt; it again tonight just to make sure that my eyes weren&#39;t deceiving me<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do these guys /con to you?  One of the reasons I test this<br/>
on low greens is because mobs closer to your level have a<br/>
greater chance of breaking out of the effect (you will become<br/>
intimately familiar with this when they break out of Chain at<br/>
the worst possible time).  So it&#39;s possible (likely even<br/>
depending on /con) that when you switched to Chain, the one<br/>
you weren&#39;t Chaining broke out of Binding and was attacking at<br/>
normal speed, while the one you were Chaining was still slowed<br/>
down.<br/>
