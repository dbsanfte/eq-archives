 </span></blockquote>  Regarding the spawn time cycle.  It&#39;s as close to a fixed time as<br/>
  possible, but you all stating that it&#39;s 34 mins misleads a lot of<br/>
  people.  It&#39;s not 34 mins, it&#39;s whenever each object in the zone<br/>
  has it&#39;s reset() called.  Verant uses an LPmud code variation for<br/>
  their object control, and as I have invested several years into<br/>
  development of the source of this mud, I can attest to the un-<br/>
  predictability of timing resets.  It all depends on how much is<br/>
  going on in the zone, and what the load on the server supplying <br/>
  the zone is.  I&#39;ve seen 30 min spawns in Guk, I&#39;ve also seen 55<br/>
  min spawns in Guk.  It depends on how many players are there, how<br/>
  many objects are in the zone, and how many NPCs need resetting<br/>
  each cycle.  I&#39;m sure other factors are involved.  This applies<br/>
  to every zone as well.  It looks like Verant sets a time for each<br/>
  object to reset, but according to how much needs to be done - your<br/>
  camped NPC may be the last thing to get reset, hence giving you<br/>
  the impression of a variable (or longer) spawn time.  IIRC, Guk<br/>
  is just like most other zones with a 25/30 min reset.  Due to the<br/>
  activity of the zone, you could see noticable delay in spawn resets.<br/>
 <br/>
  Anyway, just adding my knowledge =)<br/>
