<div id="ygrps-yiv-572577821">Oh, I almost forgot, I tested fufil&#39;s curtailing chant last night to see how<br/>
good the improvements were on it and the dang thing was still resisted 60%<br/>
of the time when used against blue MOBs so apparently the resists were not<br/>
changed on this song.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do any hard number crunching test with it, but it did not appear to<br/>
be significantly improved as far as damage goes when sung so I switched to<br/>
the drum (normal hand drum, I am not yet among the lucky battle bangers) and<br/>
tried it and the damage seemed significant, appeared to do around 50 damage<br/>
total over the duration of the DoT (I targeted myself and was having much<br/>
lag and PL last night so the results cant be considered very accurate but<br/>
only approximate).  I&#39;m guessing this is similar to the difference between<br/>
singing DD and playing it with a brass horn, night and day as someone<br/>
recently noted.  <br/>
<br/>
I am used to being a battle bard so it is hard to get used to dropping my<br/>
weapons and holding an instrument during combat and I often get tells from<br/>
group members who think I forgot to re-equip my weapons and say &quot;Faras, your<br/>
fighting with your drum again!&quot;.  Heh.<br/>
<br/>
I sort of whish there was some visual indication that the song pulsed like<br/>
in other direct damage songs such as bellow, with fufils you have to pay<br/>
close attention to that eye-straining dark blue on dark gray text as it<br/>
flies by amongst the other rapid-fire spams during a fight.  Makes using it<br/>
difficult.<br/>
