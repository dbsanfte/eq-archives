<div id="ygrps-yiv-908279820">Great to hear, Slyde! I&#39;ve helped with Maestro twice and he had nothing for<br/>
the bards both times, the cheapskate. Good to hear he makes up for it on<br/>
occasion. I have boots and BP from my first trip to Hate. I was recently<br/>
congratulated on being &#39;colorful&#39; by a friend: Hate boots and BP,<br/>
lambent/Hero bracer, hammerhead helm, Ry Gor legs, lambent gloves, azure<br/>
sleeves.<br/>
I heard Darkfox in HS last night. We were in South tower.<br/>
<br/>
Song of twilight is one of my current favorites. We were in a room last<br/>
night that had a sloping floor and things would get pushed down the ramp<br/>
during melee that broke the casters&#39; line of sight casts. Getting the mage<br/>
pet to disengage takes too long, so I&#39;d use SoT to drag them back up, or<br/>
drag them out of doorways. It&#39;s really handy to be able to move a mob<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
