<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071270729">Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group. I&#39;m a level 10 bard on Tarew Marr. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a group&quot; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in the area. Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone experienced this?<br/>
