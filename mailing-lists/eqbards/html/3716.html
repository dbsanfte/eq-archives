<div id="ygrps-yiv-854673865">Even though my guild does not have a large amount of bards... 4 or 5 i<br/>
think, the one thing I enjoy the most is the maturity all of our members<br/>
have.  Most of them are 18-40s resulting in players with more mental<br/>
abilities than all of the kewldewds combined... which still isnt saying much<br/>
now that I think about it.  point is, playing with older players is much<br/>
more enjoyable from an intellectual point of view.<br/>

&gt; Only 26 here, but one thing I have noticed is that<br/>
&gt; bards genrally are more mature players and better<br/>
&gt; role-players than most other classes.  Granted this is<br/>
&gt; a genralization, but we are not the power gamer type<br/>
&gt; character, we are the group type, the glue type.  I<br/>
&gt; like that.  One reason I don&#39;t want other races to<br/>
&gt; have bards is because I also like being rare.  In my<br/>
&gt; guild of 40, I&#39;m one of two.  I like that :)<br/>
