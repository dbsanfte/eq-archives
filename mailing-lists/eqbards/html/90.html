I appreciate your concern, and I know that ten platinum is a hefty sum.<br/>
But, as I responded to you privately, the funds are not misused nor are<br/>
they squandered. Running a guild has its expenses, especially if we are to<br/>
provide collective services for our bards so that they might carry on their<br/>
work with honor and dignity.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the following services to our<br/>
members:<br/>
    * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>
    * The first five levels of songs for all new students<br/>
    * A hand drum at level 5<br/>
    * A lute at level 8<br/>
    * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad or writing. This week<br/>
       it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>
    <br/>
Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses, including:<br/>
     * Staff for concerts<br/>
     * Saving for a guild hall<br/>
     * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>
<br/>
We do not use guild money for:<br/>
     * Buying better armor or equipment for guild leadership<br/>
     * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>
     * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who speaks negatively<br/>
       about The Soerbaird<br/>
<br/>
For the public record, all of our staff, called Ollave, have more than paid<br/>
their ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of them continue to<br/>
contribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis, in order to benefit<br/>
our students. I have seen several of them give the shirts off of their<br/>
backs and the weapons from their fists to help a deserved student in need.<br/>
<br/>
Doerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation again in a public forum,<br/>
I would respectfully request that you air your differences with me, as I<br/>
will be happy to hear any problem you have with our guild.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live.<br/>
