&gt;more Soulfires and EBWs and Nightshade Wreaths floating<br/>
&gt;around.  People are &#39;afraid&#39; of the castle and for good<br/>
&gt;reason.  It&#39;s not the picnic people make it out to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Over the last week, 12 nightshade wreaths, 6 EBW, and soulfire hilts for<br/>
both Pals of the guild. 3 bards of the guild all have the battle drums and<br/>
the lute, and a whole schwack of diamondine earrings. Fun place when you<br/>
know waht you are doing as I find that is the major killer to parties in<br/>
that place. Go with someone who has spent a lot of time there and it all<br/>
changes.<br/>
As to wolf form, your faction will make you kos even in wolf form over time.<br/>
That and the dorky teeth you can see while attacking are irritating =)<br/>
