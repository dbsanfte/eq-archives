<div id="ygrps-yiv-475286717">Heh heh, excellent point.  Another aspect of the Haste change.  While groups<br/>
may have used the bard haste speedups when all the melee people had haste<br/>
items, now they will all want better haste buffs from an enchanter.  Once<br/>
again bards will be pushed out so that enchanters will be needed in groups.<br/>

Also, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>
imbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>
&gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>
&gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>
&gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>
&gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>
&gt; value decreased.  <br/>
