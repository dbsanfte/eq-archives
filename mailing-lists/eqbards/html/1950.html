It dawned on me the other day how it really works.  The message you get is<br/>
something like &quot;You feel yourself wrapped in enchantment.&quot;  So what it is<br/>
really doing in effect is making you more acceptible to a particular<br/>
faction.  The target you choose represents that faction so the enchantment<br/>
on you can have the proper effect.  That explains why it works on all<br/>
members of the faction at once rather than just the one where you sing.  In<br/>
other words, there&#39;s no mystical, long-distance effect on everyone in a<br/>
faction.  You yourself are wrapped in a faction-specific enchantment.<br/>
