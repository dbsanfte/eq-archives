<div id="ygrps-yiv-508448529">People don&#39;t sell the Dragoon Dirk for nearly as cheap now, (I found out for<br/>
myself) because now Dvinn does not always have the Dagger on him.  You have<br/>
to kill him 3 or more times to get one these days. I managed to get one for<br/>
30plat.<br/>

&gt; Hang out just outside Crushbone, they usually will loot<br/>

While the dirk by all means should be your first magic weapon,<br/>
the combines are still a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you are around L10 and have managed to save enough for a<br/>
combine and can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to make the trek to Crushbone for<br/>
a dirk, by all means buy one.  You should be able to sell it<br/>
later to a player for a profit, or to a merchant at a 10%-15%<br/>
loss, so they do not really cost as much as their price<br/>
indicates.  While the dirk has dropped the bottom out of the<br/>
combine rapier market, the combine longsword and scimitar<br/>
markets are still doing well because several classes that can<br/>
use those but cannot use the dirk.<br/>
<br/>
If you are L17 or higher and already have a dirk, a combine<br/>
for your off hand can be a good choice for the same reason.<br/>
If you ever upgrade your off-hand weapon, you can easily<br/>
liquidate the combine and get 80%-90% of your money back (more<br/>
if you sell it to a player).  Unless you need the money *now*<br/>
for something else, most combines only end up costing 5-10pp<br/>
to own.<br/>
