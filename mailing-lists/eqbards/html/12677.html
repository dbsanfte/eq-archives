<div id="ygrps-yiv-390925131"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I found the last statement to be very contradicting.  Hasn&#39;t the bard<br/>
&gt; community, on numerous occasions to no avail, sent Verant extensive test<br/>
&gt; results proving that some of our songs weren&#39;t working properly?  Wonder why<br/>
&gt; they are now asking players to send them test results when they seem to have<br/>
&gt; ignored ours for the most part?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I just need an email address or a contact, and I&#39;m willing to give<br/>
  up a few hours a week to test changes on the Test Server with a bard<br/>
  comparable to the bard I currently play.  I don&#39;t know why they <br/>
  wouldn&#39;t take me up on it, it makes too much sense.  I&#39;ve got a lot<br/>
  of research background, and have very analytical approach to things.<br/>
  I do question everything and anything for it&#39;s validity.  <br/>
<br/>
  No one before 1903 thought that humans would be flying, the idea<br/>
  was well accepted by the world as ridiculous, yet those people<br/>
  who questioned the idea made it happen.  Even before all that<br/>
  a person would be marked a loon if they didn&#39;t believe the Sun <br/>
  revolved around the Earth.  Such is the nature of this bard =)<br/>
