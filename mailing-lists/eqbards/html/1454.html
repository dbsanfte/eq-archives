<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080412243">It is a targeted Lullaby song.  It is very useful when your group is <br/>
fighting 2 yellow mobs, it let you sleep one while your group is <br/>
concentrating on the other.  I think they also change the song name from <br/>
Pixie Chase to Pixie.. something else.<br/>
<br/>
And to the other person who was asking about the level 3 song. It is NOT a <br/>
mana regen song, it regen STA not mana.  To get the mana regen song, you <br/>
will have to wait until level 32.  The message will say your mind is clear.. <br/>
when you play that song.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know what Crisson&#39;s Pixie Chase does?  It is the lvl 28 song <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I heard it was tweaked on the patch before the last one, still don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;what it does though.<br/>
