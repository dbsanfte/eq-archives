<b>Subject:</b> The new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299601074">Decided to give this song a whirl last night.  Went to the yeti caves in<br/>
Dreadlands and Lament pulled a single yeti (blue con) outside.  Weaved<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s, Chains and Fear.  For the first time in a long time, I solo<br/>
tanked a mob to death.  The haste with Jonthan&#39;s is tremendous.  I would<br/>
estimate it is close to enchanter&#39;s SLW.  The only time I ever got hit was<br/>
when fear broke early.  Most fights I would only lose one bub of health, two<br/>
if I was really unlucky.  Tried the same tactic with a stonegazer cockatrice<br/>
with similar results.  <br/>
<br/>
So the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it will help us solo<br/>
blue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune shield, soloing would<br/>
be even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>
<br/>
One drawback that I did notice was it didn&#39;t stack with Berserker (and I<br/>
assume our other combat enhancing songs) for other party members.  Since<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is self only, other songs like Berserker should still<br/>
affect everyone in the group beside the bard.  This is not the case.  I<br/>
tested it by starting Jonthan&#39;s, then starting Berserker.  I asked the<br/>
others in my party if they were getting the message &quot;You go berserk&quot; as well<br/>
as an icon on the screen.  As long as I had Jonthan&#39;s in effect on myself,<br/>
no one else in the party got the benefit of Berserker.  This sounds like a<br/>
bug to me.<br/>
