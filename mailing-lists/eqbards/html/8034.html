<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487454562">As far as I know, Pixie Strike does not clear the &quot;sh*t list&quot; in any manner.<br/>
If I pixie strike a large rat, as soon as it&#39;s un-stunned/un-mezzed, it will<br/>
bee-line for me.  If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>
<br/>
My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the Veil<br/>
that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could never<br/>
reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>
would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>
wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be mostly<br/>
useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also, I&#39;ve<br/>
found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike them<br/>
(even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>
consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>
against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>
playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>
screech, etc.<br/>

&gt; Pixie Chase does nothing more than stun a creature.  It doesn&#39;t mesmerize,<br/>

as<br/>
<br/>
The mesmerize line of spells has a memory blur component that<br/>
has been weakened lately, and according to my high level<br/>
enchanter friends doesn&#39;t work on high level mobs.  A stun<br/>
cannot be broken by an attack.  A mesmerize can.  So Pixie<br/>
Strike is indeed a mesmerize.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can tell.  I once tried to Pixie + Hymn my way back to full health, but<br/>
&gt; the duration of it seems to be all over the board (as long as 10<br/>
seconds...<br/>
&gt; as short as 1 second..)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your charisma?  At 120 charisma against medium blues or<br/>
lower, I&#39;d say it lasts full duration about 80% of the time -<br/>
high enough that I generally weave two other songs with it.  <br/>
Against high blues it&#39;s not as effective and tends to last a<br/>
shorter time - I either just Strike over and over, or mix in<br/>
one other song.  The resists don&#39;t help either.<br/>
<br/>
Note that while Strike+Hymn is the only way to make this<br/>
viable while soloing, just Striking over and over can be<br/>
valuable in a group when everyone is OOM, low on health, and<br/>
there&#39;s one mob left to kill.  You can pause it long enough<br/>
for everyone to get enough mana and hp to kill it comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
I always have this song memorized, even when grouped with an<br/>
enchanter (they can go linkdead, or get a mob attacking them<br/>
to where they can&#39;t mes anything much less the three other<br/>
mobs the rest of you are fighting).  This song gives you<br/>
something no other song does - time.<br/>
