<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715266047">I died in the lava - fell off the ramp running to zone on first visit to<br/>
that place.  My wiz fiend levi&#39;d over and dragged it out - I was rezzed and<br/>
looted it at the zone - but boy was I nervous while sitting in Rivervale<br/>
waiting for them to get it. She musta blindly clicked until she got it<br/>
targeted.  I consented and she dragged.  She might have pulled it to a place<br/>
where Z-axis effect can pull it up to the top, zoned out,  then /corpsed it<br/>
up to the top. (We /corpsed one from the bottom of HH canyon straight up to<br/>
the top ledge one time.) <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand... a high level warrior in our guild (hehe she seemed high<br/>
to me at the time 39ish) died in lava and was told no help from GM&#39;s.  She<br/>
was so bummed she declared her char to be dead - and the guild held a<br/>
funeral for her. (She had full crafted and some nice stuff.)  Well,<br/>
apparently the fastest way to resurrect a dead 39 is to start and play a<br/>
cleric to teens and that frustration seemed to be enough to raise the dead!<br/>
Our warrior princess came back to life and the guild helped her get her<br/>
armor back and replace items so she had same or as good or better stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I zoned into Sol-A one day after a bad time with that stoopid croc the<br/>
wizzies need for quest stuff.  Some poor solu had just died in the lava.  I<br/>
offered to loc it and to levi him - we did this pre-bug on levi.  He managed<br/>
to target, drag, fall in, swim, drag out, loot and get all his stuffs back.<br/>
Woo hoo!  I was sure scared that I would try to get closer to the lava and<br/>
fall in.<br/>
<br/>

p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into Sol-b?<br/>
Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in Lava<br/>
if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone out of sol-b<br/>
in panic and die in the lava?<br/>

		My conclusion is that it is realistically only possible to<br/>
get a corpse out of this <br/>
		lava (unless it is remarkably well-placed) if you have<br/>
levitate, which is a pretty high <br/>
		level spell for this level dungeon.  And even then, you<br/>
probably also want group gate. <br/>
		 (Note that, with our current song, this would not be<br/>
possible; once you fell after the <br/>
		third pulse, you would be in the lava, and the song will NOT<br/>
raise you out.)  I&#39;m not <br/>
		sure what sadist designed this dungeon.  ;)<br/>
