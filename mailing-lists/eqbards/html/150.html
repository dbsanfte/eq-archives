As to the poster below, his explanation of raining on everyone in the<br/>
area is a good one.  Guards etc. ARE killable at high levels, and they<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate you attacking them.  What he says after that is a)<br/>
confusing, since that isn&#39;t what you were doing and b) rude and uncalled<br/>
for.  I&#39;d ignore that part.<br/>

&gt; Chords of Dissonance is an area spell.  And that&#39;s exactly what it<br/>
&gt; does.  It effects an area.  Just like when it rains, it rains on<br/>
&gt; everyone in the area, not just the bad people.  So proceed with caution<br/>
&gt; when using area spells.  Don&#39;t just get greedy and try to kill a<br/>
&gt; million things to get a ton of experience.  Dork. </span></blockquote></div>
