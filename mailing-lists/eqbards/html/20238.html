<div id="ygrps-yiv-311027427">Yes.  I&#39;ve had some trouble getting people to understand I can&#39;t just chat<br/>
away on the keyboard while we are fighting.  Most people just have no<br/>
concept that&#39;s bards fingers seldom leave the keyboard or stop moving for<br/>
more than a second while fighting.<br/>

I probably end up leading about 1/4 of the time, more when I&#39;m in pickup<br/>
groups, <br/>
less in guild events.  I really would prefer not to have to; leadership<br/>
requires <br/>
a fair amount of direction-giving during fights, and that interferes with <br/>
song-weaving.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as much of a problem when my warrior<br/>
leads, for <br/>
example.<br/>
