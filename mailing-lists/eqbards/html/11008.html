<div id="ygrps-yiv-959062264">Why though you just say how you feel no reasons. The 50&#39;s have done<br/>
everything they can and then some. I&#39;ve been to PoF and PoH but they are<br/>
both a waste now. The most fun thing to do for a 50 is to twink a char and<br/>
play that char for awhile. I still don&#39;t have a problem with twinking and I<br/>
never  will.<br/>

&gt;Because your chars don&#39;t know each other from a hole in the ground. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think twinking should be acceptable just because level 50 people<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you adventure and get an item you can&#39;t use.. give it to someone else.<br/>
&gt;Trade it for something of an appropriate level that you CAN use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Yes this will not happen because Verant does not have a problem with<br/>
&gt;&gt; twinking. If you adventure and get a item you can&#39;t use why shouldn&#39;t you<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;&gt; able to make a new char and use it? That&#39;s what Verant said&#39;s and I<br/>
