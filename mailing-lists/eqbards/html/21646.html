<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108189669">-	my initial charm wears off to soon for my pet to make it to the<br/>
target to attack, so I have to redo the entire charm, get close to pet, tell<br/>
it to attack etc.<br/>
<br/>
Get ahead of your charm&#39;s target.  Turn around and reapply the charm, that<br/>
way regardless of whether it&#39;s charmed or not, your thrall is always running<br/>
towards you.  Just make sure you&#39;ve got Selo&#39;s going in the background so<br/>
you can back off.  After a couple of hits, and once the charm wears off,<br/>
both mobs will come after you, usually side by side so that when you reapply<br/>
the charm, your pet will go back to beating on the other without having to<br/>
chase it.<br/>
<br/>
-	both critters run at me, the pet is behind the target and the target<br/>
keeps running at me instead of turning to fight my pet<br/>
<br/>
Switch targets and charm the closest.  While the two are beating on each<br/>
other, maneouver yourself into a better position to choose which mob you<br/>
favour.<br/>
<br/>
-	targeting in general.  F8 targets the closest hostile, but what if<br/>
both are uncharmed?<br/>
<br/>
I generally charm the mob with the greatest health and the greatest chance<br/>
to survive the fight.  You could try using one of the F9 views to more<br/>
easily pick your targets, as I often find that more accurate than in first<br/>
person view.<br/>
