<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348704117">Somehow I lost one of my rings ┬û I forget the name it was a +7 Cha/+5 Dex<br/>
(the other that I have is +5 Cha/ +7 Dex).  I┬Æm not sure if it was due to a<br/>
bug ┬û or I left it on corpse the last time I looted it ┬û but regardless don┬Æ<br/>
t see the point of trying to petition for a 200p item (that I doubt will get<br/>
resolved positively anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Just curious what you all recommend for a 52 Bard.<br/>
<br/>
A buddy of mine is selling a pair of SS Vambraces ┬û couldn┬Æt hook up last<br/>
night ┬û but will tonight!<br/>
<br/>
PS Gaelethorne ┬û if I was a betting man ┬û I┬Æd bet on you beating me to 53 ┬û<br/>
I don┬Æt put a priority on leveling and have been doing a lot stuff like<br/>
raids, grouping with lower level friends and guildies fighting ┬û<br/>
green-to-me ┬û and need to get a HS key one of these days┬à  Good luck!<br/>
