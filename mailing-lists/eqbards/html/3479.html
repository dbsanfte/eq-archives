&gt;&gt; restoration does not stack normally, you will get the not taking hold<br/>
&gt;&gt; message. Chorus of clarity however does stack with another bard. We have<br/>
&gt;&gt; had 2 bards and an enchanter casting clarity and the wizards where going<br/>
&gt;&gt; bananas. Lots of fun. I say normally cause last night me and another bard<br/>
&gt;&gt; accidently started the healing song at the same time and it stacked. We<br/>
&gt;&gt; didnt get the hold message and we where healing almost 40pts per tick! We<br/>

&gt;Probably a lag-incuded glitch.  I noticed last night while<br/>
&gt;weaving/juggling/mixing/cycling :-) Accelerando with the<br/>
&gt;ultravision song that if you start a song so that its effect<br/>
&gt;kicks in the same instant it&#39;s previous pulse ends, the<br/>
&gt;ending effect takes precedence.  i.e. I&#39;d hit Accel, then the<br/>
&gt;other song, then Accel again.  I got the pulse, the &quot;feet move<br/>
&gt;faster&quot; message followed immediately by the &quot;slow down&quot;<br/>
&gt;message, and I was moving at normal running speed despite that<br/>
&gt;I was still singing Accel.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Im inclined to say no on this... we did this multiple times all night.<br/>
Health was rocketing up, it wasnt a subtle effect. However, we cant repeat<br/>
it now so maybe that night was just a dream :P<br/>
I know the effect you are talking about too, get it all the time, sometimes<br/>
the bards accelerando will actually cancel mine out, though it doesnt<br/>
happen enough to be anythuing other than annoying.</div>
