<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255725782">Last night I made my first Hate raid, and it was a doozy!<br/>
<br/>
I had attempted to sign up late with the normal raid leader (Theryon) and <br/>
was told that he&#39;d have to see.  Then RL issues kept him from attending.  <br/>
The backup raid leader (Kittie) and the monk puller were also no-shows, so <br/>
many people began to think that the raid wouldn&#39;t happen, but someone else <br/>
took over and led it.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up with a group of guildmates; 3 shaman (shamen?  shamans?  <br/>
shapersons?), a warrior, a cleric, and myself.  Only one other bard <br/>
(Fantacy, who was really nice... hehe) was in attendance.  We agreed that if <br/>
any bard items drop and she doesn&#39;t have it (she only needed BP, legs, <br/>
boots, and gloves I think) she would get it, otherwise it&#39;s mine.  However, <br/>
she warned, the past 5 Hate raids she went on, no bard items dropped.  I <br/>
told her maybe I&#39;ll have beginner&#39;s luck.  Boy did I ever...  =8^)<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, my group managed to get exp (even though I died 4-5 times, I still <br/>
ended up with more exp then when I started).  As a matter of fact, I dinged <br/>
47 on the very last (or maybe next to last) mob pulled for the night!<br/>
<br/>
Drops were incredible.  Everyone in my group got at least one item, some got <br/>
more.  Every class had at least one item drop (I think).  The shammies were <br/>
thrilled with an incredible 5-6 drops.  Clerics went nuts, with some <br/>
actually getting 2 pieces, which from my understanding, is unheard of.  A <br/>
couple mage items dropped, and a couple rogue items dropped.  Warriors were <br/>
dissapointed as no warrior items dropped until the end (I&#39;ll get to that).  <br/>
I made out like a bandit...  hehe  I got arms, helm, and Evensong!  Fantacy <br/>
got gloves.  Warriors finally were tossed a bone at the end when the Maestro <br/>
dropped the warrior epic quest item (some hand thing).  The warrior in my <br/>
group, Esop, won that.<br/>
<br/>
Everything went really well with only one snag; when moving from the wall <br/>
camp to D (which is Maestro&#39;s building) we somehow pulled a nasty train and <br/>
almost everyone was killed.  Some clerics were able to camp out however, so <br/>
we were back up and pulling in no time.<br/>
<br/>
I love Hate!  =8^)<br/>
