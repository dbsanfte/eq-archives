<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032319019">I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on Camelot.  I was intrigued that they were<br/>
originally using the Rolemaster system, bards in it are pretty cool.  Have<br/>
to see how much they have to change with the demise of ICE.  I&#39;ll probably<br/>
jump to whichever MMORPG that comes out next that has bards at least as a<br/>
trial.<br/>

Hi, Kit!  That&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve quit twice myself and cancelled the account<br/>
both times.  Anyway, the mmorpg I&#39;ve got my eye on right now is Dark Age of<br/>
Camelot.  I&#39;ve always loved the Camelot myths and they have bardic classes.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen anything about it yet, check it out at<br/>

 <br/>
And as for why I started a bard, it was because I remember seeing one in<br/>
GFay when I first started playing.  She was playing HoR, and I thought it<br/>
was very cool that the sparkles kept going and going and going. ;-)<br/>

heh heh, twice.  Both times I let friends convince me to come back.  I must<br/>
say though if there were any other mmorpg&#39;s out there currently with bards I<br/>
would likely quit and at least try the other game.  Not saying I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
come back, but it wouldn&#39;t be hard at this point to lure me away given the<br/>
immense frustration VI has built up in me over the last year.<br/>

So did you cancel your account? *grin*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still happy with my choice, though.  The day I stop playing my Bard is<br/>
the day I stop playing EQ.<br/>
