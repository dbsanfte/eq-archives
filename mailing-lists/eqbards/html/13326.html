<div id="ygrps-yiv-333139674"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As for the giants, I worked with single mes, spell<br/>
&gt; called Entrance. AND IT WORKED. Mebbe just for a short<br/>
&gt; time, but it worked, cuz I received a note &#39;IG has<br/>
&gt; been entranced&#39;, which is always good to hear.<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The message will still display, but the ice giant will keep on<br/>
  swinging.  You cannot stun, mez, or otherwise hold those things<br/>
  still unless it&#39;s your pet.  They just shrug it off, otherwise.<br/>
  A good example of this for bards is pixie strike, try pixieing<br/>
  a giant, you&#39;ll get the glaze over message and the giant will <br/>
  keep on trucking.<br/>
