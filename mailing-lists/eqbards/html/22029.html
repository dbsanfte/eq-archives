<div id="ygrps-yiv-714195080">The &quot;3&quot; spawn in the Overthere is a small tower where three sarnaks spawn<br/>
with a relatively quick respawn timer.  It is along the path in between the<br/>
FM and WW zones.  The &quot;6&quot; spawn is a ruin that is directly out from the FM<br/>
zone (IIRC).  There is also a &quot;10&quot; spawn somewhere in zone also.<br/>
<br/>
All of these spawns have Sarnak Bezerkers, Knights and Enthusiasts with the<br/>
associated rare gear that comes along with them.<br/>
