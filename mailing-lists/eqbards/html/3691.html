&gt;      What!  gasp!  You mean I&#39;m not the only 30+ year old in the game...<br/>
&gt;      Yea!  There is hope for me after all...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Bujold  17 level soon to be 16th....<br/>
&gt;      (had a bad night, I actually took someone&#39;s advice on this list and<br/>
&gt;      tried weaving Discord into my combat stack and proceed to get<br/>
pounded.<br/>
&gt;      I don&#39;t mean to be rude but those AOE damage spells are only good for<br/>
&gt;      harvesting IMHO)<br/>

&gt; Ah, Michael. Thank you SO MUCH for the nice &quot;lift me up&quot;. I have so much<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; look forward to! (smile).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d rather know AHEAD of time, rather than getting there, saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;What the...&quot; and then annoying GMs about it. &quot;My XP bar is bugged!!!<br/>
&gt; Someone help me!!&quot;. Yeah... sure.... heheheh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At level 30, I saw it first hand. It WAS slower to level, took several<br/>
days<br/>
&gt; rather than the typical couple of days. There were many times I would say<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; my party, &#39;Guys.... it&#39;s moving... backwards.... argh... someone...<br/>
help...<br/>
&gt; me....&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That does bring me to another point: Love how a lot of players, who see<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you are above 30th, call me a &quot;power leveller&quot;.  I kinda squint my eyes<br/>
&gt; because, though I understand what they are trying to imply, I have NO idea<br/>
&gt; HOW to &quot;power level&quot;. I kill things that are blue to red for me. I get XP.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; gain levels. I do all of this while hunting for rare items and hanging out<br/>
&gt; with friends. It&#39;s almost as though they insinuate that I &quot;cheat&quot; to<br/>
level,<br/>
&gt; or have some unfair advantage to levelling. I guess sometimes I DO have an<br/>
&gt; advantage: it&#39;s called a group. A group of friends. I have ALWAYS made<br/>
&gt; better level progress while grouped than I do while solo. Some bards have<br/>
&gt; claimed great success while soloing. Guess I fit into the geriatric list<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; 30+ year olds who play this game who just CAN&#39;T SOLO. I find it difficult,<br/>
&gt; unexciting, and frustrating. Most of these people (though I admit, less<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; a dozen) who accuse me of &quot;power levelling&quot; have been seen running around<br/>
&gt; solo. Well, my friends, drop the attitude, and get a group. Be loyal to<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; group, and level yourself. That, or quit being jealous (smile)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I am bored, so thought I would rant a bit. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I, myself, made 35th level last night, which I have learned<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is the second of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at least three &quot;hell levels&quot; where your experience is somehow<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;watered down&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to slow you down. 30th level was like this, but I am told<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 35th is worse, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 40th is worse still. Don&#39;t know anyone on my server to have<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; reached 45th or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 49th to tell me whether they are the same, as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;49th is the same as any other level, just hard to find stuff that gives<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;exp, since a lot of stuff is green that used to be blue.  45th is<br/>
&gt; definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt;a hell level, and is the worst.  Took me 10 days to get from 45 to 46,<br/>
&gt; &gt;playing every day several hours.  Half-bubble to a bubble for a long game<br/>
&gt; &gt;day is a good thing.  Getting a bubble at 45 is like getting a whole<br/>
normal<br/>
&gt; &gt;level it feels like.  Bet you can&#39;t wait now hehe.<br/>
