<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990605633">I believe that the bards in the back room of the guild hall sell a<br/>
smattering of songs. I know that the 8th level song, Lament, is only<br/>
available in Kelethin as is 11 and 13 I think. A few higher level songs seem<br/>
available at all bard guilds but most of them will be hidden in other remote<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
	Sure, tehre are some lists around on the internet listing the locations of<br/>
most of the songs but I think it is more fun to ask fellow bards in-game<br/>
where they might be.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached<br/>
8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>
My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to<br/>
the<br/>
7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the<br/>
songs.<br/>
Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild<br/>
leader<br/>
in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>
<br/>
I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me<br/>
directly<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>
8th level Bardess<br/>
