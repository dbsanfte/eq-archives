&gt;Well, the Meditate skill is pretty sweet.  Didn&#39;t even have to zone for it<br/>
&gt;to work (read somewhere that we would have to zone for it to kick in the<br/>
&gt;first time).  Also noticed crocs (blue to me at 17) in Lake Rathe, and heard<br/>
&gt;of froglocks there too... generic ones that fight (and get the snot beat out<br/>
&gt;of them by) the resident DW gobbies.  Also noticed this interesting<br/>
&gt;tidbit... you can no longer consume vast amounts of alcohol.  Once you get<br/>
&gt;to your... uhm... &quot;drunkenness limit&quot;, you now get a message saying &quot;You<br/>
&gt;could not possibly consume more alcohol or get any more intoxicated!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;Also, you get skill increases even when drunk now (maybe it was the fact<br/>
&gt;that I was using Elven Wine, but I was able to get my Tolerance skill from 2<br/>
&gt;to 45 with 60 jugs of wine... seems to be speeded up a bit)<br/>
&gt;Anyone else notice any other hidden things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I did -- I no longer &#39;surf&#39; the landscape when running and playing <br/>
Selo&#39;s. They&#39;ve<br/>
added animations so we now run and play a lute/drumstick.<br/>
