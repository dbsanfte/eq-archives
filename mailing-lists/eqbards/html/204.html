&#39;Suffering&#39; is a close ally of &#39;Starvation&#39;. Always ready to come to its<br/>
aid. And finish off any who fall under it warn blade...<br/>

	Different songs will be more powerful when playing the instrument<br/>
prescribed in the songs description. Therefor all have a use, but if you<br/>
only use a few songs, then you only need the given one, unless you are happy<br/>
with the affects of just singing it.<br/>

&gt; I have recently had all my worldly good stripped from me. Actually, they<br/>
&gt; were on my corpse, way up in Everfrost Peaks, but having died in Qeynos<br/>
&gt; Hills, I lost it.<br/>
&gt; Taking this as a sign from the Gods, I decided to practice Hand-to-Hand<br/>
&gt; attacking until I could generate more coin. Decided to truly live the life<br/>
&gt; of an ascetic, I choose to fast. I hoped that I could &quot;live on a song&quot; and<br/>
&gt; have Jaxon&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor restore any stamina a lost due to starvation.<br/>
&gt; This plan might have worked, but I zoned and the song ended and I<br/>
&gt; forget to<br/>
&gt; re-sing it. I cast it as I passed out and watched my stamina and health<br/>
&gt; bars creep up and down near their midpoints. Eventually, I began to bleed<br/>
&gt; to death. I don&#39;t know why, I guess starvation will do that to you. The<br/>
&gt; Coup de Grace (sp?) was right before I died. I received a rather odd<br/>
&gt; message. I left it at home, but the gist was:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>
&gt; Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>
&gt; you died<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whoah! Who are these Pain and Suffering beasties? They apparently live in<br/>
&gt; the city of Qeynos, since that&#39;s where I was at the time.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve since decided that I should probably eat. As of this posting, Plastos<br/>
&gt; is camped out under the Dock of Qeynos, wishing he had more food and some<br/>
&gt; clothing. Tonight, the long climb back begins.<br/>
