<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864709329">swap out the agi stuff. a lowly bronze bracer provides a LOT more protection<br/>
than a serp bracer.  (ie, grab a pair of symbol of loyalty to vox if you<br/>
want to keep steel bracer look, or a pair of lambent bracers)<br/>
<br/>
lambent bp is worlds better than the mithril bp, also looks better with<br/>
lambent arms/legs imho.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d also change the choker to a runed lava pendant or a cape of midnight<br/>
mist. (2 real ac is better than 6 agi and 0 ac) tho o/c you may want to<br/>
watch your procs since dex unfortunately tied to a lot of your agi gear.<br/>

I am a level 43 (almost 44) Bard on Veeshan and I was wondering if anyone<br/>
could suggest what equipment of mine I should get rid of and what I should<br/>
replace it with, this is what I am wearing.....</div>
