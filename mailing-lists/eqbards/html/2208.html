The senario,  a group of 4 20s plus killing broon<br/>
Broon half dead<br/>
a 19 bard and 19 monk attacks to help finish him<br/>
<br/>
the bard and monk got the kill<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the group of 4 were friends, but they were still mad.<br/>
<br/>
When we went back and looked at the fight script.  It turns out<br/>
together we did 42 damage - hehe I was only punching as a Bard.  Then<br/>
did more than 1000 and he was half when we started.<br/>
<br/>
Verant need to look at their code 8)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; After reading much discussion on the perceived look<br/>
&gt; that bard&#39;s should<br/>
&gt; have from a roleplaying stand point I am now<br/>
&gt; inclined to begin wielding a<br/>
&gt; Dragoon Dirk and a Combine Rapier[thanks John =)]. <br/>
&gt; I spent the greater<br/>
&gt; part of yesterday wandering, and hunting in and<br/>
&gt; around Crushbone.  Or more<br/>
&gt; specifically hunting down such fiends as Crush and<br/>
&gt; DVinn.  Suffice my<br/>
&gt; guild spent the day slying both Crush and DVinn and<br/>
&gt; the occaisional spawn<br/>
&gt; of the Warlord.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After spending the day there with my group<br/>
&gt; consisting of a level 19<br/>
&gt; cleric, level 17 cleric, level 21 wiz and 19 ranger,<br/>
&gt; I can honestly say<br/>
&gt; that the jig definitely helps with mana<br/>
&gt; regeneration.  However the one<br/>
&gt; thing we applied yesterday was the wonderful notion<br/>
&gt; of who gets the kill.<br/>
&gt; I honestly believe that there is a major flaw with<br/>
&gt; the way loot/exp<br/>
&gt; is awarded to groups.  While I was camped in the<br/>
&gt; tower it never failed to<br/>
&gt; amaze how the looting rights were assigned.  Many<br/>
&gt; times the party I was in<br/>
&gt; was able to ensure that we got the kill by strictly<br/>
&gt; planning for our wiz<br/>
&gt; to nuke only twice.  It did not matter what anyone<br/>
&gt; else did, only that the<br/>
&gt; wiz nuked twice.  That way he was about to do more<br/>
&gt; damage than anyone<br/>
&gt; person who attacked it.  This point was driven home<br/>
&gt; when we had a level 24<br/>
&gt; druid camping steal killing from my group (after I<br/>
&gt; asked her to share the <br/>
&gt; spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal<br/>
&gt; kill.  Now my group in<br/>
&gt; total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in<br/>
&gt; total(she did about 300<br/>
&gt; damage in total), yet she still got the kill from<br/>
&gt; standing on the window<br/>
&gt; sill.  Does this seem wrong to anyone?  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW the funniest thing that ever happened that day<br/>
&gt; was the moment when I<br/>
&gt; bellowed DVinn out the window.  It was incredibly<br/>
&gt; funny to hear the shout<br/>
&gt; that cam afterwards.  &quot;Some high levels are training<br/>
&gt; DVinn out of the<br/>
&gt; castle&quot;, and all the while we were waiting for him<br/>
&gt; to return.<br/>
