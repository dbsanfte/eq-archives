<div id="ygrps-yiv-388761097">I personally forage to be a brewer since I think bards should help spread<br/>
the good word of the pleasures of fine beverages.  The forage skill we have<br/>
is too low for that kind of foraging.  Our foraging is sufficient to not<br/>
starve, but that&#39;s about it.  I have run naked from Halas to Freeport (don&#39;t<br/>
ask) and even though I was constantly foraging ended the run with 1 extra<br/>
set of berries and thirsty.  I&#39;d also think we should be able to get some of<br/>
the specials at least occassionally.  Most of our caps are really too low to<br/>
be particularly useful, and just high enough to be mildly interesting.<br/>

I would agree with the assessment that forage is not too low.  And if it&#39;s<br/>
low at all, it&#39;s certainly not too low to be useful.  I think it&#39;s perfect<br/>
for what they intended.  They intended it to be not as good as a full<br/>
fledged forager would have.  I forage way more than enough food, and just<br/>
slightly less than enough water to keep me alive.  So I can forage enough<br/>
berrires and fruit and such to give to my brewing friends, and still have<br/>
plenty of food to eat.  I don&#39;t mind that I have to buy water every so<br/>
often, since characters without forage at all have to do it a lot more<br/>
often.  I think those who think it is useless are either too lazy to press<br/>
the button often enough, or have a case of sour grapes (or is that berries?)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far.  Once again a reminder, I&#39;m not looking<br/>
&gt;&gt;to send in an email asking for new features added, just for fixes to<br/>

&gt;This all looks really good (although I&#39;ll stand by my belief in Forage not<br/>
&gt;being too low).  If no one has any oppositional posts by next week, I say<br/>
&gt;send it.<br/>
