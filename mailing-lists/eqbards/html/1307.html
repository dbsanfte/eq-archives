&gt; &gt; Last night I was checking prices on plate mail, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to mem up the charisma song just to see if it made<br/>
&gt; &gt; even a 1cp difference in prices. I used my mino horn and<br/>
&gt; &gt; targeted the indifferent shopkeeper. Low and behold, he<br/>
&gt; &gt; con&#39;d amiable after the song took affect. Not only did he<br/>
&gt; &gt; con amiable, but so did every other shopkeeper in east<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport.The price of the chest plate remained at 794pp<br/>
&gt; &gt; though with my 90 charisma. (I think prices can only go so<br/>
&gt; &gt; low).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yup, I&#39;ve pretty much verified this.  I dropped by the gypsies<br/>
&gt; again and at 110, 115, and 120 charisma, their price for a<br/>
&gt; combine longsword was always 52.5pp.  The selling price was<br/>
&gt; 47.5pp, so that establishes (for gypisies and this item at<br/>
&gt; least) a base price of 50pp and +/- 5% being the best you can<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The shady swashbuckler is still giving me better prices as I<br/>
&gt; increase my charisma though.  223pp at 110, 220pp at 115.  I<br/>
&gt; just got back to Freeport last night and need to test it at<br/>
&gt; 120.  So there&#39;s definitely some faction/race/diety component<br/>
&gt; to all this.  The charisma song may be worthwhile in this<br/>
&gt; regard (especially since half those damn stuck-up Erudite<br/>
&gt; merchants won&#39;t sell to me).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; thru Neriak for a half hour. On the other hand (if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; dont have invis yet), use it on a Dark Elf guard and run<br/>
&gt; &gt; thru Nektulos on your way to Lavastorm without them<br/>
&gt; &gt; attacking you. Thats just an example. I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; many other uses yet to be discovered. Say you die inside<br/>
&gt; &gt; the house of Unrest and you need to get your corpse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps you can target a skel or whatever, use the song on<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and then the entire UnrestInhabitants faction will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; amiable to you for a few minutes? Enough time to /corpse<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps that&#39;s the intended use of the song?  Not getting<br/>
&gt; better prices at merchants as previously thought?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; your corpse to safety and wont have to worry about getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone to cast invis + invis vs undead on you. Just an<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea, but I havent actually tested these things yet. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest you all experiment with this a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a safety question - does the NPC ever attack you if the<br/>
&gt; song somehow fails?  I get nervous targeting songs at NPCs<br/>
&gt; that are red to me.  :-)<br/>
