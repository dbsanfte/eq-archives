&gt;The easiest and most sensible fix is to remove the z-axis code, and fix<br/>
&gt;spell casters so they can&#39;t cast any spells while levitating.  So they can<br/>
&gt;either float away from danger, or get down on the ground and attack, but<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>

You would only be able to engage in melee combat while levitating (no<br/>
balance for archery, too much concentration for spellcasting), other<br/>
spell-effect things (are there wands of fireballs yet?) would have to be<br/>
addressed then.  Simultaneous with that, I would remove the ability to cast<br/>
levitate on anyone not in your group.  If I were king, that is.<br/>
