Unrest and Befallen are unusual and apparently special cases.  Probably due<br/>
to their level range as you mentioned, the undead in those locations have<br/>
been &quot;nerfed&quot; (I&#39;m sure they write flaming alt.games.everquest posts about<br/>
it too) - they can&#39;t see normally invised folks.  If you go to the undead<br/>
side of Lower Guk, Kithicor Forest at night, or use Clouding against<br/>
Spectres, etc. you will find that it is inneffective.  It&#39;s *not* truly<br/>
invis to undead even though the issue is clouded (no pun intended) by bards<br/>
having matured using it in places like Unrest and Befallen.  When I visit<br/>
Unrest or Befallen I still fire up Clouding, but make no mistake - this<br/>
won&#39;t work in Lower Guk or Kithicor.<br/>

&gt; I hate to say this but Invis to undead is pointless.  Sonorious<br/>
&gt; Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to<br/>
&gt; level.  I have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though<br/>
&gt; Unrest mansion with it active.  As soon as I dropped it I was<br/>
&gt; attacked.  I have walked through befallen with the same results.<br/>
&gt; I have no doubt that our clouding is a universal invisability and<br/>
&gt; was intended as one, there for we do not need invis vs undead.  I<br/>
&gt; think the problem is that many of you who have had troubles with<br/>
&gt; this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered out of<br/>
&gt; range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become<br/>
&gt; visiable, or are trying to hide from undead levels much higher<br/>
&gt; then you where it I guess resisted the song.  I personally would<br/>
&gt; like to see a true mem blur song.. except GZ and crew are more<br/>
&gt; worried about enchanters and balancing us to be lesser the ever<br/>
&gt; present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief, then<br/>
&gt; the actual usefulness of bards. </span></blockquote></div>
