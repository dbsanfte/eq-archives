<div id="ygrps-yiv-504339207">While it does seem a bit backwards...<br/>
I think the point is that the cloak contains<br/>
a bit of the &quot;essnece&quot; of nag...so that it is<br/>
a &quot;theme&quot; item...in this case the theme is a<br/>
big badass fire breathing wyrm...<br/>
<br/>
So because nag is fire resistant so is the item<br/>
he drops...mabey you could even say that the<br/>
magical cloak was made from his scales or whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
just my opinion though..:)<br/>
