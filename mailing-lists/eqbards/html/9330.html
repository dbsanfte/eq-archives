<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358178512">I&#39;ve never seen this either - if it happens again - I&#39;d definitely &quot;/bug&quot; it<br/>
to Verant.  They&#39;ve told us that what they describe as a game server is<br/>
really a &quot;farm&quot; of server boxes.  My guess is that they had a problem on one<br/>
of their boxes - or their internal network containing the boxes.  They&#39;ve<br/>
also mentioned they have multiple zones per box - so if it was load based -<br/>
it could have been caused by another zone that shares the same box as<br/>

&gt; (This is a repost.  Several messages I&#39;ve sent after I sent this one have<br/>
&gt; already come back so think this one may have gotten lost in cyberspace)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I was in Mistmoore at 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats 3 AM EST.  When I<br/>
&gt; logged on, there were less than 15 people in the zone.  The entire time I<br/>
&gt; was in Mistmoore, my packet loss percentage never went below 25%.  A<br/>
&gt; guildmate was also in MM and I asked if they were having problems as well.<br/>
&gt; They stated they weren&#39;t having any problems and suggested I quit the game </span></blockquote></div>
