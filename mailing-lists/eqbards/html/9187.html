to be casters who do this, probably because they can kill<br/>
steal), is to just invis yourself/your group and let them have<br/>
everything.  My friends and I rarely camp so we usually don&#39;t<br/>
space out the spawns.  A druid tried to take our spot once so<br/>
I just invised everyone.  Mob spawns, attacks druid, druid<br/>
fights back, 20 seconds later a second mob spawns, druid is<br/>
having trouble getting spells off, 30 seconds later a third<br/>
mob spawns, druid is still fighting the first mob and quickly<br/>
drops below half hp, I ask if she needs help.<br/>

A friend of mine and her group were in the barroom in Unrest,<br/>
with a couple people camping the knight upstairs.  Apparently<br/>
they weren&#39;t interested in anything but the knight as they let<br/>
everything else run down (LOS bug) to her group.  She got fed<br/>
up with it and just invised her group.  Knight spawns, two<br/>
people upstairs drop their invis to attack, entire barroom<br/>
runs upstairs to attack them.<br/>

If you want to get into dirty tricks, our AE songs will blow<br/>
people&#39;s invisibility (people not grouped with you).  I found<br/>
that out accidently when I was running from a train with<br/>
Screech playing.  Dunno if I&#39;d ever use it, perhaps given a<br/>
sufficiently obnoxious kill stealer.<br/>
