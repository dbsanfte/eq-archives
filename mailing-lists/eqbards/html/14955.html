<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767063247">I was in MM last night hunting around the lake.  Clouding worked without a<br/>
hitch for me.  Not only against the mobs around the lake, but the trains<br/>
from inside the castle.  We were around the tower from the entrance.  I<br/>
would con the mobs that came walking back from the zone, granted I didn&#39;t<br/>
con every mob, but all those I did were indifferent.  Sounds like the<br/>
wandering buffer is the more likely explanation or somehow the Camo was<br/>
overriding the Clouding&#39;s protection.<br/>

    Speaking of Clouding - it has been failing big time lately by Mobs that<br/>
are now green to me in Mistmoore.  When I was in my mid-to-upper 20&#39;s - I<br/>
could sing it and get from the zone to the Graveyard completely unmolested.<br/>
The Initiates and what have you that spawn along the way would never be a<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
    Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>
Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This is<br/>
a major train generator.<br/>
<br/>
    It seems to me they upgraded these mobs see invis.  Someone I grouped<br/>
with theorized that some wandering mob casts see invis on them - but who<br/>
knows?<br/>
