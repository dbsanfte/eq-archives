<div id="ygrps-yiv-957845015">Hee hee, how about this, the mob that triggers Babbinsbort to spawn isn&#39;t on<br/>
level 3.  It&#39;s all one zone remember.  Talking to a lady on the sister&#39;s<br/>
isle spawns an npc on another island you can&#39;t even see from there.  I know<br/>
I&#39;m a rabble rouser sometimes, but this would not surprise me at all.  I<br/>
know there is a gnome necro on level 1 and on level 2.  Hmmm, wonder what<br/>
killing both of them in succession and them heading down to look for Babbs<br/>
would do?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  If Clerics would start looking for these triggers instead of just <br/>
&gt;complaining I&#39;m willing to bet at least in some of the cases they will find<br/>
<br/>
&gt;them. Course complaining is much easier I will be the first to admit.<br/>

<br/>
Most of the time we were there there were 3 people in the zone (at the time <br/>
bard 29, cleric 28, the other guy was fighter 11 or some such I think).  My <br/>
friend and I went to the 3rd level and proceeded to kill everything that <br/>
spawned for 5 hours.  No Babbinsbort.  I had to log then, but my friend <br/>
stayed 10 (10! that is 15 hours in all) more hours and STILL NO GNOME.  No <br/>
placeholders were left standing, no triggers left unkilled, but no spawn.  <br/>
The problem is, simply, you must sometimes kill the placeholders 20 or 40 <br/>
times to get the rare spawn (love that random number generator). No exp, <br/>
tedious as all hell, and no reward after all that camping except for a <br/>
handful of plat.  We were both left with a vile taste in our mouths from <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be the first to agree (and to counsel my clerical friends) that the <br/>
quests are strictly optional, and nobody *needs* the quest armor. If you <br/>
can&#39;t stand the camping, don&#39;t. Having said that, these must be the <br/>
worst-designed quests I have seen.<br/>
