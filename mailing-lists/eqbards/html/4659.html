<div id="ygrps-yiv-973559573"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kblair@...">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious, does Celerity stack with Anthem de Arms? If so, I&#39;m interested<br/>
&gt; in why one would choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. My current lineup at<br/>
&gt; level 16 (DING! - I *love* the jig! It&#39;s so much more entertaining if while<br/>
&gt; watching it, you sing to yourself - &quot;Do a little dance, Make a little love,<br/>
&gt; Get down tonight! Get down tonight!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yesterday, I changed from using Jonthan&#39;s, hymn, wince or<br/>
sometimes Jonthan&#39;s, hymn, anthem, wince combination to<br/>
using just chant, jonthan and hymn. I might be just hallucinating<br/>
but I thought I noticed a HUGE difference in my melee ability.<br/>
I guess the dex bonus from chant really pays off. The 5% from<br/>
stacking anthem isn&#39;t that great compared to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Locating, Aquatic Ayre and Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carillion (even though I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t noticed it doing much good). When soloing I usually stack Jonthans,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And btw, the Carillion seems to increase _your_ faction with the<br/>
targeted person until you zone or re-log. Which means, any else<br/>
NPC with the same faction is also boosted. Hit carillion once and<br/>
all the npc&#39;s in one zone usually end up amiable if indifferent =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Songs that I&#39;ve noticed don&#39;t seem to do much are the Rhythm songs and the<br/>
&gt; Lucid Lullaby (Rats outside of Freeport were resisting it to me last night<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Lullaby is resisted quite a bit yes.. It&#39;s pretty much only good if you<br/>
have a group that whacks a multible mob situation one by one, and<br/>
you just lullaby time after time and hope for best =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms. Is it me<br/>
&gt; doing something wrong, or are these songs either very weak or completely<br/>
&gt; useless?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  They start to be useful when you start fighting casters. But at low levels,<br/>
if you fight a caster solo it will be a close call, and if you fight a caster<br/>
with group its usually a massacre =) Higher up, it will change that if you<br/>
fight a caster solo, it will be a massacre and if you fight it with a group<br/>
it can still be a close call ;)<br/>
