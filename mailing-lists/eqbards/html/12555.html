<br/>
  So who would you want?  <br/>
 <br/>
  A L41 bard, twisting Elemental (47 magic, 47 heat, 47 cold)<br/>
                       Guardian  (47 magic)<br/>
<br/>
  or <br/>
<br/>
  A L50 bard, twisting Elemental (56 magic, 56 heat, 56 cold)<br/>
                       Guardian  (56 magic)<br/>
<br/>
  [I think I got those numbers right, correct me if I&#39;m wrong]<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s really a no brainer, to me.<br/>
<br/>
  All the servers that I know of currently have no excuse for bringing<br/>
  anyone less than L49, unless:<br/>
  <br/>
  1) you are just funning around, wow a dragon, cool.<br/>
  2) it&#39;s your guild event, and you are up for dying.<br/>
  3) it&#39;s your friends who happen to all be L50, and just you are lower.<br/>
<br/>
  The elite guild, as much as I dislike them, on our server killed <br/>
  Nagafen less than 90 mins after the server came up.  They are all L50,<br/>
  and have the best stuff in the game.  They know exactly what to do with<br/>
  less than 25 people.  For that, I respect them.  But that&#39;s about it.<br/>
<br/>
  All other guilds who have attempted Vox have failed, and failed<br/>
  badly.  From what I understand you have to have to right people.<br/>
  Since the pool of available people is large on most servers, why<br/>
  in the world would you pick a knowledgable lower level person over <br/>
  a knowledgable higher level one?  You cannot bring everyone, so<br/>
  who do you bring?<br/>
