but we also aren&#39;t one of the baby servers.<br/>
<br/>
Crushbone:  Dirk price (reasonable) 15pp, (max) 20pp<br/>
Anywhere else:  Dirk price (reasonable) 30pp, (max) 35pp.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who got a dirk for 5pp last night in crushbone.<br/>
Remember they are lore items, and people farming D&#39;Vinn have<br/>
to sell the dirks quickly to loot another.  You are doing them<br/>
a favor by wanting to buy it (allbeit it promotes farming, but<br/>
how are you gonna outdamage a level 24 wizard?).<br/>
