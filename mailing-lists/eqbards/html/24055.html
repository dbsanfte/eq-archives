<div id="ygrps-yiv-936385050">Its true we can definetly hold our own, not underpowered but not overpowered<br/>
nor &quot;balanced&quot;.  Just this morning enterend karnors, nothin happening,<br/>
couple people shoutin for a group, we make one head to right moat.  Was me,<br/>
2 warrior, a mage and a rogue and a LD druid for bout half an hour.  We had<br/>
constant pulls no downtime, in fact i think we were just as fast when druid<br/>
was missing as when she was there. 2-3 mob pulls no prob, charm one on extra<br/>
and voila.  We even did this a couple times with a sentry of sathir.  Was<br/>
fun, druid rarely had to heal as she did a group chloro and i was doing full<br/>
regen so we were going at it with about 50 or so regen.  We later lost a<br/>
warrior and got a chanter when we had moved to dead cappy.  Great group in<br/>
all, got a full bub in a wee bit more then an hour which i havent done in a<br/>
long time (in karnors anyways).  Was just a fluke group, I&#39;d never grouped<br/>
with any of them and everything worked like a well oiled machine, but wasnt<br/>
cause any of us were &quot;overpowered&quot; 8)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hehe if we&#39;re so overpowered why is it there&#39;s only 2 bards in my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>guild above 30? being me at 50 and another at 56?  Sure we have a <br/>
couple twinks in the teens and 20&#39;s but that&#39;s just that, a twink... <br/>
Well one of em might be leveling up to 50+ since his necro is 60. If <br/>
we&#39;d be so overpowered the populations would be like that of a druid <br/>
or necro soloers...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because Bards are harder to play?  People don&#39;t understand just how <br/>
powerful Bards can be?  People are twinking new characters to be able <br/>
to contribute to big raids, where we lose power?  Because the general <br/>
perception among EQ players is you need a Warrior, Enchanter, and <br/>
Cleric to start a group?  Anything else is unnecessary, duplicate <br/>
Warriors is preferred?<br/>
<br/>
There are many possible reasons why there aren&#39;t many Bards in <br/>
comparison to other classes.  You&#39;d have to ask each and every player <br/>
who doesn&#39;t play a Bard to find out what&#39;s the most common, or most <br/>
accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying, that in day to day pickup groups, we have a lot of <br/>
power.  This is from my personal experience and really only applies <br/>
at the level I&#39;m at.  And I&#39;m far from the world&#39;s greatest Bard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re overpowered.  I AM saying we&#39;re definitely not <br/>
underpowered.  My original point C&P below was trying to explain that <br/>
people aren&#39;t looking at &quot;How difficult a class is to play&quot; when <br/>
they&#39;re talking about Bards being powerful. They&#39;re looking at the <br/>
best played Bard and seeing just what we can contribute.  There&#39;s no <br/>
check box for &quot;Has had Carpal Tunnel Surgery&quot; in the Power Chart.<br/>

&gt; taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
&gt; playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
&gt; different comparisons, really.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>
&gt; with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>
&gt; fruits.&quot;<br/>
