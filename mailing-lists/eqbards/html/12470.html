<b>Subject:</b> RE: Powerleveling bards (was Cazic Thule Slain....] <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551707306">When the new server came up - I decided to try a wizard - never had a<br/>
wizard, and didn&#39;t much care for a lot of ones I&#39;d met in the past - but<br/>
willing to give it a shot. One thing I CAN say - having played a bard for<br/>
so very long (and enchanter - both group oriented classes) I find my basic<br/>
nature and tactics carry over.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what other class you may play - I guess if you play a bard long<br/>
enough, you observe what NOT to do with other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Just hit 20 last night in unrest - memmed my new spells - and which one did<br/>
I use most?  Stun. My party was shocked and amazed that a wizard LIKED to<br/>
stun, hehehehe. <br/>
<br/>
As far as powerleveling - I guess my only experience there is on the<br/>
helping side with my bard. A 20something bard - at the right camp, with<br/>
lullaby - is a newbies first and bestest friend. My husband calls himself<br/>
permanewbie - he tends to get really frustrated around lvl 15 and start all<br/>
over again. Many is the time I&#39;ve used the generic bandit camp in lesser<br/>
faye to help lower level friends train - starting, oh...bout lvl 7 or 8 -<br/>
just as soon as they can hit the blasted things. Pull with a bellow and<br/>
just lullaby, bard hate at it&#39;s finest. Since they can&#39;t hit me, they can&#39;t<br/>
hurt me - and they hardly ever switch targets to that little bug biting<br/>
their backside. Can do the same thing in Crusbone.<br/>
<br/>
So, while we may not be the best powerlevelers in the game ourselves - we<br/>
are a very powerful tool to help folks crawl out of the plain vanilla<br/>
newbie levels.<br/>
<br/>
And - it never hurts to have lvl 50&#39;s remember you in the months to come<br/>
*smile*.<br/>

&gt;Clerics have Quite good stuns that sometimes it is worth taking another look<br/>
&gt;at.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The most important skills to learn, IMHO, are how to be a good group member.<br/>
&gt;Everything else can be taught. If you&#39;re willing to listen, to die, and to<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Powerleveling anyone can be easily done with a higher (lvl 24 spells I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; think) druid. They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>
&gt;&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>
&gt;&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at. </span></blockquote></div>
