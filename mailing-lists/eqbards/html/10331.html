<div id="ygrps-yiv-165514381">In my opinion, this is the course of action Verant should follow when it<br/>
comes to making changes in the game.  Make the mobs tougher i.e. higher<br/>
level, more spells to cast, higher resist rates, etc. instead of making the<br/>
players weaker.  It seems to me that it all balances out in the long run.  I<br/>
also think it would generate less negative publicity and player resentment.<br/>

new quests instead of nerfing)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;    <br/>
&gt;    Is it being resourceful?  Is it taking advantage of the code?<br/>
&gt;    Does it really matter?  Once I learned of a player &#39;exploiting&#39;<br/>
&gt;    a method against a particular mob, I would alter the behavior<br/>
&gt;    of the monster under those effects to create a more challenging<br/>
&gt;    confrontation.  It wasn&#39;t to ruin the player&#39;s experience, it<br/>
&gt;    was to heighten it.  I am a player of accomplishment.  If I<br/>
&gt;    play a game that&#39;s too easy, I tend to get tired easily.  If I<br/>
&gt;    play a game that offers new challenges each time, I tend to get<br/>
&gt;    addicted, ie EQ.<br/>
