stores tacked on an extra charge for using a credit card.  <br/>
See, the way credit card companies make money (aside from<br/>
outlandish interest rates) is that they get a percentage of<br/>
every charge made on the card - usually 2%-5%.  The stores<br/>
didn&#39;t like having to give 2%-5% of their income to another<br/>
company, so they started charging customers a credit card<br/>
surcharge.<br/>
<br/>
The credit card companies didn&#39;t like that, so they lobbied<br/>
Congress, and got a law passed banning credit card surcharges.<br/>
The stores complied with the law, and began giving cash<br/>
discounts instead.  The people using credit cards still have<br/>
to pay more, but now everyone feels better about it.<br/>
<br/>
Strengthening the mobs or weakening the players, the net<br/>
effect is the same.  The only difference is one of perception.<br/>
What you suggest will make players feel better about the game,<br/>
but it won&#39;t make a functional difference - the game will<br/>
still be more difficult.<br/>
