<div id="ygrps-yiv-637694019">Actually the character that would benefit the most is the halfling warrior<br/>
who used to group exclusively with hybrids.  Since the hybrids are no longer<br/>
taking an extra percentage of xp due to the old xp splitting system he will<br/>
get more.<br/>
<br/>
Old System:  1000 xp<br/>
<br/>
		1100 with group bonus<br/>
<br/>
		5*1.4= 7 +1*.85 = 7.85<br/>
<br/>
		1100/7.85 = 140<br/>
<br/>
		140 * .85 = 119 the halfling&#39;s share<br/>
<br/>
New System:  1200 xp  (for 20% dungeon bonus)<br/>
<br/>
		1440 xp (with new group bonus)<br/>
<br/>
		1440/6 = 240 the halfling&#39;s new share<br/>

First, we are dynamically creating &quot;experience,&quot; the advancement mechanism<br/>
in EverQuest, to offset an additional &quot;experience requirement&quot; attached to<br/>
certain character classes. Secondly, we are creating additional experience<br/>
to further reward those who adventure in groups. Finally, we are increasing<br/>
the experience rewards in some areas of the world.<br/>
<br/>
The overall effect is that some players, depending on style, should be able<br/>
to advance their characters up to nearly twice as fast as they once could.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was taken from EQ vault. ^^^<br/>

Thats sounds out of whack to me, so here are my Max increase calculations:<br/>
<br/>
Group of all hybrids (DOn&#39;t laugh I was in one last week in karnors, I(bard)<br/>
was the primary healer...)<br/>
<br/>
Old xp = 1000<br/>
+10% (for old group bonus) = 1100<br/>
Each player gets 183 xp<br/>
<br/>
New system (in a dungeon which got a 20% xp bump)<br/>
<br/>
Total xp = 1200<br/>
+20% (new group bonus) = 1440<br/>
Each player gets 336 xp (1440/6*1.4)<br/>
<br/>
Not quite doubles (which would have been 366 xp), but not far off.  Of<br/>
course this is a truly bizarre circumstance where a group of hybrids would<br/>
be fighting togteher in newly bumped zone with no deaths...<br/>
