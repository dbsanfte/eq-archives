Verant finally fixed it so that snare doesn&#39;t override root/ensnare/whatever<br/>
<br/>
Which is annoying to say the least but at least it makes some convoluted<br/>
sense.  If chains isn&#39;t breaking early anymore I&#39;ll be happy with that.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Chains Fixed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been noticing some strange things with chains recently.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be breaking early anymore (except rarely).  In fact, I don&#39;t get the<br/>
break message until it would normally expire, even when root is cast after<br/>
chains.  Also, when I rechain after root is cast, chains does not seem to<br/>
break root anymore, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard for me to test this out further as the root I&#39;m working with is<br/>
a Mage pet&#39;s root, but here&#39;s what I&#39;m noticing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When mob is fleeing (experienced this in Karnors), pet roots and the mob<br/>
turns around to attack.  Obviously, we can&#39;t have this :p so I chain.  Mob<br/>
stays facing the party like it&#39;s still rooted.  It doesn&#39;t even turn around<br/>
for a second (like if the pet had rooted immediately after I chained) and I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen a 2nd root message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else noticing any of this?  And, anyone else with access to a more<br/>
standard root willing to test?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If root and chains are in fact stacking, I&#39;m not sure if this is a plus or<br/>
not.  I am always grouped with a mage, so the pet used to kill chains ALOT.<br/>
It&#39;s kinda nice to keep the slowdown effect while it&#39;s rooted, but I&#39;d like<br/>
to see the mob stand there patiently trying to run away, too. :)<br/>
