Well, the original poster did say that this mage had let his pet kill <br/>
people in the past.  It would just be giving him a taste of his own <br/>
medicine.<br/>
<br/>
But how about this, let the pet beat the hell out of them, and at the <br/>
last minute before charm wears off and they die, pulse fear.  Pet <br/>
runs, mage stays, and you finish them off.  No exp lost either.<br/>
