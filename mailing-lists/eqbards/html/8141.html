Going out on a limb here...<br/>

I have read over these posts and many of them seem to be traditional <br/>
arguments in an age old discussion. There are many many good points on both <br/>
sides of the isle. I suppose what is needed is to look at this from Verants <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
As always DISCLAIMER: *grins* this is just one possible explanation. Its <br/>
mine so it probably isn&#39;t correct :)<br/>
<br/>
The role of the Bard is to streamline a groups effectiveness. Roleplay aside <br/>
for a moment. It has been said that we are the jack of all trades and the <br/>
master of none. That isn&#39;t exactly true. We are the masters of one trade, <br/>
group effectiveness. No one else can do it as good as we can. Alas, its a <br/>
heavy burden :) Everyone who has played a Bard knows the fundamentals of <br/>
this and in the higher levels 35+ it is even more evident. That being true, <br/>
an adjustement to our class directly effects the performance of as many as 5 <br/>
other individuals at any given time (ie the group). So when they nerf/twink <br/>
a Bard they are actually twinking the overall game dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
We have seen many posts regarding a particular song and why it renders us <br/>
stronger or weaker relative to the other classes abilities (ie bellow <br/>
damage, charm, etc.) I believe the reason Verant is hesitant to tweak us <br/>
much at all is because of our relationship with the other classes. They do <br/>
this for everyone. But, since a DoT from a Shaman is more or less a solo <br/>
act, they can nerf/twink it with more variety. By solo I don&#39;t mean in a non <br/>
group sense but in that even grouped it is an act that is done by one person <br/>
to one npc (AoE asside) in either a group or solo environment. By twinking <br/>
our Antehem, for an example, they don&#39;t just increase our ability to melee <br/>
they increase up to 6 peoples and that can have a drastic impact on game <br/>
mechanics. I think they are afraid that by screwing up in making us more <br/>
effective they will make the rest of the classes too effective. Its hard to <br/>
judge the interaction of these changes in detail without a great deal of <br/>
testing. I am not sure they are testing outside the game as much as <br/>
observing and trying to correct exisiting game dynamics to match some <br/>
unpublished, ephemeral ideal.<br/>
<br/>
Programmer: It didn&#39;t crash the testserver Brad, it *should* do what you <br/>
want.<br/>
Brad: Good, lets update next Monday...<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday rolls around and we all get to read the latest hate/love posts :) In <br/>
a very real sense, if the above is true, we are the most influential class <br/>
in the game. Not in a sense that we can take on the World but in a sense <br/>
that we could (under the right conditions) allow a group of 6 to take on the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
