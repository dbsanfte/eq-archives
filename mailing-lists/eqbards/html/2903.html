<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003250807">That&#39;s just it, I hadn&#39;t been doing ANYTHING - we had pretty much just<br/>
gotten there (well from rezoning).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to unrest numerous times since 13th (just made 20th now) and<br/>
never EVER gotten that kind of reaction, nor have I tried to play those two<br/>
particular songs there till now.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>

&gt;&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What were you doing before?  Unrest has a lot of pathing<br/>
&gt;problems.  What happened to you sounds like you let a mob go<br/>
&gt;back through the house to chase you, or a train passed by as<br/>
&gt;you were fighting something or playing a buffing/healing song.<br/>
&gt;In the former case, the mob can run past other mobs and<br/>
&gt;activate them or add you to their hate list.  You kill your<br/>
&gt;original pull, but the other monsters end up being trained by<br/>
&gt;someone else.  In the latter case because bards seem to<br/>
&gt;attract more attention from passing mobs that are fighting<br/>
&gt;others, you can easily get on the hate list of a passing<br/>
&gt;train, which does not seem to be a problem for other classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The train gets pulled to the zone and people try to take it.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes they manage, other times they all have to zone.<br/>
&gt;When they zone, they&#39;re removed from the hate list, and you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;the only one left so they all make a beeline for you (well, in<br/>
&gt;Unrest they make a lot of U-turns too).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I see a train about to pass by, I try to stop any songs I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;singing.  That seems to help stop anything from the train<br/>
&gt;peeling off to join our fight.  It really is ridiculous<br/>
&gt;though.  The bartender once dropped off someone who attacked<br/>
&gt;him and was pulling him, and chased me out.  The guy gave me<br/>
&gt;an earful for &quot;stealing&quot; his pull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, another possible explanation.  There are some idiots who<br/>
&gt;when they get a train, instead of zoning or gracefully letting<br/>
&gt;themselves be killed, they drag it through all the other<br/>
&gt;players in the hopes the train will get off them and on the<br/>
&gt;others.  Since bards tend to be mob magnets, they usually end<br/>
&gt;up getting dumped on us.<br/>
