&gt;But - um.. what does the second-to-last stanza refer to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m very sad to say I had the horrid luck to see<br/>
Upon the plain, through fog and rain, The Thing That Must Not Be.<br/>
To show their ire, the gods rained fire, and both of us were charred...<br/>
Apparently the gods could see the Thing but not the bard.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm on rereading it this morning it seems less clear than it did at 1am <br/>
last night. = P  Basically, the point of this stanza was to show how bards <br/>
can be stricken by the wrath of the gods because they were standing too near <br/>
the gods&#39; actual target.  I&#39;ll look for a way to make this more clear.<br/>
