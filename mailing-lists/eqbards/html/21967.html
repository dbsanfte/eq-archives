Of course those 30 mobs were the equivalent to that bard (at 40 something)<br/>
that moss snakes are to me.  Who cares if I can mez 1000 except for a fun<br/>
showoff trick.<br/>

of the nerf, I wasn&#39;t high enough leve to have the song yet. :-P<br/>

I do remember reading stories of bards in Blackburrow mezzing 30+ mobs at a <br/>
time, which probably prompted the nerf. However, now I believe you can only <br/>
affect at most 4 mobs, so that kind of solves that worry.<br/>

companies with good public relations. Hmm. Nah. Ok, we have a president who <br/>
has dignity and integrity. Damn.<br/>

Nevermind.<br/>
