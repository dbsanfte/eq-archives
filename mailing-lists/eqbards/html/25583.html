<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978740999">Few Things to remember about Gore..<br/>
<br/>
1. Get 10+ nukers 54+, Mages, Druids, Wizards, heck even necros nukes and<br/>
life taps should stack.<br/>
2. Shammy, Enchanter,Bard, Druid to lower resists to the max. (Malo, Tash,<br/>
Occlusion, Ro together should take FR down so far that a lvl 54+ could nuke<br/>
with Fire based DD)<br/>
3. At least 2 Lvl 60ish tanks to take hits and taunt while rest of the ppl<br/>
nuke.<br/>
4. Bards go in caster groups to keep them from running(fear) Bards shoudl<br/>
twist Guardian + Elemental old school style, Send in nukers when Melee (even<br/>
slowed melee) has her down to 65% or so.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Gorenaire<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all - I just got back from a two week tour of Germany with my band.<br/>
Before I left we camped Ragefire for a cleric&#39;s epic - and he dropped a red<br/>
scale that my guild defaulted to me.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we tried Gorenaire and got wiped twice.  That damn fear doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to care what your resistance is &lt;sigh&gt; got her down to 50 percent the second<br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho - any advice from people who&#39;ve had success with this sucker?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
