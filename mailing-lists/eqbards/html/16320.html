&gt;Hehe<br/>
&gt;CNE, MCSE, CCNA myself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, I was a Senior Guide in the Guide program and some &#39;inside&#39;<br/>
&gt;information given to me by a few former GMs pretty bluntly pointed out that<br/>
&gt;Verant does NOT pay competitive salaries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t even DREAM about working for them.  They&#39;re asking for a prince when<br/>
&gt;they won&#39;t pay for a pauper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hehehe did you know Verant GM&#39;s are lucky to make $10/hour<br/>
&gt;In SAN DIEGO CA????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep - One of my former employees came back to Houston after being a GM - we <br/>
were paying him more than his job at Verant to do basic technical <br/>
support.  Now that&#39;s sad.<br/>
