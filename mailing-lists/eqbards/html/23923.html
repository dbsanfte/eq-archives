<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673128356">Several Test server Bards posted that this fixed the insta-breaks, but that the song is still random<br/>
duration.  Unlike every other snare in the game.  Even though it is also a debuff song that would be nice<br/>
to twist.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Today&#39;s patch message....note the bard section and bug fixes.  Verant has<br/>
&gt; &gt;actually said that our single target snares breaking early was a bug! Also,<br/>
&gt; &gt;DDD was upgraded...but I have honestly only ever loaded DDD once, and doubt<br/>
&gt; &gt;I will load it after this fix.<br/>

&gt; no, that&#39;s not exactly what they said.  i think this only fixes the instabreaks that we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen occasionally.  i doubt they made the song fixed duration.<br/>
