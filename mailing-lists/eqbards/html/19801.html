<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084700452">I don&#39;t even really notice this because 90% of the time, I am looking <br/>
at my messages scrolling by.  This helps me to twist songs (along w/ <br/>
counting beats in my head) and so I will always see the messages that <br/>
say when your spells are going to wear off.  I know that Invis(undead <br/>
and regular), Illusions, Endure Breath, Levitate, etc. all give you a <br/>
couple of *warning* messages.  i.e.  &quot;You feel you are about to look <br/>
like yourself.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Ok I missunderstood the first question:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bard Icons do not flash for the bard because their duration is <br/>
shorter than<br/>
&gt; the flash warning period (ie: They&#39;d be flashing all the time.  <br/>
Annoying to<br/>
&gt; say the least)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, there&#39;s a long standing bug/feature/whatever that IF you <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; playing a song (heh are we ever NOT playing one?) then NONE of your <br/>
icons<br/>
&gt; will flash.  Not sure if that&#39;s because the client can&#39;t tell which <br/>
are bard<br/>
&gt; icons and which are not if one of ours is active.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Either way.  If you have a song effect ACTIVE during the time that <br/>
a spell<br/>
&gt; is wearing off it&#39;s icon won&#39;t flash.  If you are not playing a <br/>
song (ie:<br/>
&gt; have no song effects active) your icons will flash before fading.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>
