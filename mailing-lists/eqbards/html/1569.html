<div id="ygrps-yiv-531873423">Any of you not have a chance to check and go thru your email for a few days<br/>
and end up with 300 Bard emails to go thru?  :-)  I&#39;m 208 behind and instead<br/>
of answering each thing as I come to it, I&#39;ll combine everything into one<br/>
email and fire it off when done... that way, I can add and delete if<br/>
questions have been answered.....<br/>
<br/>
Assist command - The person you&#39;re assisting &quot;seems&quot; to have to have both<br/>
the creature targeted (makes sense) AND have auto attack on.  When my ranger<br/>
friend is pulling a creature in, I usually target him early and try to<br/>
assist as he&#39;s running back... Doesn&#39;t seem to work all the time as he&#39;s<br/>
probably got me or a party member tracked to find his way back.  Seems<br/>
there&#39;s also a range on it.  I also network and my GF plays next to me...<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that I have to hit &quot;A&quot; for auto-attack before her assist will<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Charismatic Carillion - I used it on an Enchanter NPC in Qeynos that looked<br/>
down on me to get a cheap little quest of returning some bat fur.  Going to<br/>
check prices on Combine&#39;s and Well Balanced very soon as i just got level 17<br/>
and am in dire need of a 2nd weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Hate list for Lullaby - Seems that maybe it does Nix the complete hate<br/>
list... but when it wakes up, it still remembers being asleep.  Since the<br/>
Bard put it to sleep, the Bard is the only one on the hate list at that<br/>
point.  This seems to confirm this thought I had - &quot;I&#39;ve noticed though that<br/>
once a mob is lulled, your hatedness by the creature is very low. If you<br/>
don&#39;t do anything else to it the next hit by someone else will draw it off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On Purposeful Trains - It is bannable, if they can prove it was intentional.<br/>
Very very tough to do as a situation I was in showed.  Our party was in the<br/>
Gorge on Xegony.  There was a character wipe that affected approx 200<br/>
characters and the last save was 2 weeks before.  This one character,<br/>
Damarr, in particular had lost 9 levels, down to level 20, or so he said.  I<br/>
heard him shouting in Rivervale, complaining whining, bitching, screaming at<br/>
Verant, etc.  I ignored him.  We&#39;re fighting some muddites in the gorge and<br/>
I noticed that the frequency of them coming in seems to be a bit much...<br/>
we&#39;d dispatch a group of 2 or 3 and there&#39;d be 2 more showing up... Seemed a<br/>
bit strange, since the zone was relatively uncrowded and their wandering<br/>
patterns aren&#39;t THAT frequent.  I thought nothing of it, but after killing 5<br/>
or so, we zoned to runnyeye and healed up.  Back in the gorge a few minutes<br/>
later and we&#39;re fighting and no less than 4 Mino&#39;s come running in.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t see how, cause I was engrossed in battle, but my GF had seen Damarr<br/>
leading them in.  She also mentioned she saw him leading in the muddites<br/>
earlier.  We zoned, barely alive and I lost my cool and fired off a few<br/>
choice words saying that We were not verant and he shouldn&#39;t be trying to<br/>
destroy us cause he&#39;s pissed at them.  Back in the Gorge and other people<br/>
are shouting about him and he starts to shout.  He ADMITS in a shout that<br/>
he&#39;s trying to kill everyone cause Verant screwed him over.  My girlfriend,<br/>
my party, and I, and who knows how many other people in the zone at that<br/>
time have screen shots of his admission.  We all petitioned and finally a<br/>
guide showed up.  I was the one that was contacted and I was instructed to<br/>
try and get him to admit it again in a shout.  I&#39;m thinking ONCE was pretty<br/>
damn good for someone to admit it, but twice?  The screen shots apparently<br/>
aren&#39;t good enuf, since they can be doctored.... SHEESH!!!  So, it was my<br/>
job to try and goad him into admitting in a shout or a say (guide was invis<br/>
and parked right next to him) that he was purposefully training... Not a<br/>
chance in hell of that happening twice.  All I did was make myself look like<br/>
an asshole for &quot;stooping to his level&quot; and arguing and fighting with him in<br/>
shouts... as one comment said, &quot;It looks like a 12 year old argument&quot;.  I<br/>
ended up apologizing to the guide for wasting her time and resisted the urge<br/>
to throw the monitor on the floor.  : P  It is VERY hard to prove someone<br/>
trains intentionally.  This guy did it multiple times and nothing happened.<br/>
While I don&#39;t condone training as a way of getting revenge (too many other<br/>
innocent people can be slaughtered) and I would never have the balls to do<br/>
it myself, the only thing proven to me (By Verant) is that while bannable,<br/>
it simply is not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
