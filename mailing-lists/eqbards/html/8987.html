<div id="ygrps-yiv-173451495">Everyone all over EQ (on this list, other lists, websites, in the game...)<br/>
claim to &quot;know&quot; how things like this work...  We have just seen<br/>
contradictory posts here.  Only people who have access to the EQ source code<br/>
could really answer that question (you could say design document - but<br/>
considering the bugs we know about....)<br/>
<br/>
All we have is theories based on observation - and who knows how much the<br/>
dreaded random number generator affects this?  Perhaps it&#39;s the playing of<br/>
songs.  Other theories - high charisma.  Low Hit points...<br/>
<br/>
I would guess that at times Class is a factor.  I&#39;ve seen messages from Mobs<br/>
lately - I forget the exact wording - but to the affect that &quot;I hate bards<br/>
like you...&quot;  So in this case - I would say bard hate does exist.<br/>
 Otherwise - your guess is as good as mine!<br/>

&gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really exist...<br/>
Anyone actually have proof that it does?<br/>
