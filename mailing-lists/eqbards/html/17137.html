<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778386062">You need to be level 46 or better to enter the alter:planes.<br/>
<br/>
Plane of Fear you can run into through the portal in the spec cave.  But<br/>
there are usually alot of patrollers at the zone in spot.<br/>
<br/>
Plane of Sky and Plane of Hate require a wizard to gate you in.  The reagent<br/>
for the spell is like 200pp plus or minus.  And there are usually lots of<br/>
patrollers near the zone in spot although I have made the run to the &#39;safe<br/>
spot&#39; and camped out (ie not died).<br/>
<br/>
You can gate or be gated out of any of the planes. Although Plane of Sky you<br/>
can just jump off the island and land in the water off East Freeport<br/>
(sometimes unintentionally).  And I hear tell that there is a portal you can<br/>
run through to get out of Plane of Hate - but your guild would need to clear<br/>
CT&#39;s temple first for you to run to it.  Have not seen that one first hand -<br/>
although we have cleared the temple - just did not bother to go look.<br/>
<br/>
You are non-agro where you enter the Plane of Sky - so that maybe your best<br/>
bet.  The main problem is you need to be 20 levels higher to zone in.  Heh -<br/>
go try running into the TV in the PoF cave before you turn 46.<br/>

&gt; This is a truly innane thought, but, like so many things in my life comes<br/>
&gt; with a voiceover that whispers &quot;what if it just worked?&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Is there any plane that on, say a weekend night, I would have ANY chance<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; getting to and offering NagaThin Muffins N&#39; Milk in shout and THEN (here&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the hard part) getting back alive? I know it is different on different<br/>
&gt; servers but is it even remotely possible?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All I need is the screenshot, I SURE don&#39;t need to stay there for any<br/>
length<br/>
&gt; of time...<br/>
