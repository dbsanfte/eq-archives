&quot;I am a relatively new player to this game. I started<br/>
                                  around Christmas of 1999. But despite <br/>
many complaints<br/>
                                  from many different people about <br/>
imbalances and<br/>
                                  gameplay issues, i still think it&#39;s a <br/>
great game. I love<br/>
                                  the fact that a worrior can kick, duel <br/>
weld, wear nice<br/>
                                  armour, and have tons of HP. I love a <br/>
cleric&#39;s ability to<br/>
                                  heal its members, to stun monsters, and <br/>
to cure<br/>
                                  various diseases, and remove poisons. I <br/>
love a druid&#39;s<br/>
                                  ability to do a little of everything, i <br/>
love Spirit of<br/>
                                  Wolves, i love share wolf form, and their <br/>
ability to<br/>
                                  group teleport. I love a wizard&#39;s ability <br/>
to Cast cool<br/>
                                  looking spells and unleash their wrath <br/>
upon hordes of<br/>
                                  monsters. I love a mage&#39;s ability to <br/>
summon items,<br/>
                                  pets, and weapons. I love a shadow <br/>
knight&#39;s harm<br/>
                                  touch, their life drain spells, and <br/>
others. I love rogues<br/>
                                  for their ability to backstab, to evade <br/>
and to hide. I<br/>
                                  love a shamen&#39;s ability to buff and to <br/>
summon cool<br/>
                                  animal pets. I love an enchanters&#39; <br/>
ability to change<br/>
                                  appearance, to mez monsters and to <br/>
control the life<br/>
                                  and death of a group. I love rangers; <br/>

interdepence<br/>
                                  of various classes in order to succeed in <br/>
the game. i<br/>
