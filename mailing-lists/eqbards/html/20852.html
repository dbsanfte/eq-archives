<b>Subject:</b> Bard&#39;s Guild on Povar <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312699181">So, there is now an all-bard guild on Povar, the Songweavers of Povar&quot; I<br/>
think. I have been asked twice if I was interested, and while I usually make<br/>
it a point to not join any guild who would ask me to join cold, I am curious<br/>
about them. Anyone ever run across them? Are they on other servers? I am<br/>
VERY curious what guild hunts look like :)<br/>
