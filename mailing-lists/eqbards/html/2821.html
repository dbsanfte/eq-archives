&gt;&gt; Another example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sorry you have to operate at 98% potential effectiveness<br/>
&gt;using a different weapon in your second hand instead of<br/>
&gt;another dirk.  Just think - if you were wielding two dirks and<br/>
&gt;found another better weapon, you&#39;d have to operate at 98%<br/>
&gt;effectiveness until you could get another of that new weapon.  <br/>
&gt;Why doesn&#39;t Verant just make the mobs drop two of each weapon<br/>
&gt;at a time?  Oh the horror.<br/>
&gt;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The game is perfectly playable using a different weapon in<br/>
&gt;your off hand.  What you are complaining about is a &quot;want,&quot;<br/>
&gt;not a &quot;need.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>
delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter <br/>
windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>
different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt;</div>
