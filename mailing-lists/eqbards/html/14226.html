<b>Subject:</b> Selling to Krak? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138103749">Last night I tried to sell to Krak, the vendor at the top of the Aviak<br/>
village in SK. I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>
exit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>
dubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>
indifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell. His response was different, though,<br/>
saying that he doesn&#39;t talk to Half-Elves, much less sell to them.<br/>
<br/>
I may have lost faction a while back when someone pulled Krak down to the<br/>
ramp and I whacked on him before I knew who he was. Think I was still in the<br/>
zone when he died.<br/>
<br/>
I can still sell to centaurs, so no worries. Just curious about others&#39;<br/>
experience with Krak boy and Carillon not doing anything.<br/>

&gt; You would sing carillon first before sneaking.  The faction bonus it gives<br/>
&gt; lasts until you zone. You then either activate illusion or sneak.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; almost 100% certain the illusion will give you a better /con than sneaking<br/>
&gt; so thats the best way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure sneaking just sets you to indifferent with a<br/>
merchant regardless of faction (it&#39;s really a bug that you can<br/>
use it at all to shop).  So if illusion+song results in higher<br/>
than indifferent faction, it will be better than<br/>
sneak+anything else.<br/>
