<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369930205">Just to let you know the Basalt Carapace item is also<br/>
NO DROP.  Someone was shouting that it was on a corpse<br/>
if anyone wanted it in Lower Guk last night. <br/>
Unfortunately I was down in the Frenzy room trying to<br/>
get a sash.  <br/>
<br/>
So I assume that all the items we need are NO DROP,<br/>
except maybe the Lambent Stones?  I for one hope most<br/>
of the stuff we need is NO DROP, would keep things<br/>
more interesting.  Although, my Gypsy Lute did not get<br/>
changed to NO DROP after the patch, so who knows. <br/>
