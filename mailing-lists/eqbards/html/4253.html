<div id="ygrps-yiv-493393957">I met him when the patch for mail was out.  I was there trying to do the<br/>
mail thing then I saw him.  U are lucky you did not have to fight his pet<br/>
too.  When I saw him he just came right after me so I just zone.  When I<br/>
came back after 5 minutes he was gone and noone has seen him.  I thought it<br/>
was verant way of telling us that there are a lot of unique NPC out there<br/>
with great loot.  Very disappointed to hear there was no loot.<br/>
