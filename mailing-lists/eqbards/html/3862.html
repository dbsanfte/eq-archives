<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747873380"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>
&gt; (i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>
&gt; a bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; still 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>
&gt; instrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>
&gt; it gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>
&gt; trying to switch weapons later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The one tip I can give, which I posted before:<br/>
<br/>
If one of your weapons can be thrown (Mino Axe, Draggon Dirk, etc), put<br/>
the Ranged Weapon slot in place of the open inventory space.  This of<br/>
course assumes you don&#39;t use ranged weapons (most Bards don&#39;t bother,<br/>
especially after getting Bellow at 12th).<br/>
<br/>
To switch weapons and instruments, simply move the Axe/Dagger/whatever<br/>
from the primary or secondary hand slot to the ranged weapon slot.<br/>
Now do the normal item shuffling till everything is where it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
This also lets you get any magical stat or resist bonuses of the weapon<br/>
(ie the +DEX and +MR of the Dirk) while it&#39;s in your ranged slot...<br/>
<br/>
I do this.  Works quite nicely. :)<br/>
