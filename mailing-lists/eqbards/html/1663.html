<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183757287">I think we are saying the same thing here - yes the bard gets the mob&#39;s<br/>
attention but it&#39;s because of the way mob ai works - they can sense who they<br/>
should kill and they see you as both dangerous to them and as easy to kill.<br/>
Because you are in the party that attacked one of their party - you get put<br/>
on their hate list.  All of them now hate you.  You are right it is a<br/>
programming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>
<br/>
Part of this is seen when a party member gets bounced by a high level npc -<br/>
like brigand or a gryf.  Once one party member gets on a hate list all party<br/>
members are added especially if you are playing a song that is buffing them<br/>
or whatever.  So everyone has to zone to clear the hate list otherwise the<br/>
mob will come hunting all of the party members.<br/>
<br/>
And I still think better tactics can mitigate your situation.  Don&#39;t pull<br/>
all of them (a cleric can lull some of them and you wont get 4 hitting on<br/>
you - only 2 :-) - I suppose your tanks don&#39;t mind because they can take all<br/>
of them no problemo but all of them will attack you if you are in their<br/>
sight.  Might be interesting to see just how far away you have to be before<br/>
they don&#39;t come to you instead of the tanks.  I know they will run around a<br/>
couple tanks if you are near but I wonder what would happen if you were<br/>
outside of the range where you can read the icons?  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone in your party have camo?  Does camo work if you are singing/playing?<br/>

this..it is<br/>

singing a<br/>

something ..3 or 4<br/>

nothing(just to test<br/>

me<br/>

far worse<br/>

there is some<br/>
