<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416695877">All good suggestions if you have the play to afford them.  Some cheaper<br/>
suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
1HB:  Dwarven Mace, not magical but you can get it for free in Crushbone<br/>
(or pay maybe 20P elsewhere)<br/>
1HS:  Mino Axe till you can afford something better.  If you need a<br/>
magic weapon get a tentacle whip. (both cost like 5P)<br/>
Peirc:  Fine Steel Spear will serve you nicely till you can get a<br/>
Dragoon Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What you need to do is get a 1hb a pierce and a 1hs weapon.  Keep all 3<br/>
&gt; skills maxxed ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1HB:  One of the best bard weapons in the game (till much higher levels) is<br/>
&gt; the Staff of Writhing.  9dmg 33dly and a 48dmg proc that also interrupts<br/>
&gt; spell casters.  The staff starts proc&#39;ing at level 28.  The only real<br/>
&gt; drawback to this weapon is the -9 charisma hit.  But once your charisma is<br/>
&gt; up in the 130 range you really won&#39;t notice the penalty that much and the<br/>
&gt; staff is more than worth it if you are using melee combat.  Another good 1hb<br/>
&gt; is the BEM (Black Enamelled Mace) I believe it&#39;s 8dmg 28dly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1HS:  Uhh tons of good stuff<br/>
&gt; Pierce:  Some of the nicer ones are the Dragoon Dirk and the Obsidian shard.<br/>
&gt; There are others as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
