<div id="ygrps-yiv-735069154">Hehe now I heard hate was through Oasis?  And Air is reached in Rathe, seems<br/>
like it as it&#39;s high, high up on a pedestal and guarded by Aviaks.  All I<br/>
hear is talk about adding zones to Odus, nothing of the planes.  I suppose<br/>
we&#39;ll just have to wait.  All I know, there&#39;s some kind of portal down there<br/>
(I just assumed water because of all the ice everywhere and the fact one<br/>
must swim to get to the caverns).<br/>
