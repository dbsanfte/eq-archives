&gt; Mark my words, this will get nerfed.<br/>
&gt; Clerics currently use the level 19 buffs in place of the level 14 healing <br/>
&gt; spell, because it&#39;s just about as efficient, and now it&#39;ll be nearly <br/>
&gt; uninterruptable and chain-castable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heal has no recycle time. I think the problem they were addressing here<br/>
is that the recycle time also affects how long it takes to load the<br/>
spell, so after you memorize it, you have to sit around and wait 15-30<br/>
seconds before you can cast the darn thing even once. This is a royal<br/>
pain in the butt when you have to cast multiple buffs on people if you<br/>
do it by cycling different spell times through one slot, which most<br/>
people end up doing after L20 when they have plenty of other spells to<br/>
keep their slots full.<br/>
