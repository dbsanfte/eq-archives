<div id="ygrps-yiv-46043310"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ...  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>
&gt; ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>
&gt; extra attacks for part of a fight? ...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t suggest those two things, no, but that misses the point a bit.  When <br/>
I play my warrior, I will often stop taunting and will sometimes stop swinging <br/>
altogether in order to balance out the damage, and to keep the MOBs spinning.  <br/>
It&#39;s much easier for a party to copy with balanced damage, and a spinning MOB <br/>
attacks less, so both are useful.<br/>
