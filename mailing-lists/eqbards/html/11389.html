<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-133546832">I have a RL lvl 35 Rogue friend who acquired a Mudwater Rune recently. He can&#39;t recall offline if it&#39;s No Drop. I figure it is, being a quest item, but thought I&#39;d ask. He didn&#39;t reply when I asked him casually if he&#39;d get an Opoline Helm for me, too. *g*  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

p.s. If I get it, that will make one component of every lambent piece. Already have Shin items, Griffene Charm, both Runes of the One Eye, and the breastplate. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be nearly this far along yet, Harmonic not withstanding! So, if you&#39;re a young bard, what are you waiting for? Go for it!</div>
