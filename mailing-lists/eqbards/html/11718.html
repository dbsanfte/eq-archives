<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984574125">My regular group is going through an distressing time right now...<br/>
<br/>
The leader, who encouraged/dragged us through Blackburrow, Crushbone,<br/>
Chessboard, Unrest, and now Mistmoore gets bored very quickly.  He wants to<br/>
see the exp bar move & wants to go where he hasn&#39;t gone before.  There is<br/>
now doubt about the hi risk, hi reward thing.<br/>
<br/>
I just made 28, but most of the group is 33 - 36.  It seems like around 30<br/>
members get real shy about what they are willing to try.  I think we lost<br/>
our ranger last night, due to our leader wanting to move past the torture<br/>
room?  Not a game issue, but ya&#39;ll see the same thing?<br/>
