<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144997428">Actually I am more sick of hearing we won&#39;t get bind.  You are right it<br/>
won&#39;t happen until people start leaving EQ in droves because they are either<br/>
A, a melee class that is sick of running to their bodies on Kunark from<br/>
Freeport, or B, they are a caster who is sick of constantly dying because<br/>
all the tanks have either quit or are an hour away in Freeport because the<br/>
lizard race is evil and they can&#39;t bind there.  Verant needs to realize that<br/>
bind is not a class balance issue it is a game fun issue.  I frankly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t care if we got bind if either everyone could be bound everywhere by<br/>
a caster, and or there were npc&#39;s to bind you in cities.<br/>
<br/>
I have quit playing 5 times in the last 2 weeks because I found myself in a<br/>
city waiting for over an hour trying to get bound.  Adventuring on faydwyr<br/>
while bound in Freeport is pointless, as is adventuring on erud while bound<br/>
in Qeynos.  I have never been able to get bound on Erud unless I brought my<br/>
own binder with me.  I have sat in Kaladim for 2 hours waiting to get bound<br/>
after having been sent tells by three different casters in Butcherblock<br/>
saying hold on they would come bind me.  None of them showed and they are<br/>
all on my ignore list now.<br/>
<br/>
The only 3 places I have been able to bind in regularly are Freeport,<br/>
Qeynos, and Rivervale and even in those places its nigh on impossible after<br/>
11pm mst.  I hae been bound in Halas for over a week without being able to<br/>
get a bind after trying in Kaladim, Freeport and Rivervale.  last nite,<br/>
after 13 hours of play over the last  week I was able to get bound in<br/>
Rivervale.  For those of us who can&#39;t play in prime time and don&#39;t have a<br/>
regular group that gets online together on a consistent basis, binding is<br/>
currently a ridiculous situation.<br/>

We are not getting bind.  We will never get bind and we have less need for<br/>
bind than any other class, considering the rate at which we run.<br/>
Talies, please KABONG this before this whole arguement starts up yet again.<br/>
I think most people are sick of hearing it by now<br/>

This is a posting that was on alt.games.everquest that I think is <br/>
logical and something that may be considered for a petition.<br/>
Let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a suggestion for a bardic form of Bind Affinity. Bards are amongst<br/>
Norath&#39;s primary travellers, so it seems a little odd that, somewhere<br/>
amongst the song set, there is no bind song.<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to avoid the &quot;Give us bind&quot; syndrome, I have applied some<br/>
thought. If you are already thinking &quot;No way, bind for casters only&quot;, please<br/>
read on - you might actually be pleasantly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
The great Songmistress Alenia discovered a song, sung by a bard in South<br/>
Karana, which strangely and uniquely affected her. She aquired the<br/>
instructions for the singing of the song, and returned with it to Freeport,<br/>
thinking nothing further of it until her arrival.<br/>
<br/>
During her travel, she was accosted by a creature which, when she came to<br/>
loot it, produced a lump of ore. She placed this in her backpack, and<br/>
continued to freeport.<br/>
<br/>
The following morning, she dug out her notes, and decided to rehearse this<br/>
new song, before bringing it before her guildmaster for review. As she sang,<br/>
she noticed that the strange sensation she had experienced previously was<br/>
lacking, infact, she was most of the way through the song before that<br/>
sensation returned. Then the unexpected happened.<br/>
<br/>
The lump of ore, which she had not yet sold, began to resonate with the<br/>
chords and notes. Her mind was filled with a passion for the rocks and<br/>
stones, the earth and grass that had been hewn, cut, shaped and grown into<br/>
the town of Freeport. Her soul filled with a passion for Freeport, and she<br/>
realised she had bonded with Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling suddenly drained, she ceased the song and sat. She had discovered<br/>
it! She recognised the drained sensation from tales her mother had told her,<br/>
and with a clap of joy she cried out &quot;Mana!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
--- The practical explanation ---<br/>
<br/>
Bard&#39;s Bind would have a lengthy casting time instead of the usual &quot;3.0&quot;.<br/>
And it would use mana, and a component (a piece of ore, or maybe some other<br/>
item which would fuel a bit of economy).<br/>
<br/>
The mana would be, say, 200 units. However; bard&#39;s bind would ALSO be a<br/>
group effect, requiring, say, 100 or 150 units of mana per extra person<br/>
bound. During the bind, each of the targets must be seated.<br/>
<br/>
That means: Bard sings bind, 1 member of party (within radius) is not<br/>
sitting for the entire casting duration, bind fails.<br/>
<br/>
If the bard is grouped with, say, 4 people, he would need 200 + 4 x 100 =<br/>
600 units of mana.<br/>
<br/>
The numbers might need juggling so that a bard can bind a full party of 6 by<br/>
level 30.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that the song be implemented as level 20 or 21, and that the<br/>
songs be shuffled so that it effectively replaces the level 14 song (the<br/>
cataloging libretto).<br/>
<br/>
Implementing level 21 makes most sense, since you could then move Melanie&#39;s<br/>
Melifluous motion down to level 14.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t, however, think that we bards should get bind early (e.g. level 14).<br/>
I think prior to that point, making sure you can get bound is a good<br/>
encouragement for people to learn to *play* their character *as* a bard, to<br/>
socialise and such.<br/>

My Comments:<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I have to say that you really did think that out.  I like the fact that<br/>
you have couples the song with mana and with a reagent.  I go back and forth<br/>
with the group based bind.  One one hand, it would provide the melee classes<br/>
with a way to avoid a 5 zone run back to their body, on the other hand it<br/>
would probally cause an influx of people playing bards just to get that<br/>
ability.  On the plus side, the bard would be even more important to a<br/>
group.  I think by giving this abilitiy later in life, at say 21 as you say<br/>
is a great idea.  Its far enough in that the casual player wont play for 21<br/>
levels if they really dont like it. But not too far that its out of the<br/>
range of the committed bard.<br/>
<br/>
One addendum to that idea of yours, would be to put a singing restriction on<br/>
the bard bind similar or greater to the paladin lay of hands.<br/>
<br/>
If a restriction like that was put on it, I would have NO problem with it<br/>
being group based bind.  In addition you might make getting the song be a<br/>
hard involved quest that someone who is 21 could do solo, but would take a<br/>
lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
So, to summarize:<br/>
<br/>
Song: Bardic Binding Bellow<br/>
Level: 21<br/>
Casting Req&#39;s:  Mana, 200 (Self) + 100 Per group member, 800 Mana for full<br/>
group + Reagent (Enchanted electrum or something like that),<br/>
ore, etc. Possibly make a Zone Specific Reagent<br/>
<br/>
Stipulations: Can only be sung once per day, similar to Lay of Hands<br/>
Acquired: By multi-part quest, forcing the bard to travel to many zones<br/>
(thus preventing us from becoming Bind whores)<br/>
               Possible addendum to this.. make two spells.. the first being<br/>
               a Self-Only Bind that is bought at a merchant.  Still<br/>
               would use reagents, but would not have a casting restriction.<br/>
<br/>
               The Second Bind spell would be a Quest.  It would be group<br/>
               bind, but would difficult AND have a casting delay built in<br/>
               like lay of Hands, etc.  If you did it this way, you could<br/>
               even make the delay greater, say 2 days.  This would enable<br/>
the<br/>
               bard to be able to self-bind at any time, but only group bind<br/>
               on a limited basis.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is an excellent idea.</div>
