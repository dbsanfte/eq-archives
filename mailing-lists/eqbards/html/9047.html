<div id="ygrps-yiv-30563775">Yup, cleaning the trash makes the giants spawn alot more, clears out the<br/>
spaceholders.  As far as Genni is concerned, she&#39;s back on Sol Ro as well.<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel better, we killed a named Cyc on gornit&#39;s island this<br/>
weekend, took us about an hour and a half to kill him and all we got was a<br/>
Pearl necklace, and one died doing it.   He kept draining mana on all the<br/>
casters, very unhealthy...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what the necklace is?<br/>

&gt; Wow, thanks for the tip on clearing the &quot;trash&quot; mobs from the<br/>
&gt; hills here to get giants to spawn.  I made over 350pp there<br/>
&gt; tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>
&gt; soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>
&gt; my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>
&gt; or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>
&gt; to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>
&gt; sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>
&gt; died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>
&gt; was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>
&gt; drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>
&gt; both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>
&gt; range to heal me in time.<br/>
