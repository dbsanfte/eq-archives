<b>Subject:</b> High levels need to quit camping at the Kithicor zone points <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818919886">Kithicor is great now, but the high level people hunting there need to keep<br/>
the really bad stuff away from the zone points. (The server I was on last<br/>
night had 20 people camping at the zone, killing the things) Nothing like<br/>
zoning into a (Zlixx thul hits you for 137 damage) message. Even during the<br/>
day. Great when you are travelling. lol. I feel sorry for those lower than<br/>
level 15. IF you are going to hunt Kithicor, be courteous and do it far<br/>
enough away from the zone so that travelers do not get caught in fight.<br/>
