&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Some more questions<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh yea, a few more questions I came up with this weekend:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Should I be developing more than 1HS weapon skill?  (in terms of<br/>
&gt;weapons?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You should try and work all your weapon skills (1h Slash, 1h Blunt, Piercing <br/>
and Hand to hand).  Bards have high level weapons in all catagories (except <br/>
HTH). And my hand to hand skill came in handy this weekend, as I got to give <br/>
Lord Nafagen a knuckle sandwhich :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Has anyone tried to make a group of 6 bards doing that AOE song and just<br/>
&gt;walk around in a dungeon?  I&#39;m just curious how effective that group<br/>
&gt;would be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Grouping for other bards is a lot of fun, The most I have every grouped with <br/>
is 2 other bards.  The majority of our songs will not stack with themselves, <br/>
so it is more effective to have each bard sing different songs, this can be <br/>
very effective.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you guys do with all your practices (hmm maybe I should see<br/>
&gt;question 1)?  It seems most of our skills going up pretty well on their<br/>
&gt;own with  alittle priming...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good for trade skills, and for Instill Doubt.  ID goes up very slow till you <br/>
hit skill 50.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was using the Discord song to just kite fire beetles for real nice xp<br/>
&gt;at lvl 3, is this considered an abuse? (I actualyl try to never take<br/>
&gt;advantage of games &quot;flaws&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Congrats! I never managed to get the hang of kiting with CoD.  It is no more <br/>
abusive then any other form of kiting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Finally, thanks to all the bards who helped me this weekend!  You guys<br/>
&gt;(and gals) are the best!<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
