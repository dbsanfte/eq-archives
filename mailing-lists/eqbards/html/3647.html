<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785149325">Well, I have just subscribed to this mailing list and already I am enjoying it loads!<br/>
I just started a wood elf bard and am only 11th level (I usually play a 31st monk) and am on Bristlebane.<br/>
In response to Sylly (love the name btw) and his run-in with Gix in WC I have to say that blasted DE SK is one tough sumbitch.  I tangled with him playing my monk. My GOD! His Harm Touch didn&#39;t do too much -- maybe a 2 bubbles of damage or less, but when he started punching me for 30+ CONSISTENTLY I got a bit worried. He dropped me to around 75 hp&#39;s and I had to Feign Death to keep him from killing me. What a CROCK of poo!  Eventually, I got my health back and beat the snot out of him, but I had to get major buffed from a cleric and shaman.  SHEESH! You&#39;d think I was fighting Vox herself. (or those blasted Dire Wolves)<br/>

Me (15) and my Pallidin friend (22) attacked Kisdean Gix DEF in West<br/>
Commonlands. He conned green to my friend. I had a dirk and my friend had 2h<br/>
combine. Neither one of us hit for more than dmg 2  while Gix was laying<br/>
into us for 30 a round.  At 2 bubs, we ran to Befallen!  Whatever he is<br/>
wearing - it has ac like a full set of plate!! Also, he resisted my bellow.<br/>
Looks like it&#39;s gonna take some co-level casters in addition to some hvy<br/>
tanks to get him.<br/>
