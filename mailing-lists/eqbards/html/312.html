<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463824330"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to admit to Kiting but only for creatures that can only be hit with<br/>
magical weapons.<br/>
The reason is that I don&#39;t have a magic weapon.  Why would my character stand toe<br/>
to toe with a creature she can&#39;t touch with her weapon.  I think this tactic<br/>
makes sense from this point of view.  I must add that I don&#39;t tackle creatures<br/>
that are yellow or red using this method...</div>
