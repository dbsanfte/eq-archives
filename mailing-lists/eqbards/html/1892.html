 </span></blockquote>The problem with this (and I was doing it too) is that Chain just slows<br/>
the mob&#39;s movement speed from what I can tell, not it&#39;s attack speed<br/>
like Binding does. And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s movement speed<br/>
that much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob<br/>
from rushing back and forth to your casters and healers but other than<br/>
that it really doesn&#39;t seem that useful in the early phase of combat.<br/>
Later and for nailing down runners it&#39;s very effective though so I<br/>
always have it memorized. It can combine well with Screech to chase off<br/>
some mobs while keeping one slowly running away while you attack it but<br/>
this is only useful in limited situations (do not ever play fear in<br/>
lower guk for instance &lt;g&gt;) Now that it&#39;s working, I&#39;ve been using chant<br/>
of flame a bit to see how effective it is. As most of the powerful<br/>
L39-40 wizard spells are ice based it&#39;s not as useful as chant of cold<br/>
will be, but if you have a druid in the party it is nice. From what I<br/>
can tell from testing on myself it seems to do DoT of about 30 as well<br/>
as lowering fire resist significantly. I&#39;m hoping they fixed the L30<br/>
song soon so I can see how well that works.<br/>
