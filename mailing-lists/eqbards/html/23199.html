<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489623321">I would like some clarification on how our slow songs stack with<br/>
enchanter/shaman slows.  This past weekend I was grouped with an enchanter.<br/>
I had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until the enchanter<br/>
slowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late slowing the mob so<br/>
I went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>
enchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my Cessation song<br/>
wore off immediately followed by the message that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>
stuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before the song&#39;s<br/>
normal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>
overwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the enchanter slow spell<br/>
actually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message was an error<br/>
and his slow did not stick?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I am suprised no one else has noticed this yet, but over the weekend i<br/>
discovered (and had it confirmed and tested by another high level bard) that<br/>
the lvl 51 chains song no longer overwrites snare (we know it doesnt<br/>
overwrite root, but snare was a suprise)!  <br/>
<br/>
I also tested the chains song with the Enchanter Slow line, and the<br/>
enchanter slow overwrites the lvl51 song, but not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
What this boils down to (from my observations of the lvl 51 song):<br/>
<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to snare a mob if in doubt that it is snared<br/>
or rooted<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without fear of canceling<br/>
snare<br/>
*	We can now chain a mob to slow the mob, without the fear of blocking<br/>
an Enchanter slow<br/>
<br/>
What I have not tested:<br/>
<br/>
*	Other versions of our chains (the lvl 23 and lvl 54 aoe song) and<br/>
slow songs (lvl 21 aoe) against snare or slow<br/>
*	Any of the songs against the Shaman slow series<br/>
*	All of my snare tests were done against low-level druid snare.  I<br/>
did not test any of the songs against the higher level Ensnare.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been my understanding that our slowing effects stack with<br/>
Enchanter or Shaman slowing effects (but previous to the last patch would<br/>
block them if our song was up on the mob when the spell was cast).  If my<br/>
above testing proves to be true, this means that we are &quot;value added&quot; to<br/>
enchanters and shaman both now, at least from a mana and slowing standpoint!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing if you guys get similiar results!<br/>
