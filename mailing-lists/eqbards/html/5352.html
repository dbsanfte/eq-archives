<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008301345">Since the Glowing Stein quest was mentioned in a couple of posts today,  I<br/>
thought I would post this message that just came across the Brewers mailing<br/>
list.  This will save some of you spending time, and the severe faction hit,<br/>
it takes to complete this quest.  <br/>

&gt; As of Monday&#39;s patch on the Test Server, the Glowing Stein is no more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you possessed it, it is now a Stein of Moggok. It is now a 7/43 1<br/>
&gt; handed<br/>
&gt; blunt weapon, and can only be carried in the primary melee slot (right<br/>
&gt; hand).<br/>
&gt; If you already had it in the secondary melee slot (left hand), then it<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; stay there until you remove it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other than that, it is the same. MAGIC ITEM, and LORE ITEM. But it is NOT<br/>
&gt; nodrop.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;/end quote&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looks like any item farmed is gonna be changed.. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, stop wasting money on getting these things..<br/>
