<div id="ygrps-yiv-495124597">Before the experience loss was reduced I generally lost every level<br/>
I gained at least once from about 8th to 19th. If you lose your level<br/>
you simply can&#39;t memorize the song from your book until you<br/>
regain that level.<br/>

&gt; Have to say this is one of the best lists that I have ever been on.  Seems<br/>
&gt; to me that most people here are actually adults.  :)  Anyway,<br/>
&gt; enough patting<br/>
&gt; on the back, I have a quick question.  Just made level 16 last<br/>
&gt; night hunting<br/>
&gt; in Crushbone.  I got a few more kills for insurance sake and set<br/>
&gt; off to get<br/>
&gt; the Ayre.  Went to High Keep, got the song, scribed it, memorized it, and<br/>
&gt; went back to Faydwer.  My question is, what if I were to die<br/>
&gt; enough to lose<br/>
&gt; a level?  Would I lose the song completely, just not be able to<br/>
&gt; memorize it,<br/>
&gt; or what?  Haven&#39;t seen any discussion on this and was just wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone has experienced this yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are on Veeshan give me a tell and say hi.<br/>
