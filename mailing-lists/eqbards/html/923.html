<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054561935">Fennin Ro is still ONE of the most crowded servers, right up there with<br/>
Karana, Xegony and 1 or 2 more. It still is crowded because it is still a<br/>
big rp server. The newest server is Errolisi Marr I belive, and theres also<br/>
Rodcet Nife, but I think that ones a week older<br/>

&gt;Well, as I said before I haven&#39;t yet played in commercial. Now that I am<br/>
&gt;settled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially<br/>
&gt;those that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as<br/>
&gt;to what the best servers are to play on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right<br/>
&gt;about to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure<br/>
&gt;powergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep<br/>

&gt;powergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP<br/>
&gt;aspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even<br/>
&gt;more crowded than before. Any info on this will be much appreciated!<br/>
&gt;Especially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I<br/>
