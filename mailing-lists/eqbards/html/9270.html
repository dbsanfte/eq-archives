&gt; <br/>
&gt; this reminds me of what my friend did the other night to a newbie beggar, im<br/>
&gt; sorry but i cant stand beggars.  I can understand bugging guildmates or<br/>
&gt; friends for stuff but i would never go up to someone and start nagging for<br/>
&gt; stuff. So my friend got tired of being bugged by this newbie ranger, went to<br/>
&gt; the bank, got 13000 coppers and led the newbie far from the banker, gave him<br/>
&gt; all the coppers and then walked away, the newbie didnt know what to do, he<br/>
&gt; couldnt move and didnt know how to destroy it hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes life is good and generosity pays off<br/>
