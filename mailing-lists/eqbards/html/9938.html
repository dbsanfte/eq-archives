&gt; hell, if I can&#39;t even finish off two Orcs without losing half a bubble of<br/>

melee range.  Remember, you can try to charm them any time you<br/>
want, but you can&#39;t run away from them if Accelerando drops.  <br/>
I usually keep my drum equipped when doing this just for the<br/>
added safety margin.  (Technically, the magic number is 1.414x<br/>
normal running speed.  If you can exceed this speed, you can<br/>
make a 90 degree turn while they&#39;re chasing you and they still<br/>
won&#39;t be able to catch you.)  I&#39;ve switched to a lute to heal<br/>
up maybe 4 or 5 times, but 2 of those attempts have resulted<br/>
in me dying.  If you have to heal up, chances are you&#39;re just<br/>
a couple hits away from the point where you start moving<br/>
slower, and having a lute equipped then will result in your<br/>
death even with Accel.<br/>
<br/>
What I normally do is get them to chase me, run backwards (at<br/>
my level with a MM drum, I run much faster backwards than they<br/>
can run forward), and wait for a &quot;your feet move faster&quot;<br/>
message.  When I get that message I know Accel has just been<br/>
refreshed and I hit charm.  Regardless of whether or not the<br/>
charm works, I immediately start Accel again.  If the charm<br/>
worked, then I give the attack command (if needed).  If it<br/>
didn&#39;t work, I run away some more and Accel should refresh<br/>
before it drops.  There&#39;s enough time to charm twice before<br/>
you hit Accel again, but I found myself getting hit with that<br/>
&quot;your feet move faster/you slow down&quot; bug too often when<br/>
trying that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found /pet guard here to be more useful than /pet sit<br/>
down.  A pet that&#39;s sitting will get up and follow you if you<br/>
move too far away (or it decides on its own that it&#39;d rather<br/>
go somewhere else).  If you tell it to guard here, it&#39;ll stay<br/>
glued there giving you not just the duration of the charm to<br/>
get away, but the time it takes the mob to close the distance<br/>
with you.<br/>
