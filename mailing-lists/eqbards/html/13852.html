Ok so make the widgets lore so you can&#39;t really farm them (guess you<br/>
could get one for everyone in your group).  If you really want to be<br/>
cruel, make them no-camp...  I am opposed to forcing certain classes on<br/>
parties so I&#39;d make locked doors with extra prizes or put keys on mobs. <br/>
(who would then be needed if you dont have a rogue, but you could skip<br/>
them if you had one)<br/>
<br/>
NeverWinterNights (II?) looks great, but its more than a year away...  I<br/>
think its release will be the end of my EQ subscription...<br/>

&gt; Gold Box Construction set?  Is that the old Unlimited Adventures?  I had<br/>
&gt; similar &#39;modules&#39; using that and plan to continue the process on the new<br/>
&gt; Neverwinter Nights when it comes out end of the year.  An interactive<br/>
&gt; Baldur&#39;s gate with 100&#39;s of DM&#39;s out there creating virtual worlds.  Should<br/>
&gt; be fun.  Only problem I see with your solution is that you&#39;ll just end up<br/>
&gt; having groups camping each widget dropping mob all over the place.  Make the<br/>
&gt; widgets number around 12 and spread them out as random drops throughout the<br/>
&gt; 100 or so mobs spread thruout the zone and it might work.  Throw in a couple<br/>
&gt; of keys to use to get to the boss mobs area and even better.  Just remember<br/>
&gt; not to give the boss mobs LoS to the locked door so no one can make them<br/>
&gt; open it for them.  Better yet forget the keys, make them get a rogue or a<br/>
&gt; bard to pick the locks.<br/>
