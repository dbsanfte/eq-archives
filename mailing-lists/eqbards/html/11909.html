  ...after 3 ldcs show&#39;d up out of the blue last night and no<br/>
  enchanter to handle the situation.  That&#39;s all I could type<br/>
  after being pummelled for 400 dmg.  Really get&#39;s the pulse<br/>
  going...damn adrenaline.<br/>
<br/>
  Speaking of exciting, I got the chance to pull Sir Lucan <br/>
  last night.  About 12 people or so, all L45+ and they decide<br/>
  I should be the poor loser who pulls him.  (I&#39;ve never fought<br/>
  nor pulled him before, hell I had to actually track him to<br/>
  locate his spot.)  Wouldn&#39;t you know, one roaming guard, two<br/>
  posted guards, one Brother Gentry or something and Sir Lucan<br/>
  himself.  3 closed doors, 1 winding passageway to make an<br/>
  escape.  Yuck.  I had reso, words, symbol ~1900 hp.  Preparing<br/>
  to get the worst beating of my life, I ran in opened two of<br/>
  the doors, pulsed selo&#39;s, pixied lucan (just to get him pissy)<br/>
  and made a run for it.  The paladins in the group were joking <br/>
  about how they&#39;d watch me slowly lose hp and die.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
  No such luck for them.  I think Lucan&#39;s personal guard hit<br/>
  me once for 100, and Lucan himself hit me for double 75 -<br/>
  only after warping ontop of me.  I beat them out of the<br/>
  guard house so fast that they warped after I cleared<br/>
  the front gates (smooch smooch battle drums).  <br/>
<br/>
  During the Lucan fight, I tossed everything I had at the guy<br/>
  and right before the party wiped him out, I zoned out.  Was<br/>
  a pretty fun night, and I still can visit the bard guild in<br/>
  Freeport &lt;g&gt;<br/>
