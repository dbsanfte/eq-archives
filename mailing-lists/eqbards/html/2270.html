<div id="ygrps-yiv-790372731">There is a bard I grouped with, around level 17 or so.  She was decked in<br/>
full bronze, and just bellowed (I have bronze, but only the smaller pieces.<br/>
This is because, of course, I don&#39;t think the pants and chest are worth it.)<br/>
I asked her why she never used Anthem, and she told me &quot;bellow works better<br/>
for me.&quot;  Mmm, ok whatever.  Later, with her guildmates, we had to regroup<br/>
since the leader had left, and ended up individually taking on an undead.  I<br/>
received the experience, of course.  Impressed the ogre, higher level than<br/>
me with his deadly axe, that axe doing 60+ damage once when he got in two<br/>
great swings.  I told him to try and stress to his bardic guildmate how much<br/>
that song can help, but it&#39;s like talking to a wall.  With fast weapons and<br/>
Anthem or Whistling Warsong, I really can dish out the damage with the best<br/>
of them, but no one seems to realize it.  In my opinion, the way she plays,<br/>
using just Bellow and Accelerando, she should just be a ranger or warrior.<br/>
Being a bard requires a completely unique play style, and some folks just<br/>
don&#39;t have the hang of it.  If she&#39;s going to only bellow, she should trade<br/>
it in for a kick and bash!<br/>
