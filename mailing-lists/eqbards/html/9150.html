<div id="ygrps-yiv-387553375"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So what you are saying is that if you target a mob standing right next to<br/>
&gt;you and sing this song, you will also take damage.  What happens if you<br/>
&gt;target a mob from a distance but the rest of your party is standing near <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;mob? Will they also take damage?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;time)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm nope, like any damaging magic in the game (on the regular non-pvp <br/>
servers anyways) you cannot harm other players with it unless you are <br/>
dueling. So far i&#39;ve killed myself twice with this song - once because I <br/>
didn&#39;t know any better, the second time I was lagged to hell and the mob <br/>
warped next to me when it hit (ouch).<br/>
