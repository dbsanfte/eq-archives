&gt; sue me.  Now, if some company does it without my knowledge (IE:  Hacks my<br/>
&gt; system) then my company will sue them, not me.  But if I sign an agreement<br/>
&gt; letting a company scan the contents of my active memory and some sensitive<br/>
&gt; data happens to be in there then *I* am responsible and I can lose my job<br/>
&gt; and wind up in jail.  (not that it&#39;s likely, but it is possible).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, my company uses the internet, but doesn&#39;t do internet-based work, so this permutation didn&#39;t occur<br/>
to me.  1)  My company has more than enough internet security stuff on our network to prevent me from<br/>
running EQ altogether; 2) when we work on proprietary or secure data and/or systems, we do it on<br/>
stand-alone machines and transmit the information on cd-roms via courier; 3) for the same reason, I have a<br/>
stand-alone machine in my own home.  Plus, I never play EQ with any other processes running.  Yeah, I&#39;m a<br/>
dinosaur.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not *my* fault that some moron out there is hacking EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s problem.  The fact remains that they could scan my memory and<br/>
&gt; active tasks and just shut down EQ if it has whatever they&#39;re looking for.<br/>
&gt; If it doesn&#39;t I play as normal.  This way no data is being transmitted from<br/>
&gt; my computer that may be sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Verant is caught between a rock and a hard place here.  If they pull information up to their own<br/>
servers, they get hammered by the arguments you&#39;ve presented, but if they deny people access to a service<br/>
that they&#39;ve paid for without some form of proof, they get sued from the other side.  I&#39;m quite certain<br/>
that the reasons they wanted to pull the data up were to:  1) have proof if they chose to ban a player and<br/>
2) give them the ability to review the data to make sure that they weren&#39;t making a mistake.  Given the<br/>
number of clients they have, the number of machines that are running EQ at a given time, and a whole slew<br/>
of practical resource limits, I couldn&#39;t pulling much of anything up, and even if it contained something<br/>
that perhaps it shouldn&#39;t have, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
Since the point is moot, I&#39;m really just wrestling with the philosophical and technical implications<br/>
here.  I&#39;m not disagreeing with you, just trying to get a handle on this.<br/>
