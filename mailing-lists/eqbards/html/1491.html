<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484075433">Yes, I&#39;ve never done it either, though I admit I would have been tempted to<br/>
when I heard a friend howl complaints of someone a continent away.  Upon<br/>
reading your tale, it struck me: that troll should have just challenged a<br/>
member of your party to a duel, then felt self-righteous and superior when<br/>
no one was brave enough to take up the challenge.<br/>

&gt;Anyways, I am not guilty of ever doing this intentionally, however I am<br/>
&gt;guilty of wishing it upon people. However cheesy I think the saying may be,<br/>
&gt;Two Wrongs Do Not Make a Right. And you may find yourself on the receiving<br/>
&gt;end of an intentional mob train by your last victim some time in the<br/>

&gt;Just think twice before doing things like this. Not only is it possible to<br/>
&gt;be banned (of course it&#39;s easier to get proof of this when you get a<br/>
&gt;screenshot of the text a would-be mob-trainer sends as he is gloating over<br/>
&gt;your corpse), you also risk the other party trying to exact revenge.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes it fails (as in my case), but who knows when they will succeed?<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s no fun trying to have a good time playing a game while someone is<br/>
&gt;trying very hard to spoil it.<br/>
