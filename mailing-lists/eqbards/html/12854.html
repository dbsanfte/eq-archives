 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s not completely universal, nor do I think it was intended to be.  <br/>

  Those plain jane skeletons that roam around still stupidly attack<br/>
  me with my invis song on.  And while I have been able to browse<br/>
  around Unrest and a little of Befallen with clouding, I cannot do<br/>
  such in Lower Guk dead side.  <br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s also possible that even with invis up, things are scowling<br/>
  at you and they just happen to be green and/or non-agro.<br/>
