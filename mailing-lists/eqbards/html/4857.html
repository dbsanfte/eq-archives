<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167646164"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is<br/>
&gt;change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats<br/>
&gt;might be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem.<br/>
&gt;I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be<br/>
&gt;no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Right now there&#39;s a trade off for each, which is fine.  What I would like<br/>
to see though is Anthem returned to playable status, but the increases<br/>
adjusted accordingly.  Basically I&#39;d like to see it balanced to an<br/>
enchanters quickness series (quickness, alacritity, celerity, swift like<br/>
wind),  granted our songs can effect up to 6 people so there needs to be<br/>
some balancing, but the fact that a 35th bard cannot compete with the<br/>
speedup ability of a 24th enchanter is just silly.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No thanks, there&#39;s some skills that a player just has to have.  This is<br/>
akin to a caster knowing when he can cast in combat & not be interrupted, or<br/>
knowing how long to wait before casting so not to magetaunt a critter off a<br/>
fighter.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>
&gt;do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I haven&#39;t checked into this, but considering the skill is the same, I<br/>
would think it should carry over.  Actually I&#39;m still of the purist attitude<br/>
that you shouldn&#39;t know, what hide SHOULD do is be an equivilent of monk&#39;s<br/>
feign death, but have an extra restriction that you have to be out of LOS.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>
&gt;point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>
&gt;coin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Remove casters to bind anywhere, allow everyone to bind in taverns/inns,<br/>
provide an npc at inns that binds for 5p.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a<br/>
&gt;crossbow or bow?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   EQ&#39;s bards are quite different than any other RPG&#39;s bards.  Another pass<br/>
on throwing weapons might be in order though, recoverables is one thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be<br/>
&gt;used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>
&gt;singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas<br/>
&gt;here would help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   In theory they could be out there & just not found, there really are alot<br/>
of items that still havent been found.  In practice, given the way objects<br/>
have been structured it&#39;s quite doubtful you&#39;ll see this if not for a LONG<br/>
time.  I&#39;d just be happy for a plethora of magical instruments, not to<br/>
mention MORE good songs that are playable & not sung only.</div>
