<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266057897">Well all,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and seen many of your posts. One thing that i really<br/>
dont understand is why have a trade skill and then tweak it to make not<br/>
profitable anymore? i.e. selling goods to npc. By reducing profits this<br/>
narrows down what skills havea	viable profit. Jewelcraft and smithing come<br/>
to mind. So soon we will have a jillion smiths and jewelrers running<br/>
around. No offense to either trade but I decided to brew( know if I could<br/>
just quit drinking my goods:)) In my opionion these trade skills were put<br/>
in place for to offer a more realistic aspect to the game, I liked it:).<br/>
When u get tired of the hack and slash you can go back and have a drink or<br/>
make a necklace. I thought that a good approach to skills would being able<br/>
to combine known dropped lore items relating to your skill and enhance<br/>
somehow. Basically like a enchanter but not as good as enhancement. <br/>
<br/>
   Now pleze I am not trying to complain, I will still play either way and<br/>
try to have fun. I know many players that have not started a trade skill at<br/>
all and more power to them. I just dont get it? Why mess with the people<br/>
that have invested time in a skill?<br/>
