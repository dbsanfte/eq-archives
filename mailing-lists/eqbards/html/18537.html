<br/>
Anyhow, just throwing my 2 cents in on a lot of things because I read this<br/>
silly list on digest mode AND that little RoK thing has been keeping me<br/>
busy:<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Raids:<br/>
Elemental+Guardian.  On Nag I tend to get right under his tummy and punch<br/>
him in the junks for 10-15 or so.  This is by far the most fun I have in EQ<br/>
and where I&#39;ve got my most treasured screenshot:  You punch Lord Nagafen<br/>
for 8 points.  You have slain Lord Nagafen.  You recieve party experience. <br/>
Welcome to level 49!  In the loot window is my drum and orb. =)<br/>
<br/>
Vox has a much larger melee range and we (my guild) tends to spread out a<br/>
bit more in her lair, so I usually don&#39;t get to stand right under her and<br/>
have to move around quit a bit more.  I still melee with the ol&#39; wood elf<br/>
fists of might!<br/>
<br/>
On Mithril Vs Lambent:<br/>
Fashion is almost *everything* - the difference in stats is negliable in my<br/>
opinion as long as you have a good group backing you up.  Mithril is pretty<br/>
ugly and can&#39;t be properly accorized, go in a full suit or don&#39;t go at all.<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
My current Superman outfit is red dragon scale, rubi boots, elf hide<br/>
gloves, 2 orbs with the rest lambent.  I&#39;m going to try for Wolverine now<br/>
that there is a pair of claws that can be wore in the off hand... what helm<br/>
is black plate?<br/>
<br/>
On Singing Steel:<br/>
The effects are that bad, maybe its just how I play.  Having food and water<br/>
is nice, enduring breath is great for exploring too.  The AC is ridiculous<br/>
however.  Each peice could use a +2-3 point boost *minimum*.<br/>
<br/>
Uberguilds:<br/>
I hate the term but my guild (LoS, Legacy of Steel) gets accused of it too.<br/>
 We&#39;re small as things go, 50 real people but we can do anything in the<br/>
game at anytime and we always share our info, tactics and assistance once<br/>
we&#39;re confident its correct, so I tend to reject a lot of the critism that<br/>
is leveled against us by a very small very vocal segment of the server.<br/>
<br/>
On Loot:<br/>
We NEVER random, we NEVER do multiguild events.  Our GM (or officer if he<br/>
is not present) calls loot and that&#39;s that - we work so well together<br/>
because we&#39;re like a family.  Who ever gets the drops we all consider it to<br/>
have been worth it, that&#39;s just how we are.  In the rare pick up groups I<br/>
join (rare because we almost always are doing some sort of event) I simply<br/>
fore go loot because of all the difficulties and hard feelings that often<br/>
arise.<br/>
<br/>
On Weapons Vs Songs:<br/>
If we&#39;re in a situation that requires tactics and team work I almost always<br/>
opt for weapons, since our DoTs complicate mes.  I also go with weapons in<br/>
a &quot;normal&quot; group.  Other than that I tend to use the chants if (1) large<br/>
caster population benifits from debuffs (2) solo&#39;ing or (3) I have a mage<br/>
(and now rogue gaga! =D) about that I can harass for summoned daggers. =)<br/>
<br/>
On Kurnark Loot:<br/>
I HATE it not being NODROP most of all, but also I HATE soloable yard trash<br/>
at the zone line dropping stuff better than stuff my guild spend MONTHS<br/>
/played in planes for and I HATE the Monty Haul stats.  I had a really long<br/>
rant typed out but in the end I deleted because there&#39;s no need to subject<br/>
you all to it. =)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun all and sorry for the novel!<br/>
