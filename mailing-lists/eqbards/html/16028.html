still finding myself usually taking more hits than the real<br/>

&gt; &quot;welcome back to level 47, go solo some specs, have a nice day, please drive<br/>

Sylly, must keep up with Sylly.&quot;  :)<br/>

I tore through 48 in about 5 days despite a Fear trip and 2<br/>
Hate trips.  I spent a lot of time playing around with the<br/>
level 48 song and trying an all-instrument attack on various<br/>
mobs solo.  So I&#39;m a bubble and half into 49.  Rokenn seems to<br/>
have stalled like you did - he used to be ahead of me, but<br/>
he&#39;s still 47.  Once you get 48 back, you *have* to try<br/>
soloing or grouping with one tank and using nothing but your<br/>
lute.  Both of you should do even better since you have<br/>
7-string lutes.  20% bonus to heals + 20% bonus to DoTs = 44%<br/>
increase in effectiveness over my lute.<br/>
