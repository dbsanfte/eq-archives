the pull.  The range is somewhat limited (about the range<br/>
tracking group members goes screwy), but the more eyes the<br/>

our value relative to enchanters for speed buffs.  An<br/>

the fight.<br/>

clerics if we get a mess, so that they&#39;ll have someone to sing<br/>

&gt; Yk thinking that a) level difference what it is 47 vs 60 no matter what wep<br/>
&gt; I use, it wont hit for full effect; b) the Yk 75dd proc gets resisted all<br/>
&gt; the time but adds you to the hate list as if it hit for full effect. I guess<br/>

guildmember to spare him the camp), but in the planes, boy am<br/>
I glad I have a Wakizashi.  Even with a 6-note and Wak, I&#39;m<br/>
still finding myself usually taking more hits than the real<br/>
tanks (well, except the rogues :).<br/>

&gt; &quot;welcome back to level 47, go solo some specs, have a nice day, please drive<br/>

Sylly, must keep up with Sylly.&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
I tore through 48 in about 5 days despite a Fear trip and 2<br/>
Hate trips.  I spent a lot of time playing around with the<br/>
level 48 song and trying an all-instrument attack on various<br/>
mobs solo.  So I&#39;m a bubble and half into 49.  Rokenn seems to<br/>
have stalled like you did - he used to be ahead of me, but<br/>
he&#39;s still 47.  Once you get 48 back, you *have* to try<br/>
soloing or grouping with one tank and using nothing but your<br/>
lute.  Both of you should do even better since you have<br/>
7-string lutes.  20% bonus to heals + 20% bonus to DoTs = 44%<br/>
increase in effectiveness over my lute.<br/>
