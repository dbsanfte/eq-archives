&gt; Perceptually Selo&#39;s is about 30% slower for me (level 50,<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s drum) since the patch.<br/>

increase of 2.27x faster than normal running.  My previous<br/>
test at L45 had a 2.25x increase over normal running.  So<br/>
there&#39;s been no change (unless they slowed down normal running<br/>
speed).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still the possibility they tweaked the high end speed<br/>
cap.  Guess I&#39;ll just have to get myself a Selo&#39;s drum...<br/>
