<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958072913">Thanks a lot for the advice.. I asked mainly because I am unsure if keeping<br/>
the haste gloves are the most bang for the bucks considering the other gear<br/>
I have.. Furthermore I often feel that my damage output with weapons really<br/>
cant stack up with what I add to a group with my instruments. So improving<br/>
my own haste have never been _that_ important to me. Am I way off on the<br/>
feeling that improving haste isent a main issue for us bards?<br/>
<br/>
Things I considered trying to trade these gloves for are:<br/>
- Better weapons<br/>
- Better armor (singing steel BP *grin yeah right*)<br/>
- Better instruments??<br/>
<br/>
Well Im still in doubt what will be the most bang for my bucks *shrug* Its<br/>
the first time I have had an item this valuable...<br/>

&gt; allakhazam lists this item at 18K.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe 10K is more realistic.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FBSS is only haste and goes for 8K (average price)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This item has AC and +3 to **ALL** resists.  The<br/>
&gt; resists make it a great item for dragon raids.<br/>
&gt; (And for that reason you might want to just keep this<br/>
&gt; item...)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The item is rare at the moment and that may<br/>
&gt; artifically increase the price.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>
&gt; that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>
&gt; any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>
&gt; speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>
&gt; posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>
&gt; for that information.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>
&gt; song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>
