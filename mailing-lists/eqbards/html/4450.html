&gt; In Tallon Zek, the race war server, bards and enchanters will own when all<br/>
&gt; is said and done at lv 50, least until christmas&#39; expansion.  There are two<br/>
&gt; primary tactics that will prove deadly in pvp.  First, you can charm/make<br/>
&gt; them attack a high level mob, and then zone.  When you&#39;re wiped off of the<br/>
&gt; hatelist all that is left is your pet and the mob, and the mob will not stop<br/>
&gt; attacking the PC.  Second, there&#39;s the fear, chains combo, in which the PC<br/>
&gt; is entirely helpless as they walk slowly around the zone while you whack<br/>
&gt; them from behind.<br/>

multi-on-multi?  One of the problems I had with UO was that it<br/>
was always possible for a well organized group to insta-kill<br/>
someone in an ambush.  I don&#39;t see that as being any different<br/>
in EQ what with the higher level spells doing mega-damage.<br/>
