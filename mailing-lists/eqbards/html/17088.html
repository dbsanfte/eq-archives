<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390608934">We do not do much for downtime between 12th and 31st.  Before 12th I was<br/>
greatly appreciated for my downtime redux, since then no one mentions it.<br/>
Mana is the sole cause of our downtime at this point and I can do nothing to<br/>
alleviate that for another 9 levels.  By then the enchanter will have<br/>
clarity.  Maybe after 32nd I would be able to reduce downtime again, but it<br/>
already has not been the case for 10+ levels with another 9 to go.  Having a<br/>
primary that doesn&#39;t exist for 20 levels isn&#39;t much of a primary.  My groups<br/>
haven&#39;t had a hp downtime for at least 2 months.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise bards are not the group powerup many think they are.  If I take my<br/>
present group which has become very regular and I bow out, they see very<br/>
little change in the mobs they can handle.  If the cleric, the druid, the<br/>
ranger, the necro, or the enchanter leave, we see a huge reduction in what<br/>
we can take.  take out any of those 5 and we lose 50% or near to it.  take<br/>
me out and we lose maybe 10%.  With our full group we can take 2 infernos<br/>
and 2 flames gobs with little trouble.  take me out and they still can but<br/>
it might be close for the ranger and cleric.  take out anyone else and I<br/>
will die, guaranteed unless I run away, in which case everyone who doesn&#39;t<br/>
gate will die.  Fortunately I generally add considerable banter to the group<br/>
which is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
It was actually an offhand joking comment from one of these friends that has<br/>
led to my perhaps temporary exile and retirement to club med isle.  He<br/>
jokingly said after I ran back from the 4 death of the night.  &quot;Ha, back<br/>
from your back of the bus bind spot yet?&quot;  after spending over an hour doing<br/>
nothing but running across zones that night, I decided I couldn&#39;t take it<br/>
any more.  I looted my corpse and retired to club med isle to play my other<br/>
characters who aren&#39;t second class citizens.<br/>
<br/>
Stop working for the man!  Demand equality!  Don&#39;t let Verant&#39;s magocracy<br/>
determine where you can live and work!  Throw off your yoke of oppression!<br/>
Let the casters go without their meat shields for a time!  I&#39;m sick and<br/>
tired of Verant&#39;s insistance that it is acceptable to create a second-class<br/>
set of characters who are forced to spend much of their time running back to<br/>
their bodies every time they die.  The give the only escape spells to those<br/>
who need it least.  When our casters die, which is rarely, they have a 30<br/>
second jaunt back to playing again.  When the melee people die, its closer<br/>
to 20 minutes.  Running back to your body is not fun, period.  Its just<br/>
insult to injury after you are the only one to die, again.<br/>

would beat downtime.  And less people per server would help all classes.<br/>
Just about anyone would be welcome in a group were the ratio of mobs/players<br/>
better.<br/>
