&gt; anybody have it work for you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It didn&#39;t work for me either, especially after I gave a big promo for it:<br/>
&quot;Hey<br/>
everybody, watch THIS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also had problems with Selo&#39;s Accelerando...I was running with a friend in<br/>
my group and they didn&#39;t get the speed buff!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody spot any other bugged songs after the patch?</div>
