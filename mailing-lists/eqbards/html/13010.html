<div id="ygrps-yiv-951811448">It&#39;s interesting to note the various opinions people have of this song.  One <br/>
the one side, there are the bards who play nothing but this in combat - I <br/>
think the people on this list have expressed pretty clearly why this is <br/>
*usually* the sign of someone who doesn&#39;t understand how their other songs <br/>
work (obviously, in most cases our other songs are far more effective).  On <br/>
the other side, there are those who claim that, after hitting level 20, they <br/>
never use this song anymore, and more, look down upon those who do.<br/>
<br/>
Last night a group of my guildmates went frost giant hunting to get a mage <br/>
some toesies.  The group was 50 druid (puller), 47 mage (in search of <br/>
toesies), 37 cleric, 35 druid, 35 wizard, and of course the singin&#39; fool <br/>
with 37 more-or-less useful songs.  The mage whipped up a nasty pet, and <br/>
awayyyy we went.<br/>
<br/>
Now, short quiz: granted you&#39;re in a group with ONE primary tank (a pet) <br/>
that is not affected by your songs, and granted you have a target that&#39;s red <br/>
to you, what would YOU do?<br/>
<br/>
I wove Celerity, Bellow, Bellow.  Yup, that&#39;s right.  The druids and wiz <br/>
were playing pingpong with the giant (we avoided melee as much as we could - <br/>
those guys hit HARD), and I let the druid snare so we could stay out of <br/>
range as much as possible.  I tried Fufil&#39;s but got a resist every time due <br/>
to the dual-save.  I did run behind the giant, nipping at his heels with a <br/>
borrowed yaksucker (which, btw, apparently DOES proc at 37 - on two <br/>
occasions I got a message &quot;Your target has resisted the Ykesha spell&quot; and <br/>
never did I get the warning that I lacked the willpower to use that fine <br/>
weapon ´┐¢ maybe I just have a lot of willpower for my level? = ) ).  Celerity <br/>
helped me get in a few more hits on him, so it was *maybe* as good as Bellow <br/>
- maybe not.  Due to the pingponging, the giant was turning around a lot and <br/>
I had a hard time keeping him in range of my melee attacks - even snared, <br/>
they have long legs, y&#39;know?  We killed about 10 giants, I think... and in <br/>
that time I had 2 resists from Bellow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed for a long time that Bellow has a very low resist rate - heck, <br/>
I learned this as a teenager kiting red scythe beetles in North Karana.  I <br/>
was glad to see it still holds true 25 levels later.  My Bellows were <br/>
usually hitting for 14 to 19 points of damage, which is not too bad, all <br/>
things considered.  My group was doing everything they could to lower his <br/>
magic resistance, but it still wasn&#39;t enough for me to get Fufil&#39;s to stick. <br/>
  I didn&#39;t try Pixie Strike (wihch also lowers magic resist) because it has <br/>
the same dual-save problem Fufil&#39;s does.<br/>
<br/>
I am always open to suggestions - so what would YOU do in this case?<br/>
