 </span></blockquote>Your downtime macro is almost exactly the same as mine... hehe  I think the<br/>
only difference is that I don&#39;t put the emote in.  But I do have one hotkey<br/>
for situations that require it:<br/>
<br/>
/gs I AM PLAYING THE MANA SONG!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is my favorite macro...<br/>
<br/>
/assist TANKNAME<br/>
/con<br/>
/cast 7<br/>
<br/>
Very simple, very straight-forward, very handy.  7 is my battle buff<br/>
(currently Verses of Victory in a tank group)<br/>
<br/>
The assist line is at the top for easy changing the name of the tank to<br/>
assist...<br/>

&gt;Subject: Downtime Macro for mana/heal (was Re: Play the damn mana song (wa<br/>
&gt;s: RE: Prop...etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can someone send me there downtime macro for weaving Mana and healing? I<br/>
&gt;think I need to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

&gt;I am just catching up with the many emails of late.  Downtime macro I use:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
&gt;/pause 30, /cast 3<br/>
&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
&gt;/cast 4<br/>
&gt;/e sings a soothing tune<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I always stopsong at the beginning of my macro since most time I already<br/>
&gt;have a song up that needs stopping.  My pause 5 is time I need to recover<br/>
&gt;consistently.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cast 3 is either Cantana or HOR depending on group makeup(Cantana for<br/>
&gt;heavier caster group and HOR for heavier melee).  My pause 30 is for my<br/>
&gt;timing of casting time for buff icon to come up before next song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Stopsong again and pause to recover.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cast 4 is Chorus of Clarity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My emote is just let everyone I group with know what I am doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I leave Clarity song going for two pulses and hit the macro again.  If I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t pay attention or go afk for a sec, clarity continues to play = happy<br/>
&gt;casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In general, I use three macros during combat.  Based on my own experience<br/>
&gt;and knowledge gained from this list, they are only 2 line macros.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Each combat macro uses this base structure:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>
&gt;/cast x  (where x is the number of the song you want to cast).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I label them Fight 1, Fight 2 and Fight 3.  If I need a different song, I<br/>
&gt;either edit the macro to a different song already memmed or mem in the<br/>
&gt;right<br/>
&gt;song.  What does this do for you?  I only have to hit three keys to twist<br/>
&gt;instead of six(don&#39;t have to stop a song anymore).  I only use 2 line<br/>
&gt;macros<br/>
&gt;in case there is a problem and I need to do something else.  Macros can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;stopped(that I know of) so long macros can cause a problem.  (ie, you just<br/>
&gt;started a long macro, then big bad mob spawns on cleric, you want to charm<br/>
&gt;it, but ack! you can&#39;t due to the macro must run its course... you can see<br/>
&gt;the potential problem)<br/>
