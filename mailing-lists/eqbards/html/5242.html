<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lullaby interrupting casters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-306222520">Hey folks, I discovered last night that while Lullaby does not<br/>
interrupt the lizard casters in Cazic (debatable whether this<br/>
is a change to Lullaby in general, or lizards are just immune<br/>
or resistant due to shorter casting times), Pixie Strike<br/>
*does* interrupt them.<br/>
<br/>
It was great - we took down a herald and justicar and between<br/>
me using Pixie Strike and the two clerics using a stun spell,<br/>
they each got only one spell off during the entire fight (I<br/>
charmed them to pull them so they didn&#39;t get to cast while at<br/>
a distance either :-).  Boy do they go down easy when they<br/>
can&#39;t heal themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Another tactic I&#39;ve been using is if we&#39;re fighting a tough<br/>
mob (fanatic, zealot) and have done significant damage to it,<br/>
and a low level healing mob shows up (prosthelyte, page,<br/>
justicar), instead of everyone switching to the healing mob, I<br/>
drop out of the fight and Pixie Strike the healing mob over<br/>
and over.  That keeps it out of the fight and prevents it from<br/>
healing the tougher mob, and we don&#39;t have to let the<br/>
almost-dead tough mob beat on us while we try to take out the<br/>
healer first.  It doesn&#39;t work as well on higher level healing<br/>
mobs since they seem to break out of Strike too frequently<br/>
(and usually the first thing they do is heal).<br/>
<br/>
On another note, a herald hit machine-gunned me with four<br/>
consecutive wraths in about 10 seconds, dropping me from full<br/>
health to a bubble (I partly resisted the last one).  I had<br/>
bravery and symbol up so I went from over 800hp to under 200hp<br/>
in 10 seconds.  My cleric friends commented that they wished<br/>
they could cast wrath that quickly (the recycle time is much<br/>
much longer for players).  Did I mention I hate it when they<br/>
don&#39;t give monsters the same limitations that they give<br/>
players?<br/>
