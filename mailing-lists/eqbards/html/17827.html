<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098195768">I don&#39;t play on the Karana server anyway...but telling<br/>
people about a guild decision that will likely be<br/>
published on their website anyway is certainly not a<br/>
smear.<br/>
<br/>
But I would have to wonder:<br/>
<br/>
Are Shaman now prohibited from lottoing for stat<br/>
increasing items since they have spells for that?<br/>
<br/>
I think John makes a very good point that guildmembers<br/>
have a responsibility to look hard at whether an item<br/>
will benefit someone else more and forego the lotto if<br/>
their conscience dictates.  However, there are a lot<br/>
of gray areas here and I&#39;ll let NOBODY tell me what&#39;s<br/>
best for my bard...when a guild institutes a blanket<br/>
policy prohibiting an entire class from participating<br/>
in a lotto and none of the decisionmakers have played<br/>
a bard to lvl 50 -- then it&#39;s time to find new<br/>
playmates.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

&gt; with the speed cap, it makes sense for the top-notch<br/>

&gt; I think you should find a new guild, but make sure<br/>
&gt; any close friends you<br/>
&gt; have in the guild know why you&#39;re leaving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What server/guild is this anyway?<br/>
