<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096226151">This is the first time I have ever rabidly disagreed with you Michael.  Brad<br/>
has stated on numerous occassions that it is their concept of the game that<br/>
&quot;No single ability should play a major decision in a person&#39;s decision to<br/>
play a particular class or group thereof.  If it does it is unbalancing and<br/>
needs to be changed.&quot;  This has been stated by Brad and Smed in several<br/>
places in several ways and yet they don&#39;t seem to understand that many<br/>
people are choosing not to play non-binding classes under just that<br/>
circumstance.  Our group has lost 3 tanks in the last month and a half.  All<br/>
have quit playing their tank, 22nd ranger, 23 warrior, and 20th Paladin, in<br/>
order to start from scratch and be able to bind/gate.  I am now the #2 tank<br/>
in the group behind our monk.  None of these people has any desire to go<br/>
back to their old character because binding is too much of an advantage to<br/>
give up.  Verant is stubbornly sticking to a policy that violates their own<br/>
stated rule regarding class balance.  If they hadn&#39;t started to waver and<br/>
has kept binding the same for all classes, we might not even be having this<br/>
discussion now.<br/>

The last straw by the way was when our Paladin died 5 times trying to get<br/>
back to Guk.  Twice by sand Giants, 1 by Spectres, 2 by Troll Guards trained<br/>
to the zone area.  He lost more exp than he would have under the old system<br/>
had he appeared outside Guk where the cleric was bound.  Not to mention the<br/>
2.5 hours he spent running across zones and looting all his backup equipment<br/>
3 times off his corpses.  He has played his Paladin since.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It would be a bitch to get bound, but it would be possible.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>exactly, way too much of a pain and way too complex.  there are and must be<br/>
penalties to dying: loss of experience and returning to bind point.  a<br/>
couple months into final release, there was a decision made to reduce<br/>
drastically the amount of experience loss when dying, but keeping the<br/>
binding policy in place.  i would vote for this any day of the week, and i<br/>
assume it was this or change the binding policy and keep the experience loss<br/>
the same.  above level 30 every death was approximately TWO BUBBLES of<br/>
experience.  i lose about 25% of that now, and trust me that has saved me a<br/>
hell of a lot more time just running back to my group instead of having to<br/>
rebuild that experience.  anyway, i can not foresee changing my view on<br/>
binding.  and my two highest level characters can not bind.  the only<br/>
trouble i ever had getting bound was in the first week when no one could<br/>
(hehe my friend was the first person on our server to reach level 12 who<br/>
could bind which was cool).  it is a pain to die, as it should be.  no one<br/>
likes it.  the ability to bind is reserved by a few classes, and it is part<br/>
of the choice on what class you want to play.<br/>
