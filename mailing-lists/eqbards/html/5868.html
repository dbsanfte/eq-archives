&gt;icon blink just before they saw me and attacked. I know the Elites <br/>
&gt;and some of the high level Gobs can see me but the wizards, <br/>
&gt;mendicants, priests , so-called common spawn cant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not how it works.  Level is not the basis on which a monster<br/>
will see you.  In Permafrost, priest-types which include:  preacher,<br/>
prelate, priests, mendicants MAY have the ability to see invis. <br/>
<br/>
Regular ice goblins and burn caster types do not typically see invis.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very easy to figure out, if in doubt con them:<br/>
<br/>
You will get an indifferent message if the monster cannot see you.<br/>
Otherwise, you will get your normal scowls message.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only had one evoker see me while invis, and that&#39;s because<br/>
his prelate buddy beside him had him buffed to the max.<br/>
<br/>
The ice giant diplomat sees invis if you were wondering =)<br/>
