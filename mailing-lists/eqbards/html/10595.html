<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084630854">i read on eqcasters.com (well, somewhere) that it is not limitless, but it<br/>
is about 3 times normal.  if the NPC is not engaged in combat, it is<br/>
limitless.  the reason being someone could cancel magic repeatedly on an NPC<br/>
(does not aggro it) so that it constantly is rebuffing itself, thus running<br/>
out of mana.  but in combat, it is only 3 times normal and thus seems<br/>
limitless.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; First, it&#39;s not seemingly - it *is* limitless mana.  A guide <br/>
&gt; friend of mine <br/>
&gt; confirmed that one...<br/>
&gt; And a few additions to your list:<br/>
&gt; Can cast while moving, Can open locked doors, can see through <br/>
&gt; walls, can <br/>
&gt; attack from the bottom of the ocean, don&#39;t drown - ever, can <br/>
&gt; chase you even <br/>
&gt; when blinded....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And the list goes on....<br/>
