<div id="ygrps-yiv-585644472"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Several points... bards are mob magnets... usually at the worst possible<br/>
&gt;time. =)  Fighters, even with same type of armor, seem to be able to handle<br/>
&gt;dmg better than bards.  And I don&#39;t know about others, but my ability to<br/>
&gt;deal out damage really sucks.  I hit about 60% of the time, and maximum<br/>
&gt;damage with my current weapons (barbed whip and combine LS) is 42 per <br/>
&gt;round,<br/>
&gt;plus bellow for an additional 17 for a total dmg of 59.  Compare this to a<br/>
&gt;caster who can do 300+ with a single spell, or a rogue who can do 80+ with<br/>
&gt;backstab, or a fighter with a good 2h weapon who can do 70+ with weapon<br/>
&gt;alone, plus kick, bash, riposte, etc. And don&#39;t forget rogues and monks<br/>
&gt;disarming their opponents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, bards are, strictly speaking, a luxury item, not a necessity in <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;group.  Every group needs tanks and healers.  After that they need nukers.<br/>
&gt;What we do is make everyone else more effective.  We minimize downtime by<br/>
&gt;topping off the hurt with our heal song, bringing casters back into action<br/>
&gt;faster with mana song, make the tanks deal out more damage with anthem,<br/>
&gt;protect with the guardian series, etc.<br/>
&gt;But strictly speaking, we are not truly &quot;needed&quot;, not the way a healer is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You want to show a group how important a bard can be? Go join a group <br/>
&gt;that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;camping Drez or any charm-using mob, and do nothing but stack Guardian and<br/>
&gt;Elemental.  That ups everyone&#39;s magic resist to 80 or better.  No one gets<br/>
&gt;charmed anymore. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or a Tae room group with 2 pallys, cleric, druid, wiz, and a mana bard.  I<br/>
&gt;did a group like that the other night and we did a 20 minute non-stop <br/>
&gt;melee.<br/>
&gt;No one died, no one was ever totally OOM.  I&#39;d step back and hit mana song<br/>
&gt;to recharge the caster and healers, then back into melee and do anthem some<br/>
&gt;more.  We piled the bodies high around us that night. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I suspect it&#39;s just powergamers not wanting a jack-of-all-trades, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt;characters who can do the most damage standing behind those who can take<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;most beating.   Ah well, one day I&#39;ll be level 50 too.  And know what?  <br/>
&gt;So<br/>
&gt; &gt;will those guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;m finding is that it&#39;s people who were in early beta phases, and <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;want to be with their old friends more than being with new friends. Their<br/>
&gt;old friends know the mobs, know how to stay on top of the spawn.  Newer<br/>
&gt;friends take time to learn this, and in bad situations, that time might<br/>
&gt;spell someones death.  They&#39;ll take a 33 shaman instead of a 33 bard <br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;that shaman goes back to P0.5, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But once you become known as someone who is *GOOD*, you can break down <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt;walls.  It just takes so awfully long to do that most give up.  I&#39;m too<br/>
&gt;damned obstinate to quit. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um - yeh, no way can a bard stack up to a similar-level warrior in melee <br/>
potential. They get the most hp, and they get dual-wield, double-attack, <br/>
parry, riposte, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Back in p4, before they `ripped&#39; out the bard speed-attack combo (whistling <br/>
warsong/anthem stacked), I was able to beat a friend of mine in melee one on <br/>
one. He was a ranger, we were both 10th level. He didn&#39;t have all the cool <br/>
skills fighters get so it was just a match with our mino axes. &quot;damn songs!&quot; <br/>
was all i kept hearing. Well, now that speed-attack combo is out, there is <br/>
definitely no way I could duel him at most likely any level.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the bard not being a necessity for parties, but I would hate to <br/>
be without one were I not playing one =)<br/>
