<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038033571">If you see the minotaur hero, don&#39;t expect the guards to stop him, he eats<br/>
them for breakfast.  However I think he is camped alot these days, so not a<br/>
threat.  Back in my heydey of Steamfont he would run rampant through the<br/>
zone, slaughtering newbies till about 5 guards would gang up and take him<br/>
down...</div>
