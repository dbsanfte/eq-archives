there), so we were all in South Ro.  No wisps there, so I<br/>
dueled the guy with the RBB.  I sure as h*ll wasn&#39;t about to<br/>
let him beat on me with a Mistwalker and Dragonspine Claw, and<br/>
I wanted a weapon with a large delay so I could get a more<br/>
accurate timing with fewer swings.  Someone happened to have a<br/>
scythe around, so that&#39;s what we used.<br/>
<br/>
I should be getting timings for Sunderfury and Monsoon (both<br/>
warrior haste weapons) soon.<br/>
