&gt; is if there is a<br/>

&gt; and doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; pass on his possessions.  These are not sufficient.<br/>

I agree.  Once a fairly decent item enters the game, there is little to no<br/>
chance of it ever &quot;leaving&quot; the world.  There needs to be an infinite money<br/>
and/or equipment &quot;sink&quot; added to this game.  I would love to see a &quot;item<br/>
degredation&quot; system implemented.  The majority of gripes will come from the<br/>
melee classes - who rely almost exclusively on their equipment.  It would<br/>
almost be a requirement to learn the skill that allowed a character to<br/>
repair damaged items.  The other big gripe would be, &quot;I spend X amount of<br/>
time looking for a bind, now I have to look for someone to repair my<br/>
equipment as well?&quot;.  A lot of people would whine about a change like this -<br/>
I would love to see it though.  What about allowing a MOB who kills you, to<br/>
loot one item from your inventory (and then it&#39;s gone forever)?  Actually,<br/>
that might be way too drastic (I&#39;ve already died 8 times this level :p )<br/>
