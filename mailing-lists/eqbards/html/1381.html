<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647724892">I have my first two slots as melee weapons, the next is a blank, and the<br/>
next three are instruments.  I have the next bank set up for the first 6<br/>
song slots, and the next bank for miscellaneous skills.  Thusly I seldom use<br/>
foraging anymore.  <br/>

The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me wondering<br/>
how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>
only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>
banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>
buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>
can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed so<br/>
I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>
for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>
two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>
worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>
continually click on it in between combats.    <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>
mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank but<br/>
don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>
<br/>
How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>
