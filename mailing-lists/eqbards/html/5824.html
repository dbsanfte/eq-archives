I have almost lived in Unrest from levels 14-24.  Yes this place can be<br/>
exciting, but it can be quite tedious at times.  As bard there are<br/>
actually very few items that you will really want in here.  Mostly the BS<br/>
mantl and BS Tunic unless you are a wood elf, then small bronze looks<br/>
quite attractive.   After many successful and unsuccessful campaigns in<br/>
Unrest I have found  that the following group make up provides the<br/>
greatest balance while holding a room.<br/>
<br/>
I find that <br/>
2 tanks (warrior, monk, ranger, paladin, shadowknight)<br/>
1 bard <br/>
2 cleric<br/>
1 DD caster<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I get a group like this holding a room like the Ghoul Magi room,<br/>
Hand room or the Barrom is quite easy.  Once you get your level 23 things<br/>
get better because you are able to stop the runners if you have no ranger<br/>
or Druid.  Hope you have fun in there =).<br/>

&gt; Went up to Unrest 2 days ago.  My first time and all I gotta say is: WOW!<br/>
&gt; After hours and hours of slow camps in HighKeep and elsewhere, this place is<br/>
&gt; crazy!  Our group was 16 to 22 in levs - ya 16 is pretty rough for what we<br/>
&gt; were doing - stand at the wall and pull from the back and side doors.  But<br/>
&gt; hey - he was gittin xp off the death beetles that inevitably join any fight.<br/>
&gt; And we wanted ghouls and dry bone skels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You NEED combat healers to do any good in here.  You also need to RUN when<br/>
&gt; you get overwhelmed by a bad pull or some body else&#39;s train.  And you need<br/>
&gt; to chill about trains.  This place is Grand Central Station.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got a bub of xp with an inexperienced - not so well balanced group last<br/>
&gt; night and it was exciting as anything I have seen since BlackBurrow Paw when<br/>
&gt; I was younger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ya, I&#39;m hooked!  See ya in Unrest!<br/>
