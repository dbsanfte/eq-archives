<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050881786">Something I&#39;ve noticed in a great many zones (I love to travel and we do it<br/>
very fast, very early) is that there are a great many creature types that don&#39;t<br/>
seem to like music.. Perhaps they just don&#39;t appreciate its gentle rythm and<br/>
cadence, but I happened upon a document in Everfrost the other day about a<br/>
named skeleton called &#39;vengeful lyric&#39;.. Someone who was looking for Karg<br/>
Icebear out near the entrance to Permafrost said that he had just seen this<br/>
skel take off like a shot.. I didn&#39;t think anything about it at the time, but I<br/>
had just started playing Selo&#39;s at the entrance to Halas..<br/>
<br/>
Within mere seconds this mob was all over me.. he was way too big for me to<br/>
kill (yet)..  But I firmly believe that there are creatures that DO NOT like<br/>
bards instinctively.. as a list the following creatures dislike my bard more<br/>
than they dislike my Warrior (same level, race and have killed the same<br/>
creatures)<br/>
<br/>
beetles (all)<br/>
undead (greater and magic hit only it seems)<br/>
griffons<br/>
evil eyes<br/>
plague rats<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.. Still need to look into others, but I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>
&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was a<br/>
&gt; bit of a surprise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>
&gt; rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every greater,<br/>
&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>
&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker - thankfully, I am the<br/>
&gt; only one that died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of NOWHERE - why<br/>
&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>
&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less long) and<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>
