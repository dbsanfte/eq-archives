&gt; Am I doing something wrong?  I have only been singing the Psalm of Warmth.<br/>
&gt; I was under the assumption that using an instrument gave you the infravision<br/>
&gt; bonus.  Do you have to equip an instrument to get the damage shield, i.e.<br/>
&gt; singing it only gives you the resist bonus?<br/>

they are singing based - there is no instrument associated<br/>
with them.  You can get the full resist bonus while using your<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
As someone else already said, you only get the message when<br/>
*you* are hit.  If someone else gets hit, you only see the<br/>
&quot;burned&quot; message.  And the message for Psalm of Cooling is<br/>
&quot;chilled to the bone.&quot;<br/>
