<div id="ygrps-yiv-198072439">you don&#39;t need to charm, just use sneak.  ranger with my used harmony, i<br/>
snuck behind him and gave him the note.  the doppelganger attacked and the<br/>
regular guy didn&#39;t move =)  if no harmony then sneak still works but they<br/>
will both attack.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; note that the head you want is off the doppleganger that <br/>
&gt; spawns after you<br/>
&gt; give him the note.  we actually root/atoned marigal and <br/>
&gt; pulled his doppleganger<br/>
&gt; away to kill him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and we used that charm thing to give him the note.  he will <br/>
&gt; break charm as soon<br/>
&gt; as you give him the note and the doppleganger will spawn, so be ready. </span></blockquote></div>
