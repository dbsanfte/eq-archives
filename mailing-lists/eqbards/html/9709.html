<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569966509">Actually I have been hunting parts for lambent armor since it where added.<br/>
Until now I have:<br/>
1 lambent stone, bought for 30pp.<br/>
1 Shin greavers<br/>
1 Shin gauntlets<br/>
I looted the shin stuff in LGuk with help of some of my higher level<br/>
friends/guild, but I would not think that it would be to hard to get them by<br/>
just going there and waiting. Got the gaunts from another person who did a<br/>
/shout Gaunts to loot at entrance.<br/>
<br/>
1 Dark bracelet (sp?)<br/>
The Dark bracelet was aquired during my normal fighting in Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I am trying to get the Icy greavers, but my main problem is that no<br/>
one on Bertox seems to hunt in Perma during my normal playing hours (evenings<br/>
CET around 8-12PST), but getting to king room is not a problem if someone is<br/>
keeping the area around the first gate clear. Anyone else notice that invisio<br/>
seems to fail EVERY time you get near it (Atleast it did when I was 23 havent<br/>
tried at 24 yet)?<br/>
Well I was in one group who camped the king room for some time and it was not<br/>
tough to hold for a group of level 23-30 or so people with the right pulling<br/>
strategi.<br/>
When I get the icy&#39;s I will be of to MM again to try and get the gloves and<br/>
lute. Or maybe the karanas to get a griffene charm.<br/>
So dont give up. You can get the stuff with a bit of help. Just give yourself<br/>
time to get to know the zones where the items is - and how to get there.<br/>
Using your invisio song you can go far in on your own to get the loot.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

I&#39;ve been trying to get my Lambent armor but had no luck. Sunday I tried<br/>
Perma, but I was seen by a mob whilst invis, ran and took a wrong turn and<br/>
ended up dieing, when I got back in the zone somone was shouting Icy<br/>
greaves, anyone want them, I shouted &quot;ME&quot; and he replied come to the king<br/>
room. Well I knew the king room was hard but I&#39;d never been in Perma so<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to get there, and that loot went to waste because no one<br/>
would show me the way there.<br/>
I went to Solusek A last night and everyone told me I&#39;d find it hard to get<br/>
to the Solusek Champ or Mage without a group of 6 level 30+&#39;s so I gave up<br/>
that idea.<br/>
I yet to go to Cazic or Guk but I will go when I hit level 28 (Staff of<br/>
Writhing Proc).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on Veeshan want to help me in my cause??<br/>

PS I&#39;ve got a Lambent Fire Opal, just need Icy Greaves and Shin Greaves.<br/>

I got a Lambent Stone yesterday for 30PP.  His original auction was for<br/>
100PP.  All you have to do is put them in thier place. =)  It also helps if<br/>
you&#39;re the only Bard in the zone.  I may take your suggestions and head to<br/>
Perma and Guk and see if I can get some looting rights =).<br/>

&gt;I got lambert greves at 23.  Use your invise song and hit guk and perma to<br/>
&gt;get shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>
&gt;both dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>
&gt;lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and<br/>
