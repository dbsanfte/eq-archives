<div id="ygrps-yiv-232135152">Allow me to state a few facts that should be obvious.<br/>
<br/>
1) Not all randoms were created equal. What I mean is that I&#39;m sure that<br/>
some spawns are pure random between several items on an encounter table.<br/>
(eg. newbie areas, a spawn has an equal shot of getting a bug, a bat, a<br/>
snake, etc.) However, for the named spawns, I&#39;m equally sure that the named<br/>
has a lower chance of spawning than the place holder. They have to do it<br/>
that way to limit the entry of items into the game. The way the game<br/>
probably works is that it grabs a random number from the generator and then<br/>
performs additional calculations before arriving at the final number which<br/>
it uses to check to see what is spawned. This makes it much harder to<br/>
determine the true randomness of the generator. The only instance I can find<br/>
where there would be no additional processing would be with the /random<br/>
command. And my experience has shown it to be fairly random. If you were<br/>
truly curious, I would advise that you take a large sample set of data with<br/>
the /random command and analyze that data. But trying to extrapolate<br/>
randomness from spawn tables and loot drops is somewhat pointless. There are<br/>
other steps we are unaware of that will not be taken into account.<br/>
<br/>
2) Often times, statistics are skewed by observations. For example, missed<br/>
notes. I happen so see single instances of missed notes from time to time.<br/>
However, I&#39;m less likely to remember them, because they are not nearly as<br/>
frustrating as seeing TWO missed notes in a row. Evidence that you are<br/>
probably not remembering them is that you often see just 1 proc. If the<br/>
random generator were truly broken as you say, you&#39;d always see doubles of<br/>
missed notes AND procs, but not one or the other.<br/>
<br/>
3) Lastly, take into acount that this should be a pure random. Therefore,<br/>
events that have already occured have no bearing on events that are about to<br/>
take place. If I&#39;m in the lord room, and he hasn&#39;t spawned in 6 hours, that<br/>
does not make him any more likely to spawn the next time. The chance to<br/>
spawn is always the same.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m no statisitcal genius. I leave that to John Kim.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your comments on Random Number Generators - however -<br/>
criticizing my comments - I wonder how long you&#39;ve played Everquest &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
Their RNG is CLEARLY flawed.  In particular - I use SSOY in the Lord Room as<br/>
an Example.  I know MANY people who have LITERALLY camped it for two weeks<br/>
in a row maybe a total of let&#39;s say 50 hours.  They report going days and<br/>
days of never seeing one - and then getting five in one session.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
of this happening on several occasions.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is Proc&#39;s and Failed Notes.  I almost never see just one or<br/>
three in a row.  I&#39;d say that about 85 percent of the time - I get two procs<br/>
or two failed notes in a row.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve EVER seen three procs in<br/>
a row.  I RARELY have seen three missed notes in a row (discounting when low<br/>
instrument skills is a factor).<br/>
<br/>
To &quot;Perhaps a Princess&quot; this is not Random according to the &quot;Experts&quot; in the<br/>
articles I&#39;ve read. The issue of extrapolating on a small sample aside<br/>
(which again I grant is true in my test on Kaesora but not my example of<br/>
procs/missed notes) A RNG should produce a truly random sample.  For a<br/>
Binary test.  Consistently getting 45-50 0&#39;s followed by 2 1&#39;s 85 percent of<br/>
the time is bad code.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - perhaps this is all a part of &quot;The Vision&quot; and they<br/>
specifically coded the RNG to work that way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know a lot about a Statistics - but I&#39;ve been in the IT industry for<br/>
16 years and read lots of articles about Random Number Generators for<br/>
computing systems.  There are tests that can be done on the algorithm as to<br/>
how Pseudo-Random they are (obviously - by definition - an algorithm can&#39;t<br/>
be truly random)  I&#39;d be curious if Verant has done this analysis.<br/>
<br/>
This is evidence of poorly coded random number generator.  The Prosecutions<br/>
rests.<br/>

umm, do you know what &#39;&#39;random&#39;&#39; means?  and have you taken any statistics<br/>
courses?<br/>
do you honestly think that a sample size of 7 is statistically significant<br/>
for a typical<br/>
random number generator?<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s an example.  a pair of dice has 36 possible combinations.  roll the<br/>
dice 7 times.<br/>
even assuming you don&#39;t duplicate any of those combinations during those 7<br/>
rolls, that<br/>
means you haven&#39;t rolled 29 of those combinations.  by the stats you&#39;ve<br/>
accumulated<br/>
they have a 0% chance of occurring.  obviously false.  and that&#39;s only 36<br/>
combinations.<br/>
