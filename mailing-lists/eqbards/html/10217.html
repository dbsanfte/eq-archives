&gt; &gt; equipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bunch of people who like to play the monty-haul-start-off-<br/>
&gt; &gt; with-the-best-of-everything game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, let me ask you this then: Suppose someone I know (a college student)<br/>
&gt; has a fancy car that was given to him by his well to do parents. Now I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; own a car like this but would like to, and could certainly do so, if I so<br/>
&gt; choose, because I&#39;ve already gone to college and have a career making a very<br/>
&gt; nice salary (i.e. &quot;paid my dues&quot;). SO...If we take this line of thinking<br/>
&gt; then it would be fair or kind for me to say he doesn&#39;t deserve the car<br/>
&gt; because he didn&#39;t earn it, and so SHOULDN&#39;T have it??? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
&gt; (just a little playing the D Advocate here)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m speaking in universal generalities.  One student having a<br/>
car given to him by his parents is pretty irrelevant.  OTOH,<br/>
if 80% of the students at a college have expensive cars given<br/>
to them by their parents, then that may be a factor in your<br/>
decision to (not) attend that college.  It alters the living<br/>
(playing) environment, to the dislike of some and to the like<br/>
of others.<br/>
<br/>
Given the half-hearted attempts Verant has made to thwart<br/>
twinking, they&#39;ve legitimized the viewpoint that you SHOULDN&#39;T<br/>
have expensive cars given to you by well-to-do parents in this<br/>
game.  I don&#39;t have a problem with people who want to twink.  <br/>
I do have a problem with them wanting to do it in a game where<br/>
the designers don&#39;t want them to twink.  IMHO the ideal<br/>
solution given infinite resources would be to have some<br/>
servers a twink-fest, and others twink-free, to support both<br/>
ends of the spectrum.<br/>

&gt; regardless of the issue at hand (sometimes I have to remind myself of that).<br/>
&gt; What people seem to be objecting to, IMO, is how mean-sounding it was for<br/>
&gt; that person to say &quot;... you don&#39;t deserve....&quot; etc (and I know that person<br/>
&gt; probably didn&#39;t mean it to come across as harsh as it sounded???). BUT,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, if there is nothing in the game that you don&#39;t deserve,<br/>
then there is no advancement, and you have the ultimate<br/>
monty-haul game.  It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>
something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>
of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>
advancement-based RPG.<br/>
