 </span></blockquote>not necessarily, because druids and necros are much easier to play and have the<br/>
perception of being great soloers, whereas bards are hard to play, appear to be weak<br/>
if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, and have the perception of being overly reliant<br/>
on a group.  also there&#39;s that 15-22 gap where you really don&#39;t get much in the way<br/>
of songs and other melee classes are getting defensive and offensive skills where<br/>
most people give up being a bard.  plus a lot of people playing the game want to have<br/>
a clear effect, i.e. my spell did XXX damage, my heal healed XXX damage, which is the<br/>
type of feedback bards rarely get.</div>
