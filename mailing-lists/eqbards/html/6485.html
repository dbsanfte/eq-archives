<div id="ygrps-yiv-489403562">Ya it is interesting seeing it from the otherside.  Over the weekend I was <br/>
playing my secondary character (a lvl 15th Necro) and had the chance to <br/>
group with a 16th bard, it was great!  And a lot of fun. If you run in to <br/>
Inka (the bard I grouped with) on the Karana server give him a /wave :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;I think it&#39;s a compliment to the subscribers of this lists that there are<br/>
&gt;&gt;relatively few Bards.  WE all know how absolutely wonderful it is being a<br/>
&gt;&gt;bard.  But this class is so different from any of the other &quot;melee&quot; and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;casting&quot; classes that I honestly believe that it takes a special<br/>
&gt;&gt;individual<br/>
&gt;&gt;to play one and play it well (maybe I&#39;m just patting myself on the back,<br/>
&gt;&gt;but I<br/>
&gt;&gt;don&#39;t think so).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also play a Level 38 druid (no, I don&#39;t kite, or I probably WOULD be <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt;50 by now).  I have played her since day one of commercial.  In all that<br/>
&gt;time, I have grouped with exactly THREE bards.  Not because I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt;grouping with bards, but simply because there are so few of them available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night I had the opportunity and the unexpected pleasure of grouping<br/>
&gt;with a level 30 bard in Cazic. *waves to Celandro*  We were doing crocs and<br/>
&gt;praying to the EQ gods for the steel golem to spawn and drop some gloves <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;our cleric friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Because I play a bard, I am always more than happy to group with one if<br/>
&gt;possible.  I know the strengths of a bard, I know how great they are to <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;in a party, but I can tell you, there is nothing like experiencing what a<br/>
&gt;bard can do from a different perspective.  If I could have charmed Celandro<br/>
&gt;and made him my permanent pet, I would have done it! Hehe.  I learned ALOT<br/>
&gt;from Celandro, pestering him with questions (poor Cel!), watching him weave<br/>
&gt;his songs, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is NOTHING like being grouped with a GOOD bard, who knows his stuff.<br/>
