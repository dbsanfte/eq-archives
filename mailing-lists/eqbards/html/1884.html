<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655051714"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is there a less dangerous brass song that I can use later to<br/>
&gt; work on my brass skill?  I still don&#39;t like the idea of<br/>
&gt; leaving myself playing Discord overnight in some remote<br/>
&gt; location to work on the skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not until level 42.  so what i did was go into the tunnel in between east<br/>
commons and north ro, way back in the corner of the room with the shady<br/>
swashbuckler.  i got lots of food and water (though i don&#39;t think you can<br/>
die without it, just not regain stamina), put on my horn, put on my afk/anon<br/>
tags, started discord and went to sleep.  woke up from 5 to 150 brass.<br/>
