Unlike UO, there&#39;s a limit to how many items each character<br/>
can have.  You have your personal inventory, bank inventory,<br/>
worn items, and that&#39;s it.  Assuming you have all your<br/>
inventory full of 10 slot backpacks and chock full of items,<br/>
that&#39;s 160 items per character.  Call it 180 to account for<br/>
worn items.  Assume all 8 character slots are used in this<br/>
manner.  That&#39;s 1440 items per player.  Assume 5000 players<br/>
per server all doing this, and that&#39;s 7.2 million items as a<br/>
close-to-worst-case scenario.  If each item has 1k of data<br/>
associated with it, that&#39;s roughly 7 GB.  My PC&#39;s hard drive<br/>
is bigger than that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are only a thousand or fewer &quot;named&quot; mobs with special<br/>
drops in the game.  If you assume 5000 players per server, and<br/>
a 1000 mob bitfield, it&#39;s only 5 megabits, or about 625k of<br/>
extra data for the entire server.  I made a similar suggestion<br/>
to the UO dev team (for different reasons) and the problem<br/>
there was that this stuff is handled via a high level<br/>
scripting language; so you can&#39;t have a bitfield - a boolean<br/>
takes 1 byte minimum, probably more.  I agree it would be a<br/>
monumental task to graft it into the current system.  I was<br/>
thinking more in terms of future games (in case anyone on the<br/>
list finds himself as a programmer in such a game :).<br/>
<br/>
The other problem with the loot-once idea is that once you&#39;ve<br/>
looted pretty much everything, there&#39;s nothing left to do<br/>
except help other people get their stuff.<br/>
