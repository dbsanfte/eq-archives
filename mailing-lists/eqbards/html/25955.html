<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233969391">Hrm - maybe I should ask Rokken if I can mirror his info.  The EQBards site <br/>
is still active.  I should probably re-post my FAQ, while I&#39;m at it.<br/>

&gt;With EQSongs gone and now EQDiva looking like it will be<br/>
&gt;closing...what is really left?  I know the Concert Hall Message<br/>
&gt;boards are still there, but they are on EZBoard and I cannot access<br/>
&gt;those from my normal surf place (i.e., work has that site filtered).<br/>
&gt;I really miss the in-depth song analysis that we used to have<br/>
&gt;available!<br/>
