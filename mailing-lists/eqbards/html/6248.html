&gt; &gt; as jhenders said before, if you get a pull of multiple mobs that would make<br/>
&gt; &gt; your AE damage songs effective, you are pretty much toast and will have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get out of dodge anyway.  multiple pulls of high level mobs means everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; better concentrate on getting the same mob, one at a time, especially if an<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter is messing the others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll also add that when you get to around 30, the difference<br/>
&gt; in tanking ability between you and the other melee classes is<br/>
&gt; obvious.  Not only do they have a couple hundred more hp, but<br/>
&gt; their parries, blocks, and ripostes really cut down on the<br/>
&gt; damage they take.  When fighting in Cazic, the lizards that<br/>
&gt; take 20-30 seconds to drop my melee friends by one bubble<br/>
&gt; usually do the same to me in just two or three hits.  You do<br/>
&gt; *not* want to be playing an area effect damage song that will<br/>
&gt; make you the primary recipient of damage from all the mobs the<br/>
&gt; group currently isn&#39;t fighting.  If at all possible, let the<br/>
&gt; real tanks do the tanking.  The only time I try to take damage<br/>
&gt; anymore is if it&#39;s a tough fight (to ease the damage the<br/>
&gt; others are taking), I&#39;m the closest thing in the group to a<br/>
&gt; tank, or if I&#39;m trying to get a mob off a caster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We should mention however that like everything else in the game, these<br/>
aren&#39;t rules written in stone. You have to judge the situation. I<br/>
remember having some success with DDD and lullaby in Cazic, and even<br/>
played lullaby in Lower Guk once when we got mobbed by the remains of<br/>
someone else&#39;s train in the undead tower. Chain and fear can work<br/>
amazingly well in Cazic as well.<br/>
<br/>
The only hard and fast rule I&#39;ve ever really used is _never_ play the<br/>
fear song in Lower Guk, and there&#39;s probably some bard who has chained<br/>
and feared down there so even that&#39;s probably flexible. I&#39;ve tried all<br/>
kinds of stuff I normally wouldn&#39;t try, usually to try to get a mob (or<br/>
mobs) off the cleric since the charm song stopped working on mobs over<br/>
L38, as I sometimes seem to be the only one who can be spared from<br/>
beating on the primary target in a tough fight, or if there&#39;s no warrior<br/>
in the group, the hybrid&#39;s weak taunting skills become a liability.<br/>
