<div id="ygrps-yiv-375152603">Didn&#39;t see any interesting loot or named mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Me (level 40 bard) and a level 45 enchanter went there, explored the whole<br/>
tower from top to bottom for about 40 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the first floor, where the badgers are (when you enter the<br/>
tower, you&#39;re on the 2nd floor), there is a dropoff that you can take to<br/>
more badgers.  In this basement there is alot of water and tunels.  It<br/>
seemed that the badgers couldn&#39;t swim, so if you found an isolated island,<br/>
the badgers couldn&#39;t run away. (forgot to load up Chains).<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the basement is a teleporter that takes you back to Field of<br/>
Bones, by the entrance to the tower.  We never did find a way back up from<br/>
the basement to the first floor.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a necro or SK with you, they&#39;ll love all the bone chips you can<br/>
collect in there.<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] Kurn&#39;s Tower was  LAMENT and undead?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone know if there is any interesting loot in Kurn&#39;s tower?  I was<br/>
&gt; thinking it might be a good place to look for Burynai Bundt Cake.  Also<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; of my guilds lower level member were thinking of trying it.<br/>
