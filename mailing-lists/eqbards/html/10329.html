<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911974515">There is a well known fact to online games in relationship to <br/>
   player advancement.  I believe there is, in real life, a fundamental<br/>
   law that collectively describes this &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
   Players will take the path of least resistance (, to maximize<br/>
   the realized or potential gain - be it monetary or otherwise)<br/>
<br/>
   I coded on an LPmud for 2 years.  I wrote a lot of the object<br/>
   code and base structures, along with level design and balancing.<br/>
<br/>
   Being invisible, I could watch players find sneaky ways around<br/>
   certain obstacles.  With 20 or 30 coders, and a mesh of so many<br/>
   styles and items... no one could realize the potential impact<br/>
   of adding X item to the game on areas where X item was not<br/>
   designed in mind for.  Earning an item that stuns a mob every<br/>
   5 rounds combined with some other item that also stunned a <br/>
   monster produced a unwanted effect in the game.  Players knew<br/>
   that if they had these two items they could essentially beat<br/>
   any monster without risk.  Neither wizard was to blame for<br/>
   the coding of these items, it was the unrealized combined <br/>
   effect in an area which the coding wizard had no idea this<br/>
   could or would happen.  Players will find a way... with<br/>
   hundreds of items doing a hundred different effects, you will<br/>
   never know the complete outcome when players begin to experiment.<br/>
   <br/>
   Is it being resourceful?  Is it taking advantage of the code?<br/>
   Does it really matter?  Once I learned of a player &#39;exploiting&#39;<br/>
   a method against a particular mob, I would alter the behavior<br/>
   of the monster under those effects to create a more challenging<br/>
   confrontation.  It wasn&#39;t to ruin the player&#39;s experience, it<br/>
   was to heighten it.  I am a player of accomplishment.  If I<br/>
   play a game that&#39;s too easy, I tend to get tired easily.  If I<br/>
   play a game that offers new challenges each time, I tend to get<br/>
   addicted, ie EQ.<br/>
<br/>
   I don&#39;t like the way Verant introduces changes into the game,<br/>
   without understanding the major impacts they produce.  In fact<br/>
   I&#39;m also disillusioned with Everquest these days.  But it&#39;s not<br/>
   because they tweak the game so often; because after all, it will<br/>
   happen constantly.  It&#39;s like passing Bills in Congress, and <br/>
   some damn congressperson throws in a rider on something.  Verant<br/>
   puts &#39;riders&#39; on every patch we get.  I want them to make the<br/>
   game challenging, I want to look forward to tomorrow, and think<br/>
   what adventure am I going to undertake next.  What havent I done.<br/>
   What new is out there.  I just don&#39;t want the surprise of a code<br/>
   modification to impact my excitement/adventure/fun while I&#39;m<br/>
   playing.  My 2 cp.<br/>
