<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970289708">I think the real reason their combat system differed from ICE&#39;s Rolemaster<br/>
is you practically need a phd in mathermatics to decipher Rolemaster.  We<br/>
have tried to play it several times, but usually spend two weeks making<br/>
characters only to have them die in the first fight.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have to look up a table called :<br/>
Racial Soul Departure Modifier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not kidding...</div>
