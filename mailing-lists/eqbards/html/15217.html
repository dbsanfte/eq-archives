<div id="ygrps-yiv-33791302">I was genuinely stunned when this happened John.  I am so used to dying<br/>
first or second in these situations that when it didn&#39;t happen I didn&#39;t know<br/>
what to do.  I never planned a course of action for a scenario where the<br/>
group gets attacked but I don&#39;t since it had never occurred to me as a<br/>
possibility.  I stood there thinking &quot;Umm.. uhh.. What do the others do?&quot;,<br/>
so I went up the wall and camped.<br/>
<br/>
I only died twice in Hate last night, whereas two weekends ago I died 9 or<br/>
10 times, a big difference.  One of my deaths was because I pissed Innoruuk<br/>
off:<br/>
<br/>
You go Berserk.<br/>
You slash Innoruuk for 14 points of damage.<br/>
You resist the Gravity Flux spell!<br/>
Innoruuk shouts &quot;CRIER&quot;<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
He did NOT like me resisting his Gravity Flux one little bit.  heh.<br/>
<br/>
Innoruuk dropped a Dawnchaser btw, a Bard-only piercer that unfortunately<br/>
looks like a spear when equipped.  As with the other weapons from the<br/>
Meastro (Six Note Blade and Evensong mace) it&#39;s 11/25 with no proc.  The<br/>
guild chose another bard with a lot more Planar experience to award it to<br/>
(he now has the whole collection).  My turn will come.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This only seems unusual to us bards.  :)  While playing around<br/>
&gt; with sneak in various zones with no songs playing, I found out<br/>
&gt; this is how the game works for everyone *except* us.  If a mob<br/>
&gt; is aggroed on someone, you can be inside its aggro radius and<br/>
&gt; it won&#39;t aggro on you (unless you&#39;re close enough that it<br/>
&gt; decides to attack you instead).  I&#39;ve had giants, frogloks,<br/>
&gt; kobolds, and various bugs all run through me and never aggro<br/>
&gt; on me (should /con threatening while in sneak mode and behind<br/>
&gt; them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the way it works for bards is that if you&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; the aggro radius and your song pulses, that almost always adds<br/>
&gt; you to the hate list.<br/>
