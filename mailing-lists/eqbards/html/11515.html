&gt; I&#39;d agree if a level 47 person would gain any benefit from a 10 point<br/>
 </span></blockquote>damage<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shield.  That was my question, how often does a level 47+ person ever get<br/>
&gt; hit for 10 points or less?  Anyone out there who can answer that?  As it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a 10 pt damage shield would stop pretty much only the 1 pt hits I get.  I<br/>
&gt; seldom get hit for more than 1 and less than 10.  Do hit point shields<br/>
&gt; prevent damage from fire shields and the like?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NOTE: the numbers in the data file do not necessarily correspond to the<br/>
amount of bonus given by the song.<br/>
<br/>
The HP Absorbsion Shield (not damage shield as we called it earlier) will<br/>
absorb it&#39;s full amount of damage before it gets cancelled.  So if the Sand<br/>
Giant kicks you<br/>
for 30, you would take only 20, and the shield would be down, until your<br/>
song pulsed again.<br/>
<br/>
Once the song is actually tested, we can see how effective it is.  I think<br/>
is is a great idea, I just hope that the song will be useful in it&#39;s final<br/>
form.<br/>
