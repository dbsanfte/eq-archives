<b>Subject:</b> patch messed up my sound in EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945671578">I think I made a boo-boo, I upgraded to DX8 when it came out last week and I<br/>
noticed last night (post patch) that the sound affects for monster<br/>
environmental sounds (clicking beetles when they walk, noises when you hit<br/>
them etc.) were so faint I could only hear them if I put my ear right next<br/>
to my speaker.  I could, however, still hear howling wind and birds chirping<br/>
and my own avatar&#39;s footsteps.  Another weird thing is I could only hear<br/>
spell sounds when someone cast the spell on me...It was an eerie night in<br/>
Hate, too quiet.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe someone has some advice, I would hate to have to figure out how to<br/>
back out DX8 manually that seems like a bad task.<br/>
 <br/>
I am using a SoundBlaster Ensoniq PCI64 soundcard which came with my crappy<br/>
HP Pavilion 8280 when I bought it 2 years ago and I have never had any video<br/>
or sound problems before in EQ or anything else for that matter.<br/>
