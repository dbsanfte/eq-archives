&gt; have to hit to proc, you just have to swing.  i have taken notice of this<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, my friends have noticed their weapons procing without a<br/>
hit too.  But they also swear their weapons proc more often<br/>
when I play Chant of Battle with a drum (+28 to str and dex if<br/>
I recall correctly).  One thing is almost definite though - if<br/>
you speed up your attacks, the weapon will proc more in a<br/>
given space of time. :-)<br/>

Lately I&#39;ve been hearing that wisdom affects your chances of<br/>
being charmed.  No idea if that&#39;s true, or just a D&Dism (at<br/>
least I think it&#39;s a D&Dism) that&#39;s being mistakenly applied<br/>
by the players to EQ.<br/>
<br/>
GZ has mentioned wisdom affects your chance of fizzling a<br/>
spell.  It seems when GZ made a base 5% chance to fizzle even<br/>
the simplest spells, it also changed our missed note rate on<br/>
the simplest songs from 0% to 5%.  So if missed notes<br/>
correspond to fizzling spells, perhaps you high level bards<br/>
experiencing missed notes while starting the high level songs<br/>
can try wearing some wisdom enhancing items, and see if they<br/>
make a difference.<br/>
