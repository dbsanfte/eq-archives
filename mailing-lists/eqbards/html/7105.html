I have noticed a few things with this song that are not in your song<br/>
description.  The song can indeed be used to help people escape those<br/>
darned vacuum gates in Perma and Paw, but I have for the most part found<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t help.  It appears to me that the song only teleports you<br/>
to a place within it&#39;s range that you can see.  This has been verifeid by<br/>
me when I climbed the wizard spire in Greater Faydark and North Karana.<br/>
While on the top of the spire I woul look down at the ground though I<br/>
could not see it and the teleport drops me on the side of the spire.<br/>
<br/>
I will do some further testing when I get a chance, just to be 100% sure.<br/>
But after some trials in Perma, I do believe the teleport locations are<br/>
based on what you can you see. <br/>

&gt; 21 - Mellifluous Motion<br/>
&gt; Effect: Random teleport<br/>
&gt; Instrument: Wind, enhances distance teleported(?)<br/>
&gt; Target: Party<br/>
&gt; Does not stack with: N/A<br/>
&gt; Taunt: ??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quantified: ??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>
&gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>
&gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>
&gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>
&gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>
&gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Strategies:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of<br/>
&gt;   the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and<br/>
&gt;   Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn&#39;t work through walls<br/>
&gt;   anymore.  Once you&#39;re dragged up, you have walls on both sides so<br/>
&gt;   you won&#39;t teleport anywhere.  Still, it&#39;s worth a shot, especially<br/>
&gt;   if you&#39;re not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure<br/>
&gt;   you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far<br/>
&gt;   enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone<br/>
&gt;   without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to<br/>
&gt;   start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same<br/>
&gt;   thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cautions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since everyone<br/>
&gt;   teleports to different locations.  Of course if that&#39;s your intent...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I&#39;ve teleported right<br/>
&gt;   into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying<br/>
&gt;   to get a friend unstuck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>
&gt;   means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>
&gt;   easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>
&gt;   make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water. </span></blockquote></div>
