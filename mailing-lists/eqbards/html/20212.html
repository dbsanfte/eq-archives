Subject: [eqbards] bracer of the hidden<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Won a lotto item from inside the Sarnak castle on the<br/>
Lake...<br/>
<br/>
Bracer of the Hidden, AC 6, all, all<br/>
effect: see invisible<br/>
<br/>
Rare drop off sarnak legos.<br/>
<br/>
I was drowned in tells starting at 500 pp.<br/>
I sold it for 2K to a 54th lvl magician for the<br/>
&quot;convenience&quot; of being able to see his air pet.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I had no idea anyone would pay that much for<br/>
it...I would have been overjoyed with 200.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  Am I really goig to need this<br/>
THAT much at higher lvl?<br/>
<br/>
