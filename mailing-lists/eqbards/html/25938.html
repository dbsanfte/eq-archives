<div id="ygrps-yiv-897067091"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Also, I&#39;ve heard now that chorus of clarity and Soothing stack...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have heard this too, and the casters I group with seem to think it does.<br/>
Anyone able to verify this?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And that if you restart crack a bunch of times it stacks on itself?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Crack you mean Chorus of Clarity?  I doubt it, since it is not a DOT mana<br/>
regen its just a pulse of mana.  Hence, no icon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What are your favorite haste/melee buff songs and do any of them work with<br/>
&gt; amplification?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From what I have read, Amp does not up the haste % component of the haste<br/>
 </span></blockquote>songs.  I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
When grouped and fighing, I sing:<br/>
Vila&#39;s (36), CoB (1), Elemental (9) along with Amp every once in a while to<br/>
help agi on Vila&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
When goruped and down time, I sing<br/>
Clarity, Sooth, Amp<br/>
<br/>
Solo, well, I don&#39;t solo much, but then I do Johnthans (7), CoB (1), largo<br/>
(20).. Although now that I look at it I should do anthem (10) instead of<br/>
CoB.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well.  My 2 notes..<br/>
