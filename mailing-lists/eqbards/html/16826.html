 </span></blockquote>  Who said my opinion was the only possible one?  Man, you need to stop<br/>
  reading into these posts.  So far you&#39;ve done it several times, and<br/>
  John(tm) even had to make a comment on it.  You forgot to take your<br/>
  medicine today.  How about not jumping all over people on the list?<br/>
  Since you&#39;ve been here, you&#39;ve done nothing but argue unproductively.<br/>
  If you&#39;ve played since Beta 2, we are happy for you, others here have<br/>
  as well.  You flaunt your knowledge as if you designed the game.  <br/>
  Senior Guide on whatever server or not, I would just chill out and<br/>
  try to be helpful.  We don&#39;t need any more smartasses =)<br/>
