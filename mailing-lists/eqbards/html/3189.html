<b>Subject:</b> Voice Communications: BattleCom vs Roger Wilco <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-947735812">Before finishing reading this pop over to GameSpot.com and <br/>
do a FULL TEXT (not title) search on Battlecom and you will <br/>
get a CGW article from the July issue (the one with the big<br/>
QUAKE III in yellow on the cover) discussing the merits of both<br/>
Roger Wilco and BattleCom.<br/>
<br/>
  Ah ! you read it. Seems Roger Wilco has a memory bled that causes<br/>
you to have to log off and restart it after a half hour because the<br/>
communication degrads. BattleCom on the other hand was solid enough<br/>
that Microsoft just brought them out to be able to make that internet<br/>
audio actually PART of Windows 2000 for next summers release.<br/>
  Give me BattleCOM any time. Relogging breaks up parties :)<br/>

  EVERYBODY should get this program and use it. I first ran into a group<br/>
using voice communications 2 weeks ago and they ran rings around<br/>
other players in reacting to MOBs, tactics and all else. Having just gotten<br/>
killed because I couldn&#39;t type &quot;everybody on the spell caster !&quot; fast enough<br/>
<br/>
I am a true believer. Now, If you see Moonflower around ask her to<br/>
start a voice session !!!  It will get to the point that is the only way<br/>
she will play.</div>
