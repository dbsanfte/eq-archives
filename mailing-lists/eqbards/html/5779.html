<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180221343">Glad to see Verrants backing you up on this one Melaniel! It was so nice to<br/>
see a positive result to an unhappy situation. I personally have not had<br/>
that situation occur but I have restarted from scratch before, and it was<br/>
HARD.  Of my own choice at lvl 22ish I pretty much gave up all the items I<br/>
had and restarted building my collection of goodies. My reason was a good<br/>
one I think, and I have never once regretted the loss of my plate, or my<br/>
well balanced weapons ( HOW did I get them so young you ask? Well  I was<br/>
gifted them by a more powerful player and without going into the details my<br/>
honor required me to return them) At any rate good luck to you!<br/>
