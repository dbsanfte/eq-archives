<div id="ygrps-yiv-129726977">Stop with this bandwidth b.s. - the internet is made out of huge bandwidth.<br/>
Even 200 emails on bard stats is not gonna make your modem light blink.<br/>
<br/>
Boring to you is another issue - but dont say bandwidth when you mean<br/>
boring.  Delete or filter stuff you dont wanna read.  (hehe you can prolly<br/>
&quot;killfile&quot; me and save half your &quot;bandwidth&quot; &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
There is valuable info for young bards here -- when you are young is the<br/>
time to know how you compare.  For example, with my lowly 75 in str - I CANT<br/>
carry a full set of bronze.  If you wanna be a bard and wear plate and wear<br/>
bronze plate, then you better have alot of str.  I got lots of str booster<br/>
and am bearly able to walk around with a minimal amount of stuff and all the<br/>
visible bronze pieces except boots - cant wear with being encumbered from<br/>
the git go.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
So, if there are young bards out there who want plate, then they need to<br/>
know - cuz a restart at level 5 is LOTS better than a restart at level 15.<br/>

&gt;People - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE respond via private email to this survey.  I<br/>
&gt;am sure the majority of us - while perhaps interested in the results of the<br/>
&gt;survey - aren&#39;t interested in the raw data.  I am guessing there are<br/>
&gt;something like 250+ people on this list (no clue - just a guess) - making<br/>
&gt;250 people see your stats is a big waste of bandwidth..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
