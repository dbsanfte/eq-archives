<b>Subject:</b> Dual wield vs using a shield (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-283099392">I have a question for higher level bards. Currently Im a 16th level bard and<br/>
will soon learn the Dual Wield skill upon obtaining 17th level.  Up until<br/>
last night, I was using a wooden shield.  I had planned on using Dual Wield<br/>
exclusively once I got the skill.  However, I got very lucky and looted a<br/>
shiny brass shield (SBS) from the orc trainer.  How I got it was a pretty<br/>
good story so I would like to pass it on before I go further.  I returned to<br/>
Crushbone after a long absence to purchase a dragoon dirk.  I had full<br/>
intentions of returning to Antonica as soon as I got a dirk.  Since I was in<br/>
CB, I decided to see if I could get a SBS.  When I go to the hill there were<br/>
only a couple of other people there. I explained to them I only wanted one<br/>
shot at the trainer and that if I didn&#39;t get the SBS I would be on my way.<br/>
They agreed to let me go first in the rotation.  The trainer appeared twice<br/>
but was stolen from me twice by someone who arrived after the initial<br/>
agreement was made.  The killstealer finally left and the trainer spawned a<br/>
third time.  I ended up killing him.  To my luck, the very first time I<br/>
killed the orc trainer I looted the SBS.  Can now gladly say that I don&#39;t<br/>
think I will ever go into CB again.  If I ever decide to use a Screaming<br/>
Mace, I think I will just purchase it from someone rather than suffer the<br/>
chaos of CB.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to the original question.  Now that I have the SBS, I&#39;m wondering about<br/>
the tradeoff between using two weapons versus the extra AC and magic<br/>
protection (+10) that the SBS provides.  Currently I have two magic weapons,<br/>
the dragoon dirk and Crookstinger.  Both are piercing weapons and very fast.<br/>
The dirk is DAM 6 and DLY 23.  Crookstinger is DAM 4 and DLY 21.  I<br/>
personally like the idea of dual wielding these two weapons.  However,<br/>
knowing that bards are usually #1 on the mobs hate list, it also seems like<br/>
a good idea to keep my AC up.  I guess the key factor in deciding between<br/>
the two is that over the course of a battle, does the extra damage inflicted<br/>
by dual wielding (once that skill is maxed out) offset the extra damage you<br/>
receive due to having a lower AC?  <br/>
<br/>
Just based off my observations, every character I have seen who can dual<br/>
wield seems to do so and foregoes using a shield.  I assume that dual<br/>
wielding is the way to go but would like to hear what the higher level bards<br/>
have to say.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
