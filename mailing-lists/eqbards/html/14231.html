<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089125931">Harmonic I agree with you 100% I used to use Lullaby MUCH more often, and still<br/>
at times do in Caziac entry to slow the action.. hardly works now but is better then nothing.  However it is possible that they did not change the song.  The problem is they probably DID alter the resist code which the song rolls against. Remember we don&#39;t count in the grand Verant plan.<br/>
What they DO lie about and I really think we need to do something about this, is that they have anyone actually play testing bards.  One of the most important things I think we need to do is demand a bard advocate to replace GZ.<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole Archmage Answers Fiasco proves beyond doubt having the mage decide what our powers and songs should be doesn&#39;t work.  We need to appeal to Brad and Abashi, and the heads of Verant for a TRUE person with a vision for a bard.. and to stop being an after thought<br/>

&gt;   I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly<br/>
&gt;   took.  I have some of my own, but these show the outside perspective.<br/>

&gt;   I think I was L19 in these pictures.	Full bronze which I worked<br/>
&gt;   my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>
&gt;   when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>
&gt;   I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>
&gt;   there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>
&gt;   anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>
&gt;   they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>
&gt;   off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group<br/>
&gt;   controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>
&gt;   to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>
&gt;   this song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
