monks, and other pullers, in that order.  We try to avoid randoming loot,<br/>
instead giving it to those who contribute most and who use it best.<br/>
Although there are many good arguments for why a bard should be on par<br/>
with an enchanter for this item, I feel that it should still go to the<br/>
enchanter first.  If our crowd control mechanism fails, we can take a few<br/>
hits.  Casters, however, are more frail by nature, and when my life is in<br/>
the hands of someone else&#39;s mez, I don&#39;t want them to be the first to die.<br/>
