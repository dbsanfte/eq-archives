If he protests, just fire up Jaxon&#39;s Jig of Vigor, and try to convince him<br/>
that it was a mistake, it really does help mana regen afterall...<br/>
&quot;Dude!  Look at your mana bar go!  Woot!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like the group xp bonus.  First there was a bonus, then there wasn&#39;t,<br/>
now they&#39;ve admitted there is, and it&#39;s getting bigger! (yay!)...heh.<br/>

<br/>
*	Other versions of our chains (the lvl 23 and lvl 54 aoe song) and<br/>
slow songs (lvl 21 aoe) against snare or slow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consonant Chains (23) does now &#39;stack&#39; with snare.  I was using it in<br/>
Dreadlands and Sol B over the weekend.  Perviously if I sang Chains on a<br/>
snared mob, once the Chains fell, so did snare.  Not any more.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried Melodic Binding (20, not 21) yet, but will try tonight.<br/>

And might I just add I&#39;m getting sick of the whole &quot;All your base are belong<br/>
to us!&quot; thing?  One particularly immature mage in my group insisted on<br/>
saying &quot;All your Bard are belong to us... hehe&quot; *every* *single* time I<br/>
fired up Chorus of Clarity.<br/>
