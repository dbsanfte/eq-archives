&gt; &gt; I was in a pickup group of warrior, warrior, shadowknight, <br/>
&gt; mage, enchanter <br/>
&gt; &gt; (all 40-44) and me, a charming, debonair, devil-may-care <br/>
&gt; woodelf bard with <br/>
&gt; &gt; 37 songs.  Obviously I was the only healer (ack!) but <br/>
&gt; thankfully the group <br/>
&gt; &gt; was pretty high-powered and the tanks knew their jobs.  We <br/>
&gt; were in the pool <br/>
&gt; &gt; room fighting swarms of GKs, which the enchanter thankfully <br/>
&gt; kept enthralled. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The night wore on, and I decided to test a different <br/>
&gt; tactic: chains, <br/>
&gt; &gt; celerity, hymn, wielding a mandolin the whole fight.  I <br/>
&gt; reasoned that I was <br/>
&gt; &gt; not doing much of the damage, and perhaps the fights would <br/>
&gt; go the same <br/>
&gt; &gt; either way... the results exceeded my expectations by quite <br/>
&gt; a bit.  Where <br/>
&gt; &gt; before one or both fighters and sometimes the mage would be <br/>
&gt; down a bubble or <br/>
&gt; &gt; two after each round of a few GKs, now nobody lost even a <br/>
&gt; half bubble of <br/>
&gt; &gt; health.  I still waded into melee and did *some* damage <br/>
&gt; with my fists, but <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Melee-heavy groups are a lot of fun if everyone is competent.  <br/>
&gt; Basically, you have everyone&#39;s readiness status up in front of<br/>
&gt; you all the time (their health bars).  So you can play around<br/>
&gt; with healing and pulling to settle on a rate where the action<br/>
&gt; is pretty much non-stop without having to ask &quot;mana?&quot; all the<br/>
&gt; time.  (Casters can join in on the nonstop fun too if they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; good about conserving their mana. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mind you, playing Hymn with a lute instead of using weapons<br/>
&gt; meant each fight was taking a little bit longer.  But if you<br/>
&gt; were waiting to heal up after each fight anyway, then your<br/>
&gt; kill rate would be better if you can keep everyone almost<br/>
&gt; topped (since waiting to heal time = not-doing-any-damage<br/>
&gt; time).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of people complain about excessive downtime in this<br/>
&gt; game.  The one thing no other class can touch a bard at is<br/>
&gt; reducing or eliminating downtime.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This matches up with my experience very well. My experience in Mistmoore is<br/>
about level 25-26 around the lake/graveyard. I&#39;ve had the chance to fight<br/>
with many different groups.<br/>
<br/>
The tank only group I fought in had almost no downtime with a warrior going<br/>
out and pulling at the end of each fight -- what&#39;s with these guys anyway,<br/>
always fetching with only 75% health? I had to sometimes follow the warrior<br/>
just to get him healed? :-) Pretty much continuous action. I sang Anthem,<br/>
Hymn and swapped between Elemental Rhythms or Chains, depending on what we<br/>
were fighting. At this time not a lot of people in the zone, so we had lots<br/>
to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Mixed group of hybrids and casters where the bards are the tanks. For some<br/>
reason, I always had another bard to fight alongside with in these battles.<br/>
:-) Us bards were able to take turns absorbing the damage while wizards and<br/>
druids/shaman blasted the thing to smitherines. A lot of downtime waiting<br/>
for the casters to med up. A bard is a definitely a Shaman&#39;s best friend as<br/>
they drain their life for mana (necros fall into this category as well, but<br/>
never grouped with one in Mistmoore). But with the crowdedness of Mistmoore<br/>
at the time, this really wasn&#39;t much of a problem as they had plenty of time<br/>
until we could pull something to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Magicians - I was in a group of 2 magicians and boy are these guys fun to<br/>
play with! I have an 18th level magician myself, and while I always figure<br/>
Wizards to be the blasters extraordinaire, the fights seemed to be over a<br/>
lot faster with these guys. Pet control is a little iffy but Mistmoore was<br/>
so camped at the time there was little danger of the pet running out and<br/>
pulling something real bad. ***I am kind of curious as to how well Magicians<br/>
do in some of the other dungeons. I&#39;ve read lots of warnings about pets in<br/>
dungeons, but without a pet, Magicians become slow casters that don&#39;t quite<br/>
do as much damage. Also their &quot;bolt&quot; line of spells seem best for soloing as<br/>
no group members get in their LOS.<br/>
<br/>
Balanced group - Cleric, enchanter, tanks and me. Good action in the<br/>
graveyard (I was the youngest in the group) but each battle was followed by<br/>
a good medding session, which worked out okay due to spawn rate. Got a good<br/>
amount of exp until a caitliff (sp?) walked by and blasted me to<br/>
smithereens. I was just playing my healing song, but that seems to be a<br/>
&quot;famous last bardic words&quot; phrase as she aggro&#39;d on me from across the<br/>
graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not up to the level where an enchanter becomes a &quot;must&quot; like in<br/>
the higher level groups. But the times I have grouped with them, I&#39;ve found<br/>
the best enchanters are the ones who pretty much direct everything. Pretty<br/>
logical since they are controlling the environment that everyone else fights<br/>
in. Also, a lot of the enchanters are women, and who doesn&#39;t like a<br/>
strong-willed woman telling you what to do?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning.&quot; (Ok,<br/>
so this quote wasn&#39;t said by a woman.)<br/>
