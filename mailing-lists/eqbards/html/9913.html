&gt; &gt; I tried to Chain/Fear Choon the other night at level 31.  My Fear just<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t seem to be taking hold on this guy.  It was like he was out of<br/>
&gt; range<br/>
&gt; &gt; (no resist message), but he was hitting me for 60s and 70s.  I dutifully<br/>
&gt; &gt; stood at his feet Screeching while he pummeled me trying to get it to<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold.  Screech *finally* worked and he turned and fled.  I had exactly<br/>
&gt; 12<br/>
&gt; &gt; HPs left at that point, so I decided chasing after him was probably a<br/>
&gt; bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea.<br/>

&gt; Maybe this &quot;song isn&#39;t resisted but has no effect&quot; bug affects<br/>
&gt; more than just Pixie Strike...<br/>

fighting in Rathe Mts. I&#39;ve noticed sometimes I&#39;ll fire it up on giant<br/>
skelies (blue to me) and nothing, no message, no fear.  <br/>
<br/>
	I do love it when it works though!  Especially on red clops, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
	One word of warning, don&#39;t use it unless you know which way the<br/>
thing is gonna run.  Was in Cazic at the steps to the temple, and feared<br/>
one, hoping it would run up the steps, get brave, and run back down.  Nope,<br/>
it ran right into the maze and brought back 2 friends.  Fortunately the<br/>
group had 2 enchanters, so they could control them till we killed them all.<br/>
Last time (hopefully) I&#39;ll make that mistake.<br/>
