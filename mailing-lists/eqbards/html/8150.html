<div id="ygrps-yiv-438469560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;On eight different occasions, I have had a negative effect <br/>
&gt;disappear as soon as the song did its first static charge pulse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Purely coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
I was fighting the SK/Shaman duo in Rathe Mnts the other night.<br/>
<br/>
Clinging Darkness (dot + snare)<br/>
Targ-something Insects (drowsy)<br/>
Root (shaman)<br/>
Infectous Cloud (shaman disease)<br/>
Heat Blood (dot)<br/>
<br/>
I purposely had ADM memmorized to clear this garbage, it did<br/>
nothing but give the static pulse message and put an extra icon<br/>
on my screen.  With lute in hand, I tried to start the song then<br/>
attack, and blamo I was Clinging Darkness and Drowsy immediately.<br/>
<br/>
I even tested more things too the other night,<br/>
This song has absolutely zero effects when:<br/>
<br/>
o played before battle to be pro-active (preventative).<br/>
o played during battle to cancel said effects.<br/>
o played after battle for an extended period of time.<br/>
o played while selecting the enemy who cast on me.<br/>
o played while selecting no target.<br/>
o played while selecting me as the target.<br/>
o played while selecting a group member as target.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I did get a few times where I noticed I was under<br/>
a bad spell, and then tried to click the ADM and by the<br/>
time I fumbled the lute into my hands - it disappeared<br/>
at close to the same time.  Most ill effects are very short<br/>
lived.  But this song is definitely broken, and I tested<br/>
it for the entire duration of my camping those guards for<br/>
3 or 4 hours under a variety of circumstances.<br/>
