<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538583495">Well, I was chaining SG&#39;s last night no problem.  Maybe 1 resist in about 50<br/>
attempts. (I was soloing, so a LOT of chaining was used).  Later I was<br/>
walking by Dorn&#39;s camp and decided to kill him just to pass a minute or two.<br/>
After pounding him down to within an inch of his life, he started to run.  I<br/>
fired up chains.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  5 resists<br/>
before it took.  Dunno if its always been like this or not with Dorn, last<br/>
time I fought him I was around level 15.  Seemed strange though.<br/>

Last night the Cerf.net servers all went down so I logged into Tarrew<br/>
Marr to play my bard for the first time in a while. I decided to go see<br/>
if I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while looking ran<br/>
across Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels below me and<br/>
I fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8 resists in a<br/>
row. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any hill giants in<br/>
the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>
Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>
on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>
time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>
reliability than this.</div>
