&lt;&lt; I really hate it when a bard who hasn&#39;t explored all the uses for the more<br/>
 powerful songs we get disses one as &quot;it&#39;s not useful&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really hate it when a bard doesn&#39;t know another bard and assumes things, in <br/>
turn making themselves look foolish. <br/>
<br/>
  I have used charm extensively, but now being 50 i hardly ever use it. Bats/ <br/>
bugs etc  aren&#39;t charmable, and now guk is a joke. I haven&#39;t been back there <br/>
in months. Sure, upgraded song would allow us to charm higher level things, <br/>
but I am hoping for all new songs, not just rehashes. But oh well, replying <br/>
to this is pretty pointless. . I love how because I post my views on how I <br/>
would like to play in the expansion it is &quot;wrong&quot;.  I think your post is <br/>
obvious flame bait. What level are you ? sign your posts please, I honestly <br/>
don&#39;t know how to reply seeing as I have no idea where you are coming from.  <br/>
        Bleh , go camp something , that seems to be what makes you happy. <br/>
Fine, I was just saying I would like songs with both form and function. I <br/>
don&#39;t play to camp anymore, I play for friends, for raids, and to help out <br/>
lower level people. I will prolly stay on longer if at least a couple of our <br/>
songs had some sort of RP applicable aspect to them ( the illusion one being <br/>
a great one ) but I doubt you know what RP is , nor have any interest in it. <br/>
        Good luck , get 50 ( you win ! ) then get 60 ( you win ! ) then quit <br/>
and go back to Quake.<br/>
