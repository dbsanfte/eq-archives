&gt;Ah, now that&#39;s two questions answered at once.  I&#39;ve zoned into places and<br/>
&gt;noticed messages in the chat window saying a &lt;insert local baddy name here&gt;<br/>
&gt;tries to hit you but misses just before the zone message and though &quot;hmm,<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t recall anyone swiping at me&quot;  And a while back a friend of mine was<br/>
&gt;having a multiple deaths night and found a corpse at a zone border he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;remember leaving one at which had duplicates of his back up armor!  Sweet!<br/>
&gt;Wish I had that kind of luck.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*ACTUALLY* hehe - what you&#39;ve experienced is something *entirely*<br/>
different, I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re related - it&#39;s just a lag-bubble popping<br/>
on you.  If you ever see a message like &quot;You swing at &lt;playername&gt; and<br/>
miss! &lt;Playername&gt; died!&quot; send a tell to that player - they died exactly<br/>
when you were zoning in and somehow the server got confused about who was<br/>
doing what...  Happens to me all the time, (at least once a night) so I<br/>
really believe it to be lag-related.<br/>
