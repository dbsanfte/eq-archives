<div id="ygrps-yiv-93173574"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
&gt;game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.<br/>
&gt;If they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests)<br/>
&gt;please at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how/where &gt;to get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste<br/>
our time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The last I heard on this, GZ said they were waiting on &quot;some things to be<br/>
implemented&quot; before they could add those songs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you mihgt ask why missed notes occur so often with even the lowest lvl<br/>
songs.  I&#39;m 26th, play Hymn and Selo&#39;s on a nearly constant basis, and STILL<br/>
miss notes quite often.  If you play a song that much, you should not even<br/>
miss notes in your sleep.  Also, is it just bards, or do blue con&#39;s resist<br/>
the hell out of the caster&#39;s spells too?  (Got 5, that&#39;s right &quot;FIVE&quot;<br/>
resisits on DDD in a row from the hermit in SK the other night :o/  )<br/>
