<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-174585704">Hmmm.  I got thru level 20 buy hunting in Highhold<br/>
Keep.  I would get my name on the Main Room List and<br/>
then go to the gnoll side of Highhold Pass and solo<br/>
the various spawns there until my name came up.  I<br/>
went from 1/4 bubble into 20 to a sliver left to level<br/>
last Sunday. Only one death in that time due to a<br/>
couple of our casters deciding to duel between spawns<br/>
and were therefore low on mana when a guard spawned. <br/>
I got level 21 the next night after about 4 kills.  So<br/>
level 20 was relatively painless for me.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go someplace that isn&#39;t camped (at<br/>
least on Mithaniel Marr) then pick up one other person<br/>
near your level and go to the Undead Isle.  This is<br/>
the first island to the right when facing the ocean<br/>
from the dock at the Sister&#39;s Isle.  You can recognize<br/>
it because it is barren rock.  You have to kill the<br/>
Greater Skeletons to get the Gargoyles to spawn.  The<br/>
Gargoyles will range in level from low blues to<br/>
yellows for a level 20 character.  With 2 people you<br/>
should be able to pick up about 1/2 a bubble an hour<br/>
with no deaths.  There are 4 spectres at the very top<br/>
of the island.  Aggro those and don&#39;t even bother to<br/>
run because your dead, but this will never happen with<br/>
a little bit of caution.  As an additional benefit the<br/>
Gargoyles drop eyes that you can sell at the Sister<br/>
Isle for 9.5 pp each with &quot;Kindly&quot; faction.  My<br/>
hunting partner and I made 45pp in about 2 hours there<br/>
this past weekend.  Also the Gargoyle death animation<br/>
is one of the best I&#39;ve seen so far.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got my bard to 20th level...<br/>
&gt; I played 20th level for about 6 weeks ( a couple of<br/>
&gt; hours a night).  Every<br/>
&gt; death cost me about a week of play time.<br/>
&gt; One group I was in, let me die 3 times, with no one<br/>
&gt; else near death (2<br/>
&gt; clerics!), so i bailed.  I&#39;ve nearly lost 20th, now,<br/>
&gt; and have pretty much retired my bard.  (Who ever<br/>
&gt; said 20 wasn&#39;t a hell<br/>
&gt; level???).  I&#39;m playing my DE Enchanter now (up to<br/>
&gt; 9th level)<br/>
&gt; Leveling the enchanter is much easier than it was<br/>
&gt; with the bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would LOVE to continue playing my bard, but I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t figure out how to get<br/>
&gt; experience, and keep it, especially in pick-up<br/>
&gt; groups.  Unfortunately, most<br/>
&gt; of my guild has surpassed me in levels, and I no<br/>
&gt; longer get xp if I group<br/>
&gt; with them.  I would love to power-level up to around<br/>
&gt; 25 or so, and join my<br/>
&gt; guildmates, but I have been unable to find anyplace<br/>
&gt; that is not camped to<br/>
&gt; the hilt on Solusek Ro.  The aviaks are consistently<br/>
&gt; camped, both in South<br/>
&gt; Karana and Lake Rathe.  Solusek A is a death trap. <br/>
&gt; Likewise, with Unrest<br/>
&gt; and the Cauldron.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone out there has some novel ideas on how to<br/>
&gt; find stuff to solo power<br/>
&gt; level with, I would love to hear it.   But, for now,<br/>
&gt; MacGrough is retired<br/>
&gt; (sitting in ButcherBlock after 2 deaths in<br/>
&gt; Cauldron).<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Couple of people have posted and been struggling<br/>
&gt; during the same levels I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had difficulty with the first time around, so I<br/>
&gt; thought I&#39;d drop a few<br/>
&gt; tips<br/>
&gt; &gt; on how and why you should peserve (its amazing<br/>
&gt; what you see in hindsight):<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The general concensus is that the time from 19th<br/>
&gt; to 26th is quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; fustrating; you&#39;re at the point were the disparity<br/>
&gt; between your melee and<br/>
&gt; &gt; your tank friends melee prowess begins to show,<br/>
&gt; and yet your songs don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; adiquately compensate for that lost.  Its<br/>
&gt; difficult to find a good group<br/>
&gt; &gt; during this time because this is also the weed out<br/>
&gt; period - worse that<br/>
&gt; hell<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that<br/>
&gt; class in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At anyrate, your position is clear (push past<br/>
&gt; these levels as quickly as<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible) and while boring, doing the noterious<br/>
&gt; deepwater goblin pets of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake Rathetear will get you though it, and will<br/>
&gt; get you out of your rut.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2<br/>
&gt; pets still run by every 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; mins.  As someone here stated before [referring to<br/>
&gt; hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>
&gt; &gt; over quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the<br/>
&gt; ogres on the hill if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; solo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; a group and go to work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You have a convient zone line if something goes<br/>
&gt; wrong and a food and water<br/>
&gt; &gt; vendor literally next door.  You can kill the<br/>
&gt; bandits on the other side of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the gut handily for lunch money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in<br/>
&gt; about a week with modest<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt; time doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s<br/>
&gt; songs, powered by your new<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher levels, will be more effective and desired<br/>
&gt; in a group (for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; record, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have<br/>
&gt; mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; grouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; pay me to forget the<br/>
&gt; song.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just like insurance, ya hope you never have to use<br/>
&gt; it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>
&gt; &gt; home without it.).  I suppose there is an argument<br/>
&gt; to go through these<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels the traditional way, but I did that the<br/>
&gt; first time around -- it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; painful and in the end the only valuable<br/>
&gt; lesson/tactic/govering principle<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; drew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that<br/>
&gt; again!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have fun and good luck,<br/>
