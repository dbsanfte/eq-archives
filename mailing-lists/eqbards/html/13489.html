&gt;Someone on the E&#39;ci message board expressed a similar opinion about PoA<br/>
&gt;being a major money sink.  The poster theorized that the following will<br/>
&gt;start happening:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;46+ level characters generally have more money than they know what to do<br/>
&gt;with.  Because PoA is a big money sink, this cash reserve will eventually<br/>
&gt;get low and possibly run out.  As a result, 46+ characters will have to go<br/>
&gt;back to lower level areas and camp high value items that they don&#39;t need in<br/>
&gt;order to sell them for cash so they can get back into PoA.  This will have<br/>
&gt;two likely side effects.  First, lower level characters who don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;high value item will have problems because they will have to compete with<br/>
&gt;46+ level characters for the spawn point.  Second effect is that now it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;become easier to buy these items for cash.  Prior to the patch (when<br/>
&gt;platinum was plentiful), most people would only trade a high value item for<br/>
&gt;another high value item that they could use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IMO, this could turn out to be an unexpected side benefit from the PoA.  A<br/>
&gt;lot of people, myself included, are not inclined or don&#39;t have the time<br/>
&gt;required to camp for high value items.  As a result, it was difficult for<br/>
&gt;those type of players to obtain the item on their own or to purchase it<br/>

&gt;&gt;   I&#39;m reluctant to pay 230p to get in and 700p to buy keys<br/>
&gt;&gt;   to cross what appears to be the desert of Ro in the air, just to meet<br/>
&gt;&gt;   up with some f&#39;ing imp who can kill me by triple attacking in the 190s<br/>
&gt;&gt;   in less than 2 seconds.  No thanks. hehe.<br/>

&gt;&gt;   Plane of Sky is a flop.  They are going too far with this monkey sink<br/>
&gt;&gt;   bs.  Time to go beat up some ice giants now for the cash to hit the<br/>
&gt;&gt;   plane so I can die to find out what goodies are up there, if any.<br/>
