<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339050703">Right on Polanya.  Been in many Sebilis groups with a shaman or druid as<br/>
primary healer.  In those groups I always go for healing and haste (used to<br/>
be nivs+hymn+haste, now Catana+nivs+haste).  The only thing that annoys me<br/>
more then the &#39;we have to have a healer&#39; types is the &#39;have to have a<br/>
chanter&#39; types.  Was in Sebilis the other night and we had blast in the<br/>
bar/armorer rooms. I was primary CC and we were doing great.  Group broke up<br/>
and the next group I was in spent the next two hours whining about how we<br/>
had to have and enchanter.  We could have easily gone down and rebroken the<br/>
bar/armorer area, but instead did Gangrenous *yawn*.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just gotta throw in my opinion here.  If I had waited to find <br/>
&gt; balanced <br/>
&gt; groups, I would<br/>
&gt; never have gotten to 53.  I have made a considerable portion of my 53 <br/>
&gt; levels with just a<br/>
&gt; warrior at my side.  We welcome others to group with us <br/>
&gt; without regard for <br/>
&gt; class because<br/>
&gt; for the most part we don&#39;t need any specific class.  I really <br/>
&gt; get annoyed <br/>
&gt; at the &quot;we have<br/>
&gt; to have a healer&quot; types.  I am the first to admit that I am a <br/>
&gt; cleric junkie <br/>
&gt; but with careful<br/>
&gt; planning, (and more careful pulling), our healing songs, and <br/>
&gt; a stack of <br/>
&gt; band aids we are usually fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I am posting, I might as well get screamed at for this <br/>
&gt; observation.  With any healer<br/>
&gt; type other than a cleric, I can heal the party up faster than <br/>
&gt; they can heal <br/>
&gt; us and then med<br/>
&gt; up enough mana to be ready to go again.   At first I marked <br/>
&gt; it up to a bad <br/>
&gt; player but as I have<br/>
&gt; partied with more folks, this observation still holds true.  <br/>
&gt; Scream away at <br/>
&gt; me, tell me that<br/>
&gt; I am crazy.  No worries from me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;i find it too hard to wait around for a balanced group, so i <br/>
&gt; grab whoever <br/>
&gt; &gt;happens to<br/>
&gt; &gt;be around and drag em off to sebilis.  well actually most of <br/>
&gt; the time i <br/>
&gt; &gt;just live in<br/>
&gt; &gt;sebilis and pick up whoever happens to be hanging around the <br/>
&gt; zonein.  so <br/>
&gt; &gt;we usually<br/>
&gt; &gt;have at least on hole in the group, sometimes more, heh.<br/>
