I&#39;ve heard  that this is a carry over from one of the old &quot;merchant&quot; bugs<br/>
that used to be in the game.  You have to have your upper-most left<br/>
inventory slot free.  Several bards on the concert hall have reported this -<br/>
with that slot open you (should) get your stone.<br/>
