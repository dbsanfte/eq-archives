<div id="ygrps-yiv-242613786">Again I reitterate...<br/>
<br/>
I want to know if anyone has LOOTED one AFTER te hole came out.<br/>
<br/>
Does me no good that you got 6 of them (When he dropped it everytime) if it is no longer the common<br/>
(Obvious) or wether it has indeed been moved (Likely) or changed to his Rare (Most likely).<br/>
<br/>
I was camping The Kly for over 24 hours in two days. Saw two, and got helmets both times. That is why I am<br/>
asking for confirmation that it is still on The Kly. If it is, then I can still camp it waiting like any<br/>
other rare....if not. Then Dalnir&#39;s is not a place I need to ever go again =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been there since The Hole open, so I can&#39;t confirm or deny<br/>
&gt; this rumor, but PRE-The Hole, I have seen 6 drop and have physically<br/>
&gt; looted 4 (between my GF who sits right next to me on my LAN and I).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep in mind that &quot;The Kly Overseer&quot; is NOT who you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s the placeholder and he doesn&#39;t even seem to have a rare drop.<br/>
&gt; You get better loot from the various lesser klys in the room.  &quot;The<br/>
&gt; Kly&quot; (that&#39;s his whole name), spawns less than 5% of the time in my<br/>
&gt; experience and his ONLY drop AFAIK is the Necklace of Superiority.<br/>
&gt; There may be a rare drop, but I have not heard of it.  And, I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; imagine another item I&#39;d rather get, so I&#39;d be pretty pissed off if<br/>
&gt; it wasn&#39;t the necklace on him, heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if you&#39;ve seen The Kly and have not looted the necklace, then<br/>
&gt; chances are it&#39;s been moved.  If you have only seen The Kly Overseer,<br/>
&gt; then you haven&#39;t done enuf time. :)  We&#39;ve killed over 160 Overseers<br/>
&gt; and have seen 6 The Klys, including a stretch of 16 hours or so<br/>
&gt; without any at all and 2 The Klys back to back.  (Of course this is<br/>
&gt; mostly 4 - 6 hour camps stretched over several days.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please let me know if you have seen &quot;The Kly&quot; and he did not drop the<br/>
&gt; Necklace as I was intending to go back very soon.  The trade offers I<br/>
&gt; get for the necklace are just too great to pass up and my neck spot<br/>
&gt; is now open.  So far, I&#39;ve gotten 1) GE Boots and Impskin Gloves, 2)<br/>
&gt; Froglock Bonecaster&#39;s Robe, 3) Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword, Runed<br/>
&gt; Lava Pendant, Slime Coated Harpoon, 4) Cobalt Gaunts and Rothyl&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Channeling Crystal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>
&gt; Xegony<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not a huge milestone anymore, but one for me, nonetheless.... DING 50!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has ANYONE seen this drop. I don&#39;t want to hear stories. I<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was camping The Kly this weekend, and saw NOTHING but a<br/>
&gt; &gt; silly helm. Lore no less.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have heard rumors from it being removed, being made the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rare drop, to being moved to The Hole. Can anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; substantiate where this item is anymore?<br/>
