<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016822781">Actually, I have NO idea WHEN Chainmail came about originally... All I know is I was started playing it a few years before the D&D red box came out. And come to think of it, her books WERE kind of ratty looking.  Maybe my old DM had them for some time. We never used the table-top miniature rules because we played in a friggin TREEHOUSE of all places and it was really cramped. Heh.<br/>

     &#39;Chainmail&#39; eh..  more like 25 yeas if my aged memory serves me right. <br/>
      Actually wasn&#39;t chainmail a set of fantasy miniature rules that <br/>
     pre-dated  D&D by a couple of years and is reputed to  have helped <br/>
     inspired D&D?  That would be more like 30 years...  (gosh Chainmail <br/>
     isn&#39;t in my spell checker..  the nerve)<br/>

Dwarf in the sewers?  By the blood of Greyhawk! Was that you I saw with that <br/>
pack of wererats following you?<br/>
Been RP&#39;ing for 17 years. Ewwww. Am I geeked up or what? Been playing since <br/>
the *Chainmail* days. For those of you who don&#39;t know what Chainmail is, its <br/>
those little light brown paper backs Gary Gygax (curse him) made pre-D&D <br/>
boxed sets.<br/>

&gt;&gt;The problem with this is that it is another generalization granted there <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;&gt;a lot of kewldudes, and a lot of them are teenagers but not all of them <br/>
&gt;&gt;there are some adults that fit into that category. The only problem with <br/>
