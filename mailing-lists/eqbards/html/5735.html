<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The real problem Verant is trying to solve is kiting.  They think its a<br/>
&gt;problem, so for the sake of argument lets assume it is for a moment.  The<br/>
&gt;major effect of kiting is that it allows you to combat monsters you normally<br/>
&gt;could not, with little risk.  The main objective is to put that risk factor<br/>
&gt;back in, not to make it impossible.  This could be accomplished very easily.<br/>
&gt;If they set DOT&#39;s to only do damage when a monster is within a certain<br/>
&gt;range, kiting would still be possible, but more risky.  If they make the<br/>
&gt;effective range twice the range of the melee attack of the critter, I would<br/>
&gt;think they would achieve their goal.  Sure you could run around with a<br/>
&gt;critter on you and kite, but one misstep, one hit tree, one bit of lag and<br/>
&gt;the critter will get a swing, proabably a bash, and if he stuns you?  Well<br/>
&gt;we all know the result of getting stunned by a deep red, death.  <br/>

never take hits.  I agree with the idea of solving it - but what I think is<br/>
that they should instead change it to make DoTs more easily resisted by<br/>
deep reds.  In fact, DoTs should be pretty much impossible to affect a deep<br/>
red, really hard for red, and kinda tough for yellow.  (Sorta like Melee<br/>
weapons are, y&#39;know?)<br/>

My Opinion, your milage may vary.<br/>
