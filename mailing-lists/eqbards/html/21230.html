<div id="ygrps-yiv-607670354">The song works fine.  It gives no message and no sound.  If you watch you<br/>
will see a faint blue glow around the mob when you sing it.  I have about<br/>
80% success with dropping dmg shields on the first try with this song.  And<br/>
rarely have I had to sing more than 2 or 3 pulses to get rid of them.<br/>
Target yourself after someone buffs you and sing it (it will NOT work on<br/>
another player unless you&#39;re duelling).  You will have to have them re-buff<br/>
you afterwards though ;)<br/>

The song works fine.  I use it all the time.  If I&#39;m in a dungeon where I<br/>
can expect lots of dmg shields on mobs I always keep it memmed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Easy enough to test.  Get a friend (caster hopefully) and have him cast<br/>
&gt; every buff he has on himself.  Keep hitting him with the song and see what<br/>
&gt; happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems to me I never get a message when i use the song.  No dispel, no<br/>
&gt; resist, just nothing happens.  Is there some trick to the song?<br/>
