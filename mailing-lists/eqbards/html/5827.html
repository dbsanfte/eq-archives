Thanks for the good tips! <br/>
<br/>
From my short bit of time there, I can see you need a good group and each<br/>
one needs to do his job.  I have already seen shaman who forgets to heal the<br/>
warrior in combat but dumps his mana with heals after combat while Hymm is<br/>
playing - just young I guess.  And the druid who wont melee and leaves as<br/>
soon as he dings - just a weenie I guess.  Others who ask for SoW after I<br/>
explain that Selo&#39;s will unroot them but will cancel SoW, etc. etc.  You<br/>
need know how to assist and how to deal with multiple mob fights. BTW: I am<br/>
just dying to try the Lullaby with a Lute in there - but think I&#39;ll do it<br/>
right near the zone the first time. <br/>
<br/>
So, I think another key is to gather a party with the correct levels - not<br/>
for xp distribution so much as for taking collateral damage.  Tanks can be<br/>
younger - casters and bards need to be older - just so they can last thru a<br/>
couple hard hitting rounds during the beginning of an evac and run for the<br/>
zone when they get mobbed by the bad stuff they cant fight. Skel Monk? wtf??<br/>
who invited him? ZONE!<br/>
<br/>
So far we have not done rooms - we sit by the wall and pull from back<br/>
door/side door.  We tried to hold the side room but highers were pulling<br/>
stuff thru our room and we got chased out.  So far we been working yard<br/>
trash and ghouls and dry bones we can pull. Guess those all are yard trash<br/>
to highers.<br/>
<br/>
One of the last pulls of the night was one of the best - we got mobbed by<br/>
too much stuff!  But this time everyone heeded the ZONE call and our ranger<br/>
even yelled ROOTED so I could fire up Selos and break him loose.  I tried to<br/>
stay right behind everyone as we ran for the zone.  Everyone lived! Finally<br/>
felt like the team was a team.<br/>

		I have almost lived in Unrest from levels 14-24.  Yes this<br/>
place can be<br/>
		exciting, but it can be quite tedious at times.  As bard<br/>
there are<br/>
		actually very few items that you will really want in here.<br/>
Mostly the BS<br/>
		mantl and BS Tunic unless you are a wood elf, then small<br/>
bronze looks<br/>
		quite attractive.   After many successful and unsuccessful<br/>
campaigns in<br/>
		Unrest I have found  that the following group make up<br/>
provides the<br/>
		greatest balance while holding a room.<br/>
<br/>
		I find that <br/>
		2 tanks (warrior, monk, ranger, paladin, shadowknight)<br/>
		1 bard <br/>
		2 cleric<br/>
		1 DD caster<br/>
<br/>
		Whenever I get a group like this holding a room like the<br/>
Ghoul Magi room,<br/>
		Hand room or the Barrom is quite easy.  Once you get your<br/>
level 23 things<br/>
		get better because you are able to stop the runners if you<br/>
have no ranger<br/>
		or Druid.  Hope you have fun in there =).<br/>
