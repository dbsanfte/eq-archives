<div id="ygrps-yiv-264508708">Have to second Donny Dane on the drivers and ME.  I think I posted this once<br/>
back when ME came out too.<br/>
<br/>
ME grafted in a lot of Microsoft&#39;s NT OS in its kernel code.  Err .. what<br/>
this means for those of you that don&#39;t develop OS&#39;s - if the driver<br/>
manufacturer had written drivers for Microsoft NT, then they had a BIG jump<br/>
on getting good drivers for Microsoft Windows ME.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft&#39;s windows kernel code is notoriously buggy (NT less so than 98),<br/>
as well, as per licensing agreements, they release documentation only at<br/>
certain levels of &quot;partnership&quot; (read you sign successively stronger<br/>
anti-compete clauses to get to learn which parts of MS&#39;s code works best).<br/>
So as well, larger companies who already signed these agreements will have<br/>
more documentation available.  And if they signed said &quot;partnerships&quot; while<br/>
writing NT drivers - they&#39;ll have had good existing code that would take<br/>
little time to make into ME drivers of decent quality.<br/>
<br/>
So for a consumer, if the company writing your drivers isn&#39;t big enough (or<br/>
oriented to MS enough) to have signed their &quot;partnership&quot; agreements - AS<br/>
WELL as having a large enough market to have had prior Windows NT drivers<br/>
for thier hardware ... don&#39;t even bother - stay in 98 SE.<br/>
