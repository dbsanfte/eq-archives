<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928151731">1. Three without losing any effects, sometimes four with one effect<br/>
dropping for a few seconds<br/>
2. It works best if you hotkey every song you want to play, and instead<br/>
of looking at them to see if you can click song number 2 yet, just let<br/>
yourself fall into the rythm of it.<br/>
3. For battle it&#39;s anthem, chords and hymn; sometimes subsituting in<br/>
elemental rhythms if I don&#39;t need healing or dot. Solo battle I usually<br/>
twist anthem, warsong, and hymn, dropping hymn for a pulse of chords<br/>
once in a while. Out of battle I&#39;d rather not be twisting, my fingers<br/>
need a rest and I like to chat, so I&#39;ll just leave hymn going. When<br/>
travelling I just put in the drum and play selo&#39;s, maybe twisting it<br/>
with one of the buff songs for some extra str when I&#39;m encumbered.<br/>

&gt; &gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I<br/>
&gt; turn the<br/>
&gt; &gt;clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent<br/>
&gt; trade off<br/>
&gt; &gt;in viewable distance and twisting time.<br/>

&gt; Okay - to start another, on-topic, thread, I wanted to know a bit<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; your success with &quot;twisting&quot; songs.<br/>
&gt; 1) How many songs can you twist at once - assuming constant effect<br/>
&gt; songs.<br/>
&gt; 2) What do you do to optimize your twisting?<br/>
&gt; 3) What is your current playlist?  What do you sing in battle, and<br/>
&gt; what out<br/>
&gt; of it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a few questions from a young-again bard<br/>
