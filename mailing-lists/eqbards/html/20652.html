<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839881056">Does anyone know exactly how defense works? Either it just raises very very<br/>
slowly or if your raw AC is very high for your level *cough*twink*cough*,<br/>
despite that you take damage, your defense may not raise. If this is the<br/>
case, it is a great anti-twinking measure.<br/>
