<b>Subject:</b> Button Quest or &quot;Death to Twisting&quot; or How to make Bards more Fun or  Please improve the interface! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-293047019">I play multiple songs most of the time now.  That goes for between battles<br/>
(Clarity and Restoration) as well as in battles (usually 3, but sometimes 4)<br/>
and my fingers are tired.  The buttons on my keyboard are wearing out.  My<br/>
eyes are sore from reading all the darn messages which provide the most<br/>
reliable clue for me to begin the next song.  So besides whining about it,<br/>
what is my point?  I want a new, intelligent client interface!  I want to<br/>
select multiple songs to weave/twist/dicombobulate/phase-shift-modulate and<br/>
then I want to fight and watch the awesome graphics the game provides.    <br/>
<br/>
I know the interface will not support this right now.  The interface treats<br/>
bards like casters, but that does not mean they can&#39;t alter the interface to<br/>
accomodate this request.  Add a Harmony Ability (See Definitions below, esp<br/>
#4a, courtesy of Meriam Webster&#39;s Online Dictionary).  This &quot;Harmony&quot;<br/>
Ability could take the form of a button on the Abilities menu.  The Bard<br/>
pushes the &quot;Harmony&quot; button and then depresses multiple songs in the order<br/>
the Bard wants to play them.  The Server then starts each song and<br/>
immediately shifts to the next song until the list is completed and then<br/>
returns to the top of the queue.  To stop the auto-playing of songs, hit the<br/>
&quot;Harmony&quot; button and resume manual control.  Simple enough?  The idea is not<br/>
without precedent.  [The auto-attack feature of the game is a similar form<br/>
of redundancy elimination (which could also be enhanced, similarly to what<br/>
is suggested here, to include special attacks like kick or bash or the<br/>
myriad Monk abilities).]  There will be some resistance, perhaps even<br/>
philosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that<br/>
this change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>
<br/>
This will make the game more fun.  This will make the game much more<br/>
relaxing to play.  This will also make things much more fair for Bards that<br/>
do not have an excellent internet connection and/or the good fortune to live<br/>
in San Diego (I have a very, very fast DSL connection and can easily weave 3<br/>
songs and almost 4, while I have spoken to many bards that usually can&#39;t<br/>
manage more than 2).<br/>
