<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951100169">My fav: when I discovered my 50 or so lock pick skill was enough to open the <br/>
door at the hole.  I started spamming every rogue I knew.  Those guys sure <br/>
know how to swear.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I came out of lurking to ask: anyone know what lvl 60 bard title is?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I canceled my account back in August, but still lurk as I enjoy <br/>
keeping track of people I have come to know/watching verant screw my class <br/>
of choice.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to ring in my support for all those who choose to take the <br/>
picket lines with me.<br/>
<br/>
Now just waiting for Dawn/Horizons/SB/etc. to come out.<br/>
