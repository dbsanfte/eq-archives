LGuk it&#39;s usually 2 or 3 paladins with ghoulbanes, a warrior<br/>
with an executioner&#39;s axe, and a ranger with various procing<br/>
weapons.  Since I&#39;m usually doing crowd control or buffing<br/>
resists, I&#39;m not using my weapons anyway, so (on the dead<br/>
side) I usually use Chant of Battle (with drum) instead of<br/>
Celerity.  Those weapons proc a lot more, usually 2-3 times a<br/>
fight each (and a couple extra procs from ghoulbane pretty<br/>
much equals the damage I could do with my weapons).  Of course<br/>
if I can spare the song slot, I use both.  And on the live<br/>
side I usually prefer Celerity and join in the fighting.<br/>
