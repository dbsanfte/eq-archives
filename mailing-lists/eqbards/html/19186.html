<div id="ygrps-yiv-440300565">There was a poetry scene developing on Rallos Zek when I was there in the<br/>
days before faction. The RP community there had a lot of good folks in it.<br/>
One of it&#39;s stars was a Troll Bard, well, she was quite sure she was a bard,<br/>
despite that her songs had different effects than the meat pie bards, to<br/>
wit, mostly they worked like Anglich&#39;s Appalling Screech.<br/>
<br/>
What follows is some historical information on the time that I just dug up<br/>
while looking through old files.<br/>
<br/>
From the pen of Tsengu, Cleric of Innorruk, Rallos Zek<br/>
<br/>
I went to Grobbe as an ambassador of Dark Unity and, as a side effort, to<br/>
introduce the Trolls to more refined culture, that is, Teir&#39;Dal culture.<br/>
Both efforts met with great success, and as part of the second effort I<br/>
spent some time teaching our Troll brethren and sistren the finer arts.<br/>
Despite that it is considered the most refined of the Teir&#39;Dal poetry forms,<br/>
it was the haiku that was greeted most enthusiastically. What follows are<br/>
poems I wrote on my missionary travels, please consider the audience for<br/>
which they were intended and that their purpose was to entice our Dark<br/>
Allies from the immediacy of their cultural interests.<br/>
<br/>
A quick note, Daowin was a Human Paladin of some renown, bringing great<br/>
havoc to The Nektulos and The Innothule when he was only of third rank.He<br/>
was highly respected and feared as well as, of course, hated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Innothule Haiku<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Hint to the Shaman<br/>
Blindness found in Neriak<br/>
Third Gate, need Elf help<br/>
<br/>
Oozing, gooky mud<br/>
As far as the eye can see<br/>
Who needs the patchwork?<br/>
<br/>
Froglok meat is nice<br/>

Flies bite it not you<br/>
<br/>
Skellie he go ha<br/>
he go ha ha ha ha ha<br/>
deez chips hurt my gums<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once I returned home I continued to write, however, unfortunate events cut<br/>
my efforts short. They are included here for reference and some solace to<br/>
the pain any Teir&#39;Dal has suffered reading the above.<br/>
<br/>

Resting on the newbie log<br/>
