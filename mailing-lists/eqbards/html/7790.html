<div id="ygrps-yiv-191807538">I agree with this... I finally understand why the melee types don&#39;t get<br/>
bind/gate.  It&#39;s due largely to the fact that they have so many HPs that<br/>
they can (usually) make it to zone w/o dying.  I was in Mistmoore last<br/>
weekend and it was the same story.  Train comes... casters gate... melee&#39;ers<br/>
run to zone.  The melee types almost always made it out (as with the<br/>
casters).  Also, it took the melee&#39;ers to fight down to the corpses to do a<br/>
recovery (if it was needed).  Bards don&#39;t get it for two reasons : With<br/>
Accelerando and Drum you can get to any zone from any other zone in a<br/>
relatively short amount of time.  I can go cross continent in under 40<br/>
minutes... usually it&#39;s no longer than 15 minutes.  With our Invis song, we<br/>
can get-into and get-out-of places that the other classes couldn&#39;t dream of<br/>
(again, I&#39;ll use Mistmoore as my example.  Druid invis did nothing for us..<br/>
even the wimpy MOBs could see right through it.  Finally I memmed Clouding<br/>
and was able to get two corpses out unscathed).<br/>
<br/>
I personally think bind/gate would be unbalancing for bards.  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong, I wouldn&#39;t complain if we got it, but it would be too powerful (IMO).<br/>
<br/>
After all, the whole point of this game is to NOT DIE (when I think back on<br/>
all my deaths, 80% of them could have been prevented or were caused by a<br/>
boneheaded maneuver on my or a group members part).<br/>

A melee class that depends completely on their armor<br/>
and weapons, which are now 2-3 zones away on their<br/>
corpse. A casting class depends on their spells which<br/>
are on them at ALL times no matter where they are.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s more dangerous for a caster to run 2-3 zones<br/>
away completely armed with their weapons (spells) and<br/>
their shields (spells), and less dangerous for a melee<br/>
class to make the same run with no weapons and no<br/>
armor at all.<br/>
<br/>
Please explain that again. I think I missed something.<br/>

Very happy to explain.  When you run back to get your body, presumably you<br/>
are avoiding all mobs that may give you trouble.  So if you do get into<br/>
trouble, it is generally coming from something that you didn&#39;t see and has<br/>
already started hitting you.  Since it came after you, it is at least high<br/>
green, and likely higher.<br/>
<br/>
A bard should have turbo going already and should have no trouble outrunning<br/>
pursuit.  You might have me with a rogue.  They should be hiding/sneaking<br/>
through trouble spots, but a random encounter spells disaster for them.<br/>
I&#39;ve never played one, though, so they may have a trick up their sleeves for<br/>
just such a predicament.<br/>
<br/>
A caster with spells memorized will probably start by trying to cast root<br/>
(if they have it), which takes a bit of time to cast.  Some of the time<br/>
(depending on the level of the mob -- if it&#39;s white or higher you&#39;re<br/>
probably screwed regardless of class) you can get it off in your first<br/>
couple of tries and make a run for it.  All too often, however, you get<br/>
repeatedly interrupted until you are either dead or too weak to make it to<br/>
the zone before the mob gets loose and comes after you again.  That lack of<br/>
hps really shows in this situation; it doesn&#39;t take many hits to pound a<br/>
caster six feet under.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it this way: a caster&#39;s armor is his/her group -- especially as<br/>
the caster advances in levels.  Without that group, combat generally leads<br/>
directly to death.  If a caster has the luxury of picking his/her prey, they<br/>
can often have some success, but when combat is initiated by the mob, my<br/>
experience shows that the caster is going to lose.<br/>
<br/>
A fighting melee class (PAL, RNG, SK, WAR), on the other hand, if he/she was<br/>
smart enough to pick up that spare weapon he/she keeps in the bank (my lvl<br/>
16 TSK and 9 Ranger always keep a spare for difficult retrievals), can fend<br/>
off greens and most blues, even sans armor.  If things look really bad,<br/>
having several more hps than casters gives the melee player a better chance<br/>
of making it to the zone before giving up the ghost.  Again, if you&#39;ve got a<br/>
high-level mob on your backside, you&#39;re probably dead, but you would have<br/>
been dead fully dressed and with a smile anyway.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels, your solo ability is reduced, but there are FAR fewer mobs<br/>
in most zones that would even consider taking a shot at you, and those can<br/>
mostly be avoided.  <br/>
<br/>
Understand my point now?<br/>
