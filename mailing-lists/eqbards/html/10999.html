&gt; &gt;This was reported to the list yesterday mornin - after the patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Veeshan went down last night - and there happened to be GMs in channel - so<br/>
&gt; &gt;take this for what&#39;s it&#39;s work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: To GM - fippy    Bards levitate seems to only work for 3 tics after a<br/>
&gt; &gt;pulse, does not continue, and you have to land before it can be restarted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Secret Nerf - or unintended bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Unintended bug - it&#39;s amazing what can break.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It should have said it&#39;s amazing what can break when you don&#39;t care enough<br/>
&gt; about a class to test changes to it even to the level of &quot;targeting a bat in<br/>
&gt; a newbie zone&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Greetings,<br/>
&gt; &gt;first allow me to introduce myself.  I am new to this list, but not a new<br/>
&gt; bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a<br/>
&gt; hurry to level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level 31<br/>
&gt; song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>
&gt; message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>
&gt; floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>
&gt; the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>
&gt; cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>
&gt; that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>
&gt; just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did<br/>
&gt; not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>
&gt; this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>
