&gt; There&#39;s a quest to return a purity belt stolen by the pirates<br/>
&gt; one island over.  They are L15-19ish from what I saw, but<br/>
&gt; grouped.  Probably shouldn&#39;t attempt it with a full group in<br/>
&gt; their 20s (since you can&#39;t run to a zone in the OOT).  Instead<br/>
&gt; of returning the belt to complete the quest, you could always<br/>
&gt; keep it.  Talk to the head Sister of Erollisi.<br/>

Actually, the stolen item isn&#39;t a purity belt, it&#39;s the Bracer of Erollisi, a<br/>
leather wristband that gives +5 strength - a really nice item.  Wearable by all<br/>
leather wearing classes except shadowknights I believe. It&#39;s on Captain<br/>
Stoutheart, a mean little halfling who lives in a pup tent on Gornit&#39;s island.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN turn the bracer in for faction and an item (usually something like a steel<br/>
broadsword), but usually, if you can manage to get the item, you generally want to<br/>
keep it or sell it.   The item is LORE, so you can&#39;t have one to wear and one to<br/>
sell/turn in.<br/>
<br/>
The pirates, btw, aren&#39;t really &quot;evil&quot;, they&#39;re just aligned differently than the<br/>
wood elves.  Killing one will lower your faction with the pirates and with<br/>
Fizzlethorpe, the god of mischief.  Most bards won&#39;t care about this, but halfling<br/>
clerics probably would.<br/>
