Can we stop talking about days played?  If I have to look mine up I will be<br/>
depressed for weeks!<br/>
*giggles*  But I agree the twink factor and the general &quot;know how to play<br/>
the game&quot; factor really help ...<br/>

&gt; there&#39;s also the twink factor...  the paladin can pay for a <br/>
&gt; full set of gear<br/>
&gt; for the necro.  so the necro has to struggle alot less as <br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll have more<br/>
&gt; mana/better gear to do his thing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My bard has about 40 days played i guess, maybe more and is <br/>
&gt; still not 50,<br/>
&gt; but my necro was level 50 in 17 days /played... <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; there are a few reasons this is and a few more why it would have been<br/>
&gt; exacerbated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  experience penalty.  paladin has 40%, necro has (i believe) 10%.<br/>
&gt; 2.  necro can solo much more easily than a paladin.  how much <br/>
&gt; of those 128<br/>
&gt; days were<br/>
&gt;       spent looking for a group?<br/>
&gt; 3.  did he work on any trade skills like blacksmithing for <br/>
&gt; his class armor?<br/>
&gt; these types of <br/>
&gt;       things are very time consuming.<br/>
&gt; 4.  the paladin would likely have spent most of his hunting <br/>
&gt; times in groups,<br/>
&gt; which, unless it<br/>
&gt;       is a very good group in an uncrowded area, will not <br/>
&gt; equate to the<br/>
&gt; speed of soloing.  if you <br/>
&gt;       are in a group camping frenzy when there are 80 other <br/>
&gt; people in lower<br/>
&gt; guk, you will not be<br/>
&gt;       nonstop killing.  if you are fear kiting stuff in <br/>
&gt; dreadlands solo you<br/>
&gt; will be non stop killing (due<br/>
&gt;       to number of available mobs)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s probably other reasons like the time it takes to run <br/>
&gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; paladin&#39;s corpse, while the<br/>
&gt; necro can just bind where he is fighting.  or perhaps now <br/>
&gt; that the paladin<br/>
&gt; knows where a lot of the<br/>
&gt; good places to hunt are, he knows exactly where to take the <br/>
&gt; necro for the<br/>
&gt; best experience.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Here&#39;s what a friend of ours said about the two classes he&#39;s played:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;[The paladin] is lvl 54 now with 128 days played and well over 18 <br/>
&gt; &gt;months of hard core gaming. Sure he died quite a few times <br/>
&gt; and many of them<br/>
&gt; &gt;before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days <br/>
&gt; with very little<br/>
&gt; &gt;exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand <br/>
&gt; has officially<br/>
&gt; &gt;passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, <br/>
&gt; 4 of those<br/>
&gt; &gt;camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, <br/>
&gt; which cutts<br/>
&gt; exp<br/>
&gt; &gt;in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go <br/>
&gt; from 1 to 54 for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the <br/>
&gt; pally. How can this<br/>
&gt; &gt;be right?<br/>
&gt; &gt;*********************<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s not just bards that have issues. I will really hate the loss of<br/>
&gt; mezzing<br/>
&gt; &gt;and CCing things and see it as a major impact on my ability <br/>
&gt; to contribute<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;group survival/success.<br/>
