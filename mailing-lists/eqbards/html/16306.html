<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And sure enough, (I have the eqlog.txt to prove it) I had 230 CR,<br/>
  my all time record high but still got waxxed.  It&#39;s _very_ hard to <br/>
  beat 230 cold. In fact it&#39;s near impossible to go above 250.<br/>
<br/>
  2390 hp.<br/>
<br/>
  Vox breath attack one:   0.5  bubbles.<br/>
  Vox breath attack two:   1.5  bubbles.<br/>
  Vox breath attack three: 0.25 bubbles.<br/>
  Vox breath attack four:  1.5  bubbles.<br/>
  Vox breath attack five:  dead.  (thats right: 2+ bubbles)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll post my eqlog.txt when I get home.... it clearly shows this:<br/>
<br/>
  You feel an aura of elemental protection.<br/>
  Your aura fades.<br/>
  You are blasted by freezing winds.<br/>
<br/>
  wtf?  There is a bug with Bard Song Shields and I now have the log<br/>
  to prove it.  And you all dismissed it as lunacy ;)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	A little CR, pause for a snack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  We terrorized gfay in the downtime.  We had punching duels.  (I lost<br/>
  mine, don&#39;t ever duel a ranger in a punching contest even with their<br/>
  low H2H skill, he was double/dualing 5-9 dmg consistant enough that<br/>
  my weak dual couldn&#39;t keep up. Plus he kicked me a lot, damn cheater.<br/>
  heh.  That&#39;s ok, I was playing VoV ;-)  Got him to a sliver and died)<br/>
<br/>
  There were trolls molesting ogres who in turn were molesting wood elves.<br/>
  It was actually some of the best times I&#39;ve had after dying in a while.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Harmonic came along as a guest this trip, so he got to see both<br/>
&gt; the guild at its worst and best :).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Had more fun than I have had in a long time.  Losing was fun, and<br/>
  so was winning.  I have screenshots, but I didn&#39;t know whether you<br/>
  all wanted them posted or not, so I just put them in my eq resume <br/>
  folder ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  Killed Maestro the other night too, finally got my evensong after<br/>
  the first one was ninja looted from me months ago.  He was dual<br/>
  wielding, 24 people killed him with 3-4 deaths.  Learned a lot<br/>
  about how to fight him after the first attempt with 32 people<br/>
  failed miserably.  32 people with his AE lifetap actually made<br/>
  his hp go up, not down in battle.  Scary.  Cleared 5-6 static<br/>
  houses (20-30 mobs) and one thing dropped, EM gloves.  That is<br/>
  another great example of Verant under-rewarding players who&#39;ve<br/>
  invested time into _their_ world.<br/>
<br/>
  Psalm of Vitality does not cure disease.  If anyone wants my eqlog<br/>
  of that I pulsed it for 1 hour, and Strong Disease was still up<br/>
  when I returned to the computer.  This applies to Psalm of Purity<br/>
  as well.  It does not cure poison (although poison is much shorter<br/>
  duration).<br/>
<br/>
  I tested a few other things as well, but I failed to test charm<br/>
  again.  It could have been a fluke in permafrost, but I could<br/>
  not clear the dmg list of any of the 3 goblins I tried it on.<br/>
  I&#39;ll try it again this weekend, on the mobs I use to powerlevel<br/>
  people (centaurs).<br/>
<br/>
  But there is absolutely something wrong with our magical song shields,<br/>
  and I encourage others to test this against NPC spell casters.  If<br/>
  I can later today at work during lunch, I&#39;ll log something to post<br/>
  this bug.<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
