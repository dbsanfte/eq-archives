nowhere what it was at level 18 even.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;classes?  none.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, bingo!  The only groups I get into are with guildmates/friends!  I<br/>
spent 3 hours in Mistmoore looking for a group, there were 3 groups of lvls<br/>
28-25 and none of them wanted a bard once they found out I didn&#39;t have<br/>
manasong.  One guy in the 34-35 group said I was too low, while a different<br/>
one in the same group replied that I was too close to a hell level and he<br/>
was afraid I&#39;d fall back into it if I joined them.  Both after learning I<br/>
wasn&#39;t 32nd yet.  Rangers are highly desireable in any dungeon for Snare,<br/>
warriors for their superior tanking ability.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well you must have a different client than everyone else then.  I would take<br/>
my experiences plus Kaearia&#39;s (John Kim) data over your supposed never<br/>
having problems in a heartbeat.  Psalm is never useful enough to be the song<br/>
of choice.  fear is suicide, a run away tactic at best in a group.  Anthem<br/>
is useless if there&#39;s an enchanter in the group, and since they are so<br/>
necessary there nearly always is, especially with 3 in my group of<br/>
guildmates/friends.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;you never chain unless alone?  maybe you just don&#39;t understand the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>flexibility<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of a bard then.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s a good one.  that your best debating technique?  I do understand the<br/>
flexibility and 12 seconds of inferior snaring is nowhere near as good as a<br/>
first level druid or ninth level ranger spell, SNARE.  Not even close.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t stack with Largo&#39;s and Largo&#39;s doesn&#39;t break Snare like it does.  I<br/>
cannot remember the last time I was in a group without a ranger or a druid.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;use a wind instrument when using pixie?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally I don&#39;t use a wind instrument since it makes zero difference on<br/>
the resist rate, as tested extensively by myself and John Kim.  My charisma<br/>
can be 153 or 119 depending on gear.  I liked doing more than just laying<br/>
DoT&#39;s with instruments and playing Hymn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;existed.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>

<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a lot about our songs and the way the game works and other classes before<br/>

 </span></blockquote>enough or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;don&#39;t have enough knowledge to really master the bard class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>More of that good debating technique?  I disagree with you so obviously I am<br/>
incompetent?  Our power is not nicely masked.  We can reduce downtime.  We<br/>
can make other classes more fun for them to play.  Of course the fact that<br/>
we can do most of this without ever doing anything but standing in a corner<br/>
the casters can run to when they need our song must be the mastery part you<br/>
mentioned. &lt;sarcasm intended&gt;<br/>
Is our class useless?  No, neither is any other class.  Does our class<br/>
really have anything that defines it?  No, we just run real fast and twiddle<br/>
our fingers a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the one without knowledge is you?  I can play my druid who is several<br/>
levels below my bard and take on the same mobs.  Get into a group?  No<br/>
problem, everyone loves SoW.  My druid can still solo yellows without<br/>
kiting?  My bard can try that with charm, but one bad lag spot and it&#39;s the<br/>
poor man&#39;s Gate for me.  My druid group regularly slaughters reds that my<br/>
bard wouldn&#39;t touch since the resists would be too high for him to be<br/>
effective.  My enchanter is even more of a joke.  I get begged to be in<br/>
groups.  I have to turn people down all the time.  Not to mention I can<br/>
actually feel like I pulled my weight.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m the most cynical pessimistic person you have ever met you don&#39;t get<br/>
out enough.<br/>
