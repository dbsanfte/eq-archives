<div id="ygrps-yiv-72848165">This last dragon buff was done in reaction to an exploit (well, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
an exploit or maybe it&#39;s a techique - hard to say.)  And in a way that only<br/>
Verant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>
the same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>
stop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>
than 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>
icons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>
adventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>
&#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>
<br/>
So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>
whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>
20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
<br/>
But anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>
will be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>
different from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>
have new tactics.  I think you will have great fun when you time comes.<br/>

&gt; This is a small thing, but part of a bigger problem.  Dragons been made<br/>
&gt; harder, I see they&#39;re thinking.  Certain guild have gotten really good<br/>
&gt; at killing them and its become easy.  What happens in June of 2045 when<br/>
&gt; my guild is ready to take on a dragon for the first time?  We wont have<br/>
&gt; a shot in hell. </span></blockquote></div>
