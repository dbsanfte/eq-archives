<div id="ygrps-yiv-162623818">What i do, which is sometimes painfull, is find 1 giant, get him to aggro me<br/>
whichever way i want. then i&#39;ll run him by another giant which will then<br/>
join the marathon. so now i have my 2 giants after my blueberry butt that is<br/>
very selo&#39;d. Next step run them to where you want them to fight. Next, charm<br/>
one (he&#39;ll start running away for some dumb reason and wont attack the<br/>
other) turn around and run right at the non charmed giant. Voila, you now<br/>
have a very pissed off pet attacking another giant, keep Selo&#39;s on, your<br/>
charm is gonna let go soon and you&#39;re near 2 giants because you just charged<br/>
one.  Charm lets go, charm again, selo, heal, selo, recharm, selo, keep<br/>
charming like this untill one is dead, the other will be very weak and chant<br/>
it to death. Go find 2 more targets. At most HP you&#39;ll lose when charging<br/>
the giant is 1 bub of hp (you might sweat abit if you&#39;re stunned) But i&#39;ve<br/>
finished alot of them with a bub of hp and didnt fear for my life. Even the<br/>
group next to me was sending me tells asking if they wanted me to take one<br/>
because they saw my low health, i was like hell no if you do i&#39;ll be kiting<br/>
for an hour. But most of the time i will have 2 dead giants and be full<br/>
health. Hope this helps<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Charming Giants<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got a question for you guys who do alot of Giant charming.  I seem to have a<br/>
particulary hard time getting them targeted on each other. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
My general charm tactics are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
-	find a critter, charm it, fire up selos and start looking for an<br/>
opponent<br/>
- 	find an opponent, recharm my pet, re-target the opponent, let my pet<br/>
get real close to me and give it the attack order<br/>
-	Fire selos back up....back off to maximum range..recharm as<br/>
necessary, doing big circles around critters if charm is resisted <br/>
- 	when pet is getting low on health, do a health check....helps if you<br/>
have critters that run when they are low on health..as the<br/>
opponent will run if he is losing<br/>
- 	Either chant kite, fear kite or pull out the weapons and kill the<br/>
remaining critter if health is low enough...or find another target and send<br/>
my pet back into the fray.<br/>
<br/>
My various problems are:<br/>
<br/>
-	my initial charm wears off to soon for my pet to make it to the<br/>
target to attack, so I have to redo the entire charm, get close to pet, tell<br/>
it to attack etc.<br/>
-	both critters run at me, the pet is behind the target and the target<br/>
keeps running at me instead of turning to fight my pet<br/>
-	targeting in general.  F8 targets the closest hostile, but what if<br/>
both are uncharmed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or do I just need to practice more?<br/>
