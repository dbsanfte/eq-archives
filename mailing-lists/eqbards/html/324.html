<div id="ygrps-yiv-289781673">I hate the way people accuse, point fingers, and almost foam at the mouth<br/>
whenever they feel the slightest injustice has been done to them.  Mellow<br/>
out man!  Ask first, see whats going on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a Soerbaird, but I&#39;ve been paying attention.  As I understand it<br/>
they are still relatively new, and are still compiling these song lists and<br/>
help sections.  They are probably focusing more on in game help for now,<br/>
until they can compile more in-depth song lists etc.  Why would they bother<br/>
to re-hash the same information on bards you can get 100 other places on the<br/>
web?  They can&#39;t help you without experience, and they can&#39;t get experience<br/>
until they level, and I can&#39;t see that they have enough high level people to<br/>
produce what you are DEMANDING.<br/>
<br/>
Regretfully,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been to the soerbaird site, and it&#39;s very nice looking.<br/>
&gt;You can see lots of bard tales and songs made up by people<br/>
&gt;playing as bards in eq.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However: Please! CORRECT ME IF I&#39;M WRONG!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is all the actual nuts and bolts information you have<br/>
&gt;compiled about bards locked behind passworded sections<br/>
&gt;marked &quot;Members Only&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I may be an idiot and unable to find the information I am<br/>
&gt;actually interested in (specific tactics, song effects,<br/>
&gt;bard quests, bard only magic items, bard faction information)<br/>
&gt;and if so I apologize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if I am correct that all such information is secreted away,<br/>
&gt;then I have heard enough about the clique known as<br/>
&gt;the soerbairds. If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>
&gt;group and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>
&gt;to yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>
&gt;name of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>
&gt;that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>
&gt;public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>
&gt;to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I missed a link or something, then I apologize in advance,<br/>
&gt;and long live the soerbaird :P<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hail Roop and bards!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; This was an excellent list indeed. I&#39;m compiling a smilar list for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Soerbaird and love to hear what other bards have done with songs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; One question I pose to all you bards out there: The Charismatic<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Carillon--<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I know a few of you have posted that you use this song, and that it has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; least a minimal affect, but I have not even seen that much. My thinking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; that the song has not yet been giving the blessing of the gods<br/>
&gt;&gt; (it is bugged).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, could some one advise me of the appropriate way to use this song?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I murmur it to myself, or do I serenade the shopkeeper with whom I wish<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; do business? Do I initiate the trade immediately after I sing, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; do I wait<br/>
&gt;&gt; a moment? How long do I have?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would advocate that this song is more effective than it<br/>
&gt;&gt; currently is, for<br/>
&gt;&gt; at the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying. Of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>course,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I am a VERY charming fellow already, and maybe I have found a limit to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; amount dashing good looks can affect purchasing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Listen and Live!<br/>
