<div id="ygrps-yiv-979603238">Like jboots the guise&#39;s effect can be activated by anyone & you needn&#39;t be<br/>
wearing it.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually a large annoyance I have with these items, if people<br/>
actually had to wear jboots for them to work, they&#39;d be in ALOT less demand<br/>
as the AC on them is pretty low.  Also getting a guise for a rogue or bard<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be as hard.<br/>
<br/>
NoDrops can&#39;t be traded, dropped or even banked (which is extremely silly).<br/>
As a result yes, if someone loots it, they&#39;re stuck with it.  The only way<br/>
to get rid of it is to destroy it.<br/>

&gt;I have a couple of questions about this magic item.  First, according to<br/>
&gt;screenshots on a couple EQ sites, it says the Guise is for bards and rogues<br/>
&gt;only.  Is this still true?  I ran into a barbarian once who had one on.  He<br/>
&gt;used it to make him smaller so he could get into tight places.  I&#39;m almost<br/>
&gt;certain he was a warrior (I did a /who on him).  Second question is the NO<br/>
&gt;DROP flag.  The screenshots I saw listed it as a NO DROP item.  I don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;much experience with NO DROP items so not certain how this works.  If<br/>
&gt;someone has one can I buy it from them?  What if someone who can&#39;t equip it<br/>
&gt;loots it off the creature that drops it? Does that mean it is forever<br/>
&gt;unusable?  Last question, if it can be sold/traded, what is the fair price<br/>
&gt;for it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
