<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325078525">I tried this but to no avail, the problem was that the merchant was the 1st<br/>
ogre in Oggok as you zone in. He must of had soooo many things sold to him.<br/>
I spent 200pp trying to get it back but no luck. In the end I would have to<br/>
buy back FS weapons at 70pp each so I decided not to do that for the sake<br/>
of the lute.<br/>
