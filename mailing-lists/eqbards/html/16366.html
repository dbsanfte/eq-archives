<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626128168">Very true, if he was really &quot;Sorry about doing this to you guys&quot;  all he<br/>
would do is hit each gnoll with engulphing darkness or something<br/>
similar.  You would get the kills (faster even) and he would get<br/>
faction.  Not to mention it would slow the gnoll&#39;s running (which I<br/>
think those guys do...)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In future, ask the Necromancer to share by throwing a low-level dot on each<br/>
&gt; gnoll.  That way he&#39;ll get faction, your downtime goes down, and everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happy.  That&#39;s what I did with Minos in Steamfont - just one whack gives<br/>
&gt; you faction ;)<br/>
