<div id="ygrps-yiv-832348784">Although I&#39;d love to - I can&#39;t take the credit -- I was the one whining<br/>
about clerics not symbol buffing everyone and said parties should pay<br/>
clerics so they don&#39;t worry about costs -- I do think it was Rokken (or<br/>
Talies? or John?)  who provided the tip of just supplying the gems.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - not just clerics but enchanters can give you a Ruin buff that use gems<br/>
as reagents.  My mid 30ish  enchanter friend was quite happy when I put 20<br/>
jaspers in his trade screen.  And I was quite happy to see &quot;a clops hits YOU<br/>
but your magical skin absorbs the blow&quot; - saves that first bub (absorbs the<br/>
first 250 hps I think) getting fear to stick for the opening of the fight.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s. I was looking for a clops/hg/grifon to pull and decides to clean some<br/>
trash &#39;fawns.  ack I&#39;m  using up my magical skin on a greenie!  and then<br/>
when I looted him -- hehe - yup he dropped a jasper!<br/>

		Another thing - I think it was Sylly a few days back who<br/>
mentioned carrying<br/>
		Jasper and Peridot around with her for the Clerics in her<br/>
groups.  I started<br/>
		doing this, and when I hand them over to the Cleric and<br/>
everyone gets<br/>
		Symboled you&#39;d think *I* was the Cleric.  Man.  If you wanna<br/>
be popular with<br/>
		groups carry Symbol reagents appropriate to your level<br/>
around with you.<br/>
		Very good tip Sylly.</div>
