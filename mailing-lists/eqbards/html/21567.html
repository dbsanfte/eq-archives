I noticed a lot of you are suggesting Collars of Undead Protection and the <br/>
like for the neck slot. I have a hardly used enchanter I have been smithing <br/>
lately with, and one of the new fine steel plate items is the collar which <br/>
is 8 ac...probably the best piece really. Mask is 7 ac but I use the guise <br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
Costwise it is more expensive. Expect to pay anywhere from 80-150p for the <br/>
fine plate, whereas the undead protection is usually closer to 15-30p.<br/>
