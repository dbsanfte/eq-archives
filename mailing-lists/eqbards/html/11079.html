<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398043308">Hehe..  I was thinking I could probably take him down if there were enough normal hill giants in the<br/>
area.  But the question I have to ask is, &quot;Why?&quot;  other than just to say I did it.  :)  I talked to a 45th<br/>
level druid who said he had taken him down in a group, but that he dropped  a fine steel weapon, and 2<br/>
plat.  :)  I&#39;m sure he probably drops something cool.  Probably just not very often.  Is it worth<br/>
sacrificing the exp I&#39;d get from 6 or 7 hill giants to just try and get the 7 plat worth of loot off him?<br/>
:)  Not to mention the huge risk of at some point during all that, making a mistake.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One amusing death I had was against a giant that I tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; to charm, only to realize it wasn&#39;t a normal giant, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; Broog Bloodbeard, which I found out later is around level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 46, and has some 15000hp.  :)  I was so shocked I ran into<br/>
&gt; &gt; a tree, and that&#39;s all she wrote.  He hits for around 130,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and stuns a level 30 player real good.  I went from full<br/>
&gt; &gt; health to death without even being able to move.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He lag-crashed our group of three L40-45 and 6 L24-34 (one<br/>
&gt; moment there was nothing there, next he was on top of us).  To<br/>
&gt; give you an idea how much 15000 hp is, the L45 paladin and I<br/>
&gt; hacked at him for a good 2 minutes while the cleric went OOM<br/>
&gt; keeping us healed.  Broog&#39;s hp bar barely budged.  By this<br/>
&gt; time the others finished off the cyclops (the original<br/>
&gt; pull) and jumped in on Broog.  We went on for another 3<br/>
&gt; minutes or so (mid-30s ranger and monk managed to do some<br/>
&gt; tanking as well).  We took off a total of maybe 1/4 of his hp<br/>
&gt; through all this, then all our healers were OOM, he dropped<br/>
&gt; the paladin, started pounding on me, I ran, and he killed 2<br/>
&gt; more before the others reached the zone.  I lived with 6 hp;<br/>
&gt; apparently a level 40 bard&#39;s Accelerando without a drum is<br/>
&gt; fast enough to outrun him even while walking at 6 hp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The named cyclops in the Ocean of Tears (Queg?) is not quite<br/>
&gt; as bad, and he took 6 of us at L40-46 a good 5 minutes to<br/>
&gt; kill.  Not surprisingly, we got 2gp as loot.<br/>
