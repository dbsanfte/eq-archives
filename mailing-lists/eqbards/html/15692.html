<div id="ygrps-yiv-267013608">Obvious to everyone who actually plays a bard that is, which apparently does<br/>
not include anyone of note at Verant.  This has been my complaint since the<br/>
beginning.  Many of the classes have someone at Verant who really &#39;cares&#39;<br/>
about the class.  As such, those classes are constantly observed for effects<br/>
that changes might have on them and what improvements might be needed for<br/>
them.  Unfortunately, it is all too apparent that bards have no such<br/>
advocate.<br/>

BTW, Been playing my druid a bit more than usual of late due to frustration<br/>
with bard stuff.  Gads do druids have it easy, at least up to 25th level.<br/>
I can&#39;t get over how much easier it is to play my druid than my bard.  If it<br/>
wasn&#39;t for the fact that I really am much more of a bard at heart I&#39;d switch<br/>
over permanently.<br/>

See?  I told you it was good that they fixed the message,<br/>
because it&#39;d make it completely obvious to everyone just how<br/>
high the secondary resist rate was.  :)<br/>
