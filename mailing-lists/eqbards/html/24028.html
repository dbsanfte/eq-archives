I never said it was earth shattering.  I merely am pointing out that<br/>
people<br/>
tend<br/>
to exaggerate the facts when they get something put in their head from<br/>
other<br/>
more vocal people.<br/>
<br/>
and yeah, it was an amazing amount of damage for me compared to how much<br/>
damage i usually do on these things, hehehehe.<br/>
<br/>
and you can&#39;t really discount pvp, it is a part of the game. </span></blockquote></div>
