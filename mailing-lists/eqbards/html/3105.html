<div id="ygrps-yiv-315933174">Hmmm, I have been using harmonizing despite that not being technically<br/>
correct.  The playing of multiple notes at once is polyphany, as in a flute<br/>
is Monophonic, one note at a time, while a piano is polyphonic as it can<br/>
sound multiple notes at once.  Harmonizing using refers to separate<br/>
musicians playing diferent notes on the same rythym, but I can&#39;t offhand<br/>
think of a better term.  I too hate twisting as it brings back memories of<br/>
my entire group once chasing down a lone fleeing mob ala Roop&#39;s story,<br/>
leaving me to handle the other four.  As I said at the time, &quot;What happened,<br/>
you guys left me twisting in the wind!&quot;  They thought it was really funny,<br/>
but I was too irritated at the time to see the humor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As the wordsmiths of Norrath it seems resonable and proper that it should<br/>
fall upon the bards to shape the language.  But can we even shape it among<br/>
ourselves, when speaking of our own unique abilities?<br/>
<br/>
I can only hope.<br/>
<br/>
Can we agree on a word for the interweaving of multiple spellsongs?  Can we<br/>
begin to use it religiously ourselves, first here and then among others?<br/>
Can we change the language of Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
Of the terms so far, I rather like &quot;weaving.&quot;  It has the correct<br/>
denotation and good connotations for blending strands that are similar but<br/>
distinct, to create a fabric that is stronger and more useful than the<br/>
individual strands.  It&#39;s short, clean, and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have the interest and self-discipline to pick a word and effect a<br/>
change?<br/>
<br/>
Today, perhaps, &quot;weaving,&quot; some day, with victories behind us, we can take<br/>
on &quot;proc.&quot;  :-)<br/>
