<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148208681">I did get the Lute but it took Moonflower Bllue some 4 days and 5<br/>
deaths to do it. It didn&#39;t take long in the zone auctioning and &quot;tell&quot;<br/>
to high levels to hear that old refrain &quot;Why sure honey, we just<br/>
destroyed (insert number) of the things because no Bard was around. You<br/>
come and get the next one.&quot; Moon figures she better know the way so<br/>
whips out here lute, through the tunnel, up the ramp and into the<br/>
castle. After a short trip, there is the piano room. No problem. On the<br/>
way back, suddenly &quot;You dare challenge the Might of Mistmoor...&quot;<br/>
&quot;loading.....&quot; Now to make a long story short Moon WAS able to drag her<br/>
body from BETWEEN the LEGS OF A WILL SAPPER&quot; while invis&#39;d. Hands<br/>
shaking she put her stuff in the bank and 3 days later some high levels<br/>
killed a musician at the zone of all places and she got her lute. My<br/>
best guess is that LAG was the culprit in invisibility failing the first<br/>
time but I can&#39;t rule out the Will Sapper being buffed to see<br/>
invisibility one time and not the second.<br/>
   Bad zone ..yes, but for me the scariest is lower Guk. That<br/>
&quot;invisibility&quot; to the dead spell goes down at the darndest times... Moon<br/>
died 3 times yesterday just getting to the executioners room there. Give<br/>
me a song any day !!! and I want an Invis to Undead song now !!!!!  :)<br/>
