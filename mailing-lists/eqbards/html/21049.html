<div id="ygrps-yiv-579001849">necros have a 10 second mez called screaming terror, xcept i know myself<br/>
hate to use it sometimes as it usually makes things very hard to taunt off<br/>
of the necro (being me). though i soemtimes do keep it up and help out the<br/>
chanters till they can get the crowd under control. or a mob is dead. I<br/>
mostly keep it up though instead of root when travelling, since it has a<br/>
chance to whipe the hatelist and is much less resisted then root<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Well, to liven things up, have two questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Can anyone give me some information on the crowd control capabilities <br/>
of classes other than Enchanters and Bards?  Have any of you developed <br/>
any crown control techniques that let you handle oh, say, 5-MOB pulls?  <br/>
I&#39;m really sick to death of hearing &quot;we can&#39;t do that, we have no <br/>
Enchanter&quot;.  Really sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  My guild is toying with the idea of trying Venril Sathir.  I <br/>
understand he has a single-target 1500 point lifetap (repeatable), and <br/>
does 350 or so damage a pop.  The two techniques I&#39;ve seen suggested are: <br/>
 1) chain Rune3ing (new word) the tanks, so the lifetap can&#39;t get them; <br/>
and 2) chain nuking with a big battery of wizards (my suggestion was to <br/>
have a Ranger tanking VS, with all the Clerics chain healing him - should <br/>
be able to keep the guy aggroed enough to allow everyone else to remain <br/>
untouched, don&#39;t you think?)  (slight cynicism here)  My question is, <br/>
does anyone know if poison resist helps against this lifetap the way it <br/>
does against Maestro?  It is reported to be &quot;unresistable&quot;, which I <br/>
suppose is possible, but it may just appear that way because most <br/>
people&#39;s poison resist is pretty low.  Anyone know?<br/>
