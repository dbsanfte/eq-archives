<div id="ygrps-yiv-222757763">I had JUST made level 8 - and at first was pretty annoyed at not having easy<br/>
access to the song.  I found a high level bard to lead me to Kelethin and<br/>
the bard&#39;s guild (he needed the 11th spell).  The trip was long and boring -<br/>
but it gave me an opportunity to practice my lute playing...<br/>
<br/>
After getting the Bard&#39;s guild in Kelethin - confirmed I didn&#39;t have enough<br/>
cash to buy it (which I expected) - so I figure what the hell - I&#39;ll try to<br/>
meet some people and operate out of the area.  I had a great time - met new<br/>
people, saw new sights, and killed new critters.  The Steamfont Mountains<br/>
are particularly cool.  The windmills are particularly impressive (ooc -<br/>
makes me want to go back and visit Holland again).<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn&#39;t for that - I&#39;d probably still be operating out of E Commons and<br/>
N. Ro - and not &quot;see the world&quot;.   OOC - I think it&#39;s a smart design feature<br/>
by the makers - as it forces you to play the bard - roaming the world,<br/>
seeing the sights meeting new people...<br/>
<br/>
The more I play this game - the more I like it - and the less I liked my UOL<br/>
experience.  I like the social interaction of online - and I really NEVER<br/>
met anyone in UOL - too worried about getting jumped and your stuff stolen.<br/>
And (at least while I was online) the buddy list thingy never worked.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people complain about the quirks of the Name filter - but I<br/>
ultimately like it.  I got bit - It rejected &quot;Slide&quot; which I&#39;ve played on<br/>
many an online (and solo) game - but big deal - in this land the spelling is<br/>
different and hence &quot;Slyde&quot;.  I&#39;ll gladly give that up to never see<br/>

&gt; I believe that the bards in the back room of the guild hall sell a<br/>
&gt; smattering of songs. I know that the 8th level song, Lament, is only<br/>
&gt; available in Kelethin as is 11 and 13 I think. A few higher level songs<br/>
seem<br/>
&gt; available at all bard guilds but most of them will be hidden in other<br/>
remote<br/>
&gt; places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure, tehre are some lists around on the internet listing the locations of<br/>
&gt; most of the songs but I think it is more fun to ask fellow bards in-game<br/>
&gt; where they might be.<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached<br/>
&gt; 8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>
&gt; My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; 7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the<br/>
&gt; songs.<br/>
&gt; Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild<br/>
&gt; leader<br/>
&gt; in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me<br/>
&gt; directly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>
&gt; 8th level Bardess<br/>
