<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551902413">Uhm, this is actually affects more that just duels.   But then I guess they<br/>
must view &quot;dueling down&quot; for naked run ins or making storage corpses or<br/>
whatever as something they dont want happening.  O rthey just dont know how<br/>
people play the game.  And again, they are either fixing stuff that&#39;s not<br/>
really broken when there is so much broken stuff un-fixed or they are<br/>
addressing some PvP server issue by slamming their &quot;fix&quot; on everyone. If a<br/>
significant number of people played PvP, it would be more justifiable but<br/>
with so few in PvP - why do they wreck things for everyone else?  And this<br/>
pretty much truly wrecks &quot;fun&quot; dueling in the main arena zone.  Not just for<br/>
bards but for all mana classes.  WTF - through on full res affects too.  Sap<br/>
all your str/agi/dex too - you deserve it for dieing!<br/>
<br/>
Every week, their &quot;vision&quot; of how Norrath &quot;should be&quot; and the way that the<br/>
vast majority of their paying customers have enjoyed playing it for the past<br/>
nearly 12 monthes - grows further and further apart. They are losing people<br/>
in dribs and drabs now - just wait until the &quot;bulk&quot; of the population has<br/>
gotten all the good loots and peaked out at 50. And alot is gonna happen in<br/>
the next 60 days - before we see any expansion packs.  A few new zones with<br/>
more lizards somehow does not seem like its gonna be a solid answer to some<br/>
very real problems.<br/>

&gt; Was apparently mostly server side, and didn&#39;t affect anything<br/>
&gt; player-related except for PvP (and duel)-related deaths.  Now players<br/>
&gt; respawn with 0 mana if they were killed by another player. </span></blockquote></div>
