<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119893226">bah, half elves have nicer plate, i hate my wood elf plate, its not shiny<br/>
much and i have a Cadillac hood ornament on my head with my crested helm,<br/>
feel so stupid. Ppl constantly telling me a bird hit me in the forehead or<br/>
some stupidity like that. Half elf or human is the way to go for plate<br/>
look... as far as banded is concerned, if you want a blackened crown, i got<br/>
one from the doing the ogre head quest in kaladim first shot, i had bought<br/>
one head for 7pp and a friend got me the second one, it pays to help out<br/>
lower level friends sometimes as they hunt these zones and see whats being<br/>
given away/sold in them hehe (Cornflunk and Zarchoomi). you go to the<br/>
warrior guild, the dwarf that gives the goblin beads quest, i forgot his<br/>
name but give him the 2 heads, he&#39;ll give ya blackened armor, i got a crown,<br/>
maybe its effected as to what level you are, i was in the 20&#39;s when i did<br/>
this quest.  Cant wait to get a guise of the deceiver to morph into a dark<br/>
elf.  Then again, the dark elf helm is nice but has a nasty overbite 8)<br/>
