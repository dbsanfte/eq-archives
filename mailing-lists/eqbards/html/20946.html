<b>Subject:</b> a few kaesora questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255508945">anyone know where the strathbone shell shield in kaesora drops, i have a<br/>
couple friends that would love to get their hands on it, im assuming the<br/>
spiders but dunno.<br/>
<br/>
Was in there last night trying to get the stupid fang, took us 2 hours to<br/>
get to the rest of the gang down there waiting for him to spawn (they were<br/>
down there 6 hours and got 3 fangs only) and we were there a couple hours<br/>
and only 1 spawned.  <br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, got some truesilver boots (AC11)from a ravener for my<br/>
bard (he&#39;s only got steel booties on) and we all got a ransackers pack (25%<br/>
weight reduction) from spectral guardians.  We got lost big time in there,<br/>
its a very cool layout for a dungeon and was fun running around lost in it,<br/>
seems very big, we killed a librarian and got a tome (6int 6 wis) and<br/>
basically ran around killing everything in sight. <br/>
<br/>
But anyways, thats not the main reason i writing this email, my main<br/>
question is where do i go to get the coin (and whats it from) from the<br/>
xolvarg or wahtever he&#39;s called  and also, what the hell is a Spectral<br/>
Pestle for from the spectral guardians.... they&#39;re no drop and alakazams has<br/>
no info on it.<br/>
<br/>
One last question, anything else i should pick up while im there?<br/>
<br/>
-Minkin 37 bard<br/>
-Rakka 52 necro  &lt;-- he&#39;s camping the place as its easier for him then the<br/>
bard<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I love that cattana song, the bard i was with yesterday kept me and the<br/>
wizard full mana and i was nuking like a maniac, especially that it stacks<br/>
with lich form</div>
