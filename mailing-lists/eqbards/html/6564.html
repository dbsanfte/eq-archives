<div id="ygrps-yiv-604060365">Not sure, but Guard McClosky is definitely among the corrupt guards and when<br/>
I was there was one faction step away from KOS for me.  Unfortunately he was<br/>
also red so I steered clear.  Perhaps some higher level bards can relate<br/>
more info.  I&#39;m sure there is a lot more to the corrupt guards storyline<br/>
than anyone has figured out, or at least related, but I&#39;m not sure where to<br/>
go with it at this point.<br/>
