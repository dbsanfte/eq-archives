<div id="ygrps-yiv-773769061">A lot of people think that SS should trade straight up for the corresponding armor piece for their class.<br/>
They ignore the fact that SS comes into the world at about the same rate as their armor does, and that<br/>
there are a lot fewer high-level Bards.  On the other hand, there are a LOT of Bard twinks with money to<br/>
throw around, which screws things up.  My friend sold SS arms just this last weekend for 5kpp.  Luckily<br/>
for me, I&#39;m in a guild which just hands stuff around if another guild member needs it, so I have 4 pieces<br/>
without ever having seen one drop.  I think if you&#39;re patient, you&#39;ll find someone who&#39;s having trouble<br/>
dumping the stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using a Lizardscale Cloak myself.  I was wondering the same thing.<br/>

&gt; and stuff that think cobalt is an even trade for (haha right!)  So i keep to<br/>
&gt; myself quiet... Got free ss boots a while back from a friend. Got a free SS<br/>
&gt; helm other night from some friends who just came out of seb. And 2 nights<br/>
&gt; ago i get a few people asking me about bards in guildchat, one was asking me<br/>
&gt; what i was using because he wanted to &quot;twink&quot; his level 30 bard (ok at least<br/>
&gt; its not a lev 4). And then a good buddie sends me a tell right afterwards<br/>
&gt; asking me if i had my ss gloves, i told him thats why im hunting in karnors<br/>
&gt; at 41. Soooo next time i see his chanter i get a free set of ss gloves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another question: what are people using as a cloak? (other then cloak of<br/>
&gt; flames)<br/>
&gt; I got a kunzar cloak last night (hey i was using bronze) and was wondering<br/>
&gt; if i should ask my buddy to trade me his lizzie cloak, or should i try to<br/>
&gt; buy a better cloak, if so which?<br/>
