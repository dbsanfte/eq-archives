<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662918606">You may be correct... this is only based on what I&#39;ve read on the Concert<br/>
Hall.  At least one, or two, of the Bards over there had the same thing<br/>
happen (no stone), then they did the  quest again with the #1 slot open and<br/>
did receive the stone, -and- they stated that they had seen the same bug<br/>
before with other NPC&#39;s (hence the reason for trying it).<br/>
<br/>
And besides, it doesn&#39;t hurt anything to give it a shot.  But like I said,<br/>
this is second hand information and I&#39;ve yet to experience anything like it<br/>
personally.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve heard  that this is a carry over from one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;old &quot;merchant&quot; bugs that used to be in the game.  You <br/>
&gt; &gt;have to have your upper-most left inventory slot free.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Several bards on the concert hall have reported this -<br/>
&gt; &gt;with that slot open you (should) get your stone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve never seen this problem.  I think these<br/>
&gt; solutions are more speculation than anything.  Verant in the<br/>
&gt; most recent patch stated that sometimes quests would not give<br/>
&gt; any reward and they have fixed this (supposedly).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would chalk it up to coding bugs, and not pick-your-favorite-slot<br/>
&gt; open in your inventory.  Again, I&#39;ve had every type of Lambent Gem<br/>
&gt; fall into a backpack slot after it was made 100% of the time.<br/>
