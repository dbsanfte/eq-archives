&gt;Well, for mages (yes I have an enchanter too - funny how they seem to fill<br/>
&gt;the same slot in magic circles as we bards do) although I may have trouble<br/>
&gt;deciding - it is INFINITELY easier to memorize spells, than songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since we never get meditiate - our songs mem as slowly as the day we get<br/>
&gt;them - THAT is a problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Besides the ONE song we have that DOES use manna, any reason they can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;make our songs faster as we progress in skill?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, not true.  Go rememorize Chant of Battle.  Now, start a new Bard,<br/>
earn the money for the Chant, and memorize it.  Muuuuch slower when you<br/>
first get it.<br/>
<br/>
We do speed up.  Maybe not like the difference with Meditate, but it&#39;s<br/>
there all the same.<br/>
