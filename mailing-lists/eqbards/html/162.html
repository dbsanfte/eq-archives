&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did some test to find out the efficiency of Jonathans Warsong and<br/>
&gt; Anthem de Arms.<br/>

As to some of your questions, as to which is best, chords vs. hymn, it&#39;s<br/>
hard to say, since it depends largely on the situation.  If your group<br/>
has been sharing the damage, and everyone is fairly hurt, and you&#39;re<br/>
planning on starting a fight again soon as the current fight is over,<br/>
Hymn is definately best.   If you&#39;re fighting multiple opponents, and<br/>
you&#39;re in no danger of angering bigger badder opponents, Chords is<br/>
definately best.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed is that you say you stack Anthem, Warsong and Chords<br/>
etc.  This tactic doesn&#39;t actually work all that well.   This has to do<br/>
with my pulse vs. constant theory.  Bard songs fit into two categories,<br/>
in my opinion, pulse songs and constant songs.  Constant songs have an<br/>
effect that lasts as long as the icon is on your screen.  Anthem is a<br/>
good example.  Once it is activated, the increase in strength and attack<br/>
speed lasts until that icon disappears, even if you stop playing the<br/>
song.  Other songs, like Chords of Dissonance or Hymn of Restoration are<br/>
pulse-based, only giving you an effect when the lights flash.  The pulse<br/>
based songs, therefore, do not stack well, since sharing their playing<br/>
time with others only leads to their effectiveness being decreased.<br/>
