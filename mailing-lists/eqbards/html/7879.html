I have to put in a word about twinking here, as we outfitted a L2 warrior <br/>
last night in west Freeport with a backpack, lighstone (he was human), Fine <br/>
Steel LongSword, full set of patchwork and 50pp. Why? People make this game, <br/>
not items or levels or money. It is becoming our ne guild hobby for those <br/>
who can afford it. When we go into newbie areas, we give away stuff to those <br/>
who are low level. Maybe they ask a question or just role play well or just <br/>
look needy, but we have started giving stuff away rather than sell it. <br/>
Actually it is quite fun to do, good opportunity for role play, and maybe we <br/>
are giving the casual player a leg up. This particular person was from the <br/>
test server and was just getting started on a regular server. We keep looted <br/>
items that someone can use and if no one in the guild needs them, we have <br/>
started donating them to those who can use them.<br/>
I have also noticed that being higher level and hanging out in newbie areas <br/>
for awhile can let low level, first time characters see what your class can <br/>
become. They will ask lots of questions that they may not have otherwise <br/>
gotten an opportunity to otherwise. Granted here is the occasional d00d or <br/>
beggar, especially near the bank.<br/>
We only camp stuff for those who will use the item and they have to come <br/>
along on the camp. John is right, nothing I hate more than casters solo <br/>
camping the Shinlord for GB&#39;s when I have a L36 paladin friend who needs one <br/>
and has camped repeatedly with no spawns.<br/>
On a different note, I finally got my Guise this weekend and so far it has <br/>
not stuck a song.<br/>
