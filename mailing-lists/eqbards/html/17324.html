<br/>
I am still all PII based on my 5 gaming computers.  Hehe, I&#39;m not planning<br/>
on upgrading any of them to PIII until I can find a game that can come close<br/>
to stressing the GeForce + PII 450 combination.  At that point, it will be<br/>
time to go for the latest PIII or PIV and grab the ultimate video card<br/>
available at that time.  That way, I&#39;ll at least buy myself a year or two<br/>
without really needing to upgrade all 5 computers again :).  For now,<br/>
however, the games on the market are primarily video card bound and not CPU<br/>
bound.  I was disappointed with the Voodoo3 and TNT2 cards, but I&#39;m<br/>
overjoyed at the results that I&#39;ve seen with the GeForce.<br/>
<br/>
If you are running a PII computer and think you need to upgrade to a PIII to<br/>
play some of these new games, I&#39;d highly recommend dropping the $300 or so<br/>
(got my GeForce for $275) on a new video card instead and buy yourself<br/>
another 6 to 9 months before your framerates start to go south.<br/>
<br/>
If you are running a PIII then the cheaper TNT2 sounds like your best<br/>
alternative until the new Voodoo4/5 series or NV15 come out.  Even then,<br/>
what would be the ultimate goal?  Full particle density on a dragon raid?<br/>
Hehehe, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find the dragon in all the flashing lights!<br/>
You&#39;d be blind for weeks :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; See Tom&#39;s Hardware page for a full run-down on the differences and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is still a noticeable improvement of the GeForce over a TNT 2 Ultra<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have an older system an upgrade to the GeForce may be a good idea.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re on a newer PIII system I would wait till the NV15 or Bitboys new<br/>
&gt; Graphics cards come out.  Both cards are at least 4 times better than the<br/>
&gt; GeForce and should market at about $400.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>
&gt; based on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133 chipset<br/>
&gt; with 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; use SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>
&gt; system on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
