		How is this evidence of &quot;bard hate&quot; at all?  Gordon said two<br/>
things:<br/>
		1.  Druids won&#39;t be able to track better than Bards.<br/>
		2.  Bard&#39;s tracking cap is too high, but won&#39;t be changed<br/>
(i.e. No Nerf).<br/>
<br/>
Not in today&#39;s patch but this is something new - now we know that they have<br/>
an agenda and feel that parts of bard&#39;s are &quot;over powerful&quot; (yes, that<br/>
tracking that you get at level 35 certainly is nice but un-balanced? Better<br/>
than rangers - perhaps but IMHO rangers track was poorly designed from the<br/>
get go - ie being zone wide at higher levels so you can see all of the tree<br/>
snakes that have spawned on the other side of the zone.  Make Ranger better<br/>
(color code for level cons, selectable range, etc. make ranger better at<br/>
tracking - don&#39;t make bards worse.)  What else is on that agenda?  Selos too<br/>
fast? <br/>
<br/>
Sylly (wants to know)<br/>
(or maybe she doesn&#39;t want to know - she certainly does not want to find out<br/>
cus it will prolly be the &quot;hard way.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		If you think this is an example of &quot;bard hate&quot; then I&#39;d<br/>
think you are too<br/>
		paranoid and just looking for any chance to slam Verant.<br/>
