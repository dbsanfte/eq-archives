timing is not right to interrupt spells, stutter it (possibly<br/>
letting one spell get through).  You will almost always<br/>
interrupt all subsequent spells (barring resists).  Against<br/>
single casters, this is the strategy I use.  I&#39;ve tried<br/>
buffing resists or letting others bash/stun, but always end up<br/>
coming back to this strategy.  Most of the folks I group with<br/>
are smart enough to announce major spells like long stuns or<br/>
torgors, so I know when to let up.<br/>
<br/>
Against multiple casters, it&#39;s different.  When Lullaby used<br/>
to work, I&#39;d use that just as effectively to interrupt all the<br/>
casters.  Nowadays, I either just buff resists (if no<br/>
enchanter), or use Pixie Strike (if enchanter is mezing) when<br/>
I feel it&#39;s needed (when I think a stun is about to wear off).<br/>
<br/>
Btw, an enchanter&#39;s tashani, Pixie Strike&#39;s magic resist<br/>
debuff, and a charisma buff (to about 185) do wonders.  My<br/>
guild had Estrella (L51 mermaid) trained onto us in Kedge.  I<br/>
kept our magic resist up throughout the fight (most of my<br/>
L35-45 party reported resisting her ink blindness about half<br/>
the time).  By the time we got her down to about 15%, I<br/>
started Striking continuously to interrupt her spells (didn&#39;t<br/>
know if she was a healer).  Strike stuck about 2/3rds of the<br/>
time, and interrupted at least 5 spells by my count.<br/>
