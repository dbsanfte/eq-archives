<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182079583">A friend of mine had a good idea about armor wearing restrictions.  He proposed<br/>
that a character&#39;s ability to wear types of armor be based on their defense<br/>
skill.  This way you could put a defense rating requirement on each type of<br/>
armor.  The rationale being that it takes a certain amount of martial training<br/>
in order to fight effectively in various types of armor.  Just to throw some<br/>
numbers out as examples, lets say:<br/>
<br/>
Defense Skill  0 is sufficient for cloth, 20 for patchwork and leather, 50 for<br/>
Banded and Chain, 100 for Plate.  (Magical Equivalents like netted, woven,<br/>
rubicite would require further consideration, and this is BY NO MEANS anything<br/>
more than an illustration, no change is being suggested here).<br/>
<br/>
Yet another way to approach this is to make each armor type a skill which would<br/>
modify how well a certain armor worked for a character.<br/>
<br/>
I think both are good ideas, but the current system is good enough.</div>
