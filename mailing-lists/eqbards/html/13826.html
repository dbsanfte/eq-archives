<b>Subject:</b> Play Time? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-840076840">Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
characters, each on a different server:<br/>
<br/>
Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>
Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
<br/>
I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>
than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>
well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>
