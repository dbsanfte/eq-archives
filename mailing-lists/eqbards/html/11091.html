<b>Subject:</b> Power of charm <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553880">Ok, I had read here about the 30th bard saying he charmed HG&#39;s and I had<br/>
charmed Cyclopses in the past. Today I was running through NK (when I<br/>
was 32nd level)when I saw 2 HG&#39;s, I had already typed &quot;/shout 2 HG&#39;s<br/>
near Stone...&quot; when I stopped. and I thought:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m near the zone, I&#39;m faster than these guys, what can it hurt?&quot;<br/>
so I switched to charm hotkey bank and fired it up. it failed and the HG<br/>
actually caught me and whacked me down to 1/2 health (forgot how fast<br/>
they really are). then while fleeing, I hit charm again, and it stuck. I<br/>
sic&#39;d the Hg on the other one and was able to complete the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately my HG lost and I was too scared to switch targets. as I<br/>
was running to the zone though, I passed a griffon. and i thought &quot;hey!&quot;<br/>
So I charmed it and sent it after the injured HG. It killed the HG<br/>
quickly and I looted it &quot;WOW&quot; 3 plat and 54 gold! and then as I was<br/>
running to the zone I passed a griffenne, so I sent my griffon to kill<br/>
it! and then i zoned :)<br/>
<br/>
I never saw 2 HG&#39;s again, but later I saw a red griffon and a yellow HG.<br/>
I charmed the griffon and sent it against the HG. This time I did switch<br/>
targets and it was obvious my griffon was losing badly. so I switched<br/>
and charmed the HG, who won with 50% of his health left. <br/>
<br/>
Just a bit later (after a stint in HHK where I made 33rd level) I was<br/>
passing thru the oasis and I saw a yellow and red Sand Giant standing<br/>
next to each other. again I thought &quot;hey!&quot; so I charmed the red SG. it<br/>
failed about 3 times, but then it took and I had about 75% success rate<br/>
from then on out. I actually Killed a Sand Giant! and for loot I got<br/>
44plat and a FS sword!<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed! we actually ARE that powerful!<br/>
