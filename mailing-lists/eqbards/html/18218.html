<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158718393">Hehe, I had gone back to look at the stats last night so I have them with me.  You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>
first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of new items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>
Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just about EVERY class and race except<br/>
pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which goes great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>
her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>
this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>
<br/>
The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>
and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro only I believe.  The key though is<br/>
they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>
were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We saw a number of new items drop last night also including an AC16 -2Cha<br/>
&gt; &gt; +5 just about everything else<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadow knight/necro tunic and a AC6 Necro bracer (both purple).  We also<br/>
&gt; &gt; saw Mace of Ykesha drop about 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; times, dam 10, del 22, effect Ykesha.  A friend paladin got an Awesome Axe<br/>
&gt; &gt; dam 32, del 40, +6 str +6 agi<br/>
&gt; &gt; and my wife looted a rather humerous Axe, Dam 45, del 150 Barb/Troll/Ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; only off of a Mountain Giant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The one that I&#39;m REALLY trying to get right now is a good friend (another<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard) got a pair of AC18 bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; only boots plus some stats that are the same color as the hero bracer out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Kunar Castle :-)<br/>
