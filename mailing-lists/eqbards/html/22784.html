<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362093355">Reaver Hill in E Karana.  I hunted there quite a bit around 20th.  If you<br/>
see a gnoll named Splintered Claw though, run for the zone immediately.<br/>
He&#39;s a necro around 24th level and we all know how balanced necro&#39;s are.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Looking for place to hunt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have hit level 20 and I need to get some good feedback.  I want to <br/>
do some research on what people feel as a good place to hunt.  I will <br/>
have a LOT of time on my hands in the coming winter months.  The time <br/>
of day I tend to hunt threre aren&#39;t too many people online so <br/>
grouping usually isn&#39;t an option.  Any ideas on where I can solo?<br/>
<br/>
PS I am posting this to several groups so my apologies if you see <br/>
this more than once.<br/>
