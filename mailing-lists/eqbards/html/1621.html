&gt;Does anyone know if there is any official material chronicling the history<br/>
&gt;of Norrath other than the small piece that is in the manual?  As a bard, I<br/>
&gt;figure it falls onto us to educate others of Norrath&#39;s history through our<br/>
&gt;songs.  Baldur&#39;s Gate did a good job of providing this info by placing<br/>
&gt;numerous books throughout the game that told the history of the Forgotten<br/>
&gt;Realms.  I&#39;m looking to find some material so I can write some stuff for<br/>
&gt;future performances at organized events.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
