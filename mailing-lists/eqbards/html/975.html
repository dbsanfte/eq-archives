<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367440635">Its really very simple to keep 2 songs stacked, and not too hard to<br/>
get 3 going.  Just watch for the line in your text box that tells you<br/>
the song effect just happened to scroll by.  In full screen mode that<br/>
line of text is in blue, and fairly easy to spot amidts all the other<br/>
clutter scrolling by.  Don&#39;t try and time it using the icons up in<br/>
the top right of the screen.  Start with just juggling two songs to<br/>
get used to it, then try for 3 if you want.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	OK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing<br/>
&gt; two songs<br/>
&gt; at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some<br/>
&gt; sort of<br/>
&gt; special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves<br/>
&gt; starting<br/>
&gt; one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of<br/>
&gt; button<br/>
&gt; pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have<br/>
&gt; failed<br/>
&gt; entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I<br/>
&gt; hardly ever<br/>
&gt; actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt; when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any<br/>
&gt; effect of<br/>
&gt; either song!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over<br/>
&gt; zealous but<br/>
&gt; very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a<br/>
&gt; lot of you<br/>
&gt; take seriously. <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	I for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . . <br/>
