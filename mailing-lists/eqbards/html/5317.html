Yup, that&#39;s why all the SoW timings I have were done via SoW<br/>
cast on my character.  Same computer, same connection, and<br/>
often times same location and time of day (accounting for<br/>
variable lag).  I always do a baseline check with normal<br/>
running speed every time I do another test, and normalize<br/>
against that before adding it to the chart.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I wonder if this means I have an excuse for getting<br/>
JBoots... :-)<br/>
