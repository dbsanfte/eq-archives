world.  Is this your 2nd character?   Since you need money, I wouldn&#39;t think<br/>
so.  Get out and see the world!  I&#39;d recommend Unrest (can always find a<br/>
group), maybe CazicThule or Guk (bring your own group).  Maybe try<br/>
Permafrost or even Everfrost (join a group hunting mammoths).  You can try<br/>
Rathe Mountains (Giant skellies, monk skeletons).  Most of the places you&#39;ll<br/>
need a group, but I&#39;ve always been much more of a group fighter.  If you<br/>
prefer to play solo, You should probably stay in the Karanas, fighting<br/>
Aviaks or some beetles may give xp at your level.  <br/>
