<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966812221"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmm, you may be right.  The only reason I can see for Chain to<br/>
&gt; override root is because it also has a slowdown component.  <br/>
&gt; But that doesn&#39;t make sense if you follow my thinking that<br/>
&gt; stronger effects should override weaker.  Yet if you have<br/>
&gt; enchanter celerity and bard celerity, you get the enchanter<br/>
&gt; speedup AND the bard stat boost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It is most puzzling.  The game mechanics intrigue me as much<br/>
  as the game play does.  I, like yourself, tend to want to<br/>
  quantify game components, and it&#39;s frustrating to see some<br/>
  things work one way, and other things contradict pervious<br/>
  assumptions.  It&#39;s like learning English as a language.<br/>
  It has so many intricate rules and exceptions, that it is<br/>
  difficult to grasp... even for people who already speak<br/>
  it.<br/>
<br/>
  I will attempt to run some more tests on the counteractiveness<br/>
  of our songs versus caster equivalent spell lines.<br/>
