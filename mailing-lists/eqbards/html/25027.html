<div id="ygrps-yiv-805007264">I actually had W2K installed for a brief period of time, but the drivers for<br/>
the soundblaster and GeForce was not very mature so I reverted back to W98.<br/>
Havent considered switching to Win ME at all.<br/>
On a side note I quite easily do 3 songs. Depending on lag it can take me a<br/>
few combat rounds to get the timing right, but after that I never have<br/>
problemos with 3 songs.. Thought it might interest you since Im from europe<br/>
too (denmark) with a 256kbit/sec ISDN. I use TDC as provider. Before I got<br/>
ADSL I used ISDN and tried serveral providers:<br/>
- World Online<br/>
- CyberCity<br/>
- Mira<br/>
- TDC<br/>
- Uni2<br/>
- Get2Net<br/>
For everyone but TDC and uni2 the connection was ok when I used it outside<br/>
prime hours (primehours being 19:00-&gt;23:00) but lag increased (for some<br/>
providers severly) during primehours.<br/>
With TDC and the lag dont increase much even during primetime, and with Uni2<br/>
the connection is PERFECT!!<br/>
Uni2 is however way too expensive!<br/>
Its a bit more difficualt to test providers when using ADSL *grin*, so I<br/>
havent experimented around..<br/>
Well back to topic..<br/>
I can twist 4 songs with only a few failures, but its simply too much a<br/>
hazzle to do. With 3 songs I can throw in a /g add<br/>
/g mezzin /g charmed if needs be. That is impossible with 4. I also do not<br/>
twist during downtime unless its really needed (Cleric need to get mana and<br/>
health is low for instance (cantana, healing or cantana, clarity, clarity..)<br/>

&gt;  I use a PIII 800 with 256 Meg of Ram and  GForce II with 32 <br/>
&gt; meg of video memory.  <br/>
&gt; I can do three songs with ease -- barring lag which gets <br/>
&gt; pretty heavy at times in Europe -- even with an adsl <br/>
&gt; connection.  4 songs are managable under really good <br/>
&gt; circumstances with, as some others have mentioned, a bit of <br/>
&gt; drop off at the end...<br/>
&gt; on guild raids with six groups fighting in close proximity, <br/>
&gt; twisting more than two songs is tough, but managable.<br/>
&gt; SOmebody mentioned that Win98 is a poor memorymanager and I <br/>
&gt; must agree -- Can anybody comment on Win ME doing a better <br/>
&gt; job of this?  If upgrading to ME will help me twist songs <br/>
&gt; better, I&#39;ll do it in a heartbeat.<br/>

&gt; recently upgraded because of the same problem, frame rate.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know what was going to give me what I wanted.  So I played <br/>
&gt; hit and miss.<br/>
&gt; Months back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100. <br/>
&gt;  I didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; any noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron <br/>
&gt; (overclocked to<br/>
&gt; 450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>
&gt; There was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my <br/>
&gt; clipping plane<br/>
&gt; maxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free <br/>
&gt; run.  I fact<br/>
&gt; I did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>
&gt; However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  <br/>
&gt; If I turn the<br/>
&gt; clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a <br/>
&gt; decent trade off<br/>
&gt; in viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the <br/>
&gt; TNT card is<br/>
&gt; holding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming <br/>
&gt; out later in<br/>
&gt; the year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To <br/>
&gt; what I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>
