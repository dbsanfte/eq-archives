<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227735117">Hello all- believe it or not, at level 28 I have yet to travel to quite a<br/>
few dungeons. Since I am currently in Kaladim, I thought I would give Unrest<br/>
a try.<br/>
My questions are this: what songs should i be using primarily-both as a<br/>
battle bard and as a buff party bard?<br/>
My current machime though is only a p233 and weaving more than 2 songs,<br/>
maybe 3 on a good connection day, is about my max-2 being the norm for me.<br/>
Any suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
