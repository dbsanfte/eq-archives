<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003545798"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Verant _knows_ that they are in the entertainment business.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  They aren&#39;t very entertaining as of late.  Still I hope, I come<br/>
  back everyday thinking it will be a better world.  Tomorrow, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes they will make mistakes.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The word sometimes here isn&#39;t strong enough, Most of the time works.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But any time there is a change in the status quo - you will hear complaints.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Or when they decide to just completely break your songs/skills,<br/>
  you&#39;ll hear complaints then too.<br/>

  Btw, add this to the bugs list.  Safe Fall doesn&#39;t work in the zone<br/>
  to which you logged into.  I took 120 dmg jumping off a cliff in<br/>
  Everfrost when I usually take about 30.  Harmonic chalks up another.<br/>
  Stamina drain, safe fall broken, I bet other skills fail to apply<br/>
  themselves in the zone you appear at.  I don&#39;t even bother to feed-<br/>
  back anymore, not worth my time since they are adding echo-ing to<br/>
  caves and dungeons and I don&#39;t wanna disturb them. =)<br/>
