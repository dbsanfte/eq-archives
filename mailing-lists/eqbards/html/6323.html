<div id="ygrps-yiv-801579216">OK,<br/>
Here is my dilemma.  I created my bard as pretty much<br/>
a rogueish lad.  I tend to be drunk a LOT (yes, much<br/>
to the dismay of my friends, even in battle) and tease<br/>
EVERYBODY (my clan is SOOO sick of Limericks).  In<br/>
keeping with this, I have stuck to peircing weapons<br/>
since level 2 (where I found a nifty rusty spear).  I<br/>
am fairly well armed now, with a Dragoon Dirk and a<br/>
Combine Rapier (what I wouldn&#39;t give for an Ashenwood<br/>
Spear) and so far I LOVE my choice of weapons (Since I<br/>
NEVER seem to get into a group with more than one<br/>
tank...and usually that is me..I have fit into the<br/>
role of battle bard more than I&#39;d care to think<br/>
about).<br/>
<br/>
My big question.  Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>
me at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>
weapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>
bards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>
roleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>
levels?  I really like the bard I created, as he is<br/>
SOOO different from the Cleric I had, and Im managing<br/>
to turn my guild into a bunch of drunks with me..hehe,<br/>
but I don&#39;t want to find out at level 3x that I should<br/>
have chosen to raise my 1h slash, as to do any decent<br/>
damage and be worth my wieght, I need to wield a<br/>
1hSlash weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Work with me here folks, Im at work and sober (in game<br/>
and IRL)<br/>
