 </span></blockquote>Psalm of Warmth is a very very very useful song if you&#39;re<br/>
soloing.  When soloing, nearly anything that gives you<br/>
experience is going to hit you lots and lots of times.  With<br/>
the Psalm of Warmth&#39;s fire shield, your opponent takes damage<br/>
every time he hits you.  At L27 it was &quot;only&quot; 4 points per<br/>
hit, but considering you&#39;re probably going to be hit 20-40<br/>
times in a solo fight, that&#39;s 80-160 points of free damage.<br/>
<br/>
I was having trouble soloing defenders in Cazic until I<br/>
thought of this.  I started weaving the Psalm and suddenly the<br/>
fights I&#39;d been losing handily before, I started winning.<br/>
Weave it with Hymn and you can make the battle last even<br/>
longer causing your opponent to take even more damage.  If you<br/>
can manage four songs, I&#39;d do Anthem, Psalm, Chain, Hymn.  If<br/>
you can only do three, I&#39;d drop Chain - you will be taking<br/>
more hits, but your opponent will be taking damage for each of<br/>
those hits, so it&#39;s not as great a loss as you&#39;d first think.<br/>
Swap Chain for Psalm when your opponent starts to flee.<br/>
