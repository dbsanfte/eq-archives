<div id="ygrps-yiv-526300040">YA! More geriatrics!  I am 36 myself (37 next month), and I usually have to<br/>
break out the icepacks if I have been doing a marathon session on the<br/>
weekends.  Let the youngins swap instruments/weapons every beat, I&#39;d rather<br/>
be having a beer and flirting with the cute wood elf (once I have made sure<br/>
she is really a she, lol) :)<br/>

&gt; 	I&#39;ve been playing EQ since release - and have just <br/>
&gt; dinged to 51.  I have<br/>
&gt; never switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn <br/>
&gt; that it&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; for the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with <br/>
&gt; age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>
&gt; and lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Also - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that <br/>
&gt; other people level a<br/>
&gt; lot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	It&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed <br/>
&gt; out for many of<br/>
&gt; us - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>
&gt; accumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view <br/>
&gt; this as a flame -<br/>
&gt; if that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>
&gt; personal taste!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in <br/>
&gt; down-time.  In certain<br/>
&gt; situations I will - but its very much the exception not the <br/>
&gt; rule.  I need to<br/>
&gt; do some socializing and rest the fingers!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the <br/>
&gt; truely insane.<br/>
&gt; I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
&gt; constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ <br/>
&gt; is after all a<br/>
&gt; social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting <br/>
&gt; constantly.  If<br/>
&gt; I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only <br/>
&gt; leaving one song<br/>
&gt; playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or <br/>
&gt; guildsay.  So<br/>
&gt; tell that monk to relax =)<br/>
