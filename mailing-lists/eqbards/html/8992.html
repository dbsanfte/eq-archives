<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805980568">I agree I tend to believe bard hate is a myth. Grouping and causing<br/>
agrovation of course but that goes with any class. If your healing 13 or so<br/>
points per tic for 6 people and you are on the opposite team as me I would<br/>
be pissed to :). That pretty much goes the same for buffs.. Your playing<br/>
Anthem or something adding so much str and attack speed to  every person<br/>
thats beating on me.. same thing I would go after you first.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note I saw some  verry nasty  incident of mob agrovation.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Cazic the other night  with my mid to upper 20s group and we are<br/>
pulling this lizard and that lizard. All the way across the courtyard  was<br/>
an old level 50 cleric friend of mine. We are NOT grouped with him not<br/>
having ANYTHING to do what the 50th cleric was doing. AND we are pulling<br/>
our pulls to the opposite side of the courtyard. These mobs are INSANELY<br/>
green to a 50th cleric considering most are blue to me at 26th. Anyways,<br/>
during the course of our battle  I would see the 50th cleric heal one of his<br/>
group way across the yard, having nothing to do with our group. Our mob<br/>
would make a B line for the cleric and we would be off chasing our pull.<br/>
This happened several times. I asked the cleric if perchance he was casting<br/>
on our mob or healing us or anything. Nope..  the mob just hated a 50th<br/>
cleric helping anyone I guess.<br/>
<br/>
As far as bard agrovation, its not to bad for me even when I am the pulling.<br/>
If I start taking damage ill have a caster root and let some one tank. I<br/>
wield a staff of writhing and a silvery 1h. (sometimes pgt or my duel<br/>
daggers for skill)<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have been hearing rumors that &quot;bard hate&quot; does not really<br/>
&gt;&gt; exist... Anyone actually have proof that it does?<br/>
