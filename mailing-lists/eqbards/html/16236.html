<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970262342">Probably could have if we hadn&#39;t gotten so damn spoiled having the Necro<br/>
there....  Like I said, our biggest problem was the spawns were spaced to<br/>
close together to hold the room without the necro there.  Against the lord,<br/>
the necro definately did a lot more damage then the wizard was able to...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; spawn.  IIRC the smallest/weakest group i&#39;ve done lord<br/>
&gt; with was: 50 war, 49 cleric, 48 druid, 50 rogue, 42<br/>
&gt; shaman?  Something like that...so I would have thought<br/>
&gt; you could hold it just fine with either wiz or necro.<br/>
