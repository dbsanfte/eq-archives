&gt;Nope. When I go through Highpass, I don&#39;t sit around. If<br/>
&gt;you remember (if you&#39;ve been) the area out front of the<br/>
&gt;keep, there&#39;s two halls that you can take to get into the<br/>
&gt;Keep zone. There&#39;s guards everywhere and you can see when<br/>
&gt;things are coming fairly well. There&#39;s nothing there that<br/>
&gt;could have killed me instantly with one hit without me<br/>
&gt;knowing it was coming. *shrug* Just a glitch I guess, as<br/>
&gt;long as I didn&#39;t lose anything I&#39;m not complaining.. just<br/>
&gt;thought it was rather odd.<br/>

Speaking of which, who all enjoys playing their Bard primarily because of<br/>
the ability to travel rapidly?  I mean, I know Wizards and Druids have<br/>
their nifty traveling spells, and of course, Gate has it&#39;s uses, but let&#39;s<br/>
face it - isn&#39;t there joy in watching the ground sail beneath your feet,<br/>
knowing that you aren&#39;t limited by a set of coordinates to where you can<br/>
go?  The freedom to explore that REALLY dangerous place, knowing you can<br/>
outrun *almost* anything?  Let&#39;s hear some traveler&#39;s tales...<br/>
