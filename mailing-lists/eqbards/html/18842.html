<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186498215"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1)  It&#39;s a lot more than &quot;A couple pulses&quot;.  Typically it&#39;s about 2 entire<br/>
&gt; twists (30 seconds or so) before I get mobbed.<br/>
&gt; 2)  We have far more AC than an enchanter<br/>
&gt; 3)  We have far more HP than an enchanter<br/>
&gt; 4)  We have far more melee ability than an enchanter<br/>
&gt; 5)  We have higher dodge skill than an enchanter<br/>
&gt; 6)  We can cast while being hit (an enchanter cannot)<br/>
&gt; 7)  We can outrun anything that comes near us (outdoor) they cannot.<br/>
&gt; (technically we can indoors too if you use jig and jump the whole way)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1)  I usually get jumped before we even have time to realize there are more,<br/>
and react; sometimes I get as many as 3 pulses.<br/>
2-5)  Exactly my point.  The poster stated that we had different ways to<br/>
handle the mobs, outside of AC, and then used an Enchanter as an example.  I<br/>
was pointing out that the Enchanter has the tools necessary that mitigate<br/>
the need for AC under these particular circumstances.  We have been able to<br/>
wear steel class armor for this reason since at least release; the game<br/>
mechanics have not changed in regards to the bard getting jumped in a<br/>
multi-mob scenario.<br/>
6) Rune.<br/>
7) At my level, the only time the enchanter can&#39;t outrun the outdoors mob is<br/>
if there is no druid, ranger, or shaman in the group, or the mob can keep<br/>
pace with SoW.  If they want it, it&#39;s rather easy for an enchanter at my<br/>
level to have JBoots, as well.<br/>
