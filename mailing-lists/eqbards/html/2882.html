<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232700686">What I did to find out where the agents from the Freeport side were was ask<br/>
their leader.<br/>
<br/>
example: &quot;Who is Sivina Lutewhisper?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The response, at least in Freeport, was the location of that agent.  I<br/>
asked for all 4 and was given the places.  I&#39;ve only visited 2 of the four<br/>
so far.  I love this quest!  And I agree that it has potential.<br/>
