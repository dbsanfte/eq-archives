<b>Subject:</b> New Bard Song Database on EQLizer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153078273">EQLizer&#39;s new Bard Song Database has some interesting quirks.<br/>
<br/>
They show Mez&#39;s and Calms as if they did the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
They show Bombastic Bellow as a target Stun and Regen as if that was the<br/>
intended effect and not just another example of Verant&#39;s &quot;extensive&quot; testing<br/>
failing to find the most basic bug.<br/>
<br/>
See what others can be found!<br/>
