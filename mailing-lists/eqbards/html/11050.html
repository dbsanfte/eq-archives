<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348012448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Rumor has it that this patch was intended to fix a problem with the Pegasus<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Cloak (off Quillmane in SK - I think the item name is something like that).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It seems that by hitting the proc (unlimited charges) over and over you <br/>
&gt;could rise very fast into the air.  Verant, in their infinite wisdom, fixed<br/>
<br/>
&gt;this problem by making it impossible to refresh any levitate effect.  Had <br/>
&gt;any bard-players been on the develpoment team you would think (I certainly <br/>
&gt;would, in any case) that the obvious effect on bards would be, well, <br/>
&gt;obvious.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually being an active member of an application development team in real<br/>
life, I would have though even the non-bard players among the team would<br/>
have had as their very first question, &quot;Ok good solution, what other<br/>
potential problems could this cause?&quot;  Obviously no one at Verant even<br/>
bothers to ask.  That should be every developers first question after<br/>
deciding to modify some code in an integrated system.  I can think of no one<br/>
still employed at any company I have worked for from any development team<br/>
who would modify a function that is called without first considering the<br/>
ramifications those modifications might have on other function calls.<br/>
However, I have never worked for Verant.<br/>
