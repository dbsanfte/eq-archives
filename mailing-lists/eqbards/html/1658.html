<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071832009">I haven&#39;t had good luck soloing ever and don&#39;t really care for it<br/>
personally.  Also I refuse to kite because I just don&#39;t want to spend my<br/>
time doing this, it seems absurd and overly tedious.<br/>
<br/>
At 14th level I went to east commons and hunted Darkweed snakes because I<br/>
could average about 4 to 5 gp per snake.  I found this nerve wracking, 1) to<br/>
be alone near the 3rd in always looking over my shoulder for griffins, 2)<br/>
the snakes cast poison and invariably a snake that cons blue to me would<br/>
sometimes nock me down to even 3 bubbles! Then when a passing Lion who con&#39;s<br/>
green but is high enough to challenge me decides to attack while I am<br/>
healing I have to haul my butt to the zone, losing HP the whole way from<br/>
running with poison in my system....all and all a typical example of what<br/>
happens when a bard solos in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Granted I was somewhat successful in that I was able to acquire about 10pp<br/>
in 4hours of soloing...more than I usually make, so on my way back to<br/>
Freeport I decide to pull a lesser mummy from the ruins in east commons<br/>
because it cons blue to me...the fight is going decent, I have the upper<br/>
hand, and then when the mummy gets down to 2 bubbles it suddenly kicks my<br/>
ass?  Lost all the XP I gained soloing snakes for 4 hours in that one<br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I am now 15th level and have the craziest mix of armor, a small bit of<br/>
banded, some leather, some rawhide, and even some patchwork still...what<br/>
with the cost of my songs I find it difficult to hold on to coin, and as<br/>
everyone knows even more difficult to attain it.  Any of you loaded high<br/>
level players out there that say that coin doesn&#39;t matter later in the game<br/>
I am sure you are right, but how about making a donation to my when you spot<br/>
me on the E&#39;ci server.  I have decided to take up smithing and try to be<br/>
self sufficient, however I just blew 30pp getting up to skill level 36 in it<br/>
and now am broke.  If you want to be an investor in my trade I will return<br/>
your investment with interest once things get rolling ;-)<br/>
