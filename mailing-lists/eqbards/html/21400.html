<div id="ygrps-yiv-823807494">I&#39;ve been lucky to group with a lot of the same people - and I&#39;ve pretty<br/>
much weened them off of the &quot;Manasong during combat&quot; mentality.  Personally<br/>
I think the only time it really makes sense is when you have a cleric in a<br/>
group that requires a LOT of healing...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I will include it in a 3-song twist (not the every other song mana<br/>
twist to maximize its value) if people whine for it enough - if they see the<br/>
message they are happy)..<br/>

i have to agree with you, a bard&#39;s life does change at 32, it becomes easier<br/>
to get a group because of mana song, and to like you said, most groups<br/>
couldnt care less about any other songs. you become the mana battery... When</div>
