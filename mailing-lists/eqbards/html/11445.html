I fear Kit My friend you put the cart before the horse and misunderstood my<br/>
message.  This was in part my fault for not including the orginal post, my<br/>
bad.  I was refering to the posters post on the board contradicting Brad,<br/>
hence my modifier about when we got the ability to punch magic.<br/>
<br/>
I am however curious what nerf was done to Accelerando?<br/>

&gt; You got to be kidding me?  Brad leaves out the Charm nerf for levels over<br/>
35<br/>
&gt; and the nerfing of Accelerando, which GZ himself admitted was a nerf, not<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bug fix, and you think Brad&#39;s on target?  How about the reduction to our<br/>
&gt; DoT&#39;s? another minus.  That&#39;s three big minuses in like 30 seconds, and<br/>
Brad<br/>
&gt; got other developers input on his list?  What were they working on,<br/>
&gt; sovereign?<br/>

&gt; For the most part on target in my opinion if a bit too pointed.  You are<br/>
&gt; mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>
&gt; gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>
&gt; about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>
&gt; songs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic<br/>
&gt; instrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the<br/>
&gt; instrument.<br/>
