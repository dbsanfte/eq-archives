Subject: [eqbards] Survey - System standards and Performance<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; To keep this whole concept on topic, I&#39;d like to start a survey of system<br/>
&gt; specs vs. apparent performance.<br/>
&gt; Just fill in the blanks and let&#39;s share what works and what doesn&#39;t!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Computer Specs for Bards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CPU:   pre: pII 300 / post: pIII 600<br/>
&gt; RAM: pre: 64mb / post: 128 mb (soon to be 256 or 512 when i get the cash)<br/>
&gt; Video Card (and RAM):  pre: 4mb ATI rage post: Asus GeForce 6800 Deluxe<br/>
32mb<br/>
&gt; Video Resolution: pre: 640x480 post: depends on mood, traveling, etc.<br/>
640x480 up to 1024x768<br/>
&gt; Sound Card: pre: ess1868 post: sblive x-gamer<br/>
&gt; HD speed (rpm): pre: musta been 5400 3.2 gb, post: UDMA 66 - 7200 rpm 40gb<br/>
maxtor<br/>
&gt; &#39;Net speed: pre: 24k modem post: AT&T @home cable (768 up, 128 down, i<br/>
think...although it surges much faster at time)<br/>
&gt; Geographic Location: north texas<br/>
&gt; Options enabled or disabled:<br/>
&gt;        Sky texturing: pre: single post: double or whatever max is<br/>
&gt;        Particle Effects: pre and post: enabled<br/>
&gt;        Mip Mapping: pre and post: disabled (i was gonna enable it, but<br/>
kept getting errors in drivers with new card, so i gave up)<br/>
&gt; Clip plane distance: pre and post: max (unless i was at the chicken farm<br/>
in sk, then i set it lower)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How many songs can you twist?pre: 3 maybe 4 post: well, 3 is what i twist,<br/>
i can do 4 if i want to work my fingers off...so i don&#39;t usually do it<br/>
&gt; Do you slow down when it rains? pre: YUP post: only in Overthere i think<br/>
&gt; How about in Unrest or Kunark? pre: didn&#39;t go to kunark pre, never had<br/>
much problem in unrest post: haven&#39;t been to unrest, i live in kunark, no<br/>
slowdowns, but in the Overthere, mobs seem to pop in and out alot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
biggest change i&#39;ve seen in upgrading is zone speed.  going from 64mb to<br/>
128mb took me from 2.3 minutes average to 1.2 minutes average.  going from<br/>
pii-300 to pii600 and upgrading disk speed took me down to about 12 seconds<br/>
on most zones, some a bit slower, some a bit faster.  i had 256 in for a<br/>
bit, on the new machine, and could zone into north freeport in 7 seconds,<br/>
with no lag.  with the old machine, i tried not to go to nfreep unless i HAD<br/>
to. </span></blockquote></div>
