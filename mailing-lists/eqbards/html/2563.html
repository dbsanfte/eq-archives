&gt; Well hot damn, that means when I get lung cancer from smoking all these<br/>
&gt;years that I can sue the people who made them! It&#39;s not MY fault that I<br/>
&gt;bought them in the store, not my fault I lit a bunch of crushed up plants<br/>
&gt;held together with chemically treated paper, which the paper is held round<br/>
&gt;with glue, then stuck the fiberglass type material in my mouth and sucked<br/>
&gt;on it while the opposite end was glowing red. Woohoo, using SaTaN, ahem,<br/>
&gt;excuse me, s8n&#39;s, logic, I&#39;m bound to be a millionaire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OR<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; when you grow up you&#39;ll be able to tell the difference between right and<br/>
&gt;wrong, between knowing what&#39;s the correct course of actions without someone<br/>
&gt;telling you what they are. Or maybe some other kid wanting to blame<br/>
&gt;everyone else for thier bullshit will shoot you (so they can be as cool as<br/>
&gt;the &quot;gangsta&#39;s&quot;) and your parents can sue the company that made the gun.<br/>
&gt;(since it won&#39;t be the kid who pulled the trigger&#39;s fault, no need to even<br/>
&gt;put him in jail)<br/>
