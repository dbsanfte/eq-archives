<div id="ygrps-yiv-464703061">Ok, so which shop?<br/>
I&#39;m gonna be there this weekend for the afr (alt.fairs.renaissance)<br/>
invasion.  I&#39;ll prolly be in the kilt, if you look at the pic&#39;s.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to actually meet a fellow bard :)<br/>
<br/>
And Evulia,<br/>
No, I didn&#39;t win the contest...<br/>
E.J., the shaman got 1st place, and the Troll got 2nd.  They get custom<br/>
art of their characters done for winning.  <br/>
<br/>
Talies, I was in EK as a bard at 16...if you go down by the shore, past<br/>
the bridge from runnyeye, (around -1000 to -2000) you can pull single<br/>
gnolls and kite them up and down the shore...but if you get any adds,<br/>
head for the bridge and zone...<br/>
<br/>
At 18, I learned the 2 instrument/3 song twist here, fighting 2-4 gnolls<br/>
at a time.  It&#39;s easy xp then...<br/>

&gt; Back to EQ-related questions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you think a Bard can survive in EK at 16?  Solo?<br/>
