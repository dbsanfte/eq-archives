<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326364039"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Mithril Breastplate not that good?  Show me a better breastplate that bards<br/>
&gt; can wear short of Imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I thought we went over this before?  The agi boost from the MithBP<br/>
  does not make up for the ac3 it is lacking from the Lambent.  Not<br/>
  to mention sta5 and hp25 is greater than hp30.  The LambentBP exceeds<br/>
  the MithBP enough statwise and color/match/looking good (which counts<br/>
  a lot in my opinion) to be worn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Easy to aquire?  Well, if you&#39;re level 40+, sure ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  RMB have really flooded the market lately... they are everywhere.<br/>
  Not easy to loot perhaps, easy to get hands on one ;)<br/>
