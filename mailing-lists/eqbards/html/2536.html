&gt; Over the weekend I started a Bard on the test server.  I have to say the<br/>
&gt; wide open spaces are nice, zoned into West Karana and I was the only one<br/>
&gt; there :)  The highest level Bard I have seen (via /w bard all) has been 18th<br/>
&gt; level. Anyone else out there playing a Bard on Test?  Would be nice to have<br/>
&gt; a partner, I am currently 5th level and in the Qeynos area.<br/>
<br/>

usually very empty.<br/>

Did you notice the &quot;new bard songs&quot; on any vendors?<br/>
