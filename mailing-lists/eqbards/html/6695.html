<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The biggest problem with Bards at later levels, IMO is that most groups<br/>
&gt;(at least on our server) go to item distribution based on need, rather<br/>
&gt;than the various schemes like alpha used by lower levels. I believe this<br/>
&gt;is used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard is known as<br/>
&gt;a mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the weapons we<br/>
&gt;can use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we have no bard<br/>
&gt;only weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>
&gt;the item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>
&gt;Ykesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;making as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>

Well you could always resort to extoration *evil grin*. Casters yell &quot;Play <br/>
the mana song&quot;, Bard replies &quot;oh I dememed that, how about a nice Hymn of <br/>
Restoration&quot; :p<br/>
