<div id="ygrps-yiv-871591164">IIRC - Blue & some even to me at 35/36 - a 45/46 sham pal was camping them<br/>
with a 39 ench. Or some times his hi 30 lo 40 ranger buds. The camp spawns 3<br/>
each with doggy (or maybe 2 doggys).  The ench did something ench like to<br/>
pull a single and the camp was easily broken.  I am pretty sure they were<br/>
blue because I thot &quot;hmm, dis would be a great spot without all these high<br/>
levs spongin&#39; up all me xp!  Dey are only blues and if I can lull them we<br/>
can pull singles...&quot;<br/>
<br/>

stick!  And I did not sitck (around) either - ZONE!!  (this is in Lake Rathe<br/>
