&gt; Petitioning won&#39;t get you very far in that situation, seeing as how their<br/>

&gt; &quot;owns&quot; a monster.  Whether you agree or not with that doesn&#39;t really matter<br/>
&gt; either, because it&#39;s their current policy and unless it changes, you&#39;re just<br/>

monsters there, and the bigger guys keep taking it every time.<br/>
In this case, their misguided harassment definition (only<br/>
harassment if it&#39;s aimed at an individual) works in your<br/>
favor since they are literally killing everything you attack.<br/>
