<b>Subject:</b> Re: SoW vs. Selo&#39;s Accelerando <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-58101686">I&#39;ve done some experimenting in this regard, as there is a druid in my<br/>
party and I played with druids a great deal in beta.  When both of you<br/>
are around level 14, Spirit of the Wolf is faster than Selo&#39;s without a<br/>
drum.  With a drum, Selo&#39;s is faster.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ve never tested it, but we seem to get faster as we go up in<br/>
levels, while Sprit of the Wolf seems to stay constant despite the level<br/>
of the druid or shaman.  It could be that at a high level, we&#39;re faster<br/>
than SoW even without a drum.  <br/>
<br/>
I doubt we&#39;re ever faster than Spirit of Cheetah though.<br/>
<br/>
Some experiments in this regard would be interesting, if anyone wants to<br/>
take them on.<br/>
