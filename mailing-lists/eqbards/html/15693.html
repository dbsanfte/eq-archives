For wind songs, drop your dragoon dirk or a throwing knife or fs dagger into<br/>
your ranged wep slot while the song is playing - what that looks like I<br/>
shall leave to the imagination of the viewers &lt;eg&gt;.  For string or<br/>
percussion songs, while the song is playing, lift and drop your runed bone<br/>
fork.  Then you will strum your &quot;axe&quot; &lt;vbg&gt; I like to tell people that I am<br/>
playing my fav Hendrix tunes...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All along the watchtower.<br/>
The wind began to howl...&quot;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure someone&#39;s done this, but the other day I was recovering my corpse<br/>
&gt; in Mistmoore, looted my Minotaur Horn, sang Shauri&#39;s, and finished looting<br/>
&gt; everything else, including putting my Runed Bone Fork into my ranged<br/>
weapon<br/>
&gt; slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Runed Bone Fork, replaced the graphic of my horn, and left me looking<br/>
&gt; like I was standing around writhing, holding a spear which was sticking<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; the back of my head!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not so much of an Easter Egg as a bug, but it was amusing. </span></blockquote></div>
