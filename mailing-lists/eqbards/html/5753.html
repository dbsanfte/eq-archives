&gt;JM Cappozi (sp?) is/was a beta tester who got to be close friends with the<br/>
&gt;dev team.  Go back and re-read his posts - NEVER does he claim to be a<br/>
&gt;programmer (that I saw) but the detail and quality of his information made<br/>
&gt;it sure seem like he - himself had to be a Verant employee.  But really --<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s something that _we_ super-imposed on him.<br/>

posting regularly there....<br/>
