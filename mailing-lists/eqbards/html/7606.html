<div id="ygrps-yiv-601143975"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Not a bad idea, but 30-50% health would be better<br/>
&gt;in my personal opinion. 50 hp to a high level<br/>
&gt;player out of their total of over 1000 would<br/>
&gt;simply be unrealistic. But it&#39;s a good idea<br/>
&gt;all the same.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would look at it as a you have just been revived off your deathbed and are<br/>
very weak.  Keeping it that low would certainly remove that, die, repop with<br/>
full heal attack syndrome.  On a similar note, I feel when we die all<br/>
players should repop with zero mana.<br/>

Boy would that make them cry.</div>
