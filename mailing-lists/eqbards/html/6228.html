<div id="ygrps-yiv-932921454">Hello Telania, and welcome to the list.  This is the most informative and<br/>
least argumentative EQ list I&#39;ve belonged to and I enjoy it thoroughly.  I<br/>
hope you do too!<br/>
<br/>
No, I would strongly advise against Unrest for you at 14th/15th.  I went there<br/>
at 17th and again at 18th and decided that it was still just a bit too much<br/>
for me, even in the yard.  As has been noted here already, the trains in there<br/>
are some of the worst in the game.  And these are not BlackBurrow type trains<br/>
where there is a great many monsters that vary in level from 6th to 15th or<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem is that bards attract a lot of unwanted attention.  You&#39;ll<br/>
read some about that here but you&#39;ve probably discovered it on your own.<br/>
Monsters tend to jump you first and hardest because you&#39;re singing affects the<br/>
entire group that you&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
When Unrest trains badly, which is usually about once every hour and a half or<br/>
so, the basement empties onto the lawn through the back door and chases<br/>
virtually everyone to the zone leaving a wake of player corpses.  These<br/>
monsters vary in level from low teens (Death Beetles, Tortured Dead) all the<br/>
way up to the mid 30s (Skeletal Monks, Barbed Skeletons, Ice Bone Skeletons,<br/>
Undead Barkeep, Unrest Nobles, Tentacle Terrors, Mortuary Fungus, and the<br/>
&lt;shiver&gt; Festering Hags).  It&#39;s best to go there (in my opinion) at such level<br/>
that when (not if) these basement trains occur you have at least a chance of<br/>
escaping alive.  My bard was dying to them at 17th and 18th so I moved on.  I<br/>
will definitely go back there when I&#39;m, say, 22nd or so and kill stuff inside<br/>
the house.  The experience and loot are both good in Unrest, but the really<br/>
good loot is inside the house.<br/>
<br/>
An example:<br/>
I have a 23rd level monk that was tanking in Unrest for my group.  Monks have<br/>
MEND, which heals 25% of our hit points when pressed and recycles every six<br/>
minutes.  I am a very experienced pulling in Unrest so I was pulling through<br/>
the side door to my group various stuff.  My monk has about 700HPs.  With full<br/>
health I ran in and pulled a Skeletal Monk and a Carrion Ghoul out of the<br/>
house to my group.  About the time I got out of the house and to the wall I<br/>
saw the infamous message &quot;A festering hag begins to cast a spell.&quot;  I spin<br/>
around to see if she&#39;s nearby.  No, she&#39;s not; I don&#39;t see her anywhere.  I<br/>
then try to run toward one of the mobs that I pulled and think to myself &quot;What<br/>
the hell?  I&#39;m moving slowly as if I were encumbered!&quot;  I quickly look up to<br/>
my health bar and it&#39;s on empty.  WHAT!?!?  As quickly as I can I slap my MEND<br/>
button, but I&#39;m dead before my hand gets to the &#39;6&#39; key.  Two Festering Hags<br/>
had hit me with spells from inside the house through walls (I wish my Wizards<br/>
could do that, huh?) and I died in under three seconds.  I had to scroll back<br/>
through the messages after I respawned in Kaladim to even figure out what had<br/>
killed me.  I didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
All that sounds really discouraging, huh?  Well I don&#39;t mean to be.  When<br/>
you&#39;re high enough level that you have a hope of escaping one of those trains,<br/>
Unrest is great fun and good loot too.  Definitely go there, you&#39;ll have a<br/>
blast.<br/>

&gt; Hi.  I stumbled upon this list and I&#39;m so glad I found it. I wish I had<br/>
known about it sooner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Telania, prior 15th lvl bard lady.::pouts::  I died shortly after<br/>
hitting my new mark in HighPass.. (them dumb Orcs).  I was thinking of heading<br/>
to Unrest with my RL hubby who is a 14th lvl WE Warrior.  But after reading<br/>
about Unrest I dont&#39; think we&#39;re ready.  Sounds like we need to mature just a<br/>
tad bit more.. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ANYWAY, now that i&#39;ve side tracked.. where is a good spot for my lvl to be?<br/>
I&#39;ve taken other suggestions like one,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;go to kerra isle! Good loot and easy&quot;. uh, They like forgot to mention<br/>
Trains.  Died quiet harshly I might add. eh<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I will ask my brethen.. HELP?! hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any and all would be appriecated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thank you<br/>
