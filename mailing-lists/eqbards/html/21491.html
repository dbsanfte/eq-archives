<div id="ygrps-yiv-696772931">Does he expect anyone to believe they JUST found this?  and can anyone find<br/>
that post from way back where he said that they would not make any changes<br/>
that seriously upset the balance of the game so far into it?  cause this<br/>
sure as hell does.  sigh...<br/>

&gt; In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after <br/>
&gt; tomorrow. We found a <br/>
&gt; bug with the way &quot;haste&quot; items stack with &quot;haste&quot; spells. <br/>
&gt; Basically, even <br/>
&gt; the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell <br/>
&gt; would put the <br/>
&gt; wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the <br/>
&gt; better haste items <br/>
&gt; and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the <br/>
&gt; newer haste <br/>
&gt; items aren&#39;t any better than the FBSS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is being fixed in tomorrow&#39;s patch. </span></blockquote></div>
