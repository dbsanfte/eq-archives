<br/>
Well, from what I saw last night, you get the great speed up with the<br/>
enchanter buffs.  Fighting dw gobs, I have to fear then chain: fear then<br/>
CoC: rinse repeat.  If I went with a 3 song mix, a fail on a fear would<br/>
allow the gobs a chance to cast.  Some were smart enough to cast heals;<br/>
others would take their one opportunity to nuke me (in three days of<br/>
fighting these guys, I think that they have made me zone 4 or 5 times.) Once<br/>
I switched over to spectres and stayed buffed with aug, I could &quot;see&quot; the<br/>
difference in how fast the screen messages were coming -- *very* much<br/>
faster!  With Aug, my sta was no problem with 6 Note & Yk. Without Aug, I<br/>
would burn a whole bar of sta in a fight (or would play jig.)<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting to know if this &#39;effect&#39; of going to 75% if bard or<br/>
ench buffed, carries for all of the PoA haste belts (rangers and wars and<br/>
??)<br/>
<br/>
As tired as I am of mashing buttons to get multiple song effects, I think<br/>
that I would be opposed to any system that automates it *unless* you have<br/>
the opportunity to go back to manual instantly.  Let&#39;s say that they give a<br/>
&quot;song book&quot; and we can specify which 3 songs to be played.  Now what if you<br/>
choose: fear, chain, chords.  And now what if fear fails?  I for one would<br/>
not just blindly play the next song.  When it fade on the mob and it takes<br/>
it turn to hit you, stunned!  You cannot play songs when stunned.  Then when<br/>
you recover, you would not want merely the next song because you will just<br/>
get stunned again.  So, there would need to be and immediate manual over<br/>
ride available.  It&#39;s not the sort of thing that I would expect Verant to<br/>
understand in their design.  I am scared they take the gem of an idea and<br/>
implement it poorly and then refuse to fix it after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
Also, manually doing songs gives you the flexibility to switch according to<br/>
a dynamic battle.  Yes, too many hours in Sol-B and where the AE DoT&#39;s are<br/>
great on the first 3 mobs you get, but the bard needs to be able to switch<br/>
to pixie to handle the next 2 that get trained in when you healers are<br/>
screaming LOM and OOM!  So, I sure hate all the button pushing but in the<br/>
real battles, I think we need it as an option.  Play 3 songs - set and<br/>
forget would be nice but... OMG!  Where did those 6 bats come from?  ZONE!<br/>
SCREETCH!!! ZONE!<br/>

&gt; I got this belt this weekend in PoA.  I tested it (tried to<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Combined with *any* bard speedup, it puts me at 75% speedup.<br/>
&gt; My hunch is it&#39;ll do the same combined with any enchanter<br/>
&gt; speedup, including augmentation. </span></blockquote></div>
