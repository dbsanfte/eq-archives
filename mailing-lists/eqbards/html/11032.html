&gt; ...  The most fun thing to do for a 50 is to twink a char and<br/>
&gt; play that char for awhile. I still don&#39;t have a problem with twinking and I<br/>
&gt; never  will.<br/>

me is when I go to an area that was designed for my character&#39;s level, in order to <br/>
earn an item that was intended to be used by my character&#39;s level, only to find it <br/>
camped by players 10-15 levels higher than me.<br/>
<br/>
As one of the modestly-developing players on my server (I started April 1st, and am <br/>
only level 34), it has always really irritated me to have zones that are intended <br/>
for players of my level cluttered with players who should have gone somewhere else, <br/>
but are too lazy or too chicken.  <br/>
<br/>
When those players are joined by players who are bored, and who are camping the <br/>
areas in order to give items that I now cannot get to 5th level newbies, it ticks me <br/>
off.  This is not a twinking problem, per se, it is due to the lack of things for <br/>
level 50s to do.  Still, the net result is that I end up really resenting twinks who <br/>
are wearing things that I should have been able to get, but cannot (because there <br/>
are too many other people of much higher level than me, with much more time on their <br/>
hands than I have, cluttering up the zones).  I know that the level 50s will say <br/>
that they have a right to do this, and they do.  It still stinks for me, though.<br/>
