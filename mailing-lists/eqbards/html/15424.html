<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697063149">I refuse to get into a flame war over this.  But suffice to say I&#39;ve seen<br/>
some of the pseudo code that they have thrown around.  It&#39;s not that they&#39;re<br/>
bad coders.  It&#39;s that they&#39;re good coders who are under far too much<br/>
time-pressure.  I don&#39;t care how good you are, if you have a 24 hour project<br/>
and are forced to kick it out the door in 5 hours there are going to be bad<br/>
mistakes, or errors in it.<br/>
<br/>
I *know* some of the people involved in developing the pseudo code for the<br/>
patches that go in.  The pseudocode is good but it makes some broad<br/>
assumptions without having tested certain aspects.  IE:  Aggroing by<br/>
accident etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the _programmers_ fault.  Hell, I used to be one myself, and even<br/>
the fabulous Brian Hook has made mistakes from time to time ;)  I&#39;m not<br/>
saying they are bad.  I&#39;m saying they&#39;re under way too much pressure which<br/>
results in collosal errors.<br/>
<br/>
Big example:  Everyone in Beta said that EQ was NOT ready for final in March<br/>
when they went to release.  Everyone.  Sony and Verant did so anyway.  Even<br/>
the programmers (the few I knew anyway) said there were still a lot of<br/>
things they didn&#39;t feel were &#39;finished&#39;.<br/>

&gt; right on!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the programmers always get blamed. I can tell you as a matter of fact that<br/>
&gt; most of the poor practices implemented in my code are not of my own<br/>
volition<br/>
&gt; but rather because I was told by a producer &quot;do it this way, that&#39;s what<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; and so decided&quot;. At that point, I find that the producer generally has<br/>
&gt; complete resistance to logic or perssuation and the issue is promptly<br/>
&gt; closed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blame the designers or the middle men that approve the designer&#39;s<br/>
decisions,<br/>
&gt; but don&#39;t turn on the poor lowly programmers, it&#39;s probably not thier<br/>
doing.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve seen this stated a bunch...you&#39;ve never seen the code, correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree that the interface interaction is incredibly Diku-like, but I<br/>
&gt; imagine<br/>
&gt; this is similar to Bioware using the D&D game architecture, not the old<br/>
Gold<br/>
&gt; Box<br/>
&gt; code.<br/>
&gt; The game design is obviously based on Diku muds, but the code probably<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; After all, even adapting a Diku code base for a game like EQ would make it<br/>
&gt; pretty unrecognizable, IMHO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a monstrous package, but the amount of real game stopping bugs is<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; minimal.  Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out<br/>
&gt; logistics,<br/>
&gt; not code.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers,<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; doubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to<br/>
blame<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; coders rather than the designers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have,<br/>
too<br/>
&gt; :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my .02<br/>
&gt; Golias, Sol Ro<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ===============<br/>
&gt; Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>
&gt; tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>
&gt; extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally<br/>
support<br/>
&gt; either opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>
&gt; prowess.<br/>
