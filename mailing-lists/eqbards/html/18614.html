<b>Subject:</b> Re: Guilds or not--Dragons and other raids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-219298161">Folks on Tunare do it all the time.  They may have<br/>
guild members that they draw off, but there are many<br/>
raids that are &quot;thrown together&quot; in less than a week<br/>
with people not of the same guild.  Tunare has a<br/>
pretty active board on the EZBoard newsgroups.  One of<br/>
the categories is &quot;Dragons and Planes&quot;.  Someone who<br/>
wants to organize a  raid and get others can just post<br/>
out there the time and day of the event and get people<br/>
to sign up.  Sure there may be some no shows or<br/>
whatever, but I think it works fairly well.  It does<br/>
probably take a number of experienced raid members to<br/>
pull it off (especially the organizer) but it<br/>
certainly can be done.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, certainly it&#39;s possible to organize and pull off<br/>
&gt; a non-guild <br/>
&gt; event like this, there are many obstacles in place<br/>
&gt; making it <br/>
&gt; extremelly difficult.  I wonder if any dragon or<br/>
&gt; plane has been <br/>
&gt; successfully done without a guild of some kind<br/>
&gt; organizing it.<br/>
