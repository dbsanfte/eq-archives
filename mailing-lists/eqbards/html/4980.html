<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154230310">All creatures I have ever met /con within a range of 3 levels.  Like, rogue<br/>
clockworks are level 8 11 or so.  I&#39;m not sure if this changes at higher<br/>
levels, but I&#39;m seeing the same thing with creatures up to level 21 at least<br/>
(I have a 19 warrior).<br/>

&gt; Although I have no empirical evidence to back it up, I would imagine that<br/>
&gt; Verant will continue to tweak the difficultly of mobs as the average<br/>
&gt; character level on each server increases.  Granted there will always be<br/>
low<br/>
&gt; level characters on every server, but over time the average character<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; will increase.  This could be Verant&#39;s method to help prevent overcrowding<br/>
&gt; by ensuring there are enough creatures around to give experience.  Just a<br/>
&gt; speculation on my part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One other thing to consider, when a creature spawns, there are a range of<br/>
&gt; levels they could be.  Last night I was camping the pirate captain in the<br/>
&gt; OOT who drops the Bracer of Erollisi.  The first time he spawned he conned<br/>
&gt; dark blue to me (21 bard).  The second time he spawned, he was black to me<br/>
&gt; (same level).  The third time he spawned he was yellow.  This could have<br/>
&gt; been what happened to you in Steamfont with the skeletons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a<br/>
big<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and<br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>
