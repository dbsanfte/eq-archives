<b>Subject:</b> Do I ever have a chance at making high level? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676339578">I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player (maybe a couple<br/>
hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>
Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>
each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>
hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>
mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or harder to level<br/>
in the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>
Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>
camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>
leave....<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
