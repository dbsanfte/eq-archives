<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097892665">Nope I was clawed to death.  I scrolled back my text window to see what<br/>
happened.  Several line is a row of &quot;Gorenaire claws you for 256 pts of<br/>
damage&quot;.  I literally went from full health to death in a microsecond.    <br/>

&gt; So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, attack anyone near<br/>
&gt; her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be you were hit by her AE, and since she &quot;chose&quot; to attack<br/>
you you were placed on her list of potential targets which, coupling with<br/>
the selfbuffing and low level/hp (relatively) that you had at the time,<br/>
turned her attention to you.<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t aggro on you being warmly at other times (I&#39;ve run up and said<br/>
hello plenty myself =), but while under attack all bets are off.<br/>
