As far as the duel weild thing goes, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
you can&#39;t cheat the delay in your second hand, as I<br/>
noticed when I went from pgt (6/22) to a cold iron<br/>
mornging star (9/35).   I was crushing a lot less than<br/>
I used to slash.  Of course, I wasn&#39;t actually timing,<br/>
and could have been intoxicated/sedated at the time. <br/>
In fact, just got an email this morning asking me if I<br/>
fell asleep in game last night :P<br/>
