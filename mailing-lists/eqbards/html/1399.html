<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150184677">I play Stargazer Erudite Enchanter on Fennin Ro almost exclusively.  <br/>
I have a Barbarian Shaman level 5 also on Fennin Ro but he&#39;s just sitting there waiting for me to get bored playing my enchanter.  <br/>
<br/>
In my frustration with the lack of role-playing on Fennin Ro, I started a bard on the PvP server (my first PvP experience) and ran him up to lvl 4 or 5, but the first couple of times I took him out of the newbie zone I found groups of level 8 dark elves sitting there PKing over and over again without so much as a nod to rp&#39;ing so I gave that up for the time being.  Is anyone playing a PvP bard.  Is this experience typical?<br/>
Any suggestions on how to stay alive?</div>
