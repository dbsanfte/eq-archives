&gt;I am a 12th level Bard on The Rathe. I now have roughly 65 skill in 1H <br/>
&gt;slashing and find myself wanting to explore other weapon types. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in about the same boat.  I&#39;ve been piercing things with a giant snake<br/>
fang, but I do indeed need to pierce something tougher than an orc pawn.<br/>
The bad news is that for a level or two now a lot of blue creatures have<br/>
been pretty scary solo.  I find I have to fight in a group that&#39;s tough<br/>
enough they don&#39;t need my better damage so I can practise my weaker skills.<br/>
 I&#39;ve got pierce up to 25 or so and still need to work a lot on 1H blunt.<br/>
