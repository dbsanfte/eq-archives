<b>Subject:</b> Lament rocks, lulaby sucks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101414036">Lament is one of the most powerful songs in our arsenel (if you can get your<br/>
group to let you pull that is).  Lulaby is a waste of time.  I prefer to<br/>
call it &quot;Kelin&#39;s suicide&quot; and I refuse to mem it.  I flat out told a party<br/>
they could all go solo nagafen before I&#39;d bother memming it when they told<br/>
me they wanted me to try it.<br/>

Kelin just suxors! :P  Personally, don&#39;t waste the time with the song<br/>
because I feel it will get you killed more than it will save your<br/>
butt.  Just my opinions ;)<br/>

&gt; Just who was this Kelin anyway?  Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit<br/>
of a problem figuring out what to do<br/>
&gt; with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of<br/>
discussion on the list about this song, but<br/>
&gt; usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>
write this since I got the darn song,<br/>
&gt; because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first<br/>
got that song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
&gt; all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve<br/>
leveled, it&#39;s become more useful.  I really<br/>
&gt; only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate<br/>
(knock on wood).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first<br/>
got it because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&gt; &quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small<br/>
group of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
&gt; Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot;<br/>
message.  Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song<br/>
just really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
&gt; wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I<br/>
thought I recalled from previous<br/>
&gt; discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So<br/>
why bother for just a few levels of<br/>
&gt; use?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any advice.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a<br/>
piece of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
&gt; soundly on the butt.<br/>
