<div id="ygrps-yiv-346687104">In a comparison for an offhand weapon, you&#39;re right, ratio is more important than speed.  Strictly for your offhand, the Saber will be better than the Partisan.  But, I think the Partisan might be fast enough to be better than the 14/24 Mace in your main hand.  If it is, then you&#39;re comparing the Mace and the Saber for the offhand and the Mace wins out easily.<br/>
<br/>
Copelands is a program that&#39;ll calculate how much damage weapons will produce over time.  Hopefully someone knows where to find it, because I don&#39;t remember where I downloaded it. :/<br/>
<br/>
If you can find it, I&#39;d compare the Partisan and the Mace and see which will put out more damage.  If the Partisan wins, then go with Partisan in main and Mace in secondary.  If the Mace wins, go with Mace in main and Saber in secondary.<br/>

BTW, I moved to Rubi&#39;Ka 2 as Kiod if you&#39;re looking for me over in AO. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Why the Partisan over the Saber -<br/>
  Saber 11/23 = .478<br/>
  Partisan 9/19 = .474<br/>
<br/>
  Is it the speed of 19 over the 23?  I thought ratio was more important than<br/>
  speed?<br/>
<br/>
  Also - what is Copelands?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks buddy<br/>

  If you&#39;re committed to using the Mace and Saber combo, I&#39;d put the Mace in<br/>
  primary.  Normally you want the fastest weapon in the main hand to take<br/>
  advantage of the primary hand damage bonus, but in this case I believe the<br/>
  better ratio of the mace will make it superior to the saber.  If I were you,<br/>
  tho, I&#39;d use the Partisan in main and the Mace in offhand... I believe<br/>
  that&#39;ll give you a higher damage output overall (19 Delay fast weapon in<br/>
  primary and great ratio weapon in secondary).  Reserve the Saber for<br/>
  situations where you don&#39;t want aggro.<br/>
<br/>
  You may want to verify my recommendations on Copelands just to be sure,<br/>
  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a proc message, but for the life of me I can&#39;t remember what it is<br/>
  atm.<br/>
<br/>

    I have the following:<br/>
    Guardians Mace 1HB 14/24 Proc: Guard (24 or so Cleric AC Buff)<br/>
    Symphonic Saber 1HS 11/23 CHA+10 Int+5 Symphonic Harmony<br/>
<br/>
    Which should go in the primary and which in secondary?  The Mace has a<br/>
    better Ratio - but I thought someone posted faster weap should be in<br/>
    primary.  Also - the mace procs CONSTANTLY.<br/>
<br/>
    Anyone know if there&#39;s a message for the proc on the Saber?  I just got it<br/>
    and haven&#39;t been able to tell.<br/>
<br/>
    Lastly - I was previously using the Guardians in primary and a Sioniches<br/>
    Partisan (Piercing 9/19 Cha+6 Int+2 Sv Magic+5) in my offhand - and don&#39;t<br/>
    see any reason to hang on to it.  Any Xegony guys know what&#39;s worth and<br/>
    anyone who may want to buy it?<br/>
