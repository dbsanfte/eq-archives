<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-557054398">Well, I couldent get any info and that to me is a call to action.  It seems<br/>
there are very few people who have spent the time to work on their begging<br/>
skill.  I have taken it upon myself to master this skill and document the<br/>
results.  So if anyone is interested here is what I have found....<br/>
<br/>
First I have spend all of my available practice points on begging.  (about<br/>
37)  This put my skill up to 39.<br/>
<br/>
Starting about a week ago.<br/>
I started begging farmers in East Karana (conned green).  I used the<br/>
Charasmatic Carrilion on them first with mino horn.  I begged constantly for<br/>
over an hour with only 2 successes.  Each of which got me one dull copper<br/>
piece and no skill increases :(  <br/>
<br/>
I then tried begging blue, yellow, and red NPC&#39;s.  I begged for another<br/>
several hours over the course of the week.  Never seeing any successes, or<br/>
skill increases.  <br/>
<br/>
I also spent a good amount of time begging the boat to Odus.  (as was<br/>
mentioned before you need to stand by the mast) and the boats in Lake Rath.<br/>
These attempts did not increase my skill at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried giving NPCs silver pieces before I beg.  In the chance that<br/>
they might not give me money if they dont have any.  No luck.<br/>
<br/>
I have also developed an intresting bard technique, where I will target an<br/>
NPC while running with Selo&#39;s.  Then right when I wizz by them I will hit my<br/>
Beg hot key.  I ususally use this on red NPC&#39;s and while near a zone :)<br/>
<br/>
For the record.  I have begged hundreds of times now and while I have only<br/>
recieved coppers perhaps 4 times.  I have never been attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Then when I was wizzing by a green farmer in North Karana. I recieved a<br/>
beautiful copper piece and a lovely skill increase up to 40.  wow.<br/>
<br/>
Now all of this seems fruitless for the most part.  But I must find out if<br/>
the rumors about master beggers getting multiple platnum or fine steel<br/>
weapons from NPCs.  I must know.  I must.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond with your comments or information if you have any.  Please<br/>
... :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
