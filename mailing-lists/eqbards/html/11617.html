<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810652458">The first time I walked all the way from the zone to 4C in Cazic I wasn&#39;t<br/>
attacked.  I conned everything along the way and everything was indifferent.<br/>
Next time I walked thru I assumed I was safe and didn&#39;t con any lizards as I<br/>
moved.  I walked by a lizard in the maze and got attacked.  The best<br/>
explanation I have to why it saw thru the invis was that the lizard had the<br/>
see invis spell buff.  I don&#39;t know if lizard spellcasters can actually cast<br/>
this spell but if they can that would easily explain it.  If they can&#39;t cast<br/>
see invis then I have no idea what happened.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>
&gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>
&gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>
&gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>
&gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>
&gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>
&gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>
&gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>
&gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>
&gt; it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>
&gt; this, please do so.<br/>
