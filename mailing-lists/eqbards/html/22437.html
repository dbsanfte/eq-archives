Ooh!  Unpack, Paint, and Hang Curtains!  I&#39;ve played that!  Here was my<br/>
strategy:<br/>
<br/>
Attack the paint first.  Twist Largo&#39;s Consonant Chain to ensure no drip<br/>
marks spawn.  Do NOT use Binding.  You do not want to reduce the AC of<br/>
paint, trust me.  Also twist Vilia&#39;s Chorus of Celerity and Jig O&#39; Vigor to<br/>
ensure all the paint is dealt with before boxes or curtains start to spawn.<br/>
I did this wielding a brush in my primary and can in my off-hand.  This<br/>
meant occasionally twisting Aria of Eagles in order to secure the zone.<br/>
But if you can afford it, go to Greater Fay and buy a two-handed,<br/>
rechargeable, extended handle paint applicator.  It&#39;s more reliable than<br/>
the Aria and will allow you to twist Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision as needed<br/>
if any of your group members go out looking for boxes too soon.<br/>
<br/>
Next attack the curtains.  Some would argue boxes should be dealt with<br/>
next, but I&#39;ve found that by the time you&#39;ve attacked all the curtains in a<br/>
particular zone you invariably find more paint spawn points that you missed<br/>
the first time.  And you want all the paint out of the way before you<br/>
tackle the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
For curtains, use Aria of Eagles, Psalm of Cooling (Curtains have pets<br/>
called Drafts which are very low-level but can make attacking the curtains<br/>
an aggravating experience), and Celerity.   It is rumored that the level 49<br/>
song was to be Fufil&#39;s Curtaining Chant, but that Verant didn&#39;t feel bards<br/>
should be allowed to corner the market on Interior Decorating.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, attack the boxes.  Break the spawns carefully.  An uncontrolled<br/>
train of boxes is a very, very scary thing.  And they have a remarkable way<br/>
of blocking the exits.<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well with the boxes, you should be able to control the zone<br/>
using Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, and Verses<br/>
of Celerity.  (Due to the need to frequently jump or climb over boxes, the<br/>
agility buff of VoC makes it a better choice than the pure haste effect of<br/>
CoC)<br/>
<br/>
If the boxes begin spawning uncontrollably, immediately stop your haste<br/>
song.  Twist instead Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric, Cataloging Libretto, and<br/>
Solidarity of Vision.  (It is believed Lyssa did most of her composing<br/>
while attacking boxes).<br/>
<br/>
When all the boxes are dealt with, sing Cantana of Replenishment.  Your<br/>
party will appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>
