<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862908746">I agree.  I only mix in Hymn with Clarity anymore when I&#39;m feeling like<br/>
topping everyone off that last little sliver that the Clerics/Druids/Shaman<br/>
can really do.  But to be perfectly honest, after 40+ levels of mashing the<br/>
buttons, it&#39;s kinda nice to just sit back after a battle and be the mana<br/>
pump.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing - I think it was Sylly a few days back who mentioned carrying<br/>
Jasper and Peridot around with her for the Clerics in her groups.  I started<br/>
doing this, and when I hand them over to the Cleric and everyone gets<br/>
Symboled you&#39;d think *I* was the Cleric.  Man.  If you wanna be popular with<br/>
groups carry Symbol reagents appropriate to your level around with you.<br/>
Very good tip Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
Clerical Symbol Reagents at levels:<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
Level 14: Cat&#39;s Eye Agate<br/>
Level 24: Bloodstone<br/>
Level 34: Jasper, ~9.5gp each<br/>
Level 44: Peridot, ~9.5pp each<br/>
<br/>
Buying a stack of 20 Peridots is nontrivial for all but the highest level<br/>
characters.  But like I was last night, if you&#39;re camping the Ballroom in<br/>
Mistmoore 9.5pp seems pretty inexpensive for the buff it gives.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   We need an analysis of Heal/Mana mix versus straight Mana with<br/>
&gt;   healers doing the Healing.  At higher levels it&#39;s not efficient<br/>
&gt;   enough to play Hymm on tanks who have up to 2000 hp.  With the<br/>
&gt;   pack regen spells, and word of health spells, it&#39;s definitely<br/>
&gt;   more efficient to go straight mana.  I&#39;m not sure about L35<br/>
&gt;   or less though.  I am the master of low downtime, but I&#39;m curious<br/>
&gt;   if around L35 it&#39;s better to twist both or play one.  I guess<br/>
&gt;   the all encompassing &#39;it depends&#39; rule applies here.  =)<br/>
