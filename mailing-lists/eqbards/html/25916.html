<div id="ygrps-yiv-579234520">You must have been AFK the other day.  You were standing outside Shar&#39;Val.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on 60!!  <br/>
<br/>
Currently, my guild isn&#39;t too keen on Grieg&#39;s End.  I walked in there invis<br/>
once, opened a door, and barely made it back out again.  I had less than a<br/>
100 hp when I zoned!<br/>
<br/>
Was real good seeing you.  Brings back memories of the elf hide gloves you<br/>
gave me, and the lambent stone when you were camping HG&#39;s...way back when<br/>
people could still get 10pp for them.  :)  I actually found a level 9 bard,<br/>
in mostly banded.  I gave him some elf hide gloves, as well as the BTC and<br/>
Silvery War Axe I used from my teens all the way to my 40&#39;s.  Couldn&#39;t sell<br/>
them, except to a vendor, and that seemed like such a waste.  Held them<br/>
forever in the bank...heh.  Hard to believe, a non-twink on Xegony.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made 51.  I then made the mistake, when nothing was going on, of<br/>
playing a mage character of mine from lvl 7 to 9.  Made the xp seem that<br/>
much slower when I was back on the bard later that day...heh.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m rambling now...back to work I go!  :)<br/>

Yes, I&#39;m still around. The list had gotten pretty quiet and I just hadn&#39;t<br/>
noticed it had started back up again. Suddenly I&#39;m wading thru 36 messages!<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing a couple nights a week, mostly weekends, and the good news<br/>
is I finally got 60 last Sunday night! I&#39;ve only been playing since beta, so<br/>
took me long enough, huh? We&#39;ve spent time exploring Luclin, still have a<br/>
couple zones to check out. Grieg&#39;s End rocks, if you haven&#39;t been there,<br/>
it&#39;s very Different.<br/>
At the risk of repeating a discussion, what&#39;s with Twilight, chains, charm,<br/>
etc being continuous cycle now? Grant you, I&#39;m not complaining but I have a<br/>
hard time believing VI did it on purpose.<br/>
