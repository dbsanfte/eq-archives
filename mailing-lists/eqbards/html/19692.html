&gt;Rogues,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They are by far the best friends of all Fear/snare capable classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unfortunatly, most newbies are scared that the rogue&#39;s are <br/>
&gt;stealing all thier copper that they cannot see<br/>
&gt;them for the tanks/damage dealers they are. The Pickpocket skill <br/>
&gt;is so misunderstood it is not even funny. </span></blockquote></div>
