<div id="ygrps-yiv-135806377">Everybody wants to raise strength, and the strength raising items are<br/>
expensive because of it.  So be smarter than everybody else and get items<br/>
that raise the stats that are lowered by being encumbered.  Or do what I<br/>
do... and get drunk.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a wiser move because you have a few songs that will throw<br/>
your strength well over 100 in battle (this should suffice for bonuses,<br/>
remove being encumbered) and with your other stats high from the items,<br/>
you&#39;ll be getting other bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
I have a thief friend who is amazing to watch.  Her agility is past 100, and<br/>
she is convinced that other rogues complain so much because most probably<br/>
are under the impression that strength is the ONE statistic, others<br/>
meaningless.  She is always avoiding blows, and wears many items to increase<br/>
her agility.  (O and how she loves backstabbing and my ability to taunt with<br/>
a lullaby)<br/>
<br/>
Just something to consider<br/>
