<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899957315">the only zoning issues i&#39;ve had is the bug where you die while zoning.<br/>
running out of the new paw i have died only to find myself zone and at the<br/>
safe spot, somewhere near the bard in South Karana.  strangely though, i did<br/>
not have full health.  i have yet to figure out how i had the number of hit<br/>
points i did.  i had somewhere around 80 hp, then i cast my shield spell on<br/>
myself and only went up to like 87hp, even though it normally adds a lot<br/>
more than 7hp.  so maybe something to do with dying and it taking into<br/>
account i had negative hp or something weird.  only John Kim really knows =)<br/>
