<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656922582">At your level the best xp is to be found in the basement in mostly the pit<br/>
area and the ghost area.  The bar room and the hand room will be very slow<br/>
xp for you at level 29.  The tower is pretty good xp at your level except<br/>
for that fact that the number of spawns is lacking.  There are only 3 or<br/>
so if the bar room is camped.  In the pit there are about 5-6 that spawn<br/>
in the pit  and about the same in the ghost room.  Just note that the hags<br/>
in those areas are pretty brutal.  2 or 3 nukes would finish me of when I<br/>
was 28-29.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; dying six times in two days and a lvl lower, my party,<br/>
&gt; in the same boat, has voted to hit Unrest, thinking we<br/>
&gt; might have better luck there.  (any suggestions on<br/>
&gt; hunting in Mistmoore? ... the alcove and graveyard<br/>
&gt; proved disasterous for my party lvls 22-29)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Questions:  If I am singing DDD on the second floor of<br/>
&gt; the House in Unrest, will I be pulling mobs on other<br/>
&gt; floors?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What part of Unrest is good for a mid/high 20s group?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all,<br/>
