<div id="ygrps-yiv-295641599">We debated this in the Soerbaird, and we brought it before a GM. Isara<br/>
explained the exact procedure, and a GM (not Guide) declared this completely<br/>
legal and by design.<br/>
<br/>
FYI we timed several instances of killing a red creature this way, and using<br/>
the same amount of time just sticking to blue/white we didn&#39;t have to run<br/>
from. There was no discernable difference in the amount of time spent. There<br/>
is a tedium to doing it each way. It takes a long time to killing a 15-16<br/>
level creature 8 hps at a time, but it can also be time-consuming to seek<br/>
out blues and whites that someone else isn&#39;t already getting. Each tactic<br/>
has it&#39;s moment and place. <br/>

Reading someone else&#39;s post about killing beetles in North Karana got me<br/>
thinking about an old debate I have often had with myself and others, namely<br/>
&quot;Is kiting bad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kiting, for those who don&#39;t know the term, means running along with a<br/>
monster<br/>
chasing you (like you&#39;re flying a kite) while damaging it somehow.  The idea<br/>
is<br/>
that the monster will never get close enough to hurt you, while you kill it.<br/>
For bards, this generally means Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, though you could<br/>
use<br/>
Chords or Denon&#39;s if you&#39;re feeling wacky.<br/>
<br/>
I first discovered kiting when they finally &quot;fixed&quot; the Bellow in beta.  I<br/>
say<br/>
fixed in quotes because they sort of broke it while they fixed it.  For a<br/>
long<br/>
time, the Bellow did not work.  When they finally made it functional, when I<br/>
was about level 15 or so, the first time I bellowed at something it did 37<br/>
points of damage.  (The bellow&#39;s damage has, of course, been toned down.<br/>
Now<br/>
at level 15 it does about 9 points)  The firepower of the thing was amazing.<br/>
I<br/>
decided to try it out on something big and nasty, so I went to Oasis and<br/>
discovered that I could kill crocodiles easily, without ever taking a point<br/>
of<br/>
damage.  I levelled in about 2 hours, without swinging my axe once.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds great eh?  The only problem was, I felt guilty doing it.  GMs<br/>
throughout<br/>
beta had made it clear that if you could kill a monster with no risk to<br/>
yourself at all, then you were exploiting.  I told myself, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not at<br/>
no<br/>
risk, what if the thing stuns me?  What if I run over a dune into a Sand<br/>
Giant?&quot; but it didn&#39;t wash with me.  These monsters had no chance.<br/>
<br/>
I love levelling as much as anyone.  I could have kited my way to level 50<br/>
maybe, who knows, all I needed was a nice white or yellow monster and room<br/>
to<br/>
run.  The thing was, I just couldn&#39;t live with it, from a conscience<br/>
perspective.  I stopped kiting.  I went toe to toe with things and got the<br/>
crap<br/>
beat out of me.  Maybe if I was pulling a monster to a safe place I&#39;d bellow<br/>
at<br/>
it as I ran, but that was it.  I felt better, but levelled slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Then the kiting word got out.  You couldn&#39;t go anywhere above ground in<br/>
Norrath<br/>
without seeing some bard, usually one I&#39;d never heard of before but who was<br/>
now<br/>
almost my level, running along with a monster occasionally pulsing yellow<br/>
behind him.  Every time I saw that, it made me a little mad, but I didn&#39;t<br/>
know<br/>
whether I was mad at me, Verant or the kiting bard.<br/>
<br/>
I still refuse to kite.  I don&#39;t let the druid in my party (druids kite<br/>
better<br/>
than anyone) kite.  I still think it&#39;s lame when I see someone kiting, but I<br/>
understand why they do it.<br/>
<br/>
The question is, am I alone in my beliefs here?  How do other bards out<br/>
there<br/>
feel about this?<br/>
