<div id="ygrps-yiv-977972894">Lot of good stuff is getting said in this thread.  Does anyone want to edit<br/>
it all and come up with a condensed version we can post on the official EQ<br/>
board? Hit the key topics and list pros/cons etc.  Title would be something<br/>
like &quot;How to Implement a Dungeon Crawl in EQ&quot; or &quot;Dungeon Crawls vs<br/>
Camping&quot;.    Would be interesting to see if Verant gave us their opinion on<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt; killing everything just to see what items are dropped even though they<br/>
&gt; probably won&#39;t want any of them.  Just use a little reverse planar logic<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; code the zone to not allow in players of over X level where X is 12 levels<br/>

&gt; wouldn&#39;t get xp anyhow running in to farm stuff.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, maybe I&#39;m just cynical, but wouldn&#39;t this degenerate?  I imagine a<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; 50 in a level 30 dungeon like Sol A running around killing everything that<br/>
&gt; moves.  There is an advantage to camping a spawn area for those of us who<br/>
&gt; are interested in XP as much if not more the items... you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; share the mobs with other groups.  For me, dungeons have always been the<br/>
&gt; best place to get XP, not items.  Ever try Sol B on a crowded night?  Try<br/>
&gt; sitting in the noble room when there is a group in the circle room, pool<br/>
&gt; room and kings room.  See how many spawns you get.  Not many.  Now imagine<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; dungeon where the good spawns can be anywhere or there are multiples...<br/>
&gt; suddenly all those groups camping a particular area are suddenly running<br/>
&gt; around and taking any spawns anywhere rather then sticking to there own<br/>
&gt; marked off area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, even worse, imagine if the Goblin King in Sol A could happen to<br/>
&gt; spawn<br/>
&gt; anywhere... what would those level 25&#39;s do who are fighting Cinders and<br/>
&gt; Youngs when the King suddenly spawns and bum rushes them.  The rare spawns<br/>
&gt; are deep in the dungeon on purpose...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Granted, the way they set up Paw is kind of nice since there are no named<br/>
&gt; spawns and you seem to have an equal chance of getting a drop whether or<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; you are at the entrance or deep inside... but man the magic items dropped<br/>
&gt; there just plain suck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally I kinda like the way AC handles it by restricting dungeons to<br/>
&gt; certain levels and having a lot more dungeons... if you aren&#39;t in a level<br/>
&gt; range you cannot enter.  I&#39;d also like to see all really really good items<br/>
&gt; taken out of the rare spawns hands and moved to time consuming lengthy<br/>
&gt; quests.  I think what they did with Lambent, Crafted, etc as a replacement<br/>
&gt; for Rubicite worked pretty darn well.  Granted there is still camping for<br/>
&gt; Lambent items for example, but it is restricted to a single class fighting<br/>
&gt; RANDOM spawns for a single item... Rather then having to go and kill some<br/>
&gt; named spawn to get an item, I&#39;d like to see it that I have to kill a level<br/>
&gt; 30 goblin mage to get boots, then a level 30 cyclops to get a rune and<br/>
&gt; finally a giant or griffon to get a lambent stone is a much better<br/>
&gt; approach<br/>
&gt; then a single level 30 rare spawn.   Imagine instead if I had to kill a 4<br/>
&gt; different level 50 mobs in 4 different dungeons or settings to get a YK<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it was usable by bards only and every other class had there own level 50<br/>
&gt; mobs that they needed to kill to get their own class specific weapons...<br/>
&gt; How often do you see non-bards camping for firewalker boots?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking of the KS&#39;ing crowd, though indirectly.  A druid or<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tracker could just sit by while people wandered about killing stuff<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the single named mob showed up race to it and have a fair chance of<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there first as the people who cleared the way for it have moved on to<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; areas and are likely in a fight when the special spawns.  If there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twelve different specials it would make it that much harder for the<br/>
&gt; &quot;tracker<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the shadows&quot; to just rush over and nab the special when it popped<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; likely several specials would be popping up at any given time if the<br/>
&gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has a fair amount of explorers in it.  Since the container guy doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; move,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, having 12 different specials would make it 12x harder<br/>
&gt; &gt; (assuming no change in rare spawn frequency) for a kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; stealer to get the special item.  It also makes it 12x harder<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the group to get the special item.  They cancel out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, maybe the group gets to see who the kill stealer(s) is<br/>
&gt; &gt; before they lose the item.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, that was why I said maybe the named mob should just<br/>
&gt; &gt; drop on top of your while you are fighting.  It doesn&#39;t reward<br/>
&gt; &gt; the parasitic opportunists that way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Speaking of mobs dropping on top of you...  My paladin friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; was soloing a bit in LGuk a couple nights ago.  He was<br/>
&gt; &gt; fighting in the halls (dead side).  He&#39;d fight one mob, other<br/>
&gt; &gt; people&#39;s pulls would ignore him.  I joined him.  Other<br/>
&gt; &gt; people&#39;s pulls saw the bard singing a song, and decided they<br/>
&gt; &gt; hated the bard more than the person pulling them.  Bleh.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; just assumed all this time that mobs other people were pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt; would attack you if they saw you fighting another mob (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;help a friend&quot; AI).  I didn&#39;t realize it only happened to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards.<br/>
