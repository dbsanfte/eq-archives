<div id="ygrps-yiv-282347474">Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
weapons...<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>
