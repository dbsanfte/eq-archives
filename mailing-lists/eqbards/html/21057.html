I know it was somewhere on the whineplay general forum, but with the<br/>
servers currently down I can&#39;t connect to it with all the traffic.<br/>

song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target<br/>
mes song) be fixed?] <br/>

Gord&#39;o:<br/>
Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some other<br/>
things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding<br/>
chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell. <br/>

&gt;I&#39;m very annoyed by GZ&#39;s comments stating Ester was yanked from our problem.<br/>
