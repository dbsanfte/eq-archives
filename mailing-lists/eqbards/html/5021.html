<div id="ygrps-yiv-959268280">I think I can pretty much confirm that Mystic Clouding used to make us<br/>
invisible to undead as well as the living, (AND our fellow group members)<br/>
but in the last 2 days the undead have seen me consistently while singing<br/>
it.  If anyone else want to test this out or has similar experience with<br/>
this, let us know.<br/>
<br/>
It was a typical strategy for me when visiting unrest to go invis right<br/>
outside the zone, zone in, restart the song, and start shouting for a group<br/>
and wandering around the courtyard and walls.  This way I would be left<br/>
alone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with<br/>
something like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join<br/>
them, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from<br/>
the basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.  Not<br/>
anymore :-(  Looks like this Bard needs to learn to be a bit more careful<br/>
from now on.<br/>
