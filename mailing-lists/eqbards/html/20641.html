<div id="ygrps-yiv-609779475">To prove it to the group.  You alone camp out.  Sing no songs when you<br/>
return and happily run about in obvious chase range of mobs.  Then let the<br/>
other group members go into chase range one at a time until something<br/>
auto-pulls.  That&#39;s the guy on the lists.  If you pulse a song on him you<br/>
too will be on all those lists.<br/>

*waves to Kenross*  Hullo :)  I had an issue like there at the Sarknak Fort<br/>
in the Lake of Ill Omen.  We just stood there and everything ran to us -<br/>
well me.  Every mob came at me :) but then I could not blame them I am just<br/>
so cute.  Ummm anyways... My group started to yell for me to log so I did.<br/>
Me alone.  And guess what happened?  The mobs still came and they started to<br/>
beat on the cleric instead.  *LOL* He screams like a girl - ON ME ON ME.<br/>
Don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever going to ask me to log again...<br/>
