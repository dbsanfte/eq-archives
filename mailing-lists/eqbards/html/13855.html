<div id="ygrps-yiv-410218937">You&#39;d also need to make it so the boss wouldn&#39;t spawn unless there were no<br/>
PC&#39;s in his entire section of the dungeon to further dislodge the campers.<br/>
I like the idea of making people wander all over the dungeon though to get<br/>
the widgets.  Just implement John&#39;s idea so that whenever a special widget<br/>
mob died it got randomly assigned to spawn in place of some other mob the<br/>
next time it was due to spawn.  People would be running all over and yelling<br/>
&quot;Hey I see WaxOnius, has anyone seen WaxOffius?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think NWN is scheduled for 4th quarter release.  Even if they finished<br/>
early they couldn&#39;t put it out before 3rd edition D&D which will debut at<br/>
GenCon, Sylly you lucky devil!<br/>

Yea thats what its called! (forgot the name).  <br/>
<br/>
Ok so make the widgets lore so you can&#39;t really farm them (guess you<br/>
could get one for everyone in your group).  If you really want to be<br/>
cruel, make them no-camp...  I am opposed to forcing certain classes on<br/>
parties so I&#39;d make locked doors with extra prizes or put keys on mobs. <br/>
(who would then be needed if you dont have a rogue, but you could skip<br/>
them if you had one)<br/>
<br/>
NeverWinterNights (II?) looks great, but its more than a year away...  I<br/>
think its release will be the end of my EQ subscription...<br/>

&gt; Gold Box Construction set?  Is that the old Unlimited Adventures?  I had<br/>
&gt; similar &#39;modules&#39; using that and plan to continue the process on the new<br/>
&gt; Neverwinter Nights when it comes out end of the year.  An interactive<br/>
&gt; Baldur&#39;s gate with 100&#39;s of DM&#39;s out there creating virtual worlds.<br/>
