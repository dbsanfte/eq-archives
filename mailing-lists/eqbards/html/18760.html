<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056072259">Welcome Jacana!<br/>
<br/>
These guys (Rosha, Kenross, Miriana) have mentioned some good guilds on<br/>
Innie.  I think in your original post you mentioned finding a guild that<br/>
suits you - best idea yet!  Last night, I saw a guild named &quot;Miraculous<br/>
Musicians&quot; (sp?) something close and 5 of them put on a &#39;concert&#39; in<br/>
Kelethin.  (Some names were:  Yeza, Ghent, Muffin, Forte - so look for them<br/>
if you want an &quot;all bard&quot; type guild.)<br/>
<br/>
Some things on guilds.  I was in Spirit of the Moon as my first guild.<br/>
Their focus was on role playing and having fun.  I found myself to be<br/>
leveling at a faster pace than most of them in my level range (they had some<br/>
folks above me moving pretty fast but no where I could effectively group<br/>
with them.)  At any rate, after a few weeks of not being able to get guild<br/>
groups at the times and frequency that I play, I had to make a change.  It<br/>
was an extremely hard thing to do and I took the time to personally speak<br/>
with as many of my Moonie brothers and sisters as I could.  I think that<br/>
helped alot.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my new guild &lt;The Pantheon&gt; has some really great folks<br/>
in it and the 3 people who were my regular group for levels 10 thru 35.  So<br/>
I am very happy now.  One key thing is that we are all able to play<br/>
together.  Close enough in level and play every night.  We have about 50-60<br/>
active members and only 6 or so are not &#39;planar&#39; (level 46+).  Most are<br/>
51-52 now and I think a few are 53.  We added folks by grouping with them on<br/>
a regular basis in difficult places (planes, dragons, more planes.)<br/>
<br/>
The key is finding folks you like, who play when and as much as you do and<br/>
do the things you like to do.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and gimme a /tell when you are online.  I play quite a bit and<br/>
some odd hours too &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I think that the Innoruuk guilds with the largest high-level<br/>
presence (which isn&#39;t exactly the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing, but I suspect it&#39;s close enough) are, in no particular order:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; LoD (Legions of Darkness?  never quite sure)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pantheon (Sylly&#39;s?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Storm<br/>
&gt; &gt; Order of the Black Staff (mine and Harmonic&#39;s)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unbidden<br/>
&gt; Blazing Hearts/Avanguardia de Valorian (basically one guild)<br/>
&gt; Ethereal Vortex/Last Alliance (maybe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those are daytime guilds that most of us don&#39;t see very often... EV/LA get<br/>
&gt; included in my book simply because EV used to be up there with the other<br/>
&gt; big guilds, and have been around much longer than OBS, Storm, or Unbidden.<br/>
&gt; But, if you just count number of people, including EV would include a<br/>
&gt; whole new tier of guilds (a la Justifiers, Technique)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; OBS has about 140 not counting twinks.  I think the others are in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ballpark.  LoD is considered the &quot;uber-guild&quot; of the server, for what<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s worth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LoD has 50 active members or so.  We&#39;re actually one of the smaller<br/>
&gt; guilds.  And for what it&#39;s worth, we haven&#39;t considered ourselves the<br/>
&gt; uberguild on the server for quite some time. </span></blockquote></div>
