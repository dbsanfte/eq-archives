<div id="ygrps-yiv-982348625">Steal Strength can be dispelled to, just use your target debuff song<br/>
with yourself targeted. 1 pulse will remove steal strength. It&#39;s nice<br/>
because you can sing it. This song is also extremely useful vs. druids<br/>
or mages. Get rooted or snared, maybe a DoT like creeping crud (little<br/>
dog barking icon), or even Tashani or Malise? all can easily be debuffed<br/>
off yourself. If you need to get rid of it faster you can pumice<br/>
yourself. I use the target debuff because you can use it on both<br/>
yourself and a monster, and the other only works on yourself only (and<br/>
party) and I believe requires the lute to be equipped to function (it<br/>
also strips 2 buffs though).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I do not mean to raise an alarm especially on a song that was never<br/>
&gt; particularly useful.  However I just had been hit with a Steal<br/>
&gt; Strength<br/>
&gt; spell by a SK when passing through South Karana.  I took the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to<br/>
&gt; test one of our more useless songs.. after 10 pulses it never managed<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; remove the spell.  I ask our stronger kin to please test these results<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; make sure the song was not killed again.<br/>
