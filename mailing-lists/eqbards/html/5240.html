 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d suggest upgrading your processor first, then your RAM.<br/>
That will make the biggest difference - I did a motherboard<br/>
swap from an AMD K6/200 64MB to the above and it went from<br/>
barely playable at 640x480 to silky smooth at 1024x768.  What<br/>
brand video card?  If your WinModem does not use the latest<br/>
Lucent chipset (check the manual), you will probably want to<br/>
upgrade that as the older WinModems add 100-300 ms of lag and<br/>
eat up a lot of CPU cycles.<br/>
