<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430926504">Actually if its the quest I&#39;m thinking of we tried to abort it on E&#39;ci on<br/>
purpose!  If the so called daughter of Innouruk were wandering thru your<br/>
lands and you were good wouldn&#39;t you try to kill her?  Well we did, but<br/>
unfortuantely there were two many dark elf cleric pc&#39;s about and she lived.<br/>

:( Not happy about their solutions.  I also heard that over the weekend<br/>
they held an aborted quest on Bristlebane. Aborted because someone killed<br/>
&quot;the important NPC&quot;.  I mean, how stupid does Verant have to be to not<br/>
concieve that some player will try to kill their NPC &quot;just because&quot;????<br/>
