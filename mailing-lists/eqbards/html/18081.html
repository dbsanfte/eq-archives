<div id="ygrps-yiv-829339065">&quot;Under no circumstances would I remain in a guild that treated me in such a <br/>
manner.  If I was present to help kill the critter that dropped an item I <br/>
could use, I would expect to be included in the lottery if I didnt already <br/>
have the item, or one better.<br/>
<br/>
This treatment of bards is ridiculous, and I believe that this type of <br/>
thinking needs to be quashed now before it spreads to other guilds and <br/>
servers.  Its bad enough we often get the back-hand treatment from Verant, <br/>
but should we allow our guilds/friends to treat us in the same manner?<br/>

Looks like you just gave yourself the answer ;o)  Actions speak MUCH louder than words, pack your stuff and find a better guild.  Although my guild doesn&#39;t have very many maxxed characters (or ones big enough to join in on dragon raids), I feel pretty safe in saying (especially since I&#39;m one of the higher ossifers in it ;o)~  ) that anyone that participated on a dragon run with us (whether a guild member or a guest), that could use the item, would be included in the raffle.  As you stated, if you helped kill it (and can use it on that character), then there is no reason whatsoever that you should be excluded.  Period.<br/>
