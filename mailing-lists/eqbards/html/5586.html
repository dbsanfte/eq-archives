 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been doing Unrest since 15th, off and on - yard trash is blue, and a<br/>
good party of mixed-to-20th will really help your exp.  However, be<br/>
prepared to run a lot, and don&#39;t let some Shaman or Druid talk you into<br/>
depending on SoW.  In fact, inform your group that you will likely be<br/>
toasting their SoW in the event of a &quot;ZONE!&quot; call.  And you will run.  A<br/>
lot.  But if you have a good cohesive group that will run when told to run<br/>
(why don&#39;t people understand that?!) you will survive a lot longer and do<br/>
much better.<br/>

I had my best &quot;I&#39;m not dead yet!&quot; story out in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron the last<br/>
time I went there.<br/>
I was helping do a corpse retrieval in the Cauldron.  The corpse belonged<br/>
to an 11th level guy who was still in Greater Faydark, and not yet a member<br/>
of the party (which at this point consisted just of me and a 20th +<br/>
paladin). We Selo&#39;d to the young ranger, brought him back to Dagnor&#39;s and<br/>
told him to stay in the NPC camp.  He followed us, a tidal lord attacked<br/>
us, the Paladin had to LoH on himself to survive it, finally the Ranger<br/>
learned to stay at the NPC camp. Finally, I located the body, and<br/>
triangulated it to being somewhere in the water.  Pretty well out there,<br/>
too. We swam out to it and I started arguing with the group leader to just<br/>
have the corpse owner consent me so I could drag the corpse out of the<br/>
water (&quot;No, consent me!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not the Bard - I can outrun anything, AND<br/>
I can find the corpse!!!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t care. Consent me&quot; &quot;Fine. Consent you.&quot;),<br/>
when suddenly an undertow skeleton starts hitting on me, guess it thought I<br/>
was cute, in my orange duds.  Not waiting to discuss dinner plans, I<br/>
started running it towards shore (I&#39;m not stupid - fight on solid ground,<br/>
much smarter!)  Silly party leader stays behind with corpse.  THEN a Goblin<br/>
bosun crashes the party, so the party leader&#39;s dealing with the Skeleton<br/>
(which was a heavy blue to me but really green to him - he was at least<br/>
20th) and leaving me to deal with the yellow bosun.  Nice. Real nice.  I<br/>
dropped in no time, but as I dropped, I was singing the Hymn.  O miracle<br/>
working Hymn, how I adore thee...<br/>
For some reason, the Bosun stopped attacking me, backed off, and started<br/>
using my corpse for a target dummy.  It went like this:<br/>
&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>
&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (&quot;I&#39;m not dead yet!&quot;)<br/>
&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 5!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>
&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (&quot;I feel fine!&quot;)<br/>
&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 7!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You are knocked unconcious!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You are bleeding to death!&quot; (Hymn pulses)<br/>
&quot;You regain conciousness!&quot; (I think I&#39;ll go for a walk now...&quot;)<br/>
&quot;A Goblin Bosun hits you for 4!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All the while, I was slowly trying the death crawl to the NPC&#39;s who hang<br/>
out at that little camp there.  I made it, was knocked unconcious in the<br/>
middle of them, and watched as they took out the Bosun for me.<br/>
In the meantime, the Ranger (who had been shouting &quot;Don&#39;t let Talies die!<br/>
Don&#39;t let Talies die!&quot;) got to his corpse (still in the water!) and looted<br/>
what the Paladin hadn&#39;t already taken.  The paladin didn&#39;t even know how to<br/>
/corpse it out of the water, and had taken almost half his health in<br/>
drowning damage while looting!!!  Gah!<br/>
I finally caught on to what was up when the Paladin asked me to Selo&#39;s them<br/>
both to Unrest and heal them before they went in.  I never thought I&#39;d ever<br/>
have a use for the phrase, but I guess it&#39;s in the EQ Glossary for a reason:<br/>
Sugardaddy was babysitting his twinkie.<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
Anyway - at least I (miraculously) escaped death that time.<br/>
(Of course, I died 7 times that night, guess that was to make up for it....)<br/>
