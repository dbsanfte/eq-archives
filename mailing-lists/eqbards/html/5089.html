<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561438658">i created a gnome enchanter with max charisma and bought all my small steel<br/>
at the lowest possible prices in akanon.  i assume the same would be for a<br/>
human enchanter with max charisma in freeport or a high elf enchanter in<br/>
felwithe.<br/>

It is my knowledge that steel plate can only be bought from vendors<br/>
generally (unless someone is upgrading and wishes to sell their old plate,<br/>
right??) I was just wondering what the minimun price would be for medium<br/>
steel plate, and what charisma/faction it takes for that??</div>
