<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075509551">I&#39;d say Charisma does have an effect as a penalty to the target&#39;s resistance<br/>
roll.  Again to draw a Rolemaster comparison (these seem to fit the model a<br/>
lot don&#39;t they?) it seems to last: <br/>
<br/>
		#Pulses = Amount Resistance Roll failed by / X<br/>
<br/>
	Thus it should seem to last longer on creatures with lower<br/>
resistance or lower level, but not always as the random factor can kick in.<br/>
Gives a variable length as can be seen but if a roll of say 95 still fails<br/>
by 40 and X is 10 it would still last 4 pulses on that very green mob.  When<br/>
that 96 comes up (open-ended in Rolemaster for those who don&#39;t know) and a<br/>
second roll of say 50 is added to it for a total of 145 the very green mob<br/>
resists successfully.  This seems to be true but unlike Rolemaster the base<br/>
number needed to resist in EQ, when the target is 7 levels higher than the<br/>
caster, jumps to zero so that the MOB cannot fail to resist a spell from<br/>
someone more than 6 levels below it.<br/>
<br/>
		Don&#39;t have Charm song yet, but does it seem to follow this<br/>
same pattern?  i.e. does it last longer on very green mobs than on blues and<br/>
reds?<br/>

&gt; How long does the effect of the Lament last after you sing it to the mobs?<br/>
&gt; Will I have to do it over again when I take on the next mob?<br/>
<br/>
It lasts several minutes for me.  Others say it only lasts<br/>
about 10 seconds.  Dunno, maybe charisma has something to do<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
I used it to break up the king area in Permafrost solo.  The<br/>
first time I tried it, I&#39;d lamented all the mobs on the floor.  <br/>
I fought an elite guard down to below half health when a<br/>
newly-spawned priest above us started healing it.  I charmed<br/>
the elite and ordered it to attack the priest, only to watch<br/>
in horror as it decided the shortest route to the priest was<br/>
through all the floor mobs.  Of the four remaining floor mobs,<br/>
only the patriarch (who was actually the most recently<br/>
lamented) was activated by the guard&#39;s passage.  The rest were<br/>
still lamented.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the guard, patriarch, and priest were enough to<br/>
do me in.  :-P<br/>
