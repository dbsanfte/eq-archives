The nice thing is, if your group is good, you can cover both the warden for<br/>
gloves/belt and the lord for silver-plated bracers/GhoulsBane (for your<br/>
paladin friends) at the same time.  I got my gloves and bracers while<br/>
helping some friends camp for the GB. =)<br/>

&gt;A friend told me about some pieces of armor that can only be worn by<br/>
&gt;rogues or bards. I believe they were called elf-hide gloves and<br/>
&gt;troll-hide belt. They each raised 2 different stats 5 points each. These<br/>
&gt;2 pieces of armor sound like a must have but I have no idea where to<br/>
&gt;find them. Anyone know?<br/>
&gt;    BTW: I prefer to use fast light weapons over minos...Once we get<br/>
&gt;dual weild it will save lots of stamina using the light weapons also<br/>
&gt;(combine scimitar and combine longsword is what I have my heart set on). </span></blockquote></div>
