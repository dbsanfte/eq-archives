<div id="ygrps-yiv-23988352"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  This isn&#39;t an attack against younger people, however look at the<br/>
&gt;  average age of druids/necros.  Druids/Necros are two of the most<br/>
&gt;  powerful solo&#39;ing classes in the game (the powerleveler&#39;s dream<br/>
&gt;  if you will).  It&#39;s only fitting that those immature very young<br/>
&gt;  powergaming types, a stereotype of both classes mind you, would<br/>
&gt;  whine much like a child who just had his lollipop taken from him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>:( The druid community has changed, at some point. My original<br/>
character is a druid (I deliberately did not choose bard because<br/>
my friend, Windsong, was a bard and I _always_ fail when it comes<br/>
down to competitions between the two of us so I have learned just<br/>
not to compete.) And I can remember a time when I was proud to be<br/>
a druid. We were helpful, and generally considered a good group to<br/>
run across on the servers. The Druid&#39;s Grove rarely had a complainer<br/>
in it and, rather, was people helping each other.<br/>
<br/>
Now, everything as turned backwards. I&#39;ve even heard that druids aren&#39;t<br/>
welcome in groups because the general idea is that they have solo&#39;d their<br/>
way through the levels, etc. (That doesn&#39;t effect me. I only play<br/>
my druid when my friend is around and I always play with her same-<br/>
level monk. Then we see what else we can gather. But a lot of time<br/>
its just the two of us.)<br/>
<br/>
It makes me quite sad to see how they have changed. I certainly have not<br/>
changed.<br/>
