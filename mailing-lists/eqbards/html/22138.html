Sounds like you have some nice weapons there.  The spine I am not familiar<br/>
with, the Walking Stick I have and use because I like the effect message:<br/>
&#39;somemob01 glances nervously about&#39; (tashan). The &#39;claw thing&#39; sounds like<br/>
Sainey&#39;s Claw which I also have and use because it adds 10 AC.  Some next<br/>
step bard weaps are: Sionache&#39;s Partisan 9/19 piercing, Symphonic Saber 11<br/>
23 with the effect that lowers you on the hate list.  Jade mace 9 18 is good<br/>
too but maybe a bit harder to get as they are usable by other classes.<br/>
Harmonic Dagger is 10 21 - awesome.  breath of Harmony 10 18 effect: Niv&#39;s<br/>
Preservation - uber.<br/>
<br/>
All of these weps are normally obtain by level 50+ groups in the Kunark<br/>
Dungeons.  The bard only ones tend to get traded off or passed down.  <br/>
