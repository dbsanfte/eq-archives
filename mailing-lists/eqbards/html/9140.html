45, but not a 46.  My guess is it caps out at a 16 level<br/>
delta. That is, a level 35 player grouped with a level 50<br/>
would get exp, but a level 34 would not.  At the low end, a<br/>
level 1 player will not get experience with a level 5 (4 level<br/>
delta).  Everything else in the middle is a gradual scale<br/>
between these two deltas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way JM described it, the fraction of the experience for a<br/>
kill that you get is:<br/>
<br/>
 your total experience<br/>
------------------------<br/>
party&#39;s total experience<br/>
<br/>
So you should get good experience provided you kill things<br/>
that are reasonably difficult for the average level of the<br/>
party.  If you kill stuff blue to the lowest level person,<br/>
it&#39;ll be very slow.<br/>
