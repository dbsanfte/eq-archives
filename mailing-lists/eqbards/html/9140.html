&gt; &#39;awesome&#39;.  He believed that the mobs in Mistmoore gave more experience than<br/>

give much more experience than something 8 levels below you.<br/>

&gt; This time, the highest level person was 34 and I got experience when we<br/>
&gt; killed stuff.  This was the first time I had ever grouped with anyone where<br/>
&gt; the level differential (9 levels between highest to lowest) was that high<br/>
&gt; and I still got experience.  Everything we were fighting conned red to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A level 31 friend reported getting experience grouped with a<br/>
45, but not a 46.  My guess is it caps out at a 16 level<br/>
delta. That is, a level 35 player grouped with a level 50<br/>
would get exp, but a level 34 would not.  At the low end, a<br/>
level 1 player will not get experience with a level 5 (4 level<br/>
delta).  Everything else in the middle is a gradual scale<br/>
between these two deltas.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Given the situation I just described, and over the same amount of time,<br/>
&gt; would the total experience received in both situations come close to being<br/>

&gt; mobs that con red to you equal (or come close to equalling) grouping with<br/>
&gt; equal level characters fighting mobs that con blue to you?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way JM described it, the fraction of the experience for a<br/>
kill that you get is:<br/>
<br/>
 your total experience<br/>
------------------------<br/>
party&#39;s total experience<br/>
<br/>
So you should get good experience provided you kill things<br/>
that are reasonably difficult for the average level of the<br/>
party.  If you kill stuff blue to the lowest level person,<br/>
it&#39;ll be very slow.<br/>
