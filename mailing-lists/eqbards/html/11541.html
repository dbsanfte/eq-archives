<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987782689">I finally got a response from the GM I emailed about my corpse situation.  Seems like, the GM at least - has a consistent policy.  Too bad his Guides aren&#39;t aware of it..<br/>

Dear Dan, <br/>
My appologies for taking so long to get back with you, I have been sick and out of the office most of last week.  Thankfully, it has come to pass, and I am back in good health.  I am not sure why a guide didn&#39;t remove your corpse from the lava.  I will normally ask the player to make a valid attempt at removing the corpse, which it appears that you have, and then pull the corpse from the lava if that attempt fails.  I am sorry that this has happened to you, if your corpse is still in lava, I will remove it.  If you have lost your corpse because of this event, I will replace it.  Please get a hold of me in the game and we will resolve this issue. <br/>
GM Daegarmo</div>
