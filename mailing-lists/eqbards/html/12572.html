<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265880278">Someone offered to sell me one of these yesterday for 250PP. I had just<br/>
bought the rubies for my LB so was broke.  Wasn&#39;t sure if I even wanted it.<br/>
I currently wield a dragoon dirk in my off-hand and a runed bone fork in my<br/>
range slot.  If I got the lariat, would drop the dragoon dirk and keep the<br/>
runed bone fork in the ranged slot.  Opinions: does the stun effect and<br/>
extra AC offset the lower damage rating?  <br/>

&gt; Damage: 3<br/>
&gt; Delay: 20<br/>
&gt; AC: 3 (thought this was kinda weird, but no complaint)<br/>
&gt; Effect: Stun<br/>

&gt; Bought a pair for 300p to save a trip, they&#39;re quite fun to play with,<br/>
&gt; especially in an offbalanced group (tank- or caster-heavy).<br/>
