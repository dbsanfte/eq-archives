<div id="ygrps-yiv-220831420">that&#39;s ridiculous.  I have dual wield at 17th, close to the level it starts<br/>
at I think I&#39;m at 23? in it and it goes off for me 10% of the time.  Not<br/>
that it hits for all of that 10% of the time.  Even a first level monk with<br/>
dual wield at 10 sees it go off more than 1% of then time.<br/>

&gt; I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; and dual wield?  If so even at dmg 2 they&#39;d be the equivalent of 5/25 or<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; which is a combine scimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what level they get the skills, but at that level<br/>
the skill is bound to be so low it&#39;ll only go off like 1% or<br/>
2% of the time, making very little difference in the overall<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon until 13th level<br/>
&gt; and that was a dirk at 25p.  I couldn&#39;t have afforded a combine back then<br/>
&gt; because I was too busy having fun to make money ;)<br/>
<br/>
My highest &quot;trade&quot; skill is begging, at 37.  I play the game<br/>
to have fun too.  I&#39;ve never really tried to make money.  I<br/>
guess my high charisma gave me enough of a boost with selling<br/>
prices that I had 60pp saved up by L12.<br/>
