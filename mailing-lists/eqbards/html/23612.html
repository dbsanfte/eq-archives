&gt;===========<br/>
&gt;Special Announcement for eGroups Users<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear eGroups Member,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you may already know, eGroups merged with Yahoo! in August 2000. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt;now proud to announce the launch of Yahoo! Groups, a new service from Yahoo!<br/>
&gt;using eGroups technology.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What Happened to eGroups?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All the features you know and love about eGroups have carried over and we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;added some new functionality that we hope you&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t worry, all eGroups email and web addresses will continue to work, and<br/>
&gt;all of your group information and membership has been maintained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll soon begin to internationalize Yahoo! Groups. In the interim, you can<br/>
&gt;continue to use the international versions of eGroups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s new on Yahoo! Groups?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yahoo! Groups has lots of new features and even better customization. You<br/>
&gt;can:<br/>
&gt;Chat with other group members using our improved Yahoo! Chat<br/>
&gt;Add a splash of color to your group, or a main page photo, all without<br/>
&gt;knowing HTML<br/>
&gt;See when group members are online and communicate with them in real time<br/>
&gt;using Yahoo! Messenger<br/>
&gt;Reach a larger audience - you will have the entire Yahoo! Network at your<br/>
&gt;doorstep<br/>
&gt;And much, much more to come!<br/>
&gt;The best part -- you don&#39;t have to do anything to convert your group. This<br/>
&gt;has all happened automatically. All you have to do to access the wide array<br/>
&gt;of web functionality is link your current eGroups account with a Yahoo! ID<br/>
&gt;by clicking on the &quot;Convert my eGroups account&quot; link below.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And remember, if you would like to continue using only the email<br/>
&gt;capabilities of the service, you won&#39;t need a Yahoo ID. You will continue to<br/>
&gt;receive and post mail, just like you always have in the past.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For a detailed FAQ on merger topics, please go here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On behalf of everyone here at Yahoo! Groups, thanks for being a member of<br/>
&gt;our service.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Yahoo! Groups team<br/>
