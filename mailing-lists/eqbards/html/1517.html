<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353426816">so the next question would obviously be Why aren&#39;t people selling these<br/>
things?  I would think they would bring a hefty bit o change.  Also if<br/>
anyone knows I have worked my faction with the Guardians of the Vale up to<br/>
kindly, am I getting even close?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the money suggestions.  the snake complaint was a side ref to<br/>
the fact that used  to be anytime someone in Qeynos asked how they could<br/>
make money a bunch of people would shout &#39;kill snakes&#39;<br/>
<br/>
also saw no mention of tailoring getting any tweaking in the new patch.<br/>
Wonder why?  we already have zillions of smiths but who&#39;s ever seen<br/>
reinforced leather, much les studded being auctioned?<br/>

It&#39;s a lore item.  You can only have one in your possession or<br/>
in the bank at a time.  You can drop or trade it (I bought one<br/>
for testing a while back, and found another on the ground with<br/>
a different character - apparently left by someone who didn&#39;t<br/>
know they could be recharged).<br/>
