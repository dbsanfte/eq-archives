<br/>
as far as what is different, it has a MR debuff which makes it easier to<br/>
resist, and useless to us unless what people say is true about it helping<br/>
the charm last longer.  and it&#39;s level cap is 52 instead of the lower cap on<br/>
the first charm song.<br/>

&gt; back off command to reset it&#39;s aggro list. Not only does /pet <br/>
&gt; attack work <br/>
&gt; every time after you do a /pet back off (well it does for <br/>
&gt; me), it will keep <br/>
&gt; your pet from attacking your party members, which I have seen <br/>
&gt; numerous <br/>
