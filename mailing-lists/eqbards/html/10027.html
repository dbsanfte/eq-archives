<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290709241">I too had a strange event happen one very laggy night.  Zoned out of <br/>
Permafrost naked.  Zoned back in to see if I would get my stuff (thought <br/>
what the heck let&#39;s try).  Entering into Permafrost dungeon i was greeted <br/>
with the view of the area around Halas with people falling from the sky.  In <br/>
a cliff was my corpse which i could not loot.  Now for the really surreal <br/>
thing.  Not everybody was seeing the same things.  Most were seeing <br/>
Permafrost as the icy cave it is and someone dragged my corpse to the zone <br/>
border.  I camped and relogged.  Logging back in I was fully clothed.  I <br/>
lost a weapon though.  I did a petition and bug report but got no reply.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Funny anecdote.  A friend of mine was running from a train and<br/>
&gt; &gt;managed to zone.  You know how mobs can still hit you for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;while after you&#39;ve zoned and you come out with fewer hp than<br/>
&gt; &gt;when you hit the zone?  Well, apparently one of the mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt;rooted my friend during this interval.  He came out safe on<br/>
&gt; &gt;the other side, but rooted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was once rooted JUST BEFORE I zoned, but the force of the mob hitting me<br/>
&gt;knocked me through the zone. I came out alive, and still rooted. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, once I was running from a tentacle terror in Najena, and I was almost<br/>
&gt;dead and down to a walk (with a ranger, no speed song *cry*). I was surely<br/>
&gt;going to die. But the tentacle terror hit me with one of his spells that<br/>
&gt;throws you to the other side of the room, and since he was behind me, he<br/>
&gt;blasted me through the zone and gave me a one-way superspeedy ticket to<br/>
&gt;safety.<br/>
