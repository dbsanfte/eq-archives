&gt; Heh heh.  A couple weeks ago I was playing with my enchanter.  <br/>
&gt; We got a tough 4-mob pull, and I (being crowd controller and<br/>
&gt; lowest level in the group) blew about half my mana getting the<br/>
&gt; extras mesmerized, but I did it.  I had about 3 seconds to<br/>
&gt; admire my handiwork when the wizard decided it would be a good<br/>

seems like the people playing wizards are some of the dumbest in the<br/>
game. I guess the cleverer people look at the class and realize there are much<br/>
more interesting  ones to play.<br/>
