<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249865603">I can&#39;t get into the price sites I usually look at today, but the Jade Mace is about 18k, the CSS is about<br/>
24k, so the BoH should be about 30k.  That&#39;s the average of the posted prices, but I would expect the<br/>
actual price, especially of the BoH, to be noticeably lower than that now.  Mostly because it&#39;s Bard-only,<br/>
there just aren&#39;t that many Bards, and it isnt&#39; THAT rare a drop.  The senior Bard in my guild got one<br/>
last weekend for a Lamentation Blade straight up (the guy who was trading it sent tells to every 45+ Bard<br/>
on the server, which wasn&#39;t a very long list, hehe), and I got one this weekend because it dropped for a<br/>
guild group.  The Lamentation is about equivalent to the Jade Mace, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note (Bard joke), I find that the proc on the BoH, although it is supposedly instantaneous,<br/>
actually takes about half of a normal song cycle to work properly.  If I assume that it works instantly<br/>
(as the icon suggests), and press another song key, I get song-locked every time.  It takes some getting<br/>
used to.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have a kind of crummy machine running on a dial-up, so I&#39;m<br/>
singing through lag a lot, and anticipating song pulses rather than waiting for the messages, so maybe the<br/>
rest of you have better luck with it.  We were killing the King in Chardok last night, and I was singing<br/>
songs two full songs ahead of the messages, which shows how bad it gets for me (I was actually able to<br/>
twist three, I&#39;ve played this Bard so much).<br/>
