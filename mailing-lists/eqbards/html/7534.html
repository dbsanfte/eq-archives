I agree with you.  Changing the binding policy will change the fighting<br/>
dynamic.<br/>
Melee/hybrids will get to spend more time adventuring instead of wasting<br/>
time<br/>
running across multiple zones to get their corpse.  As a casual gamer who<br/>
doesn&#39;t get to play that often, this is why I support a change to the<br/>
policy.<br/>
Also, groups will be less likely to break up if their tanks die because they<br/>
now<br/>
don&#39;t have to wait a long time for them to return.    <br/>
<br/>
I think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the bind policy, it<br/>
would be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>
Melee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and reenter the battle.<br/>
What<br/>
if the rules were changed to reflect something like along these lines:<br/>
<br/>
1) Any class can get bound anywhere.  Melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>
Players<br/>
without the bind spell<br/>
2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed them is still alive<br/>
when<br/>
they reappear at their bind point,  that character can no longer do damage<br/>
to<br/>
the mob.  This would not apply if the character was resurrected. <br/>
<br/>
There are probably several different ways this could be worked but I think<br/>
something along these lines would be required as a tradeoff for the change<br/>
to<br/>
the binding policy <br/>
