<b>Subject:</b> high level bard suggestion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714828693">Can&#39;t stop thinking about weak bards at high levels, haunted with the<br/>
premonition of myself sitting in the entrance of some dungeon, periodically<br/>
calling out I need to join a group, no answer, finally logging out after a<br/>
long night without having done a thing.  Had an idea, though, tell me what<br/>
you think.<br/>
<br/>
What bards need is more power at the higher levels.  Perhaps the bards<br/>
should be able to &quot;specialize&quot; in one instrument type (not voice) at a given<br/>
high level, increasing damage / effects / duration of whatever songs falling<br/>
under the bard&#39;s specialty.  Perhaps mana should slowly be drained when<br/>
playing songs with a bard&#39;s specialty instrument, for the songs would be<br/>
much more powerful now. If the mana were to be depleted, then the effects<br/>
would return to non-specialty levels.  Perhaps a few new single<br/>
direct-damage songs would be added, similar in workings to bellow only for<br/>
each instrument type, even things out depending which instrument was chosen.<br/>
Could this help you think?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a 45 level bard who had mastered the Specialty of Stringed<br/>
Instruments.  The bard plays good old Hymn of Restoration in the heat of a<br/>
dangerous battle, but now everyone&#39;s health bars noticeably begin to<br/>
skyrocket.  The bard&#39;s mana quickly becomes depleted, yet giving everyone a<br/>
significant health boost.  Enough to save the day and make bards wanted<br/>
(needed even) again at that level!  Two bards of different specialties would<br/>
certainly add to a group in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would like to see a really high level bard actually not much<br/>
good with weapons anymore, instead relying soley on their instruments.  In<br/>
my mind, a mid-level bard is good with song and weapons and a mish-mash of<br/>
borrowed skills, but when they become greater in power and face greater<br/>
foes, should find the one thing unique about to the class, music, the<br/>
greatest weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.  Maybe I should /feedback this sometime.  I gave up trying to use<br/>
EQVault&#39;s Dev Board.  But I think my suggestion would probably be<br/>
complicated enough to implement it will never happen, and bards don&#39;t<br/>
complain enough like the other classes... so, just a dream.<br/>
