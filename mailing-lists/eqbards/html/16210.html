&gt; &gt;If you look at the formulas I whipped up for the <br/>
&gt; &gt;seven-string lute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two<br/>
&gt; &gt;primary factors in a fight are damage rate, and <br/>
&gt; &gt;survival time (rate of damage taken).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think you&#39;re missing something else, and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something to deal with time to kill and downtime.  For<br/>
&gt; example, two wizards can nuke something to death very<br/>
&gt; quickly but then sit and med up inbetween fights.  A<br/>
&gt; warrior and cleric could tank/heal/med and fight<br/>
&gt; constantly with no downtime but the fights take<br/>
&gt; longer.  In my experience the 2nd group will be much<br/>
&gt; more efficient over time.<br/>

equation, necros become even better.  Their lich line of<br/>
spells convert hp to mana at a ratio approaching 1:1 at level<br/>
49 (c.f. 3:1 for manastones), and their lifetap spells convert<br/>
mana back to hp while damaging the mob.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re also forgetting to account for how the solo&#39;ing<br/>
&gt; is accomplished.  A necro can solo outdoors with fear<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t as clear cut.  But my main point is that being in<br/>
a group cannot make the group *worse* than you are solo<br/>
(stupidity excepted).  Given that necros are great soloing, a<br/>
group with a necro cannot be any worse than the necro is solo.  <br/>
Since necros are regularly able to solo some of the toughest<br/>
mobs in the game (outside of the planes), that means any group<br/>
with a necro will be able to take on the toughest mobs in the<br/>
game.<br/>

&gt; &gt;All I know is that a level 50 necro in the group <br/>
&gt; &gt;allowed us to take the lords room in lower guk easily<br/>
&gt; &gt;and hold the room for hours without so much as a hint<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a challenge.  He left and was replaced by a level <br/>
&gt; &gt;50 wizard and we all died the next lord spawn and 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt;tries later we still couldn&#39;t retake the room...<br/>

&gt; Well that&#39;s a poor example.  Two different players can<br/>

reserve comment on this.  But the boks, guks, and lord all<br/>
have a ton of hp.  It&#39;s very likely the efficiency of necro<br/>
DoTs (along with their insane mana regen rate) compared to<br/>
wizard DDs let the necro do a lot more damage to the mobs per<br/>
fight than the wizard could.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest causes of the caster/melee imbalance in the<br/>
game IMHO is that they made mobs harder by making their<br/>
attacks more powerful.  That change hit melee classes full on,<br/>
while having little impact on the casters (who have many ways<br/>
of avoiding taking damage).  Exactly the opposite of what<br/>
needed to be done.  They should&#39;ve kept mob damage the same<br/>
and increased mob hp.  Then casters wouldn&#39;t be able to kite<br/>
mobs they weren&#39;t supposed to be able to kill solo, simply<br/>
because they&#39;d run out of mana.<br/>
