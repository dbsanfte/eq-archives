&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It is possible to have a group larger than 6 people that still shares<br/>
&gt;experience for a kill.  To do this start with a group of 5.  Then have<br/>
&gt;someone outside the group invite the other non party members to form their<br/>
&gt;own group.  They should hold off on accepting the invite (don&#39;t decline<br/>
&gt;either).  Then invite the person who just did that invite to join the first<br/>
&gt;group.  After he accepts, and is added to the group, the other people he<br/>
&gt;invited should accept his group invitation.  They will now be part of the<br/>
&gt;overall group, but will not appear on the main group&#39;s member list.  They<br/>
&gt;will share xp for the kills and can make (but not hear) group tells.  When a<br/>
&gt;party member above them leaves, they will move up onto the list.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If this actually works, it would be entirely possible to have multiple<br/>
&gt;groups combining into one to participate in Vox and Nagafen raids and get<br/>
&gt;group experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And to keep it on topic, how does one Bard buffing 20 people and providing<br/>
&gt;Clarity to a dozen mana-drained casters sound? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wonder how long it&#39;ll take to be &#39;fixed&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, about as long as it takes for them to realize that the experience is <br/>
still only into sixths.  So each member of a &quot;supergroup&quot; is getting more <br/>
experience than they probably should.<br/>

Did I just say that?<br/>
