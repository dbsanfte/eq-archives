<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820745934">Several of you have the wrong info for the Puguis dagger.<br/>
<br/>
The Puguis Dagger is beyond a doubt: DAM 5 DLY 21.<br/>
<br/>
It is indeed dropped off a lesser blade fiend.  The Blade Fiend spawns in<br/>
the room just inside the porch near the back left side of the House.  I know<br/>
this because, I currently own two of these wonderfull daggers that I got<br/>
myself both times.  Both times the Lesser blade fiend spawned in the same<br/>
spot.  He is a rare spawn.  I got one dagger when I was 20th level (over a<br/>
month ago) and another one just last night :))<br/>
<br/>
I am currenly duel wielding the Dragoon Dirk in my primary hand and the<br/>
Puguis in my off hand.  My second Puguis is in the bank :)<br/>
<br/>
Clearing out the rumors :)<br/>

I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a friendly bard for only<br/>
<br/>
25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its damage ratio is <br/>
just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>
increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?  It <br/>
looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>
ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so any <br/>
help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>
graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>
