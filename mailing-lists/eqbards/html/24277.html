Okay - but none the less - with the exception of Whee (and anyone else who<br/>
has yet to voice up).  We all think that the song is at best marginally<br/>
useful.  Some feel that the damage output is too low - given the 20-30<br/>
minutes it takes to regen the mana.  Many feel that that it would be better<br/>
targeted than AOE; that the 55 spell is nice for those that are 55 - but not<br/>
an factor for those of us between 43 and 55.<br/>

No you are dicussing the lvl 43 song Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge (targeted AE<br/>
DD) not the lvl 18 song Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord (PB AE DoT).<br/>

We&#39;re discussing a LEVEL EIGHTEEN song - and you bring up a level 55?  I&#39;m<br/>
53 by the way.  What percentage of bards are 55+?<br/>
