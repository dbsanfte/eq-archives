&gt;He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt;that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant &quot;makes<br/>
&gt;the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt;&quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any knowledge/comments on these rumors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about the sharkskin drum.<br/>
However, the rumor about Ykeshas not going to drop/becoming warrior only is<br/>
a VERY old rumor. They are still dropping, just like normal, on Test<br/>
Server. If the rumor had any veracity to it, I would expect to have seen<br/>
it already.</div>
