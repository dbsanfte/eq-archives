&gt; The problem is, I keep noticing subtle changes in the game where it appears<br/>
&gt; that our class is actually being NERFED instead of having some of the long<br/>
&gt; standing problems fixed, and this is why I am speaking up.  I have played a<br/>
&gt; Bard solidly for 4 months happily, and I wonder why at level 22 I suddenly<br/>
&gt; miss notes regularly on low level songs I have had for a long time, and I am<br/>
&gt; a &quot;Master&quot; at all my instrument skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently the Bard was too powerful in beta and had to be nerfed somewhat,<br/>
&gt; but it seems to be continuing.  Is this innocent mistakes that get<br/>
&gt; introduced into the code with patches or is this secret nerfing that Verant<br/>
&gt; does not want us bards to know about since we would pitch a major fit if we<br/>
&gt; did know?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a word, yes. They never announce nerfings, unless they can call it an<br/>
enhancement. Since final started, many of our songs have been subtly<br/>
nerfed as has been discussed on this list. Lullaby has been nerfed at<br/>
least once, possibly more than once. It&#39;s possible that the missing<br/>
notes at low level problem is an accidental side effect of the supposed<br/>
fix for missing notes on L40+ songs put in a week or so ago, but you<br/>
will never know for sure. They may have decided that while 40+ songs<br/>
were a bit too hard to start, lower level were too easy. Or possibly<br/>
they just wanted to make it less noticable how difficult 40+ songs were<br/>
to start by getting you used to missing notes at lower levels.<br/>
