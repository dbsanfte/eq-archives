<b>Subject:</b> Re: How do you use the lull song and Star Wars. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093631747">1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area <br/>
     effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step <br/>
     by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group <br/>
     of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
     <br/>
*************************<br/>
The way the lull spell works is that it is not an Area effect.  It is a<br/>
single target spell.  What you do is you select one of the Mob in turn and<br/>
play the song.  You will see a text saying that they are sad.  Do this to<br/>
all of the MOB except for the one you want to fight.  This spell will only<br/>
effect up to 4 MOB.  What I do when I hunt orc&#39;s camp is that I would lull<br/>
the other 3 then I would play my bellow song on the one I did not lull and<br/>
back off out of range of the rest of the MOB and attack that one.  Then<br/>
repeat the step for the other 3.<br/>
<br/>
I hoped this help.<br/>
