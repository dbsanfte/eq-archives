<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616299331">Hmm, I can&#39;t attest to the skill of the current Vox raiders on E&#39;ci since I<br/>
have not been on one yet but it seems to me that from what I observe (and I<br/>
keep my ears open) many of the Vox raids on our server end in wipeouts and<br/>
failures, at least ones that people I know are involved in.  <br/>
 <br/>
Ahh well, how much to white scales sell for on E&#39;ci these days, anyone know?<br/>

I stopped going when I hit 53 :) Or more specifically I began to hate the<br/>
Vox/Naggy raids so much that I stayed up all night and dinged 53 so I<br/>
couldnt go anymore.  Veeshan had a very good leader who led the raids weekly<br/>
for months, when he gave it up (got too high), no one stepped up and the<br/>
band of dragon slayers disbanded.  Now its often a collection of idiots and<br/>
munchkins who gather for the dragon slaying.  Loot is frequently ninjaed and<br/>
the raid often takes up to 5 hours!  I decided I&#39;d either buy a scale or<br/>
wait till my guild can kill Gone...<br/>
