<div id="ygrps-yiv-12979278">I&#39;ll try to take a look tonight if I get time.  I have a 23 bard and I was<br/>
in Crushbone helping the low levels the other day.  I was trying to put<br/>
centurions and Legionaries to sleep.  I didn&#39;t have a lot of problems with<br/>
the cents, but the legos were near impossible for me.  I finally gave up on<br/>
sleeping them at the zone line.<br/>

&gt;This theory came up on the concert hall board.  A bard there<br/>
&gt;claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>
&gt;when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>
&gt;bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>
&gt;the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>
&gt;you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>
&gt;level mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It has a lot of holes, but it warrants checking out.  So if<br/>
&gt;you are L15-25 or so, could you try logging some of your<br/>
&gt;Lullaby episodes?  If I remember, Kitasi is about the right<br/>
&gt;level for Runnyeye, no?  :)  You can pull out the data<br/>
&gt;yourself, or email the logfile to me and I&#39;ll do it.<br/>
