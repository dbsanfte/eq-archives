<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-6595733">I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to be a level 50 bard to be able to give opinions <br/>
of a bard&#39;s usefulness. Each level of a bard should be considered when <br/>
making an evaluation. I remember groups loving my level 10 bard and how <br/>
little downtime the group experienced with Hymn. That&#39;s probably the best <br/>
thing I feel about bards is their ability to reduce downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I agree with Kitasi about bards being totally nerfed to the point <br/>
of ineffectiveness. Verant has stated that the Bard&#39;s mezmerize will never <br/>
be as effective as an enchanters.  As a matter of fact, at level 40 in City <br/>
of Mist, I can really only effectively reduce the number of mobs attacking <br/>
my group by 1 (with charm) and have him attack a mob that is currently <br/>
being engaged by my group. Unlike an enchanter, who would be able to <br/>
effectively mez 2 or 3 of them. It does seem that the higher level up a <br/>
bard goes, the less effective a crowd controller they become.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a lot of fun with my 40 bard. I still am mostly in pickup <br/>
groups (part time bard who only plays at most 3 hours) and those groups all <br/>
love having me. Most don&#39;t realize I can charm and help with crowd control <br/>
(of course they all know about clarity). I did some pulling (lament still <br/>
works nicely), some charming mobs off of our healer, and then battle <br/>
buffing. When there&#39;s not an enchanter around, the tanks all pray for my <br/>
Celerity to speed their attack.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, after I told my enchanter friend about how lousy bard mez is, he <br/>
mentioned that they should at least give bards a way to slow down the mobs <br/>
attack. I laughed and said that we get both target and AOE slow down songs. <br/>
I haven&#39;t sung Largo&#39;s in a long time, due to aggro problems. But I may <br/>
throw that in the mix and see how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you really wanted to play a character that is the best of class <br/>
in what they do, then a bard is not for you. Bards are versatile and can <br/>
help every group they join. I find I have to tell my groups what I&#39;m doing <br/>
for them to give them a better appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I really thank those who posted some of their various &quot;macros&quot; for <br/>
weaving. I&#39;ve found that the one for &quot;Hymn and Clarity&quot; weaving for <br/>
downtime is great. My weary fingers thank you!<br/>

&gt;At 09:57 AM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think the &#39;at some point&#39; means when they are working on EQ2.  It was very<br/>
&gt; &gt;apparent that nothing that is related to bards is even remotely &#39;high<br/>
&gt; &gt;priority&#39;.  Bards are at this point pretty much &#39;one hit wonders&#39;.  If it<br/>
&gt; &gt;were not for manasong the only groups we&#39;d be getting into would be those<br/>
&gt; &gt;with our friends.  Bards have become the most &#39;group oriented&#39; kiting<br/>
&gt; &gt;enabled class imaginable.  Every reason I had for playing a bard in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;beginning has been systematically taken away, other than the role-playing<br/>
&gt; &gt;aspect.  But hey!  my druid can hold a mandolin as well as anybody!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ummm, by this standard you would never be getting into groups since you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have manasong.  but taking a step back and looking at all the classes, outside<br/>
&gt;of clerics and enchanters, what class has an &#39;&#39;in&#39;&#39; to get into a group <br/>
&gt;over all other<br/>
&gt;classes?  none.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Seriously though.  I played a bard because of the tactical flexibility.<br/>
&gt; &gt;There was actually a choice of which songs to use in which circumstances and<br/>
&gt; &gt;at what times.  When was it better to Lullaby, when to Chords?  When was it<br/>
&gt; &gt;better to Anthem, and when Psalm?  Those days have gone by as each and every<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and you really have all those choices still at level 31.  as far as i <br/>
&gt;know, chords,<br/>
&gt;anthem, and psalm, as well as hymn, charm, fear, etc all work just fine.  i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;never had the problems with pixie that other bards complain about.  i was a<br/>
&gt;mezzing machine in solb on beetles and ldc&#39;s at level 50ish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;tactical option is deleted or made unusable.  I never Chain unless alone<br/>
&gt; &gt;snare is now far better and only level 1!  I never Lullaby unless it&#39;s to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you never chain unless alone?  maybe you just don&#39;t understand the flexibility<br/>
&gt;of a bard then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;help some newbie, and even then it&#39;s pretty pathetic.  I&#39;ve given up trying<br/>
&gt; &gt;to Pixie anything, better to just charm it and be &#39;protected&#39; when the spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;goes off.  Verant has successfully taken 90% of the things I loved about<br/>
&gt; &gt;bards and killed them.  All because of some &#39;balance&#39; issue that never<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;90%? heh, nice exaggeration.  i suppose if the ONLY things you liked about<br/>
&gt;a bard was snaring and crowd control this might be true.  i personally <br/>
&gt;like a lot<br/>
&gt;more things about my bard.  just as a side note, what is your cha and do you<br/>
&gt;use a wind instrument when using pixie?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;existed.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rarest classes in a game that&#39;s all about power???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;because our power is nicely masked.  you have to be a good player and <br/>
&gt;understand<br/>
&gt;a lot about our songs and the way the game works and other classes before <br/>
&gt;you can<br/>
&gt;be that superpowerful bard.  most people either don&#39;t stick with it long <br/>
&gt;enough or don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have enough knowledge to really master the bard class.<br/>
