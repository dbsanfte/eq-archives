only bard capapble of using it currently.  37 minutes to be exact I think.<br/>

where do you get the 40 minutes thing?  is that how long it takes to med<br/>
back a full 5 bubbles of mana?  for me dirge only takes 3 bars of mana, so<br/>
that would be only 24 minutes if i medded back to full, sooner if i just<br/>
medded<br/>
back a bubble (altho then i would require the full 40 minutes).<br/>

&gt;My problem with this song is the concept.  If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate<br/>
&gt;Dirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>
&gt;once every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>
&gt;least some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant<br/>
&gt;effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>
&gt;you get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual<br/>
&gt;outcome of any fight, and is<br/>
&gt;actually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which<br/>
&gt;wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>
&gt;coupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed,<br/>
&gt;frequently without damaging them in<br/>
&gt;the slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are<br/>
&gt;laughably small compared to the<br/>
&gt;increased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>
