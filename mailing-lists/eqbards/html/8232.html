<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314657532">Well, having read the responses to my message, I can only say that I <br/>
postulated two possibilities:  1) the song isn&#39;t broken, it just stinks <br/>
or 2) I&#39;m delusional.  I guess we go with number 2 for now!  hehe!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;On eight different occasions, I have had a negative effect<br/>
&gt; &gt;disappear as soon as the song did its first static charge pulse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Purely coincidence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was fighting the SK/Shaman duo in Rathe Mnts the other night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clinging Darkness (dot + snare)<br/>
&gt; Targ-something Insects (drowsy)<br/>
&gt; Root (shaman)<br/>
&gt; Infectous Cloud (shaman disease)<br/>
&gt; Heat Blood (dot)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I purposely had ADM memmorized to clear this garbage, it did<br/>
&gt; nothing but give the static pulse message and put an extra icon<br/>
&gt; on my screen.  With lute in hand, I tried to start the song then<br/>
&gt; attack, and blamo I was Clinging Darkness and Drowsy immediately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I even tested more things too the other night,<br/>
&gt; This song has absolutely zero effects when:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; o played before battle to be pro-active (preventative).<br/>
&gt; o played during battle to cancel said effects.<br/>
&gt; o played after battle for an extended period of time.<br/>
&gt; o played while selecting the enemy who cast on me.<br/>
&gt; o played while selecting no target.<br/>
&gt; o played while selecting me as the target.<br/>
&gt; o played while selecting a group member as target.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I did get a few times where I noticed I was under<br/>
&gt; a bad spell, and then tried to click the ADM and by the<br/>
&gt; time I fumbled the lute into my hands - it disappeared<br/>
&gt; at close to the same time.  Most ill effects are very short<br/>
&gt; lived.  But this song is definitely broken, and I tested<br/>
&gt; it for the entire duration of my camping those guards for<br/>
&gt; 3 or 4 hours under a variety of circumstances.<br/>
