Subject: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I figured out the perfect way to test attack speedups.  Equip<br/>
&gt; a nonmagical weapon, and attack a wisp.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what I got punching a wisp.  Since I wasn&#39;t hurting the<br/>
&gt; target, I could let the fight run much longer than usual.  I<br/>
&gt; also logged it and searched through the logfile afterwards to<br/>
&gt; confirm the number of swings (the other problem I had with<br/>
&gt; long sample times was that I&#39;d miscount the number of swings).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Time   Swings   Delay   %chg Delay   %chg Speed<br/>
&gt; Normal       177.7    50     35.54        -            -<br/>
&gt; Warsong(50)  285.8   100     28.58     -19.58%       24.35%<br/>
&gt; Anthem       162.5    50     32.50      -8.55%        9.35%<br/>
&gt; Celerity     147.8    50     29.56     -16.83%       20.23%<br/>
&gt; Beserk(50)   148.1    49     30.22     -14.96%       17.59%<br/>
&gt; Verses       136.9    50     27.38     -22.96%       29.80%<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; %chg Delay = 100 * [(song_delay / normal_delay) - 1]<br/>
&gt; %chg Speed = 100 * [(normal_delay / song_delay) - 1]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking at this, pretty much everything lines up with the %chg<br/>
&gt; speed being 25% for Warsong at level 50, 10% for Anthem, 20%<br/>
&gt; for Celerity, and 30% for Verses.  Beserkers I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
&gt; changes as you level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The big thing to note here is that the speedup for Verses is<br/>
&gt; *better* than Warsong for soloing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another curiosity is that nearly all the delays have a 0.5<br/>
&gt; second biasing.  You&#39;ll remember I remarked on this in my last<br/>
&gt; set of tests, during which I speculated it was something I was<br/>
&gt; doing.  With a sample this large, I&#39;m confident enough to say<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s probably a feature of the game, and an artifact of the<br/>
&gt; weapon delay system Verant is using.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will test enchanter speedups when I can nab an enchanter to<br/>
&gt; buff me.  Considering I&#39;m giving one of the guild enchanters a<br/>
&gt; tinkerers bag (so he can carry around aqualungs to sell), this<br/>
&gt; should be pretty easy.  :)  I will also try it with various FS<br/>
&gt; and rusty weapons.<br/>
