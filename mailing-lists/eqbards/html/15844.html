<b>Subject:</b> More weaving spiders <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547045284">Okay, so last night I decided that pressing my nose against the screen<br/>
reading the messages while trying to weave four songs wasn&#39;t stressful<br/>
enough (with the first two being DoTs there should always be some DoT effect<br/>
while you are getting benefit from the other two) I decided to try using the<br/>
instruments for each. My setup:<br/>
<br/>
lute hanging on the cursor.<br/>
<br/>

| drum |  | horn   |<br/>

| DDD | |  CoD  |<br/>
----------  ----------<br/>
<br/>
----------    ----------<br/>
| Largo |  | PRyth |<br/>

and here is what I did:<br/>
<br/>
(horn) DDD<br/>
(swap horn/lute) CoP<br/>
Largos M. Binding(swap horn/drum)<br/>
(swap Drum/Lute) Purifying Rhythms(swap Lute/Horn)<br/>
(swap drum/horn)<br/>
<br/>
Yeesh, but it worked great, gotta love having 68 poison resist when fighting<br/>
crag spiders. I never had to run, although people kept running by and<br/>
buffing me so I never got an exact idea of how it worked over time. And this<br/>
is on a Pentium 233 with a 56K connection, yes there were gaps between the<br/>
songs, but once I found the groove they were less frequent and pretty small.<br/>

Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>
(btw, the last name means &quot;Of The Undead Forest&quot; in Elvish for Kithicor,<br/>
where Tszaaz was born. Running through Kithicor last night I was laughing<br/>
about all the time I spent there looking really hard for some hidden,<br/>
unknown story/danger I could tie into Tszaaz&#39;s backstory. Sheesh, running<br/>
the zone edge is filled with unknown danger these days).</div>
