<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928677944">Nope I agree with you totally.  I disagreed with Harm in that most of the<br/>
hits from lower level mobs are not within the 80% of max area.  However, if<br/>
you take out just the hits for 1, suddenly the remaining hits are again<br/>
mostly within that 80% of max window.  That makes me think there is either a<br/>
bug in the damage calculation, or, that when you eliminate damage due to<br/>
damage avoidance as opposed to absorption you take a minimum of 1 no matter<br/>
how much you would have absorbed over the amount done.  For example all hits<br/>
are avoided with damage avoidance do 1.  All other hits do their full damage<br/>
minus X.  Since their full damage is actually a much higher range in general<br/>
than your absorption, you only see a lot of high number hits, but as<br/>
avoidance goes up, you see many more hits for 1.<br/>

&gt; Wow I disagree with Harm??? Unheard of almost.  Actually you might as well<br/>
<br/>
I assume you meant you disagree with me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; be right though.  From the parsings I&#39;ve done a mob will. regardless of<br/>
&gt; level, hit you for 80% of its max or more 80% or so of the time it hits<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; for more than 1.  As you go up in levels you should see more misses and<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; hits for 1, at least thats what my logs have shown so far.  The amount of<br/>
&gt; hits I see between 1 and 80% of max hasn&#39;t changed much for most mobs<br/>
&gt; despite gaining 12 levels since I started checking.<br/>
<br/>
Which supports what I wrote.  As I&#39;ve increased in level, the<br/>
average damage I take from a hit has gone down.  If I&#39;d meant<br/>
median or mode, I would&#39;ve said so.  :P<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>
&gt; &gt; appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>
&gt; &gt; per hit. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Giants have and will always hit for ~96 dmg.  Your level makes<br/>
&gt;   little difference in the amount of the attack.  Yes, they miss<br/>
&gt;   you a lot more often, but a L42 ice giant&#39;s consistant hit is 116,<br/>
&gt;   it was 116 when I was L14, and it still is 116 at L50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Regardless of level the monster will strike usually in the upper<br/>
&gt;   80% of their damage range unless they outright miss you.<br/>
