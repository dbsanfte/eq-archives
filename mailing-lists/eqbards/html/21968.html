<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-413047081">This problem has existed as long as I;ve known about the assist command.  I<br/>
have no idea why they have never bothered to fix it, as it can cause some<br/>
pretty big problems.  Mash the assist key a few times, and you will settle<br/>
on the right mob soon.</div>
