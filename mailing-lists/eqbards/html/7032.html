<div id="ygrps-yiv-281564749"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    I fear that this may be the case for binding by NPC&#39;s.  When JM posted<br/>
&gt;he pointed out that the binding issue was a huge philosophical/design<br/>
&gt;argument by the designers at Verant (we don&#39;t know how accurate his sources<br/>
&gt;are - but it rang true)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As to the philosophical issue, they can scrap it. Taking an hour to bind at<br/>
prime time (remember, just because others can bind doesnt mean they will) is<br/>
a hassle. Many times I have entered a off the track town (Halas, RV,<br/>
Kaladim) and been the only one there. Makes adventuring unfun knowing if you<br/>
die its a long walk. I am not saying that any class other than the actual<br/>
caster classes should get the bind spell, but being able to be bound by one<br/>
of those classes anywhere would not disrupt the balance too much if they<br/>
made it equal to all classes by implementing the same thing as after being<br/>
resurrected. You respawn at half hps, mana, stat hits, etc. It would skirt<br/>
around the issue of exploiting by binding in a lair somewhere, and having<br/>
the melee classes constantly charging to die again. (though most forget that<br/>
while caster classes dont necessarily need thier equip, melee classes and<br/>
hybrids are equip dependant and dont function effectively without it)<br/>
On the real subject of the NPCs casting bind, I don&#39;t see how it would be<br/>
that big of a deal. NPCs are around that will cast healing or cures for<br/>
either a donation or an item, the casting of the bind can be set up to do<br/>
the same thing. Easiest to do would be set it up on the priest of discord.<br/>
Theres one in every city, so it could easily be accomplished (at least in my<br/>
mind, if they can set npcs up to cast the heal spell, should be able to<br/>
effectively cut and past - crude terminology I know - the code onto another<br/>
npc with the bind spell replacing the heal spell.)<br/>
As for bards getting the bind spell, it would be nice, but a pipe dream I<br/>
think. With my bard I bind at the bank, grab my spare drum (I keep a few<br/>
extra) and zip back to corpse in no time. Giving the bard bind opens the<br/>
doorway to other classes binding (rangers use druid spells and druids get<br/>
binf, pals use cleric spells which can bind, etc) and that is an issue<br/>
Verant doesnt want to touch. Gate potions though have been introduced into<br/>
the game, so a bind potion as well seems feasible. Make it city only like<br/>
the spell. If you try to get the melee class bound outside the city it<br/>
fails. I would only assume the potion (procing the same spell) would have<br/>
those same guidelines.<br/>
