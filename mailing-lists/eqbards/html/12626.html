<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course, this was Camii on the E&#39;ci server, I would assume<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s the same idiot person.  Camii is the lead GM on Innoruuk <br/>
  now.  It&#39;s all going downhill from here people.  However, there<br/>
  is a killer GM on Innoruuk whose name escapes me, or rather will<br/>
  remain confidential because I don&#39;t want to see this guy get booted<br/>
  like our last head GM did.  The good people always are forced to<br/>
  leave.  Anyway, this guy rolls up into PoF and is making me laugh<br/>
  like every 5 mins.  Saying crap like, hey Soandso isn&#39;t about time<br/>
  you eat another DT.  The guy was nutz, he was very friendly and<br/>
  really could fit in with the players though.  Shoulda asked him to<br/>
  pull Cazic for us, heh.  He seemed kinda new to the scene however.<br/>
