Not necessarily so.  When Fallout was being developed, Interplay was<br/>
initially using the GURPS RPG system as their base stat/skill system.  But<br/>
fairly late into the development process, they lost the GURPS license and<br/>
had to create their own stats/skill system from scratch.  Now I don&#39;t know<br/>
how long this delayed release, but I don&#39;t think it was very long.  The<br/>
developers of DAoC can work on areas such as graphics, AI, client/server<br/>
interface, etc. while they develop a new stat/skill system.<br/>

Nope, count DAoC out.  Since ICE just folded, they&#39;ve lost the rights to <br/>
the role-playing game engine they were using as a core for the <br/>
game.  Contrary to statements to the otherwise, there is no way that they <br/>
can develop a new engine that is stable and decent in time to meet their <br/>
schedule.  There WILL be delays.<br/>

P.S. Shadowbane does look good in terms of gameplay - but the graphics look <br/>
pretty bad still.<br/>

&gt;I followed a link off Lum&#39;s site to Dark Age of Camelot. I think they are<br/>
&gt;starting closed Beta 2 with release scheduled for next summer. It sounded<br/>
&gt;like a great game IF they can keep the system from being abused. I did read<br/>
&gt;something this week about them having to do some redesign of the rules due<br/>
&gt;to Iron Crown (?) folding. All this is off the top of my head though so<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t take it as gospel. Go check out the FAQ.<br/>
