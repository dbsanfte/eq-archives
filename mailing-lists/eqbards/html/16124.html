<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866347059">A couple of friends and I were in Steamfont killing Mino Lords the other <br/>
night, trying to get me out of 31 so they could bask in the glow of my mana <br/>
song, when the strangest thing happened.<br/>
<br/>
I was with a level 36 Barbarian Shaman (with her pet) who was soloing, and I <br/>
was grouped with a level 30 Druid.<br/>
<br/>
We figured that I would get exp faster if I grouped with the druid instead <br/>
of the Shaman.  So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill one.  <br/>
While she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier on <br/>
her while we awaited our turn.<br/>
<br/>
One time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of Fulfil&#39;s <br/>
Curtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along with a <br/>
small DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>
<br/>
So when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for the <br/>
kill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it, had <br/>
her pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe, and <br/>
yet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even <br/>
equipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>
<br/>
So, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>
<br/>
1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>
2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>
3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>
4.  It&#39;s a bug<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
