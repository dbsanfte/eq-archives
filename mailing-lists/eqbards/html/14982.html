<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542923856">Well I was thinking (yeah it gets me in trouble sometimes and here were a<br/>
couple of ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Melf&#39;s Magic Magnifier<br/>
Instrument: Wind (+100%)<br/>
Effect: -20 resist all aoe and -20 resist all group debuff - unresistable<br/>
Comment: Yes a magic magnifier! It reduces resists for everyone in your<br/>
group and all monsters in the area causing fewer resists and greater damage<br/>
for all casters, npcs and pcs.  Useful in lots of situations and allows<br/>
bards to do something other than mana song when grouped with mostly casters<br/>
Problems: May be over powering.. -40 sv all with no chance of resist would<br/>
be quite powerful and possibly lead to bard suicide squads in the plane and<br/>
dragon raids.  Of course in the plane raids every bard is in a suicide<br/>
squad ;) (Innorok says, &quot;CELANDRO!!!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Alternate Effect: -1 sv all permanent effect aoe<br/>
Comment: Essentially a permanent effect, selfstacking song.. Not as<br/>
powerful as it might sound, in a minute song would give -12 sv all Of<br/>
course if a battle somehow lasted 10 minutes it would be -120 sv all so if<br/>
you could keep it mezzed for 10 minutes it would have no resists left Or 10<br/>
bards singing at the same time would do that in a minute. Come to think of<br/>
it might want to put a 2 minute time limit on it or cap the total resist<br/>
debuff the song can give at say 60 (same as shamans malosi)<br/>
<br/>
