<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756963940">There are agility bonuses that differ when you hit certain points.  I had a<br/>
100 agility and an AC of around 200 or so when I got my first agility<br/>
boosting item.  Going from 100 to 102 with no attached AC bumped my AC up by<br/>
9 points.  Not sure if there are bonuses at points past 101, but I would<br/>
imagine they get spread out at that point.  I checked with a new character<br/>
and 101 is definitely better than 100 and 110 is no different from 101.<br/>
Could not add enough points to reach 111 so could not check that, will try<br/>
with a halfling rogue to see if bonuses really do continue past 101, and<br/>
will report back on Monday.<br/>

&gt; Agility is great for all classes. Most importantly agility directly<br/>
effects<br/>
&gt; your armor class which allows you to get hit for less damage and fewer<br/>
&gt; times. Agility should always be priorited in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
People keep saying this but I don&#39;t find it to be true. I tried tonight<br/>
with my serpentine bracer. AC 1 AGI 9. I put it on and my AC went up 1.<br/>
It does affect how often you get missed but has _no_ effect on AC, which<br/>
is how much damage you take when you do get hit. As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>
significant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>
