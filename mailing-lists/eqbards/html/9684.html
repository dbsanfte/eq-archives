&gt;Good point, it would quite amusing seeing Troll and Ogre &quot;Musicians&quot; (not<br/>
&gt;bards).<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t see why Verant don&#39;t have evil bard types, musicians in battles<br/>
&gt;were used to raise troops moral and get a good marching beat, are Verant<br/>
&gt;saying that Trolls/Ogres don&#39;t go into war?<br/>

&gt;I still maintain that we bards were never meant to get imbrued armor for<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;simple fact imbrued means &quot;stained&quot;, as in soaked and stained - I pictured<br/>
&gt;it as going to SKs, maybe rogues, whereas lambent means shimmering or<br/>
&gt;radiant, far more appropriate for us goodie-two-shoes bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This brings up another minor rant I have... where are the evil bards?<br/>
&gt;Surely the bad guys have singers of villainy and strife.  The lizard men<br/>
&gt;would be a great concession on that, given we already have their scout<br/>
&gt;fifes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just by way of humor, can you imagine a troll bard?  Even better: a troll<br/>
&gt;bard doing the happy dance? :)<br/>
