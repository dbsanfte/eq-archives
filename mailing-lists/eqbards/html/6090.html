&gt; The other night a crazy Barbarian friend of mine suggests we try working on<br/>
&gt; our hand-to-hand skills against the reavers.  Sure, I say, let me learn<br/>
&gt; a few appropriate songs (Chords, etc) and I&#39;ll equip the Lute.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm...I wonder how much a barbarian warrior can punch for at high levels<br/>
with a maxed hand to hand. 10? 20?  I *think* I punched for 6 once, but I&#39;m<br/>
not sure...average seems to be 2 to 4, with lots of misses.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that the<br/>
&gt; Lute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>
&gt; take down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my hand-<br/>
&gt; to-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, another thing to consider is the delay on hands is kinda slow, compared<br/>
to a dirk or longsword. (30 delay is what I&#39;ve heard before.)  So, less punches=<br/>
less chances to hit=less chances for skill to increase.  And yes, I believe it<br/>
does<br/>
go raise slower the lower the skill is.  I used to punch a lot back in the<br/>
teens/20s,<br/>
and the skill would hardly move - I was never able to maxed it.  Recently, at<br/>
level<br/>
30, I&#39;ve been using the lute in Cazic to lullaby some monster huge pulls, and<br/>
while punching away (for 2 to 4 damage at a time, grr) my skill shot up 10<br/>
points or so, way faster than it had before.<br/>

&gt; with just songs...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, lullaby just gets better and better...I hadn&#39;t used it for a few levels,<br/>
because it was such a hassle finding a spot where I wouldn&#39;t sleep people<br/>
in other groups. (On Rallos Zek)  But lately, with Cazic having 10-15 people<br/>
on average, I&#39;ve pulled it out again, and have been rather amazed how well it<br/>
works. 5+ lizzies, almost no resists, very few of them waking up early...its<br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Lull has proven useful lately too.  Nice trick: Invis up, sneak past what you plan<br/>
<br/>
to pull, lull the stuff thats within agro radius that you don&#39;t want to fight yet,<br/>
then<br/>
have your puller pull the mob.  This way, with almost no risk, you have 3 fewer<br/>
mobs incoming...<br/>
