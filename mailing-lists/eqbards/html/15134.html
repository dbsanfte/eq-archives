&gt; YES!<br/>
&gt; Like me? :)<br/>
&gt; In some places, the surrounding is as dark for my wood elf druid and<br/>
&gt; my half elf bard as for my Erudite enchanter. Night vision does NOT<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Usually there&#39;s not much you can do with a laptop.  On most<br/>
video cards though, you can tweak the gamma under the hardware<br/>
options.  Also, in your hardware configuration, if your<br/>
monitor model is one that Windows recognizes, I believe it<br/>
also does gamma correction.  Since you&#39;re playing a 3D game on<br/>
a laptop, I assume it&#39;s a Dell Inspiron 7500?  Right-click on<br/>
the desktop, select properties, then settings.  I could&#39;ve<br/>
sworn there was a gamma slider on the one I saw.<br/>
<br/>
PCs are notoriously bad about gamma and have never had a<br/>
standard.  Macs and SGIs OTOH have always been gamma<br/>
calibrated.  One of the reasons they&#39;re still the preferred<br/>
platform for professional graphics and video work.<br/>
