<div id="ygrps-yiv-975085968">Personally, i think that the actions taken (debuffing to prevent a malicious<br/>
KS) were justified, and appropriate. However, i do feel the need to point out<br/>
that you need to be careful about using a Pumice stone against another player. <br/>
This action does fall under the clause in the rules about circumventing the PVP<br/>
rules to cause harm to another player (much like casting sow on a bard !!) and<br/>
is therefore a bannable offense.<br/>
<br/>

What does everyone think about all the changes from monday&#39;s patch that were<br/>
reversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist : )], Hero Bracer<br/>
etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD BE warrior only,<br/>
but they should have made it so instantly when they discovered the error.<br/>
<br/>
one last thing....Allakhazam&#39;s reported the Hero Bracer (I believe someone on<br/>
the list (Minkin?) called it a Mino Bracer) to be a quest item....does anyone<br/>
have any idea what quest that is?  i am not necessarily looking for a complete<br/>
description, but if anyone knows the starting point, please let me know (maybe<br/>
i can help you find something you&#39;re looking for in return : ) )<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to e-mail directly to me.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
