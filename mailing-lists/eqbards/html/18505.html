<div id="ygrps-yiv-778424838">Yeah, we have the same thing on Sol Ro, with Paradigm and The Twelve Moons.<br/>
Both are fairly exclusive allowing only a small number of guests on hunts<br/>
and not really abiding by others who might try to call a dragon or plane<br/>
hunt. The bashing they receive is amazing though, and on a whole,<br/>
undeserved; especially The Twelve Moons, which is a predominately German<br/>
guild.  They get a few too many anti-German comments for my taste (focusing<br/>
on their nationality not the way they play the game).  <br/>
<br/>
Those in the guilds attribute it to jealousy but more realistically, I think<br/>
its frustration.  The successful large guilds are highly organized, and<br/>
where it might take a rag-tag group (or smaller guild) 4 hours to prepare<br/>
for and kill something, these guys can walk in and do it in an hour (or<br/>
less).  I don&#39;t think its because they are better players at all, but<br/>
because they have a few people who possess leadership, motivation and<br/>
organization.  And its frustration, not jealousy that causes bitter comments<br/>
when a group of 3 guilds has been clearing Fear for 12 hours only to have a<br/>
larger/more experienced/uber/whatever guild waltz into a plane and steal the<br/>
kill.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll stop now before I insult someone :-)<br/>

		we get the same thing on our server, as i am sure every<br/>
&quot;uber-guild&quot; (stupid<br/>
		term) does on their respective servers.  i don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone is quite as<br/>
		large or has quite the attitude that FoH apparently does<br/>
though.  i think<br/>
		they have 300 or so members, so they can really take over a<br/>
large portion of<br/>
		the high level game from other players.  we have about 65<br/>
members or so, and<br/>
		we can do dragons and planes at our leisure as well, but we<br/>
work very well<br/>
		with the other guilds on the server capable of doing these.<br/>
i don&#39;t believe<br/>
		that is the case with FoH.  i have no first-hand experience<br/>
but from what i<br/>
		hear they deserve their rep, but i guess only those who have<br/>
dealt with them<br/>
		personally can know.<br/>
<br/>
		ok bragging time, we killed Venril Sathir first =b<br/>
