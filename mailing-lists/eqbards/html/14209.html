<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434424519">With DE illusion up and the Carillon song, I can get my faction to the ogre<br/>
merchants up to Amiable.  Does sneaking with the Carillon get it to Warmly?  If<br/>
not then the illusion is better than sneaking when selling.<br/>

&gt; lot lately, and if you sneak behind them and buy/sell your prices are a lot<br/>
&gt; better than as a DE, although sneaking is less convenient.  . </span></blockquote></div>
