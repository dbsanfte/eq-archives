&gt; The purpose of the /loc command is to help in fixing software bugs, not as<br/>
&gt; a game tool.  You can indeed use it to help you in some ways in the game,<br/>
&gt; but my personal opinion is that to do so is to play the computer rather<br/>
&gt; than the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	You are right, this is a personal choice. For I am more Chaotic Good and<br/>
feel that computer bugs and debugging tools are just undocumented features.<br/>
Cheating is just playing by the advanced rules. For sometimes one may have<br/>
to break one rule to fix/prevent a greater wrong.<br/>
<br/>
	Alas this world requires us to contemplate things that we wish we did not<br/>
have to, but rules of no value if they cause greater harm than the situation<br/>
they where intended to fix.<br/>

	PS - I have finally returned home, An I&#39;m on a system with a real keyboard<br/>
and a working spellchecker! I hate laptops as well as using them on the<br/>
road. So I would like to thank all for enduring the constant stream of typos<br/>
and misspellings that plagued my messages. They where the product of<br/>
laziness mostly and I am glad you did not make an issue of it as some<br/>
mailing lists tend to do. For I am an old IRC/MUD used and believe two<br/>
things:<br/>
	A.) When in doubt, phonically spell it out.<br/>
	B.) Fluent typo spoken here (Se Halba es Typo).</div>
