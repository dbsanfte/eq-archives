Your next climbing mission, should you choose to accept it, is the top of<br/>
Kaladim.  The base of the statue is easy if you get lev cast on you and run<br/>
around to the left-side wall facing Kaladim.  But, if you&#39;ve got a fast<br/>
enough PC & good enough connection, you can make it to the dwarf&#39;s nose if<br/>
you run from the uppermost ledge of the rock-thingy closest the statue.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t done it myself, but then I haven&#39;t been to that continent since<br/>
getting a fast enough PC.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, anyone with more geological knowledge than me know what those<br/>
tall rock thingies in Butcherblock are called?<br/>

WOW!  Very nice climb.  Gives me something to strive for.  So far, I&#39;ve<br/>
been up the wizard spires, and the RV bank, but than I&#39;m only 13th, so have<br/>
a little while before I can attempt that one.  Nice to know I&#39;m not the<br/>
only dare devil bard around.  Everyone thinks I&#39;m nuts, but hey, it&#39;s a<br/>
great view up there. *smiles*<br/>

  Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the statue<br/>
of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be climbed :).<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard, but it may be<br/>
possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for screenshots and a<br/>
description of how I did it.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
