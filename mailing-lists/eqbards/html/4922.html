<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446632747">Duel a human sometime.  No one is ever fooled they aren&#39;t fighting the<br/>
computer.  Really, MOB tactics are very limited, move to target, get weak,<br/>
move away.  Cast from distance or use bow from distance.  Fairly simplistic,<br/>
especially when fighting many at once.  Monsters will use spells to heal<br/>
each other, give you that, but they really don&#39;t use the spells they have<br/>
that intelligently... thus they are given unlimited mana.  It almost seems<br/>
MOBs cast what spells they are given at random, to me.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the AI in the current crop of FPS games these days.  EQ may not be<br/>
Unreal by any means, yet admit EQ&#39;s AI behaves about like Doom&#39;s did.<br/>

&gt;I have to disagree with you on the AI.  The AI is much better than any game<br/>
&gt;that I have played.  Yes there are places where you can trap NPC&#39;s and kill </span></blockquote></div>
