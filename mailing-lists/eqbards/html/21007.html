<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157925826">OK, I actually tried to get someone in-game to help me with my math but all <br/>
those that could have helped were busy killing things... hehe<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh, 32 years old and a complete math dunce; which is why I usually leave <br/>
the in-depth analysis to people like John Kim(TM)...  =8^)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, additionally, seeing that minotaur horns were much better for wind songs <br/>
than my Unicorn Horn (which seem to be wrong now.. hehe) I cruised through <br/>
Beholder to pick one up.  Of course I decided to be really really stupid and <br/>
invised myself into Runnyeye where I proceded to get killed by severy WAY <br/>
green gobbies and evil eyes.  Of course I lost my newly-gained level 41 and <br/>
half a bub of hell exp... OUCH!  All rez-capable clerics were all deep <br/>
within nasty Kunark dungeons, heading to them, or camped deep in some horrid <br/>
spot (like outside Naggy&#39;s door) in preparation for an upcoming raid.  So, I <br/>
ended up camping and I&#39;ll give it another go tonight; I think I have another <br/>
hour and a half left before I&#39;m un-rezzable.<br/>

&gt;15 MR redux is actually 15% better than 13 MR redux, not 5%.  Sounds like<br/>
&gt;they are equivalent to the mino horns.  Maybe you just typoed and meant 15%<br/>
&gt;anyhow ;-)<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Unicorn horn and wind bonus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the goofy subject of my original message; I forgot to change it..<br/>
&gt;hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, as some of you may have noticed, I had discovered what I had thought<br/>
&gt;to be a bonus that the Unicorn Horn has to wind-based songs.  Yeah, I know,<br/>
&gt;wind songs don&#39;t do much with bonuses (can you levitate 20% better?), but<br/>
&gt;there are a few cases where it does make a difference (ie. Pixie Strike&#39;s <br/>
&gt;MR<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;debuff, possibly others).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, after careful testing of my Unicorn Horn and a standard store-bought<br/>
&gt;flute, I have determined that the Unicorn Horn does add an addition 5% to<br/>
&gt;wind-based songs where it can actually make a difference.  Standing in the<br/>
&gt;Freeport bank, I pixie striked myself several times with a store-bought<br/>
&gt;flute and my MR was reduced by 12 points.   Then I pixie striked myself <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the Unicorn horn and my MR was reduced by 15 points.  I believe my starting<br/>
&gt;MR was 48 at the time (I had removed some of my MR gear so that I could hit<br/>
&gt;myself more reliably).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/em envisions hordes of bards scouring Lesser Faydark for Equestrielle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, maybe not.  Minotaur horns supposedly have a 15% bonus and they&#39;re much<br/>
&gt;easier to find and kill than a very tough 40+ semi-rare mob.  But then it<br/>
&gt;has that fabulous light source capability and a whopping 4 charges of<br/>
&gt;Purge...  =8^)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On another note, while meeting up with my wizzie friend in NK last night, <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;discovered 5, yes FIVE HG&#39;s roaming around which we quickly charmed and<br/>
&gt;nuked with one load of mana...   Of course the richest one had a whopping<br/>
&gt;2pp on him... =8^P<br/>
