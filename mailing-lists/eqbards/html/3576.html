&gt; Actually even though I am a woodsy, I never went into Crushbone until<br/>
&gt; after I had been to such exotic places as BB and Paw, well exotic for one<br/>
&gt; born on Faydwyr.  But lord knows I was quivering every minute the first<br/>
&gt; time in Paw since I knew it was a 45 minute run back from Qeynos as there<br/>
&gt; was no one in Arena to bind me and our groups only 12th level caster was a<br/>
&gt; cleric, thus no bind yet.  I&#39;m irritated by the bind thing because I<br/>
&gt; travel a lot and don&#39;t have the patience to sit at a bandit camp for more<br/>
&gt; than about half an hour.  I can think of no level after 7th where I gained<br/>
&gt; all my xp on one continent, much less one zone.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, in the case of BB and CB I personally don&#39;t think that being able to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bind is what causes those zones to be bursting at the seams.  The zones <br/>
&gt; themselves are VERY close to major cities and very easy to get to.  CB is <br/>
&gt; extremely simple to run to from Kelethin in a minute or less and the major<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hassle getting from Qeynos to BB is waiting to zone into the from North <br/>
&gt; Qeynos into the Hills...but even that trip takes maybe 3 minutes or so<br/>
&gt; tops. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other than this reason I can&#39;t imagine what the allure of BB is for so<br/>
&gt; many <br/>
&gt; people for so long, and even I am not guilty.  I spent levels 5-8 in BB <br/>
&gt; before I decided to brave the cross country trip from my starting city of <br/>
&gt; Qeynos and other than hunting lions in the Karanas for pelts to make <br/>
&gt; patchwork armor, BB is just about all I did, Gnoll after Gnoll, day after <br/>
&gt; day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what is the best loot in BB?  A +3STR spiked collar that you can only <br/>
&gt; get off the elites, which you can&#39;t really kill until you are in your<br/>
&gt; teens? <br/>
&gt; Hmm, or is it the +2AGI onyx earring?  I dunno, unless I am mistaken that <br/>
&gt; dungeon doesn&#39;t even have any lore items.  Strange...but many many people <br/>
&gt; from the west side of Antonica grow up in BB just like players who start<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; Faydwer grow up in CB.  They are places where one can remain challenged<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; many levels. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do think that BB could have its own terrorizing D&#39;Vinn type character,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; one of the things about that place is the size and frequency of the<br/>
&gt; trains. <br/>
&gt; Do all dungeons have huge trains on a regular basis like this?  I have<br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; annihilated by trains in Runnyeye, Guk, CB, and BB - the only dungeon I<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; not seen a big train in so far is Unrest. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I don&#39;t particularly want my bard to be able to bind - <br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mind <br/>
&gt; &gt; finding or waiting for a caster - my problem is WHERE <br/>
&gt; &gt; noncasters can be bound. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As someone pointed out earlier - it tends to make folks much <br/>
&gt; &gt; less likely to <br/>
&gt; &gt; explore the world - course he was happy bout that - only 10 <br/>
&gt; &gt; folks in his <br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeon whereas places like BB and CB are bursting at the seams. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you really want folks to get out an explore, you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; penalize them <br/>
&gt; &gt; with half hour - hour - sometimes longer &#39;downtime&#39;, just to <br/>
&gt; &gt; get back to <br/>
&gt; &gt; their corpse. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It was decided early on that all casting classes (not <br/>
&gt; &gt; hybrids) would have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; As a matter of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fact, some of you early phase testers might recall that Bind <br/>
&gt; &gt; used to require <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a then hard to find and costly stone to cast. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;After a lot of heated debate, the spell was given to all <br/>
&gt; &gt; pure casters, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;after more heated debate the cost of the spell became mana <br/>
&gt; &gt; only.  You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;want to know how ugly it got when the idea of the casters <br/>
&gt; &gt; being able to self <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bind anywhere besides in an adventure zone came up. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;So, I wouldn&#39;t ever expect any of the hybrid classes to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; able to bind.  It <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is not going to happen, it&#39;s something of a concession that <br/>
&gt; &gt; bind even works <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the way it does now.  The idea of inns or static NPC&#39;s that <br/>
&gt; &gt; could bind was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;kicked around back in beta, and rejected. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is akin to the exp loss reductions that have twice <br/>
&gt; &gt; occurred, once in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Beta, and once again in Final.  Both times, there was a very <br/>
&gt; &gt; strong negative <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;reaction from many members of the development team, a schism <br/>
&gt; &gt; if you will. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;But in the name of  the holy grail of &quot;playability&quot;, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; experience loss <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;reductions were implemented.   This was partially offset by <br/>
&gt; &gt; the increased <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;experience needed for levels after 25th implemented a few <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks earlier (but <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;much too late imho, the damage was done) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;In the case of experience loss, the changes were made to <br/>
&gt; &gt; help out the game&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;actual market.  The mass market, RPG newcomer.   The game is <br/>
&gt; &gt; complex by <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;design, lightly documented by design, and often daunting, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and far too many <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;folks bypass the built in training curve via various <br/>
&gt; &gt; methods, leaving them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills <br/>
&gt; &gt; (and character <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;skills). <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was <br/>
&gt; &gt; necessary all of a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty <br/>
&gt; &gt; discouraging, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.  And <br/>
&gt; &gt; there are the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;inevitable bugs and zone crashes that were fairly common <br/>
&gt; &gt; early in retail and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;still persist.  After a bit of this, people start to  vote <br/>
&gt; &gt; with their feet. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And since the bulk of the player base fell into this <br/>
&gt; &gt; category in one way or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;another, from a business standpoint it was suicidal to stand <br/>
&gt; &gt; by design <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;principles in this case. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;With the success of EQ, I&#39;m hoping the existing player base <br/>
&gt; &gt; will in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;future be educated enough about RPGs in general, and Verant quirks in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;specific, so that when EQ2 rolls out, the bar can be raised <br/>
&gt; &gt; in terms of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;experience and rate of progression/regression.  Hitting the <br/>
&gt; &gt; level cap in 45 <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter <br/>
&gt; &gt; how dedicated a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind <br/>
&gt; &gt; capable players <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;online on any server at any time to accommodate player <br/>
&gt; &gt; needs.  The only time <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;this is not the case is when a fresh server comes online, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and the race to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;12th or 14th level is on, and those few casters that reach <br/>
&gt; &gt; it first are <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;heavily in demand..but only for a matter of days or even hours. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Now, you ask, why did I compare the experience loss changes <br/>
&gt; &gt; to giving Bind <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Affinity to everyone, either by spell or by NPC&#39;s?  Well, <br/>
&gt; &gt; both rank right up <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;there as the most requested changes to the game.  One <br/>
&gt; &gt; happened, one won&#39;t. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a <br/>
&gt; &gt; fee, and limit <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; advantage that the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;class/es <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a <br/>
&gt; &gt; city, which is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nice limit for the NPC&#39;s. Make sense to me if you want to <br/>
&gt; &gt; foster a sense <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;being able to explore the world safely. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., <br/>
&gt; &gt; mebbe you could <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suggest this idea: <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast <br/>
&gt; &gt; a &quot;bind&quot; spell <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; ask the cost for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it <br/>
&gt; &gt; cost, say 1 plat, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; players could still undercut the merchants, but other <br/>
&gt; &gt; players wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together <br/>
&gt; &gt; to get bound in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are <br/>
&gt; &gt; inconvenient at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow <br/>
&gt; &gt; travelers to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;feel <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; safer traveling. <br/>
