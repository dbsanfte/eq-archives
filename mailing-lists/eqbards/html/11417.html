<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990856417">I have probably solo&#39;ed a full half a bubble (I hate solo&#39;ing) of all my XP<br/>
gained to level 30.  In that time, I&#39;ve almost always had fantastic and<br/>
informed parties.  Even the parties where people have other characters that<br/>
are HIGH (over 40th) level bards have never been a problem.  The average<br/>
maturity level of the player on Prexus is higher, they are just better<br/>
informed, OR I&#39;ve just been EXTREMELY lucky for 30 levels.  No one has ever<br/>
questioned me when I say that I don&#39;t get a song that helps mana regen until<br/>
level 32.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe also it is my approach.  If I join a party where I haven&#39;t played with<br/>
the people before, I immediately announce my song line up and the role that<br/>
I will play in different situations (weaving MR, tanking, buffing, pulling,<br/>
lullaby, emergency chain, etc.).  Occasionally someone might have a<br/>
suggestion such as please don&#39;t charm because it messes up my nuking, or<br/>
don&#39;t lullaby because I mez, but for the most part I&#39;ve already taken those<br/>
things into consideration before announcing my song lineup.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
been treated as an equal and never left out of the buffing or looting and no<br/>
one seems to miss a heal on me.<br/>
<br/>
A couple times, I&#39;ve partied with another bard but usually they let me call<br/>
the shots for what songs each of us should be playing (you weave MR and I&#39;ll<br/>
pixie for example).  When we do find ourselves weaving the same songs, we<br/>
quickly come to an arrangement of roles.  So far in my experience, there are<br/>
always more ways for a bard to contribute then there are bards in the party.<br/>
<br/>
I did get scolded once though:<br/>
&quot;What happened to the Solesek Champion?  WTF?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ooops, hit the charm hot key instead of anthem.  Sorry&quot;<br/>
&quot;Take that off your hot key now please&quot;<br/>
&quot;No prob, already gone 8)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A side note:  I usually always ask that any bard (including myself) only<br/>
weave 2 MR songs when doing MR.  Missing a note and dropping one of the MR<br/>
songs can be to devistating to risk that possibility.<br/>

&gt; Beside my bard I play about 2-3 other characters ranging from<br/>
&gt; levels 5 to15<br/>
&gt; and I find myself in many groups where I end up playing &quot;backseat bard&quot; to<br/>
&gt; the bard already in the group. Usually this starts when the bard<br/>
&gt; in question<br/>
&gt; is not twisting anything, or better yet when they are playing Jig in order<br/>
&gt; to help out the casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course not everyone appreciates this at times so I just remain<br/>
&gt; quiet and<br/>
&gt; just let the bad karma roll on, thinking to myself, &quot;well next time they<br/>
&gt; fire up chords when we get mobbed, the &quot;beat me silly&quot; sign is going to be<br/>
&gt; hanging off their back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sigh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Put that up there with: (at early 20&#39;s)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Play the mana Song&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Then the bard launches into a long explanation that the &quot;Mana<br/>
&gt; Song&quot; comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 32 and why Jig of Vigor doesn&#39;t really increase mana and why it seems<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; increase mana)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, but play the mana song&quot;....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My advise (probably obvious but worth stating) is to join a<br/>
&gt; guild - where<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can explain these things to people who hopefully will be intelligent<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to understand what we&#39;re doing...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Back to the Jig topic - it&#39;s amazing how many people still<br/>
&gt; insist that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; speeds mana.  I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with<br/>
&gt; me - that he<br/>
&gt; &gt; tested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the<br/>
&gt; casters to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; full mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; used up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked<br/>
&gt; the Bard why<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; was doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>
&gt; &gt; words - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>
&gt; &gt; obviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Back to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win<br/>
&gt; situation - if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have<br/>
&gt; looked like sour<br/>
&gt; &gt; grapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you<br/>
&gt; wanted to!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Was in a full group tonight with 2 clerics, shaman, paladin and an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; additional bard doing MM yard trash.  Two clerics.  A shaman.<br/>
&gt;  LOH.  How<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could I die?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Foolish, yes I know.<br/>
