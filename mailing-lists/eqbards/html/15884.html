 </span></blockquote>One word - HERMIE (the hermit in South Karana). You can find him at loc<br/>
neg5465 neg2718 (approx). He&#39;s inside the house within the brick wall<br/>
surrounding it. You won&#39;t be able to get inside the house to kill him but<br/>
DDD, CoD (any ae song) will pull him out. Or, you can sit by the fireplace<br/>
and say, &quot;I will kill you&quot; and he&#39;ll come out after you. I preferred to pull<br/>
him out with the song and back way off so he can&#39;t hit you thru the wall. He<br/>
does cast, but if you are weaving DDD, CoD with hymn, it should be no<br/>
problem. Soon he pops out and hits ya and you just keep on singing. The only<br/>
thing about him, though, is he is such good exp that he is camped a LOT.<br/>
But, keeping that in mind, you can hunt the whole zone while you wait for<br/>
hermie to get free. Actually, South Karana is a great place for experience -<br/>
you can hunt aviaks, and if you get in a good group experience is great<br/>
there as well. Oh yeah, hermie is great exp from your level (you said 22?)<br/>
until you hit 28.<br/>
