<div id="ygrps-yiv-897534965">Use bellow without making an attempt to melee the monster at all, and only once<br/>
the person fighting it has it around half life. Also stand aways away. It is<br/>
generally very clear you are assisting without trying to steal it. Also<br/>
remember that all people see is &quot;[monster] reels in pain.&quot; so like most of our<br/>
songs, they have very little idea what we are doing. I also use consonant chain<br/>
to help others in the same manner.<br/>

&gt; Something neat about shamans (and I assume clerics, druids<br/>
&gt; and enchanters) is the ability to commit random acts of kindness.<br/>
&gt; Walk up to a fight, looks close?  Cast a heal or two, and a<br/>
&gt; couple of buffs, walk on.  I&#39;ve yet to find a way to do this well<br/>
&gt; with my bard.  The only way to do it is to directly affect the<br/>
&gt; mob, and that seems rude to me without an invitation, even if<br/>
&gt; there is no chance of kill stealing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone got any tips for this sort of activity as a bard? </span></blockquote></div>
