 </span></blockquote>No, and I very much doubt it ever will.  Sure it&#39;d be convenient, a nice<br/>
timesaver, but as is I just look for someone I know in a particular zone<br/>
and ask them how many people are in it.  Being able to list all the people<br/>
in a zone you&#39;re not in takes away from the anonymity function, and gives<br/>
a further sense of omnipotence to the player.<br/>

But then I suppose wish lists are just that. -.-<br/>
