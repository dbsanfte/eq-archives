the long way through dead side would require both invis to undead and<br/>
eventually invis.<br/>

prefer a flute.  There is no quantitative data to support using one over<br/>
having an extra 10cha, but if it is anything like the lute&#39;s effect on<br/>
hymn, it is (the instrument) definitely the tool of choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No charisma earrings to be had from enchanters, gotta hit Unrest for those<br/>
(Undead Barkeep for those interested, 5cha 2ac).  A pair of those, gold<br/>
star ruby rings, guise of the deceiver, plat cat&#39;s eye necklace (9cha),<br/>
and a suit of lambent make up my current gear that gives charisma,<br/>
boosting base to like 136 or so.<br/>

A note on pixie strike: I have experienced it&#39;s brokenness, where the<br/>
message of glazed eyes is given yet the mob continues attacking.  However,<br/>
the vast (vast) majority of the time, it does work for me how it is<br/>
supposed to (unless resisted).  I have held reds cold in lower guk, and<br/>
count strike as one of my favorite songs.  A few nights ago, a 50 druid,<br/>
44 necro and myself (36 bard) went down to camp the frenzied by ourselves<br/>
(I kinda forced my way into the group).  As we were getting ready to<br/>
assault the room, a wanderer walked up behind us.  Immediately we were<br/>
swarmed by 4 frogs we had invis&#39;d our way passed.  I thought the druid was<br/>
going to evac, and since I didn&#39;t have screech mem&#39;d (getting sooo hard to<br/>
decide what to keep on tap), I started striking the mobs that were hitting<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
The necro&#39;s pet probably got one of them close to dead before dying itself<br/>
fairly early on in the fight.  The two casters focussed on starfiring and<br/>
draining one frog at a time, while I struck those yet untouched.  All the<br/>
frogs were red, and I was able to keep two down with very little damage<br/>
being taken.  When one frog remained standing, I kept it glazed over till<br/>
the duo had enough mana to finish it off.<br/>
<br/>
I love being a bard.<br/>
