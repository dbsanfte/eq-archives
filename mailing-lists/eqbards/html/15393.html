<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549229429">If I had to guess, I would also think that the mob&#39;s level relative to the<br/>
player was a factor as well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something on the order of...<br/>
<br/>
 ( Exp Penalty + (Player level - Mob Level) ) * Constant<br/>
<br/>
Thus if a mob is higher level than you, you lose less exp, and if a mob is<br/>
lower level than you you lose more exp. Also, based on the exp needed to<br/>
level formula I would doubt that the death penalty formula is linear. In all<br/>
likely hood, there is an exponential factor inviolved somewhere.<br/>

&gt; It is much more likely that there is an exp penalty for dying formula that<br/>
&gt; is similar to the exp needed to level formula. If I had to guess, the<br/>
death<br/>
&gt; loss penalty probably has a constant that increases as well. Perhaps the<br/>
&gt; constant for deaths increases one level after the constant for leveling.<br/>
&gt; Theoretically ( I have not run any actual tests ) this would account for<br/>
&gt; greater exp loss after the hell level than during.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ex. During hell levels you lose {X exp * Constant} the following level you<br/>
&gt; lose {X exp * (Constant +1) } Therefore your loss of exp after a hell<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; is greater than during the hell level.<br/>
<br/>
This would explain my L31 death costing more experience than<br/>
my L30 death.  It does not explain my L47 death costing *less*<br/>
than my L46 death should have.<br/>
