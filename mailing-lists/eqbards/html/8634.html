&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t mean to sound condescending, but I don&#39;t believe you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didnt post this to impress you or anyone else. Personally I don&#39;t care <br/>
whether you or anyone else believes me. I was stating that it is possible to <br/>
kill hg&#39;s solo at my level.<br/>
<br/>
And yes I am talking about charming. Heres how i did the 4 hg&#39;s. I would <br/>
charm one HG, the other 3 would stop to beat on that one since it now has my <br/>
faction. Then i would charm  a different after that one broke. The same with <br/>
the 3rd and 4th. Then I would take the strongest, charm it, and have it <br/>
attack the weakest. In this way I killed 4 HG&#39;s in a pretty short time. As <br/>
for the charm, very rarely l&#39;ll get maybe 6 or so resists in a row, but then <br/>
when one does stick, it lasts for a solid 10 seconds at least. Sometimes it <br/>
sticks and breaks right away but not too often. <br/>
If you still dont believe me, make a character on MM and meet me in rathe <br/>
mountains.<br/>
