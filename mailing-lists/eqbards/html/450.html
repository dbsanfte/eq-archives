&gt; Hey can some high level bard help me out?  Where is the place where they<br/>
&gt; sell songs in Highhold?  namely the level 16 song...  and where do we buy<br/>
&gt; a song in Erudin?  am I (half-elf) even allowed in Erudin? Just wondering<br/>
&gt; for future knowledge...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go into Highpass Hold.  Avoid dying (not an easy feat).  Find the keep with<br/>
the guards outside.  Go inside.  You will zone into another zone called<br/>
Highpass Keep.  The song vendor is inside somewhere (I won&#39;t tell you exactly<br/>
where, so as not to spoil your fun).  Many people don&#39;t know there is a whole<br/>
other zone in Highpass.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful inside the keep to.  Guards do not kill any prisoners who may be<br/>
intent on killing you.<br/>
