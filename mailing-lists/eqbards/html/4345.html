<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705705615">What time of day do you play? (And what time zone are you in?) I find that<br/>
the game is vastly different at different time of the r/l day.  The peak<br/>
hours for number of players seems to be US evening hours.  Not necessarily<br/>
the quality time.  Try all different hours of the day.  Other option is a<br/>
combine dagger or a crookstinger.  A dirk is good - my first choice but not<br/>
for 75pp - you can get 2 combine daggers for that and have change for milk<br/>
and muffins!<br/>

		I&#39;ve been searching (on Veeshan) for one of these for 3<br/>
weeks now in various<br/>
		zones and continents. The *only* time someone was selling<br/>
one and replied to<br/>
		me was for 75pp. I&#39;m sorry, but magical or not - I&#39;m not<br/>
paying 75pp for a<br/>
		friggin&#39; dagger - at least not that particular dagger.<br/>
