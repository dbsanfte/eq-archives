<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503817072">I&#39;m 30th as I&#39;m pretty sure I stated many times, just not in my recent<br/>
replies perhaps.  I am grouped with a ranger 90% of the time as they and a<br/>
monk are our guild&#39;s only tanks. (our warrior recently quit EQ sadly)<br/>
<br/>
Attack speedup songs are pointless as the &#39;chanter Alacrity&#39;s all the tanks<br/>
and that&#39;s better than any speedups I have.<br/>
<br/>
Chains is useless unless I want to break the ranger&#39;s snares.  Or the other<br/>
ranger&#39;s, or the druid&#39;s, or the other druid&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to the same problem really.  A bard is an awesome way to<br/>
make up for the lack of having a particular type of caster in your group<br/>
whatever that missing type might be.  If you have all the major types<br/>
covered though, we look like lousy psuedo-tanks with some interesting<br/>
secondary abilities.  <br/>
<br/>
It goes back to my previous bard complaint from way back, being a third rate<br/>
everything does not necessarily balance out with being best at something.<br/>
If there was a better balance between casters and melee classes in EQ we<br/>
would instantly become more useful as any given group would be more likely<br/>
to be missing some type they needed.<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time you entered a zone to see shouts of &quot;Bard wanted for<br/>
group&quot;?<br/>
I&#39;d answer never.  Every time I play I see &quot;Cleric needed for group&quot;, or<br/>
&quot;Enchanter needed for group&quot;, or &quot;2 Tanks needed for group&quot;.  I may not get<br/>
refused by groups but the first question is always &quot;Do you have manasong?&quot;<br/>
(I play Anon)  The response is always &quot;Oh.  Darn&quot;.  If Lullaby worked even<br/>
marginally I&#39;d start ansewring those &quot;enchanter wanted&quot; shouts and see if<br/>
they were really &quot;Clarity wanted&quot;.<br/>
