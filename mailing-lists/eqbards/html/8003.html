<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572857111">I&#39;d describe the range of screech as &quot;very small&quot;, but it seems to vary I&#39;ve<br/>
found.  I can be hitting cyclopses with melee and they can be hitting me, and<br/>
they&#39;re somehow outside the range of the song.  But with giants, they seem to be<br/>
affected from outside melee range.<br/>
<br/>
The range is less than lullaby or chords of dissonance though, certainly.<br/>

&gt; Just what is the range of a Screech?  I just got it and was testing it on<br/>
&gt; goblins in Misty and Beholder, and it seems to me that it only works on<br/>
&gt; stuff very close to immediate melee range.  It seemed to be a very<br/>
&gt; small area.  Is this true?  Or does it take awhile to kick in?  Or does<br/>
&gt; range increase with level?  I did enjoy watching four goblins drop<br/>
&gt; everything and flee in terror.  Hehe.<br/>
