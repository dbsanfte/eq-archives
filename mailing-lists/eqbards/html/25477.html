<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160414779">if rathe mountains isnt busy, you can try charm kiting giants (if its not<br/>
busy). You can make good cash here, the plat gets heavy but you can buy<br/>
rubies for 131 and resell em later for 119 each, instead of running to bank<br/>
all the time. When I did that for a level or 2, i came out of rathe<br/>
mountains with 2 stacks of 20 rubies. Just a thought... Or you can try<br/>
Dreadlands kiting is good there too, I found that way back then the birds<br/>
were not too shabby xp, and the monkeys, dogs werent worth it...<br/>

Ok, I&#39;ve been 40 for about a month now, and have 2 bubbles to go.  I&#39;m sick<br/>
of being 40!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sick of pickup groups!  Heh.  So, any advice would be welcome on<br/>
where to go at this level, and what song combination to use to solo me 2<br/>
bubbles as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using chains-fulfils-tuyens, but it takes so long to kill a frost<br/>
giant this way...I get bored quickly (hence, 40 for a month...hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
