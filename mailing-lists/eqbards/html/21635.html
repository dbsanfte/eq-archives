<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Planes time for ELfson! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-820968749">Woohoo!  I broke out of 45 last night (man that level stunk).  I am well<br/>
into my death buffer (got 2 bubs in an empty SolB last night due to lag, we<br/>
held all three King, Priest and Champ rooms), so I am raring up for planes.<br/>
<br/>
A few questions:  How do you get invited to go on Planes?  I only know like<br/>
3 people who go to them regularly, and my guild is still at least a month<br/>
away from being capable of doing it on our own.<br/>
<br/>
Any sites have a goodplanes guide I could read?<br/>
<br/>
What songs seem to be the songs of choice there?</div>
