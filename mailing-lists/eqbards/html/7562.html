<div id="ygrps-yiv-441984978">I might have bought that if bards were listed as Rogues/little bit of<br/>
everything.  We are so far behind rangers/paladins/shadowknights in actual<br/>
melee capability that relating us to them is something I find extremely<br/>
difficult to swallow.  My 17th levl bard could never keep up melee damage<br/>
wise with our ranger, much less the paladin.  rangers get dodge and dual<br/>
wield and double attack and parry?  Paladins get bash and double attack and<br/>
parry.  We get dodge, capped lower than them, and dual wield.  Hardly seems<br/>
equivalent to me.<br/>

&gt;To put it in the simplest terms, you have 2 (yes, only 2) &quot;pure&quot; classes<br/>
&gt;that everything else comes from:  Casters and Melee&#39;rs.  Everything else is<br/>
&gt;a hybrid of the two.<br/>
&gt;(At least the way I see it)<br/>
&gt;So therefore, any class that doesn&#39;t just melle or doesn&#39;t just cast is a<br/>
&gt;hybrid.<br/>
&gt;:o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No there are three:<br/>
Melee classes: These are the professions that us no magic, they rely on <br/>
muscle to do the job.<br/>
Priest Classes: There power is drawn from there diety.<br/>
Magic User Classes: There power is derived from arcane knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Hybrids are a combo of any two of these three archetypes.<br/>
In EQ the break out this way-<br/>
Melee:<br/>
Warrior<br/>
Monk<br/>
Rogue<br/>
<br/>
Priest:<br/>
Cleric<br/>
Druid<br/>
Shamen<br/>
<br/>
Magic User:<br/>
Wizard<br/>
Enchanter<br/>
Magician<br/>
Necromancer (personally I feel the necro class is more of an evil priest but<br/>
<br/>
that is besides the point).<br/>
<br/>
Hybrids:<br/>
Ranger (Warrior/Druid)<br/>
Paladin (Warrior/Cleric)<br/>
Shadow Knight (Warrior/Necromancer)<br/>
Bard (Warrior/and a little of everything else)<br/>
