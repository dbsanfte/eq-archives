&gt; &gt; When you get a bit higher _as a bard_ you&#39;re going to discover the joys<br/>
&gt; &gt; of being on a mob&#39;s hate list before you even play a song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was a theory going around the enchanter&#39;s board that<br/>
&gt; high charisma also contributes to mob hatred.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I (Bard 27) went to Permafrost on Sunday with a group of roughly 30 level <br/>
20-50 players.  Our intention was to invade as far as the room just <br/>
prior to Lady Vox, and practice on the Ice Giants and Priests.  As one of <br/>
the youngest, I was put in the &quot;baby&quot; group, whose job was to mop up the <br/>
various level 25-30 goblins spawning on the upper ledge.<br/>
<br/>
My group had just finished off some goblins, taking some damage, so I was <br/>
singing healing at the point when the main group pulled two Ice Giants by <br/>
accident.  One of them immediately charged past the entire massed group <br/>
of level 30+ players in order to whack on me.  Since trying to escape <br/>
would have meant certain death, I ran back and forth hoping that he would <br/>
 get dumped off on someone else, which luckily happened.<br/>
<br/>
He had stunned me, so I was no longer singing, but I was fortunately only <br/>
down to half health, so I went in a corner and stood there quietly <br/>
watching the battle.  Very quietly.  At this point, some higher level <br/>
player managed to trigger a third Ice Giant.  What did that Giant do?  He <br/>
charged past the entire assembled mass of 30+ players, just like the <br/>
first one, and who did he whack on?  ME.  I cannot believe that my <br/>
unadjusted charisma was so much higher than ANY of the other players that <br/>
this caused the Giant to get ticked at me.  This is just the life of a <br/>
Bard.  Hehe.<br/>
