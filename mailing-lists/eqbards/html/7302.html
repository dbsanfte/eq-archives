<div id="ygrps-yiv-442263112">Yes and Accelerando also &quot;broke&quot; SOW - which made a bard singing it in a<br/>
group with people SOW&#39;d very unhappy.  So Verant decided to &quot;fix&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
This was changed about two patches ago.  At the time - we (on this board)<br/>
were under the impression that Accelerando would now NEVER break root.<br/>
Recently there were reports that it on several occasions it did break root.<br/>
We are trying to figure out what the heck is going on...<br/>

&gt; Uhhh, no<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It absolutely, positively did break root at one time - god knows I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; fetched my share of pullers out of unrest after a ghoul got ahold of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) The Root duration is pretty random anyway - perhaps the people when<br/>
&gt; &gt;people thought they &quot;broke&quot; it - it simply wore off at the same time.<br/>
