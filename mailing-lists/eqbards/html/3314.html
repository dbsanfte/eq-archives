<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598260575">It does make a difference.  I started a bard with 111 agi, 131 with Feet<br/>
like a cat :), and I find I dodge more, and get hit for less, but must wear<br/>
lighter armor.  I also started a gnome cleric with an agility of 101 and 100<br/>
to test the difference and your ac base goes up at 101, but not at 100 or<br/>
102.  With an agility of 101 my gnome cleric could solo pawns at level 2<br/>
with only a 6 in his 1 handed blunt, because they would rarely hit me, and<br/>
with patchwork would often hit me for 1pt.  I had trouble soloing pawns at<br/>
3rd with the first cleric attempt at 85 agility and 81 strength, because<br/>
they would beat the heck out of me long before my increased damage mattered.<br/>
It would seem there is a definite tradeoff in agi vs str and Kitasi has<br/>
little trouble soloing blues, unless they are the easy to hit have a lot of<br/>
hp variety.  I can even solo some whites and have soloed a yellow recently<br/>
at 15th.  I get swung at a lot, but don&#39;t get hit too often.  When I do it<br/>
often hurts as my armor is light.  I usually position myself on one side of<br/>
our targets while the other 3 party members assault from the front.  Usually<br/>
about halfway thru a fight they will all turn on me and the whole party gets<br/>
to swing at their backs.  Its amazing to watch how quickly we slaughter<br/>
critters once they turn their backs on a pallie, a ranger, and the cleric.<br/>
All to hit that irritating bard.<br/>

Alas, from my rogue friend&#39;s enthusiasm about agility I had hopes that it<br/>
actually meant something.  I fear strength, indeed, is the only statistic,<br/>
and the others have little or no impact.  One would hope that if someone<br/>
actually concentrated on another statistic besides strength they would reap<br/>
some reward.  Well, one can only hope that at least for rogues, high agility<br/>
helps as she believes.  (Hey, monks have their own physics, why not others?)<br/>
