<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574232376">our melee skills pre kunark were much better than druids or shamen based on<br/>
our selection of weapons. post kunark, with the discovery of some brutal 2h<br/>
blunt items, the scales are more balanced.<br/>

It is interesting to see that when I long ago argued that our melee skills<br/>
were only barely superior to that of shamans there were many who argued<br/>
vehemently that we were far better at melee.  It seems now that more bards<br/>
are beginning to agree that our melee skills are not far beyond those of<br/>
some of the &quot;pure&quot; casters.<br/>

Actually his statement is exactly right.  Our Melee skills are hardly our<br/>
defining trait.  Being only barely a notch above shaman and druids in our<br/>
melee ability.  Sure we get dual wield but they can wield 2h blunt weapons.<br/>
So we&#39;re better at melee, but not near on par with the &#39;true&#39; melee classes<br/>
that get dual wield and double attack or just double attack but can wield<br/>
2hs weapons or 1hs and use a shield to bash.  Either way, any of the real<br/>
melee classes are &quot;defined&quot; by their melee skills.  We are &quot;defined&quot; by our<br/>
ability to sing songs.<br/>
<br/>
(and almost any bard will tell you that our songs are far more powerful than<br/>
our melee ability)<br/>
