Monsters can &quot;sense&quot; when you are scared or weak - like when you sit to heal<br/>
or med - and they will come and attack you.  I used this fact quite a bit to<br/>
&quot;re-pull&quot; the injured wolf or lion who is running away trying to train me to<br/>
some bandits.  All you have to do is sit and they will reverse course and<br/>
make a bixie-line for you and attack.  I bet your wiz can attest to being<br/>
attacked by little greenies while medding.<br/>
<br/>
In WC at 14, you are on the bottom of the food chain.  You can solo wisps<br/>
but cant take derves.  Well, there a big difference between a derv and a<br/>
wisp.  Remember that the con color only shows the amount of xp you might get<br/>
from winning - not how hard the fight will be.  Dervs are tougher than wisps<br/>
- even if they con the same color (which they prolly don&#39;t)  If you don&#39;t<br/>
wanna risk death, don&#39;t fight the hard stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Holding off and letting the mobs get good and aggro on your tanks is a good<br/>
thing!<br/>
<br/>
You can be paraniod if you want (and name is not taken and gets thru the<br/>
filter) but I will always be...<br/>

		I definitely made a similar post a little while back asking<br/>
about the<br/>
		problems we have with those creatures that just don&#39;t like<br/>
us singing,<br/>
		drumming, whatever while our group is sitting down resting<br/>
for the<br/>
		next fight.<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, on the few times I&#39;ve actually grouped, it&#39;s usually<br/>
to fight<br/>
		the mean old dervs at their camp.  Now to put this in<br/>
context, when<br/>
		I&#39;m solo, I don&#39;t die.  Actually, sometimes I have died but<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
		usually when I get greedy and take on 3 wisps, only to be<br/>
barely alive<br/>
		as the last one is nearly dead and suddenly I&#39;m asking<br/>
myself how I<br/>
		didn&#39;t hear that kodiak tiptoe up behind me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Is it a case of holding off for a little while before doing<br/>
the songs<br/>
		... similar to being a wiz and holding back zapping until<br/>
the fighter<br/>
		types have made the beasts dislike them enough?  I can do<br/>
that, but<br/>
		then it seems a bit daft.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Or maybe I&#39;m alone in this, and I&#39;m just paranoid or silly<br/>
or both.</div>
