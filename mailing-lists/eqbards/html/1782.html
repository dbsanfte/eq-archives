<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685279393"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  If you are a wizard (or a bard in this case), you would generally not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wear items such as &gt;platemail as it&#39;s weight and restrictivness in movement<br/>
would hinder the caster&#39;s ability; &gt;however, it doesn&#39;t mean that they<br/>
couldn&#39;t equip/wear the item, it just would introduce a &gt;possibilty of<br/>
penalties (ie. more difficult to cast successfully through lower dex and<br/>
lower &gt;agility).  So to give my opinion, the bard should be allowed to where<br/>
plate, if he / she wants.<br/>
<br/>
I saw this post and it made me think a bit on where I stand on this.  I seem<br/>
to recall that the Knights Templar had a group within that order that was<br/>
responsible for recording their history -- a sort of warrior/priest/bard if<br/>
you will.  I&#39;m sure that if you spent enough time at it, you would be able<br/>
to find a plethora of historical examples to justify how you want to RP your<br/>
bard.  I say do what you want.<br/>
<br/>
The only beef I have is that I believe that a bard&#39;s choice of armor should<br/>
affect our skills and songs.  Sneaking, for example, should be severely<br/>
curtailed if you are wearing metallic armor, as the clank, clank of the<br/>
metal clashing together would require greater sneaking skill to keep quiet.<br/>
Similarly, playing a stringed instrument or lockpicking should be affected<br/>
by the gloves or gauntlets you are wearing.  As many have pointed out, it is<br/>
hard to pluck those strings dextriously with 3 pound metal gloves on.  And<br/>
as a singer in my OOC life, I also argue that your voice should be affected<br/>
when you are wearing headgear.  Anatomically speaking, the bones in your<br/>
skull act as resonating boards, which I imagine is very important when you<br/>
use singing spells like the bellow.  A leather cap wouldn&#39;t bother you much,<br/>
but a plate helm would swallow up your voice, even with the visor up.  You<br/>
would probably damage your own eardrums bellowing in plate.<br/>
<br/>
I think this would add to the RP abiltiy of the bard.  If you want to play<br/>
the rogueish type, you would have to stay away from plate.  If you want to<br/>
play the tank, you forgo some of the other abilities of the class.  You get<br/>
to choose how you want to play, and the only barriers you have are a bit of<br/>
healthy realism.<br/>
<br/>
These changes should not necessarily affect only our class.  We happen to be<br/>
the most diverse, so it may affect us more than some others.</div>
