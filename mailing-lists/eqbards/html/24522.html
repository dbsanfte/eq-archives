 </span></blockquote>Lol. Interesting thoughts. Of course, just because this is a &quot;moon&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean it has to be anything like what we think of as a moon (ie. no <br/>
atmosphere, low gravity, no rotation therefore having a &quot;dark side&quot;.) <br/>
Actually, you would expect a lower gravity since, I believe, by definition, <br/>
a moon would be a smaller planet. Perhaps if it is made of a more dense <br/>
core it would have a stronger pull of gravity to compensate for it&#39;s lack <br/>
of size? Not an astrophysicist, so I wouldn&#39;t know. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the screenshots pretty much show that this &quot;moon&quot; is basically a <br/>
prettier Norrath with more detailing, ie. Norrath 2.<br/>
