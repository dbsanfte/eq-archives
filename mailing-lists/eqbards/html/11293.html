<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035289339">Not hard to do, just refrain from shouting and /ooc&#39;ing.  If we all you say<br/>
or tell nobody will be overly bothered who isn&#39;t involved.  Verant sits<br/>
still for their own bugs penalizing other players game experience every day.<br/>
They ignore player&#39;s bug reports despite our giving very specific info that<br/>
makes it obvious there is a problem and where it exists.<br/>

I would like to make one sidebar comment:<br/>
<br/>
I think the monks sit-in is the last one that will have any effect, either<br/>
with the players or with Verant.  There was a Cleric sit-in on Fennin Ro<br/>
last night of about 50 or so level 1 clerics.  I can assure you *everyone*<br/>
in the zone was very angry with these clerics.  They were lagging the zone<br/>
horribly and spamming the zone (intentionally and unintentionally) with<br/>
shouts and ooc.  If we want to make a point with Verant, we need to try and<br/>
find a way to do so that doesn&#39;t penalize other players&#39; game experience.<br/>
Verant won&#39;t sit still for that.<br/>
