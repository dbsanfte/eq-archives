<div id="ygrps-yiv-349345022">Hmm, SS room already?  That is prime xp territory. I love to get guild<br/>
groups there. Where will you go at 48,49, & 50?  For 45, 46, 47,and to 50<br/>
even, I killed alot of spectres - mostly solo (I&#39;d say 80-90% of my 45 was<br/>
&#39;solo&#39; - ie ungrouped helpers at times buffing & healing but one heck of<br/>
alot of fear/chaining.)  Until 47, single pulls are hard unless the spots<br/>
are heavily camped.  Oasis, Feerott & OOT are the prime spectre spots.<br/>
Soloing them is a possibility at 45 but risky.  With a partner, should be<br/>
quite easy.  Another partner spot is Cyndreela outside the TV in the PoF<br/>
cave (but that is like guard camping except you fight a caster instead of a<br/>
melee class. Kill, heal/med, rinse, repeat.)  Other wise, outside Permafrost<br/>
Ice Giants,  OOT seafury cyclops, rathe mts hg&#39;s, Lower Guk King Room, Ghoul<br/>
Lord Room, Frenzied. Kedge Keep with ppl who know what they are doing and<br/>
the correct classes but this is an unlikely pickup group spot.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Anyone got any tips on good hunting places at level 45? I am currently<br/>
&gt; almost 1 bub into 45 and am hoping to be out of 45 by the time Kunark is<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been fighting bats/bugs in sol b (I like camping stone spider<br/>
&gt; room.....lots of space nice an easy to charm mobs), should I stay here or<br/>
&gt; is there other &#39;Hot Spots&#39; for exp that maybe I should try.....I don&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; guard killing, it is dull and boring...<br/>
