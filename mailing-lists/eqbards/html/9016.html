<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-932829077">I also was thinking along the similar lines but did not want to say anything<br/>
untill I tested it for sure.. (still havent) but almost always when I use<br/>
lullaby I would most of the time pull back away from group so that the<br/>
caster could target the mob instead of assisting me.<br/>
<br/>
Also I used it alot in MM when pulling to many I would cast it while<br/>
running(not looking back) and when I got to the group only the one I pulled<br/>
would be on my butt.(that was a couple few patched ago though)<br/>

&gt;I noticed an odd effect in Lullaby and concluded that perhaps I (and most<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;this list) were wrong about just how it worked.  I was fighting bandits in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>W<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;karana and was easily getting some of the blue ones to nod while I killed<br/>
&gt;the others one at a time.  However, I noticed that if you were actually in<br/>
&gt;melee range the bandit would nod, but still attack.  If i backed off they<br/>
&gt;just stood there and nodded.  I assumed from this that in fact lullaby<br/>
&gt;merely reduced the aggro range to melee instead of stunning them.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt;this was a change and the stealth nerf we are discussing?<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hmm. I&#39;ve tried lullaby on other players at least twice since March and<br/>
&gt;&gt; it never worked at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried it in the Arena about a month ago.  At least one of<br/>
&gt;the players reported it was stunning him, though he was only<br/>
&gt;level 24 (to my 35 at the time).  This was back when I was<br/>
&gt;first beginning to suspect Strike was broken, so we didn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt;any of the tests I suggested.<br/>
