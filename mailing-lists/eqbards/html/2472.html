&gt; No no, I&#39;ve encountered no camps yet. Forage is a really difficult one to <br/>
&gt; raise since it recycles so seldom and fails a lot. Keep trying, it&#39;ll go <br/>
&gt; up. As far as other caps - I&#39;m sneaking about at 60 or so (and rising) at <br/>
&gt; 23rd, so that&#39;s not capped at 40 for sure. Seriously doubt other skills are <br/>
&gt; capped, wouldn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid they are. And yes, for some of them, it makes very little<br/>
sense. At least to me, it makes very little sense as far as &quot;game play&quot;<br/>
goes. Forage caps at bad (unless you are a wood elf, in which case your<br/>
built in racial skill is higher than the bard&#39;s skill ever gets). It<br/>
wont go past that no matter how much you practice and if you try to<br/>
train it at your guild you get a message that you have reached your<br/>
limit for that skill (not the same message as when you try to train past<br/>
20 in smithing for instance) Other skills such as hide also cap at very<br/>
low values.<br/>
<br/>
I dont mind that some of our skills are capped at relatively low values,<br/>
like safe fall, because at least a low value of safe fall still works<br/>
with smaller falls, so sailing over the dunes of Ro is a little less<br/>
dangerous at full bard speed, though by the time you get it, the amount<br/>
of damage you would take from the falls it saves you from is pretty<br/>
negligible.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the case of forage and hide, I don&#39;t understand why they<br/>
even gave us them with such low caps. With forage, you&#39;d have to keep a<br/>
hot key in one of your main quick key pages and be mashing it every time<br/>
it came up again to have a hope of getting enough food to make the<br/>
button mashing worthwhile. Hide is likewise a waste of time because the<br/>
only way to even know if it succeeded is to ask someone else in your<br/>
party if you disappeared, because you always disappear on your own<br/>
screen. I tried one day to hide with my skill maxed and gave up after my<br/>
companions started to get tired of me asking for the 15&#39;th time &quot;have I<br/>
disappeared yet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All I&#39;ve found these to skills to do is provide ammunition for people to<br/>
claim the bard is over powered because we get all these skills from<br/>
other classes that we shouldn&#39;t. Skills I&#39;ve found that I&#39;d rather not<br/>
have than have people point to as reasons why we are too powerful<br/>
include hide, sneak, forage and instill doubt. Of the 3 rogue skills in<br/>
this list, the only one even the Rogues I know find useful is hide and<br/>
the they only use that to go afk for a bit (or that one in a million<br/>
time they use a Cazic potion)<br/>
