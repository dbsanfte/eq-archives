<div id="ygrps-yiv-959515551">Well, when going in with a group to combat charming mobs, such as Drez in<br/>
Najena, and the hags in Unrest, my group has me rotate two of the shield<br/>
songs.  Those running, plus the spell endure magic, pushes magic resistance<br/>
up to over 100.  When we do that, we have yet to have anyone charmed in our<br/>
group.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fighting drakes, I always sung Elemental Rhythms, guess I was just wasting<br/>
&gt;my time.  What a let-down, and I never would have noticed!  Seemed like it<br/>
&gt;helped once in a while--probably just luck.  A placebo song!<br/>
