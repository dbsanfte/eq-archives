<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101661304">The one time I saw the lesser blade fiend it was also on the first floor<br/>
just inside the left porch doorway.  However, I was told by my party members<br/>
it spawns in the basement.  The time I saw it someone had started a massive<br/>
train from the basement.  They fled to the zone and all kinds of nasty stuff<br/>
followed them, including the blade fiend.  After the train went by, someone<br/>
in our party went inside, saw the blade fiend inside the doorway, attacked<br/>
it and pulled it out to the courtyard.  I think what happened is that the<br/>
party that started the train zoned so the mobs in the train all started to<br/>
move back to their spawn point.  The blade fiend never made it outside so<br/>
hung around the doorway before heading back to the basement.   <br/>

&gt; Each time I saw it, it was hanging out on the main floor.  I do agree with<br/>
&gt; the level... It was conning blue to me at level 20 or 21, IIRC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s found in Unrest, off the Lesser Blade Fiend (thus far, <br/>
&gt; &gt; my favorite<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob with regards to looks: picture a rock dervish with <br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; stones).  The spawn is supposedly rare in itself, with the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gladius being<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rare drop.  I&#39;ve heard rumor it comes from the basement, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue to me somewhere in my high teens.<br/>
