<div id="ygrps-yiv-852011410">We got wind of this GM event that was gonna happen in Mistmoore so we headed<br/>
on over.  Sure enough, on the ramp near the zone was Lord Mistmoore (GM in<br/>
PC looked like male DE), Lord Garamont (sp? a NPC), &quot;a wounded elf&quot; (NPC),<br/>
and another NPC (if i recall correctly.) And they were trying to carry on<br/>
some role playing dialog and unfold some story.<br/>
<br/>
Trying is about the best way to describe it.  It was happening amidst the<br/>
semi-normal MM zone stuff &quot;blahblah auctions, WTB Ykesha or SMR send tells&quot;)<br/>
and of course the crowd of on-lookers some of whom were determined to<br/>
disrupt.  Not too long into the event - like 10 minutes max, some jerk &quot;bind<br/>
pulls&quot; the castle (he binds at the zone next to the event, goes invis into<br/>
the castle, agros a bunch of stuff, gates back to his bind point, goes back<br/>
invis, and starts yelling &quot;TRAIN TO THE ZONE!&quot;  I guess he wanted to scare<br/>
everyone into leaving. Heh, he also forgot that once you agro, re-invising<br/>
is useless.  The train eventually caught up with him and smooshed him.<br/>
<br/>
The GM&#39;s started /kill-ing all the train crap and dutifully got back to<br/>
their tale.  Well, not too long into it, some other guy decides to attack<br/>
one of the &quot;quest&quot; NPC&#39;s.  &quot;Lord Mistmoore begins to cast a spell...&quot; and<br/>
the guy is summoned to Everfrost.  Then an enchanter decides to charm one of<br/>
the NPC characters and makes it say: &quot;My leader is Raloon!&quot;  Poof, he is<br/>
disconnected and dumped to his desktop.  Then some loose castle train npc<br/>
attacks a lev 50 wizard who was watching the event.  He casts an ice comet<br/>
and &quot;poof&quot; he is summoned to Tox forest.  While he is there, he sees another<br/>
player who was trying to harass the event, an oger, who was also summoned to<br/>
Tox.  Guess the GM&#39;s who summoned him forgot that Oger is KOS to the Erud<br/>
guards who are now death looping this guy.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, I left.  Do people want any &quot;role play&quot; in this game?  Do<br/>
they want GM events and dynamic quests? Do they want to learn the &quot;lore&quot; of<br/>
Norrath?  All I can say is that it sure seems like they (the playing & so<br/>
called paying customers) sure dont. If I were the GM/Guides who had to<br/>
endure that - I&#39;d be handing in my resegnation.  The players suck. Verant<br/>
sucks (for making them do this without the appropriate support and tools to<br/>
make it work.)  It really saddened me to see this debacle.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we mustered some guildies and made a small excursion into Kedge.<br/>
We killed Cauldron, Undertow & Estrella.  Our rogue got some Kedgemail<br/>
Gloves.  Estrella had 2 of something wands? We did not see the bard drum<br/>
mob - someone said place holder was up.  Nor was Phinnie up else we&#39;d have<br/>
killed him like we did Friday night.<br/>

p.s. ok, i&#39;ll put all the crap news into one post.  Some of the &quot;smaller&quot;<br/>
guilds on our server, ie ones that dont have enough 46-50&#39;s to do planes or<br/>
dragons on their own, banded together to make their first excursion into the<br/>
Plane of Fear.  They &quot;reserved&quot; the zone (on our server, the larger guilds<br/>
have an informal agreement so that guilds can &#39;reserve&#39; alter:Planes and not<br/>
race or crowd each other.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, the guys who lead this raid had been in as guests with a couple of the<br/>
bigger guilds so they sort of had some idea of how things work. Let&#39;s just<br/>
say that while they had a bunch of rangers and druids they really could have<br/>
used some more clerics - one or 2 was not enough for the 30 of them.   Even<br/>
so they were doing &quot;ok&quot; until some naked necro jerk (yes, we know who he is)<br/>
decided to come in and do some &quot;exploring.&quot;  Of course, he agro&#39;d the zone<br/>
and trained stuff onto the raiders and they got teleported all over and<br/>
died.  Some were seriously wondering if they were ever gonna get their<br/>
equipment back.  And by then it was 2 am Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
But the next day, another larger guild had the Plane reserved and went in<br/>
and did the break in.  Then I guess they helped with CR and everyone from<br/>
the smaller guilds got their stuff out.  One of my friends who had lost his<br/>
corpse the night before said to me the next day (after he got his stuff<br/>
back) that yes he died repeatedly, yes it was damn scary, and yes it was<br/>
them most fun he&#39;s had in a long time even though he was sure he&#39;d lost all<br/>
his stuff.<br/>
