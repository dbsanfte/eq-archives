<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831054889">Actually it can.  We aren&#39;t hybrids like the others.  They USE mana and they<br/>
ARE hybrids.  They lump bards in with &#39;hybrids&#39; for lack of a better area<br/>
for us.  We aren&#39;t melee we aren&#39;t casters therefore they stick us with<br/>
hybrids to categorise us.<br/>
<br/>
I still get a kick out of people thinking there is some kind of XP &quot;penalty&quot;<br/>
for being a hybrid.  It&#39;s not a &quot;penalty&quot; it&#39;s just harder to level certain<br/>
classes than it is to level others.  This is due to varying benefits that<br/>
each class has.   Go look at an AD&D players handbook and look at the xp<br/>
differences for each class.  If you look in a 1st Edition one you can even<br/>
look at bards and realize that they are the single hardest class in AD&D to<br/>
level (had to level to 10 in warrior, 10 in thief then switch to bard and<br/>
level on an xp curve comparable to that of a paladin.).<br/>
<br/>
As to why we didn&#39;t get the mana bonus?  Uhhh we never had the mana penalty<br/>
and our mana isn&#39;t used in the same way anyway.  I don&#39;t remember the last<br/>
time I ran out of mana so... no offense... who cares.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY thing I agreed with in that post was the part about lullaby and<br/>
chains and pixie.  That was the only valid point that the player brought up.<br/>
Abashi&#39;s response is, unfortunately, typical.  I gave up  long ago on ever<br/>
seeing pixie/lulaby fixed and recently gave up on seeing chains being put<br/>
back the way it belongs.  To be honest I can even see Verant&#39;s reasoning for<br/>
their snare nerf (and it wasn&#39;t just us, get over that, it affected rangers<br/>
and druids too)<br/>
