<div id="ygrps-yiv-933663441">I am not &quot;set on the staff&quot; - it is set on me!  I cant find anything better.<br/>
I am doing a lot of 2 person killing and cant not melee.  <br/>
<br/>
What goes around comes around - who said that?  I have been pretty heavily<br/>
twinked thru out my career and now am gonna try to get some stuff the old<br/>
fashioned way - camp for it! Armor twinking for young bards is kinda ok but<br/>
to twink the uber weps is gonna hurt more than help. Here I am level 37 and<br/>
still camping the Scryer and Warden - hey I spent my 20&#39;s on Karana Fried<br/>
Chicken and HighKeep Gobs - no time for real serious dungeon fighting.  now<br/>
I am sorry I missed Runnyeye and Upper when they matched my levels.  Ok, so<br/>
Runny can still get me killed and give me some xp and Borxx is still fun to<br/>
kill (yes, of course in a group! no not another amazing I solo&#39;d that<br/>
story.)<br/>
<br/>
So, twink carefully my fiends - it gets real boring at the later levels and<br/>
some of them last a real long time...... and if you have all the toys<br/>
already... you will get bitter.<br/>

		Staff of Writhing, Runed Falchion, Crystalline Blade, <br/>
		  Thullian Claws, and a few more are primary hand only.<br/>
<br/>
		  An obs scim is kinda weak ratiowise for a bard, but<br/>
		  druids like it a lot.  I&#39;ve never had an obs shard.<br/>
		  The silvery axe is good.  It looks like you are set<br/>
		  on the staff.  There is a electrum bladed wazikashi,<br/>
		  but it&#39;s probably out of your league in obtaining it<br/>
		  unless you talk a level 50 druid into camping it for<br/>
		  4-8 hours, even then he&#39;ll probably want to twink his<br/>
		  own character with it after all that work, assuming<br/>
		  some buttonblasting wizard leaves the Caitliff alive.<br/>
<br/>
		  You really don&#39;t have many outlets for good weapons<br/>
		  until you dual Yks.  Rumor is they will disappear<br/>
		  soon, so the chances of getting those is getting<br/>
		  slimmer too.  Then again, rumors are just that - rumors.<br/>
<br/>
		  My suggestion, stick with your old guns, and beg your<br/>
		  favorite druid to assist you in getting EBWs (7/21)<br/>
		  One of the best 1hs ratios in the game, better ratio<br/>
		  than a Yk, except no proc.  You&#39;ll begin to feel the<br/>
		  outshadowing of your melee the closer to 50 you get.<br/>
		  While I contribute a hefty amount of dmg, I see the<br/>
		  SKs and Pals doing 80-100 per round, and the warriors<br/>
		  around 100-150, and the monks 150+ (on a good day)<br/>
<br/>
		  What are all the level 40+ people here wielding now?<br/>
<br/>
