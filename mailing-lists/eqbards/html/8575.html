Choon and Froon live in the Western Plain of Karana. Don&#39;t know them too<br/>
well but they they are roughly equal near 30.  Saw Cappenvarra charm them<br/>
and fight among themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Broon - wuss clops lives in Eastern Plain of Karana - starting spawn spot in<br/>
river North of wooden bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Droon -  Broon&#39;s older bro - when broon is blue to you droon is yellow (I<br/>
started fighting Broon high 20&#39;s and lo 30&#39;s - a mob of mixed 20&#39;s can<br/>
prolly take broon)<br/>
<br/>
Proon - papa of Broon and Droon - deeeeeeeeeeeeep red (40+) just zone or<br/>
/tell merlain come kill proon PLEASE!!! zoning<br/>
<br/>
Broon hunting 101<br/>
<br/>
Get a partner: tanks are good, druids are good, rangers too, never had a<br/>
caster to try it with but prolly ok but risky for caster.<br/>
<br/>
Find Broon in river and pull him out (trust me). Kill him: chain or snare,<br/>
fear and bellow and melee, chords if you have a clear spot to fight.  Loot<br/>
fast! Make sure you are well away from his spawn spot because Droon respawns<br/>
in river real fast and can jump u b4 u are healed up.<br/>
<br/>
Let Droon go unattacked and he will vanish in a minute or two.  Mean while<br/>
run to the Highhold ramp and camp at the mouth of the lower canyon.  Prolly<br/>
polite to warn zone to stay clear of the lower canyon.<br/>
<br/>
Every 8 minutes Broon will respawn in the lower canyon and come lumbering<br/>
out.  Chain/snare, Fear, DoT, Melee, Kill, rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Loot is crap - small coins and occasional rusty.  Well your weps would be<br/>
rusty too if you stood in the river most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
One time I did loot a Top Knot Cap (ac 3 non-visible when worn) from a clops<br/>
but for the life of me I cant remember which clops - I do think it was in EK<br/>
zone and near HH ramp.  <br/>

		I can add that Greater Darkbones can be found in Unrest and<br/>
upper 20&#39;s in<br/>
		lvl.  I would also question Choon and Broon both being 30th<br/>
lvl.  I know one<br/>
		of them is a good several lvls above the other, but I forget<br/>
which.</div>
