Coward code means they don&#39;t attack<br/>
<br/>
During beta EVERYTHING attacked, regardless of your level.  In Guk/Cazic etc<br/>
after a certain point you can waltz by the entry area things that would<br/>
normally attack someone MUCH lower.  And run, then cause trains.<br/>
<br/>
Coward code prevents this by keeping ultra-green mobs from attacking anyone<br/>
X levels above them.  Any mob above 20th is immune to coward code, however,<br/>
and will attack anyway (dungeons were too easy or something).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate. the coward code prevents trains by keeping low level creatures<br/>
from going aggro on people.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Umm... something to remember:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Coward code, for whatever reason, is not implemented on undead found in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; wilderness.  They didn&#39;t bother.  Any undead you find in a _dungeon_<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; the coward code implemented.  This was because of the ungodly trains<br/>
that a<br/>
&gt; &gt; green conned skeleton would cause if for some reason someone would scare<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; During beta coward code was put on every npc in every dungeon.  The<br/>
undead<br/>
&gt; &gt; that wander around outside in the wild don&#39;t have it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How would coward code stop trains?  Seems to me having mobs<br/>
&gt; run away because you&#39;re red to them and aggroing other mobs<br/>
&gt; would cause more trains.  I think you&#39;re thinking of the code<br/>
&gt; that makes it so green mobs that normally aggro on you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unless they actually see you (i.e. they can&#39;t be triggered by<br/>
&gt; another aggro mob that runs past them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you sure they con indifferent?  I&#39;ll double check it next time I&#39;m<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; unrest but I don&#39;t recall invis working at all there.  Maybe they snuck<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; in with the invis/see invis patch?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They started conning indifferent when I hit around L23.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; since been raised to like L28 I think (a lot of bards were<br/>
&gt; complaining about invis not working on stuff anymore).  This<br/>
&gt; was a long long time ago, like last summer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There *is* something screwy with they way they&#39;ve classified<br/>
&gt; undead and normal mobs.<br/>
