&gt; Vampire, and gypsy (late, cant think of the exact names) spots in about 15<br/>

we&#39;re trying to break into the courtyard or have set up in the<br/>
courtyard and are preparing to work into the castle, some<br/>
idiot has to go take a looksie, usually while we&#39;re fighting,<br/>
and ends up dumping half the castle on us.<br/>
