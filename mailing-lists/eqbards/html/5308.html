<div id="ygrps-yiv-423398036">When I was your level, I had a snakeskin tunic and some patch with the odd<br/>
bit of looted leather and was just beginning to get some banded pieces.<br/>
But....knowing what I now know, here&#39;s a few tips.<br/>
<br/>
You want to balance your str, agi, & dex stats with boosters like studded or<br/>
spiked collars, derv rings, magic rings or earrings, magic bracers if you<br/>
can afford or acquire, rusty-spiked shoulders, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Get your agi and dex to 100. Then get your str up as high as you can.  Look<br/>
at armor and wear the best AC-to-weight ratio pieces if you have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Bear gloves from Ged Twigborn in Kithicor Wood (look out for the skellies<br/>
and ghouls - he wanders right past them - also those Shraylock Orcs are near<br/>
the other end of his route, and the odd griz walks about.)  Bring him a HQ<br/>
bear and 25gp - have exact change - take like 30gp in case he raises price<br/>
based on faction/charisma.  Unless of course you have a HQ LION and 96gp -<br/>
then get those.<br/>
<br/>
Bear Boots for sure & possibly other items from Chanda & Baobob Miller in<br/>
Qeynos Hills at the Surefall Glade tunnel.  Go talk to Baobob first, then he<br/>
will tell you how to get Chanda to talk to you.<br/>
<br/>
Polar bear cloak from Karg in Everfrost.  You will need a ranger to track<br/>
him and you will have to be pretty carefull out there - skellies and ice<br/>
bone skellies not to mention the snow leopards.  He wants a polar bear skin<br/>
and 5pp for his cloak.  If you have lots of pp, buy as many cloaks as you<br/>
can and go sell them in Freeport, N. Ro & Oasis.  Yes for some odd reason<br/>
the desert dwelling casters get real cold? (It&#39;s one of the few things they<br/>
can wear for ac and they will pay 15pp and sometimes more.  They like the<br/>
bear boots too!)<br/>
<br/>
Derv rings for dex.<br/>
<br/>
There are magic earrings for str but they go for like 40pp each - made by<br/>
jewelers. That&#39;s a lot of wisps! <br/>
<br/>
Snakeskin tunic is good for you since you will be hunting snake for quite a<br/>
few more levels.  <br/>
<br/>
Also go see Menkes Tabolet in South Qeynos - near docks he wanders around.<br/>
He will make you a snake fang necklace sv +2 poison.  Heck, he will make you<br/>
as many as you can carry - get a bunch and head up to East Commonlands and<br/>
sell to guys who get bit by snakes near the Ro tunnel.  When you are sitting<br/>
there watching the hp drop slowly even after the snake is dead, suddenly 1pp<br/>
for sv +2 poison starts to look pretty good!  Also, they been spammed with<br/>
auctions for things at 4pp to 40pp and would like something to buy that they<br/>
can afford - this is a good thing to sell em - also a baby rare if they are<br/>
from Freeport or Neriak.  Never had any left by the time I&#39;d get to Fay but<br/>
I&#39;d bet they&#39;d sell good there too.<br/>
<br/>
Your str affects 2 things:<br/>
<br/>
how much weight your can carry - which says what mix of ac you can have<br/>
<br/>
how much damage you can possibly deliver<br/>
<br/>
So - you if you are like me - want to add stuff to max str.  Get used to the<br/>
idea that you cant haul much loot without encumberment.  My #1 hot key is<br/>
Anthem.  I tried using dimensional pockets and spirit pouches but lost too<br/>
many things:<br/>

		Well it&#39;s mostly armour I think.  As a lowly wood elf who is<br/>
somewhat<br/>
		weak, I&#39;m finding it more and more difficult to cope with<br/>
all the<br/>
		armour and weapons I carry, and still be able to pick up<br/>
some loot.<br/>
<br/>
		My str is somewhere around 80 (memory failure!).  And before<br/>
I even<br/>
		set out to hunt I&#39;m carrying all but 10 of it.  Now ok, I&#39;m<br/>
kitted out<br/>
		in some fairly decent armour, mostly banded and ringmail,<br/>
and a piece<br/>
		of bronze, so I&#39;m well protected.  But it&#39;s rather heavy!<br/>
<br/>
		So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of<br/>
armour I can<br/>
		get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives,<br/>
or<br/>
		somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can<br/>
even go<br/>
		out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income<br/>
if cheap<br/>
		isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks all<br/>
