<br/>
A weapon like a Polished Granite Tomahawk that has a proc, activates by <br/>
itself randomly as you fight.<br/>
<br/>
Other items that have an effect, like Mask of Deception, need to be <br/>
activated by &quot;right-clicking&quot; on them (make sure you aren&#39;t singing any <br/>
songs or it won&#39;t activate).<br/>

&gt;someone please tell me how they work?  I had assumed the weapons would proc<br/>
&gt;on their own just by fighting with them.  How do you get a pair of pants to<br/>
&gt;proc?  I&#39;d hate to think clothing that procs Gate would go off randomly from<br/>
&gt;wearing it.  Right-click the stuff or something?<br/>
