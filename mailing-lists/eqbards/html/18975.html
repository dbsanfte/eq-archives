<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031449097">Rokenn I like it where it is.  A link from them to you might be nice, but host?  Hmm<br/>
I agree with the others.  They strike me as being often out of date.<br/>
<br/>
We have a link on our guild page to your site.  I frequently tell bards about it<br/>
because it is such a fantastic resource.  Kudos again to you and all the<br/>
contributors.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you decide, it would be nice to avoid a ripple of broken links if possible<br/>
=).<br/>
