<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935753047">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to confirm something that I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve read, but haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to confirm from Bard Song Analysis site. This came across last <br/>
night as I was grouped with another bard, which hasn&#39;t happened to me in a <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
If there are 2 bards in the group and both are singing Chorus of Clarity, <br/>
is mana recovered faster than if just 1 were singing it? I checked with <br/>
some bards logged on-line last night and received a &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; and a <br/>
&quot;yes, most definitely&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the &quot;no&quot; answer came from a bard who didn&#39;t realize that Anthem <br/>
de Arms was an Atk speed buff, and thought that Whistling Warsong buffed <br/>
the entire party. : ) Man, he needs to read Rokken&#39;s website.<br/>
