&gt; Over the last three<br/>
&gt; days...hmmm...that means since the last patch...hmmmm...I have had problems<br/>
&gt; receiving /tells.  At least 6 different people have complained that they<br/>
&gt; sent me /tells and I never responded.<br/>

can see the list by just typing /ignore; if not you can do an explicit /ignore and see if they got toggled<br/>
(from ignore to not ignore).  It might clear it up, anyway.  Reminds me of a joke:<br/>
<br/>
Four guys are in a car, a mechanical engineer, a chemical engineer, an electrical engineer, and a computer<br/>
engineer.  The car breaks down.  The mechanical engineer says that it&#39;s a problem with the pistons, they<br/>
need to get the car towed so the engine can be reworked.  The electrical engineer insists it&#39;s a problem<br/>
with the wiring.  The chemical engineer thinks it&#39;s a fuel problem; if the drain the fuel lines it should<br/>
clear the problem up.  They turn to the computer engineer, who has been silent to this point, and ask him<br/>
what he thinks.  &quot;I have no idea&quot;, he responds, &quot;but if we all get out of the car, slam the doors real<br/>
hard, and get back in, it might start up again.&quot;<br/>
