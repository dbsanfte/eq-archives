<div id="ygrps-yiv-836470428">I&#39;ve been living in KEdge Keep for at least a dozen levels with my druid, <br/>
and hitting it with my bard whenever Cauldron Boil was up. This is the same <br/>
strategy we (and everyone) should use. Don&#39;t wait for EB to flash.<br/>
<br/>
Finally! After killing him I don&#39;t know how many time (15?) I got me <br/>
kedgemail gauntlets! Jeez, HH helms dropping like candy, but took forever <br/>
for those stupid gloves to drop.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Each group should have a designated EB person.  And that person needs to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We just have the EBer cast at :00, :20, and :40 after the<br/>
&gt;hour.  Make sure each group also has a secondary source of EB<br/>
&gt;in case the main dies or goes linkdead.<br/>
