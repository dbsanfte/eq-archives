<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Finding a guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-97852752">You may run into the same problem with guilds that I have.  I found a<br/>
great  guild, one that suits my playstyle and attitude<br/>
  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the advice :)  I am lucky in that respect because I have a few<br/>
friends who play the same hours I do so the group aspect is never really an<br/>
issue for me.  Besides if you sit and chat long enough you&#39;ll always find<br/>
someone to group with :)  Heck some times I have even found groups for other<br/>
people...maybe I should start charging.....<br/>
<br/>
  Before I played my bard I spent time &quot;testing&quot; out characters and learning<br/>
a bit about each class.  By the time I got to my &quot;real character&quot; - bard- I<br/>
knew what guild I wanted to join.  For me it was easy - their name alone was<br/>
perfect for my bard style :)<br/>
<br/>
  Now it&#39;s just the waiting *twiddle*<br/>
