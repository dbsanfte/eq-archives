&gt;The Mask, on the other hand, does nothing more than change the appearance of<br/>

&gt;think by the time they could get the mask, their faction with the<br/>
&gt;IndigoBrothers (or whatever the Inkie faction is) would be so screwed that<br/>
&gt;any faction benefits gained from taking Inkie form would be negated.<br/>

a medium size race in tight dungeons without having to get a shrink.  this is actually<br/>
quite a big deal.</div>
