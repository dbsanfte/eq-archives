<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037730384">so given all these things, what are you left with?  if you happen to end<br/>
up in a tank group<br/>
  (you will almost never be put in the pull group due to bard song random<br/>
aggro bugs) then<br/>
  you could play level 1 song and heal and damage shield if you really<br/>
wanted to, but i would<br/>
  suggest parking yourself next to the cleric and singing mana song while<br/>
swinging weapons.<br/>
  if you are in a caster group then there is not much point to singing<br/>
anything but mana song,<br/>
  heh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  - Now I find this funny.  You recomend that as a bard use weapons.  And<br/>
yet just yesterday someone went on about how the &quot;battle bard&quot; is not a<br/>
great idea.... *HURM*<br/>
