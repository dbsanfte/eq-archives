&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remember this thread but can&#39;t remember who actually <br/>
&gt; posted.  Was it Absor<br/>
&gt; who posted the reply?  Or was it JM Capozzi (who we all <br/>
&gt; thought was a Verant<br/>
&gt; insider for a long time)?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the <br/>
&gt; first poster turned<br/>
&gt; out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy <br/>
&gt; who answered<br/>
&gt; him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him <br/>
&gt; has since shed<br/>
&gt; his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I <br/>
&gt; really like the<br/>
&gt; part about bards being able to heal more than clerics <br/>
&gt; &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>
&gt; does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be <br/>
&gt; fair - he may not<br/>
&gt; have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and <br/>
&gt; with only &quot;old<br/>
&gt; world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the <br/>
&gt; current use of a main<br/>
&gt; tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>
