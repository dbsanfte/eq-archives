<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Kaesora trouble <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-438591043"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Last night we (my bard and his guild) were on a guild raid of Kaesora.<br/>
&gt; Things were going great,  when my ISP decided it was time to crash.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now I am camped in the middle of a dangerous room with no chance of<br/>
&gt; running out.  My guild is unlikely to be able to muster up <br/>
&gt; enough force to<br/>
&gt; get there anytime soon (we are small, we needed outside help <br/>
&gt; getting this<br/>
&gt; far).  So what can i do?  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What server? Unless it&#39;s Povar I won&#39;t have a character high level enough to<br/>
help, unless there is some possible use for a level 1 Iksar, in which case I<br/>
would be happy to show up and help. :)<br/>
