<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378169554">The idea that the AI only uses the first spell gem is a myth.  I&#39;ll relate a<br/>
story that happened to me in Cazic as my druid months ago...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the lower throne room, I was a level 34 druid.  My group was a<br/>
warrior, 2 rogues, wizard, druid(me) and a cleric.  Great group, right?<br/>
Well, no way to prepare for what happened.<br/>
<br/>
The Tae Ew Diviner spawns (enchanter mob) and charms me right off the bat.<br/>
I sit there and watch what happens next with a sort of morbid fascination,<br/>
since I thought the AI only used 1 spell gem, too.<br/>
<br/>
I put a damage shield on the diviner.  Next I turned and rooted the warrior<br/>
away from the diviner.  I turned around and nuked the cleric 4 times,<br/>
killing her.  Then I healed the diviner.  My damage shield was tearing the<br/>
rogues in half, especially since both healers are now out of the picture.  I<br/>
then started meleeing one of the rogues (lucky him, cause druid melee<br/>
sucks).  The diviner nuked the heck out of the first rogue and killed him.<br/>
A gorilla spawned and killed the second rogue.  I sat there walking back and<br/>
forth for a minute like charmed mobs do, and then it broke.  The Diviner was<br/>
full health, no way was I gonna try that!  I headed for the zone and managed<br/>
to make it due to SoW.<br/>
<br/>
So there ya go, I&#39;ll never underestimate the AI ever again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge<br/>
&gt; &gt; to somehow help us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; survive a fight after we go linkdead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When charmed you are also an npc, and in all the times my bard was<br/>
&gt; &gt; charmed, which was a lot back in the days when shaman npc mobs could<br/>
&gt; &gt; charm, I never once played a song. The AI doesn&#39;t appearantly think<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs are spells.<br/>
