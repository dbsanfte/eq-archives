<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am confused now...I recently attended a guild<br/>
wedding at the Shadowed men monument in LFAY.<br/>
<br/>
Amid the fighting appeared an /anon bard who sang, &quot;A<br/>
shadowed man&#39;s eyes glaze over&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He then had great sport ordering it about...&quot;Sit down<br/>
you stupid lout!&quot; and it responded &quot;Sitting master&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What has me confused is this charm lasted easily<br/>
longer than 30 seconds...was this unusual or are we<br/>
talking about something different?<br/>
<br/>
