&gt; &gt; When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>
&gt; &gt; tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   With your knowledge of Lullaby now, would you even consider firing<br/>
&gt;   up that song in LGuk?  Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>
&gt;   30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. Now I know the real odds of it working? Nope. It was only loaded<br/>
because I&#39;d been using it in the Cazic CY with a all melee group earlier<br/>
that day and had forgot to swap it out. It had also worked ok in Cazic<br/>
that day too. Must have been a good day for the random number generator<br/>
though because the next time I tried it it didn&#39;t do much.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>
&gt; &gt; up screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>
&gt; &gt; evac.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That reminds me, always keep screech mem&#39;d ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   [connecting to shadowmen thread] This is how a bard can outrun<br/>
&gt;   shadowmen.  Selo&#39;s + Screech.  The shadowmen move so fast in the<br/>
&gt;   opposite direction that they are out of agro radius within about<br/>
&gt;   2 seconds and give up the chase.  So if someone asks you if you<br/>
&gt;   can outrun shadowmen, you can if you are creative.  Just twist<br/>
&gt;   Selos and Screech and take off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good idea. Didn&#39;t someone on the list say they used Selo&#39;s and Lullaby<br/>
once for a similar trick?<br/>
