&gt;sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>
&gt;classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>
&gt;easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>
&gt;die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>
&gt;what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this has<br/>
&gt;nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>
&gt;fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not having<br/>
&gt;fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is <br/>
&gt;&gt; enough of a<br/>
&gt;&gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games <br/>
&gt;&gt; - that there<br/>
&gt;&gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on <br/>
&gt;&gt; advancement and<br/>
&gt;&gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and <br/>
&gt;&gt; working with<br/>
&gt;&gt; others.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>
&gt;&gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived <br/>
&gt;&gt; &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>
&gt;&gt; &#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the <br/>
&gt;&gt; singleplayer<br/>
&gt;&gt; game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for <br/>
&gt;&gt; these worlds to<br/>
&gt;&gt; truly reach their full potential.<br/>
