<div id="ygrps-yiv-231628280"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; time there are only around 20 people in the<br/>
&gt; one.  Even with that low number of people,<br/>
&gt; lag still hits during the peak of battle.<br/>
&gt; I am starting to believe lag is more a<br/>
&gt; function of the zone you are in versus <br/>
&gt; your connection speed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two lag-zones that I&#39;ve noticed.. The area out front of (and inside of) the<br/>
Freeport Bank brings me to a crawl everytime. In ButcherBlock mountains, the<br/>
path leading directly to the docks - as soon as you turn the corner around<br/>
the mountain and can see the dock entrance - it slows down considerably.<br/>
Even with nobody else around. Also, the hallway just past the zone when<br/>
leaving Kaladim always lags for me until I get outside.<br/>
<br/>
It annoys me greatly the number of people that just sit in the bank at<br/>
Freeport doing absolutely nothing but taking up space. Last night I couldn&#39;t<br/>
even get INTO the bank because people were standing around blocking the<br/>
door, the hallway and then the windows as well as the door to get around<br/>
inside. There must have been no less than 30 people in the bank with maybe 6<br/>
using it. It not only creates incredible lag, but is quite annoying not<br/>
being able to get in.</div>
