<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023350358">Actually, at least in Warslik&#39;s woods, my cleric was able to Stun and Holy <br/>
Might various giants. However, my enchanter friend could *never* get a stun <br/>
to stick. Cleric stuns must be a bit different than the enchanter ones. <br/>
I&#39;ve never tried pixie striking a giant though, I just rely on charm.<br/>
