&gt; Actually I could go back and get my e-mail from the last great clouding debate where I did exactly that test the con and the result with invis on and invis off.  What I tend to think people forget is the possibilty of see invis being part of some of these creatures.  <br/>

run to the ghoul lord room unmolested with the cleric/enchanter invis to<br/>
undead, but not with the bard song, then clouding is not really invis to<br/>
undead. <br/>
