<div id="ygrps-yiv-195467">I think I see what you were saying now.  When I died at 30th level, the EXP<br/>
bar didn&#39;t drop very much.  I still lost the same amount of EXP I did when I<br/>
died at 29-, it just wasn&#39;t as noticeable because it takes so much extra EXP<br/>
to get thru those levels.  When you died at 47 and dropped to 46, your EXP<br/>
bar decreased a full bubble into 46.  Had you died at 46 with only a few<br/>
pixels to go before making 47th, you would only have lost maybe a 1/4<br/>
bub(normal EXP loss).  So in effect, when you died at 47 and dropped a full<br/>
bub into 46, you got penalized more than you should have.  Is that what you<br/>
were pointing out?<br/>

&gt; which ocurred without my having gained *any* experience into<br/>
&gt; the new level?  That way the exp loss was for the new level,<br/>
&gt; but was applied entirely to the old level, letting me do a<br/>
&gt; direct comparison to deaths in the old level.<br/>
