  Another thing about where you lost your corpse (if its the place I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about), that tunnel is one way.  There are exactly two ways out,<br/>
fire shield yourself as much as you can, swim in, get your stuff, zone to<br/>
sol B and hope you can make it out of the lava there before you die or<br/>
levitate, get your stuff and gate.<br/>
<br/>
  Neither of these options is very good.  IMO, its a bug in the software<br/>
that its one way (at least that&#39;s what a GM told a friend of mine who got<br/>
stuck there) but he didn&#39;t get any help either.  It was worse for him though<br/>
because he&#39;s a troll. Without the guise of deceiver or a shaman around he<br/>
can&#39;t even FIT in that area.<br/>
<br/>
  The fact that you reaquired your stuff speaks highly of you!<br/>
