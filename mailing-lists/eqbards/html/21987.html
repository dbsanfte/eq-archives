<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123075955">LOL!  Perhaps you should adjust that slightly to read:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Darkfox looks for something to bonk, sees a tank standing around&quot;<br/>
/bonk tank<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, that&#39;s not a bad idea.   I may add an emote to my assist<br/>
key.  Something along the lines of:<br/>
<br/>
Evulia closes her eyes, belts out a few tunes, and slashes wildly at<br/>
%target<br/>
<br/>
With any luck, even if I miss the emote, one of my group mates might notice<br/>
if I&#39;m slashing wildly at our puller, especially if I hit it before the<br/>
pullers gotten back to the group.<br/>

Peace<br/>

I find that if my Target is clear and once the /assisted tank starts<br/>
to fight, I don&#39;t get bugged too often.  If I have something already<br/>
targeted (whether player or mob), I get bugged alot.  It&#39;s easy for<br/>
me to keep my Target clear, but unfortunately, it&#39;s hard for my<br/>
group. :/  Is there a command to clear your Target?  It&#39;d be nice to<br/>
toss that into the /assist hotkey.  Also, if I /assist too early<br/>
(before the tank hits autoattack), I usually get something targeted<br/>
that&#39;s halfway across the zone.  It&#39;s strange.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve run into the same cranky Enchanters, heh... I know it must get<br/>
frustrating on a very large raid because there&#39;s so many people who<br/>
can possibly make a mistake, but they do need to understand<br/>
that /assist doesn&#39;t work 100%.  They need to play a Melee class to<br/>
see how it works before screaming at everyone.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO, my biggest complaint is when the main tank goes AFK or is busy<br/>
doing something!!!  Nothing is more annoying than hearing someone<br/>
chew out the whole raid about using assist properly, when the freakin<br/>
tank can&#39;t do his job!  I&#39;ve started adding a /bonk or /bleed to<br/>
my /assist hotkey, so I&#39;ll bonk or bleed on the target, or on nothing<br/>
REPEATEDLY if the tanks not doing his job.  And I mean repeatedly.<br/>
