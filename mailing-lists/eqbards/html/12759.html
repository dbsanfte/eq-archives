<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219432268">I don&#39;t read that board so let me know what kind of feedback, if any, it<br/>
generates.  I would think that someone has already posted the idea before in<br/>
one of the numerous EQ forums out there.  Plagiarism is the highest form of<br/>
flattery but if someone has already suggested the idea I sure don&#39;t want<br/>
them to think I&#39;m stealing their thunder.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, is the Guide board the official EQ general topic board or does &quot;Guide&quot;<br/>
refer to GM/Guide topics?  I used to read the General topic board at EQVault<br/>
but got tired of all the rants and flames.  If its a good forum I might<br/>
start checking it out. <br/>

&gt; Okay Galtin I got a friend to post your suggestion to the Guide boards.<br/>
&gt; hopefully someone of note will read it.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Here is an idea on how they can actually test changes on the test<br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Allow people to export copies of their characters from regular servers<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; give them a tag that indicates they are an imported character.  Their<br/>
&gt; names<br/>
&gt; &gt; would show up as a different color, say yellow since that will visibly<br/>
&gt; stand<br/>
&gt; &gt; out.  Yellow tagged characters can only be used on Test during specific<br/>
&gt; &gt; date/times to test specified areas of the game.  They don&#39;t gain<br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they can&#39;t loot any items.  They don&#39;t need EXP or items because<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are there for one reason only, to test changes made to the game.  Once<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; test period is complete, those characters can&#39;t log in to the Test<br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yellow tagged characters also would not be allowed to group with normal<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters.  This scenario should alleviate any concerns of the regular<br/>
&gt; Test<br/>
&gt; &gt; server players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>
