<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566302157">What a coincidence, that was what I dual wielded at 17<br/>
too, but better bring jaxons jag o&#39; vigor out of the<br/>
closet, because they are both big stamina hogs, and<br/>
you&#39;ll find yours dropping quickly.  At 21 I still use<br/>
a PGT and the Dragoon dirk, that way my peircing stays<br/>
up, and my stamina drain is about half of what it<br/>
would be with a tentacle whip.  Plus the dragoon dirk<br/>
has a better damage/delay ratio than the whip.  Of<br/>
course, I&#39;ve only use weapons half the time and<br/>
instead opt for discord, dissonance, and binding<br/>
weaves, and will probably only take them out to<br/>
practice once i get the rooting as well</div>
