<b>Subject:</b> appearance, charm song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-278141934">Regarding appearance:<br/>
As a bard I am interested in my appearance to my audience.  Of course<br/>
protecting my hide is also important!  I am searching for effective<br/>
armor which is either invisible or attractive (not a tin pot on the<br/>
head) for a female half-elf.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens (Level 27):<br/>
Which commands do others use with the charm song?  I have concentrated<br/>
on /pet attack and /pet guard me.  I am committed to practicing this<br/>
technique as I was impressed with John Kim&#39;s description of its power. <br/>
I am improving while using in Cazic-Thule but it is difficult to use! <br/>
Please share your tips and suggestions.</div>
