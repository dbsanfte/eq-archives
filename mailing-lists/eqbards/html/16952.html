&gt; &gt; &gt; Doh.  I hit 50 this weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Congrats!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, everyone who is congratulating me.  Dunno why, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just another number to me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am going to add my congratulations anyway haha.<br/>
<br/>
I find that 50 is different.  Better in some ways, not so good in others.  More<br/>
relaxing, and also more pressure to get into bigger events.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of server politics and so forth due to the overcrowding can make that<br/>
frustrating.  SOunds like you have an active guild though, which is nice =).<br/>
<br/>
The day I made 50, I had a perfectly miserable night the night before; I died twice<br/>
and had horribly long corpe recovery in lower Guk and live side.  What I thought was<br/>
an easy 1/4 bubble to get became 1/2 bubble by the end of the night.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning my in-game husband was on and we went to the safe hall on the dead<br/>
side (near the jail) and just stayed there for an hour or so.  After I leveled, he<br/>
had to go for awhile, and I went and collected the rest of the pieces I needed for<br/>
my black and gold outfit.  I put my lambent away that day =).  And then I just sort<br/>
of wandered around for awhile haha.  Hmmm come to think of it, someone still owes me<br/>
a party with lots of booze.<br/>
