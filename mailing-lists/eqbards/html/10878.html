&gt; So my question is, did I just hit Lower Guk on a bad night, or do I just<br/>
&gt; need to be more patient? This being a vulture stuff is hard :)<br/>

build up anything to train. If you try the live side entrance, live shin<br/>
knights also drop the items, and it would be a lot safer. The live<br/>
entrance is a lot farther trip but if your live frog faction is still ok<br/>
you can go real deep in there without a problem. From what I remember<br/>
the only thing that would agro on you is the &quot;Huge&quot; water elemental and<br/>
he&#39;s real deep. I just realized no one on the list has mentioned that<br/>
before. A level 12 bard could hang out in the mino maze all day begging<br/>
to loot a shin knight and never get a scratch.<br/>
