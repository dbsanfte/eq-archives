<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849319559">Ahh, Selos Accelerando is the greatest song.  I enjoy pulling my drum out, <br/>
pressing the auto-run key, and zipping from zone to zone.  There is <br/>
something extremely satisfying when overtaking other people who are running <br/>
along the same path as me, especially when they are druids.  Last night I <br/>
made a hotkey for just these circumstances.  Now whenever I slide by someone <br/>
who is running (but not as fast as I am, hehe) I say &quot;On your left!&quot; as I <br/>
pass them.  All you bike riders out there know what I&#39;m talking about here.<br/>
<br/>
I think this should become the universal bardic call throughout Norrath.  :P<br/>
