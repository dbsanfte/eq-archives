overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>
bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>
good percentage of their customers.<br/>

&gt;I think I stated pretty clearly in my original post that I&#39;m glad Verant is<br/>
&gt;giving the high level characters something to do.  This might keep you guys<br/>
&gt;busy until expansion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My points about neglecting 46- level characters is still valid however.<br/>
&gt;Since this game has been out, players have consistently begged Verant to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>add<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;more quality quests to the game.  With the exception of the class armor<br/>
&gt;quests, most of the other quests for low and medium level characters flat<br/>
&gt;out suck and aren&#39;t worth the time and effort.  Is it too much to expect<br/>
&gt;that as the game evolves over time, Verant will make improvements to all<br/>
&gt;aspects of the game?  You yourself stated the 50 level players are bored so<br/>
&gt;thats why they start twink characters.  It sure would be nice if those<br/>
&gt;twinks had something different to look forward to (new items and quests).<br/>
&gt;As it stands now, all they get to do is the stuff their 50th level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>character<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;has probably already done countless times over.  How boring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; One thing what do you think us 46+ players had to play with? Guess what<br/>
&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt; low levels are having a ton more fun then us high levles why do you think<br/>
&gt;&gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; many of us twink? They have to do something about high levels because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; are the most unhappy there are only two zones excluding planes that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; do sol b and guk. DO you have any clue how crowded it is? We were doing<br/>
&gt;&gt; bothg planes and both dragons at the same time on E&#39;ci and guess what<br/>
&gt;&gt; there<br/>
&gt;&gt; is still 80+ people in guk and sol b. This is a major problem and they<br/>
&gt;&gt; need<br/>
&gt;&gt; to fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just complaining<br/>
&gt;&gt; that they don&#39;t get anything new added. Perosnally I could care less if<br/>
&gt;&gt; they<br/>
&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t add anything new for me but I do care that it&#39;s crowded as hell<br/>
&gt;&gt; for<br/>
&gt;&gt; high levels.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;Someone posted a link on the new Concert Hall message board of the new<br/>
&gt;&gt; bard<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;quests on the PoA.  There are six bard quests and each quest requires<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;obtain three items to get the reward.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Abashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt;new patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;related to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new<br/>
&gt;&gt; items.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I only looked at the bard quests, but assuming all class quests require<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;three components, thats 252 quests components (84 x3).  Some of the<br/>

&gt;&gt; they<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;are dropped only in PoA or in other zones.  I assume the 200+ class<br/>
&gt;&gt; specific<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;items Abashi referred to were the 84 quest reward items and the 252+/-<br/>
&gt;&gt; quest<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;components.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Rant on:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to<br/>
&gt;&gt; do.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern<br/>
&gt;&gt; with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;With the exception of the class armor quests added a few months back and<br/>
&gt;&gt; new<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;loot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently<br/>
&gt;&gt; (past<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;few months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;aware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium<br/>
&gt;&gt; level<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;characters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me<br/>
&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Verant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;45- characters. Am I out of line thinking this way?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Caveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;usuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Its also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;high level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>
