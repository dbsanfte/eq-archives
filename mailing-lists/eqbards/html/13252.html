&gt; Now granted, I have been in groups with a 50 necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>

&gt; my pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>

&gt; one Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?  And Necros complain?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Much as people talk about Bind and Gate, I personally think that the pet spells <br/>
are the most ridiculously overpowered spells in the game (with the possible <br/>
exception of Group Mez).  I soloed my Enchantress to level 12 in less than 2 <br/>
days played by attacking whites and yellows, backing up to let the pet hit them, <br/>
then nuking them when they got low.  And Enchantress pets are the weakest in the <br/>
game.  While in the teens, I watched Necros of lower level than me soloing Dervs <br/>
that I couldn&#39;t take on a bet.  In the 20s, I watched a Wizard (who was blue to <br/>
me) soloing crocs in Oasis that were white and yellow to me, and killing them at <br/>
approximately twice the rate that I was killing blue caimans.  A pet cast by a <br/>
caster of equal rank to me melees better than I do.  So given that all of the <br/>
caster classes come with an easily created tank component that is better at <br/>
melee than I am, why am I a hybrid while they not?  Just asking.<br/>
