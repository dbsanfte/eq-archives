&gt;wall when pulling?  If you&#39;re headed back to your group, your front is to<br/>
&gt;them and your back is to the pullee.  What am I missing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not much *laughs*  I just meant keep your back to the wall while fighting,<br/>
while pulling  just try and keep a good head start and have your healer<br/>
target you before you go. :o)<br/>
