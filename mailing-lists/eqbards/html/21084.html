<div id="ygrps-yiv-578840631">Cool, now I can tell everyone at work I finally met someone who has seen an<br/>
item poof. We have somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 EQ&#39;ers here and I<br/>
just polled them to be sure it had not happened to them.  It hadn&#39;t, except<br/>
for one guy before they put in the Lore Item duplicate looting code.<br/>

I had 2 items poof on me.  Just do you know someone...<br/>
<br/>
Nothing of real consequence.  An ancient coin and a greater light stone...<br/>
