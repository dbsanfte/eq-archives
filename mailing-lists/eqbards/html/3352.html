&gt;I&#39;ve never seen one of these for sale.  Perhaps a trip to the area is in<br/>
&gt;order to hang around and see who has one weighing them down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any idea what one might cost?  I&#39;m flat broke and overweight from some<br/>
&gt;recent purchases of small bronze (thank Tunare I&#39;m a Wood Elf and can<br/>
&gt;wear the small stuff - the medium is going for twice as much...).<br/>
&gt;Would be nice to know how much cash to bring before I make the long run.<br/>

I have never seen one for sale, either, but I DID have a 37th level rogue<br/>
offer 100pp for mine, to which I said &quot;nada&quot;. The belt is not only NICE<br/>
because it is 4 AC, 5 STA, and 5 STR, and is Rogue/Bard only, but it also<br/>
LOOKS so cool in your inventory screen (Smile).<br/>
