<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028851169">Something strange must happen when one reaches level 20.  When I was that<br/>
level I met an old ogre friend who was level 29.  He offered to help me get<br/>
Elf Hide Gloves, by grouping with him and his fellow basher.  The three of<br/>
us: 29, 29, 20... and I got fairly good experience in Guk with them.<br/>

&gt;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>
&gt;(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>

&gt;you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just<br/>
