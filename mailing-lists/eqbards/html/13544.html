<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-260192578">Well, having spent this past weekend living in the new plane, I just<br/>
thought I&#39;d share some of my experiences.<br/>
<br/>
The plane is divided into 10 islands.  Travel from island to island is<br/>
done by either levitating (if you&#39;re coming from a sufficiently high<br/>
island) or through teleport devices.  The devices are all locked however,<br/>
and you need to get keys to get from island to island.  Other people have<br/>
covered the quests available in the plane, and this is mainly to give you<br/>
an idea of what to expect combat-wise.<br/>
<br/>
Island 1<br/>
Surprisingly enough, the island you start at is lowest in elevation, so no<br/>
floating to other islands from here.  The island consists of 6 fairies, 1<br/>
fairy princess, and a key master.  The key master sells two keys, the &quot;key<br/>
of swords&quot;, which costs 420 plat, is the route my post covers.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, in case you don&#39;t want to dish out 420 plat per person<br/>
going through, you can kill the fairies on the island, each of which drop<br/>
3 swords and 3 feet (the 3 feet are to obtain the other key).  After<br/>
killing all the fairies (or as many as to get the number of keys you<br/>
need), you need to kill the fairy princess (red cons to a level 50).  Upon<br/>
doing so, a halfing appears.  Do not hail him, doing so makes him poof.<br/>
Have everyone who had a sword from a fairy hand it to the halfing, and<br/>
they will receive a key of swords.  Use this key on the proper portal to<br/>
be transported to:<br/>
<br/>
Island 2<br/>
This island contains Noble Dojorn, as well as creatures called<br/>
bladestorms.  From here on out, the creatures have as many hit points and<br/>
hit just as hard (or harder) as your run-of-the-mill dragon (thankfully<br/>
minus the AE fear and damage).  None of this needs to be killed to reach<br/>
island 3 though, just levitate while sow&#39;d or speed song across a small<br/>
distance to (we&#39;ll come back to island 2 in a minute):<br/>
<br/>
Island 3<br/>
Island 3 is larger than the previous islands, with many different types of<br/>
creatures.  Watchful Guards (evil eye looking things), and A Gust of Wind<br/>
(air elementals) are among the 6 or 7 creature types on this island.  Each<br/>
creature drops an animal figuring along with whatever else might be found,<br/>
and each member of your party should get one of those, should they desire<br/>
to go further.  Killing the &quot;boss creature&quot; on the island, the Gorgalask<br/>
(sp?), causes the halfing to spawn again.  Turning in the figurine&#39;s<br/>
(again, don&#39;t hail him) will net you a &quot;key of beasts&quot; which will take you<br/>
to Island 4.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to what I skipped about Island 2.  Noble Dojorn is the first of 3<br/>
&quot;bosses&quot; for the plane.  He hits for over 300 and casts the same AE rain<br/>
spell that bladestorm does (3 ticks of 270+ damage).  As far as I could<br/>
tell, casters were more or less unable to hit him.  Bargash was present<br/>
for our slaying of Noble Dojorn, after which he chuckled and said &quot;The<br/>
overseer will dominate you.&quot; which takes us to:<br/>
<br/>
Island 4<br/>
There are two creatures besides Mr. Overseer on this island.  Essence<br/>
Harvesters and Soul Carriers.  Here is the breakdown on how the island<br/>
works:<br/>
<br/>
Essence Harvestors - Yellow, Indifferent con Pegasus. <br/>
<br/>
Soul Harvestors - Red, Scowls con Pegasus that pop 2 at a time when an<br/>
Essence Harvestor is killed. <br/>
<br/>
Soul Tamers - Red, Scowls con Pegasus that pop 1 at a time when you kill a<br/>
Soul Harvestor. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Soul Carriers - Yellow, Indifferent con Griffons. <br/>
<br/>
Essence Carriers - Red, Scowls con Griffons that spawn 2 at a time when<br/>
you kill a Soul Carrier. <br/>
<br/>
Essence Tamers - Red, Scowls con Griffons that spawn 1 at a time when you<br/>
kill an Essence Carrier. <br/>
<br/>
This means you pull 1 level 52 creature, kill it, cause 2 almost dragon<br/>
difficulty creatures to spawn, and those, in turn, when killed, cause yet<br/>
another dragon difficulty creature to spawn.  5 for 1, nice eh? :)<br/>
<br/>
So, does the Overseer dominate?  750 melee damage, 750 AE....  No, those<br/>
are not typos.  We decided not to try him just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Everything hits for 350-ish,  after this, I feel like I could clear<br/>
Freeport of Merchants. :)<br/>
