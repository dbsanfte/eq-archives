<div id="ygrps-yiv-409835846">&quot;Good god, how many songs are you twining!&quot;.  My reply (after the <br/>
battle) &quot;Too many to type!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe I must say, really brightened my evening to read that.  We were <br/>
helping with a corpse recovery somewhere in Sebilis (this was my <br/>
first time in that dungeon too).  Had 2 groups working together.  We <br/>
had been in several big battles already with multiple pulls each and <br/>
during this one we still had several more to go.  I think at the time <br/>
I had my Lute equipped.  The hotkey bank I had up had Verses, Nivs, <br/>
Hymn, Jig, and Clarity.  I guess she saw several of those flashing <br/>
icons on her screen and maybe I actually had a 4 song twist for a <br/>
second (Verses, Nivs, Hymn, Jig).  It&#39;s just nice to be recognized at <br/>
times. :)<br/>
