I&#39;m in the midst of trying to do a new quest that has been<br/>\nfound in Firiona Vie.  I was hoping that someone here could give me<br/>\nsome help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you hail Glinya Sweetpie (she sells baking items and food/water)<br/>\nshe mentions someone named Treekill.  If you ask her about him, she<br/>\nsays something to the effect of he&#39;s been tring to court her and she<br/>\ntold him to bring her a Burynai Bunt Cake to put him off.  Asking her<br/>\nabout the Bunt Cake, she says that there&#39;s no such thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a wandering guard named Scout Treekill.  If you hail him, he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t say anything, but the text mentions a helm hanging from his<br/>\nbelt.  If you ask him about the helm, he says that he took it from a<br/>\nbard he had to beat up because he was singing Drow songs.  (This has<br/>\nbeen mentioned on this list, I believe)  Asking him about Glinya<br/>\nSweetpie, He says that he&#39;s courting her and that she had asked him to<br/>\nbring her the bunt cake.  Asking him about the bunt cake gives you<br/>\nthis text (from my screenshot):<br/>\n<br/>\nScout Treekill gets excited.  What?!! Do you know how to bake a<br/>\nBurynai Bunt Cake.  Glinya said she would marry me if I baked one!!<br/>\nShe won&#39;t let me use her oven so I had to search for one.  I finally<br/>\nlocated one in some goblin mine, but I can&#39;t find the recipe or bake.<br/>\nPlease!! I would give you this bards helm for a Burynai Bunt Cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I have deduced from this passage.  The Bunt Cake requires<br/>\nthe baking skill.  There is an oven in the Mines of Droga where it<br/>\nmust be baked.  Now, I am not a baker, so I&#39;m asking here if anyone<br/>\nmight know the recipe for this?  Is there anyone else who might be<br/>\nworking on this that can give me any leads?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn Merrilin<br/>\nBard at Large on E&#39;ci<br/>\nCurrently: Level 41<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n72% off on Name brand Watches!<br/>\nCome and buy today and get free shipping!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958398059/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958398059/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
