Everyone starts out<br/>\nindifferent and moves from there. I don&#39;t know of anyway to improve faction<br/>\nwith them. My warrior is KOS to them and has kill hundreds of them, but I<br/>\nuse my brother&#39;s Enchanter and I keep him from going KOS so I can use the<br/>\nOtter merchant there on the beach. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience is average to above average. Loot is average. These beach<br/>\ndogs as I call them drop Crustacean Shell Armor. Bards would not want to use<br/>\nthis armor. Every piece of Crustacean Shell has  + Stamina and - Charisma.<br/>\nEach piece can sell for 500 - 2k. A lot of twinks like to use this armor for<br/>\nthe big Stamina boost. We also get a fair share of quest gems and spells<br/>\nfrom these beach dogs. As you stated Rebecca, the main reason my friend I<br/>\nhunt them is for their skins to help boost the Tailoring skill above 158. I<br/>\nknow on one 5 hour hunt there, my 5 member group made 350 platinum each by<br/>\nselling the junk gems and weapons, plus we each walked away with a couple<br/>\nquest gems each, 1-2 spells each and 2-3 pieces of Crustacean Shell Armor (<br/>\nsee stats below ) and a stack or 2 of skins.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Boots <br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 10 - Wt: 6.5 - Slot: feet<br/>\nAttributes: STR+6 DEX-2 STA+12 CHA-5 <br/>\nAverage Price: 2,200 (15 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Bracers <br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 9 - Wt: 4 - Slot: wrists<br/>\nAttributes: STR+5 STA+4 CHA-5 <br/>\nAverage Price: 900 (18 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Breastplate <br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 19 - Wt: 10 - Slot: chest<br/>\nAttributes: STR+5 STA+15 CHA-8 <br/>\nAverage Price: 1,600 (20 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Gauntlets<br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 11 - Wt: 5 - Slot: hands<br/>\nAttributes: STR+8 CHA-5 <br/>\nAverage Price: 3,700 (15 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Helm<br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 12 - Wt: 6 - Slot: head<br/>\nAttributes: STA+10 CHA-5 <br/>\nAverage Price: 1,500 (17 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Shield <br/>\nRaces: ALL - Classes: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD DRU BRD ROG SHM <br/>\nStats: AC: 17 - Wt: 5 - Slot: shield<br/>\nAttributes: STR+4 STA+10 CHA-7 <br/>\nAverage Price: 7,800 (29 entries) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Greaves <br/>\nRaces: HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF DWF TRL OGR HFL GNM - Classes: WAR CLR<br/>\nPAL SHD BRD (MAGIC)<br/>\nStats: AC: 12 - Wt: 7.5 - Slot: legs<br/>\nAttributes: STA+16 STR+4 CHA-5 DEX-4 <br/>\n<br/>\nCrustacean Shell Vambracers <br/>\nRaces: ALL - Classes: WAR CLR PAL SHD BRD <br/>\nStats: AC: 10 - Wt: 6.5 - Slot: Arm<br/>\nAttributes: STR+8 STA+12 DEX-4 CHA-4 <br/>\n<br/>\nFun little armor to use if you wanted a little Paladin or Shadow Knight<br/>\ntwink.

I have killed him twice. He is level 60<br/>\nand a total waste of time. Both times he dropped a cheesy 16 damage 46 delay<br/>\nspear. I don&#39;t think he is supposed to be killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one major draw back to killing these otters is if you do any trade skill<br/>\nbaking, 1 of the 2 merchants down on the beach sells cooking supplies (otter<br/>\nmilk, spices, garnish, oyster sauces, seaweed vinegar, plankton frosting ).<br/>\nThese cooking supplies are needed for some of the better stat food items and<br/>\nsome of the higher trivial skill levels. So, now my master cook warrior<br/>\nrelays on using my brother&#39;s enchanter to go his supplies from Bloogy<br/>\nShellcracker (otterman vendor). <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was so long, but I am very bored here at work, and it is Friday -<br/>\nI am ready to go home and play EQ :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Small said  &quot;Anyone know anything about killing the CS otters? Are<br/>\nthey on any faction<br/>\nwith dragons, giants, or dwarves? I need something to tailor above 158.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
