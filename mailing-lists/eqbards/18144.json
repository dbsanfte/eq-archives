There is a raft on the Oasis dock - it will take you to<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; Ogre Village in Timorous.  I believe these are the &quot;Broken Teeth&quot; Islands<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; the cloth map.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You will be taken to an Ogre village.  The Ogres I saw conned green to me<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; but there are probably a goodly number of them. I wasn&#39;t KOS - but I guy I<br/>\n&gt; eventually hooked up with was...  If you are working your way back - the<br/>\n&gt; loc<br/>\n&gt; is +7000 +3300<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I ended up finding the wrong dock - there is an &quot;Evil Boat&#39; That will take<br/>\n&gt; you to The Overthere.  This is a nasty zone.  It&#39;s an undead City.<br/>\n&gt; Everything Conned red to me - and to a 48(?) Paladin I hooked up with.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; boat &quot;Looks&quot; Evil so you&#39;ll know it if you see it.  We didn&#39;t get off the<br/>\n&gt; boat (one of the con&#39;ed red things was literally ON the dock).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We zoned back to that dock.  If I recall properly it was also an Ogre<br/>\n&gt; Village.  If my notes are correct the loc for this dock is neg 5000 neg<br/>\n&gt; 3700<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Through shouts we got the loc of the High-Elf village with the correct<br/>\n&gt; dock<br/>\n&gt; to Fironia Vie.  IF my notes are correct - (they are pretty cryptic at<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; point) the loc is neg 200 pos 3600. You shouldn&#39;t have probs getting exact<br/>\n&gt; loc from people who are making the return route as the boat stops there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We had to swim a lot to get there - but I&#39;m not sure whether this is true<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; you know where you&#39;re going from the Oasis Raft Dock.  I thought I heard<br/>\n&gt; someone say &quot;Go to South End of the Island&quot; which would imply no swimming<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; but perhaps it was &quot;Go to the South Island&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regardless - for me -  I explored the boat (IT&#39;S HUGE with spots yet<br/>\n&gt; unfilled for NPC&#39;s) I didn&#39;t realize that I ended up on the wrong side of<br/>\n&gt; the boat and had to make the circuit twice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; REMEMBER - DOCKS ON LEFT SIDE OF BOAT - so for this route - you stay on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; left side of the boat from the dock you got on at the High Elf Village to<br/>\n&gt; get off at Fironia Vie.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From when I left Oasis to when I actually got to Fironia Vie - 3 hours.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got bound - and then went the short way from the city to the tunnel that<br/>\n&gt; takes you to Dreadlands and hooked up with a pickup group.  There was a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; of confusion and problems with a Ranger who eventually got booted.  There<br/>\n&gt; was an excellent Bard - Ripkey (I don&#39;t think he was on the list) in the<br/>\n&gt; group however.  Among other annoying things - the Ranger kept telling us<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sing Heal During Combat&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But shortly there after - Several guildmates (led by Guild Leader 43 Level<br/>\n&gt; Druid who tp&#39;d to the Dreadlands) got on - and I wanted to hook up with<br/>\n&gt; them...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Wizards and Druids can TP to the Dreadlands.  This is a huge zone - I<br/>\n&gt; believe larger than anything pre-expansion.  Plenty of hunting grounds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure out how<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; Guild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.  Arkin died once...  Then we<br/>\n&gt; decided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back to<br/>\n&gt; Butcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The negative - on release day at least - no one had found the way from the<br/>\n&gt; TP spot to the zone Fironia Vie (the High-Elf City) - hopefully that will<br/>\n&gt; change soon.  The Guild group and I couldn&#39;t hook up until I did the<br/>\n&gt; painfully long boat trip to BB for pickup.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Butcherblock route.   Take the OTHER dock in Butcherblock from the<br/>\n&gt; Freeport boat.  There will be little shuttles - this will zone to Timorous<br/>\n&gt; Deep and connect to the Boat.  The boat is very large.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BUG REPORT - I went the opposite direction - so can&#39;t confirm it - But an<br/>\n&gt; EQ<br/>\n&gt; Vault they reported probs with Shuttle. Take the 1st on one route.  If<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; shuttle doesn&#39;t hook up with the loading dock on the side of the boat -<br/>\n&gt; jump<br/>\n&gt; off and climb up the rudder.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The shuttles connect with the right side of the boat.  Move to the left<br/>\n&gt; side.  There are a couple of stops in Timorous - this zone is the equiv.<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; OOT.  Don&#39;t get off here if you&#39;re going to Fironia Vie.  Eventually it<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; zone there and the dock on the left side.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did the return route - had just missed the boat in Firnonia.  Took about<br/>\n&gt; an hour (I&#39;m not kidding)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far I&#39;ve only seen 2 zones - and the Dreadlands at least are so big I<br/>\n&gt; doubt that crowding will be an issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online <br/>\n&gt; reservations.
