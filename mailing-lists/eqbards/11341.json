I&#39;ve seen the song work in the last 3 weeks<br/>\n&gt; several times effectively, so I&#39;m not able to pin down why it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; working for others. Sorry for the confusion, my intent was to point out<br/>\n&gt; the song has at least a two-fold use. I wouldn&#39;t solo a cleric that<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t green to me, and as such it doesn&#39;t really matter if he tries to<br/>\n&gt; hit me or not, so long as he can&#39;t cast. I often pull casters with<br/>\n&gt; debuff, so by the time he gets to me he&#39;s sans bravery, guard, o&#39;kiel&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; radiation, etc. anyways. ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just curious as to why you would use lullaby instead of pixie strike to<br/>\ninterrupt casters?  I have fantastic luck using strike for that purpose, but<br/>\noccasionally the timing will get off and I lose a bubble in a single cast, never<br/>\nfun.  Haven&#39;t tried lullaby for quite a while - have you tested both and found<br/>\nlullaby to be more useful?  Either way, guess I&#39;ll give it a try...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
