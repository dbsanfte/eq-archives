The bard song only affects party members <br/>\n&gt; within a certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; range of the bard.   We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a <br/>\n&gt; party member<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls <br/>\n&gt; behind the party.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Imagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again though, like most of the discussion on my post, this <br/>\n&gt; misses what I<br/>\n&gt; thought was my main point, which is that a bard song wearing <br/>\n&gt; off should<br/>\n&gt; not nullify an already in effect spell. That is what makes the bard<br/>\n&gt; song especially dangerous. You can&#39;t even use it for yourself when<br/>\n&gt; grouped or to help one person who the spell effect has worn off from,<br/>\n&gt; without risking negatively effecting other party members who happen to<br/>\n&gt; be in range. What makes it doubly dangerous is that the spell icon is<br/>\n&gt; still in place on their screen, so they may not notice that <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve lost<br/>\n&gt; the effect until it&#39;s too late.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your points however are equally valid. It&#39;s enough problem keeping a<br/>\n&gt; party together with Selo&#39;s, given that people theoretically run all at<br/>\n&gt; the same speed in this game, with the huge variation in swimming speed<br/>\n&gt; depending on skill it wouldnt be much use as the party&#39;s main resource<br/>\n&gt; for an underwater trip. But the cancellation effect makes it less than<br/>\n&gt; useful as a back up resource as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
