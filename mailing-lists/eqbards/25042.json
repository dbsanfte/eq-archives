Yeah, I know you can go out on the web<br/>\nand buy that stick of pc-100 128 mb of ram for 1/3 of what CompUSA or<br/>\nwhoever charges, but there is a reason for that...<br/>\nIf you are gonna get new memory, don&#39;t be cheap and go ahead and get<br/>\nKingston or VisionTek or such. Yeah, it&#39;ll cost you a bit more in the short<br/>\nterm, but it&#39;ll make you alot happier in the long run.  (Compaq and HP both<br/>\nuse Kingston, or used to, even though it&#39;s labeled as Compaq or HP).<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nFWIW, HP doesn&#39;t appear to be using Kingston anymore.  In fact their newer<br/>\nlaptops will crash if you try to put a Kingston chip in the first slot and<br/>\nan HP chip in the second.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d add to MacGrough&#39;s recommendation to get all the same name.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;ve already got, say, Compaq memory and just need another module, get<br/>\nanother Compaq even if another name brand is cheaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
