Surely after a few groups like this you might remember the few<br/>\nplayers who were ok? Next time you go, look for them and group with<br/>\nthem. At least that&#39;s how I did it. I ended up with my current group of<br/>\nplayers from talking to someone in a group I was in in Cazic who was the<br/>\nonly person in the group I found fun to play with. The rest were either<br/>\nhard core leveling freaks or greedy power looters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in bad groups, get out as fast as possible. Try to take the ones<br/>\nwith a clue with you. It takes time to weed through all the bad players<br/>\nyou meet until you find a bunch worth playing with but it&#39;s worth it<br/>\nlater. In fact I&#39;d go so far as to say if you don&#39;t do this it&#39;s a waste<br/>\nof time playing the game.
