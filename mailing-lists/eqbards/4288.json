He was running<br/>\naround kiting something in South Ro and he saw a small spider in front of<br/>\nhim that sorta looked like it was climbing over a distant hill. He thought<br/>\nto himself &#39;Damn, that perspective&#39;s messed up&#39;. Thinking it might have been<br/>\nsome squirrely beta display code he continued kiting and forgot about the<br/>\nspider. That is until he got the &#39;Terrorantula hits you for XX damage&#39; at<br/>\nwhich point he spun around and saw a leg, just a leg, on his screen. He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take the time to look up as he was quickly fleeing to the zone line.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Abraham Hardjana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Sunday, July 25, 1999 2:22 AM<br/>\n8)To: EQBards<br/>\n8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Why me?<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)On Sat, 24 Jul 1999, Michal Hobson wrote:<br/>\n8)&gt; P.S.
