He has to<br/>\nbe high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53.  Off the top<br/>\nof my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to get EXP when<br/>\ngrouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at least in your<br/>\n40s.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would be X/X+53.<br/>\nThis is the base EXP amount you receive.  The group bonus, class bonus, and<br/>\nzone bonus get added to the base value to determine total EXP received per<br/>\nkill.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the new system, lower level characters get a higher % split of EXP<br/>\nwhen grouping with higher level character than they did under the old<br/>\nsystem.  I have actually been in a group that did not want to add someone<br/>\nlower level because the person would steal EXP from them.  This person was<br/>\nprobably one of those that didn&#39;t want to group with hybrids prior to the<br/>\nnew system for the same stupid reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris.holden@...\">chris.holden@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris.holden@...\">chris.holden@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 23, 2001 7:31 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Question on &quot;Drafting&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>\nregular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on<br/>\nxp<br/>\nwhile I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>\nattempt<br/>\nto play for the first month).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>\nlevel<br/>\nplayer in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>\nand<br/>\ngroup. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot;<br/>\nor<br/>\nride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>\nlevel<br/>\nwould get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>\nhave played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>\n30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ranian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
