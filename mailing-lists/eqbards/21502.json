That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the <br/>\nhell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually <br/>\nforces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play <br/>\nCelerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case <br/>\nyou missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades <br/>\nworth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just <br/>\nadds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me <br/>\nre-evaluate my line up.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, jhenders@b... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; It is nice to see it&#39;s got buy in from those that like to watch <br/>\nmovies<br/>\n&gt; while playing the mana song though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Sep 20/00, &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; <br/>\n&lt;garramone@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I couldn&#39;t agree less =b<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Goodness, people bitch way too much about VI.
