I was level 18 (19 ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-87084558\">Greetings again!<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer here to offer &#39;is two copper&#39;s worth on this long subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I came by Zarhan&#39;s Coronet!  I was level 18 (19 <br/>\nnow..hurrah!!) and I looked at the stats and found I could not equip this <br/>\nitem.  So...I offered it to the party.  They laughed their butts off!  They <br/>\nsaid why would I want to give away for free an item that sells for 500pp?  <br/>\nWhat?!?  I can get this kind of money for it?  Wow! Well, can anybody use it <br/>\nor not?  They say no.  So I tell guild.  They say to sell it.  So I auction <br/>\nit....but I am reasonable.  I state in my auction the worth of this item and <br/>\nthen say I will take far less for a deserving person.  A level 30 shaman <br/>\nanswers that he would like to buy the item.  So I sold it for 300pp.  Am I <br/>\nbad?  I was in leather up to level 14.  Now I have bronze and banded.  I had <br/>\na fs long sword and a fs scimitar (which I lost on a looting bug).  Now I <br/>\nhave a dragoon dirk and a combine long sword.  I have plenty of cash in the <br/>\nbank now too.  So....was I wrong to sell?  No!  I have played the game to <br/>\nthe hilt.  I couldn&#39;t equip the item.  Somebody else has wanted it for a <br/>\nlong time and could afford the price I asked.  Did they cheat?  No!  So I <br/>\nguess I am saying that if a person hits the lottery jackpot, they should be <br/>\nable to enjoy it. I think we have several people here on the list who agree <br/>\nwith this in part or in whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne point I would like to make is that an experienced person has stated that <br/>\nselling an item you can use may not be wise since you will probably want it <br/>\nlater.  I think we are confusing two issues here.  To sell or keep being one <br/>\nissue.  To have alot of money at a realatively low level being another.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst may I address keeping valuable items?  Ok...if I had that crown I <br/>\nwould keep it.  I don&#39;t really need it, but I don&#39;t really need the money <br/>\neither.  So I would keep it.  If I came across a money crunch though, I <br/>\nwould sell stuff to get what I want.  I have a cleric friend that literally <br/>\nsold all his armour (when we were in low teens) to buy spells.  Was that <br/>\nwise?  Got me.  But he had his spells which made the party stronger.  And he <br/>\nhad our sympathy so we made sure that all armour loots went to him.  Plus we <br/>\nbought auctioned gear we could afford.  If you solo though....choose well!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond let&#39;s visit having bnch of money at low level.  There are rich <br/>\nfamilies in the real world.  These families have kids that drive cars I <br/>\ndream about.  Am I jealous?  Hell yeah!  A 16 year old kid in a brand new <br/>\nCorvette is always sure to set my teeth on edge.  That is life.  Some people <br/>\nwill always have more/better stuff.  If i was a multi-bizzillionaire I would <br/>\nbuy family nice stuff too.  So in a virtual world if I see a level one guy <br/>\nrunning around with a full bronze plate and a deadly weapon running for the <br/>\nguards to hide from two firebeetles I laugh.  To me it is like a rich kid.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s not better than me, he has better stuff.  He doesn&#39;t bother me a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last point to make.  One person mentioned that a character that was <br/>\noutfitted well had little reason to fulfill quests that provided items of <br/>\nless value than currently equiped.  Also along this line of thought it was <br/>\nstated that a character may not get the full value out of the game because <br/>\none needn&#39;t go to all of the apropriate areas for the level (Crushbone, <br/>\nOasis, etc.)and wouldn&#39;t be able to relate to others tactics on handling <br/>\nthese places.  Hmmm.  There&#39;s much to say on this, but want to try to keep <br/>\nit short and to a point.   I haven&#39;t been to all the places &quot;appropriate to <br/>\nmy level&quot; with my Bard.  I have been to some, and linger in ones I like.  <br/>\nAlso the places are far apart.  My real world time is precious, and running <br/>\nhalfway across the world (or farther) just to see if I may like a place or <br/>\nnot is not a practical thought.  If I like a place, get good exp, have <br/>\nfriends in the area (through grouping with different groups), then why <br/>\nshould I leave?  Am I missing the &quot;full value&quot; of the game?  I think not.  I <br/>\ncan start a character someday closer to places my Bard hasn&#39;t visited.  I <br/>\nWILL see everything, eventually.  One thing to keep in mind is that we all <br/>\nhave a different idea of getting the most out of EQ.  I am social.  If my <br/>\nparty wants to move, we move.  I don&#39;t say &quot;I am outta here!  One more level <br/>\nand I won&#39;t enjoy Crushbone anymore!&quot;  That would be unfair to the party.  <br/>\nTo sum up this little tirade, this is a subjective issue.  I have seen high <br/>\nevel people in Crushbone, trying to complete a quest for lower levels.  Are <br/>\nthey annoying low level people?  Oh yeah!  Why are they there?  To complete <br/>\na quest that is fun and challenging to figure out.  If I start out in <br/>\nQeynos, with a monk, I would level up a good bit before trying to cross some <br/>\nhard zones to get to Freeport.  Then I would work my way to Kelethin.  By <br/>\nthe time I got to Crushbone I would probably too powerful for it.  But I <br/>\nwould go anyway if I heard there was a good quest there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk!  I lied!  I told you 2 copper&#39;s worth and then gave you a gold piece!  <br/>\nThese are just some of my thoughts on the subjects.  I don&#39;t want us to <br/>\nargue over subjective things like value of items and value of game play.  I <br/>\nlike debate.  I know that I am basically supporting a side on this topic, <br/>\nbut I hope any opposing view points don&#39;t take offense!  I used examples to <br/>\naddress them not to attack the person who originated.  I believe we all <br/>\nreally like being Bards, and I believe that we are all decent people!  We <br/>\nshould get along just fine!<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewdeur,19th level Bard,enjoying Cazic-Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I expect some rebuttals!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;OK. Let me start off by saying I too dislike twinking. That said, THE <br/>\n&gt;CHARACTER<br/>\n&gt;IN QUESTION GOT THE ITEM WITHIN THE RULES OF THE GAME BY DOING A QUEST! How <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;that a twink? He got the item fair and square so shouldn&#39;t it be his to do <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;as he wishes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jeez people, crawl down off your soapbox once in a while.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Taelin, Songweavers of Kelethin, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: DreamKing &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmking@...\">drmking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I totally agree with you. It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked <br/>\n&gt;players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing <br/>\n&gt;out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with <br/>\n&gt;pieces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most out of EQ.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
