SolA is mostly<br/>\nfarming, with a close bind you&#39;d actually see some activity there since it<br/>\nreally can be a good group zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; South Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines<br/>\n </span></blockquote>away.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>\n&gt; normally nobody in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard a few mentions of the Stone bridge in NK to support the Karana<br/>\narea, only problem with that is a lot of races aren&#39;t on good terms with the<br/>\nQeynos guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron = No - Gfay and Kaladim are both close.  Kedge would<br/>\n&gt; probably get a small xp modifier boost, and Unrest an even larger one, to<br/>\n&gt; entice the lower levels to try, who have a harder time travelling Dagnors.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are right, the other zones are close enough. If given a choice I go with<br/>\nKaladim, it&#39;s a little further but sometimes GFay is lagfest. Kedge, I love<br/>\nthat place and a higher xp mod would be great (it&#39;s 3rd now not counting<br/>\nVelious) but they really need to reitimize it, add a few rare random drops<br/>\nand the zone will be popular again. Distance from a bind point has never<br/>\nslowed down Kedge activity, it&#39;s a zone that has a huge xp mod but no loot<br/>\nto speak of usually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OOT = Unk - Could go either way.  Due to only being able to zone by boat,<br/>\n&gt; the arguments are strong in either case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On Seafury Island there&#39;s a druid ring, make it an active port. The zone is<br/>\njust a pain in the neck to get into. Binds in the zone would make things<br/>\neasier but I&#39;m not sure it will increase the use of the zone. They have<br/>\nproved they can limit binds to a section of a zone with FV and OT, put a<br/>\ngypsy camp (on betaneutral faction) in these zones and you can only bind<br/>\nthere within that camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>\n&gt; pathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>\n&gt; xp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; faults.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reitemize I&#39;m betting and fixing some pathing, even with some of the more<br/>\ninteresting new additions (DEs, corrupt brownies) it&#39;s still passable for<br/>\npeople wanting to hunt in Mistmore. As a zone itself, very underused but<br/>\nthose new camps is the reason, I had a character who was working the orc<br/>\ncamps at one point and I gave up after a DE pathed back through us after<br/>\nchasing down and killing someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Innothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>\n&gt; midpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>type,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>\n&gt; zones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>\n&gt; proximity to Lguk.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same as OOT, place a small circle of NPCs on betaneutral faction. Lower Guk<br/>\nisn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s upper guk which is probably underhunted. Lower is<br/>\nstill active because there&#39;s still some good stuff there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Everfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>\n&gt; aligned folks can bind in Halas.  Fixing Permafrost will also help,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>though.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; :)  Might as well be named Permatrain, as it is now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Random item drops in Perma would make it Very interesting. Bad pathing and<br/>\nwarping going away would be great but if there&#39;s some decent loot people<br/>\nwill put up with those problems. Also if the zone scaled up a little better<br/>\nit would help, I think in the upper 20s it starts to green out and at that<br/>\nlevel you can&#39;t break the king room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kunark and Velious - I just don&#39;t have enough knowledge of these zones.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kunark is limited to FV and LOIO, with some FM thrown in, and my Velious<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; limited to Frankel the Pirate in N Ro.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Change the EJ port from an evac to a regular port as well as an evac. That<br/>\nalone will open up most of the rest of the zones. Right now if you want to<br/>\ngo to CoM from East Commons, you get a port to DL, then run to Karnor&#39;s and<br/>\nevac to EJ. 30-45 minutes under the best conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderbrush<br/>\nLevel 1 pathfinder, knight of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nReedwind<br/>\n19th level bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
