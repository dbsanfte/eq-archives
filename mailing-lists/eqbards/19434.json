The question is will Verant do anything about it on<br/>\na consistent basis?  I remember right before Kunark came out there was an<br/>\nevent in Mistmoore where Mayong was controlled by a GM.  The entire event<br/>\nwas strictly text based, i.e. the GM was telling a story, an elven slave was<br/>\ntortured etc.  They weren&#39;t killing everyone in the zone.  Some level 50s<br/>\nzoned in and started attacking Mayong while the GM was still telling the<br/>\nstory.  So what happened?  The GM teleported them all to Tox forest to get<br/>\nthem out of the zone.  This is how every GM event should be run.  Players<br/>\nshould get some kind of warning we they enter the zone that the event is<br/>\ngeared towards a certain level range and any player higher than that is not<br/>\nallowed to participate.  They can watch but not attack or assist.  If they<br/>\ndon&#39;t play by the rules they get teleported out of the zone.  Verant did it<br/>\nwith the Mayong event so that means they can do it with others if they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBuy and sell used, rare and vintage gear at the Web&#39;s best<br/>\nmusic gear auction.
