We had a a Ranger AND a druid in our original group,<br/>\nbut the Druid is 32 (to our 18) now and the Ranger has not played in two<br/>\nmonths...  With the two potential people coming in, I told them to make<br/>\nthe character they want, not what we need.  Given the choice, I think i<br/>\nwanted a druid and another tank to fill out the group (still no<br/>\nenchanter, but we can make do with the bard)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my experience, the darkness line is inferior to snare.<br/>\n&gt; Stuff with darkness on it will start to run *before* the<br/>\n&gt; darkness will halt their movement.  So they&#39;ll still manage to<br/>\n&gt; flee a bit depending on how quickly you&#39;re damaging it.<br/>\n&gt; Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>\n&gt; thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>\n&gt; hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>\n&gt; runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
