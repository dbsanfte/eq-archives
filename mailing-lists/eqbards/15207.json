INT affects your chance at skill<br/>\nincreases, so it&#39;s easiest for enchanters (and wizards, mages,<br/>\nnecros) to max their jewelcraft skill.  But WIS affects your<br/>\nchance to succeed.  Couple that with the success rate for the<br/>\ntop end items being piss-poor even at 200 skill, and clerics<br/>\nend up being the best jewelers.  If you became a jeweler with<br/>\nthe intent of making money on these high end items, and you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have near-200 WIS, there&#39;s just no way to financially<br/>\ncompete.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
