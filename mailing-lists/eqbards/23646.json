We got there and it actually wasn┬Æt pre-occupied┬à Shortly<br/>\nafter we got there ┬û a contingent from one of the largest guilds on the<br/>\nserver showed up ┬û saying they had a Warrior who just needed the Maestro<br/>\nHand for his epic ┬û (Maestro WAS up) and asked to stay and only loot that ┬û<br/>\nand not to participate in any other lottos.  We agreed┬à<br/>\n<br/>\n            We cleared all the mobs between SWC and the Maestro.  I do<br/>\nbelieve he came unexpected at our first attempt.  Things were going pretty<br/>\ngood ┬û until he gravity fluxes some tanks ┬û who get stuck in the ceiling.<br/>\nThe Maestro proceeds to follow the tanks up and get stuck himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Clerics start to camp ┬û Maestro comes back down; a bit of<br/>\nconfusion follows ┬û some people are yelling at the clerics to cancel<br/>\ncamping ┬û others not ┬û I end up getting killed.  Not sure if we can take him<br/>\nor not ┬û probably was best to keep camping; as several tanks and several<br/>\ncorpses are stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Fortunately the GM/Guides were having a party (year anniversery<br/>\nof a Guide) and there were so many online the /who all gm list got cut off.<br/>\nI┬Æve never seen a petition answered by 2 GM┬Æs in like 15 seconds!  We get<br/>\nthe corpses and peoples unstuck ┬û and rezzed and setup again.<br/>\n<br/>\n            We had to clear several mobs ┬û but then get him when he┬Æs<br/>\nready ┬û I had my resists songs up ┬û didn┬Æt save the Chanter from Melee<br/>\ndamage  - but the Gravity Fluxes and Life Drains were all resisted.  We took<br/>\nhim down with only 2 deaths.<br/>\n<br/>\n            They go to loot him ┬û sadly for the Warrior ┬û no Hand; but he<br/>\nhad 2 count em 2 Seven String Lutes!  I was the only bard on the Raid.  I<br/>\ngave Darkfox a tell ┬û and there was some talk between us of trying to get<br/>\nhim before it rotted but stupid me ┬û in all the zone spam I missed some Mage<br/>\nasking if she could loot the lute for her ┬ôcollection┬ö.  Not clear whether<br/>\nDarkfox could have gotten up in time though.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Anyway ┬û this is my first piece of planes gear.  This was my<br/>\nfifth trip to Hate ┬û and on the first an Imbrued Bracer dropped but I lost<br/>\nthe lotto.  Sure would be nice to get out of my blue pants and helmet (and<br/>\nupgrade my Guardian BP)┬à<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n53rd Bard of Xegony<br/>\nOrder of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
