The perception<br/>\nthing may cover the first case, and the two may not be connected, but I<br/>\nthought I would include it incase it inspires any new info.<br/>\n<br/>\n============================<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are instances where the client will say you have spirit of wolf<br/>\nup...but you aren&#39;t moving any faster. I have noticed this a few times but<br/>\nhave been unable to discover the exact reason or pattern as to how and why<br/>\nthis occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one bug I can verify and duplicate is one where you don&#39;t have the<br/>\nspirit of wolf icon up but you are definitely SoWed. It will not wear off<br/>\nuntil you zone or die. The catch is to get this way you first have to die.<br/>\nRather expensive and inconvenient if you ask me. You&#39;re better off getting<br/>\nsome Journeyman Boots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being the client/server have trouble sometimes correctly keeping<br/>\ntrack of what your movement speed should be. Nice if you get the perma SoW<br/>\nbut it sucks arse if you get the opposite.<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
