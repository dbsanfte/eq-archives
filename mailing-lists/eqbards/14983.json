Just joined the list today, and I happened to notice a thread that I d posted on at the Concert Hall Website (http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1349357142\">Greetings.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust joined the list today, and I happened to notice a thread that I&#39;d<br/>\nposted on at the Concert Hall Website<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/)\">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/)</a> regarding weapon effectivness.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I learned here came from the SK Website over at EQStractics, but I<br/>\ndecided to apply it to bards because it made sense (To my limited<br/>\nknowledge that is)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up what they had learned:<br/>\nThe hit you make the most often, the mode, (thank you Kaearia) is<br/>\nconsidered tha &#39;Magic Number&#39; (MN).  This number over a large enough<br/>\nsample size shows up to be 20% (Approx) higher than any other damage<br/>\namt.  The way to figure out this MN is a set formula which we&#39;re all<br/>\nfamiliar with (possibly)<br/>\n<br/>\n      MN = (wep dmg * 2) + ((lvl - 25)/3)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part (wep dmg * 2) determines the base dmg caused by the<br/>\nweapon, the second part ((lvl - 25)/3) is the bonus you get as you<br/>\nprogress up levels.  At lvl 50, you get a +8 bonus (Always round down.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.. now you know what the dmg you can cause in one swing on average is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take this number and divide it by the delay of the weapon, you<br/>\nnow have an effective way to compare the weapons between levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n    MN = (wep dmg * 2) + ((lvl - 25)/3)/dly<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you look at this on a spreadsheet, it makes some really interesing<br/>\nfacts come to life, such as:<br/>\nCompare Bladed Thulian Claws to a Silvery War Axe at both Lvl 25 and<br/>\nthen at 50.<br/>\n                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>\nThulian Claws      37          18<br/>\nSilvery War Axe    34          24<br/>\n<br/>\nOr take the Mithrill Quill compared to a Obsidian Shard<br/>\n                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>\nMith Quill         88          36<br/>\nObsidian Shard     54          42<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, one of the most shocking IMHO.<br/>\n                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>\nSS o Ykesha        17          17<br/>\nShark Tooth        31          14<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone cares to take a look at the spreadsheet for themselves feel<br/>\nfree.  The website where you can find it is at<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rnoble001/EQ_BardWepData.html\">http://www.geocities.com/rnoble001/EQ_BardWepData.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA few disclaimers first though...<br/>\n*  This formula is only valid for characters over lvl 25, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nthe formula for characters under 25<br/>\n*  Proc&#39;s are -NOT- factored in in any way shap manner or form.  I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to figure out a way that I can.<br/>\n*  The format for the spreadsheet is Excel 97<br/>\n*  There are a bunch of blanks.  If you could all help me fill it it,<br/>\nit&#39;d be appreciated. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoy what I created, and I hope you are able to put it to good<br/>\nuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Banyon, wandering minstral of 15 songs.<br/>\n    ~Bertox~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
