It","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2061994193\">When I was grouping with a druid who I often group with, he asked me to<br/>\nkeep track of the damage his shield was doing (so he could figure out<br/>\nit&#39;s worth).  It was pretty amazing, averaged well more than 2.5 damage<br/>\nto mana.  And this was in a less than ideal damage shield situation. <br/>\n(there were 2 tanks, plus me, so three people who were taking damage)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the right situations they are firghteningly effiecient.  If you have<br/>\na single tank character who is taking most of the damage, or a place<br/>\nwhere you pull lots of crappy greens (like unrest), those damage shields<br/>\ndo scary amounts of damage.  If you are in a &quot;distribute the damage&quot; or<br/>\na burn and med group they are not so good...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it seems to me that the damage from the shield gets credited to<br/>\nthe tank (for hate list purposes).  If thats true, its a very good<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
