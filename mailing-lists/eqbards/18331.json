I actually had 8<br/>\ncharm resists (long enough for our cleric to die) in a row before the<br/>\nlevel 51 bard in our party charmed the Spectral Knight for the first<br/>\ntime.  After her charm broke, she charmed it again and when that broke<br/>\nI was able to take control of it and sit it by the castle as we moved<br/>\nto zone.  After that she charmed it 3 or 4 more times while people<br/>\nmade their way to zone and then I charmed it once as she made her way<br/>\nout this time with no resist.  Definately a con yellow at level 50<br/>\ntoo, and the other bard said it conned white to her at level 51.  I<br/>\ngot summoned by the Knight first and then the cleric second, probably<br/>\nfrom healing me which was his death sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level 51 bard barely got resisted by the Knight where as I started<br/>\nwith 8 in a row (I almost never get resisted...).  Don&#39;t know for sure<br/>\nif the resists were level dependent or if it was because of the<br/>\ninfamous Verant semi-random number generator.<br/>\n<br/>\n [part of message clipped]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
