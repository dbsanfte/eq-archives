I.e. is it considered cheating? If <br/>\n&gt;it is, I definitely want to know about it now.<br/>\n&gt;A: Twisting is not cheating. It won&#39;t be coded against. We are even looking<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;at putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower <br/>\n&gt;machines twist better, while not allowing those with faster machines to <br/>\n&gt;twist more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Me: This could be very interesting.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kit: This means it will break for all bards with high speed connections,<br/>\ncount on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Q: If any instruments raise song effectiveness, can you please have that <br/>\n&gt;listed when we examine it?<br/>\n&gt;A: Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;that type of song can be increased by an instrument (example: Any set of <br/>\n&gt;Drums will make you run faster when playing Selo&#39;s Accelerando). Some <br/>\n&gt;instruments will increase your effect more then others.

This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but I was wondering<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;what are the best buffs for a bard? For example, I recently discovered ... <br/>\n&gt;that dexterity helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs that a wise <br/>\n&gt;bard should be asking for?<br/>\n&gt;A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs. Most Bards that I know can <br/>\n&gt;also always use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts <br/>\n&gt;them dangerously close to encumbrance. AC & HP buffs are also nice - most <br/>\n&gt;denizens of Norrath have an inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;out on nearby minstrels.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Me: **Warning Sarcasm Alert** I do not think the hatred of muscian&#39;s in <br/>\n&gt;Norrath is limited to the Mobs....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kit: that&#39;s an understatement.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\nSonorous Clouding does not grant see Invisible to the party.  However, in<br/>\nthe limited testing I did last night, which really only consisted of running<br/>\ninvisible through Nek Forest with a partner, everything could see us if it<br/>\ngot into what would be a close party range.  Maybe the song now provides -<br/>\nNon-group See Invisible.  That sounds like a useful and well tested<br/>\nenhancement.  How can anyone support Verant&#39;s claim that they test changes,<br/>\nand more specifically that they test bards after yet another example of a<br/>\nchange that takes 30 seconds to test not working???<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading the patch message, logging in and running thru Nek without<br/>\nbeing able to see my companion, who laughed and said I told you so in<br/>\nresponse to my disgust at the change not working, I was pretty peeved.  The<br/>\n15 tells I got in the next 15 minutes from people asking how I liked the new<br/>\n&quot;See Visible&quot; enhancement from non-bard guildmates was the last straw.  I<br/>\ncamped and went and played AC.  It wasn&#39;t much fun, but it was more fun than<br/>\nbeing lied to and having it rubbed in my face again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nPS   /ignore Steelwolf (Ain&#39;t Outlook mail rules great?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
