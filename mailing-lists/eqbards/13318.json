In Cazic, you have the pathing bug we have been<br/>\ndiscussing that works in the players favor.  On the opposite end of the<br/>\nspectrum you have Mistmoore.  In Mistmoore, there are numerous pathing bugs<br/>\nthat work against the player.  One wrong move in the castle and you can pull<br/>\nevery mob inside.  If you cast an AE spell/song near the zone border you can<br/>\naggro stuff in the castle and they will nuke you from behind the wall.  In<br/>\nthe case of Cazic, you can get banned for exploiting a pathing bug.  In the<br/>\ncase of Mistmoore, mobs exploit pathing bugs to the players detriment but no<br/>\nway will you ever get EXP reimbursed if you die this way.  Now both of these<br/>\nsituations are avoidable if the player knows about them but how many people<br/>\ndoes that apply to?  I would venture to say that the vast majority of people<br/>\nwho play EQ, for whatever eason, do not subscribe to a mailing list like<br/>\nthis or read websites like EQVault.  As a result, they are unaware of issues<br/>\nlike pathing bugs that have a major impact on the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSidebar: Case in point about the mailing lists and websites comment.  I was<br/>\ngrouped with another bard the other night.  I was using Chains against<br/>\ngreater dark bones in Unrest.  GDBs never run away so you dont have to use<br/>\nensnare/chains on them for that purpose.  He asked me after the fight why I<br/>\nwas wasting my time singing Chains when GDBs never ran.  I told him that<br/>\nChains also slowed down a mobs attack speed.  He told me that I was flat out<br/>\nwrong and that the only thing Chains did was stop mobs from fleeing.  I told<br/>\nhim to believe what he wanted but if he wanted to confirm it for himself he<br/>\ncould subscribe to this list or check out Rokenn&#39;s website.  He told me he<br/>\nhad never heard of either site.  I&#39;ve had numerous conversations like this<br/>\nwith other bards on E&#39;ci I have grouped with (but not the ones on this<br/>\nlist).  I&#39;m sure it applies to every other class as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the pathing bug issue.  I haven&#39;t seen anything from Verant in a<br/>\nlong time addressing the pathing bug issue.  A few weeks ago on EQVault<br/>\nthere was a poll asking what areas of the game you wanted Verant to focus on<br/>\nfixing.  Off the top of my head, I think the possible answers were a) fix<br/>\nexisting known bugs 2) add more quests 3) class balance, 4) overcrowding.  I<br/>\nthink I left a few off but IIRC fixing existing known bugs was the #1<br/>\nresponse.  Seems to me though that fixing known bugs (and pathing AI is a<br/>\nbig one) doesn&#39;t seem to be a very big priority.  When I get the time, I&#39;ll<br/>\npost a message on the official EQ message board and bring this issue up<br/>\nagain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From how you describe the situation, I would guess that you were<br/>\n&gt; unknowingly<br/>\n&gt; using an exploit.  I imagine the other Bard was one of the one&#39;s on the<br/>\n&gt; steps?  (I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it an exploit, tho, since I believe the<br/>\n&gt; word<br/>\n&gt; &quot;exploit&quot; implies &quot;intent&quot; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that Verant can&#39;t fix this pathing bug, even though<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; known of it for a long time now.  It does make it impossible to fight in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; temple if attacked without exploiting unless every member of your group<br/>\n&gt; stands within melee range.  Obviously this is impractical.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; camped with a group in the halls for this reason alone.  Pulling to the<br/>\n&gt; bottom or pulling to the top seem to be the only ways around this.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; players who knowingly camp the halls and abuse the bug that bother me.  1<br/>\n&gt; wizard and 1 mage (w/o pet) standing in the corner nuking a mob standing<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; the stairs are definately &quot;knowingly&quot; using the exploit.  3 tanks engaging<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; mob in the hallway and 1 cleric standing behind are technically exploiting<br/>\n&gt; in that the cleric could never possibly be attacked, but may not be<br/>\n&gt; knowingly abusing the bug.  While they might wonder why the cleric is not<br/>\n&gt; getting attacked, if it was their first time there, they would really have<br/>\n&gt; no way of knowing.  This is the reason I jumped in this thread in the<br/>\n&gt; first<br/>\n&gt; place.  To educate anyone who did not know of this bug, so they would know<br/>\n&gt; what they were doing if and when the situation came up.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
