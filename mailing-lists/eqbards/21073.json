The code was<br/>\n&gt; usually too big and important to get management approval to spend a<br/>\n&gt; significant amount of time just rewrite the sucker.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;d try to make changes around it as much as possible to get anything<br/>\n&gt; done - but from time to time - you just had no choice to open up the hood<br/>\n&gt; and muck around there.  After you did - often you&#39;d find you created a few<br/>\n&gt; new problems despite your best efforts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes we&#39;d be able to convince the users to live with the new quirks<br/>\n&gt; because the end result was still much better than what we started out<br/>\nwith -<br/>\n&gt; and they had other stuff they wanted us to work on.  You&#39;d always hope for<br/>\n&gt; that big project that would have the budget to sneak in the time to<br/>\nre-write<br/>\n&gt; it even if wasn&#39;t necessary to get that project done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now we&#39;ve seen tons of cool new stuff come in with the client.  New colors<br/>\n&gt; for example.  Shoot, the turnaround from when someone suggested the LFG<br/>\nflag<br/>\n&gt; to implementation seemed like two weeks.  I&#39;m guessing the &quot;chat shell&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;who&#39;s online&quot; etc is simple and nicely written.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure seems to be lots of signs that the Spell System is one nasty goop of<br/>\n&gt; poorly written, implemented, and tested bit of nastiness...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
