Anyone else notice that invisio<br/>\nseems to fail EVERY time you get near it (Atleast it did when I was 23 havent<br/>\ntried at 24 yet)?<br/>\nWell I was in one group who camped the king room for some time and it was not<br/>\ntough to hold for a group of level 23-30 or so people with the right pulling<br/>\nstrategi.<br/>\nWhen I get the icy&#39;s I will be of to MM again to try and get the gloves and<br/>\nlute. Or maybe the karanas to get a griffene charm.<br/>\nSo dont give up. You can get the stuff with a bit of help. Just give yourself<br/>\ntime to get to know the zones where the items is - and how to get there.<br/>\nUsing your invisio song you can go far in on your own to get the loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, 24th verse Bertox.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 1<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 9 Nov 1999 11:25:46 +0000<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: AC Dilemma<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to get my Lambent armor but had no luck.
