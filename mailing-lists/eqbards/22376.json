I make song sets that either use a single instrument, or are voice-only, and<br/>\nuse an instrument or weapons depending.  I&#39;ll switch during a fight if I have to go to an alternate subset<br/>\n(e..g., I&#39;m switching from resists to charms, or weapons to resists), but otherwise forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn large group efforts, I&#39;m twisting songs as much as 2 song messages ahead, and my mouse cursor is close<br/>\nto unusable.  I&#39;ve done swapping in small group efforts where we needed every possible advantage, but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot sustainable.  I do it less than 1% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would bet that 95% of all high level bards don&#39;t swap or very rarely swap.  Heck, I had a level 56<br/>\nRanger in my group the other night who said to me &quot;wow, you&#39;re twisting songs!&quot;.  Apparently most of the<br/>\nBards he groups with don&#39;t even sing more than one thing!  So don&#39;t feel pressured to be compulsive about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty much able to keep 4 song effects up now (5 if I use the Breath of Harmony effect as one of<br/>\nthem).  I&#39;m certain that I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep the rhythm going well enough to use this many if I<br/>\nswapped, also.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, November 13, 2000 7:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Twisting Questions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main is a bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there... &quot;less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking more twisting!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to four songs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you all actually do this?
