If you fight them<br/>\nout on the deck - you are fine.  Usually the puller would get just a bit<br/>\ndown the catwalk and the birdie would be at he very top.  All others in the<br/>\nparty are forced to be out on the deck and the birdies on the roost don&#39;t<br/>\nagro. <br/>\n<br/>\nHehe, the 3 avo spawns - wait til you see one of those!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s morons who come in while you are fighting and pull the room on top of<br/>\nyou that will give you more trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, December 10, 1999 1:06 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Question on mob teleporting<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMy experience in the top roost is that if there is a aviak<br/>\nstanding on the<br/>\n\t\toutside plus one on the inside right platform, attacking the<br/>\none outside<br/>\n\t\twill pull the one on the inside right platform.
