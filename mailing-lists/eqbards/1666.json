I didn&#39;t have much<br/>\nof a problem soloing between 12-17 (which was back when I<br/>\nrefused to kite too).  Do you remember back around L5-10, how<br/>\neveryone loved to attack goblins because they were wimps<br/>\nrelative to how they /conned?  Some mobs are just tougher, and<br/>\nyou have to find the wimpier ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween 12-15, I&#39;d say soloing was actually better than<br/>\ngrouping.  But the reason for that was server overcrowding.<br/>\nThere are so many people playing in party-safe zones (i.e.<br/>\nones without wandering insta-kill mobs, or the few safe spots<br/>\nin zones with them) that it&#39;s difficult to avoid spending a<br/>\nlot of time sitting on your butts while the fetcher tries to<br/>\nfind something to kill.  OTOH, playing solo, I could dodge the<br/>\nhill giants and griffins in the Commonlands and hunt wisps and<br/>\nthe occasional undead and bear.  Make sure you twist<br/>\nRestoration while you fight, and search for something else to<br/>\nkill as you&#39;re healing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt about 17, my friends and I started fighting in Highhold<br/>\nPass.  Sometimes there are a lot of jerks there, but many<br/>\ntimes the people were pretty reasonable about taking turns.<br/>\nThe orcs came quickly enough that I&#39;d pick up a couple bubbles<br/>\nevery night I played there.  I have a friend who went from 17<br/>\nto 20 in 4 nights at Highhold.  When I solo now, I usually<br/>\npick a risky blue, kite it near a zone, then fight it there.<br/>\nAfter being forced to kite in the Ocean of Tears (red pirate<br/>\ndropped on top of me, and you can&#39;t zone out of the OOT), I&#39;ve<br/>\nexperimented with it a bit more.  It is incredibly boring and<br/>\nusually takes much much longer than if you just fought the<br/>\nthing hand to hand and healed up afterwards.  But it&#39;s useful<br/>\nfor softening up something before the melee fight so that<br/>\nyou&#39;ll definitely win instead of the outcome being iffy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are just some level ranges where the available mobs<br/>\nand spawn rate make soloing better, and some where grouping is<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See my first point on placing mega stats into STA.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At 17-19, I&#39;ve found that a monk is pretty good at drawing the<br/>\nmonsters off me, as can a warrior with decent weapons.  A<br/>\nrogue can do it if you give him a head start.  I still get<br/>\nbeat up pretty badly if there are multiple mobs, but I usually<br/>\nhave two clerics and a paladin in the group so I feel really<br/>\nsafe.  :-)  The impression I&#39;m getting is that the mob magnet<br/>\nbusiness is not as bad as it was when I was around L12-14.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
