Now-a-days I can only do three.<br/>\n I have major packet loss and lag problems that only happen in game every<br/>\nminute or so and traceroutes come up clean . . . go figure.  Anyhow I am<br/>\noff topic *slap*.  I am sure if I didn&#39;t have the PL problems that I could<br/>\ndo four easily with the clipping plane turned down.  By the look of the<br/>\nsong gems un-graying at about half clipping plane distance I bet I could do<br/>\nfour if I concentrate and didn&#39;t have that damn lag.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I will only do three no matter what.  Four is just too much work.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t have a way to optimize three songs.  As for four you really<br/>\nhave to stop and start the next song before you see the graphics and/or<br/>\ntext message of the previous song.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy play list during battle depends on who is in the group and wether or not<br/>\nI feel someone is competent to handle all the duties of their character.<br/>\nSo I really don&#39;t have a mainstay of songs.  Usually by the tenth or so<br/>\nfight, I have swapped songs a couple times and can tell what the group<br/>\nlacks.  After battle I am usually playing mana song(s) or HoR depending on<br/>\nwhat the group needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n46 Bard<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:07 PM 6/12/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;At 01:59 PM 6/12/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.
