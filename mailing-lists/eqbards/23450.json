The <br/>\n&gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the <br/>\n&gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named <br/>\n&gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava <br/>\n&gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laluni Songhammer, 51 Bard of E&#39;Ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
