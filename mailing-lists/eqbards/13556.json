A few things have troubled me:  The Paw change may have helped<br/>\nthe high levels, though I&#39;m not exactly hearing rave reviews about the<br/>\nnew Paw.  As a young character I loved Paw, our group&#39;s best night was<br/>\nthere, but it was switched before our next session, so we never go tto<br/>\ngo back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize it was under used by young players, but none the less, other<br/>\nthan dervs, it was the best place I knew for lvl 12-15 groups to go for<br/>\nmoney. (and we are the ones who actually need the money).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a small thing, but part of a bigger problem.  Dragons been made<br/>\nharder, I see they&#39;re thinking.  Certain guild have gotten really good<br/>\nat killing them and its become easy.  What happens in June of 2045 when<br/>\nmy guild is ready to take on a dragon for the first time?  We wont have<br/>\na shot in hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will never be able to get any of these items which are taken out of<br/>\nthe game because they are too powerful.  I won&#39;t have the chance to<br/>\nbuild up my finances before these money sinks destroy them..<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff like this worries me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I still like the game, though I&#39;m having more trouble (now<br/>\nthat I left oasis and derv camps) finding a decent group (or any at<br/>\nall).  THis is a real problem for a player on the slow boat to levels. <br/>\nAny decent players (at least that I find) tend to play almost every day<br/>\nand level much faster than I (playing my bard twice a week if lucky).  I<br/>\nwas on the verge of abandoning my bard for a solo class this weekend (go<br/>\nback to my magician I guess).  The killer straw for me was a monk who<br/>\nwas looting while a waizard and I died right next to her.  I get back to<br/>\nmy bind (4 zones away, ugh) ang I get the group message &quot;Sorry guys, I<br/>\ncould just not et them off you&quot;.  I dont think I ever clicked disband<br/>\nfaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we talked about groups last week (I found it fun to hear some<br/>\nother group idiot stories), does anyone have any suggestions for a<br/>\ndecent way to get groups for someone who plays too little to get a<br/>\nregular group?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
