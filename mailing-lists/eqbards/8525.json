I died many, many a<br/>\ntimes trying to figure out how to do this. If i could, i would just explain<br/>\nit, but i tried this already. There is no one single trick to mistmoore...<br/>\nits a ton of little things that you learn over time. That being said, a<br/>\nfull party of lvl 40-50&#39;s can get decimated in mistmoore in no time flat.<br/>\nYou pull a couple of harm touching mobs (who knew cooks could harm<br/>\ntouch!?!) and you wont even make it into melee range. I know lvl 50 druids<br/>\nthat go in there and solo the place constantly also, you just have to be<br/>\nwilling to spend some time there. Just dont wander in with a full group and<br/>\nexpect to own the place :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard<br/>\nEncoh Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer<br/>\nTunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:44 AM 10/13/1999 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Dunno your level or type of group you play with, but you <br/>\n&gt;&gt;are in error (not a direct personal attack, maybe just <br/>\n&gt;&gt;misinformed)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then I have been misinformed by hundreds of people I talk to<br/>\n&gt;across every single server.
