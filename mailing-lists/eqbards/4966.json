I&#39;ll mash my NumLock key to start<br/>\nrunning, switch to my hotkey bank that holds my meelee and inv slots and<br/>\nstart swapping, all the sudden I&#39;m not running anymore and/or my Selo&#39;s has<br/>\nbeen ended. Now I have either stand still and finish swapping weapon &<br/>\nshield for an instrument or I have to mash the NumLock again, switch back to<br/>\nmy songs hotkey bank, hit Selo&#39;s (several times lately before it works),<br/>\nswitch back to my slots bank, finish swapping items and hope I&#39;m still alive<br/>\nin the time that it took to do the above. If I&#39;m having an especially bad<br/>\nday, I simply can&#39;t keep Selo&#39;s going and myself moving because I&#39;m being<br/>\nnailed by spells that stun me and turn off my songs. Those are usually the<br/>\ndays that I can&#39;t get very far before being stunned, so another lovely mob<br/>\ngets close enough to me that as soon as I&#39;m unstunned, they bash me and I&#39;m<br/>\nstunned again.<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
