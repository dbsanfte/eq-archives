You just have to hunt in different regions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that mobs for your level would be just to the right of where the<br/>\nriver hits the lake.

So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a wide turn <br/>\n&gt; back while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I deposited the <br/>\n&gt; extra mob back where we were originally fighting and we finished him <br/>\n&gt; off.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Heal Kiting&quot; rocks :o) I used it all the time on the south shore of Eask<br/>\nkarana against Gnoll Reavers.
