Please remember <br/>\n&gt; this is my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ <br/>\n&gt; for about 2 months now, so many of these comcepts are still <br/>\n&gt; new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I have read <br/>\n&gt; the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a <br/>\n&gt; very high level player, I did not understand the EXP share <br/>\n&gt; problem. He just asked me to keep singing my heal song and he <br/>\n&gt; would look after me, I grouped with him for several hours and <br/>\n&gt; didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he said <br/>\n&gt; he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told <br/>\n&gt; him I needed exp and would move on, at that point he said he <br/>\n&gt; had some stuff for me and initiated a trade. I asked my <br/>\n&gt; friend via tell if I should accept and he said yes as I earnt <br/>\n&gt; it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair <br/>\n&gt; of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good <br/>\n&gt; (I could see via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he <br/>\n&gt; said they were, too good for my level. I have banked them for <br/>\n&gt; now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear them/sell <br/>\n&gt; them or give them away. I have no problem with twinking but <br/>\n&gt; dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an <br/>\n&gt; opinion on what I should!<br/>\n&gt;  do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Nina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get your free email from AltaVista at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
