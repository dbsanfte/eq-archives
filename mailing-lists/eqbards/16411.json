I fire up Lullaby and see what happens...  You&#39;re<br/>\nright talk about mass carnage!  There ended being about 3 seperate<br/>\ngroups of 4-6 killing all the sleeping gnolls (I din&#39;t see any sign of a<br/>\n4 limit on Lullaby, seemed I had a LOT more than that sleeping).  My<br/>\nwarrior friend just stood back and butchered the runners (since the<br/>\nyoungins would get the xp anyway).  It took about 20 minutes for them to<br/>\nget the zone clear, but no complaints (it was fun to feel powerful).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen about 45 minutes later, Erollsi Mar smiled on me and Frostbite led<br/>\nus not to a naked Barbarian, but an armored one!  Wooohoo, 20 minutes<br/>\nlater, my roomate was auctioning off his Shiny Brass Halbred, and<br/>\nchallenging me to a duel to see his max damage on his new Langseax of<br/>\nWolves :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
