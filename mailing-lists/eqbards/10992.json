Its possible, but<br/>\nunlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>\nplays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>\nplaying.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>\nprocesses I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those other<br/>\nprocesses.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact, now<br/>\nthat I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making sure<br/>\nthat exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant obviously<br/>\ncannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>\nimplemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>\nrecord speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tQuality Analyst in RL<br/>\n\t(I keep the rest of the programmers honest, or at least awake)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>\nwhoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>\ncoded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>\nit.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>\n*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>\nthe patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>\nbe fixed in the next patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn, programmer extrordonaire...who should be getting ready for<br/>\nwork right now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
