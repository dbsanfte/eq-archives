Well,<br/>\nindividually.  I think magic users are much more powerful than melee types,<br/>\nif there&#39;s any imblalance it is in this manner.  It&#39;s all design I suppose,<br/>\nbut I always felt the battlefield should be for the warriors, while the<br/>\nmages stayed back home in their towers (casting spells fropm there!) or<br/>\nperhaps stood on hills overlooking the battles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn EverQuest the mages are very hardy, and exremely powerful--in this world<br/>\nthe mages are the true masters of the battlefield, and the warriors are<br/>\ntheoir helpers.  For my tastes, a mage should be a little old man or woman,<br/>\ncomplete weakling, easily slaughtered with a gigantic axe...  That is if one<br/>\ncould get close to them.  Of course, how could they ever survive in<br/>\nEverquest?  So mages can survive battlefields, but they still have all the<br/>\ngood without the bad (or not enough of it).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, if I could see anything changed in this game.... it would be the<br/>\nAI!  The parser NPCs use for the quests is technologically backward.  The<br/>\noriginal Zork games had a more complex parser, and these games are twenty<br/>\nyears old!!  In fact, EQ really doesn&#39;t parse for a damn.  It is highly<br/>\nsimplistic for a game so recent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not the worse of it.  You know, one can always tell how poor a<br/>\ngame&#39;s AI is by looking at how the game is designed.  In the first<br/>\nCivilization, the AI was given a chance against the player by letting the<br/>\ncomputer cheat.  In Alpha Centauri, the computer does not cheat at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AI in EverQuest is so poor, the NPCs cheat blatantly.  Camping is not<br/>\nsomething people do just for items.  People camp everywhere!   Groups don&#39;t<br/>\nroam around together, fighting as they go!  They camp, and send out scouts<br/>\nto pull.  The AI is very dumb and can be tricked this way.  I have never<br/>\nplayed a game where trains are a way of life, never even played a game where<br/>\nTrain becomes part of the vocabulary, and I think it&#39;s a problem.  All this<br/>\nstems from poor MOB AI.  If anything needs tweaked, it&#39;s not the PCs but the<br/>\nNPCs!!!  It inspired me to write a poem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanna be an npc<br/>\nBut not some stupid orc<br/>\nI wanna be an npc<br/>\nAnd be a piece o work<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanna backstab with me fists and feet<br/>\nDirk don&#39;t need it see<br/>\nI&#39;d know and cast and memorize every spell there is<br/>\nMana don&#39;t need it see<br/>\nI&#39;d cast and fight and kill with ease<br/>\nI&#39;d be a magic monk<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanna know just everything<br/>\nBut a bard would be too hard<br/>\nSee those aren&#39;t good at everything<br/>\nNpcs are never bards!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanna chase you to the zone so far<br/>\nAnd laugh at all you cowards<br/>\nI wanna chase you if you come to close<br/>\nAnd make you camp in corners<br/>\nHah ha ha Hah ha ha<br/>\nI would not be pulled you see<br/>\nNpcs are are fools you see<br/>\nBut I would be too smart<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanna cheat like the computer<br/>\nAnd get stuck in a corner<br/>\nI wanna cheat like the computer<br/>\nIn a group I&#39;d be a horror<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
