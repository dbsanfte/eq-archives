The only effect that agility has, based on<br/>\nthe tests i have seen, is a minor increase in AC (1 AC for every 5 AGI roughly,<br/>\nthough there are breakpoints [notably, agi 74 to agi 75] where it can do more) <br/>\nThere have been rumors that Agility effects dodge, parry, riposte, etc, but I<br/>\nhave never seen any hard evidence of this.  Based on the evidence I have seen,<br/>\nthe Elf Hide gloves could just as easily say: AC 5, +5 Dex (while this is<br/>\nbetter than Snakeskin, it may or may not be worth the associated cost...I do<br/>\nnot have a single plat that i can throw away, so the Elf Hide are just not<br/>\nworth it.).  If anyone has any _HARD_NUMERICAL_EVIDENCE_ showing what effect<br/>\nAgility has besides 1 ac from 5 agility I would love to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid (err...still no last name)<br/>\n23rd Song<br/>\nFighting tombstones in Mistmoore<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- I actually saw someone trying to KITE in Mistmoore.
