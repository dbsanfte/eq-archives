Seems<br/>\nto me that allying with the giants is far and away the best choice.  The<br/>\ngiants give the most quests (not counting class armor quests which all three<br/>\nfactions have) and you have more places to hunt since you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry about screwing up Coldain/dragon faction.  The Coldain don&#39;t appear to<br/>\ngive any decent quests other than the Garadain series and the Phenocryst<br/>\nFocus series (BTW I really like how those quest series are set up. Wish<br/>\nthere were a lot more like them in the game).  If you want to maintain<br/>\ndragon faction, your limited in the places you can go beyond Kael Drakkal.<br/>\nDragons appear to be the worst faction to ally with.  Seems like all the<br/>\nbest items/hardest zones in Velious will ruin dragon faction.  So if you<br/>\nally with them, you are really limiting your options on places you can hunt.<br/>\nNot really certain how good the quests are that you can get from the<br/>\ndragons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like to hear from those of you who have explored a lot of Velious to<br/>\nsee what you think. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 6:12 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I dont understand is: why is our loot dropping there?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but have you tried to<br/>\nget them? PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>\nfor questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still not<br/>\nfound yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>\nthought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>\nget the similar items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>\nthat, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>\n(role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>\ninteresting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke for<br/>\nthem to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the course<br/>\nof least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 9:42 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue.
