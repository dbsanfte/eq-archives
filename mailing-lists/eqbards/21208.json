Bubble away from 42 myself =)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Which means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo<br/>\n&gt; soon.  When i am the haster<br/>\n&gt; (IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which<br/>\n&gt; i LOVE, the agi buff<br/>\n&gt; gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask<br/>\n&gt; since its high level<br/>\n&gt; song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str<br/>\n&gt; boost I think the haste<br/>\n&gt; effect is the same)<br/>\n&gt; (This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates<br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>\n&gt; Beserker.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bzzzz, wrong answer.  40 or 41 are both crappy songs. <br/>\n40 is single target dispell which doesn&#39;t work and 41<br/>\nis a psalm of something I believe (yep, confirmed it<br/>\non the song analysis page).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your question, looks like you will trade the +23<br/>\nagility and 20% speed for 6 AC, +15 strength, and 17%<br/>\nhaste.  I&#39;m going for berserkers the moment I get it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and<br/>\n&gt; shoulders.  What do you all<br/>\n&gt; reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists,<br/>\n&gt; CHA, and STR (in that<br/>\n&gt; order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me<br/>\n&gt; looted it not knowing it<br/>\n&gt; was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted<br/>\n&gt; bronze cloak (UGH!) and a<br/>\n&gt; straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have<br/>\n&gt; about 2k right now and<br/>\n&gt; dont really have trouble making money, though I<br/>\n&gt; would rather go get a guild<br/>\n&gt; run to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, for shoulders I&#39;m wearing crested spaulders.  11<br/>\nAC +5 or 6 stamina.  Not a bad item I think and it&#39;s<br/>\nselling for fairly cheap these days.  As to back, I&#39;m<br/>\nclueless on what to go for.  I&#39;m wearing a cloak of<br/>\nthe icebear which has a nice cold protection to it. <br/>\nAs to belt, I&#39;m camping the thick banded belt.  That<br/>\n+15 strength just makes me DROOL.  Course, I&#39;m also<br/>\ntrying to get into the frenzied groups so I&#39;m either<br/>\ngoing for a FBSS (+20% haste can&#39;t hurt) or the TBB<br/>\n(+15 strength /cheer).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMind you I try to avoid kunark now.  Max damage from a<br/>\nkunark mob at my level seems to be 107.  Max damage<br/>\nfrom an old world mob seems to be 86.  I&#39;ll wait till<br/>\n46 to go to Karnor&#39;s to go back to Kunark.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Elfson Allegro<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Norrath since December.
