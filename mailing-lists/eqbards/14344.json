It was boring<br/>\n&gt; kinda.  We either annihilated the mobs we faced or got forced to gate real<br/>\n&gt; quick.  With 3 pets we were able to get away every time though.  If we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; have had 2 necros and just 1 enchanter and no mage I think it would have<br/>\n&gt; been even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just curious as to why you didn&#39;t want a mage?  Necro pets were better<br/>\nbefore the weapon delay adjustment, but now I think mages are just as good,<br/>\nif not better.  Necros are very mana effecient, but can&#39;t unload on<br/>\nsomething fast like a mage can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of the all melee group, we went the other way.  We have 4 mages,<br/>\nenchanter and a wizard, all gnomes on VZ around level 11-13.  With 5 pets<br/>\nand blasting power from everyone, we take things down very fast.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink a necro&#39;s DOT would get halfway done before everything was dead.  With<br/>\nplenty of summoned bandages, everyone has a good Bind Wound skill.<br/>\nWe can bandage up anyone to half health in 10 seconds or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
