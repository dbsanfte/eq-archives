I&#39;ve had some fun ther at 16th, and it requires a<br/>\nbit different strategy thn normal.  How many people weave Elemental Rhythyms<br/>\nas a full time part of their attack strategy?  In Lavastorm its a<br/>\nrequirement with al the hot monsters there.  There will be a lot of things<br/>\ntoo tough for you, but it is still a cool place, and the run across<br/>\nNekulutos forest to get there is exciting and cool as well.  Have fun, be<br/>\ncareful!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 1:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Hunting Grounds<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone got any tips on places for a 17<br/>\nlevel traveller to go? I&#39;ve tried Upper Guk, but<br/>\nit&#39;s just a tad bit too dangerous to solo very<br/>\nfar inside. I&#39;ve also tried Befallen and decided<br/>\nthat I hate that place and it&#39;s stinky holes in<br/>\nthe floor and locked doors you can&#39;t escape from.<br/>\n(I&#39;ve befallen and I can&#39;t get up!) I&#39;ve done<br/>\nEruds Crossing, been to Kerra Ridge (didnt kill)<br/>\nand lots of other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaces that I am currently COMPLETELY bored <br/>\nhunting in:<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth/South Ro<br/>\nOasis<br/>\nEast/West Commons<br/>\nGreater/Lesser Fay<br/>\nSteamfront<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Karana&#39;s probably come to mind, but there&#39;s<br/>\nlots of nothing there. And lots of things I can&#39;t<br/>\nfight at my level anyway. Bandits are Dervs to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoot would be nice, experience would be nice - but<br/>\nmore than either of those - some place I could <br/>\nexplore would be great. I recently went through and<br/>\ncompletely (?) explored Blackburrow. Everything was<br/>\ngreen to me (mostly) but it was great fun. I was<br/>\nable to carry enough stuff that I was dragging bags<br/>\nbehind me as I left. Not great stuff mind you, but<br/>\nhey - I&#39;m an explorer - a traveller. I don&#39;t like<br/>\nto camp for too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Veeshan it&#39;s almost impossible to find a group<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t want to just &quot;camp the dervs&quot; or the<br/>\norcs or &lt;insert mob here&gt;. Travellers are far and<br/>\nfew it seems - so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m<br/>\nall ears and songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I recently went to King Xorbbs Gorge (Beholder)<br/>\nand loved it. It was new, it was the first time I<br/>\nsaw (killed) muddites and I was fairly safe. I of<br/>\ncourse didn&#39;t explore the whole thing as I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a map - and getting lost in a place called<br/>\n&quot;beholder maze&quot; seemed like an easy thing to do. But<br/>\nat least it wasn&#39;t Orcs, and it wasn&#39;t Dervs. And<br/>\nthank Tunare it wasn&#39;t spiders or scarabs or snakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations to Susan Davis!<br/>\nONElist&#39;s final FRIENDS&FAMILY WINNER! <br/>\nStay tuned for exciting new contests, sweepstakes & more at ONElist!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
