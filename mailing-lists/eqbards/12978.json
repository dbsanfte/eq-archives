I have a cha of 124 so I told him I would buy<br/>\n&gt;them for him.  With 124 cha with an apprehensive<br/>\n&gt;clocwork jeweler the ruby would&#39;ve costed 135.  He<br/>\n&gt;then gave me some more cha gear that bumped my cha to<br/>\n&gt;143 i believe.  The ruby then costed 131.  So, yeah, I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know if there are any hard level limits in<br/>\n&gt;charisma to achieve certain costs.  Probably not.  It<br/>\n&gt;is probably just the case that most people buy low<br/>\n&gt;costing things--water, rations, etc. from merchants<br/>\n&gt;that have such a &quot;small&quot; price that what they pay for<br/>\n&gt;with 120 cha may still be the same with 140 cha.  It<br/>\n&gt;may only make a difference on the high priced items. <br/>\n&gt;Not sure though. I haven&#39;t tried to buy water with 143<br/>\n&gt;charisma.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thex Luteslinger (Tunare, 31st level)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; As near as I can tell, the prices you get are based<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; charisma, faction, and possibly race and diety. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; With a 110<br/>\n&gt;&gt; charisma, I was able to get the best possible prices<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from<br/>\n&gt;&gt; indifferent merchants, but only some apprehensive<br/>\n&gt;&gt; merchants.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; With my current 154 charisma, I&#39;m able to get the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; best prices<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from most apprehensive merchants.  I suppose it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; could be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; capped at 120 cha (which is between 110 and 154),<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but based on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the extreme nonlinearity I saw when I tested prices<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; different charisma from 75 to 110, I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Verant<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would&#39;ve made it quite so simple.  Items do have a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; maximum<br/>\n&gt;&gt; buy/minimum sell price though.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Btw, anyone notice they finally fixed the wood elf<br/>\n&gt;&gt; merchant<br/>\n&gt;&gt; faction?  For the longest time, WE merchants viewed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wood elves<br/>\n&gt;&gt; apprehensively.  They&#39;re amiable now.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;&gt; John H.
