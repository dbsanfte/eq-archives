They are level 34 spells like the Combine Ones. <br/>\nIt appears ( I forgot to grab /locs on both portals) that the Druid and<br/>\nWizard spells take you to the same location in Iceclad Ocean Zone. A note,<br/>\nwhen I ported in with my level 35 Druid, I was immediately attacked by blue<br/>\n/con mobs. My level 48 Wizzie was not attacked, but I think that is because<br/>\nnothing was near the porter &quot;shack&quot; when I zoned in. The mobs /con green to<br/>\nthe Wizzie. <br/>\nBarge to the Gnomish Icebreaker is caught in NRO at the new pier, just south<br/>\nof the Barbarian Fishing Village. Barge then zones into Iceclad Ocean and<br/>\ndrops you off on an empty island. You then need to run accross the island to<br/>\nthe other side to catch the Gnomish Icebreaker. You can&#39;t miss the dock.<br/>\nIcebreaker ride takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get you to the mainland. <br/>\nOnce you disembark from the Icebreaker, head left to the Gnomish Outpost.<br/>\nOne vendor there sells some of the new Velious Spells. I only saw 1 for each<br/>\nclass on him (except Bards had 4, go figure, hehe), and I was under the<br/>\nimpression that there was 2 for each class. So, as of yet, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhere the other set is (if infact, there is another set). <br/>\nThat&#39;s it for now folks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
