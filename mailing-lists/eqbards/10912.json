I too enjoy helping younger players, and in fact I&#39;m<br/>\nprobably going to help a 19th bard work on his first Lambent Bracer tonight<br/>\n(the piece I judged the easiest to get at his level).  I cook and do pottery<br/>\nas well and find it fun.  Like Sylly I love to hand out pies or cookies and<br/>\nmilk to my parties when we do well.  They always enjoy it immensely.  I have<br/>\nplayers from all over Fennin Ro, some I haven&#39;t grouped with for days,<br/>\ngiving me /tells saying they&#39;ve got a stack of Froglok or fruit or something<br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m cooling down.  The game is a lot of fun and I&#39;ve made some good<br/>\nfriends.  I&#39;ll just try and stear clear of the Lambent-colored guy running<br/>\nfrom beetles in the newbie zones...<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 2:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uhh, this means you look at this as a competition, EQ is not a<br/>\n&gt; competition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My bard is lvl 23 - I don&#39;t particularly care if I EVER get her<br/>\n&gt; any higher,<br/>\n&gt; it will come when it comes. Just broke down the other night and put on<br/>\n&gt; bronze greaves - something I swore I&#39;d never do, still have the banded tho<br/>\n&gt; - may switch back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My focus is LIVING in the world - not monster slaying. UO is much better<br/>\n&gt; for that - play that too, the ONLY reason I am in EQ at all - my husband<br/>\n&gt; started playing, and it is nice not to get stabbed in the back by<br/>\n&gt; a teammate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I fish, cook, do pottery, brew, tailor, smith, jewelcraft a LOT of things<br/>\n&gt; other than slay monsters (which frankly, I wish I could skip<br/>\n&gt; completely). I<br/>\n&gt; am just as happy running around harvesting silk and snake eggs -<br/>\n&gt; as someone<br/>\n&gt; that goes and monster bashes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spend many an evening at the CB zone with my little horn, just derailing<br/>\n&gt; trains - that is FUN for me, saving lower level folks - keeping<br/>\n&gt; some of the<br/>\n&gt; trainwrecks I remember from when I was that level from happening is<br/>\n&gt; ENJOYABLE for me. I also usually chat quite a bit with the lower<br/>\n&gt; levels and<br/>\n&gt; occassionally am even able to pass on some small advice, guess I&#39;m just a<br/>\n&gt; teacher at heart. In particular, I get a ton of folks (and not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; real newbies either - 2nd, 3rd characters of higher players) say - gee - I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know bards could do that, kewl! Lots of lower level bards<br/>\n&gt; have never<br/>\n&gt; heard of twisting, tons of folks don&#39;t know what the heck lullaby is. Bet<br/>\n&gt; they remember later tho - when they are grouped with a bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What does this mean - well, I&#39;ve played for a LONG time, tons and tons of<br/>\n&gt; people I&#39;ve interacted with over my career are 50 - I often get approached<br/>\n&gt; by their 2nd or 3rd characters - Hey...this is so and so, remember me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMHO, basing EQ on levels was predestined to cause this problem. That is<br/>\n&gt; one of the prime things that cause EQ to not be a &#39;virtual world&#39;. In a<br/>\n&gt; virtual world (vs. a game) - there is no end, you can&#39;t &#39;win&#39;. Someday one<br/>\n&gt; of these games will wise up and realize that putting the focus on<br/>\n&gt; living in<br/>\n&gt; the world and interaction, and removing the focus from leveling/pt gaining<br/>\n&gt; will provide a much more immersive and longerlasting environment for it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; users.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being a merchant at heart - of course I&#39;d prefer to buy/trade<br/>\n&gt; things rather<br/>\n&gt; than go bash in some baddies skull directly. There is a whole nother<br/>\n&gt; subgame to being a REAL merchant, if mechanics support it of course. NO<br/>\n&gt; DROP is terrible for that, they would be a whole lot better served by<br/>\n&gt; randomizing the spawn over an area or zone - than artificially saying -<br/>\n&gt; well, if you pick this item up, you can&#39;t hand it to someone else - huh?<br/>\n&gt; Breaking up drops over spawn is the only real solution to camping - and NO<br/>\n&gt; DROP was the bandaid they slapped on that problem. And of course - users<br/>\n&gt; will always find the most direct route to the cheese. We all know since<br/>\n&gt; components are nodrop - lowerlevels can get them without<br/>\n&gt; fighting, and much<br/>\n&gt; lower risk simply by being in the right place at the right time - from<br/>\n&gt; folks camping for xp, not the items. I ask you, what is the difference?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well, enough rant for one day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not<br/>\n&gt; jealousy.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and<br/>\n&gt; that I do not,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some<br/>\n&gt; lower) that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;discouragement at the diminishment of my questing<br/>\n&gt; accomplishments because he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>\n&gt; &gt;steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As<br/>\n&gt; I said in my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically<br/>\n&gt; reflect the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>\n&gt; &gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent<br/>\n&gt; armor was NO<br/>\n&gt; &gt;DROP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Crier<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
