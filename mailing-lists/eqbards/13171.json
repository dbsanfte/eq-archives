But unlike spells, which can be cast and forgotten about for<br/>\nlong periods of time, Bard songs must be continuously sung to work<br/>\neffectively.  A song that could be sung and have a permanent effect would be<br/>\ncontrarian to the way the class works.  Forgetting game balance and all other<br/>\nissues, a binding song just makes no sense in the world of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heck, if we had 6 or 7 combat skills like the other 3 hybrids, I&#39;d agree that<br/>\n&gt; Bind would be completely inappropriate.  But really, it would be like saying,<br/>\n&gt; Clerics can&#39;t have bind because the Rangers would be pissed!  We&#39;re a breed<br/>\n&gt; apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed we are a breed apart.  As another poster has written we are &quot;no-class.&quot;<br/>\n I would almost say that there are four types of player classes in EQ:<br/>\ncasters, melee, hybrids, and bards.  True, we don&#39;t have the combat skills<br/>\nthat the 3 hybrids do.  But we can do some pretty amazing things to<br/>\ncompensate.  We don&#39;t use mana like the other hybrids (Dirge excepted).  We<br/>\ncan reduce downtime like no other class in the game.  We can fill wildcard<br/>\nspots in just about any group: from crowd control to tanking.  To give us<br/>\nthese combat skills would unbalance us wildly, and the next thing you know all<br/>\nthe kewl d00dz would be playing bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love a binding song.  I would love better combat skills.  But I<br/>\nhonestly think that beefing us up in either of these areas would cause other<br/>\nclasses to call foul...and probably result in a suite of unwanted nerfs for<br/>\nthe bard class.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
