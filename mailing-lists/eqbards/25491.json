I<br/>\nhad fun running around and exploring though.  It was really hard for me to<br/>\nmove around at first.  EQ was my first real game and so using the keyboard<br/>\nwas tough and it took me a long time to realize it worked better in third<br/>\nperson in DAoC.  I think you can remap the buttons though.  I especially<br/>\ndespised the using the right mouse button to move forward.  I was like all<br/>\nspazzing out and falling into the moat and stuff.  I really liked how the<br/>\nnewbie mobs are really small and the things get bigger as you go, that was<br/>\nfun.  I think I will play it but am not sure.. maybe between now and when<br/>\nLuclin comes out?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, my guild killed the 4th warder last night!!! Quite a moment<br/>\nof excitement, although for some reason some of the people in our guild were<br/>\nmoving the sleeper around.  (If you didnt know, you can hit him and &quot;move&quot;<br/>\nhim even though he isnt alive).  Anyway, he fell into the water and for some<br/>\nreason teh GMs say that caused the script not to run so now we have to DO IT<br/>\nALL OVER AGAIN TONIGHT.  I hope we can!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 60th Shaman<br/>\nTani 56th Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 7:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Hmmm. Someone else looking at DAoC?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off, the newbie levels are IMO just like EQ with the <br/>\n&gt; small difference<br/>\n&gt; that solo is easier and corpse recovery is non existent. I <br/>\n&gt; actually let my<br/>\n&gt; self get killed to get back to town instead of running <br/>\n&gt; *shrug* There was no<br/>\n&gt; death penalty..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I felt that the mobs where more &quot;stupid&quot; than in EQ. Even <br/>\n&gt; hobgoblins dont<br/>\n&gt; assist eachother when youre alone against them.<br/>\n&gt; *shrug* <br/>\n&gt; I also miss newbie dungeons. All battle at lower levels is in <br/>\n&gt; the open. My<br/>\n&gt; overall impression was the there really wasent many <br/>\n&gt; dungeons.. Hope they add<br/>\n&gt; some nice ones ala Crushbone, BlackBurrow, Befallen etc.. <br/>\n&gt; Dungeon fighting<br/>\n&gt; is fun :)<br/>\n&gt; I also like the prospect of getting into some serius PvP <br/>\n&gt; Something i havent<br/>\n&gt; done since the days of Meridian 59 *grin*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Musiker<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:despyzer@...\">despyzer@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:despyzer@...\">despyzer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; *Snipped some*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  The three <br/>\n&gt; &gt; biggest improvements I think they have made are: (1) Quests: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Apparently they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have some sort of questing journal that helps you keep track <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of all of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; quests you have taken part in and remind you what the next <br/>\n&gt; &gt; step is that you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; need to take. This includes picking up a drop from a mob that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is part of a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; quest. No more spamming a zone asking if anyone knows what <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Raw Sword is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for or something like that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye the /quest command is soooeeee nice....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also, the quests are supposed to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; change for each <br/>\n&gt; &gt; character so they are level specific. No more high levels <br/>\n&gt; &gt; camping low level <br/>\n&gt; &gt; quests for no experience. (2) Travel: I guess there are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; horses that you can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rent from NPCs which run you from stable to stable at a very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fast rate. You <br/>\n&gt; &gt; can jump off at any time or continue to the destination. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobody has to waste <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fifteen minutes of valuable playing time running across West <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karana. (3) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mhh debatable..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Death: Whether it is realistic or not, players retain all of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; their equipment <br/>\n&gt; &gt; after death. Levels can&#39;t be lost due to death either. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Experience loss can be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; regained by returning to the place of death (marked by a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; gravestone) and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; praying. There is also a loss of constitution points which <br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be bought back <br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a merchant. Clerics can also revive experience and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; constitution loss <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (just like EQ, but I thought I should mention it).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        There are other things that I like about DAoC also, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but these are the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; biggees in my estimation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; H<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
