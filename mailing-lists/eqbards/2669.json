If your party is running for<br/>\nthe zone and someone gets rooted, you&#39;re usually better off<br/>\nhitting Accelerando to unroot him and give him back some speed<br/>\nto get to the zone.  (For that matter, SoW cancels root.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
