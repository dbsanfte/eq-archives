If I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like a class by that point, I&#39;m outta there. It<br/>\ntakes the average player a long time to get to 20 or<br/>\nabove. Why should they spend months unhappy just to<br/>\nhope that one day things might be better? You don&#39;t<br/>\ndo it in real life given a choice, nor should you have<br/>\nto in a game you&#39;re supposed to be playing to HAVE FUN<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone hates the way something works, very rarely<br/>\ndoes &quot;wait, it will get better&quot; offer them any comfort<br/>\nor reason to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; change in the 30s.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally speaking, I&#39;ll have given up my bard long<br/>\nbefore I ever come close to that level. It&#39;s already<br/>\nstarting to lose it&#39;s luster to me at 18. I keep,<br/>\nbelieve it or not, 5 characters active. I&#39;ve got a<br/>\nbard, cleric, 2 shamen and a wizard. The bard was<br/>\nthe main one I used a while ago. See the trend after<br/>\nthat? All the other players I play have bind. If I<br/>\nremember correctly, wasn&#39;t it you John that said (awhile<br/>\nago on this list) that if you started over you&#39;d never<br/>\nplay a non-binding class again?   (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. I look at the spells that my binding classes<br/>\nare going to get at the &quot;later levels&quot; and then I<br/>\nlook at the songs my non-binding bard is going to get <br/>\nat those &quot;later levels&quot; and personally I&#39;m not<br/>\nimpressed. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never used<br/>\nthem before. *shrug* But that combined with not being<br/>\nable to bind make the class that less interesting.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
