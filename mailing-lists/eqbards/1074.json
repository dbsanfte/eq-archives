I figured<br/>\nit&#39;d be nice to be friendly with the paladin guilds and the<br/>\ndiety description says many paladins follow Erollisi, so I<br/>\npicked it.  Now that I&#39;ve played the game some, the only<br/>\nfollowers of Erollisi I&#39;ve found are the Sisters of Erollisi<br/>\nin the Ocean of Tears. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed the sisters of Erollisi &quot;kindly consider me&quot;<br/>\ninstead of considering me amiably or indifferently.  Is this<br/>\nwhat other people are seeing from NPCs with the same diety?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
