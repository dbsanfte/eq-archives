Patchwork, going for<br/>\nabout 2pp per piece, or less with quantity, is within reach of the<br/>\nlow level players.<br/>\nThe fact that several pieces of armour are not available in patchwork<br/>\nmeans you should do both IMHO.  Buy the patchwork (or make it) at a<br/>\nlower level, and upgrade as you can affort it, purchasing those<br/>\npieces that aren&#39;t available as patchwork first.  I see no point<br/>\nin shelling out for a leather tunic when you have a patchwork tunic,<br/>\nbut no shoulder pads or face mask.  Sure, a tunic has higher AC, but<br/>\nI think that a patchwork tunic plus another piece of leather (or two)<br/>\nwould have higher AC than the leather tunic alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Patchwork...blah.
