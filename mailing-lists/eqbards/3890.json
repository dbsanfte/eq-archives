I heard the little froggies would not attack me.  It&#39;s true, I am an Agnostic Wood Elf and although I was pissing myself at every encounter with those *Red as Lenin* Frogloks, I had the run of the place.  Well, about 10 minutes into my exploration, I get a /tell from a group of 35+ people camping Ghoulsbane.  Apparently, they have been there for going on 4 hours and were loaded down with FS weapons and loads of cash, and asked me to make a store run for them. Sure, why not, I said.  Now most people would not entrust 300+ pp of loot to a low level (Lvl 13) bard on a whim, but as it turns out, I had helped one of their group with some trivial task before and have on occasion talked with another.  Well It seems they trusted me enough to make that store run for them, and off to the merchant I went... at a crawl.  Now you want to know scary? Try CRAWLING through a dungeon with no Selo&#39;s full of Blood Red Frogloks.  It may just be me, but as I have been to Guk as a Monk hunting the Ancient Croc and the Shin Lord, those Frogs albeit non-hostile, scared me to death.  Anyway, to make a long story short (blasphemy, We&#39;re bards!) I returned in short order with the plat conversions and cash from loot.  Of course, I was expecting a small reward for my services, however I did not say as much... Maybe a FS rapier, or a piece of mesh or two... Imagine my surprise when they gave me a FS rapier, FS dagger, AND a pair of (tympani roll here) ELF HIDE GLOVES! Can you say Bard/Rogue only - +5 Dex +5 Agil - Magic Item?? HOLY COW!<br/>\nSo the moral of the story is - Be friendly (but not a nuisance) to EVERYONE, and you may one day reap the benefits of doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, don&#39;t give me crap about wearing Elf Hide cuz I am a Wood Elf.  I have convinced myself they are made of those Dark Elf hide... Nyah!<br/>\n<br/>\nAcinonyx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
