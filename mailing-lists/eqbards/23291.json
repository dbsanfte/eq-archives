Secondly, we are creating additional experience<br/>\nto further reward those who adventure in groups. Finally, we are increasing<br/>\nthe experience rewards in some areas of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overall effect is that some players, depending on style, should be able<br/>\nto advance their characters up to nearly twice as fast as they once could.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was taken from EQ vault. ^^^<br/>\n<br/>\nThats sounds out of whack to me, so here are my Max increase calculations:<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup of all hybrids (DOn&#39;t laugh I was in one last week in karnors, I(bard)<br/>\nwas the primary healer...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOld xp = 1000<br/>\n+10% (for old group bonus) = 1100<br/>\nEach player gets 183 xp<br/>\n<br/>\nNew system (in a dungeon which got a 20% xp bump)<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal xp = 1200<br/>\n+20% (new group bonus) = 1440<br/>\nEach player gets 336 xp (1440/6*1.4)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite doubles (which would have been 366 xp), but not far off.
