Sure we have a <br/>\ncouple twinks in the teens and 20&#39;s but that&#39;s just that, a twink... <br/>\nWell one of em might be leveling up to 50+ since his necro is 60. If <br/>\nwe&#39;d be so overpowered the populations would be like that of a druid <br/>\nor necro soloers...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Bards are harder to play?  People don&#39;t understand just how <br/>\npowerful Bards can be?  People are twinking new characters to be able <br/>\nto contribute to big raids, where we lose power?  Because the general <br/>\nperception among EQ players is you need a Warrior, Enchanter, and <br/>\nCleric to start a group?  Anything else is unnecessary, duplicate <br/>\nWarriors is preferred?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many possible reasons why there aren&#39;t many Bards in <br/>\ncomparison to other classes.  You&#39;d have to ask each and every player <br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t play a Bard to find out what&#39;s the most common, or most <br/>\naccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saying, that in day to day pickup groups, we have a lot of <br/>\npower.  This is from my personal experience and really only applies <br/>\nat the level I&#39;m at.  And I&#39;m far from the world&#39;s greatest Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying we&#39;re overpowered.  I AM saying we&#39;re definitely not <br/>\nunderpowered.  My original point C&P below was trying to explain that <br/>\npeople aren&#39;t looking at &quot;How difficult a class is to play&quot; when <br/>\nthey&#39;re talking about Bards being powerful. They&#39;re looking at the <br/>\nbest played Bard and seeing just what we can contribute.  There&#39;s no <br/>\ncheck box for &quot;Has had Carpal Tunnel Surgery&quot; in the Power Chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are <br/>\n&gt; overpowered.  The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>\n&gt; were true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level <br/>\n </span></blockquote>advancement <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>flat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>\n&gt; great secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bards <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>\n&gt; bard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>\n&gt; more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>\n&gt; taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>comparison <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>\n&gt; comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>play <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; well.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>\n&gt; playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>\n&gt; different comparisons, really.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>\n&gt; with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>\n&gt; fruits.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkfox </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
