My question is if I m casting a DoT on a mob that s fairly far away (to pull) and he s running towards me and has a velocity the DoT isn t going to do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1651427245\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Essentially, DoT spells do not damage the<br/>\n&gt; NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My question is if I&#39;m casting a DoT on a mob<br/>\nthat&#39;s fairly far away (to pull) and he&#39;s<br/>\nrunning towards me and &quot;has a velocity&quot; the<br/>\nDoT isn&#39;t going to do damage for the time<br/>\nhe&#39;s running? Granted, we&#39;re not talking about<br/>\na lot of damage here, but I&#39;ve been in battles<br/>\nthat were evenly matched hp to hp where I&#39;ve<br/>\nwon with only a few hitpoints (&lt;10) left. Those<br/>\ninitial 5-10+ points that would have been<br/>\ndone could make / break the fight. (Please don&#39;t<br/>\ntell me I should have ran. Many times I&#39;ve had<br/>\nan NPC down to their last bubble when they<br/>\nturned into Rocky friggin Balboa on me and<br/>\nwhipped my butt.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that&#39;s not the intent, but how do<br/>\nyou distinguish between a monster running after<br/>\na moving target and a monster running towards<br/>\na non-moving target? What if the mob is running<br/>\ntowards me and I happen to move a couple steps<br/>\nfor whatever reason? Do I all of the sudden<br/>\nbecome a kiter in the games eyes and no damage<br/>\nis done?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As far as a RP reason for them to fail, how<br/>\n&gt; &#39;bout when you turn to run, you lose control<br/>\n&gt; of the spell and it fails?  (too busy<br/>\n&gt; concentratiing on getting away)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is what having a high channeling skill<br/>\nis for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some of you could tell me since I don&#39;t<br/>\nkite, and I rarely see anyone kiting on the<br/>\nserver (Veeshan) that I play on.. How big of<br/>\na problem is kiting anyway? When&#39;s the last<br/>\ntime you saw someone kiting Lady Vox or trying<br/>\nto kite inside a dungeon?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
