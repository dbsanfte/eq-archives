But GZ flat out stated that the information in<br/>\n&gt; SPDAT.EFF was on test for _testing_ and even made the &#39;joke spells&#39; at the<br/>\n&gt; end to prove his point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I agree it&#39;s likely that our songs will be an afterthought.  Then<br/>\n&gt; again, they always have been.  The Bard class was the single most nerfed<br/>\n&gt; class in the game during Beta.  And even, to some extent, during final<br/>\n&gt; (every DOT nerf affected us, the levitate nerf affected us, etc etc.  Our<br/>\n&gt; charm song even got nerfed because of the nerf to charm spells (with no<br/>\nfix<br/>\n&gt; in sight).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll continue to be ignored.  However, that<br/>\nbeing<br/>\n&gt; said, I still think it&#39;s a bit premature to start crying wolf, before it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; even out of the womb, let alone in our pasture or yard.  I understand that<br/>\n&gt; people are unhappy about what&#39;s in the SPDAT.EFF file, however, I think<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; premature to start complaining about something that is changing on a<br/>\nweekly<br/>\n&gt; basis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And, in response to you, I&#39;ve been playing EQ since Beta 2.  I&#39;ve played a<br/>\n&gt; Bard since Beta 2 (as well as every other class in the game to level 25+).<br/>\n&gt; I care very much about the game and love my bard too.  However, the<br/>\n&gt; difference is, I refuse to complain about something that doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nexist<br/>\n&gt; yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On top of that I&#39;ve been on Test since day 1 of final and seen some pretty<br/>\n&gt; wacky stuff that made it to TEST but never went live.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Ryan Honeyman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 14, 2000 4:09 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Kunark Expansion<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of<br/>\n&gt; fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To<br/>\nsuggest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your<br/>\npart.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   If those spells made it into the file this far, chances are they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   going into the game.  Allbeit, their values/stats/effects may be<br/>\ntweaked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   you can count on those spells going live.  Such is my experience since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   early beta.  (And I don&#39;t mean the bogus InstantKill spell at the end<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   of the file)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides.  I hate that people are even trying to figure this out<br/>\nalready.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or may not happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   And I hate people who think they know Verant&#39;s every move, tell others<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   to chill out, that&#39;s it&#39;s just a game, and then proceed to compose an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   irritated mail about why they don&#39;t really care.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   The people on this list genuinely care about their bards and the fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that no songs are even in the file for testing worries everyone on<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   list.  Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.  I believe<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   same thing will transpire here.  The songs that I imagine being added<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   will come one or two weeks before they ship the final for release, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;d love to have the undying support and optimism some people here<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   try to enlighten us with, but the fact is if you let me down once,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   you let me down twice, you&#39;ll probably let me down three, four, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   more times.  That is the Verant way.  They created a great game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   however they are poorly supporting and adding to their creation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Until something wonderful happens, I will still remain doubtful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
