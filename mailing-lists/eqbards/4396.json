Currently,<br/>\nwhen your character is charmed or feared by another played, you become, for<br/>\nall intensive purposes, an NPC.  Normally, Rallos Zek has a +/- 4 levels attack<br/>\nlimit in effect - I&#39;m level 26, so no one higher than 30 should be able to attack<br/>\nme.<br/>\nBut, while under the fear spell a level 30 necro cast on me, I was very quickly<br/>\nslaughtered by her level 35+ druid friend.  (Thank goodness friends were nearby<br/>\nto loot me, whew!)  Another annoying side effect of this bug is that if you die<br/>\nwhile feared or charmed, you are disconnected from the server and have to re log in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter numerous petitions, a guide informed me this was a known bug and would<br/>\nbe fixed the next patch. (hah!)  Given Verants track record with PvP bugs, I&#39;m not<br/>\nholding my breath...  but at least I can fear them before they fear me now. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLohengrin Windstrider<br/>\n    -bard of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
