Not all casters get<br/>\ninvis/camo (CLE, SHA, NEC), and Wizards don&#39;t get it until level 16, so it<br/>\nthis is not a universal answer for casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, your point makes a case for why casters may not need to be able<br/>\nto bind anywhere, not for why melee classes can&#39;t live without bind/binding<br/>\nanywhere, which is the argument I have been trying to counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my threads haven&#39;t been digressing to far away from bards.
