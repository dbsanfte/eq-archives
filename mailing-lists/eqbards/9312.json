Remember,<br/>\nyou&#39;re eventually going to have to kill your pet.  It is not<br/>\nin your best interest to help it unless someone else&#39;s life<br/>\ndepends on killing the other mob fast.  I usually charm, then<br/>\nconcentrate on staying out of attack range and healing up any<br/>\ndamage I&#39;ve taken.  Charm has a pretty big range, so outdoors<br/>\nyou should never even take damage while doing this.  Keeping<br/>\nyour distance also gives you more time between when the mob<br/>\nbecomes uncharmed and when it&#39;s beating you up.  And remember,<br/>\nyou&#39;re not a caster.  You don&#39;t have to stand still to<br/>\ncharm.  You can do it while running away.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
