Andi... Faesong.. [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:princess@...\">princess@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 07, 2000 12:21 PM<br/>\nTo: EQPhoenix<br/>\nCc: Eqbards<br/>\nSubject: For everyone not online last night<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFaesong [Angelfire]@Solusek Ro has finally surpassed Faesong [Joat]@Test<br/>\n<br/>\nShe made 17 last night, and can dual wield like a true bard (I<br/>\nalso learned that this is the level of Sneak.) She reached this<br/>\n&quot;exalted&quot; level at 3d, 23 h, 1 min.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is even more surprising is that I learned she can dual wield<br/>\nWITHOUT training. After I hit 17, I put two weapons in her two hands...<br/>\n(Staff of Writhing and PGT in the off-hand) And it let me! On my way back<br/>\nto Qeynos to buy my song, I saw a highland lion that conned blue.<br/>\nI went and attacked it. I saw BOTH crushing and slashing attacks.<br/>\nAND I got two increases in Dual Wield (which evidently starts at 35...<br/>\nVery odd. It went up to 36 and 37 as I watched)<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely a Stamina drain though. She was down just under 2bub of stamina<br/>\nafter killing the blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat level does Obsidian Dagger start proc&#39;ing? That weighs less so may<br/>\nmake a better offhand weapon and trade off with slashing and crushing in<br/>\nthe main hand. (I want to keep all three skills maxed)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that she&#39;s 17, I&#39;m going to park her down in the ARena area. Get<br/>\na bind in Arena. Fight kodiaks in Rathe Mountains (they were doing<br/>\ngood for FAerain and Anna at 18-19. if she can get a partner, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink they will be too bad at 17 either.) and aviaks in Lake Ratheteer<br/>\nand South karana. (Don&#39;t ask me. I like fighting aviaks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat comes next:<br/>\nI ordered Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to get Meara [Daring] to 20 before the expansion comes out and<br/>\nmake her EARN that last name. (Right now, appears 20 is when Illusion:<br/>\nIksar is going to be available) She went to Sol A at level 9. I want<br/>\nher to go to Kunark -- all the way down to the newbie areas -- at level<br/>\n20. Once she has done this, I will deem her worthy of the name she wants.<br/>\nShe can hang out down there, make friends with all the newbie Iksars. And<br/>\nmaybe group with them as they get of age to be grouped with. Do quests,<br/>\nhopefully get her faction up such that she can do some selling and not be<br/>\nKoS with the guards. (Hopefully there will be a bank at the outpost.<br/>\nIf so, I&#39;ll make do without banking privileges in Iksar... Don&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe KoS in Freeport either, really... I like being able to go anywhere I<br/>\nwant.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI *think* that this is doable (getting Meara to 20), even for my rate of<br/>\nleveling. It just takes actually being online and wanting to play... Faesong<br/>\ngot from 16 to 17 in just two nights of playing... And I think meara is<br/>\nhalfway to 17 already.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 17 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Qeynos) /<br/>\nMeara, level 16 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&lt;lvl 6 paladin -- baby BASHer!&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
