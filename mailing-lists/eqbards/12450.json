ML and Storm got spanked by Voxxy and yielded the camp to LoD by<br/>\n&gt; prior agreement on a certain time.

We didn&#39;t get spanked at all.  I&#39;ll share<br/>\n  with you what happened Ms. Naive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  LoD (ala FoH) does everything, they just dropped Nagafen, and threatened<br/>\n  to come take Vox next.  The Vox teams rushed around trying to do it all<br/>\n  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.  Then some<br/>\n  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and inadvertantly pulled<br/>\n  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran around, and then<br/>\n  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes were made,<br/>\n  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got spanked.  We didn&#39;t<br/>\n  even fight Vox.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Irritated,<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
