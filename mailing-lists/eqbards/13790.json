I know not all bards spend as much time running around\r<br/>\n&gt; asking people &gt;about quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I\r<br/>\n&gt; am &gt;fairly certain\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that if these really were in the game they would have been found\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by now.  GZ\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;insisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?\tCertainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;especially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;scorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they were\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not.
