The AC for the SS is 6 better than SotA, but the SotA provide STR<br/>\n&gt;and CHR bonuses while the SS has no stat bonuses.  I have been waiting until<br/>\n&gt;I dinged 50 before I started to hunt in Sebilis.  Well I dinged 50 this<br/>\n&gt;weekend so plan to start going there soon.  Now I have heard that SS arms<br/>\n&gt;are not that hard to acquire in Seb.  So I am debating if I should buy the<br/>\n&gt;SS arms now or wait until I can loot them for myself.  The 2K will clean me<br/>\n&gt;out so would prefer to loot them instead of buying them.  But if they are<br/>\n&gt;harder to acquire than what I was told, then I may decide to fork out the<br/>\n&gt;cash.  For those of you with a lot of experience fighting in Seb, would like<br/>\n&gt;to hear what you have to say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
