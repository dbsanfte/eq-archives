So it isn&#39;t a<br/>\ndouble standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you subscribe to the &quot;your actions should not detract from<br/>\nothers&#39; gameplay&quot; ideology, then twinking detracts from your<br/>\ngameplay and you should withhold help from twinkers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhichever ideology you subscribe to, your actions and feelings<br/>\nare self-consistent, and the other ideology&#39;s actions are a<br/>\nviolation.  They are mutually exclusive, and thus there can be<br/>\nno resolution or compromise between the two.  The best we can<br/>\nhope for is coexistence without resorting to petty insults<br/>\n(twinker or jealousy).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can agree to that, I&#39;d like to end the twinking thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
