Assuming that there are three<br/>\ntypes of damage (slash, pierce, and blunt) various armors protect various<br/>\nways. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard, most of these are factored in here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCloth armor isn&#39;t really gonna do much since it is easy to puncture, easy<br/>\nto cut through, and offers very little padding to slow the impact of<br/>\nsomething big and round.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPatchwork usually provides a bit more protection against slash and blunt<br/>\nsince it is slightly thicker than cloth. Piercing it may not improve<br/>\nagainst.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe various leathers (rawhide and normal) are better against piercing and<br/>\nmuch better against slashing because of the toughness of it. Some are often<br/>\npadded decently so it takes the edge off of blunt damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStudded leather would most likely improve upon slashing since the metal<br/>\nstuds would help stop the blade but wouldn&#39;t do much for piercing since the<br/>\nstuds cover such a small area. Blunt might actually hurt more if it hits one<br/>\nof the studs and drives it into your chest. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tReinforced is the same thing but now there is more surface area to stop<br/>\npiercing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRing mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>\nmetal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>\nand allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>\nseeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>\nthe big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>\nreduced to whatever padding is underneath.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChain is the same as ring but usually has tigher links making it a bit more<br/>\ndifficult to slip a piercer in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBanded, similar to splint and scale in other game systems, improves against<br/>\npiercers quite a bit now that most of those holes are filled up. Still some<br/>\nbetween the plates though. Slashing prolly isn&#39;t much better than chain but<br/>\nblunt is probably better now that you have plates of metal that won&#39;t give<br/>\nas easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlate, of course, is usually considered the best. It offers very good<br/>\nprotection against slashers since it is often hard to cut metal. Blunt is<br/>\nreally good since you have that rigitity of a real big piece of metal.<br/>\nPiercing is better since there are relatively few holes to sneak through<br/>\nunless you want to try and force the point of a dagger or rapier through a<br/>\nquarter inch of steel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Rubino [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 1:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Platemail vs Banded vs Leather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Rubino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHello all . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>\nit if anyone can help.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAC continues to be a mystery. It seems to be no more than an overall armor<br/>\nrating, which increases with level and with type of armor, and exists only<br/>\nso that I can compare AC values with jealous people who still have<br/>\npatchwork. Does AC really have a meaning? If so, what does the total AC<br/>\nvalue mean? What does the AC value of a single piece of armor mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow I know from experience that as soon as I went to full banded, my<br/>\nability to take damage skyrocketed. All of the sudden things which used to<br/>\ndestroy me just kept missing me or hitting me for 1 damage. This seems to<br/>\nsuggest it has nothing to do with AC value, and everything to do with armor<br/>\ntype. The fact that the banded &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 25 from<br/>\npatchwork was irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow my bronze &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 15, a small amount compared<br/>\nto my overall AC, but again my ability to take damage jumped significantly.<br/>\nI can again solo everything that is blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI read somewhere that each different type of armor (Leather, Chain, Plate<br/>\nand its equivalents) can absorb more and different types of damage as the<br/>\narmor gets better. This seems to be true, and seems to make the AC value<br/>\nworthless . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBesides, full bronze looks really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlease comment . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 145,000 email communities to choose from!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
