And like a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good group we were waiting patiently for our turn for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good ole Mr. Tae.  Well group A is sitting on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; throne almost when he spawns so they jump him.  Some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; one /shouts Tae and chaos insues.  Our group jumped in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the fray after group A&#39;s casters had dumped their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mana.  Not knowing if I had time to get charm off (not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to mention resist rates on yellows) I hit it with a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pixie strike.  It was below half health when our 1<br/>\n&gt;&gt; caster unloaded.  We got the kill.  Not bad.  BTW I<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yup.  I&#39;m pretty sure that sometimes, Pixie Strike also does a<br/>\n&gt;memory blur (except for the bard of course).  The enchanter&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;mesmerize spells also do a memory blur about 95% of the time.<br/>\n&gt;I suspect the percentage is just lower on Strike.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; love cazic, no place I have ever found where a bard is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so useful for crowd control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmm, I found Cazic open enough that the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize<br/>\n&gt;worked better.  The level 15-25 portions of Permafrost are all<br/>\n&gt;in tight, twisty passages, and the goblins really train there<br/>\n&gt;(10+ goblins is not uncommon, 20+ is not unheard of).  The<br/>\n&gt;numbers make it impossible for an enchanter to target them one<br/>\n&gt;by one, and the close quarters make it pointless for them to<br/>\n&gt;use area effect mesmerize since it also mesmerizes themselves<br/>\n&gt;(only spell I know that works like the bard&#39;s L43 song).  So<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s when it falls (fell) upon me to whip out Lullaby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
