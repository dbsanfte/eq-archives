If you enjoy fishing,<br/>\n  baking, brewing, telling stories around the campfire, then that&#39;s<br/>\n  your POV.  I&#39;m not gonna waste 10bux a month to essentially IRC<br/>\n  with pretty graphics.  I want to advance, I want to have some<br/>\n  goodies, and I want to show those goodies off to people because<br/>\n  I spent the time to earn them.  I want to be a powerful element<br/>\n  to plane attacks and dragon raids.  I was in a group last night<br/>\n  that dinged two L49 people to L50.  L50 people are turning out like<br/>\n  mad.  I&#39;m feeling the crunch too.  Nagafen&#39;s Lair and Lower Guk<br/>\n  are becoming so crowded that it&#39;s rare to even see monsters, let<br/>\n  alone fight them.  I know for a fact that there are at least 100<br/>\n  L50 people on Innoruuk and we add one more avg each day it seems.<br/>\n  When 1/16th of your server&#39;s population is 50, and probably another<br/>\n  3/16th is L35+ that spells trouble and crowding.  Trying to squeeze<br/>\n  a quarter of the server into two zones really hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The whole premise behind your posts is what makes you, yourself<br/>\n  happy.  I honestly find your selfish ripostes to comments about<br/>\n  the whole community very weak and one sided.  What I didn&#39;t miss <br/>\n  is your careless attitude, however.  Whatever makes silky&#39;s 10<br/>\n  dollars count isn&#39;t why I play the game, btw.  And while I respect<br/>\n  anyone&#39;s opinion including yours, you are very much lacking the<br/>\n  delivery of your opinion in an organized, non-offensive manner. <br/>\n  It&#39;s like you&#39;ve got something to prove about yourself, and at<br/>\n  the same time you trying to disprove any statement that comes <br/>\n  down the pipe.  It&#39;s a rare day to see you post complimenting <br/>\n  anything.  I suppose I can continue wishing. 8)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
