He&#39;s in the<br/>\nbuilding that&#39;s most West.  He&#39;s around the back of the pole, so you have to<br/>\ngo all the way in.  He stands about 15 feet tall, or so it seems to my half<br/>\nelf, a bit taller than the other Centaurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played in Paw for about a week and made near 100 plat.  This was fighting<br/>\nNobles, Commanders, Shaman, and Rexx or Lenrel, almost exclusively.  The<br/>\nSnakeSkin mask and gloves are very good sellers at 5 pp, and the Tunic will<br/>\ngo for 7 pp if you&#39;re willing to wait for a Druid to realize he or she needs<br/>\nit.  :P  I have only been able to get about 20 pp for the RTS&#39;, and those<br/>\nspawned VERY slow.  I managed to find 2 in the week I was there.   It&#39;s a<br/>\nvery fun dungeon, I wish I had gone over before level 14 so I could enjoy<br/>\nsome of the other spawn spots, than just Rexx&#39;s area or Lenrel&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Finally got to Paw last night...on Cazic its a bit crowded right now,<br/>\n&gt;but late in the evening people start packing it in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Musil - you&#39;re right - plenty of good loot, and that&#39;s just on the<br/>\n&gt;guards and shaman so far.  I&#39;m level 12 so perhaps I can zoom here<br/>\n&gt;quickly.  Only one problem:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The named centaur Dudley mentioned I couldn&#39;t find!  Checked all the<br/>\n&gt;centaurs in the camp, none had names on them.  It isn&#39;t much to speed<br/>\n&gt;over to N. Karana and the gypsy camp, but a closer merchant would be<br/>\n&gt;sweeter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone else run into this Centaur merchant before?  Does he move from<br/>\n&gt;the town?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shadren, guard-bard of Rivervale </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
