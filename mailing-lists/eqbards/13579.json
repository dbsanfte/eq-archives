They just made it so any new<br/>\nicon would overwrite the top icon in your stack if your stack was full.<br/>\nThis cancel magic addition had nothing to do with that, they just wanted to<br/>\nmake dragons harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis change makes bards invaluable.  Here&#39;s what we did against the dragons<br/>\nthe last few times (think we&#39;ve killed 3 since the cancel magic patch went<br/>\nin).  Buff with a few worthless buffs first, i.e resist disease, see invis,<br/>\netc.  Continue buffing with the good stuff.  Dispel your first crappy buff.<br/>\nFill this new, empty top slot with the elemental rhythems icon.  Every time<br/>\nyou get dispelled, elemental will be the one to go, to be refreshed next<br/>\npulse.  You&#39;ll never lose a buff this way.  Since the dragon has just<br/>\nbreathed on you, its unlikely it will breath again before your next 6 second<br/>\npulse so you wont miss the resists.<br/>\nIts good to actually have 2 empty slots at the top, because sometimes, on<br/>\nrare occasions, the fear icon will be timed just so as to appear in the top<br/>\nempty slot just after its gets debuffed and hasn&#39;t been refreshed yet.  That<br/>\nway you still have a free, top of stack slot for elemental to fall into.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re blessed with being able to twist 2 songs during a dragon fight<br/>\n(lag is usually too bad for me) you could leave more slots available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 50 Bard, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 2:23 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last dragon buff was done in reaction to an exploit (well, maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nan exploit or maybe it&#39;s a techique - hard to say.)  And in a way that only<br/>\nVerant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>\nthe same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>\nstop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>\nthan 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>\nicons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>\nadventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>\n&#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>\nwhatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>\n20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>\nwill be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>\ndifferent from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>\nhave new tactics.  I think you will have great fun when you time comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
