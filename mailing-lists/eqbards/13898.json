There will be a group of lvl 50&#39;s that will rage thru<br/>\n&gt; killing everything just to see what items are dropped even though they<br/>\n&gt; probably won&#39;t want any of them.  Just use a little reverse planar logic<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; code the zone to not allow in players of over X level where X is 12 levels<br/>\n&gt; above the mean mob level.  That would let them create a dungeon for level<br/>\n25<br/>\n&gt; mean that would restrict flow of items out due to players of a level that<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t get xp anyhow running in to farm stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like hard limits.
