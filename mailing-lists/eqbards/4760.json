The interface treats <br/>\n&gt; bards like casters, but that does not mean they can&#39;t alter the interface to <br/>\n&gt; accomodate this request.  Add a Harmony Ability (See Definitions below, esp <br/>\n&gt; #4a, courtesy of Meriam Webster&#39;s Online Dictionary).  This &quot;Harmony&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Ability could take the form of a button on the Abilities menu.  The Bard<br/>\n&gt; pushes the &quot;Harmony&quot; button and then depresses multiple songs in the order <br/>\n&gt; the Bard wants to play them.  The Server then starts each song and<br/>\n&gt; immediately shifts to the next song until the list is completed and then<br/>\n&gt; returns to the top of the queue.  To stop the auto-playing of songs, hit the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Harmony&quot; button and resume manual control.  Simple enough?  The idea is not <br/>\n&gt; without precedent.  [The auto-attack feature of the game is a similar form<br/>\n&gt; of redundancy elimination (which could also be enhanced, similarly to what <br/>\n&gt; is suggested here, to include special attacks like kick or bash or the<br/>\n&gt; myriad Monk abilities).]  There will be some resistance, perhaps even<br/>\n&gt; philosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that <br/>\n&gt; this change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Actually, though probably not something easily coded into the game,<br/>\nthis is a great idea to reduce the twitch-a-mania bards face. Heck, <br/>\nnowadays when I am away from computer, I can see in my MIND the <br/>\ndamn hotbuttons (2 and 3, I always keep selo and hymn there) and <br/>\nwhenever I see people moving around or myself am walking, I am <br/>\nmentally pressing the 2-key. I can see it depress, and soon flashy <br/>\nballs around and thinking of moving faster =P I would not say I am <br/>\naddicted, I would say the damn keypressing has burned into my head!<br/>\nThough my gf probably has other notions about me not being addicted... <br/>\nNow to think of it.. just yesterday left her place at 11pm to go home and <br/>\nplay instead of staying over (to you-know-what), so OK I am addicted.<br/>\nA bit.. not much.. just a bit =P<br/>\n     <br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
