The work is <br/>\nnot mine. I find it hard to find a flaw in his figures, the really scary <br/>\nfigure for bards(Hybrids) is when he states a 50th level fighter has <br/>\nthe same xp as a 36th level Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKipple<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after several hours of testing, I found out some very interesting<br/>\ninformation about experience levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing humans for all tests to avoid any racially based experience <br/>\nhandicaps,<br/>\nI slew enough snakes in North Qeynos and West Freeport to <br/>\nestablish the<br/>\nfollowing experience gaining &quot;tiers&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Warriors, Rogues, and Wisdom-Based Casters gained 0.55 <br/>\nbubbles per snake<br/>\nkill.<br/>\n2) Intelligence-Based Casters gained half a bubble per snake kill.<br/>\n3) Monks gained 0.45 bubbles per snake kill.<br/>\n4) Bards and Hybrid Classes gained 0.4 bubbles per snake kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, you can say that, assuming tier 1 requires (X) raw <br/>\nexperience<br/>\npoint for a level:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Warriors, Rogues, and Wisdom-Based Casters require (X).<br/>\n2) Intelligence-Based Casters require 1.1(X).<br/>\n3) Monks require 1.22(X).<br/>\n4) Bards and Hybrid Classes require 1.375(X).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wis-Based&quot; are the Cleric & Druid.<br/>\n&quot;Int-Based&quot; are the Enchanter, Magician, Wizard, and <br/>\nNecromancer.<br/>\n&quot;Hybrids&quot; are the Ranger, Paladin, and ShadowKnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I&#39;m done with finals I plan to test the experience gain of <br/>\ndifferent<br/>\nraces compared to humans (ie. halfling cleric vs human cleric).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- What does it mean? --<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not certain whether it is right to say that, for example, when a <br/>\nwarrior<br/>\nreaches level 50, a hybrid with the same amount of experience <br/>\nwould be<br/>\naround level (50 * (.40/.55)) = 36; regardless of the exact level, it is<br/>\nobvious that this puts hybrids at a disadvantage, as far as climbing <br/>\nlevels<br/>\nwith a minimal amount of fighting.<br/>\nNow, rumour has it that the experience split among group <br/>\nmembers is NOT<br/>\nproportional to experience LEVEL, but rather to total experience <br/>\npoints.<br/>\nThis means that, if the above formula holds true, a level 14 hybrid <br/>\nwould<br/>\nshare experience equally with a level 20 warrior.<br/>\nNow, where this might be a point of concern, is in a party setting <br/>\nwith all<br/>\nparty members being recruited at the same experience level. This <br/>\nmeans that<br/>\nthe hybrid, due to requiring greater experience to REACH the <br/>\ncurrent level,<br/>\ngains a greater share of the experience than you might have <br/>\nsuspected.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Numbers --<br/>\n<br/>\ngroup 1 -- 3 warriors.<br/>\nEach warrior&#39;s share is 33% of the XP<br/>\ngroup 2 -- 2 warriors, 1 paladin.<br/>\nEach warrior recieves 30% of the XP, and the paladin gets 40%<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER if you consider that the paladin does the work of a <br/>\nwarrior AND a<br/>\ncleric (debatable), you can look at this group composition:<br/>\ngroup 3 -- 2 warriors, (1 warrior and 1 cleric)<br/>\nEach warrior gets 25% of the XP, as does the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you can look at the flipside, when the entire group is hybrid <br/>\nand<br/>\none odd-man-out is a &quot;quick-gainer&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\ngroup 4 -- 1 warrior, 2 paladins<br/>\nHere the warrior gains 27% of the XP, and each paladin gains 37%.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Possible problems --<br/>\n<br/>\nAssumptions:<br/>\n1) All creatures which are labelled &quot;a snake&quot;, and live in either West<br/>\nFreeport or North Qeynos, yield the same experience.<br/>\n2) Stats do not affect experience gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shaman is untested, as humans cannot be shamans. <br/>\nHowever, I expect that<br/>\nthis class falls under wis-based caster.<br/>\nI also did not have time to test the Wizard and Shadowknight; I am <br/>\njust<br/>\nassuming that they follow the pattern set forth by similar classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis data was taken today, April 18th, 1999.
