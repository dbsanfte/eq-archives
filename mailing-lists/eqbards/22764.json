If you are the only person attacking the mob,<br/>\nthen you SHOULD be the only one on its hate list.  So when camping the noble<br/>\nin Sol B, when we knew he (or the PH) was about to spawn, I would stand near<br/>\nhis spawn spot and everyone would move away.  When he spawned, since I was<br/>\nclosest he would automatically attack me first.  They don&#39;t always cast<br/>\ncharm right off the bat, but in my experience its usually always near the<br/>\nbeginning of the fight.  When fighting evil eyes, I would pull instead of<br/>\nthe primary puller.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 08, 2000 8:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Mask<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWoohoo!  Congrats!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, please excuse the dumb newbie question, but in the thread about mobs<br/>\nthat charm, someone said they put away their weapons and get the mob to<br/>\ncharm them first, figuring they&#39;re the least threatening potential pet in<br/>\ntheir group.  My question is, how do you get the mob to charm you rather<br/>\nthan someone else?  Are you just punching away at it, waiting for it to try<br/>\nthe charm spell, before anyone else joins in?  Do mobs that charm<br/>\nconsistently cast this at the start of battles?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 13 songs, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n                    &quot;Shaun Hopps&quot;                                        <br/>\n                    &lt;shaun.hopps@btco        To:                         <br/>\n                    nnect.com&gt;               &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;       <br/>\n                                             cc:                         <br/>\n                    12/07/2000 09:21         Subject:     [eqbards] Mask <br/>\n                    PM                                                   <br/>\n                    Please respond to                                    <br/>\n                    eqbards                                              <br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like to share with you all that after 6 hours of being scared witless<br/>\nin the assassin room I finally got my mask.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevody Songweaver,<br/>\nBard of the 20th Song,<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
