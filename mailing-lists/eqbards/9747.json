I went over near the<br/>\nGorilla spawn because that&#39;s where I was going to hunt with my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was another group there and I role-played asking them if I could loot a mudwater Rune from a<br/>\nFanatic if that got one as I needed it to complete a quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey rudely said no only if you pay us 100PP for loot rights. I politely left the area and said<br/>\nthank you but that was to high.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the argument of &quot;there killing it, it&#39;s there loot.&quot; but if you don&#39;t need it don&#39;t loot it.<br/>\nOr charge a reasonable price to loot it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it going to kill them to help someone out?<br/>\n<br/>\nRanian Aeleroth<br/>\nBard of the 21st song.<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
