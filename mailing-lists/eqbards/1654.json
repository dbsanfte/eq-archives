With 100 CHA,<br/>\nmy ability to solo is virtually NILL at level 13.  Sometimes even<br/>\nblues give me a run for my money!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Well, frankly,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  <br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; I gain so little exp in a group it isn&#39;t even funny. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only reason I&#39;m level 13 is because of grouping.  I did<br/>\nmost of my levelling by grouping with 1 or 2 others that were<br/>\nroughly 2 or 3 levels above me.  When everything you attack is<br/>\nred, you can&#39;t help but get a significant amount of xp.<br/>\nI do believe that this happened before the &#39;bard = enemy #1&#39;<br/>\nbug manifested itself, so that made a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>\n&gt; the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See my first point on placing mega stats into STA.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And in a<br/>\n&gt; group, the combination of my platemail and ability to attract the attention<br/>\n&gt; of the mobs, makes me a great tank, taking the damage whilst the<br/>\n&gt; spellcasters dish it out. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bards are not tanks.  Sure, we can pretend, but that is not what<br/>\nwe were designed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for not wearing plate, I think that just fixing the bug that<br/>\nplaces bards at the top of the s.list would not be enough compensation<br/>\nfor this serious restriction to our AC.  Druids can&#39;t wear this<br/>\nsort of stuff, and get some decent defensive spells too.  However,<br/>\ntheirs stack (generally), but I can&#39;t twist 3 songs - lag and ping<br/>\ntoo high.  So, increased defensive song effects (even if those<br/>\nincreased effects were just for the singer, and not for the rest<br/>\nof the party) would help keep things balanced.<br/>\nOtherwise we would be toast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From a roleplay perspective (oddly necessary for<br/>\n&gt; some of you)  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Umm, is this an ORPG or not?  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRocket</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
