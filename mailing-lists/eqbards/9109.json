CRUNCH! I am at 1/4 of one bubble heath as I stagger across the zone<br/>\ninto South Ro.  Whew!  Those who play with me on E&#39;ci would have recognized<br/>\nthe all-telling &quot;/em wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of his<br/>\nhand&quot; that only appears when I have narrowly escaped having a RL heart<br/>\nattack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI managed to survive the afternoon&#39;s fun and we dropped about 5 or 6 SG&#39;s<br/>\nand nearly 2 dozen spectres.  The funniest thing that got me in stitches<br/>\nevery time was when I ran up on top of a spectre and feared it, then chased<br/>\nit around the desert smacking it.  Nothing beats having &quot;death&quot; fleeing in<br/>\nterror from you for an ironic laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and since I have written this much and realized that no one probably<br/>\ncares, I may as well add that I GOT A LAMBENT STONE!  This adventure in<br/>\nOasis was the most fun I have had in a long time and it was quite satisfying<br/>\nto /shout TIMBER! as my first ever SG kill fell at my feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 26, 1999 12:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Lag -ugh!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday, the lag was incredible.  Constant 15% to 35%, <br/>\n&gt; surges and spikes<br/>\n&gt; into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some <br/>\n&gt; guys getting<br/>\n&gt; dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - <br/>\n&gt; never seeing a<br/>\n&gt; fight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping <br/>\n&gt; a group do<br/>\n&gt; HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, <br/>\n&gt; buffing and mana<br/>\n&gt; song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and <br/>\n&gt; see how he likes<br/>\n&gt; it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and <br/>\n&gt; charms.  So, I<br/>\n&gt; say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you <br/>\n&gt; know where the<br/>\n&gt; named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea <br/>\n&gt; of what is<br/>\n&gt; coming next.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I <br/>\n&gt; click, it trys,<br/>\n&gt; then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is <br/>\n&gt; a cant make my<br/>\n&gt; songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I <br/>\n&gt; look up and go<br/>\n&gt; &quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Followed shortly by<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  <br/>\n&gt; Btw: Kaldivar says<br/>\n&gt; &quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and <br/>\n&gt; frantically<br/>\n&gt; yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>\n&gt; glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and <br/>\n&gt; desparately trying<br/>\n&gt; for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped <br/>\n&gt; to the Western<br/>\n&gt; Karana.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some <br/>\n&gt; lag bug? Selos<br/>\n&gt; would not start and since there is no icon and were no other <br/>\n&gt; mobs being hit<br/>\n&gt; - there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder <br/>\n&gt; than that.  I<br/>\n&gt; scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not <br/>\n&gt; recall seeing &quot;a<br/>\n&gt; Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard <br/>\n&gt; hate&quot; when stuff<br/>\n&gt; that likes you attacks you!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and <br/>\n&gt; helped my group<br/>\n&gt; kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it <br/>\n&gt; seemed almost<br/>\n&gt; too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the <br/>\n&gt; crowd control.<br/>\n&gt; She could park them as necessary while we feared (although <br/>\n&gt; not the bard<br/>\n&gt; fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  <br/>\n&gt; Never thought I<br/>\n&gt; would be saying that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 34th song<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Productopia2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
