If you like the<br/>\nfreddy kruger look . They are not that bad... 9/24 +3AGI Primary only (could<br/>\nhave been fun to dual wield)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got the Kobold Jesters Crown (ac15 cha30 agi5 int-30 dex-5 wt0.0) Not<br/>\nthe perfect item for skill increases, but I think I will use it when<br/>\ncharming. Besides it dont weigh anything, so its &quot;free&quot; to drag around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth items dropped in the village. The Crown of a named. and the claws of a<br/>\nnormal kobold I think<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker, Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 20. juli 2001 17:16<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: AW: [eqbards] Katanas<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You very well maybe right and even if there isnt a low delay <br/>\n&gt; cap that makes<br/>\n&gt; other weapons even better, because there IS max haste.  5/24 <br/>\n&gt; + max haste is<br/>\n&gt; still slower and less dmg then 9/18 + max haste or even 6/23 <br/>\n&gt; which would be<br/>\n&gt; pathetic as well.  The only way I see this weapon being worth <br/>\n&gt; a flip is if<br/>\n&gt; its a proc, the proc lasts a descent amount of time, and you <br/>\n&gt; find yourself<br/>\n&gt; in a group without a bard/enchanter or shaman.  Otherwise I think its<br/>\n&gt; nothing more than eye candy.  Dont get me wrong I like good <br/>\n&gt; looking gear I<br/>\n&gt; have a set of wicker armor I wear on my Iksar monk from time <br/>\n&gt; to time when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just trying to look &quot;cool&quot;  hehe.  But unless you are <br/>\n&gt; rich or really<br/>\n&gt; just want to look good I think the weapon is going to be over priced.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still borred at sea for another 2 Months 2X days.  : (<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mu  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 4:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: AW: [eqbards] Katanas<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is definitely a twink weapon.  The only one I have seen was on a<br/>\n&gt; twink, and it does look awesome.  And I think the low delay <br/>\n&gt; cap is just<br/>\n&gt; a rumor, refuted by tests.

That&#39;s pathetic.  The haste is irrelevant<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; you can only have one haste item and one haste &quot;spell&quot; at any given<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; 5dmg is dreadfully low and there is a limit as to how low, even with<br/>\n&gt; haste,<br/>\n&gt; the dly on a weapon can be.  Max haste isnt that hard to get, and 5/24<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; rotten, jade mace 9/18 less than 10k on my server and I am sure lots<br/>\n&gt; cheaper<br/>\n&gt; on others.  If you are just looking for the looks then maybe <br/>\n&gt; you will be<br/>\n&gt; happy with it.  But as a weapon for anyone high enough to <br/>\n&gt; actually group<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; get it.
