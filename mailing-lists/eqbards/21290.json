The resist rates do not conform to what GZ told<br/>\n&#39;us&#39; they should be.  Whether they conform to what he told Abashi they<br/>\nshould be or not is unknown.  I&#39;m sick and tired of fighting trying to<br/>\nconvince Verant.  They are arrogant idiots beyond reasoning with.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nfinally decided to just win by not giving them any more money.  The sad<br/>\nthing is, and many of my friends have said this as well; its not just EQ we<br/>\naren&#39;t going to play any more.  We have no interest in ever purchasing<br/>\nanother game from Verant.  That is what is really going to hurt them in the<br/>\nend.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter having a lengthy discussion with two of the folks from Artifact<br/>\nEntertainment (Horizons) over the Labor Day weekend, I can see a night and<br/>\nday difference in their approach as opposed to Verant.  Both David Allen,<br/>\nthe president and CEO, and Doug Shuler, the art director and visual<br/>\ndesigner, were extremely personable and open to suggestions from those in<br/>\nattendance.  Having known Doug personally for several years, I am confident<br/>\nthis was not a put on to garner interest.  Both were praiseful of much that<br/>\nVerant has accomplished, but both were also equally horrified and confused<br/>\nover the way Verant treats its customers.  It was that treatment, over and<br/>\nabove everything else that inspired them to go out and put together a team<br/>\nto make a game that was willing to treat its players the way they wanted to<br/>\nsee them treated.  I hope they get it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 10:16 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Official confirmation from Ester<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 2 options. Roll over and die or Fight it. As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>\nthan my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far several issues are unaddressed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>\nis. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>\nwe can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>\nmore effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>\ncan prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>\nresist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>\nthink we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I propose...<br/>\nI&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>\nLullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>\ncritter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>\non. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>\nacurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>\nwell as the log file.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nMinstel of Norrath<br/>\nTribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
