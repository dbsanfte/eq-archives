I raised a SK, Druid, and<br/>\nRogue to +20th, and also played a Monk, shaman, cleric, warrior and<br/>\npaladin eact to at least 10th. I started a Bard because i could never<br/>\nfind the Druid Guild in Kelethin. I kept finding the Bard guild so i<br/>\nsaid &quot;screw it, at least i can find this place&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my last count, my performances as a bard have inspried no lees than<br/>\nNINE seperate players to start bards (that i know of). I know of these<br/>\nbecause they either say &quot;WOW, bards can do THAT? I&#39;m going to make one<br/>\nnow!&quot; or I get &quot;Bardx tells you &quot;hey, this is your old friend warriorx,<br/>\nhow do i play more than one song at a time?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis shows me that Bards ARE powerful (if soloing a Sand Gaint at 33rd<br/>\nlevel didn&#39;t tell me that already). I see no need to complain about our<br/>\nclass, in fact I tell all the bards I see to keep it quiet. after all,<br/>\nwho wants a party of 6 bards? Bards make things possible for other<br/>\nclasses, we don&#39;t generally Kill the mob, we just make it possible for<br/>\nothers to do it when normally they could not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, other than our obviously broken songs, my only complaint about<br/>\nbards is this: why can&#39;t safe fall cap at 100? we are arguably the only<br/>\nclass that REALLY needs this skill. I was out pulling sand giants the<br/>\nother day and my group would go &quot;hey Uldar got hit! you find a SG?&quot; and<br/>\nI&#39;d reply &quot;no, I just ran over a dune&quot;. very anti-climatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n33rd Bard of Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
