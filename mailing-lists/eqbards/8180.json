GMs are there to help you with in-game problems.  They cannot<br/>\nmodify the database or give you a different item.  They don&#39;t even interact<br/>\nwith Developers.  GMs cannot fix this type of problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are /feedback and /bug commands to take care of these types of<br/>\nproblems.  These commands will be routed to the Developers who can fix the<br/>\nproblem.  Or email your complaints to Verant directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you order pizza delivery, and your pizza is running late, who do you<br/>\ncall?  You probably dial 911.  Instead, you should think about who can<br/>\nactually help you with the problem.  Call the pizza company.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should this matter to us?  Well if IDIOTS fill the petition queue with<br/>\nRETARDED petitions, it takes the GMs longer to handle real petitions.  How<br/>\nwould everyone on Innoruuk feel if their petitions took 30 minutes longer to<br/>\nhandle because some IDIOTS felt they could get the database changed by<br/>\nfilling up the petition queue?<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your frustrations, but don&#39;t frustrate everyone else with your<br/>\nactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 07 Oct 1999 10:27:14 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: New Bard Quests!

Man I was ripped off, this sucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /petition You all messed up again, you gave me cleric type<br/>\n&gt; armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize bards primary stats<br/>\n&gt; are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You probably just typo&#39;d in the<br/>\n&gt; armor database again, which is fairly typical these days. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GM tells you &#39;Hail, guide Soandso here.  I&#39;ve read your<br/>\n&gt; petition.  And honestly there&#39;s nothing I can do, if you<br/>\n&gt; would file a bug report that would be appreciated&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If Verant does this again, like they did on the PoS, err I<br/>\n&gt; mean PoF armor (not to mention the pisspoor color) I will<br/>\n&gt; flood them with feedback/petitions/etc.  In fact everytime<br/>\n&gt; I take a faction hit from someone else&#39;s kill, I petition.<br/>\n&gt; Only the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and typing a message<br/>\n&gt; in a bug report that is never read gets me more frustrated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hate working hard for a crappy reward.  That&#39;s why I currently<br/>\n&gt; do no quests (for the ones that actually work).
