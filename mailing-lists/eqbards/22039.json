I have just returned to the list and EQ after a 2 month hiatus. I<br/>\nhave finally hit level 30 with my Bard, Ranian, and I am looking for places to<br/>\nhunt now to get through relatively quickly. I am currently soloing Froon and<br/>\nChoon, killing bandits for sashes (actually gives a little xp and reduces<br/>\nboredom for me) and Ulrich McMannus in WK. I don&#39;t want to do him to much as my<br/>\nBarb faction is low as is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other places can I hunt solo or with a 32 Enchanter for good xp?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know my equipment is out of date but what would be suggested that isn&#39;t to<br/>\nexpensive?<br/>\n<br/>\nArms: Lambent Vambraces<br/>\nBack: Cloak of the Icebear<br/>\nBracer 1: Lambent Bracer<br/>\nBracer 2: Bracer of Scavenging<br/>\nChest: Lambent BP<br/>\nEars: Opalline Earring (2)<br/>\nFace: Mask of Deception<br/>\nFeet: Lambent Boots<br/>\nFingers: Jagged Bands (2)<br/>\nHands: Iksar Scaled Gloves<br/>\nHead: Skull Shaped Barbrute<br/>\nLegs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\nNeck: Cape of the Midnight Mist<br/>\nShoulders: Pegasus Feather Cloak or Bloodstained Mantle<br/>\nWaist: Troll Hide Belt<br/>\n<br/>\nOther: MM Drums, Runed Bone Fork, Gnoll Hide Whip, Blade of Fiery Lamentations,<br/>\nObsidian Shard (2) and Enamelled Black Mace.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help and I enjoy the list a lot.
