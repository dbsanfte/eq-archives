I had continued to put<br/>\nforth my view on things long after I had realized that it was pointless to<br/>\ntry and convince him just so any other readers of the board out there could<br/>\nsee the other side.  I don&#39;t want 1 guy knocking bards (even if they make<br/>\nfools of themselves doing it) and other people seeing it and maybe being<br/>\nswayed by it.  Thank you Silky for backing me up there, so people see it&#39;s<br/>\nnot just 2 differing opinions.  I hope it&#39;s not too far down the list to not<br/>\nget any readership.  Maybe they need a counter on each post... hmmmmmmmmmm<br/>\n: )<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a more recent post on the same board with a new bard requesting<br/>\ninfo.  I responded with the onelist address.... If our membership is only<br/>\n300, there has to be at least a 1000 more bards out there that aren&#39;t<br/>\ngetting the valuable information that&#39;s on this list.  Maybe the moderator<br/>\n(I forget who it is right now, heh) could get EQVault to reference the<br/>\nonelist URL again to drum up some more membership.  I think the worst thing<br/>\nto any class (especially one that&#39;s a little more difficult to understand<br/>\nlike a Bard) is somebody playing it that doesn&#39;t really know what they&#39;re<br/>\ndoing.  If it&#39;s the first experience with that class, people they group with<br/>\nmay just assume that the Class is bad, not the player....<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox - 4 bubbles from Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\nLet no Bard go Uneducated!  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I read that thread, the guy simply didn&#39;t have a clue.  You pointed it out<br/>\n&gt;time and again that the bigger the group, the more effective a bard is,<br/>\n&gt;and he just refused to see it.
