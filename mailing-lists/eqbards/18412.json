Anyhow,<br/>\nwhen I see raptor, I think falcons & hawks.  If they intended a pre-historic<br/>\nreference, I would have thought they&#39;d use a &quot;drake&quot; or one of the flying<br/>\nthings that look pre-historic.  These &quot;raptors&quot; look like a Flintstone(tm)<br/>\ndino and are 100% land based (ok, they do swim if they get feared into the<br/>\nwater).  Confused me - but then I used to be a birder.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. a long time ago, in a real world, far, far away... I used to be a<br/>\nlegal, licensed, practicing falconer.  Some of the birds I have known up<br/>\nclose and personal include: red-tail hawks, kestrals, goshawks, prairie<br/>\nfalcons for the sport and a golden eagle (re-habillitation bird.)  Some of<br/>\nthe books I bought to learn the techniques were written in the 16th<br/>\ncentury - heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Perhaps a Princess...&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 08, 2000 2:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bow for bards!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It looks simply wicked!
