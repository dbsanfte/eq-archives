It was apparent to me, before I even wrote the first post <br/>\nwith the first question, that you already used the song.  So the <br/>\nquestion never applied to you in the first place.  Of course, now the <br/>\nthread has been completely derailed from people giving suggestions <br/>\n(what, there was one answer?) and into discussing whether this song <br/>\nis worth memming again.  My question was trying to move the discusion <br/>\nOFF whether it&#39;s useful (because we&#39;ve established that most people <br/>\nsay it&#39;s not) to what would make it useful.  Maybe I&#39;ll start <br/>\naddressing you as GrollerDaBard the way you manage to highjack a <br/>\ntopic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this is valid if you are charming.  it seems like most bards don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>charm in groups with an enchanter, so that makes this only valid in <br/>\nnon enchanter groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s valid in groups without chanters, or in groups where you&#39;re <br/>\nstill charming even with an Enchanter present (to satisfy groller, <br/>\nfew Bards are in this situation).  It&#39;s also valid if you ever think <br/>\nthat maybe you&#39;ll lose the Enchanter in 10 minutes and may need mana <br/>\nto charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nStatus: Non-bogus reason making DDD useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; recast is not an issue since you can swap it out whenever you don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have enough mana to cast it and swap it back in when you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecast contributes to usefulness in the sense of damage over time.  <br/>\nThis probably belongs in combination with the next point about damage <br/>\nbeing weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nStatus: Non-bogus reason, in combination with other bad aspects of <br/>\nthe song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mob scaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; it may be pitiful, but so is bard melee.  does that mean you don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>melee at all? it may not be the be all end all of all damage songs or <br/>\nspells, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there is no place for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons stated 450 damage vs. a 100k mob is worthless.  You point <br/>\nout our melee is also worthless.  So how does that make this song <br/>\nmore valuable?<br/>\n<br/>\nStatus: Non-bogus reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&quot;It&#39;s AE, and I&#39;d NEVER use an AE song..

It&#39;s still a reason given <br/>\nby Bards and one I threw up there (and answered with my own opinion <br/>\nif you remember correctly) to get some discussion going.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;So, my question is... &quot;What would have to change in order to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>justify <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;memming this song?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>\n&gt; &gt;plays from 43 to 60.

And yes, we <br/>\nalready know you think it&#39;s useable every once in awhile, which means <br/>\nthe original question didn&#39;t apply to you at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
