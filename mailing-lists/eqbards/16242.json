Our guild is <br/>\n&gt; planning an outing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there this weekend and I would appreciate some advice on <br/>\n&gt; strategies and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;locations for hunting there.  We are going to try to take <br/>\n&gt; down the predator<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as well, would that be within the capability of a full group <br/>\n&gt; of 22-29&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(avg level 26).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I only ever hunted from the Fur Room (as described in those <br/>\n&gt; emails) so I can<br/>\n&gt; only talk about that. My technique for pulling was:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Go out looking playing Elemental Rhythms, carrying a lute.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If a wizard was in the pull I would switch to a drum, for the <br/>\n&gt; return trip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chain to pull, then Back to Elemental for the run back to the room.<br/>\n&gt; Elemental during a wizard pull really seemed to save me a lot <br/>\n&gt; of damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very, very often I would get stunned, you just have to breath <br/>\n&gt; deep and hope<br/>\n&gt; your back is to the wall and wait it out, the Cleric would be <br/>\n&gt; waiting for<br/>\n&gt; me(gotta love a really diciplined group that trusts each <br/>\n&gt; other)...that is<br/>\n&gt; where the lute came in, the instant I would get unstunned I <br/>\n&gt; would start<br/>\n&gt; running and fire up Largo&#39;s Binding or Lull. When I got back <br/>\n&gt; to the room,<br/>\n&gt; start with CoD, DDD, Binding, Anthem for the tank. or when <br/>\n&gt; using weapons<br/>\n&gt; Anthem, Elemental, Binding, Lull.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, the main rule is never ever ever let any fire goblin <br/>\n&gt; get behind you,<br/>\n&gt; they all (er, pretty sure all) backstab huge. Keep your back <br/>\n&gt; to the wall at<br/>\n&gt; all times. You can&#39;t always help that while pulling, so make <br/>\n&gt; sure you are<br/>\n&gt; going to have a heal waiting for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
