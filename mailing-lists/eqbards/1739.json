Had no idea it was there. I was just<br/>\ntrying to turn on auto-split from my keyboard. Instead, that&#39;s a different<br/>\ncommand. /split is kind of interesting though as it allows you to share<br/>\nmoney with your party... In case you don&#39;t know the command, it&#39;s /split w x<br/>\ny z    w x y z are all numerical values. w=platinum, x=gold, y=silver, and<br/>\nz=copper. All four numbers need to be in there (even if they&#39;re just<br/>\nzero...) Pretty interesting...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn other game-things-people-don&#39;t-know items, why is it that a large number<br/>\nof elves seem to carry around lanterns? I thought that was a human<br/>\naffectation... Oh well...<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\nRank 8 Wood Elf Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 13:58<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Utility of Lullaby and Invisibility songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get some things (rings, etc.) to add dex so that you can dodge more<br/>\nhits.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try to get your party to attack fewer mobs at one time - I know<br/>\nsometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they all get pulled in - but sometimes a cleric can lull a few while you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pull the other one or two away.

However, I<br/>\n&gt; have come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>\n&gt; are not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>\n&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>\n&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>\n&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; that.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
