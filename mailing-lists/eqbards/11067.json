What I think happened is that what they<br/>\nsaw in beta was incorrectly interpreted:<br/>\n<br/>\nsome gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting we<br/>\nwill fix that&quot;<br/>\nnerf<br/>\n<br/>\nsome gamers find new ways to use tricks to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting<br/>\nwe will fix that - normal players will never do that&quot;<br/>\nnerf<br/>\n<br/>\nrinse, repeat<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;ok, beta is over folks - thanks for all your help! say good bye now cus we<br/>\nare gonna delete your chars (again - hehe)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\ncommercial release<br/>\n<br/>\nsome gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp - post it on their web site and<br/>\neveryone does it = &quot;oh they are exploiting we will fix that&quot;<br/>\nnerf<br/>\n<br/>\nsome gamers find new ways to use tricks to gain xp - post it on their web<br/>\nsite and everyone does it = &quot;oh they are exploiting we will fix that -<br/>\nnormal players will never do that&quot;<br/>\nnerf<br/>\n<br/>\nrinse, repeat<br/>\n<br/>\nThey did not or maybe even could not have anticipated the success of their<br/>\nproduct and the desire for the player to &quot;win&quot; even as it means enduring<br/>\nendless hours of boredom.  And it&#39;s this boredom and the needless &#39;hell&#39;<br/>\nlevels that will turn away the casual to medium level players.  At some<br/>\npoint, if you develop a game where the players compete against AI, you need<br/>\nto decide how many people you will allow to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI contend as I have in the past that they should not make it harder to get<br/>\nto level 50 - but they should make it more fun for everyone to get there.<br/>\nThat is if they want to maximize their their player base retention.  If<br/>\ntheir model is: get to 50 or get frustrated and get out - then what they<br/>\nhave is just fine.  Right now its real hard to break thru 35 and keep going<br/>\non my server - one because of the game design itself and how hard it is to<br/>\nget xp without hours and hours played.  And two because there is a big bunch<br/>\nof player right at or near my level (mid 30&#39;s) Lower Guk on a popular night:<br/>\n70 players vs 40 or 50 froggies?  Solb - same deal.  Kith was a good try but<br/>\nhas been kinda fizzled becuz of too much insty-death situations although I<br/>\nhave not been there in a week (becuz nobody else was in the zone to even get<br/>\na group going).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the heck is so hard to understand: make the game more fun and people<br/>\nwill play it more - and pay.  Make the game harder and more frustrating and<br/>\npeople will leave - in droves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a run down:<br/>\n<br/>\nAzmo - 35 frustrated and stopped cus he cant get decent xp in 2 hours a<br/>\nnight<br/>\nAejis - Azmo&#39;s friend quit now too cuz his friend is not there to play with<br/>\nBate - cut back cuz Azmo and Ae are not on - so he is roughing it with<br/>\npick-up groups<br/>\nSkwid - quit a couple months ago after a nerf that made his war get less xp<br/>\n- also a casual play for an hour or two type<br/>\n&quot;mr x&quot; - raised a player to 20&#39;s and got frustrated with slow xp for casual<br/>\nplay - bought an ebay account - not playing either one much - prolly bz<br/>\nworking<br/>\nthrifmir - raised a wiz to mid 20&#39;s - went away on business for 2 weeks and<br/>\ncame back to most of his friends too high to group with - so now hes not<br/>\nplaying any more<br/>\nsylly - still here ;p<br/>\nnadare - level 48 enchanter<br/>\nxaera - level 50 SK as of 2 days ago<br/>\nmoods - level 50 Cleric as of 3 days ago<br/>\n<br/>\nSo out of 10 - 3 make the end by hard core power gaming, 1 or 2 struggle on<br/>\nand the other half quit?  What kind of ongoing community will you have when<br/>\nyou suffer a 50% loss getting &quot;winners&quot; and then have huge loss rates among<br/>\nthe &quot;winners&quot;???  &quot;Welcome to level 50 - the level of nothing to do!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are issues that they did not seem to think of - I can understand that<br/>\nthey had their hands full with lots of other issues building the world and<br/>\nthe game but I do have some fundamental concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time - I really need to get level 38, 39 and 40.
