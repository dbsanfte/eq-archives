Having heard the stories about the GM event<br/>\nand all the undead that had spawned in Kithicor I was more than a little<br/>\nedgey about travelling through the forest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I entered the zone from West Commons the ground was covered with corpses<br/>\nthat had yet to be reunited with their owners, needless to say this did not<br/>\nmake me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent prayer to Karana<br/>\nand bolted down the path to the South. Just passing the HighHold marker I<br/>\ngot a tell from someone asking me to hold a sec, so I did and was greeted by<br/>\na Ranger who was looking for someone to do a corpse retrieval for a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I would have happily aided these folk, but being where I was and<br/>\nthe rumors I had heard I was more than a little hestant. He assured me that<br/>\nhe and his guild had spent the better part of the day clearing the woods of<br/>\nthe undead minions, so with his assurances I agreed to begin the search.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs luck would have it, the corpse was nearby, just lost in the famous<br/>\nKithicor fog. The corpse and it&#39;s owner reunited I kicked up Accelerendo<br/>\nonce again and was about to depart when my trade window popped up and I<br/>\nfound that the Ranger was giving me 200 gold for my aid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomedays it&#39;s good to be a bard!<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
