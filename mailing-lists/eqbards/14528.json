I was able to kill it with 59 HP left.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happens to me all the time when my GF&#39;s mage goes LD.  When someone<br/>\ngoes LD, their character turns into an NPC.  The pet is then able to be<br/>\ndamaged and thus pissed off at you.  The only way I know to stop it is for<br/>\nthe player to log back in in time, or to kill the pet.  Or, to stop playing<br/>\nANY AE song as soon as you see the LD message.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.

So my question is where is good to<br/>\nhunt solo or in a pickup&lt;shudders&gt; group? I&#39;m burnt out with Lake Rathe and<br/>\nSK been there since 17th when I left that hell on Norrath HighPass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe courtyard in Cazic might work, tho all trains from the other areas run<br/>\nthru there.  It&#39;s also very laggy for me, for some reason.  Courtyard in<br/>\nMistmoore is similar, with more trains and less lag. :)  EK has some crag<br/>\nspiders that might be soloable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.    My current weapon load is Bladed Claws in Primary, Silvery 1h axe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>secondary, and Dragoon Dirk in Ranged slot, I sometime switch in a BE Mace<br/>\nin secondary to raise 1hb so I can use the Head Bopper Staff I have in the<br/>\nbank when I make 29th. Is this a good weapon load or should I change<br/>\nanything around ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest to put the Dirk in one of your main weapon slots occasionally,<br/>\njust to keep piercing maxed.  The stats on the Mace are better than the<br/>\nThulian claws (bad weapon other than the look, imo)... I would use the Mace<br/>\nand Axe as main weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
