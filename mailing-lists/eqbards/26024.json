Didn&#39;t mean for it to look that way.  But do consider that this list is made up of people who have enjoyed playing bards.<br/>\nIf it takes the combined efforts of this list to convince you that this is a good class to play, your gaming efforts are probably better spent on another class.  EQ is meant to be fun and this list is about playing your bard effectively.  So if you want to know how to use those songs ... let me assure you that you&#39;ve come to the right list.<br/>\nTyunes<br/>\n Bill Costlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nKaz,<br/>\nYour compliant is noted.
