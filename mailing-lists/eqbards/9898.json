If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-729876268\">Hmmm, I&#39;d don&#39;t think I would rate skills that cap at &#39;Bad&#39; as passable<br/>\nunder any circumstances.  Especially when Master level is really 200 and not<br/>\n101.  If you doubt this just ask any bowyer who&#39;s tried to make a trueshot<br/>\nwhen he became a Master.  Our guild ranger has a Fletching of 135 and is<br/>\ncurrently 0 for 10 trying to make one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, even at 75 the skills are not high enough to be considered handy at<br/>\nall.  That&#39;s why no one uses them.  Getting a pick locks at 40th level that<br/>\ncapped at 75 is a joke.  If they really do implement more locks in Kunark<br/>\nyou won&#39;t see many 40th level bards unlocking them or else they will be<br/>\ntotally meaningless to the rogues with their skill of 200.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the skills bards get are not useful but are certainly thrown up as<br/>\nbeing part of our play balance equation.  Offhand I&#39;d list Hide, Sneak, Pick<br/>\nLocks, Disarm Traps, and for some people Forage as nearly useless.  Not sure<br/>\nhow well our Instill doubt works, or why we would use it since we cannot<br/>\nbackstab.  What other class (with the possible exception of Rogues who are<br/>\nalso pretty hosed) has even half this number of useless skills?  Certainly<br/>\nnot any of the other hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 8:59 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Jack-of-all-trades<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Special foraged foods<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Nov 10/99, Crysarra de&#39;Danaan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucretia_71@...\">lucretia_71@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Crysarra de&#39;Danaan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucretia_71@...\">lucretia_71@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a few words here...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard= jack of all trades, master of none<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dispite the fact that this tired old adage is dragged out every time<br/>\n&gt; this debate comes up, did you ever stop to actually think what jack<br/>\n&gt; means?
