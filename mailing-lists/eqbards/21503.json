The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>\nsong combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>\nUnfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>\nnot just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>\naren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>\nmeleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>\noutcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>\na movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, we still shine in broken, unbalanced groups, but those very same<br/>\ngroups can&#39;t really &quot;get anything done&quot; in kunark. At least not when you<br/>\ncompare them to groups that are balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah. It&#39;s their world. They make the rules. This doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\npeople don&#39;t have the right to tell them that the rules they have made for<br/>\nthe bard class squeeze the fun out of it at higher levels.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the<br/>\n&gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually<br/>\n&gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play<br/>\n&gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case<br/>\n&gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades<br/>\n&gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just<br/>\n&gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me<br/>\n&gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.
