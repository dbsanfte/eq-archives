Ah. Ok, that made sense.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course, aren&#39;t these types of players typically worse than the one that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brought them up from level 1? I mean you get the &quot;ebay&quot; twinks that <br/>\n&gt; have no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea what they&#39;re doing and get everyone killed. Then again, at least in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a guild they&#39;d have more support from a group overall.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Thought this question might lead to some good discussion]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think there&#39;s a heck of a lot of difference between an e-bay twink and<br/>\n&gt;a character who&#39;s played to 50+ switching to another character. And<br/>\n&gt;especially a bard, who&#39;s probably in the best position to watch how<br/>\n&gt;other&#39;s play their characters. Assuming some intelligence in the<br/>\n&gt;person involved, I&#39;d say the 2 harders characters to pick up would be<br/>\n&gt;the cleric and the enchanter myself. I&#39;ve run across L50+ enchanters I<br/>\n&gt;know played those entire 50+ levels themselves who still aren&#39;t very<br/>\n&gt;good. At the same time, I&#39;ve played in guild groups with one of our<br/>\n&gt;enchanter characters played by a cleric who was excellent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To introduce another possible discussion point, the most noticable thing<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve noticed about enchanters I don&#39;t consider very good is that they<br/>\n&gt;seem to stun less. The enchanters in my guild always seem to stun first,<br/>\n&gt;sometimes twice, before going to mez. This seems to allow them to keep<br/>\n&gt;way more mobs mezzed than other enchanters I&#39;ve played with. Anyone else<br/>\n&gt;notice this? I have a rl friend on another server who has a 50+<br/>\n&gt;enchanter who said she doesn&#39;t use stun much because she&#39;s paranoid of<br/>\n&gt;the through walls and ceiling problems with AoE spells in dungeons. The<br/>\n&gt;only time I&#39;ve seen this be a problem for our guild enchanters was on<br/>\n&gt;the first isle of Sky where the AoE stun brought the quest mobs up from<br/>\n&gt;inside the island (twice, we still don&#39;t let him forget that one). It<br/>\n&gt;sure served to show how ingrained the stun first, mez later habit was<br/>\n&gt;with him though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have another character that I play with my wife since I eventually <br/>\nconvinced her to start playing. This is a close little group of friends. <br/>\nI&#39;m playing a cleric and my friend an enchanter and we are now around level <br/>\n22-23.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both use stun regularly to pull mobs off of each other. I love my <br/>\nstun/holy might during combat, and with my enchanter friends&#39; 2 stun spells <br/>\ncan keep all sorts of things on ice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t really thought much about stunning a mob before mezzing them. <br/>\nI&#39;ll bring this up with my friend and maybe give it a try. Unfortunately, <br/>\nwe&#39;ve moved away from Frogtown in Lake of Ill Omen which was pretty common <br/>\nfor multiple pulls. Of course, we don&#39;t have AOE stun spells so I can&#39;t <br/>\ncomment about that, but AOE mez has been extremely nice as long as our <br/>\ngroup keeps the frogs together.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
