No worries tho -- you can buy armor from players or maybe trade something for it.  tailoring skill is an option too.  or you can go to FP later and buy.  I&#39;d stay in kelethin tho.  Orc hill totally rocks thru 7th lvl and crushbone is good xp too, especially if you do the belt/shoulderpad quests.<br/>\n  compugeeke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:compugeeke@...\">compugeeke@...</a>&gt; wrote: I now have my Bard almost to Level 5, having alot of fun so far.  I <br/>\nsometimes find things like sleeves or shoes or scarves on corpses but <br/>\nwhen i try and wear the items it says in red letters  &quot;your <br/>\nrace/class/diety (etc...)&quot; and it won&#39;t let me use the items.  I also <br/>\ntried to buy a training tunic, same message.  The item (tunic or some <br/>\nsuch) that i got when i first talked to the guildmsater is gone <br/>\nbecause i died a bunch of times and couldnt find my corpse (now i <br/>\nhave locating lyric which is just awesome)  So my question is,  What <br/>\narmor *Can* I wear?  I am a Half-Elf Quelious Bard is that <br/>\nrestricting me somehow?  Should I learn how to sew and make my own <br/>\nstuff?  Is it the fact that I am still below level 5?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have kept giving spiderling silk to the guildmaster and every <br/>\nso often i get a gold piece, some experience and a drum.  I have 4 <br/>\ndrums now do I need to keep them or should i just keep 1 of them?  <br/>\nSorry if I&#39;m asking silly questions, but that&#39;s what newbies like me <br/>\nare for aint it?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nthat is all...<br/>\n<br/>\n-fohat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
