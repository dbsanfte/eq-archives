If someone uses his high level character<br/>\nto get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>\ndepriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>\nincreasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>\njealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>\nout a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I&#39;ll repeat what I said last time:  The real meta-issue<br/>\nbehind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>\nweren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>\nbecause the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
