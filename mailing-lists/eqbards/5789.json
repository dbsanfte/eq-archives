This was a few<br/>\n&gt; weeks back - I&#39;d love to hear its working now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Ok, due to many questions and remarks of people not getting<br/>\nanything useful out of DEM, I guess it works only on some very<br/>\nlimited array of spells.

First time for me, so after first spawn<br/>\nand a bunch of DOTs on me I memmed DEM (disenchanting melody).<br/>\nDots and other stuff necromancers throw, whatever they are =)<br/>\n2nd spawn and again had a few of dots etc. tickling me after the fight,<br/>\nfired up DEM (probably had lute already up), if I remember right it removed<br/>\nall the dots on the first pulse. So it does work.. however, someone could<br/>\ntest it more spesifically, with root, snare, all kinds of dots, drowsy line<br/>\nfrom shamans etc. And then petition those that don&#39;t get removed.<br/>\nI believe it should remove any malicious effect. Don&#39;t know if root/snare<br/>\netc. count yet as being offensive, since they don&#39;t do damage =P Anyways,<br/>\nDEM does work. Poorly, but it works ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
