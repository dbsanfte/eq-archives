And <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m dying, I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;think. I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known <br/>\n&gt; in some years.   <br/>\n&gt; &gt;It is highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned <br/>\n&gt; heavy luggage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to agree, of the lists I&#39;ve been on, this is one of <br/>\n&gt; the best.  We <br/>\n&gt; generally get few mindless rants and many insighful opinions <br/>\n&gt; compared to the <br/>\n&gt; ratios on, say, the brewing list.  I personally think it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; because of the <br/>\n&gt; kind of person that likes to play bards, but I have a slight bias. = )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;* It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roop, you yourself helped me to start really traveling long <br/>\n&gt; distances, and I <br/>\n&gt; am quite grateful you took me on my first trip to Halas <br/>\n&gt; (bashing vengeful <br/>\n&gt; skellies, getting lost in EverFrost - hmmm sounds like a good <br/>\n&gt; song title).  <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but in the last three days <br/>\n&gt; I have traveled <br/>\n&gt; from Kelethin to Halas to Qeynos (one night), from Qeynos to <br/>\n&gt; Halas back to <br/>\n&gt; Kelethin (another night), and from Kelethin to Freeport (last <br/>\n&gt; night).  Every <br/>\n&gt; night I also made stops in Mistmoore a few times (hoping <br/>\n&gt; against hope for <br/>\n&gt; someone to sell me the dang drum).  Now, this is definitely <br/>\n&gt; travel on a <br/>\n&gt; global scale.  I do it often - heck, I have saved up enough <br/>\n&gt; Stormbreaker <br/>\n&gt; frequent passenger miles to qualify for the Kunark cruise <br/>\n&gt; First Class.  <br/>\n&gt; Everyone does not stay put - many do.  But then, many people <br/>\n&gt; do stupid <br/>\n&gt; things IRL too, and I feel no compulsion to follow them there either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions <br/>\n&gt; &gt;suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  <br/>\n&gt; Camping is central <br/>\n&gt; &gt;to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest? <br/>\n&gt;  How else do <br/>\n&gt; &gt;you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; camping for <br/>\n&gt; &gt;items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every <br/>\n&gt; outdoor zone. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to <br/>\n&gt; the wall.  And <br/>\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, <br/>\n&gt; since I so <br/>\n&gt; &gt;loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently <br/>\n&gt; &quot;camped&quot; there <br/>\n&gt; &gt;now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like camping either.  I do almost all my hunting in <br/>\n&gt; outdoor zones, <br/>\n&gt; and I run around looking for good game.  This may become <br/>\n&gt; harder and harder <br/>\n&gt; at higher levels, but for now I rarely find it difficult to <br/>\n&gt; track down <br/>\n&gt; something around my level to hunt... I have spent a lot of <br/>\n&gt; time killing <br/>\n&gt; kodiaks in the Commonlands, hunting beetles in the Karanas, <br/>\n&gt; etc.  This is <br/>\n&gt; not camping - I literally run until I find something to kill. <br/>\n&gt;  Yes, if I am <br/>\n&gt; in a dangerous zone like North Karana (wayyyy to many grifs <br/>\n&gt; wandering around <br/>\n&gt; to hang out in the middle) I do pull monsters away from the <br/>\n&gt; action to a <br/>\n&gt; place of relative safety, such as Xanuusus&#39; little grove to <br/>\n&gt; the North.  But <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just a basic survival tactic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t like camping?  Avoid dungeons unless you have a <br/>\n&gt; good group.  Most <br/>\n&gt; groups do camp spawn points because it pays off.  I find this to be <br/>\n&gt; typically boring, just like you do.  Yes, the best loot is <br/>\n&gt; found by camping. <br/>\n&gt;   So I make money by hunting and by performing and by doing <br/>\n&gt; people favors <br/>\n&gt; and I buy the loot I am unwilling to camp.  I have even had <br/>\n&gt; fun a few times <br/>\n&gt; camping, but this is entirely dependant on the group.  People <br/>\n&gt; who like to <br/>\n&gt; screw around, have some fun, make humorous emotes... they can <br/>\n&gt; really liven <br/>\n&gt; up a boring few minutes of waiting.  I try to be such a <br/>\n&gt; person when I can, <br/>\n&gt; and seek out the company of others who actually want to roleplay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A small digression - warriors can stop to heal and casters <br/>\n&gt; can stop to med <br/>\n&gt; without camping.  Just because you stop to rest for a few <br/>\n&gt; minutes does not <br/>\n&gt; mean you are compelled to stay there until something attacks you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;:My solution:  No natural regeration of wounds, for anyone.  <br/>\n&gt; This is not <br/>\n&gt; &gt;how wounds work, afterall.  A warrior is wounded, make no natural <br/>\n&gt; &gt;regeneration but increase effect of bandages.  They want <br/>\n&gt; healing, find a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;freaking cleric.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You said you wanted less down-time?  Removing healing would <br/>\n&gt; cripple everyone <br/>\n&gt; except clerics, druids, shamans, and of course us bards.  <br/>\n&gt; Now, while I am in <br/>\n&gt; favor of grouping, how would a level 1 character ever survive <br/>\n&gt; if he could <br/>\n&gt; not heal at all?  Every healer in the world would be <br/>\n&gt; CONSTANTLY bombarded <br/>\n&gt; with people begging for heals, and in fact the healer <br/>\n&gt; classes, now very <br/>\n&gt; overpowered, would see a huge influx.  Hell, I think <br/>\n&gt; personally we&#39;d see a <br/>\n&gt; LOT more bards.  But the point is, this is not at all feasible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;No regeneration of mana either.  I know there&#39;s no <br/>\n&gt; real-world counter-part, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;which others would point out THIS IS A GAME anyway in the <br/>\n&gt; last argument, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;but we&#39;re talking logic.  Mana, where does it come from?  <br/>\n&gt; The physics of <br/>\n&gt; &gt;mana? Where is this pure energy coming from?  Apparently <br/>\n&gt; Norrath does have <br/>\n&gt; &gt;gravity, and follows Einstein, so we must assume Energy <br/>\n&gt; cannot be just <br/>\n&gt; &gt;created out of thin air.  It needs a source....  The soul I <br/>\n&gt; always assumed, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;but that can only supply so much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Exactly why there is a set mana regeneration rate... casters <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t just get <br/>\n&gt; all their mana at once.  Their soul, or spirit, recharges at <br/>\n&gt; a rate based on <br/>\n&gt; their requisite characteristics.  If a wizard is more <br/>\n&gt; intelligent, he has <br/>\n&gt; greater mental capacity to hold the energy he manipulates... <br/>\n&gt; becuase he <br/>\n&gt; understands and uses this energy intellectually.  A cleric <br/>\n&gt; needs wisdom, <br/>\n&gt; becuase his link to the energy flow of the world is through <br/>\n&gt; the depth of his <br/>\n&gt; understanding of how his god manifests in the world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Enough with everyone sitting on their duffs.  Burn mana in a <br/>\n&gt; battle, run <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and hope you&#39;re not chased to find a private spot to channel <br/>\n&gt; spirit spell <br/>\n&gt; &gt;to regain all your lost mana.  I want the game to require <br/>\n&gt; people to be on <br/>\n&gt; &gt;THE MOVE and not encourage them to sit around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rather than requiring you move, I&#39;d like the game to reward <br/>\n&gt; you more if you <br/>\n&gt; do.  A difference in approach... I noticed last night that <br/>\n&gt; quests now give <br/>\n&gt; appreciable experience.  Heck, at level 15 I think I saw a rise from <br/>\n&gt; delivering the mail, and I got about 1/4 bubble for killing <br/>\n&gt; the Nybright <br/>\n&gt; sisters and bringing their necklaces to their besotted <br/>\n&gt; father.  So Verant is <br/>\n&gt; taking some small steps to encourage people to do quests, <br/>\n&gt; which pretty much <br/>\n&gt; always involve moving around.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;*  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;especially one that is so Player vs. Environment based.   <br/>\n&gt; This is AI that <br/>\n&gt; &gt;was seen in Doom, if that.  The wonder of AI that some folks <br/>\n&gt; are impressed <br/>\n&gt; &gt;by how it acts, when it&#39;s actions are not that complex.  <br/>\n&gt; MUST be improved. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, the AI is far from perfect, and it has numerous bugs.  <br/>\n&gt; Still, I remember <br/>\n&gt; recently facing a camp of orcs and being impressed that the <br/>\n&gt; oracles sit in <br/>\n&gt; place and buff up all the cents, that when you attack one <br/>\n&gt; they will all mob <br/>\n&gt; you, that they figure out who is the greatest threat and <br/>\n&gt; typically all <br/>\n&gt; attack it at once... that is what they&#39;re doing, I hope.  I <br/>\n&gt; like to believe <br/>\n&gt; that monsters attack bards preferentially because we are the <br/>\n&gt; greatest threat <br/>\n&gt; to them...  No, they are not as smart as players... well, <br/>\n&gt; most players. = )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;* Tradeskills are lacking.  I have a feeling, given a year, <br/>\n&gt; this may work <br/>\n&gt; &gt;out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Absolutely.  I regret the fact that Verant does not give much <br/>\n&gt; support to <br/>\n&gt; trade skills, and that brewing has been so difficult of late. <br/>\n&gt;  I am sure <br/>\n&gt; that has hit you as hard as it has me... nerfing Ol&#39;Tujim&#39;s, <br/>\n&gt; then releasing <br/>\n&gt; a lot of new recipes onyl to find we can&#39;t make many of them... it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; frustrating.  I recently took up baking for kicks, and have <br/>\n&gt; found it to be <br/>\n&gt; pretty fun.  I don&#39;t try to make a profit off trades anymore, <br/>\n&gt; I just do it <br/>\n&gt; for the roleplaying...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;* Death.  There is no death.  I want to die.  I cannot die.  <br/>\n&gt; Who were the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;generation before this, the immortal generation?  Totally <br/>\n&gt; ignored by the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;story of the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have never played any computer game (that I recall) where death was <br/>\n&gt; &quot;real&quot;.  You either get resurrected with some penalty, or you <br/>\n&gt; have a certain <br/>\n&gt; number of &quot;lives&quot; per game, after which you start over with <br/>\n&gt; another set of <br/>\n&gt; &quot;lives&quot;.  Granted how many times we die in EQ, I am very glad <br/>\n&gt; death is not <br/>\n&gt; permanent... otherwise no one would ever make 10th level. = )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;It is like a moment locked in time, it never changes.  No <br/>\n&gt; matter what <br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, <br/>\n&gt; regardless what <br/>\n&gt; &gt;level the real folk have gotten to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is <br/>\n&gt; unchanging.  Join a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;massively online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!  <br/>\n&gt; There is no ongoing <br/>\n&gt; &gt;plot. Everything is the same.  It always has been, always <br/>\n&gt; will.  McQuaid <br/>\n&gt; &gt;wants people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, <br/>\n&gt; when they buy <br/>\n&gt; &gt;them or find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost <br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt;always that same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like to see some sort of plot evolution too... but <br/>\n&gt; the point was <br/>\n&gt; well made elsewhere.  How would any new player ever keep up <br/>\n&gt; with massive <br/>\n&gt; changes?  Now, maybe some day Antonius Bayle will be <br/>\n&gt; assassinated, and <br/>\n&gt; Qeynos will fall under the sway of his evil brother... but <br/>\n&gt; even something <br/>\n&gt; like this would massively screw with newbies in that zone.  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t honestly <br/>\n&gt; know, algorythmically, how to solve the problem of having an <br/>\n&gt; evolving plot <br/>\n&gt; that does not cause all new characters to be at a HUGE disadvantage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;* Fix the damned NPC parser.  Using Scott Adams Parser in <br/>\n&gt; 1999!!!!  Infocom <br/>\n&gt; &gt;got it better in 1985!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, the parser is not very sophisticated, granted.  I&#39;d like <br/>\n&gt; to see this <br/>\n&gt; improve as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;* To really encourage roleplaying and a community allow <br/>\n&gt; people access to an <br/>\n&gt; &gt;in-game print press.  Where they can make their own <br/>\n&gt; newspapers or books. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Allow people to own a deck of cards so they can play kings court and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;gamble. Make a Roulette Wheel when a PC spins it everyone <br/>\n&gt; can watch the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;text as it clicks along.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, there is one option along these lines... the message <br/>\n&gt; board in Qeynos.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to see these in every city in Norrath... some of the <br/>\n&gt; personals are <br/>\n&gt; really funny... Mael trol luking for inky pet fur barshin and <br/>\n&gt; luvvin...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to see the cards too... though I hear there are <br/>\n&gt; cards in game, I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think we can play.  After all, in the Bristlebane <br/>\n&gt; section of the <br/>\n&gt; manual don&#39;t they warn you against playing King&#39;s Court with <br/>\n&gt; a worshipper of <br/>\n&gt; the god of tricks?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;NAMELY<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;GIVE folks options besides combat!!!  I ask this, because <br/>\n&gt; the way combat <br/>\n&gt; &gt;works in EverQuest bores the living crap out of me.  If it <br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t for the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;way groups worked, &quot;heroes&quot; sitting around in some safe corner while <br/>\n&gt; &gt;squires hauled the monsters one at a time for them.... BAH!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The options besides combat are few, but meaningful.  There <br/>\n&gt; are quests... I <br/>\n&gt; know there are a finite number, and many don&#39;t seem that <br/>\n&gt; rewarding.  I use <br/>\n&gt; quests as a means of accomplishing one of my personal goals: <br/>\n&gt; I want to make <br/>\n&gt; all the NPCs in the cities I frequent love me.  I want to <br/>\n&gt; have everyone I <br/>\n&gt; deal with look on me warmly.  So I go off and run small <br/>\n&gt; quests and feel like <br/>\n&gt; I am progressing towards a huge and nigh-impossible goal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is exploration... Norrath is pretty big, and given <br/>\n&gt; enough time and <br/>\n&gt; dedication I am sure you can see everything... but given the <br/>\n&gt; rare spawns and <br/>\n&gt; the fact that many things move around, the same zone is not <br/>\n&gt; the same each <br/>\n&gt; time you visit it.  I want to see the Lake Rathe monster!  I <br/>\n&gt; want to see the <br/>\n&gt; named sea serpent in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron!  I want to give Cazic Thule a <br/>\n&gt; wedgie!  Well, ok, maybe not soon, but someday...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Most importantly, there are other PCs.  Most of the really <br/>\n&gt; good times I have <br/>\n&gt; had in EQ have been in player interactions.  Last night a <br/>\n&gt; good friend of <br/>\n&gt; mine named Murtik sent me a /tell to say a friend of his was <br/>\n&gt; on a scavenger <br/>\n&gt; hunt and wanted some edible goo.  He was willing to pay well <br/>\n&gt; (15pp for 3 of <br/>\n&gt; them!!!) so I ran back to Freeport with my friend and master <br/>\n&gt; baker Bayrn.  <br/>\n&gt; We brought the goo and gave it to Guta, and also threw in <br/>\n&gt; some cookies and a <br/>\n&gt; Blackburrow stout, on the house.  We eneded up sitting around <br/>\n&gt; the bank for <br/>\n&gt; about a half hour, just talking and drinking and screwing <br/>\n&gt; around.  I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; even say it wasn&#39;t profitable (beyond the very genrous money <br/>\n&gt; for the goo)... <br/>\n&gt; the kindly Guta appreciated my roleplaying and my generosity <br/>\n&gt; (hey, he gave <br/>\n&gt; me a lot of money for something made out of fire beetle eyes <br/>\n&gt; and rat ears, I <br/>\n&gt; was in a good mood) so he gave me some bronze armor.  He was <br/>\n&gt; happy, I was <br/>\n&gt; happy, and it had nothing to do with killing things or camping.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roop, you were an inspiration to me when I was a young lad in <br/>\n&gt; Kelethin.  You <br/>\n&gt; gave me my first drink of Elven Wine (now I have maxed out my alcohol <br/>\n&gt; tolerance every level since).  You took me on my first trip <br/>\n&gt; from Freeport to <br/>\n&gt; Halas.  You answered some of my newbie questions about bards. <br/>\n&gt;  I am truly <br/>\n&gt; sorry to hear you are not enjoying the game anymore.  I think <br/>\n&gt; you can find <br/>\n&gt; other things to do in Norrath that you will enjoy more, and <br/>\n&gt; sincerely hope <br/>\n&gt; that some of the suggestions I gave above will be helpful.  <br/>\n&gt; If not, I for <br/>\n&gt; one will miss you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May your voice always be sweet,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aloro (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
