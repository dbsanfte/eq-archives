Functionally, it works like a game<br/>\npad in that it has buttons that are programmable and will send keystrokes<br/>\nwhen you click them.  But the manufacturer and presumably the design is<br/>\ndifferent from yours.  Does your work with &quot;other games&quot; ??  Ie: is it a<br/>\nGravis install issue or an EQ issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom time to time in my gaming career, I have had to fight battles with<br/>\njoystick drivers.  Sometimes, you could load the equipment and program it<br/>\nwith the OEM software but the OEM drivers would not work with Windows.  So,<br/>\nyou had to set the joystick/gameport to a generic one (two-axis/two button)<br/>\nto get things to work or to partially work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes you needed to have the resources set to a very specific port<br/>\nsetting in device manager - resources (201-201 for a certain joystick I once<br/>\nhad would work where 200-209 would fail.)  And of course if you have<br/>\nconflicting interuppts or memory addresses, you need to resolve those.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine hooks up inline with my keyboard cable so it can send in keystrokes.<br/>\nIf the Gravis tries to do it through redirecting the calls to the keystroke<br/>\ninterupts and EQ is polling that area of ram directly - there could be<br/>\ntrouble. Are there any &#39;switches&#39; or jumpers on the Gravis you can set?<br/>\nCall Gravis Tech Supp? Do they know if it will work with EQ?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry that I cant be more help,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I splurged on Friday and overnited 2 x 128 meg PC100 ram sticks and a<br/>\ngeneric TNT2 agp card.  basically my 2nd pc (P2-333 128 meg old STB agp<br/>\nLightspeed D3D) was doggin&#39; badly in Kunark.  Now it&#39;s much better &lt;g&gt;  Both<br/>\nboxes have 256meg ramski and decent vid cards. Sorry John Kim - I vastly<br/>\nprefer my VooDoo3 3k and glide over TNT2 D3D - D3D is very granular and the<br/>\ngamma is way off (of course a 3rd party program adjusts it for me and even<br/>\nmy hummies can kinda see now.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ronnie Roads&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 01, 2000 2:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Request for harware help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From time to time we get onto a hardware topic; my turn ;).
