Well<br/>\nsomeone pulled a big train through to the zone with the gypsies.  Anyways,<br/>\nafter multiple zones and rezones. the zone was finally clear, we head down<br/>\nthe ramp and what do we see.... the named gypsie alone by the little lake<br/>\nwith a charmed magician and his pet. We went for it.  We almost bit it as<br/>\nthe magician was attacking us as he was charmed, his pet was on us, and the<br/>\ngypsie charmed our druid as well... Needless to say it wasnt pleasant to get<br/>\nbit in the butt while i was trying to kill off the pet and had the magician<br/>\non me as well. But finally the rest of the group finished her off, the druid<br/>\nbecame uncharmed and we had to cast about 10 uncharm spells on the magicians<br/>\nto get him uncharmed *was really crazy*<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, im not complaining, no one died and i had my mm drum when i was<br/>\nlev21 or so. And 2 nights later my buddies bought the lute of gypsie<br/>\nprincess for 5pp from a guy in the zone. Too bad it doesnt do squat!<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n30th level bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tArwen [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tAugust 27, 1999 5:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Special Bard Instruments<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Arwen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have the mistmoor drums. I got them off  a castle train when I was about<br/>\n&gt; 32. My group was at the zone when we heard &quot;TRAIN! CHOO CHOO A COMING<br/>\n&gt; THROUGH&quot; We saw every imaginable creature at the zone..heh  I was charmed<br/>\n&gt; almost immediately and got to watch my friends slice me to bits (grin).<br/>\n&gt; Well<br/>\n&gt; they droppped me, they dropped the named gypsy..and they looted and ran.<br/>\n&gt; When I got back they presented me with my very own battledrums. Do I<br/>\n&gt; recommed going after her before your 40?..NO..but if you do..PLEASE  use<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; much magic resist as possible to save yourself from being charmed! Since<br/>\n&gt; mm<br/>\n&gt; castle trains (at least on MY server) are an ever occuring thing, one can<br/>\n&gt; concievabley camp the zone for the gypsy. Harmonic..I know what your<br/>\n&gt; thinking..NO I won&#39;t help you get them :) The offer for sol A still stands<br/>\n&gt; though  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elyana Silvanae<br/>\n&gt; Bardess of the 36th chorus<br/>\n&gt; Innorruk Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --&gt;I have been told that a named gypsy NPC drops the battle drum.  Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one myself but looking forward to it.  I have only been in Mistmoore 3-4<br/>\n&gt; &gt;times but on two of those occasions someone was auctioning the battle<br/>\n&gt; drum<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for 500PP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;BTW, one time someone pulled a train of the gypsies to the zone.  There<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;two regular gypsies and the named gypsy.  I had just zoned in.  There<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about 10 other players at the zone trying to fight them.  People started<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dropping like flies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That leads me to believe you need a group of 30+ players to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;survive against the gypsies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
