My L15 bard was<br/>\nvery slowly able to catch up to her.  The closing rate was<br/>\nslow enough that I&#39;m not sure if it was a difference between<br/>\nthe spell and song, or if she just had a slower machine than<br/>\nme (I have a friend with a slow machine and in just normal<br/>\nrunning I can slowly pass him).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m pretty sure Selo&#39;s Accelerando gets faster as you<br/>\ngain levels/skills.  There are two trees where I did some<br/>\nimpromptu timings when I was L8.  It took about 10.4 seconds<br/>\nfor me to run between them with Accelerando and a drum.  I<br/>\nrecently missed the boat by 5 seconds (when oh when will they<br/>\nadd a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock) so I went<br/>\nback to this spot to kill some time.  At L15, my bard took 9.7<br/>\nseconds to run between those two trees.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I suppose it&#39;s possible the druid was encumbered.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow anyone that&#39;s high level and can cast SoW to do a more<br/>\ncontrolled test.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
