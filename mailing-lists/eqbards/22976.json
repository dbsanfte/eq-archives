We were at his house doing a /who all &lt;class&gt; for each of the classes, and I saw that Bards and Rogues had the fewest.  Being a contrarian, I figured it would be cool to play one of the uncommon classes, and I&#39;d always been a Rogue/Thief in FTF gaming, so I figured I&#39;d try something a little different.  My Bard is my first character.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 55 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKhelan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Khelan, crying over his loss of speed<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
