Running back to your<br/>\ncorpse most people consider worthless downtime.  While a lower<br/>\nexperience loss may result in reaching level 50 more quickly,<br/>\nlong runs to your corpse decrease the percentage of your<br/>\n/played time that is spent actually playing the game (fighting<br/>\nmonsters).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
