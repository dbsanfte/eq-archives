I spent<br/>\nthe better part of an hour (my first hour ever in Sol B mind<br/>\nyou) finding a friend&#39;s corpse after he fell in in Sol A,<br/>\nzoned through to Sol B, and died.  We had no idea where in<br/>\nthat lava zone came out in Sol B, and I had to rely on the<br/>\nsong to figure out where his corpse was.  (I was not attacked<br/>\nthe entire time, and figured Sol B wasn&#39;t so bad so decided to<br/>\nplay there a bit, and problem died to a sonic bat train. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
