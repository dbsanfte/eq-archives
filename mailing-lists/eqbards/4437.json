My problem is that sure I can charm a critter,<br/>\nbut 5-20 seconds later, it is back wacking the &%^$ out of me!  So then I<br/>\ntry to continually &quot;recharm&quot; the creature, this works a little better, but I<br/>\nam still getting attacked by my &quot;pet&quot; about 25% of the time.  Am I doing<br/>\nsomething wrong? Is there a trick to it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other song I have problems with is Pixie Strike.  What real use is this<br/>\nsong?  You have to target the creature you want to strike, then NO ONE can<br/>\nhit it while it is in lala land, or it wakes up.  What this means is<br/>\neffectively to keep a monster out of the fight I have to keep it targeted<br/>\nand continually sing pixie strike at it, and not attack anything else.  Why<br/>\nnot use lullaby (aside from the obvious area effect dangers) and just have<br/>\neveryone in the party attack the same MOB?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease give me some direction on each of these, as I would love to use them<br/>\nmore!<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon, 33rd Rank Bard of Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n(Bardoon is of Gaelic origin meaning funeral dirge; a doleful song; funeral<br/>\nmarch)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
