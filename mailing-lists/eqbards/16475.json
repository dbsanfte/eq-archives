An afterthought that&#39;s<br/>\nnice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have when the real spells fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I get a strong idea that GZ&#39;s well ran dry on song ideas somewhere just<br/>\n&gt; after L20. Chains could have been a great song if it was _only_ a<br/>\n&gt; targetted mob combat speed reducer. That way it wouldn&#39;t conflict with<br/>\n&gt; snare and cause these headaches. Then he could have added another snare<br/>\n&gt; song as a seperate song, for those occasions when you don&#39;t have a druid<br/>\n&gt; or ranger. But no, GZ seems real big on these multiple action songs that<br/>\n&gt; get resisted more and also conflict more with other class&#39;s spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Same with the magic resist debuffs. A straight debuff would have been<br/>\n&gt; fine, but he had to add the dot which uses the same resist, so the songs<br/>\n&gt; become effectively useless. Having magic, fire, and cold debuff songs<br/>\n&gt; that tested on poison like tashan wouldn&#39;t have been that unbalancing or<br/>\n&gt; intruding on the classes that get debuffs, considering how little they<br/>\n&gt; debuff and the level the bard gets them at, but instead we got 3 songs<br/>\n&gt; that no one ever uses.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
