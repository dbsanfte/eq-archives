I wonder where that mis-info came<br/>\nfrom...<br/>\n- We have YET to charge monthly dues, mostly because everyone contributes<br/>\nfreely and willingly to the guild treasury out of a generous spirit.<br/>\n- The entry fee is relatively tiny. We will NEVER pay for our guild hall 10p<br/>\nat a time, and it doesn&#39;t go very far to providing services to new members.<br/>\nIt&#39;s mostly a barrier of entry so that we know a new member is relatively<br/>\ninterested in being part of the guild. I should state further that the REAL<br/>\nbarrier of entry to The Soerbaird is in some duties a new student must<br/>\nperform. All of this can be found on the web site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Soerbaird is not just a guild of cronies, and we seldom group together<br/>\nto &quot;level&quot;. We are a guild of writers, performers and contributors to the<br/>\ncitizenry of Norrath. We aren&#39;t out there to provide a resource or directive<br/>\nto other bards either. Because we aren&#39;t a gamer&#39;s guild, we don&#39;t have a<br/>\nlarge number of members. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Soerbaird isn&#39;t for everyone, and because of our entry requirements (the<br/>\nnon-financial ones), we tend to scare off the faint of heart - which is a<br/>\ngood thing. We have an agenda, which is narrow and focused, and we try not<br/>\nto be sidetracked too much by the competitive aspects (gaming) of Norrath.<br/>\nOur desire is to be the elite performers and historians of Norrath, and we<br/>\nwelcome anyone who passionately desires to be part of that effort. And I do<br/>\nmean ANYONE. Not all of us are &quot;great writers&quot;. Many of us are learning from<br/>\neach other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I should point out that the majority of the members have a very<br/>\ngenerous spirit. Example: (OOC) Recently, I had a corrupted player file<br/>\nwhich pretty much destroyed me (and my equipment). I had to delete Dendall<br/>\nand start over again (arrgg!). Once I had leveled back up to about 9th, my<br/>\nfellows re-equipped me with about 80% of what I previously had - without me<br/>\neven asking. I also took out a loan from our guild treasury - which I am<br/>\nrepaying with interest. This is something made possible by guild entry fees.<br/>\nWe have, from time to time, offered student loans to those interested in<br/>\nstarting a trade skill. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Dendall, Ollave of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dan Bouchard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbouch@...\">dbouch@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSoerbaird - I understand we have a member participating in this chain. I<br/>\nlove the idea behind your guild and I was actually considering applying,<br/>\nhowever I don&#39;t understand why so much money is required to be a member.<br/>\nCorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, isn&#39;t it somewhere along the lines of 100pp to join<br/>\nand a monthly fee besides? I am an officer in the largest and arguably<br/>\noldest online gaming guild (The Syndicate www.thesyndicate.org ) and we<br/>\ndon;t charge our members any fees. Understandably if Verant implements Guild<br/>\nhousing we will require fees to help fund a guild house, but currently there<br/>\nis no reason to collect from our members, unless of course you&#39;re doing it<br/>\nfor &quot;future necessities&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
