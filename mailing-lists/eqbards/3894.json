So back to the topic (and excuse me if this post have allready been<br/>\nreplied to, but Im reciving in digest form).<br/>\nI am pretty sure that you DO move slower in different kinds of envoriment,<br/>\njust try moving on to the sand in east commons or the ice (frozen rivers)<br/>\nin Everfrost the sand will slow you down and the ice will have a slippery<br/>\nfeel to it?<br/>\nSo from my experince its not zones that are slower but the materials you<br/>\nrun on, makes sence in my oppion. Ohh and you seem to loose vigor faster<br/>\ntoo when running/walking in high snow or sand.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker 18th level bard, Bertoxullus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n____<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 24<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 17 Jul 1999 00:44:46 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Daniel P.
