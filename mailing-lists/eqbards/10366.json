I was grouped with a level 19 Wizard and we were just North<br/>\nof the W.Karana zone on the path.  I was using Selo&#39;s, Bellow and CoD when I<br/>\nran too close to a house &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;  I do know that griffawns<br/>\nhave double attack and I don&#39;t think solo kiting is really even possible<br/>\ntill we get Chains.  It&#39;s been very painful everytime I&#39;ve gotten mixed up<br/>\nwith a griff, although I&#39;ve never died thanks to Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious about other bards success kiting with level 20 and under songs.<br/>\nHow do you balance running out of range for such a long kite if your only<br/>\nbellowing?  And if your using CoD or DDD how much success do you have<br/>\nkeeping from attracting other mobs and instakill NPC&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter how useful is Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and does anyone<br/>\nactually use it?  Having just gotten level 20 I&#39;ve started using Anthem,<br/>\nHymn, Largo&#39;s, Bellow or Denons.  I mainly group because soloing pre-20 in<br/>\nS.Karana gave me a lot of exercise in running to the zone :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLakosh  ?  &lt;Divine Harmony&gt;<br/>\nFresh level 20 Bard of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Thats actually one of the more<br/>\n&gt; important ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15 (just<br/>\n&gt; got 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; selos/bellow/bellow (using strings).  Any help is appreciated...oh, anyone<br/>\n&gt; know if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run the<br/>\n&gt; same speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>\n&gt; sorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again,<br/>\n&gt; Taluvil<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 19, 1999 5:46 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] DoT/DD/Hymn equations<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;With Lute (why sing it without?) it&#39;s 4hp +2 for every 6 levels of exp.<br/>\n&gt; So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;at 6th level it&#39;s doing 6 hp per pulse and 12th level it&#39;s 8 hp per<br/>\npulse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(sitting).  The weird part is that at 24th level I started doing 13 hp<br/>\n&gt; per<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pulse and 11 sitting down (the difference used to be just one between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sitting and standing) so I that seems to blow the formula but that&#39;s<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I always heard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I often sing it while smacking away in combat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are confused a bit mixing in the natural regen rate here.  At 12 you<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn plus<br/>\n2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; natural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from Hymn<br/>\n&gt; plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th level,<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere<br/>\nsoon<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or after 20th.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Using my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn should<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.<br/>\nAt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual result<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the equation is correct.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d get<br/>\n&gt; two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;from just sitting without the song) and it improves 2 hp per pulse<br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt; &gt; six<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;levels after.  This is not dependent on string skill level because I<br/>\nhear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;keeps going up even after we&#39;ve maxed string.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Same as you get with my equation, Hymn does 4pt at 6th, plus the 2 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sitting = 6.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
