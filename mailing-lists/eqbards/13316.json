I imagine the other Bard was one of the one&#39;s on the<br/>\nsteps?  (I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call it an exploit, tho, since I believe the word<br/>\n&quot;exploit&quot; implies &quot;intent&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unfortunate that Verant can&#39;t fix this pathing bug, even though they&#39;ve<br/>\nknown of it for a long time now.  It does make it impossible to fight in the<br/>\ntemple if attacked without exploiting unless every member of your group<br/>\nstands within melee range.  Obviously this is impractical.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\ncamped with a group in the halls for this reason alone.  Pulling to the<br/>\nbottom or pulling to the top seem to be the only ways around this.  It&#39;s the<br/>\nplayers who knowingly camp the halls and abuse the bug that bother me.  1<br/>\nwizard and 1 mage (w/o pet) standing in the corner nuking a mob standing on<br/>\nthe stairs are definately &quot;knowingly&quot; using the exploit.  3 tanks engaging a<br/>\nmob in the hallway and 1 cleric standing behind are technically exploiting<br/>\nin that the cleric could never possibly be attacked, but may not be<br/>\nknowingly abusing the bug.  While they might wonder why the cleric is not<br/>\ngetting attacked, if it was their first time there, they would really have<br/>\nno way of knowing.  This is the reason I jumped in this thread in the first<br/>\nplace.  To educate anyone who did not know of this bug, so they would know<br/>\nwhat they were doing if and when the situation came up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m the one who started this thread when I told my story about using<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lullaby<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to put 10 mobs to sleep while my group was fighting on the steps at the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>top<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the pyramid.
