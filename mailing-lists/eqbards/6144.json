So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>\n&gt; bard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as much<br/>\n&gt; research into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game as a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce your<br/>\n&gt; wife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you develop<br/>\n&gt; your skills more fully.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>\n&gt; level 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My guess<br/>\n&gt; is that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>\n&gt; level 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs and<br/>\n&gt; instruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>\n&gt; crossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>\nwill happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>\nupgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>\nL48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbeat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>\ncome close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>\nsee. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>\nparty buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>\nwhich is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>\ndamage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when I&#39;m in a bad mood I think that if it wasn&#39;t for the mana<br/>\nsong, Bards would be lower on the list for getting in a group than a<br/>\nrogue in most people&#39;s eyes.
