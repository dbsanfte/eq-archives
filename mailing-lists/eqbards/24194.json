How would you change it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe problem is, i think these are bogus reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this is valid if you are charming.  it seems like most bards don&#39;t charm in<br/>\ngroups with<br/>\nan enchanter, so that makes this only valid in non enchanter groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>recast is not an issue since you can swap it out whenever you don&#39;t have<br/>\nenough<br/>\nmana to cast it and swap it back in when you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the mob <br/>\n&gt;scaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it may be pitiful, but so is bard melee.  does that mean you don&#39;t melee at<br/>\nall?<br/>\nit may not be the be all end all of all damage songs or spells, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat there is no place for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;It&#39;s AE, and I&#39;d NEVER use an AE song.. The Chanter would kill me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this is just so wrong on so many levels that it would take a whole other<br/>\npost to address<br/>\nthis.  for the sake of brevity, i&#39;ll just point to my earlier posts where i<br/>\npointed out when an<br/>\nexcellent time to use this song was, which wouldn&#39;t mess up the enchanter at<br/>\nall and would<br/>\ndo a significant amount of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, my question is... &quot;What would have to change in order to justify <br/>\n&gt;memming this song?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>\n&gt;plays from 43 to 60.  I&#39;m talking about it becoming useful.. <br/>\n&gt;occasionally, every once in awhile, rarely... something more than NOT <br/>\n&gt;EVER.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sorry, maybe i misinterpreted your 90% statement then, my bad.  i originally<br/>\nthought you <br/>\nmeant that 90% of the time, bards would be using it.  but maybe you meant<br/>\nthat 90% of<br/>\nthe bards would use it once in a while.  in that case, i think it has it&#39;s<br/>\nuses once in a while<br/>\nif you use it correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Darkfox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
