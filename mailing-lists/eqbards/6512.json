I would also venture an assumption that just<br/>\nabout every other class in the game would also agree that it makes sense.  Since<br/>\nVerant has already done it with Levitate, it should be easy to include a fix for<br/>\nSelos.  Perhaps we should give Verant some time to work out the kinks with the<br/>\nnew patch.  I think the best course of action at this point is to go to the<br/>\nalt.games.everquest newsgroup and support Faras&#39; post on this subject.  Brad<br/>\ndoes read them so maybe we won&#39;t have to resort to a petition.  If it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget fixed in a couple of weeks then we can take more formal measures if enough<br/>\npeople think it is warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (who needs to get to work but the number of posts today wont let<br/>\nhim)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In some ways it sucks that SoW overrides Selo&#39;s, but at least I no<br/>\n&gt; longer have to worry about braking a party member&#39;s SoW when cranking<br/>\n&gt; up the song.  Ideally, songs such as Selo&#39;s, Water Breathing, and Aria<br/>\n&gt; of Eagles would temporarily override the spell equivalents when in<br/>\n&gt; effect, and then the spell effects would continue to have their effect<br/>\n&gt; once we stop singing.  However, I&#39;m not holding my breath.  At the<br/>\n&gt; very least, I think we should ask for the ability to be able to turn<br/>\n&gt; off our own SoW effect, just as you can supposedly cancel your own<br/>\n&gt; levitation now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Purna Hodari of Quellious<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
