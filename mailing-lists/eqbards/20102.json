I am grouped with a ranger 90% of the time as they and a<br/>\nmonk are our guild&#39;s only tanks. (our warrior recently quit EQ sadly)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack speedup songs are pointless as the &#39;chanter Alacrity&#39;s all the tanks<br/>\nand that&#39;s better than any speedups I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains is useless unless I want to break the ranger&#39;s snares.  Or the other<br/>\nranger&#39;s, or the druid&#39;s, or the other druid&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to the same problem really.  A bard is an awesome way to<br/>\nmake up for the lack of having a particular type of caster in your group<br/>\nwhatever that missing type might be.  If you have all the major types<br/>\ncovered though, we look like lousy psuedo-tanks with some interesting<br/>\nsecondary abilities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt goes back to my previous bard complaint from way back, being a third rate<br/>\neverything does not necessarily balance out with being best at something.<br/>\nIf there was a better balance between casters and melee classes in EQ we<br/>\nwould instantly become more useful as any given group would be more likely<br/>\nto be missing some type they needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen was the last time you entered a zone to see shouts of &quot;Bard wanted for<br/>\ngroup&quot;?<br/>\nI&#39;d answer never.  Every time I play I see &quot;Cleric needed for group&quot;, or<br/>\n&quot;Enchanter needed for group&quot;, or &quot;2 Tanks needed for group&quot;.  I may not get<br/>\nrefused by groups but the first question is always &quot;Do you have manasong?&quot;<br/>\n(I play Anon)  The response is always &quot;Oh.  Darn&quot;.  If Lullaby worked even<br/>\nmarginally I&#39;d start ansewring those &quot;enchanter wanted&quot; shouts and see if<br/>\nthey were really &quot;Clarity wanted&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
