Nice work John(tm)!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad my short lived burst of speed gave you the inspiration - or at<br/>\nleast added to it to &#39;beat me to 50&quot; - Grats!!  I keep thinking &lt;boo hoo&gt;<br/>\nspectres are green now - nobody will take me to the SS room - I will never<br/>\nmake 50.  Hmm maybe i should go to Guk and see what John(tm) was able to<br/>\nsolo.  but then I remember that almost every post where you mention solo in<br/>\nthe maze on the live side is followed with tips on fear / invis running to<br/>\nthe zone &lt;grin&gt;  Pass.  But I do believe that I can solo blue DW gobs.  Me<br/>\nand a necro were taking them with ease.  Otherwise it looks like Seafurys<br/>\nand Everlost Ice (frost? they drop frost giant toes) giants for the<br/>\nremaining bubs. Bouncers are green, kobs are green, specs are green &lt;gah&gt;<br/>\nWe even mounted an expedition to the perma bear caves in search of blue<br/>\nmobs.  Heh, we found em. Try 6 blue bears agro early because someones invis<br/>\ndrops.  Thank god we had 2 enchanters cuz one died.  Oh yeah, you need a<br/>\nlive gater to get out.  Yes, you can climb the ladder and kill the 2 IG&#39;s<br/>\nand the Dragon if she is up and run out thru the lair but gating is easier.<br/>\nAll in all it was very fun to do some thing that was a risk, and new, and<br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought you or someone would catch that &lt;g&gt; I dont use it in &#39;normal&#39;<br/>\nfights in Hate or other multiple mob pulls.  But I knew Inny would be all<br/>\nalone and I wanted to see if I could get it to stick on him.  It didn&#39;t.<br/>\nAlso, I was guessing I would be playing the hymn and niv&#39;s late in the fight<br/>\nand thought maybe string enhancements and all... well I should have used<br/>\nChords of Dischord &lt;g&gt;.  It would be bad to have Inny die to the DoT bug and<br/>\nsee his corpse poof.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. overheard in the bear caves...<br/>\n<br/>\nRaloon tells the group, &quot;No offense but I really hate bards.&quot;<br/>\nDunk tells the group, &quot;why?&quot;<br/>\nRaloon tells the group, &quot;damn bard song drops invis just as i run off to<br/>\nhave a look&quot;<br/>\nSylly tells the group, &quot;No offense but i really hate enchanters who dont say<br/>\nSTOP SONG before the cast invis on thenselves and go running around &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBah, I really hate having a puller or &#39;go looker&#39; in the group &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 27 Mar 2000, Sylly Songsynger wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bardette of 48 songs (Saturday - ice giants for 2 bubs; Sun more ice<br/>\n </span></blockquote>giants<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Doh.
