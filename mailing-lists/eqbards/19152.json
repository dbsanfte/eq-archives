In addition, your cleric cannot see<br/>\nperson number 7, or if they are person number seven, they cannot see the<br/>\nrest of the group.  Bard songs do hit the seventh person, though.  It<br/>\nused to be that the seventh person got solo exp for the kill--too bad<br/>\nthey fixed that one :)<br/>\n<br/>\nA great use for this is for porting for raids--one wizzy, seven-grouping,<br/>\nand /qing managed to get all of us up to Hate last night in three groups<br/>\ninstead of four, saving some money and time on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n(OT) Being on my first ever raid I was a little surprised.  Is there<br/>\nusually a one piece of cleric armor dropped for each of the non-cleric<br/>\nones?  We had four or five pieces, and three of those eight hours we did<br/>\nnot kill a single cleric--as opposed to one shammy, one warrior, one<br/>\npally, and one bard (last kill of the night gave me gloves, woohoo!).  We<br/>\nprobably ended up killing more spite golems than clerics.  We actually<br/>\nhad a set of cleric arms rot because all three clerics had them *and* a<br/>\nbackup pair, and did not want a third. Sorry for wandering so far<br/>\noff-topic, I am just still psyched about how well the raid went, forgive<br/>\nme ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nwww.freespeech.org/karisma/intro.html<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
