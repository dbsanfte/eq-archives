Brad leaves out the Charm nerf for levels over<br/>\n35<br/>\n&gt; and the nerfing of Accelerando, which GZ himself admitted was a nerf, not<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; bug fix, and you think Brad&#39;s on target?  How about the reduction to our<br/>\n&gt; DoT&#39;s? another minus.  That&#39;s three big minuses in like 30 seconds, and<br/>\nBrad<br/>\n&gt; got other developers input on his list?

You are<br/>\n&gt; mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic<br/>\n&gt; gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks<br/>\n&gt; about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or<br/>\n&gt; songs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic<br/>\n&gt; instrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Adon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
