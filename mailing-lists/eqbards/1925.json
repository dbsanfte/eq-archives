But in your case it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have made a difference since bard song effects last<br/>\nfor two pulses after you stop singing.  You would&#39;ve been<br/>\nknocked unconscious, the next pulse would&#39;ve revived you, and<br/>\nyou would&#39;ve zoned safely.  In a (rare) situation like Roop,<br/>\nwhere the song and poison battle it out for several pulses,<br/>\nthat IMHO should be /bugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother benefit you may not realize about the song is that it<br/>\nstops bleeding.  When you&#39;re knocked unconcious, you usually<br/>\nget a message that you are bleeding to death.  Unless someone<br/>\nheals you or bandages you, you will continue to lose hp and<br/>\ndie even if the monster whacking on you is killed before it<br/>\ncan hit you again.  Yet another reason to have a bard in the<br/>\nparty.  :-)  I carry bandages as well for the rare occasions<br/>\nwhere this happens to someone not in my party (lesson learned<br/>\nafter I saved an unconcious person from a monster, then could<br/>\ndo nothing but watch as he bled to death).  Saved someone&#39;s<br/>\nlife with them just today.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
