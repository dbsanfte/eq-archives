Veeshan had a very good leader who led the raids weekly<br/>\nfor months, when he gave it up (got too high), no one stepped up and the<br/>\nband of dragon slayers disbanded.  Now its often a collection of idiots and<br/>\nmunchkins who gather for the dragon slaying.  Loot is frequently ninjaed and<br/>\nthe raid often takes up to 5 hours!  I decided I&#39;d either buy a scale or<br/>\nwait till my guild can kill Gone...<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 55 Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
