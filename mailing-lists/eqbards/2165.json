But it could also be a really cheap way of killing tough<br/>\n&gt;stuff:<br/>\n&gt;Fire up Aquatic, hit Selo&#39;s, whack a red mob and leap into Lake Rathe. Then<br/>\n&gt;you swim down, way way deep, twisting the two songs. Even if the mob&#39;s AI<br/>\n&gt;tells it to go get some air once it starts taking drowning damage it&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt;too deep to make it to the surface.<br/>\n&gt;Actually... come to think of it I don&#39;t believe you get xp when mobs die of<br/>\n&gt;&quot;natural causes&quot; IE: NPC&#39;s killing them, drowning and maybe falling.<br/>\n&gt;Cuz then with safe-fall, we (or those odd, always vicious, monks) could<br/>\n&gt;drag minos up to the top of the wall in the Gorge and jump off until they<br/>\n&gt;go splat.<br/>\n&gt;Ah well, they&#39;ve found a way to defeat all of my cheapness thus far, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think that&#39;ll change ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of which: I&#39;m finding Mistmoore to be great as of lvl 21+. I think<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s a sweetspot for me right now as my xp is zooming up nicely and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;actually quite fun, regardless of the repetitive nature of what I do there.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m pretty settled in the belief that I need to do that for a few more<br/>\n&gt;levels until I&#39;m tough enough to wander around Guk and Cazic (sp?). I think<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been everywhere, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong: is there anywhere<br/>\n&gt;else that&#39;s good to us at the lvl 21-24 range sort of thing? I feel I might<br/>\n&gt;sicken of Mistmoore sometime this week... once I start venturing in beyond<br/>\n&gt;the graveyard. I&#39;ll die tons, get frustrated and spend another 3 days<br/>\n&gt;wandering from one end of Norrath to the other, just... being a bard, I<br/>\n&gt;guess ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s not too bad, usually, but I just wanna get good xp for the time<br/>\n&gt;being - I&#39;m really keen on seeing places I barely know. (Happened to wander<br/>\n&gt;into Nagfen&#39;s yaddayadda (can&#39;t remember the name), in Lavastorm the other<br/>\n&gt;day (and it&#39;s *not* Najena) but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going there for<br/>\n&gt;another 2 or 3 months ;) So if anyone knows of an alternate to Mistmoore -<br/>\n&gt;as a backup for when the tedium starts setting in for me in MM please do<br/>\n&gt;tell, I&#39;d love to know.<br/>\n&gt;Dud<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Fun Bob [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Saturday, June 19, 1999 6:00 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Lake Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of drowing, does anyone else think that certain monsters other<br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt;Aqua-Goblins and such should only have a limited amount of time they can<br/>\n&gt;spend underwater before they drown?
