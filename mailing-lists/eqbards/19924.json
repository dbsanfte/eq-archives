Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>\n&gt; conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>\n&gt; from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; heard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>\n&gt; on:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>\n&gt; their items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>\n&gt; stinks nonetheless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; SALESFORCE.COM MAKES SOFTWARE OBSOLETE<br/>\n&gt; Secure, online sales force automation with 5 users FREE for 1 year!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2658/13/_/451022/_/961592720/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2658/13/_/451022/_/961592720/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
