It&#39;s been<br/>\nabout 10 levels now since I really felt comfortable grouping with an<br/>\nenchanter.  I used Siren&#39;s last night in a group and it was pretty<br/>\neffective.  The necromancer was laughing pretty hard at the antics of &#39;My&#39;<br/>\nwar boned skeleton.  He was very jealous of &#39;My&#39; skeletons superior sitting<br/>\nskills, heh heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n\tFull time pain-in-the-keister, part time Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very common for me to be grouped with an enchanter.  In fact, an<br/>\nenchanter, bard, and monk are the core of our 6 person Fire Giant runs (WAY<br/>\nfun).  We also add a shaman, a cleric, and the 6th has been a paladin<br/>\n(because<br/>\nhe&#39;s my game husband hehe) but that is the spot to put another class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, one group, or the core group for a larger Sebilis raid, almost<br/>\nalways has a bard and an enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bard is needed to cut the down time.  I agree with Lyrnia ( believe it<br/>\nwas<br/>\nher) that our strength lies there.  But I have pulled in Sebilis, done crowd<br/>\ncontrol, been battle bard...just adapted to the conditions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
