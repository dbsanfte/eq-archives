ANYTHING out here to get us off bards and<br/>\nmelee:<br/>\n<br/>\nA GM last night on Veeshan dropped the hint that the blued two-handed<br/>\nwarhammer&#39;s quest involving turning in the 4 crystal staves to someone *was*<br/>\nworking (as opposed to the cries of &quot;its broken&quot; that near deafened me in<br/>\nNajena a few nights ago)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we bards being the keepers of lore, does anyone know who exactly we turn<br/>\nthem in to?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my knowledge the Slime Crystal Staff pop&#39;s on King Xrob in<br/>\nthe gorge, the Ice Crystal Staff comes from Permafrost (imagine that), but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know on who, the Water Crystal Staff is on a named aqua goblin,<br/>\nWebclaw, in Lake Rathe and the last one, the Fire Crystal Staff, I have no<br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a slime crystal staff right now just because I like the look even if<br/>\nthe proc is resisted far too often...  At any rate, this appears to be one<br/>\nquest were the reward is worth the effort so I&#39;d like to do it before Verant<br/>\nfinds out and changes it to a Rusty Red Three-Handed Skirmish Stick. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Scummy & Sicarius @ Veeshan&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
