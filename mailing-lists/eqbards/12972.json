In an outdoor<br/>\nzone you have your speed song, which should prevent amost ANY death.<br/>\nIndoors, if you cannot find a spot near the zone to fight at, then<br/>\nmake sure you group with a wizard or a druid thats knows how to evac.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general rule is ANYONE in the group can call for an <br/>\nevac, and the evac&#39;er immediately and without questioning would evac.<br/>\nFigure out later if it was the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you have a balanced group.<br/>\nClerics have about 7x the healing power of druids/shamans.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a cleric in the group, play &quot;less efficiently&quot;<br/>\nso that you do not attract attention, if this means just bellowing<br/>\nstraight, then do it and don&#39;t worry about it.  A dead bard is of<br/>\nno help to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nA warrior is the best taunting melee in the game.  A rogue BS does<br/>\ngood...when it does good damage.  A monk is fair, when he gets a lucky<br/>\nround of hits..A warrior just flat taunts.  If you don&#39;t have one of<br/>\nthese -- be more careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers/Druids/Shamans usually think of healing as a secondary priority.<br/>\nPaladins that stand around after combat also think of any<br/>\nheals they have as extra&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch your group, watch the spells being cast.  If the druid is<br/>\nputting Damage shield up every fight on both himself and the<br/>\nmain tank, and casting the swarm and snare, he likely isn&#39;t<br/>\nsaving mana to do major healing.  If the shaman is keeping<br/>\nspeed buffs up on everyone and casting dex/agi buffs all<br/>\naround, he isn&#39;t saving for major healing either.  If the cleric,<br/>\nthinks smite is the best form of DD in the game (run!) then<br/>\num, no healing there either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you join a group with a druid/cleric and they do not immediately<br/>\ncast skin like xxx or bravery/valor/resolution on everyone ...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any single fight, &quot;normal&quot; fight takes the group over half way<br/>\ndown in hp and mana, that is too hard of a source of experience,<br/>\nand you are going to find yourself dieing a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all of these statements are true, but they give you some<br/>\nthoughts on how to &quot;read&quot; a pickup group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI died 7 times from level 29 to level 50, it can be done.<br/>\n(I died 7 times last night breaking the plane of fear)<br/>\n<br/>\nRazzan<br/>\n50/49 Wizard posting on the wrong damn list again<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>\n&gt; run  sll the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>\n&gt; aswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp. To be<br/>\n&gt; honest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>\n&gt; every level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>\n&gt; have now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>\n&gt; die, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>\n&gt; levels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I enjoy playing my bard and have got to level 33 through alot of hard work,<br/>\n&gt; I have great equipment for my level and am VERY keen to get to level 40+<br/>\n&gt; but I jus can&#39;t see it happening, I don&#39;t know how you level 40+ bards on<br/>\n&gt; this list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>\n&gt; think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>\n&gt; asked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; said that I find it very hard not to die, he replied &quot;Trust me, Bards got<br/>\n&gt; the bad deal&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 33 Songs &lt;Lords of Chaos&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meklon, Level 7 Cleric of Innurok &lt;Lords of chaos&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>\n&gt; problem is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when<br/>\n&gt; I play<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>\n&gt; turns bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>\n&gt; away,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>\n&gt; casters<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back<br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;zone they died in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs<br/>\n&gt; personal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;welfare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; The information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\n&gt; intended for the addressee only.
