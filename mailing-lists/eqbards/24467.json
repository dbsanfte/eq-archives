I&#39;m about 90 percent sure that doing Chants I&#39;ve never been<br/>\nsummoned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the same experience with Gorenaire that Darkfox had in the early days<br/>\nof Velious when one of the Xegony larger guilds had unsuccessfully attacked<br/>\nGorenaire.

The creature just has to have been damaged.  I tested this<br/>\nrecently with another Bard while testing out some theories on beating<br/>\nGorenaire. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means, tho, is that if someone trains you with their half<br/>\ndead mob, you may have a hard time getting away.  Good thing is, it<br/>\nwill probably require them being summoned and killed first, before<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be at the top of the Hate list. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
