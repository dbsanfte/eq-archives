One has nothing to do with the other. People who put forth similar<br/>\neffort should reap similar reward. Does that mean that the guy who plays 15<br/>\nhours a day will get his armor before the guy who plays 10 hours per week?<br/>\nProbably. Should it be any different? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some people talk about wanting us to put up a &quot;Casual Gamers&quot;<br/>\nserver. They have different ideas about how to go about this, but the end<br/>\nresult is a server where it&#39;s about 5 times easier to advance and obtain<br/>\nitems in roughly a quarter of the time. We will *not* be doing anything like<br/>\nthis. Part of what makes EverQuest what it is is the difficulty and<br/>\nchallenge involved in advancing in the game. Making a server where we<br/>\npurposely trivialize this challenge would go against everything we believe<br/>\nabout these games.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 08, 2000 2:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] A rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately the answer to your problem is not going to make you happy.<br/>\n&gt; Abashi responded to a similar question today.
