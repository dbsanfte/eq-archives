The most fun lately I&#39;ve had is with my bard, killing<br/>\n&gt; stuff in Lake of Ill Omen with pickup groups...

I have reached that stage in EQ where you get kinda<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;bitter&quot; about some things.  I dont think I have it as bad as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some others I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know - and I still keep playing.  But....(and these are my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; feelings - imho,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ymmv, yadda yadda)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. There is a strong &quot;Us vs Them&quot; atmosphere in EQ. Us being <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Vision(tm)&quot; and the &quot;You have been summoned by the Gods (who <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in r/l maybe a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some volunteer with little or no customer service <br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp/training and a short<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fuse)&quot; and the Them being the players (who are probably <br/>\n&gt; &gt; lying, cheating,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coniving, theiving baistiages or else why would they be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; asking for a res /<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item that got lost doing a quest / help finding a corpse / <br/>\n&gt; &gt; return of items<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from rotted corpse when printed user manual has incorrect <br/>\n&gt; &gt; times for corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decay / etc etc.).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Advancement in the game is based on &quot;time served&quot; 10 times <br/>\n&gt; &gt; more than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;skilled play.&quot;  And this makes 80 to 90 percent of the game <br/>\n&gt; &gt; very boring.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Only new places offer some relief and granted the design of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; them has gotten<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better - still after doing Seb Crypt 10 times - it gets <br/>\n&gt; &gt; boring.  Camping for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp is flat out boring.  How many hows killing aviaks / pickclaws /<br/>\n&gt; &gt; froogluks / kobolds / guards / etc. etc. can you stand?  This <br/>\n&gt; &gt; may be due to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting &quot;npc&#39;s&quot; rather than live ppl where each fight is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dynamic. So, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; basis of the game maybe just boring because any AI in the NPC&#39;s is so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; limited - and repetitive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. The &quot;content&quot; based events/quests/lore & history has been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; skimpy at best.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Granted, it&#39;s very difficult to provide RolePlay Lore when <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there are so many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Duuuudz who wanna kill it and loot it.  But where is the incentive for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; players to do otherwise? Where are the tools to facilitate GM <br/>\n&gt; &gt; events? And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they may not have the resources to make dynamic events <br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually work - ie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why bother if there is no money in it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, any how - I had a great year in the game.  The part i <br/>\n&gt; &gt; love the best is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other players.  I know there are a couple others who play <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;live in the world&quot; (Silky? Peace? Sylly? oh that&#39;s me!) and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there is fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff there.  I have had as much fun taking &quot;newbies&quot; in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rivervale to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sheriff, levitating and running to the rocks so we can climb <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the top of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the mountains - as I have had doing dragons and planes.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe more fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, for the younger bards reading this, take your time and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; play the way you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like.  There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the quest for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; All you have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; long haul but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually you get there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Minstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kevin L.
