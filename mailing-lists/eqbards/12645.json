The problem is, <br/>\n&gt; leveling generally is<br/>\n&gt; boring.  I get bored trying to stay in one place for long, <br/>\n&gt; much less at one<br/>\n&gt; camp.  Whenever I see that someone stayed in the Highkeep <br/>\n&gt; basement for 3<br/>\n&gt; levels or is Cazic for 5 levels, I get that sick feeling in <br/>\n&gt; the pit of my<br/>\n&gt; stomach.  If that&#39;s what it takes to level beyond 25 I never <br/>\n&gt; will.  Doing<br/>\n&gt; those things is not fun for me in the least, and if the game <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t fun I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t play, pure and simple.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
