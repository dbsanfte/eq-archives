I play a very poor gnome<br/>\nenchanter (less than 1 plat most days because of trying to buy his 12th<br/>\nlevel spells).  I sit near the gate in Freeport /shouting things like &quot;Poor<br/>\ngnarled gnome binding for donations&quot;, while I meditate, which immediately<br/>\ngets followed by someone else shouting &quot;Binding for free!&quot;  So, there is no<br/>\neconomy as long as people give things away or donations are not given.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Bind anywhere?  Never happen.

Let me tell you, that was one long walk.<br/>\nSo was I supposed to abandon the group for who knows how long (this is 4am<br/>\nEST, btw), hoping to get a bind closer?  If NPCs had bind, and I could go<br/>\nthere great.  They still wouldn&#39;t be able to bind me at (for example) the<br/>\nlesser faydark zone point (like PC casters can).  The economy wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nbroken.  Heck - once the first person gave it away for free, it already<br/>\nwas.  Do you guys remember when it was &quot;Binding for 2pp&quot; instead of<br/>\n&quot;donations&quot;??  That&#39;s a case of the economy being broken by uncaring casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
