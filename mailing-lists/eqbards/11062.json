I use levitate to help move across the terrain.<br/>\n&gt; Floating above the water, killing spectres my levitate begins to fade.<br/>\n&gt; I recast, and get the &quot;You are already floating&quot; message.  Now I have<br/>\n&gt; a couple options, run up to the spectre island to recast, which has<br/>\n&gt; the chance of drawing more spectres to me, or run back across the<br/>\n&gt; water to recast.  Standing over a lava pit when levitate starts to fade?<br/>\n&gt; Running across the ocean of tears and levitate fades?  Swim to an<br/>\n&gt; island.  The problem with the bard will be fixed, other<br/>\n&gt; classes have been nerfed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My levitate lasts just over 15 minutes, so when my leader is pulling<br/>\n&gt; cyclops for us, I like to keep levitate up on him so he can pull<br/>\n&gt; better.  Now levitate has to be out before I can recast, or I have<br/>\n&gt; to tell him to drop it, then wait for him to respond, then recast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They have definitely found a very rude way to fix a very small problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have heard that the same problem exists with enduring breath also,<br/>\n&gt; which I haven&#39;t been able to verify.  Can you imagine having this<br/>\n&gt; go out in Kedge?  You would have to recast aftr it fades while you are<br/>\n&gt; running out of breath, how fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes it is broken for all classes, but... The other classes still have<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; usuable spell, while our song is completely worthless till they fix<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
