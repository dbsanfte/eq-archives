The effectiveness<br/>\nof the Lament was drastically reduced a couple of patches ago. I stopped<br/>\nusing it then, as it became less than useful on the mobs I was fighting<br/>\nat the time. Maybe it&#39;s been reduced in effectiveness even more in the<br/>\nmost recent patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few more silent changes I&#39;ve found that you may find dismaying. The<br/>\nserrated bone dirk, formerly usable by bards, is now not. Same with the<br/>\nBlack Enamored Chest (actually I think that&#39;s supposed to be black<br/>\nenamaled and eq&#39;lizer has it spelled wrong but I&#39;d have to wait until I<br/>\nget in game and check with our cleric to be sure), which is now wearable<br/>\nby every plate wearing class but the bard. I&#39;ve also heard but haven&#39;t<br/>\nyet confirmed, that the Mithril chest plate is also not wearable by<br/>\nbards. It looks like we have effectively been turned into honorary chain<br/>\nwearers in terms of magic armor, in that Rubicite so far is the only<br/>\narmor other than steel and bronze that we can actually wear.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
