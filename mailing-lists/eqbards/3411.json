If not, get one asap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you get too old - the raider camp on the river in North Karana just a<br/>\nbit east of the bridge to South K.  Lots of them there - so take a big party<br/>\nin case you pull all of them at one time.  At 14 I was getting green and<br/>\nblue cons.  My 16 friends hardly take the trouble to avoid them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a co level friend, 13 & 14, you should have fun on the scareycrows on<br/>\nthe Miller farm in southern West Karanas.   Also, kill off the WK bandits<br/>\nbefore they become green trash.  They have bronze weps for loots to sell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you should be able to take on stuff in the Gorge of King Xorbb -<br/>\nmuddie minors then elders  and gorge minos - with a friend or two to help.<br/>\nI chinged into 15 there yesterday - me and an 18 wizard I met on the<br/>\nplatform.  He said he could take out anything in the place - I trusted him<br/>\nfor a while but was pretty nervous. We really had no trouble except finding<br/>\nenough stuff to fight.  By 15 you will be wondering why you bothered to run<br/>\non the walls in that place and how come the spawn rate is so slow.  Of<br/>\ncourse a couple of hard whacks from these beasties will help you remember<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of the gorge in East Karana, turn right and just up over some hills<br/>\nis a fun little village with shops and even a guard - although he is lazy<br/>\nand won&#39;t attack all of the monsters. But the traffic pattern is pretty high<br/>\nand you can run out and pretty much pick what you want and drag it back.  A<br/>\nparty of 2, 3, or 4 should be just fine here.  At 15, I think you can even<br/>\nsolo stuff here.  Just fight off the traffic pattern and watch for the evil<br/>\neyeballs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWest Karana - go for the y-kodis and full kodis - need a helper or 2 and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll do good.  Also if the Dervs are spawning nicely - you and some<br/>\nfriends can keep them at bay.<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Karana - there is a terrible snake problem near the N Ro tunnel.  It&#39;s<br/>\nyour duty to do something about it!  Wear some stuff that is anti-poison!<br/>\nKeep Purifying Rythmns playing.  Asp&#39;s are nasty beasties!  By 14, you<br/>\nshould be able to solo them - having a friend with cure poison really helps.<br/>\nAlso you can hope for the occasional air-elemental and wisp to go by.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhoul - camps - need that magic hitter and some friends but there are 1 each<br/>\nin EC and WC and I heard in Nro or is it Oasis?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 15th level<br/>\na.k.a.
