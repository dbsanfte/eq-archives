There&#39;s a job posting for a Sr Sysadmin there who&#39;s duty is to run<br/>\n&gt; the game servers. 2-4 years Unix required. Some NT preferred. Some<br/>\n&gt; Oracle. From that, my best guess would be world servers on Unix, Oracle<br/>\n&gt; for the login/accounting server. Did DikuMud have it&#39;s own built in<br/>\n&gt; database?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Hot damn, I need a new job where they do nothing, heh.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s all I do everyday, Solaris + Oracle + Web Programming <br/>\n<br/>\n  LPMuds used flatfiles for data storage.  Each user had a file <br/>\n  with their information in it.  I imagine most muds are like this,<br/>\n  since database integration back then wasn&#39;t very common to the<br/>\n  little people.  But I have very little experience in Diku or it&#39;s<br/>\n  spun off variants (Merc/Envy).  It&#39;s pretty easy to get the C libs<br/>\n  for oracle and get the mud to query the database instead of files.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant may use Oracle to accomodate all functionality of the game.  <br/>\n  There&#39;s simply no way to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for them running Solaris on their game servers, one can only<br/>\n  hope &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
