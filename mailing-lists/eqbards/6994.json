The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less from mobs you<br/>\nhave easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon you&#39;ll<br/>\nsometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly trounced by the<br/>\nsame white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the best defense<br/>\nagainst clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in a row with my<br/>\nDirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times anyway.<br/>\nMissing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>\nstraght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight hits are as<br/>\nadvantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of predictability<br/>\nthat kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I don&#39;t get bad luck,<br/>\nwhereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you can handle and<br/>\ncan&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi the speed demon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: CMai [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 2:49 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Dual Wield (Was:Re: [eqbards] pvp bard song suggestions)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>\nonly lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>\nlikely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>\nthing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>\ndeviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>\nyou&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>\nas more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.

The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>\nweapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>\nSilver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>\nand the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.  I<br/>\nhave no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>\nseems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>\nSame mob at same lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nBad Apple, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
