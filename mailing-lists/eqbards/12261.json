However, you have to keep in mind that unless<br/>\nthey&#39;re saving seeds for every event sequence (e.g. whether<br/>\nyour weapon procs, which mob spawns at a site), your<br/>\n&quot;sequence&quot; of random number events is not a really a sequence.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s pieces of the actual sequence, the other random numbers<br/>\nhaving gone to determining if the mob hit your tank, whether<br/>\nyour caster friend&#39;s spell fizzled, whether the guy meditating<br/>\nat the other end of the zone &quot;passed&quot; his skill check, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe order of these events are pretty much random, depending on<br/>\nplayer input, Internet lag, etc.  So even if the random<br/>\nnumbers are only quasi-random, *which* quasi-random number you<br/>\nget *is* random.  So I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame the RNG<br/>\njust because you get a few unusual strings of sequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
