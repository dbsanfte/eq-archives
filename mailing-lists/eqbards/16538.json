Haven&#39;t seen anything make it far after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But don&#39;t you see, that very same argument works against snare<br/>\njust as well as chain.  If all it takes to deal with a runner<br/>\nis a nuke and a DoT, then it doesn&#39;t matter if you overwrite<br/>\nsnare with chain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; While Chains does break early, it&#39;s more the exception than the norm.  On<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mobs with a decent magic resistance, they seem to break early, but those<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What level mobs are you fighting?  In my experience it is a rule, not<br/>\n&gt; exception.  Anything above level 35 or so will tend to break chains at<br/>\n&gt; random times and not last 3 ticks... ever.  My charisma is about 125 and<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it sticks reliably (at L48-49) on the froglok king,<br/>\nbok and guk knights, bats, beetles, LDCs.  I&#39;ve even used it<br/>\non ice giants and seafury cyclopses for the slowdown effect.  <br/>\nThe only things that break out frequently are stuff that&#39;s<br/>\nwhite or higher, and stuff that has magic resist buffs.  One<br/>\nof the low-blue named gnolls in Paw gave me problems until I<br/>\nhit him three times with my pumice stone (if I&#39;d known this<br/>\nwould be a problem, I would&#39;ve had cancel magic memorized).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, you claim you almost never use chain,<br/>\ndeferring to druid/ranger snarers and shaman/enchanter speed<br/>\ndebuffers.  On the other hand, you speak as if with expertise<br/>\nabout how reliable chain is against high level mobs.  Do you<br/>\nsee the credibility problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of us have used Chain every day as our only method of<br/>\nrunner control.  It is not as unreliable as you make it out to<br/>\nbe.  I&#39;d prefer to have a snarer, but if I don&#39;t it&#39;s no big<br/>\ndeal most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when buffed is about 160 something and my dex is usually buffed out over<br/>\n&gt; 200.  Do stats play a role here?  I still have chains wear off after the<br/>\n&gt; first tick if not sooner fighting low blue greater kobolds in B!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve had it wear off immediately from a L2 beetle.  It<br/>\nhappens from time to time.  95% of the time in my experience,<br/>\nit works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m starting to see that a lot of our differences have more to do with what<br/>\n&gt; and where we are fighting then how to use the song.

The same is<br/>\nsomewhat true in Sol A with all the wandering wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hmmm, I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to fight for XP in lower<br/>\n&gt; Guk... But I personally don&#39;t see myself having that chance anytime in the<br/>\n&gt; near future.  Perhaps when the expansion comes out...  (well, one could<br/>\n&gt; wish!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try the live side.  Most people avoid the maze and noble/king<br/>\narea for some reason (probably so set into the camp mentality<br/>\nthat having to run around confusing corridors is terrifying<br/>\nfor them).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
