I played Hymn,<br/>\nWarsong, Psalm of Cooling, and Chain, trying as hard as I<br/>\ncould to keep all 4 effects going (probably succeeded about<br/>\nhalf the time).  When I dropped below half health, I switched<br/>\nto Pixie Strike/Hymn with a lute while I healed up.  I did<br/>\nthis right in front of a little-used zone line for reasons of<br/>\nsafety.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt started off pretty well.  I amazed myself by dropping it<br/>\nabout 20% (one bubble) while only taking one bubble of damage<br/>\nmyself.  Then it got several quick hits in dropping me below<br/>\nhalf, and I switched to heal up while it was down 30%.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext round didn&#39;t go very well.  It got some big hits on me<br/>\nand I was down 3 bubbles before I barely budged its hp - maybe<br/>\n10%, leaving it down about 35% (it healed too while I was<br/>\nhealing).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next two rounds were about average - I chipped off about<br/>\n20% of its hp before it could drop me to below half.  So after<br/>\nfour rounds, the kobold was down 70% or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fifth round had a close call as another kobold spawned in<br/>\nthe room (I was in the hall).  Fortunately, it was just out of<br/>\naggro range and didn&#39;t join.  Another player watched me for a<br/>\nbit, then pulled the new kobold.  I was smelling blood by the<br/>\nend of this round with the kobold down to about 15% of its hp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sixth round I almost killed it, getting it down to just a<br/>\nsliver of hp, maybe 5%, while I was at half.  I decided to<br/>\ncommit to killing it this round, since the zone was just<br/>\nbehind me.  I was starting to regret my decision when it got<br/>\nseveral lucky hits on me leaving me with little more than a<br/>\nbubble, when the other player returned and tossed a couple<br/>\nheals on me.  The kobold started to run once I was healed, and<br/>\nafter 20 minutes fighting the same kobold, I got to loot my<br/>\nkill.  Final score:  me - about 6 bubbles damage, kobold -<br/>\nabout 17 bubbles of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, you can solo, but you probably don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s<br/>\nmuch easier to group or charm (I suppose charm could be<br/>\nconsidered soloing, but killing off the winner solo can be a<br/>\npain too).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
