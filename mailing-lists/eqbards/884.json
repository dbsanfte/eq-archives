Perhaps the bards magical songs are short. Perhaps the<br/>\nmagic is a short spell set to music. Each tick then, is one singing of<br/>\nthe spell. If you sing for multiple ticks, you sing the spell multiple<br/>\ntimes. Twisting then is singing one spell, and then another, and back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough a bard is an entertainer and a storyteller, is it not right to<br/>\nsay that the songs with magical effects are not meant for<br/>\nentertainment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying it would sound pretty to sing one song then another, but<br/>\nthis explanation felt better to me than to think that I am singing two<br/>\nsongs at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nTravelling Trouvere<br/>\nNow Performing at the Guard Post in West Commons<br/>\nCazic-Thule <br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 16 May 1999 15:49:48 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Kristian Leitzen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleit@...\">kleit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: juggling justified<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also a RL musician, and i don&#39;t think that anyone, no matter what<br/>\nyou try to say on here, sings one verse of one song, then one verse of<br/>\nanother song, then the second verse of the first song, then the second<br/>\nverse of the second song, etc.  if you do then you are annoying the<br/>\nhell out of everybody.  this is what i mean when i say that a bard<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do it.  a bard is proud of his singing and wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>\nappear foolish even if it did boost his stats.  this is all IMHO by the<br/>\nway.  everyone is free to their own opinion.<br/>\nOlczyk<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
