I have a level 29 rogue also,<br/>\nand have found that whenever I try to disarm a pet that is currently<br/>\nattacking something else, and it will attack me.  I think the charm thing<br/>\ngoes on the same basis, in that you were on the pet&#39;s hate list because you<br/>\ncharmed something it was attacking, much like I was on it because I was<br/>\ntrying to disarm it while it was fighting (ok, kinda different, but you get<br/>\nthe point...the pets won&#39;t attack PCs unless they are in already in attack<br/>\nmode and have reason - by way of being taunted - to attack something higher<br/>\non its hate list).  Pets&#39; spells won&#39;t affect you, btw, but they can still<br/>\nhit ya hard if you&#39;re in range.  When I got the pets to attack me using<br/>\ndisarm, I could just back off and they would leave me alone (farther away<br/>\nput me lower on hate list) then when the MOB died, it would be non agro to<br/>\nme again (not in auto attack mode).  I&#39;m not sure if theres any quick fix<br/>\nlike this using charm, as I&#39;ve never charmed anything before (my bard is<br/>\nonly level 16 =&#92;  ).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Rokenn Swiftsong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQBards@onelist.com\">EQBards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 10:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Warning on charming and shamen pets<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have had this happend to me twice this week now.  I charm something that<br/>\n&gt; had been attacking a Shamen&#39;s pet (one was a party members pet, other a<br/>\n&gt; non-party member). And both times the shamen pet decided I looked tasty<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; started nipping at me, bad dog! :)  So becareful using charm are shamen&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pets, unless you like being their chew toy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
