That is why that Bards alone cannot get this spell.  It<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be fair for every other class if Bards got &quot;the most powerful<br/>\nability in the game&quot;.  If you would have read my note instead of just trying<br/>\nto flame me, you would have saw that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can pull a hundred reasons out of your ass as to why Bards should have<br/>\nBind and it won&#39;t make one bit of difference.  Bards are not going to get<br/>\nBind.  Instead of beating your head against a brick wall, you should be<br/>\nasking for something that might have a chance of being implemented.  Ask for<br/>\nthe capability to be bound anywhere (or just at Inns) by a caster AND the<br/>\nability to be bound in cities by NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.

In fact it isnt even one of 4 per level group but more<br/>\n&gt; like 1 of 8 or ten.  also our 12th level DD does 7 points of damage max.<br/>\n&gt; Yeah we can cast it a lot if we don&#39;t cast anything else since none of our<br/>\n&gt; spells have the 45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you just a stupid ass fuck?  I am so sick and tired of all these<br/>\ncrybabies who has raised up one character to level 12 and thinks their class<br/>\nis underpowered.  All your facts are so screwed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- &quot;12th level DD does 7 points of damage max&quot;  WRONG.  Every two levels it<br/>\ndoes an extra point of damage.<br/>\n- &quot;45+ minute duration of cleric buffs.&quot;  WRONG.  None of the low-medium<br/>\nCleric spells last that long.  Maybe at 40+....<br/>\n- &quot;The lousy defensive skills of the caster hybrids&quot;  WRONG.  Bard&#39;s Defense<br/>\ncaps at 5/level instead of 4/level for Clerics.  Bards have the same<br/>\ndefensive ability of Rangers and Paladins until level 17-18 (where Rangers<br/>\nand Paladins get Parry).<br/>\n - &quot;lousy offensive spells of the melee hybrids.&quot; WRONG.  Paladins can only<br/>\naffect Undeads.  And if you stop and restart Bellow, you can get many more<br/>\nmagical attacks than a Paladin and Ranger could ever hope to get off.  And<br/>\ncorrect me if I am wrong, I thought that the hybrids stop attacking while<br/>\nthey were casting (or maybe their animation doesn&#39;t show it).  Plus Bards<br/>\nnever run out of mana.<br/>\n- &quot;To call Clerics pure casters is a joke.&quot;  WRONG.
