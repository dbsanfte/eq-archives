What about all<br/>\nthe spots where there is only a single named spawn?  Are these<br/>\nspots simply not worth your time no matter what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MO I&#39;ve seen nearly everywhere is to camp one named mob<br/>\nsite, while pulling generic mobs from other locations.  The<br/>\nonly 2-named-mob sites that come to mind are the<br/>\nassassin/supplier, and the king room in permafrost.

Yes you might<br/>\nlose half your time this time.  But instead of having to wait<br/>\n2 weeks before getting another crack at it, you can go back<br/>\ntomorrow, no waiting (well, aside from the waiting for the<br/>\nnamed mob to show).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis rule does not change the crowding, does not change the<br/>\nmob spawn rate, does not change the item drop rate.  It only<br/>\nchanges the composition and number of the people camping those<br/>\nmobs.  If it results in casual players having easier access to<br/>\noft-camped mobs, then it improves their chances of getting<br/>\nitems from that mob.  If the mob still remains camped to the<br/>\npoint where casual players are discouraged, then it is<br/>\n*already* camped to the point where casual players are<br/>\ndiscouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Result is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>\n&gt; hours at and the long termers get the whole room anyhow for the full time.<br/>\n&gt; Eventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>\n&gt; frustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a room<br/>\n&gt; instead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Define &quot;useful chance&quot; and &quot;not very useful.&quot;  If you normally<br/>\nonly had a shot at a named spawn once every 2 weeks, and under<br/>\nthe new rules if every named spawn has an average of 2 groups<br/>\n(highly unlikely as I don&#39;t think there are that many players<br/>\ndespite the overcrowding); then your shot at getting a night<br/>\nat the named spawn has gone from 1 in 14 days to an effective<br/>\n1 in 2 days.  If you normally had a shot at a named spawn<br/>\npoint once every 2 days, then it&#39;s not camped to the point<br/>\nwhere it&#39;ll be a problem under the old or the new rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand why so many people are so vehemently<br/>\nopposed to the concept of sharing.  When I first started the<br/>\ngame, that&#39;s how I played.  Share the derv camp, share the orc<br/>\ncamp.  I only went along with the camper-has-all-rights rule<br/>\nbecause that seemed to be the majority consensus.  And even<br/>\nthen, if I was group leader and holding a spot with multiple<br/>\nnamed mobs in a crowded zone when another group came looking,<br/>\nI gave them the extra.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think this is one of those prisoner&#39;s dilemma<br/>\nsituations, where the bad choice from an individual<br/>\ncost/benefit analysis results in the best outcome for everyone<br/>\noverall (and the good choice from an individual cost/benefit<br/>\nanalysis results in the worst outcome for everyone overall).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
