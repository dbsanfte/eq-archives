Since the Cape does not provide<br/>\nWisdom, Int or MANA, it is by default Bard Only [since none of the other<br/>\nclasses listed would want it].  But, the GBP Choker gives +7 AGI and +7 Dex,<br/>\nvs. the 2AC, +5 STR, +7 sv magic.  I personally feel that the Cape is a<br/>\nsuperior item.  the 7 AGI might compensate for the 2AC, but the 5 STR and 7 MR<br/>\nis IMHO superior to the 7 DEX.  I have several friends who play tanks, and have<br/>\ncomplained several times that they thought it was unfair that I was wearing a<br/>\nCape, and they couldn&#39;t.  Also, i know for a fact that the Butler can be soloed<br/>\nby a lvl 32 druid (considering that is how i got mine).  According to the druid<br/>\nin question, it was an &quot;easy&quot; solo.
