You should definitely do better than a few<br/>\n  ancient coins. Message Board is a good idea. There&#39;s got to be some nice<br/>\n  armour or weapons they can trade you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Btw, the only coin that I had trouble with was the Kaesora because of the<br/>\n  way the zone is built. Dalnir&#39;s is 2nd hardest but doable alone. Scorp one<br/>\n  is easy if you kill the PHs on the ramp.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tzeetch<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tzeetch - it&#39;s the very simple, and very old, Scrap Metal quest located in<br/>\n  the bowels of Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>\n  Sanfyrd Featherhead (formerly Sanfyrd ontop), will accept scrap metal (in<br/>\n  loads of 4 unstacked at a time), which he will give you coins (a few<br/>\n  silver or copper) and a random item recovered from the scrapyard, which is<br/>\n  usually a rusty weapon, small buckler or Gnomish GlowRod (light source for<br/>\n  off-hand).<br/>\n  I believe that either 1) there is an incredibly small chance for a really<br/>\n  nice item, or 2) it was a fluke. Either way, I just won the lottery as far<br/>\n  as I&#39;m concerned...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
