I&#39;ve been in SK<br/>\n&gt;   looking for rares quite a bit during the weekdays and not seen him.<br/>\n&gt;   It&#39;s also possible that he&#39;s !Lord Grimrot on our server or he has<br/>\n&gt;   been perma killed.  I have to agree with Sylly, I&#39;ve never seen him<br/>\n&gt;   in the last 4 months easily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unique Valentine gifts, available now at eGroups.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
