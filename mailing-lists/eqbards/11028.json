They&#39;re both about the same<br/>\nrarity and require similar levels to get. Personally I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthere&#39;s much difference damage wise between a 6/22 and 6/25 and the proc<br/>\nprobably more than makes up for the difference except in the soluseks<br/>\nwhere everything has a very high resist rate to fire based spells.<br/>\nPersonally I think the axe looks a bit unbalanced as an off hand weapon<br/>\nwhen used with most of the weapons we can use for our primary hand. Also<br/>\nthe axe is probably more replacable later if you decide you want<br/>\nanother, as a lot more people camp that area than the predator.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you killing both the predator and the foreman? They are so close<br/>\ntogether you really should, and then you&#39;d also have a chance at the<br/>\nobsidian scimitar, which isn&#39;t a bad weapon either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
