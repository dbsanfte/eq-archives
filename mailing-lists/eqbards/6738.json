If you<br/>\nlook at the adjectives describing the skill levels, you see the terms awful,<br/>\nbad, poor, good, etc all the way up to master.  Off the top of my head I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure what numerical skill level is required to get a master rating but I<br/>\nthink its around 100 (+/- a few).  Since we are &quot;masters of none&quot;, you would<br/>\nthink that with our secondary skills (non combat/bard skills like hide,<br/>\nforage, sneak, etc) we could at least reach a skill level in some of them<br/>\nthat brings us up to the numerical equivalent of the Very Good/Excellent<br/>\nrating (or whatever the adjective is immediately before Master).<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I think they are taking the &#39;master of none&#39; part of jack of all trades a<br/>\n&gt; little too far, but since there are so few bards our voice is small and we<br/>\n&gt; may never be heard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
