Under the new xp system, a 6th player takes<br/>\na very small percent of xp from the original 5 members.  Assuming the same<br/>\nlevel, here is what happens:<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup5 gets 1000 monster xp<br/>\n1000*1.14/5=228 xp per person (no factoring in multiplier for xp penalty,<br/>\nwhich means nothing in this case)<br/>\n<br/>\nGrou6 gets 1000 monster xp<br/>\n1000*1.2/6=200 xp per person<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means the new player needs to increase your kill rate a mere 14% to<br/>\nbalance out his presence in the group.  Unless you are in an overcrowded<br/>\narea, where you are fighting for kills, that should be no problem.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
