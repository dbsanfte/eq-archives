When<br/>\nI first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>\ntheir corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>\nrun faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>\nonce you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, crying over his loss of speed<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
