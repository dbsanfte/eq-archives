Our group<br/>\n&gt; members do.  For a groupmate of a bard the icon will flash.  <br/>\n&gt; For the bard<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s on solid.  TRUST ME you don&#39;t want flashing icons.  <br/>\n&gt; Icons start to<br/>\n&gt; flash roughly 15 seconds before a spell effect wears off, <br/>\n&gt; this means our<br/>\n&gt; icons would ALWAYS flash since our song duration is shorter than the<br/>\n&gt; flash-warning time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Missing old school friends?
