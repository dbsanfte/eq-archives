I&#39;ve often wondered if, as your experience seems to<br/>\nsuggest, you need higher strength to fully take advantage of a<br/>\nheavier/slower weapon.  That would make it so lower strength<br/>\ncharacters would benefit more from lighter weapons.  OTOH, it<br/>\nwould also make it so higher strength characters would benefit<br/>\nfrom lighter weapons, so if they coded that in there has to be<br/>\na counter to it.
