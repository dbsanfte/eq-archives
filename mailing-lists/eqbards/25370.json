Next would be our first charm song.  Next would be<br/>\nwhere I am now.  39, and I can solo  nearly any blue or black, with<br/>\npatience, using chains and my 2 chants, with drums equipped.  Which is nice<br/>\nwhen you get an add.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn GD, it&#39;s sometimes hard to find a group, so it&#39;s nice to once again have<br/>\nthe option of soloing until I can get one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Our SK&#39;s tank Velketor.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blitz Krieg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 8:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in total agreement.  I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in group play we<br/>\nsimply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that knows how to use<br/>\nus, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers about how we don&#39;t<br/>\nscale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t mirror my<br/>\nexperiences on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not anything more<br/>\ngrand. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ugh....<br/>\n  Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>\nmyself<br/>\n  sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of keeping a low<br/>\n  profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice.  Seriously, don&#39;t laugh, its just<br/>\n  that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>\n  shaman with Can IV....  I used to think all level 60 were equally powerful<br/>\n  but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.
