Unless you&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen using DDD/CoD/Hymn with instruments a lot your brass skill is probably<br/>\npretty pathetic.  Get your brass skill maxed.  Go sit in the tunnel in EC or<br/>\nsomewhere else where it&#39;s safe from wandering mobs, equip your horn and turn<br/>\non this song then walk away for several hours.  When you come back you<br/>\nshould have a much higher brass skill and can sing this sucker reliably<br/>\n(that&#39;s not to say you&#39;ll get it to stick)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found that this is only really a reliable song against blues.  Whites<br/>\nresist it a LOT and so do yellows.  Using a horn seems to bring a bit fewer<br/>\nresits (but it&#39;s entirely possible that&#39;s just perception) and having a high<br/>\ncharisma REALLY helps with this (as with all &quot;mind affecting&quot; songs) song.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 11, 2000 9:53 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] LEHP!!!
