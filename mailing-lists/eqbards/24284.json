Unless its pretty<br/>\nshort, I miss alot of stuff and scroll back later to read it.  I generally<br/>\ndepend on my wife, who is in the same room to tell me when something is ENRAGED.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is no point in stopping to attack when something is berserk at you<br/>\n(your hp are less then 2 bubbles).  You back off or turn off attack and your<br/>\njust a sitting target.  Atleast if your going to die you should maximise the<br/>\ndamage before you do (with crippling blow on, this can be substantial).   So if<br/>\nyou are in a situation where this happens you either get healed or go down<br/>\nfighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast reason, the tanks are twinks and dont know how to play the class properly<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the only time I have walked away from a fight after I turn attack on (to<br/>\nget a drink or some such) is if its totally safe (like there is 4 other tanks<br/>\ntaunting them).  A warrior who goes afk during a non trivial fight is a lazy<br/>\nsod.  The warrior is about the only class that can effectively get vellious mobs<br/>\noff of clerics.  You have to be waiting for that heal, you have to time your<br/>\ndisciplines to make sure the mobs stays aggro&#39;d on you.  You have to have taunt<br/>\nand disarm (even bash where appropriate) ready and be aware of where the cleric<br/>\nand mobs are just in case they do aggro on the cleric.  You have to constantly<br/>\nbe as close to the mob as possible and watch your distance to maximise the<br/>\neffect of taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, the Bard (I love my bard btw :) is a very complex class to play and<br/>\nthat&#39;s why I enjoy the diversion, but dont assume warriors are a no brainier<br/>\nclass :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to your regularly scheduled broadcast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolomani (54 DE Warrior)<br/>\nZhodani (35 Bard and gaining!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. DEX is used for weapon skill increase unless it is lower then INT, then its<br/>\nINT.  Dont know about defense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 5 Mar 2001 14:45:36 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Reeves, Patrick W&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Pixie Strike oddity<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LOL, I think the majority of warriors hit auto-attack and then go get a<br/>\n&gt; beer.
