One time I chased a running mino<br/>\nand accidently got charmed leading to my death.

Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that button - and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Slyde Half-Elf of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wanting to get back in touch with old friends?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reunite through a ONElist community.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Want to learn more about your list users?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Now you can with our new User Survey Tool - see homepage for details </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
