Most changes in the game to other classes usually turn <br/>\n  around and bite us in the tush, due to lack of testing.  And it&#39;s<br/>\n  always a surprise to the coders, and completely unintentional - <br/>\n  which makes me wonder how familiar they are with their own design<br/>\n  and/or whether they have patched it up so bad that it is a mess now.<br/>\n <br/>\n  It obviously, never crossed the minds of the programmers/designers/<br/>\n  testers internally that fixing levitate on casters would eventually<br/>\n  &#39;fix&#39; levitate on bards.  Nor did they realize it with SoW/Selos.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am not pronouncing radical change, I&#39;d just like someone over<br/>\n  there to sit down and think very carefully for a second whether <br/>\n  or not Bards get the skill they are about the change.  This <br/>\n  clearly is not happening during internal testing.  And there&#39;s<br/>\n  no one to blame but Verant for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If only my girlfriend would let me move to San Digeo.  I have<br/>\n  all the background they need for another mud game coder. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
