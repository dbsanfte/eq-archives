I wear Crush&#39;s<br/>\ntunic, very light AC12 and +8 to Magic/Fire/Cold.  I also wear a lizardscale<br/>\nmantle, used to wear a mesh mantle though, smae ac as leather, but far<br/>\nlighter.  I wear barbed sleves now, but they are kinda heavy so I may trade<br/>\nthem in an go back to mesh sleeves.  I wear mesh pants, a leatherfoot raider<br/>\ncap, same ac as leather.  I haven&#39;t had any difficulties staying in fights<br/>\nso far, despite my light armor.  I have found that while I often take big<br/>\nhits, I get hit less often due to more frequent dodges.  It seems to work<br/>\nout fairly close to the same as when I tried going all banded and its far<br/>\nlighter.  In all banded I was close to max weight with no loot and only two<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Arwen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 1:56 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard armour<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Arwen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arwen@...\">arwen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>\n&gt;get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>\n&gt;somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>\n&gt;out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>\n&gt;Melaniel<br/>\n&gt;Wood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and cloack, and<br/>\nblackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>\nhelp alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>\ncharred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>\nisnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>\nlevel for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>\nsupport you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel.
