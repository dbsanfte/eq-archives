I agree that it should be worth 50pp however that has to<br/>\nbe made to happen.  Just pointing out that while there is no way I could<br/>\ntake Dvinn, barring the very unusual circumstances last nite with 9 or the<br/>\n12 people on him dying before me, I can make 50pp.  Therefore to someone who<br/>\ncan&#39;t take on Dvinn, even with a comparable level group (12th), the dirk<br/>\nprobably is worth 50pp or more.  But since its better than many higher level<br/>\nweapons, it still messes up the balance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDid you see Brian Hook&#39;s posting on camping?  I think the dirk is the<br/>\nperfect example of why Brian is wrong.  Dvin always has it so its camped<br/>\neven more because campers know they can run and sell it and come right back<br/>\nfor another one easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso of note, I&#39;ve found that speed is much more important than most people<br/>\nseem to espouse.  While the damage/speed ration is important, I think speed<br/>\nis even more important than that.  I have had little trouble with casters<br/>\nfor quite some time using a fine steel scimitar.  The ranger in my group at<br/>\nthe same level can&#39;t solo caster&#39;s at all because he&#39;s too slow.  Even<br/>\nthough his ratio is better, he doesn&#39;t disrupt their casting anywhere near<br/>\nas often as I can with my faster weapon.  this of course makes the dirk even<br/>\nmore valuable against casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDean Kimes<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n\t12th circle bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
