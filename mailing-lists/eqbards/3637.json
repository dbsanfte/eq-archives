Hola everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently a drunken bard on Rodcet Nife and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; have obtained lvl 42.  Anxiously, awaiting lvl 43<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; damage song even though it is currently semi-bugged, but tis <br/>\n&gt; exciting none the less.  Why may I ask is it exciting?  Well, <br/>\n&gt; for most of my career in barding, I have felt well rounded <br/>\n&gt; with a plethora (Pepe, how many is in a plethora?)of tricks <br/>\n&gt; to boot.  But after the level 32 mana song craze, things have <br/>\n&gt; just trickled off.  I don&#39;t know if it was that they hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; intended the levels to be obtained that high so quickly or <br/>\n&gt; they just decided to let high level bards sift into <br/>\n&gt; mediocrity.  I assume the prior for they are trying to scoot <br/>\n&gt; some new songs in now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take for example, the level 42 song: Berserk Cresendo.  Great <br/>\n&gt; song, 17 str and a extra 5% attack speed from the Celerity <br/>\n&gt; song...  but it won&#39;t stack with anything!  I went back to <br/>\n&gt; the celerity/anthem stack because three stats boosted <br/>\n&gt; (str/agi/dex) and still 20% increase in attack; it far <br/>\n&gt; outways the Berserker song.  So yes, another high level song <br/>\n&gt; that is up to par with another anti-disease song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe, bellows are doing 22 a pop.  Tuyen&#39;s got boosted, but <br/>\n&gt; is resisted so often it is more efficent to just continue <br/>\n&gt; bellowing.  More often though, I just run straight buff songs <br/>\n&gt; with Mystic Shielding cause 22dmg a pop is just enough to <br/>\n&gt; cause a creature to have dandruff.  So, the lvl 43 song needs <br/>\n&gt; to be the one that finally balances us out in the high levels again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, I was at a loss recently to find things to solo while my <br/>\n&gt; crew isn&#39;t on.  Still not soloing much, but I did find a fun <br/>\n&gt; way for two bards (or a bard and a &#39;snare&#39; casting <br/>\n&gt; profession) to beat the crap out of a single critter they <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t do head on.  The first bard plays a stack of <br/>\n&gt; chains/bellows.  Slows the creature down just as fine as <br/>\n&gt; snare spell.  The second bard sneaks up and turns on fear <br/>\n&gt; song.  The creature inches away trying to flee, while you <br/>\n&gt; pummel it to death, all the time keeping it locked down with <br/>\n&gt; chains.  We&#39;ve killed high level 30&#39;s without ever being hit <br/>\n&gt; once.  And it&#39;s not that boring kite stuff either, it&#39;s much <br/>\n&gt; more pleasant to do. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s my ranting and tips for the day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marchandt D&#39;lere<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drunken Bard of Freeport<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guildmaster: Legion of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
