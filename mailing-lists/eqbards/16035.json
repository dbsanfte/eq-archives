THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>\nfall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>\nYou want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your off<br/>\nhand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>\nusing a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>\n(and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24. Even<br/>\nif you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even when<br/>\nyou stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses, and<br/>\nit&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with the<br/>\ntenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
