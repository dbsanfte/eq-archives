The one bad thing about having a<br/>\nMistmoore drum is that you prefer ER to Psalm of Warmth (both<br/>\nhave the same cold resist boost if you use a normal drum with<br/>\nER, but a Mistmoore drum makes ER better since Psalm is sung).<br/>\nIf they provided equal cold resist, it&#39;d be clear that I<br/>\nshould jump in with my weapons, or use a lute with Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to be negligible.
