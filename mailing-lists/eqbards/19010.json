It&#39;s readily apparent that bards are often treated as an<br/>\nafterthought.  Our songs regularly fail even the most trivial testing when<br/>\nintroduced (heal target rather than harm, are DoT&#39;s that only work on self,<br/>\ndo nothing, etc.) and that really annoys people.  It was like a sore that<br/>\nhad been festering for months, and that line in the patch message was just<br/>\nanother poke at the sore by Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone notice that procs were going off far more than usual last nite?<br/>\nI have been wielding two proc&#39;ing weapons a lot since I&#39;ve been in good<br/>\ngroups lately and noticed last night what I thought was an overabundance of<br/>\nprocs.  Since it seemed high I checked with prior results I had gotten and<br/>\nthe number of procs was definitely a lot higher last night.  Somewhere on<br/>\nthe order of going from 3 per fight to 7 per fight with the same mobs.  Did<br/>\nanyone else notice this?  I plan to get numbers tonite.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
