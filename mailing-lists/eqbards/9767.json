Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>\n2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>\n3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>\nfruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water?

(Like, if you have a druid, what is his skill cap<br/>\nand has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
