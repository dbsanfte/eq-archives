Some druid and<br/>\nrangers in the guild have been foraging in Field of Bone recently based on a<br/>\nrumor that the bundt cake could be foraged there.  So far they have come up<br/>\nempty.  Since no one has posted on either eqbards or the Concert Hall that<br/>\nthey have completed this quest, then either the quest is broken and can&#39;t be<br/>\ncompleted or we aren&#39;t looking in the right place.  Based on Verant&#39;s track<br/>\nrecord with quests, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this quest is broken.  If it<br/>\nisn&#39;t broken, then not enough clues have been found for anyone to logically<br/>\nfigure it out for themselves.  For the sake of discussion, lets assume the<br/>\nquest isn&#39;t broken.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a strong feeling that the answer to this quest may be very similar to<br/>\nsome quests that can be found in Dalnir and Kaesora. Last night after my<br/>\nguild&#39;s Kaesora raid I went to Allakhazam&#39;s spoiler site to get some info on<br/>\nDalnir(for finding the ancient coin).  Found out that there are a couple of<br/>\nquests you can do within the dungeon.  Certain mobs drop No Drop quest<br/>\ncomponents.  Some mobs also drop scroll pieces which give you clues about<br/>\nthe quest.  Find all the quest components and combine them in the forge<br/>\nlocated somewhere in Dalnir and you get a magic item as the reward.  The<br/>\nfallen crypt raider in Kaesora also drops an illegible scroll as well as a<br/>\njournal (which I couldn&#39;t read).  Several times during the raid mobs dropped<br/>\na No Drop pestle which no one had any idea what they were used for.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other No Drop items in Kaesora that can<br/>\nbe combined somewhere in the dungeon to create a magic item similar to the<br/>\none in Dalnir.  Its quite possible the bundt cake quest is similar to the<br/>\nquests in Dalnir in that the solution is found somewhere within a dungeon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another strong feeling that the reason that no one has solved the<br/>\nburynai bundt cake quest is that they aren&#39;t looking in the right place.<br/>\nLets assume that the answer lies somewhere in Droga (there is an oven in<br/>\nthere).  I&#39;ve never been there but I think its safe to assume that the<br/>\ndungeon is under utilized(just like Kaesora and Nurga).  Since E&#39;ci is an<br/>\nolder server, the majority of the players are 40+ level.  They are hanging<br/>\nout in areas where they can get EXP points, not dungeons where everything is<br/>\ngreen to them.  So my guess is that until someone spends a lot of time in<br/>\nDroga (assuming that is where you must complete the quest), its gonna be<br/>\nawhile before this quest gets completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are some questions that need to get answered:<br/>\n1)  Has anyone found a recipe scroll/book for the bundt cake?<br/>\n2)  Has anyone foraged an item which logically may be part of the quest?  If<br/>\nso what is the item&#39;s name and what zone was in foraged in?<br/>\n3)  Has anyone looted anything from a burynai that may be a quest component?<br/>\nI&#39;ve looted normal burynai mobs in Frontier Mtns but so far all they have<br/>\ndropped is money.  There are named burynai in Frontier Mtns which may drop a<br/>\ncomponent for this quest but I&#39;ve never looted one before.  <br/>\n4)  Has anyone gotten the quest NPCs to give out any additional clues other<br/>\nthan the standard quest text?<br/>\n5)  Do you have to have Baking skill to complete the quest?<br/>\n6)  Any other questions someone else can think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
