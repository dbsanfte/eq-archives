Then at 53 they get another dot<br/>\nwhich looks like a swarm upgrade but actually stacks with their last<br/>\nswarm spell. This allows them to stack up 3 dots at once for 4k dmg over<br/>\n1 minute.  Druids don&#39;t get an upgrade to the 49 AoE until 58, Fist of<br/>\nKarana, and by that time raptors would be all green. The only other post<br/>\n50 AoE they get is a rain spell, and rain spells don&#39;t follow the<br/>\ntarget, they rain on the target area so they are useless for quad<br/>\nkiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqdruids.com/expansio1.htm\">http://www.eqdruids.com/expansio1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI see other druids out there too, but they&#39;re all rotting, not kiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
