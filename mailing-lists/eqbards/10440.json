(My boss<br/>\n&gt; is a wizard)  I thought to myself wouldn&#39;t that be great, to be able to<br/>\n&gt; research new songs.  Well, then I thought to myself, that isnt really<br/>\n&gt; practical because no one would &quot;research&quot; a song.  But then I thought<br/>\n&gt; wouldnt it be even better if we bards could do our own form of research in<br/>\n&gt; songwriting.  Of course we couldnt just write a song a then be done.  What<br/>\n&gt; if we could do musical research and put components together to make new<br/>\n&gt; songs.  After all, wouldn&#39;t real bards write their own songs?
