I spent a lot of the last <br/>\nweekend running around looking for lambent components on my own (because I think I&#39;m <br/>\nhigh enough level to do so), but my guild interactions included:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I got into two Lower Guk groups with five others in the same Guild (different <br/>\npeople each time).<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Cleric comes from FP to Sol A (when he was headed to Guk) to help me retrieve my <br/>\ncorpse from the lava at the bottom of the stairs (I needed goblin protection).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Wizard offers me a Lambent Stone, in return I help her kill a named Shadowknight <br/>\nand a Skeleton Monk in Upper Guk for her Acumen Mask quest (now that little excursion <br/>\nbrought back some of the fear I&#39;ve missed lately, let me tell you...)<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Same Wizard later offers me another Lambent Stone, in return I help her get a <br/>\ndrop off of the Shadowmen in Lavastorm.  We both die on the first attempt (they&#39;re <br/>\ntoo closely packed for Lament to work right).<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Level 45 Ranger comes six zones out of his way to pull Shadowmen for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Level 50 Warrior asks if I can help him heal in Sol A, so I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  I help his level 26 Enchanter get 2/3 bubble in 30 minutes by Chain/Pixie <br/>\nStriking goblins (ungrouped) and singing Mana Song (group) so she and her pet can <br/>\nkill them in relative safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  He takes me to Sol B and gets me some nice exp fighting no-exp-for-him kobolds.  <br/>\n(Would have been better if i know where the blankety-blank zone point was.  I died <br/>\nright next to it after running in circles for two minutes...)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
