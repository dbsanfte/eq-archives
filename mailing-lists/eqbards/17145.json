Odds are if I was even 80% as effective as them I would win out by<br/>\n&gt;random chance vs some mobs when I did well and they did not and I would get<br/>\n&gt;the mob attention.  This never happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really.  The mobs are programmed to react to combat in a pre-defined<br/>\nmanner.  If you&#39;re not doing anything to taunt the mob (ie, debuffing,<br/>\nhealing its opponents, etc), it&#39;s going to be based purely on the amount of<br/>\ndamage you are doing and your proximity.  Hence, if Player A is doing just<br/>\n5% more damage than Player B, with proximity being equal, and nothing<br/>\nfactored in except damage, the mob is going to focus on Player A.  I believe<br/>\nthat&#39;s John&#39;s point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All combat messages were on and they way outdamaged me, not even close.<br/>\n&gt;Ranger has double attack in addition to dual wield and the sk was just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>scary<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;with double attack and his 2-hddr.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, they are going to outdamage you.  That is a given.  The issue is, by<br/>\nhow much?  And, unless you parse the data, you&#39;ll never know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Neither the ranger nor the sk worried about putting points anywhere but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>strength and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;agility and stamina because it just didn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These stats don&#39;t contribute as much as originally thought.  Also, of the<br/>\nstats listed, only Str makes a noticable difference to combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  the sk can hit twice in a round for 40+ points each hit (Dark Reaver),<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the ranger<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;has the same combo I do, PGT and Dirk, plus he has double attack so can hit<br/>\n&gt;twice as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but what does he average?  And, how long does he wait between swings?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Consider.  All melee classes get 6 or 7 melee skills except bards.  we get<br/>\n&gt;two, dodge (which everyone gets) and dual wield.  That&#39;s not even close to<br/>\n&gt;50%.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only 4 of those skills are offensive skills -- Dual Wield, Double Attack,<br/>\nKick, and Bash.  You can either Kick OR Bash, not both, and the damage from<br/>\nthis skill is supplementary; it doesn&#39;t constitute a large amount of the<br/>\ndamage.  So, basically it boils down to Dual Wield and Double Attack; which<br/>\nputs us in the 50% category.  Including Kick/Bash may drop that to 44%, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s still close to 50%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other skills are defensive skills, and don&#39;t apply to damage output.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, until someone takes the time to quantify melee damage done<br/>\nthrough parsed logs with similar weapons, I&#39;ll never subscribe to the &quot;bards<br/>\ndo nominal melee damage&quot; line.  I&#39;ll accept the fact that we do the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
