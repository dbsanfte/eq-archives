Kitasi and I were both agreeing that GM events should<br/>\n&gt;be geared towards a specific level range.  For example, if there is a GM<br/>\n&gt;event in GFay, which is a low level zone, then the only people eligible to<br/>\n&gt;participate and receive any potential reward are those people in the level<br/>\n&gt;range the zone was designed for.  But Verant doesn&#39;t do this.  If they hold<br/>\n&gt;an event in GFay the entire zone will be full of level 50s trying to kill<br/>\n&gt;the GM controlled mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are you speaking of all gm driven events or just the test of events?<br/>\n<br/>\nthe test of events seem geared towards higher level players, no doubt about<br/>\nthat.  is there anything inherently wrong with that?  not really.  i may like basketball,<br/>\nbut i don&#39;t expect to be able to play in the NBA.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a perfect world GM events would be focused on roleplaying and not killing<br/>\n&gt;the GM controlled mobs.
