Treasure your lower levels while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit waiting for a group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever waited was 4 hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ carreer, but have a lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give up exp in a heartbeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Daryl Schwemley <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 12, 2000 4:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night I fired up my &#39;puter to persue my favorite pasttime, Everquest<br/>\n  (bet ya didn&#39;t see that coming!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m camped out in the windmill of the lake of ill omen, so I shout once for<br/>\n  a group, and then proceed to wander of to the skelly ruins.  There&#39;s a group<br/>\n  of 2 rangers and shaman there whacking on things and the shaman spots me.<br/>\n  He runs over and asks if I&#39;m grouped.  Since I&#39;m not yet, I join them in<br/>\n  their destruction of the undead in the area.  Things proceed nicely.<br/>\n  Everyone is happy to have a bard and are thoroughly impressed with the<br/>\n  increase in effectiveness of the group, but then one of the rangers decides<br/>\n  to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We figure we&#39;ll still be ok and I pull out my claw and silvery axe instead<br/>\n  of my dual gnoll hide lariats which I was using before.  Things continue to<br/>\n  be good until the shaman decides to pull a skelly and two come.  Of course,<br/>\n  this valley has lots of wanderers, so we pick up two wanderers also.  The<br/>\n  ranger peels off one mob while I start tanking (ack!) one of the skellys<br/>\n  (and one of the wanderers of course) and the shaman blasts the other skelly<br/>\n  to oblivion.  Things are looking bad as I get down to a little less than two<br/>\n  bubs, so I flip on Selo&#39;s and start running circles around the group while<br/>\n  they finish off another mob.  The shaman and ranger med and heal while I<br/>\n  keep the last two mobs busy running in circles.  Then we manage to polish<br/>\n  everything off.  This was really nice.  Both the shaman and ranger were duly<br/>\n  impressed, but then the ranger and shaman both had to camp out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Things have been going great this night, so I decide to look for another<br/>\n  group, and find a rogue to partner up with.  We move over to the back<br/>\n  entrace of the Sarnak fortress, and I use lament to pull one of the two<br/>\n  sarnaks at the entrance.  We proceed to demolish this recruit (I love<br/>\n  rogues!).  And continue to pull a couple more singles.  Things are still<br/>\n  going great, we&#39;re finishing up another recruit when another player runs out<br/>\n  of the fortress and starts yelling for help.  We proceed to finish our fight<br/>\n  and just as this recruit dies, bam, we get trained by a sarnak adherent and<br/>\n  pet.  I get nailed by a darkness spell and end up dying.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I proceed to remem my songs, grab a spare drum and truck it back to my<br/>\n  corpse.  The rogue asks the other player why he trained us and his response<br/>\n  was that since we didn&#39;t help us, he figured we should go down with him.  I<br/>\n  was floored.  We were already engaged, and he thought we should turn to help<br/>\n  him???  I guess I should have logged off sooner. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gilgurth<br/>\n  Bard of 25 Winces<br/>\n  E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
