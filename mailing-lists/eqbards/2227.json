Definitely not a minotaur axe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (delay 37)?  At low dual wield skill level, it will activate<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so infrequently that the damage it does is negligible, so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t be afraid to buy a 21 delay dagger off a merchant for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2pp (though if you find someone selling a fine steel dagger,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; all the better since it is 19 delay).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Once you get it maxxed out, you want something with a good<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage/delay ratio, and perferably with a low delay.  You&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;&gt; also find that dual wield will often drain your stamina faster<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than you lose hp.  Lighter weapons will reduce this effect,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; which is more reason to prefer low delay weapons since they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tend to be lighter.  (I *think* weapon type affects this too,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; as I&#39;ve noticed more stamina drop swinging a 5 lb staff than a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5 lb sword.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You&#39;re 17 and still using minotaur axes?  Beg/borrow/buy some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magic weapons - many of the mobs you should be fighting are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; invulnerable to normal weapons, especially undead.  For<br/>\n&gt;&gt; combine weapons (can be bought at various gypsy camps), my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; preference is the rapier, spear, longsword, then scimitar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (scimitar is the cheapest).  If you have some friends around<br/>\n&gt;&gt; L20, drop by Crushbone and kill Dvinn for his dirk - it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; perhaps the best weapon you can get in this level range.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make sure *all* my friends have a magic weapon by L15, even if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it means I have to loan one to them.  It is just not worth it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; having half your heavy hitters standing on the sidelines<br/>\n&gt;&gt; playing cheerleader if you get an ice bone skeleton, or fire<br/>\n&gt;&gt; elemental, or any of the other multitude of mobs that require<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magic weapons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;&gt; John H.
