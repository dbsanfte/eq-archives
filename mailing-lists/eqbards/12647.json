LoD will barge in and take over<br/>\n  anything from anybody, even if plans are made.  This was <br/>\n  after a lot of people posted the fall of Cazic, where LoD<br/>\n  failed to drop him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --clip--<br/>\n<br/>\n  You got Cazic. Congrats. Couple of you guys are actually using the<br/>\nsuccess of many many brave adventurers to try and put down LoD. Tell you<br/>\nwhat, not gonna happen. Wanna know why ? We do things with ONE guild and<br/>\nonly a couple of SKILLED players. Not throwing numbers at each and<br/>\neverything. So like, thinking you can match us or even top us is quite<br/>\nsilly. It&#39;s two diffrent things ya know. I have yet to see ONE guild<br/>\naccomplish anything bigger than taking down the ghoul lord without the<br/>\nhelp of 765743654 other guilds and unguilded ppl. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, you made server wide efforts to break fear and finally got it done<br/>\na while ago. Quite an accomplishment. Then, again a server wide effort got<br/>\nyou the victory over Cazic. Nice jobs. But nothing to brag about and think<br/>\n&quot;hey, now we own LoD cuz they didnt kill him&quot; because you can&#39;t compare a<br/>\nserver wide effort with just one guild killing gods and dragons. The one<br/>\nthing is nothing but brute force, the other is skill. No guild on Innoruuk<br/>\nother than LoD is even remotely close to beeing able to kill a god or<br/>\ndragon. Pantheon may at some point be able to pull it off, but they still<br/>\nhave a long way to go. But at least they are organized and smart. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have to admit that I was impressed you could get Cazic with numbers<br/>\nactually. I won&#39;t be impressed again until I see ONE guild accomplish<br/>\nsomething without the help of 7657653473 other ppl. <br/>\n<br/>\n  --clip--<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is the bullshit people have to put up with on Innoruuk.<br/>\n  I doubt anyone will be able to do either dragons, while this<br/>\n  guild exists.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  +=================================+<br/>\n  | Ryan Honeyman, Programmer      /<br/>\n  | Decipher, Web Group           /<br/>\n  | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.decipher.com\">http://www.decipher.com</a>      /<br/>\n  +-----------------------------+<br/>\n  | phone&gt; 757.664.1126        /<br/>\n  | pager&gt; 757.629.1567       /<br/>\n  +==========================+</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
