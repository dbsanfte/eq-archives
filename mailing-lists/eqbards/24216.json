I don&#39;t have this song and I<br/>\nwould love to get it.  I often use a buff song here, usually AC buff like March<br/>\nof the Wee.<br/>\n6 - agree<br/>\n7 - So often we have a snarer and slower, so I put Fufil&#39;s Curtailing chant<br/>\nhere for extra damage.  I don&#39;t use one of the higher damage ones because I<br/>\nlike to debuff magic more.  BTW in Velious the three chant tactic is often<br/>\nunuseable because so many mobs are very cold resistant.  It&#39;s frustrating at<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n8 - Sometimes BBB (almost always with FCC to make sure it will stick),<br/>\nsometimes an AOE (fun in DN - when we trip a spider trap we go to AOE hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for screech - I don&#39;t use it inside anymore because it is resisted so much. <br/>\nAlso in the new lands you can outrun something&#39;s aggro radius much more easily.<br/>\n So sometimes SoT is a good getaway song - stop whatever it is in its tracks<br/>\nand make a break for it.  But I do try to keep chains (binding) and fear up<br/>\nwhen we are exploring or traveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh incidently, I did use screech in DN the other night, and I outran aggro and<br/>\nfired invis - and then Jaled Dar DTed me.  So I wondered if somehow I aggroed<br/>\nby using it (I wasn&#39;t using an illusion).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and while I am rambling, I got Lullaby out to try and taunt so I could get<br/>\nsome defense improves - and it didn&#39;t work! *cry*  I am going to try it on the<br/>\nnext beetle trap pop I think heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a final thought - Wee and Rondo are fun &#39;You feel small&#39;  &#39;You are no<br/>\nlonger aroused&#39; heh<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) Selo&#39;s (changes to Invis or Lull indoors)<br/>\n&gt; 2) Cantana (never changes)<br/>\n&gt; 3) Song of Dawn (changes to Resist song #2 or chant if needed)<br/>\n&gt; 4) McVaxius Rousing Rondo (never changes)<br/>\n&gt; 5) Occlusion of Sound (changes to Resist song #1 or chant if needed)<br/>\n&gt; 6) Song of Twilight (never changes)<br/>\n&gt; 7) Largo&#39;s Absonant Binding (never changes, been using 23 chains forever<br/>\n&gt; because when i first got 51 binding i thought i remember it being a lower<br/>\n&gt; slowdown)<br/>\n&gt; 8) Screech (never changes, see below)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; any of the songs that are not &quot;never changes&quot; of course i can swap out for<br/>\n&gt; any rarely used or situational song i may need, e.g. charimsatic carillion.<br/>\n&gt; as far as #8 Appaling Screech, i really need to rethink this.  i am never in<br/>\n&gt; an area anymore where this song will not be resisted by everything i sing it<br/>\n&gt; on.  it used to be such a handy song, but with the fear cap i need something<br/>\n&gt; else here, any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
