I finally re-read the manual seems i had <br/>\nskipped the part about learning spells thinking &quot;i am not a <br/>\nspellcaster&quot; whoops!  I learned Battle cry just now as per some stuff <br/>\ni read at another site, and i bought the locating lyric for level 4.  <br/>\nI will check that F10 thing hopefully finally get the game in full <br/>\nscreen...

Save the<br/>\n&gt; loot off your kills and sell it to a vendor.  Run some<br/>\n&gt; of the quests and save.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The level 3 song - Jig of Vigor - can be every<br/>\n&gt; helpful.  It restores stamina - which you lose when<br/>\n&gt; you fight and when you jump alot.  Jumping while you<br/>\n&gt; run is an old trick for running a bit faster.  Jig<br/>\n&gt; helps you do that when you need to escape from a bad<br/>\n&gt; situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are 3 &quot;views&quot; you can selected with the F10 key.<br/>\n&gt;  One has a smaller view screen and lots of option and<br/>\n&gt; control boxes.  Another is all grapgical and no text<br/>\n&gt; or controls. The third one is called &quot;fullscreen&quot;  or<br/>\n&gt; full screen overlay.  It fills your screen and has<br/>\n&gt; transparent boxes for essential items (text, spell<br/>\n&gt; gems, health, group, self and buff icons.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It sound to me like you have the &quot;screens same<br/>\n&gt; resolution&quot; checked.  Use F10 to find the view with<br/>\n&gt; all the controls showing.  Use the &quot;options&quot; button to<br/>\n&gt; get settings for general, display, keyboard, mouse and<br/>\n&gt; chat.  In display - look for &quot;screens same resolution&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and change that setting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck and enjoy!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Virtuoso, somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; Mercenary Force<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- compugeeke &lt;compugeeke@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi, nice to see this group here!

He is now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn songs?  How <br/>\n&gt; &gt; do i do that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, is the game supposed to run in full screen? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have it on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher resolutions the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; game screen gets smaller.
