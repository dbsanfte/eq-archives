I&#39;ve even been deleting some of them unread.  I know some<br/>\npeople find it faster to type that way, but the time you save typing,<br/>\nI spend trying to decipher what you meant.  And, to me at least, its a<br/>\nsign of someone who doesn&#39;t care how they&#39;re presenting themselves to<br/>\nthe rest of the list.  In email (and Usenet, as this also holds there)<br/>\nwe can only judge you by the style of writing you use.  And whether<br/>\nyou hold any intelligence or not, that style tends to make people<br/>\nlook less than intelligent.  In any case, I&#39;m not telling you to<br/>\n*stop* using d00dtype, but I delete it if I can&#39;t decipher it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not bashing Sylly here; from previous posts, I do think he has a<br/>\nclue.  I just want to make sure that other people can *see* his clue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
