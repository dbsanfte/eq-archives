Maybe it&#39;s just my <br/>\ncharacter that&#39;s glitched, but I found that forage and hide are buggy.  I <br/>\nhave never been able to train either of them past their starting values. <br/>\n As a bard I&#39;m supposed to be able to train forage at 12th level and hide <br/>\nat 25th level, but they both said I&#39;d reached my maximum limit when I <br/>\nreached those levels and attempted to train.  (I don&#39;t know the numerical <br/>\nvalue, but it&#39;s very bad.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
