I lost &quot;only&quot; a bit more than a half bubble<br/>\ninto 46.  My friends who&#39;ve died at 46 all said they lost<br/>\nabout 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 bubble per death in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it really looks like you lose a lot more experience in the<br/>\nlevels after hell levels.  I&#39;d love to flame the genius at<br/>\nVerant who thought that one up.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
