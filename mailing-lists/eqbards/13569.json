My first buff was Illusion: DE yet he stripped<br/>\n  my Agility and Strength in the first attack (which both were in the<br/>\n  middle of my buff list).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our L22 song is the same way.  It took me 4 pulses to remove resist<br/>\n  fire from myself, and Reso/SoW took 2 or 3.  Things that stripped<br/>\n  first:  Shaman buffs.  Things that went last:  Resist buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the wave against Nagafen, I had 170 FR.  And again, I lost<br/>\n  a full bubble of health, confirmed this time with 2100+ hps. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  DragonBreath does one bubble of damage if you are in melee range<br/>\n  as a minimum (with 2000 hps).  The key here is in melee range, as<br/>\n  our cleric was hit with AE far back, and took much much less dmg.<br/>\n  Magic resist in the 200s, and I still got feared once briefly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The new AE Fear also bugs casters as once they are hit, there is<br/>\n  a chance they will not be able to cast spells.  (You have not <br/>\n  recovered... permanently)  With our casters in this state, it<br/>\n  was pure melee that brought the dragon to the &#39;Lord&#39; in Lord <br/>\n  Nagafen.  But it was without healing and nuking, umm hehe there&#39;s only<br/>\n  so much the melee peeps can do.  Too bad the programmers at Verant<br/>\n  cannot get their stuff straight.  It&#39;s a shame the players have<br/>\n  to pay for their constant mistakes.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
