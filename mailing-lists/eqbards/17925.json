I&#39;d order armor in bulk.  Bunches<br/>\nof tunics, pants, helmets and capes (hardest pieces to get stuff of) of<br/>\nMedium size.  I&#39;d get this stuff in Freeport for about 1pp/AC.  Then I would<br/>\nrun to  Qeynos and sell them for 1.5pp/AC.  I would give &#39;credit&#39; on sales<br/>\nto regular customers as well.  I raked in about 100pp profit per trip and<br/>\ncould do 2 trips a day and sell about 20-30 peices.  The market dries up<br/>\nafter about 2 months as everyone is twinking newbies at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s still not a bad concept ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Heskett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tarkin@...\">tarkin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 17, 2000 5:50 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Speaking of lower levels...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the worst orders are the ones where you ask 20 times &quot;are you SURE you<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; a gorget? a spiked collar would probably be a lot better and cost as much&quot;<br/>\n&gt; they reply &quot;sure sure, full suit&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; then an hour later running back and forth from misty thicket to HH because<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re making small and you run to EC and finally show up after a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; impatient tells and he says &quot;Oh!  i just need a tunic, legs and cloak now.<br/>\n&gt; how much for those 3?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hehe ulcers coming back to me from this.  i charge 1000pp to make a full<br/>\n&gt; suit of banded now.  very effectively tells people i&#39;ve hung up my<br/>\n&gt; sledgehammer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; but there is something to be said for being able to create actual armor<br/>\n&gt; (that isn&#39;t half bad) from your own hands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 17, 2000 2:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Speaking of lower levels...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a Master Smith on the Karana server it is just not worth my time or<br/>\n&gt; effort to make and sell Banded anymore.
