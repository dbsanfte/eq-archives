I hope this doesn&#39;t go away quietly in a few days.  I think what<br/>\nVI did was cowardly, despicable, and probably illegal if ever held to the<br/>\nlegal fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was more serious that Vault network is shutting down.  I was<br/>\ncurious to hear a theory that Sony might buy out the Vault Network&#39;s parent<br/>\ncompany to shut them down since they basically provide free advertising for<br/>\nall of EQ&#39;s competitors.
