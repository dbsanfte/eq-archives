Of all the classes that get a speed increasing<br/>\nsong, We Bards are the only ones who should get an indoor zone speed song.<br/>\nWe sing from memory, devoid of a &quot;GOD&#39;s&quot; speed blessing.

The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>\nbeen removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>\nI almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>\npeople felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>\nthat this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>\npoint regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>\nsong in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>\nI&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>\ncomments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that I<br/>\nsend in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 43 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>\ngame.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>\nthey are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>\nat least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>\nget them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>\nquesting for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>\neffect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>\ndoes not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>\nit protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>\nthis song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>\nlooks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>\npatch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>\nregularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>\nexpect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>\nequipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>\nwrists.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>\nimplementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>\nspell uses, along with its casting time.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book<br/>\nshow what instrument skill is required when you right click on a song?<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>\naren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>\nwere raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>\n1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
