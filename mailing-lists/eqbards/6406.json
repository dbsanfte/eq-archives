Could he have<br/>\nbeen a little more inaccurate?  My personal guess is that (if he played one at<br/>\nall) he played it up to maybe level 7.  Some of my friends and i have exchanged<br/>\ne-mail with JC before, and he has consistently been misinformed, wrong, etc on<br/>\nmany issues, and refused to accept any evidence to the contrary.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\neven know what Lullaby does!  That&#39;s just amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, i had posted on friday asking if anyone knew where the Runed Lava<br/>\nPendant was dropped.....i found out....after obligatory spoiler space.<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\n:<br/>\nThe Runed Lava Pendant is (a very good item for bards) AC5, +6STR, +5 Fire<br/>\nResist.
