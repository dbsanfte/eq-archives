When I died at 30th level, the EXP<br/>\n&gt; bar didn&#39;t drop very much.  I still lost the same amount of EXP I did when I<br/>\n&gt; died at 29-, it just wasn&#39;t as noticeable because it takes so much extra EXP<br/>\n&gt; to get thru those levels.  When you died at 47 and dropped to 46, your EXP<br/>\n&gt; bar decreased a full bubble into 46.  Had you died at 46 with only a few<br/>\n&gt; pixels to go before making 47th, you would only have lost maybe a 1/4<br/>\n&gt; bub(normal EXP loss).  So in effect, when you died at 47 and dropped a full<br/>\n&gt; bub into 46, you got penalized more than you should have.

All my<br/>\nfriends who died at 46 said they lost over a bubble. That<br/>\nindicates the exp loss at 47 is less than the exp loss at 46.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I died at 31, I lost a half bubble into 30.  When I died<br/>\nat 30, I lost a quarter bubble.  That indicates the exp loss<br/>\nat 31 is more than the exp loss at 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of these indicate the exp loss at (hell level+1) is<br/>\ngreater than at other levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
