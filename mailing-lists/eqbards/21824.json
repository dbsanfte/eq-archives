When you show them pictures of the old and new one -<br/>\nthey say they&#39;ll look into it.  After six months of no response - they come<br/>\nback and tell you that the original roller coaster was way too scary - that<br/>\nthe other customers who didn&#39;t like roller coasters - but preferred the<br/>\ntwist-o-whirl - were complaining that the roller coaster was too exciting in<br/>\ncomparison - and had to be toned down - so there twist-o-whirl was the most<br/>\nexciting ride in the park...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 3:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:44 PM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;To be honest I think the ranting would stop the first time we ever got a<br/>\n&gt;real answer other than &quot;we&#39;ll look into it at some point&quot; and &quot;working as<br/>\n&gt;intended&quot;.
