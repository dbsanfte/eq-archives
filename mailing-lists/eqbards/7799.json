No more waiting for the boat:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would someone go about doing this to themselves?  I would guess that the<br/>\nonly way we could kill ourselves without causing EXP loss would be with DDD,<br/>\nCofD, or bellow.  I have never tried targetting myself with these so have no<br/>\nidea if they damage you or not.  I thought I read somewhere that if you die<br/>\nfrom a DOT cast my a player while dueling you will still take an EXP loss.<br/>\nThis could apply here also so you would only want to use it to get yourself<br/>\nvery low and then bellow from there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if this method does work, it only goes to show you that players will<br/>\nalways figure out a way to do something that the game designer never<br/>\ncontemplated.  While it would definately be an exploit, I would term it an<br/>\ningenious exploit and not a stupid one:-).<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tFrank Hartmann [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FRANHART@...\">FRANHART@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, October 04, 1999 11:40 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: RE: [eqbards] Bard vs Wizard race?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Frank Hartmann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FRANHART@...\">FRANHART@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, attacking youself never causes a guard to go off on you. Of course, by<br/>\n&gt; attacking yourself I mean casting harmful spells on yourself. You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; actually melee with yourself. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure about the idea that killing yourself doesn&#39;t cause experience<br/>\n&gt; loss. Maybe not blowing yourself up, I&#39;m not sure.
