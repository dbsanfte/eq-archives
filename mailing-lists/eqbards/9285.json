At 28th I have no intention of fighting in there, as<br/>\nwe&#39;ve all heard the horror stories from the folks that are 40+.  Having<br/>\nworked a monk up to level 23 prior to joining the One True Path of bardness,<br/>\nI thought I had a pretty good feel for Upper Guk (UG) having hunted there<br/>\nfor mesh.  Boy was I wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nUG is freakin&#39; huge - much bigger than my poor misinformed monk had ever<br/>\nthought it was.  It also holds a wealth of mobs that gave great experience<br/>\nfor me at level 28 and my other party members up to 32.  My 32nd Necro<br/>\nfriend was impressed with the amount of experience he was getting.  The real<br/>\nkicker is that none of this stuff was camped.  We walked right into a great<br/>\nlittle camping spot and proceeded to make great exp and decent cash<br/>\n(occasional 2pp drops) and never encountered another soul.  Died only once<br/>\nwhen a train of 20 or so frogs sprinted into our room for no apparent<br/>\nreason - we had had NO runners, no AE songs/spells, nothing.  In fact we<br/>\nhadn&#39;t even been fighting for several minutes.  We all decided that they<br/>\nmust have been agro on someone else and come to us, or a bug or something.<br/>\nIt was weird.  Even still, thanks to bard power I was the only casualty.<br/>\nWhen they sprinted in I immediately fired off a Screech and 20 of them<br/>\nturned and fled.  The monk feigned, the Necros gated and the frogs came back<br/>\nand killed me.  Mission accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nLG was surprisingly fun too.  I zoned in and /ooc&#39;d &quot;How often to Shin<br/>\nGreaves and Shin Gauntlets drop and can a humble 28th level bardess please<br/>\nloot them for a quest?&quot;  The response was the they dropped &quot;Too damned<br/>\noften&quot; and that I should have one of each in around an hour.  So I sat in LG<br/>\nhugging the zone like a little schoolgirl, waiting patiently and /ooc<br/>\nreminding people I was looking every 10 minutes or so.  I saw a 35th Druid<br/>\nhurt and sitting near the zone so I grouped with him to heal him up.<br/>\nSurprisingly we stayed grouped and started killing undead froggies near the<br/>\nzone - and it turned out to not be that hard.  They were yellow to me at<br/>\n28th, and green to just about everyone else in the zone, so he and I had<br/>\nthem all to ourselves.  I gained a bubble of experience and killed for and<br/>\nlooted my own Shin Guantlets and Greaves!  Even better!  I didn&#39;t even come<br/>\nclose to dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the moral is &quot;Don&#39;t forget Upper Guk&quot; and for those in their mid or<br/>\nhigh 20s, &quot;Go into Lower Guk with a friend or two and kill the lower level<br/>\nstuff near the zone for your own Shin Guantlets and Greaves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 28th song bard on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
