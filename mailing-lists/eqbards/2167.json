You might try pulling to the zone border<br/>\ntill 24th, and then you should be able to latch onto a group in the<br/>\nthrone room which can be less laggy though YMMV. In my experience a bard can<br/>\nbe a great addition to a group of people that are higher level. Currently at<br/>\n26th I group with people alot of whom are 30th-32nd in the throne room.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you should not be dying so much. Either your healers stink, your<br/>\ntanks dont taunt, or you aren&#39;t firing up selo&#39;s soon enough. I have<br/>\nsurvived many times to the zone in cazic with my drum on and about<br/>\nhalf a bar of health. If in doubt, zone and live to fight again<br/>\nin 2-3 minutes =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in cazic for the last 6 levels and will probably get 27th there<br/>\ntomorrow. Not to mention I got my first piece of rubicite there today<br/>\nwhich is nice, even though it took FOREVER. (up the spawn rate on the<br/>\ntae&#39;s please!).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing about cazic - if you arent healing while resting and<br/>\nnoone has pets, USE SONOROUS CLOUDING! I can&#39;t tell you how many times<br/>\nsomeone has yelled TRAIN, I invised the party, and we watched the<br/>\nshow in peace. I&#39;ve actually finally maxed my wind skill because of<br/>\ninvis-ing in cazic. Sometimes if it looks hairy I will invis the<br/>\nparty even when I would rather heal it - you start to get the<br/>\nfeel of a train coming before anyone shouts it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBerk, RZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Douglas Bierbower [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bierbower@...\">Bierbower@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 20, 1999 12:12 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQbards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Douglas Bierbower &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bierbower@...\">Bierbower@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YUCK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spent the day in Cazic Thule.  I loved it and hated it.  Experience<br/>\n&gt; galore, but I died five times and gave most of it back.  Loot is okay,<br/>\n&gt; but the market for fine steel is drowned and merchants only give me<br/>\n&gt; about 6pp and 6gp for Two Handed Swords.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The data rate tends to hover between 1200 and 3000 in the Courtyard, and<br/>\n&gt; the maze even got camped out later in the day so that the data rate was<br/>\n&gt; still greater than 1000 in there.  That just made tough situations<br/>\n&gt; worse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there any good open areas for a 23 bard to go to?  I am sort of<br/>\n&gt; burnt out on indoor areas and confined spaces.
