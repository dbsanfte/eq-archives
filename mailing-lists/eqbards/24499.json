First, none of the normal sites seem to<br/>\n&gt; have information on what drops a Lute of the Howler. Can <br/>\n&gt; anyone fill me in<br/>\n&gt; please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second, on crowd control, how do you fellow bards handle groups of 4+<br/>\n&gt; mobs? I can easily handle mobs #2 and #3 with charm, but if no one is<br/>\n&gt; smart enough to root #4 the group is in trouble. Mezz isn&#39;t reliable,<br/>\n&gt; especially while trying to control a pet, and there&#39;s usually no room<br/>\n&gt; indoors to kite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Tzeetch<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
