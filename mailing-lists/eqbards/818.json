I was<br/>\nsoloing there for half of 12th level while trying to get enough belts<br/>\nto get my squad ring in Rivervale (which I just got this morning<br/>\nfinally).  I found that switching between the 1-orc and 2-orc camp<br/>\nworked great, and I could hold my own even if I failed to lull one of<br/>\nthe orcs in the 2-orc camp and both came after me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTigsen<br/>\n12th level half-dark-elf bard on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--- CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a<br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; place for me to solo.

I went to Nro and<br/>\n&gt; all the<br/>\n&gt; places has been camp out.
