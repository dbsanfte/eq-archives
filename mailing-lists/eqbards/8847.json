After you zone into Sol A, pass the lava and go<br/>\n&gt; through the hole in the wall, you&#39;ll come to a T intersection<br/>\n&gt; at the ledge.  If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; doorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>\n&gt; wall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>\n&gt; window above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>\n&gt; following the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>\n&gt; with the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.  So<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s actually not that bad a place to use as a base and pull<br/>\n&gt; to.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
