I have NEVER been feared with a MR in this<br/>\n&gt; range.  Since we can achieve this 150 with only Elemental playing, there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not a real need for me to twist in a second song anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Level is the single most factor in resisting any spell.  I cannot stress<br/>\n  that enough.  Magic resistance will then add to that factor.  This holds<br/>\n  true for anything.  I&#39;ve had my MR over 125 at the kobold noble spot and<br/>\n  have still been charmed around L40.  At L50, I resist it everytime even <br/>\n  lower MR of 80 or so.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I will investigate cold resist and fire resist against dragons more<br/>\n  in the future.  But I&#39;ll tell you this.  With no buffs, and a CR of<br/>\n  only 39, Vox&#39;s breathe weapon when she appeared in the King Room <br/>\n  only did 200 dmg to me.  So that completely debunks the CR theory,<br/>\n  and as I stated that you will resist it normally on your own via the<br/>\n  random number generator.  I will look into it more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I will also report that we had 54 f&#39;ing people at this Vox raid...<br/>\n  wanna know how I stayed alive when all hell broke loose?  I knew<br/>\n  this raid would fail as soon as I crashed 3 times in a row, and when<br/>\n  5 or 6 people went LD after each battle so I took Harmonic up on the<br/>\n  ledge that looks over the king room, stopped all songs, and just<br/>\n  waited up there until all the ice giants were killed.  I told my group<br/>\n  to move up with me as well, because it does take 54 people to kill<br/>\n  a handful of terrors, spiders, and giants.  As soon as the shit hit<br/>\n  the fan, /sit /camp /quit.  And I lived.  I honestly saw it coming,<br/>\n  and was on the buttons subconsciously.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So the point here is, if you have 200 or so L50 people on your server,<br/>\n  there&#39;s no reason to risk the lives of many by taking L40 people.<br/>\n  Plus you&#39;ve got limited people to work with, obviously 12 people cannot<br/>\n  do Vox, but neither can 54... jesus, I&#39;m having shivers from the lag <br/>\n  last night.  24-30 people is probably optimal for doing _any_ mob in<br/>\n  the whole game.  So with limited people, you need to take the right<br/>\n  ones.  Again, if your server is strapped for people at the time of<br/>\n  the raid, then you have to make do.  Otherwise, planning the right<br/>\n  mix and level of people is key.  We had the right level of people<br/>\n  last night, no one was invited unless they were L49 or L50.  Even<br/>\n  had 4 bards show up.  There was just too many people there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n========================================================================<br/>\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to: <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\nand reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n========================================================================</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
