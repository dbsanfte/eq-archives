Also, bard songs have some special &quot;Side Effects&quot; <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;times.<br/>\n&gt;Some of these can be useful, some can be lethal. For example:<br/>\n&gt;Root - While playing the Accelerando, root and similar spells that generate<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;BOOT&quot; icon will<br/>\n&gt;             have no effect on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I seem to remember that WHILE playing Accelerando it was possible for me to <br/>\nbe rooted, BUT i could cancel the effect by stopping and restarting the <br/>\nsong. I don&#39;t recall it ever making you immune to root. Correct if I&#39;m <br/>\nwrong! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I found (to my dismay):  I was really excited when I got my <br/>\nScreaming Mace. I know a bard using blunt weapons may sound strange, but if <br/>\nyou look at the stats the Screamer is like a magical mino axe - same dmg, <br/>\nsame speed, hits magical, and BONUS random Strength from it&#39;s Scream/Yaulp <br/>\n(I really liked this because you could stack it on top of EVERY other Str <br/>\nbuff - I had like STR 175 or something with a shaman buffing me, my strength <br/>\nsongs, some magic items, and the Scream).<br/>\nWell - it all sounds good, but I found that the Screamer causes your songs <br/>\nto go out of wack. When the Scream is in effect you can&#39;t sing. You start a <br/>\nsong and it immediately ends with no effect. So I had to get rid of my mace <br/>\n(sigh).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll post if I find that any other items cause this effect. Also would <br/>\nappreciate if any other bards have experienced anything like this with other <br/>\nmagical items - it would be nice to post. It was rather irritating to find <br/>\nthis out after getting all the required components for the mace (what a damn <br/>\nannoying quest).<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
