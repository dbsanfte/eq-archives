I have my taunt maxed, and usually max it at new<br/>\nlevels within one or two fights.  I can taunt any green or blue off of<br/>\nsomeone in 2 taunts, any white off in 4 taunts (unless they are below 2<br/>\nbubbles health), but yellows and reds can be *extremely* hard to taunt off,<br/>\nin that our skill isn&#39;t high compared to whatever it is that makes mobs<br/>\n&quot;resist&quot; the taunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t rely on a warrior to take all the damage if you are dumb and get 5<br/>\nmobs on you.  BTW, I taunt the entire time during a fight, and I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nwizards stand next to the mob and peel if off of me in one cast, then I have<br/>\nto turn my attention elsewhere and waste time trying to peel while getting<br/>\nhit from behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaluvil, 14th bard<br/>\nTeaggin Downfeather, 21 warrior<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 03, 1999 3:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Superstitions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Well, These are inane, it is NOT the bards job to extricate him<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or herself, for one simple reason YOU CAN&#39;T. A same level warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cannot taunt anything off me, not ever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then it&#39;s time to find a new warrior, because the one you are<br/>\n&gt; grouping with sucks.  Tell them to learn how to click the Taunt<br/>\n&gt; button more.  A warrior can taunt _anything_.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;singing a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you have lulled them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nothing frenzies a monster quicker than a pixie strike, charm<br/>\n&gt; mix.  The monster stays on me for 3 or 4 round, and then the<br/>\n&gt; warrior has taunted enough to pull it off me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;They will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am in the near perfect group as I have said before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They will kill you if you think you are gonna tank damage.<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;ve got no hp.  At level 31, I have 700 or<br/>\n&gt; so hp.  I&#39;m fighting monsters that do 50 - 80 damage a pop,<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes double attack.  It is YOUR job to pull out as<br/>\n&gt; soon as possible from a confrontation, and let the tank TAUNT<br/>\n&gt; it off you always.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whether you use your weapons or not, 90% of the damage in<br/>\n&gt; most typical battles comes from the casters and tanks.<br/>\n&gt; You are supporting the battle with your buffs, debuffs,<br/>\n&gt; crowd control, healing.  I&#39;m not saying to stop swinging,<br/>\n&gt; cause that doesnt matter at all, I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; continue to piss off a frenzied monster any more than it<br/>\n&gt; is.  The tanks are more suited at absorbing damage than<br/>\n&gt; you are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 31st ding.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; ...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
