I couldn&#39;t at <br/>\n&gt; 49.  Chardok is<br/>\n&gt; very underused and getting a pickup group there is normally <br/>\n&gt; unlikely at best<br/>\n&gt; at any level.  Karnor is difficult - but in the right group - <br/>\n&gt; you might be<br/>\n&gt; okay.   I did the Dog tower at about that level.  They had a <br/>\n&gt; really good<br/>\n&gt; group with cleric and enchanter - and basically told me to <br/>\n&gt; stand back and be<br/>\n&gt; careful what I sang to not agro the mobs enough to become a target.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAgain - I think your odds of getting a pickup group are <br/>\n&gt; low - and it<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; be risky.

First of all I<br/>\n&gt; love my bard!

Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>\n&gt; singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>\n&gt; instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>\n&gt; using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>\n&gt; to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>\n&gt; do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>\n&gt; and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; __________<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; __________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2001 11:03:03 -1000<br/>\n&gt;    From: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Question on &quot;Drafting&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well first off you didn&#39;t say what level your own character <br/>\n&gt; was.  He has to<br/>\n&gt; be high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53. <br/>\n&gt;  Off the top<br/>\n&gt; of my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to <br/>\n&gt; get EXP when<br/>\n&gt; grouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at <br/>\n&gt; least in your<br/>\n&gt; 40s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Assuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would <br/>\n&gt; be X/X+53.<br/>\n&gt; This is the base EXP amount you receive.

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; if you mean<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments <br/>\n&gt; have partials.<br/>\n&gt; Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how <br/>\n&gt; the sound itself<br/>\n&gt; is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips <br/>\n&gt; vibration creates<br/>\n&gt; the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child <br/>\n&gt; - a big day<br/>\n&gt; for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>\n&gt; Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>\n&gt; instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the <br/>\n&gt; exception of the<br/>\n&gt; flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations <br/>\n&gt; caused by the<br/>\n&gt; wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tA saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a <br/>\n&gt; brass player - we<br/>\n&gt; are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies <br/>\n&gt; the sound.<br/>\n&gt; This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search <br/>\n&gt; of a good<br/>\n&gt; reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get <br/>\n&gt; one or two in a<br/>\n&gt; box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

From what I <br/>\n&gt; have read, a lot<br/>\n&gt; of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in PoG <br/>\n&gt; in order to<br/>\n&gt; lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for us <br/>\n&gt; to remain<br/>\n&gt; non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun since <br/>\n&gt; we could both<br/>\n&gt; scout and pull.<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to <br/>\n&gt; cast mem blur on<br/>\n&gt; the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option <br/>\n&gt; would be for the<br/>\n&gt; bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. <br/>\n&gt; This would work<br/>\n&gt; assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the <br/>\n&gt; mob. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; know if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>\n&gt; In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up <br/>\n&gt; playing mana<br/>\n&gt; battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but <br/>\n&gt; getting to be main<br/>\n&gt; scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; __________<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; __________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2001 15:33:47 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Daniel P.
