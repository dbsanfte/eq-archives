I&#39;m not the most eloquent bard here on the list nor<br/>\nam I the most active, but I have always felt at home here.  It has been a<br/>\npleasure to read of the adventures of other bards both young and old.  I&#39;ve<br/>\neven had the chance to meet and talk to some of you in game which has always<br/>\nbeen awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe days grow long.  The nights even longer.  I can no longer justify the<br/>\ntime expenditure.  I can no longer sleep in late due to the previous night&#39;s<br/>\nquesting while ignoring my wife and children.  It is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo each of you, I say farewell.  Enjoy your time in Norrath.  I hope you<br/>\neach obtain that which your hearts desire.  For me, it is enough.  To obtain<br/>\nthe mystical power of bard charm has completed my desire.  There is nothing<br/>\nleft that holds a candle to my real life at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nCharming Fool of 29 Winces [retired]<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
