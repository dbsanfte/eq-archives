If you&#39;ve got an annoying green runner,<br/>\n&gt; snare (and the old Chain) will not stop it until it&#39;s at about<br/>\n&gt; 25% health.  The only option used to be rooting it.  Now you<br/>\n&gt; can Chain it.  It also makes Chain/Screech a much easier combo<br/>\n&gt; to use since your opponent will be immobile half the fight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
