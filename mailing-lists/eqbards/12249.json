WHen I read that post, I knew it was<br/>\nflawed...  (I was waiting for someone else to say something, figured<br/>\nmaybe I was just imagining it).<br/>\nAs both my main char (cleric, 112 wis, skills all maxed) and bard (104<br/>\ndex, 118 cha, skills maxed in the songs I use), whenever I level it is<br/>\nfizzle city...  I miss notes and fizz spells I have been casting<br/>\n(singing) for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat example happened last THurs (I play my cleric on THurs only, so<br/>\nactually my bard may soon pass him).  Clerics uses the same heal spell<br/>\nfrom lvl 4 to lvl 14 (light healing).  I was at lvl 12 (alteration<br/>\nobviously maxed), fizzles were so rare I never even factoered them into<br/>\na fight (I assume this means 5%).  DING, Welcome to lvl 13.  5 fizzles<br/>\nin two fights (6 succeful heals, so it was 5 fizz in 11 tries).  I would<br/>\npass it off as random chance, except for it seems to happen every single<br/>\nlevel.  I had similar results trying to run from a dervish at lvl 11<br/>\nwith my bard, I missed notes 5 out of 7 tries (I lost the song once I<br/>\ngot it going from stun).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>\nmay be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>\n(both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>\nnumber generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>\nwrite code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>\nof the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>\noriginal IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>\neliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>\nand y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>\nplots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
