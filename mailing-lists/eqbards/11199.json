There were several bards there all in great need. People were screaming they needed a bard in their group (mainly for the mr and cold resist factors than mana) me being the lowest person there (i think) at 40th level and my first time on a huge adventure like this I was chain smoking :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know at least one of the bards that were there is on this list besides my self that being Maev.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther bards oncluded Theog, Ryana Fendryl(spelling) and some other blueberries I didnt get the names. We had I think right at 40 people with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cleared the ice giant priests magi etc. We got to her lair and I must say that she has one hell of an area ice spell :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY bad part about it and Maev I know will have words on this was the loot randoming at the end. BIG FIGHTING on who should be in the random of each item. Other than that I was honored to be a part of it, speciallly at level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did take several sceen shots if anyone wants them only 2 of vox her self as I didnt really have the time to hit ANOTHER button. But they are neat none the less<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know what she dropped I will list to the best of my knowledge(since I didnt win anyof it :)) if You dont want to know ill leave some spoiler space....<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar 40th Bard (hail lady vox/you feel your skin freeze/ loading please wait/ Welcome to west freeport hehe wasnt THAT fast of a death but sure seemed like it)<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nspoiler space<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nspoil space<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my knowledge these are the items and stats that Lady Vox had on her:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpear 13dmge 35 delay<br/>\nBelt 10 str 10dex 10 agil and haste effect they said was broken<br/>\na 2handed hammer that proced the rune 3 spell<br/>\na 10 slot bag that reduced weight 100%<br/>\n2 dragon teeth that either were for 49th necro pet research OR had one charge of the necro 49th pet spell ( i could never get a straight answer)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly correct if not EXTREMELY near to the stats of the loot on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats to everyone who took part in her demise...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks maev for you good points durring the horrible loot arguements at the end.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
