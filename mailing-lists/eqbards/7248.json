By level 23, I knew 23 <br/>\ndifferent languages (I am not certain, but I don&#39;t think we get Thieves <br/>\nCant in the guild, I think we have to learn it elsewhere).  I have <br/>\nheard that there are 24 languages in the game, but haven&#39;t confirmed <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe languages are at the bottom of the skill list; new ones appear as you <br/>\nlevel up.  You need to invest one point in a language to have it show up <br/>\non your skill list. Be warned, knowing that many languages makes it <br/>\nreally annoying to select from the language box.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome instructions on language training (I am not sure if this is <br/>\nBard-specific enough for this board, but, hey, what do they give us that <br/>\nmany languages for if not to learn them?):<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  It is not particularly useful to learn a language to less than <br/>\nExcellent (100 skills), since you will just have to find another teacher <br/>\nlater anyway.  If you are learning, you should insist on Excellent (100 <br/>\nskills), if you are training, you should guarantee it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Training is best as a group activity, otherwise you will spam the <br/>\nworld and cause bad lag, which ticks off the locals.  The trainer and <br/>\nhis/her trainees should form a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  For a number of reasons (I won&#39;t bore you), train near a zone point, <br/>\nin a quiet corner.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Trainers should set up a social with a /g statement on EVERY line.  <br/>\nEach line gives a separate learning attempt, so maximize your button <br/>\npressing.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  The social should be attached to a button.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Instruct your trainees to:  sit down, turn off group speak (so they <br/>\ndon&#39;t lose training notifications in all the spam), and tell them to <br/>\nstand up when they believe they have stopped learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Play a song.  Otherwise, it is hard to count the skill increase <br/>\nmessages (since they don&#39;t give you a numeric value, for some annoying <br/>\nreason).   <br/>\n<br/>\n8.  Start spamming (hitting your social button as fast as possible).<br/>\n<br/>\n9.  When all trainees are standing, you can stop spamming.  Instruct them <br/>\nto zone and check their skill rating (the changes do not show up until <br/>\nafter zoning).  If anyone is not maxed, tell them to come back, and top <br/>\nthem off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a quite useful for occupying your time on a boat.  The boat trip <br/>\nis just about the right length (a little short, but finish on the pier).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor lower level bards in need of cash, training in the rare languages <br/>\n(languages other than the normal racial languages) can usually be sold <br/>\nfor about 5pp, more for Thieves Cant.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kenross Cantoforjado, 25th song, Innoruuk<br/>\nExcellent in Elvish, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elder Elvish, Old Erudian, <br/>\nDragon, Elder Dragon, Thieves Cant, Giant/Combine (and, of course, <br/>\nCommon)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBenjamin Jerrad Segal wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 27 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone noticed that the obscure bard guildmasters seem to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teach all the languages out there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As your level increases, more languages appear to be trained.  I check<br/>\n&gt; back every few levels to see if any additional ones appeared.  A few came<br/>\n&gt; in at 5, then a few more around 10, more still somewhere between 10 and<br/>\n&gt; 20, and at 20 most of the &quot;standard&quot; race languages were available for<br/>\n&gt; training (gnomish, elvish, etc).  I&#39;d love to train them someday, but no<br/>\n&gt; doubt it would take a while by someone who does know it (don&#39;t know if<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s possible to raise skill simply by speaking in it).  After about 20<br/>\n&gt; minutes of nonstop spamming from a 6-line /g social, my Elvish is &quot;very<br/>\n&gt; good.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note that you must zone before language improvements take effect, at least<br/>\n&gt; from learning by ear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And you wondered what to do with all your practice points. -.-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Athren Notechaser, progress in progress<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
