Hate singing, but I can fake it.  Bards were just as<br/>\nmuch actors anyway, eh?  Actually the keepers of history.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what sort of bothers me about the more, shall we say, rustic races:<br/>\nthey have no bards.  This, to me, makes little sense, with no scholars you<br/>\nthink the trolls and ogres would at least have a bardic equivalent, perhaps<br/>\nonly using drums.  Tribal cultures always have bards!  In fact, once the<br/>\nscholars start writing histories the bard loses its importance, and becomes<br/>\njust an entertainer.  In a tribal culture a bard is much more important.<br/>\nLike a troll can have a shaman, I do think a troll should have some sort of<br/>\nbard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop was first created with Wizardry Proving Grounds.  No bards in that<br/>\ngame, but he changed classes a lot, became quite a jack of all trades!  Took<br/>\nhim to D&D, then I remember fondly A Bard&#39;s Tale, ah yes.  Having to run up<br/>\nto town to get Roop drunk so he could continue his songs, a great game for<br/>\nits time.  I sort of rollplay Roop the same way here, only he keeps a<br/>\nplentiful supply of mead rather than water in his backpack, heheh.  And my<br/>\ncharacter description isn&#39;t a lengthy bio, but just a description: &quot;This elf<br/>\nhas bloodshot eyes and smells faintly of fishwine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
