I twist two songs pretty easily by<br/>\nhaving the ones I want to twist on hot buttons, next to each other.

Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried doing it with the keyboard and like the mouse better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also remapped all my favorite keyboard commands, including the ones<br/>\nfor the hot buttons, onto the keypad.
