You have a great understanding of your<br/>\nsongs and how they relate to various other classes.  So, when you have a<br/>\ngood group and it seems like all the bases are covered, think about the<br/>\nadditional ways you can enhance your party.  Many of our songs have more<br/>\nthan one effect and while some other party member may have a better spell,<br/>\nthe secondary effects can add.<br/>\n<br/>\nChant of battle: +dex +str +ac<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, you say we all &#39;know&#39; dex does not matter that much.  But we also &#39;know&#39;<br/>\nthat AC is king and str will boost max damage potential.  So, when the<br/>\nenchanter buffs the tanks with attack speed - by all means Chant to buff AC<br/>\nand Str.  Look for other songs that either buff party AC or debuff mob AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nLargos:  Non-Party: AE -AC, -30% ATK Speed -does not break enchanter mez -<br/>\nlooks like it is custom made for work with enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nScreetch: AE fear - if you are chaining and its sticking and you are<br/>\noutdoors or able to affect a single mob, try fear after chain.  Not only is<br/>\nthis the tactic that enables bards to solo, it works well in group fights<br/>\ntoo.  In crowded fights, it probably is not an option but maybe you are in<br/>\nSouth Karana and you can make that snared avo turn away and take a beating<br/>\ninstead of dishing one out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBellow: every bit of additional damage helps. Does your<br/>\nsword/dagger/staff/whip consistently hit for 14?<br/>\n<br/>\nChords: same cautions as Screetch but if you have the chance to use it -<br/>\ngive it a try.  Its a &#39;vintage&#39; song and single effect so it should &#39;stick&#39;<br/>\nwell even to mobs with higher cons - and it&#39;s DoT.<br/>\n<br/>\nJig of Vigor:  this song regens castsers morale &lt;g&gt; sorry could not resist.<br/>\nActually, you are now probably getting to fight mobs where the fites are<br/>\nlasting longer and longer.  As you and your party members stamina bar drops,<br/>\nyour attack speed decreases.  If you have an opportunity to play a song<br/>\nbecause other members have covered other bases, this is a good one.  Keep<br/>\neveryone&#39;s sta bars maxed and you will keep their attack speeds maxxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLament: you can use this to control the pulls and thus the fites you get<br/>\ninto.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts from looking at the song chart.  There are no &quot;set&quot; ways<br/>\nof doing things.  Try different things and see what works best for you and<br/>\nyour groups.  Have some fun now and good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 45 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 10, 2000 5:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Level 27 Strategy.
