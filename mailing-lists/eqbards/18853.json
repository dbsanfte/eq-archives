The scaler level bonus is (level-25)/3 (Note:<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about post 50 but this holds true up to<br/>\n50) for 1h weapons and is primary hand only (there is<br/>\na slightly different 2h damage scalar for 2h weapons).<br/>\n I.e. at level 50 every time you hit with your main<br/>\nweapon you do an additional 8 points of damage.  The<br/>\neasy way to test that this is primary hand only is to<br/>\nDW two different types of weapons and log the results.<br/>\n Look for your minimum hits not your maximum as that&#39;s<br/>\na more easily identifiable number.  Your minimum hit<br/>\nwith primary hand will be 1+bonus and your min with<br/>\nsecondary hand will be 1.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of bunuses:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strength and dex bonus are not applied to your<br/>\noffhand.
