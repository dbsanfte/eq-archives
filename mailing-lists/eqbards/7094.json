I&#39;ve had many a times<br/>\nwhere I was zoning and could hear myself being attacked but<br/>\nwas still waiting for my screen to show me what was going on<br/>\nand allow me to fight back. With guards and any character of<br/>\nlow level, a couple hits and you&#39;re dead before you even get<br/>\nto see what happened, or type anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d still like to see how you expect to get past the Grobb<br/>\nguards that sit outside the entrance in the first place. Let&#39;s<br/>\nsay you in fact are level 19 or higher and you have your invis<br/>\nsong. You get past the guards, get bound just inside the tunnel<br/>\nand all is well. Now you&#39;re dead. You have no invis. You can&#39;t<br/>\ngo to the bank. Luckily no guards have been dragged to the zone<br/>\nborder. You have to figure out how to get past the <br/>\nguards outside. How do you propose this is done?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
