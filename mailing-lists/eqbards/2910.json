Then Veeshan would be screwed already as Aradune already wields this<br/>\nsword.  It is one hand slashing, or at least it was in beta, and supposedly is a<br/>\npaladin holy sword although aradune is a ranger so its interesting to see how he<br/>\nruns about with it.  It does look like a 2 handed sword, but so does the<br/>\nGhoulsbane, another onehanded holy sword.<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver<br/>\nThe Lost Order of Akalabeth<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCodo the Mysterious wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Codo the Mysterious&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually on the topic of &#39;unique&#39;, I have recently heard a rumor about the<br/>\n&gt; Flaming Avenger. (REALLY Big, supposedly Paladin only sword.) The rumor I<br/>\n&gt; caught was that Verant had only put one and only one of these on each<br/>\n&gt; server. Now, I have never seen this weapon, and don&#39;t know anyone who has<br/>\n&gt; seen it, so I still don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s 1H Slash or 2H Slash (IMHO, it<br/>\n&gt; should be 2H). But anyway, just thought I&#39;d pass that little tidbit on....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lulen<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 12th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Wayne Sheppard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, July 04, 1999 11:31<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Two of the same weapon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For roleplaying sake there should only be one of each unique monster and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon.  Once you kill Dvinn or Crush, they should be dead and you get<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipment.  They would not come back to life to spawn more equipment for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bu this is a MMPORPG.  You cannot restrict the monster or item to just one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person.  Therefore he spawns again, giving someone else a chance to kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Lore Item is a way to restrict people from continuous camping.  The<br/>\n&gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that others would then have a chance to kill the monster and get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Date: Sat, 3 Jul 1999 14:10:12 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Sean Kennedy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s the big deal with people wanting 2 of the same item?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking for a new hobby?
