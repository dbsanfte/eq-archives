And if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t use my method I hope that it at least gives you an idea that will work<br/>\nfor you.  If other folks have a method that they feel is better, please let<br/>\nme know!<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving weapons to and from general inventory quickly requires that you have<br/>\nboth your [melee 1] and [melee 2] slots also in your hotkey bank alongside<br/>\nyour general inventory slots.  You can quickly switch from one hotkey bank<br/>\nto another through the use of SHIFT-1 through SHIFT-6, so I have 6 songs in<br/>\nhotkey bank #1, 6 songs in hotkey bank #2, and inventory and melee slots in<br/>\nhotkey bank #3.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving two banks of songs allows me to have my primary &quot;melee&quot; type songs in<br/>\nbank #1, with perhaps my Magic Resist or other specific-use songs in bank 2.<br/>\nBecause Verant kept assigning funtions to alphabetical keyboard keys without<br/>\ngiving us a way to change them, I finally gave up and resigned myself to<br/>\nusing the numbers 1-6 for twisting my songs.  Therefore, in battle if I&#39;m<br/>\ntwisting three songs I&#39;m pressing &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, and &#39;3&#39; typically.  &#39;5&#39; for me<br/>\nis Selo&#39;s, and usually &#39;6&#39; is some song that isn&#39;t often used like Screech<br/>\nor Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices, Choices.  There are a lot of useful songs to chose from, so it&#39;s<br/>\nvery hard to decide sometimes:<br/>\n<br/>\nSong #1: Celerity (Anthem at lower levels)<br/>\nSong #2: Chant of Battle (maybe DDD here)<br/>\nSong #3: Binding or Chains<br/>\nSong #4: Pixie Strike, Hymn or Chains<br/>\nSong #5: Selo&#39;s (other if in dungeon)<br/>\nSong #6: Screech or Lullaby<br/>\nSong #7: Guardian Rhythms (or Clarity)<br/>\nSong #8: Elemental Rhythems (or Hymn)<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkey bank 1:<br/>\n[song 1][song 2]<br/>\n[song 3][song 4]<br/>\n[song 5][song 6]<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkey bank 2:<br/>\n[song 1][song 7]<br/>\n[song 8][song 4]<br/>\n[song 5][song 6]<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkey bank 3:<br/>\n[melee 2][melee 1]<br/>\n[inv.  1][inv.  2]<br/>\n[inv.  3][inv.  4]<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkey bank 4:<br/>\n[assist][train]<br/>\n[sit   ][     ]<br/>\n[      ][     ]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe songs that I have memmed almost always at level 37 are Celerity, Selo&#39;s,<br/>\nHymn, Clarity, Chains (with Pixie Strike almost always).  That leaves two<br/>\nsongs that change situationally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo twisting three songs using bank 1 might yield Celerity (or Anthem), Chant<br/>\n(or DDD), Binding.  If a casting mob joins the party, I hit SHIFT-2 and<br/>\ncontinue twising using the same three buttons on the keyboard, but now I<br/>\nmight get Celerity (or Anthem), Guardian, Elemental.  Since keys &#39;1&#39;, &#39;4&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;5&#39; and &#39;6&#39; stay the same between banks I put Selo&#39;s, Chains, Pixie Strike<br/>\nand other frequently used songs there.  That means that whether or not<br/>\ncasters are in the mobs that we&#39;re fighting Pixie Strike is, say, button<br/>\n&#39;4&#39;.  So if we pull to many I hit &#39;4&#39; to use Pixie Strike to mez one,<br/>\nwhereas if we&#39;re fighting casters and I switch to bank 2, I still hit &#39;4&#39; to<br/>\ninterrupt them with Pixie Strike.  This consistency between banks helps<br/>\nreduce those instances where you&#39;re trying to remember which button had<br/>\nPixie Strike on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to change from weapons to instruments I hit SHIFT-3, click on the<br/>\nweapon in [melee 1], drop it on the instrument in [inv. 2], then click in<br/>\n[melee 2], and then [inv. 1] to stow down my offhand weapon after equiping<br/>\nthe weapon.  My method would not work at all if you wanted to try and juggle<br/>\ninstruments/song/weapons during combat.  I personally don&#39;t feel that the<br/>\neffort and risk of dropping valuable weapons/instruments is worth the<br/>\npayback.<br/>\n<br/>\nHotkey bank 6 is the bank that I use when charm-fighting giants, etc. so<br/>\nit&#39;s a bit odd:<br/>\n<br/>\n[Song 1][Song 2    ]<br/>\n[Attack][Guard here]<br/>\n[Song 3][Song 4    ]<br/>\n<br/>\nSong 1 is Song of Sirens, Song 2 is Selo&#39;s, Attack is &quot;/pet attack&quot;, Guard<br/>\nhere is &quot;/pet guard here&quot;, Song 3 is Chains, Song 4 is Screech.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
