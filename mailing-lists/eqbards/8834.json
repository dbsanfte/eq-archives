The mesmerize/stun effect is what is broken.  Also,<br/>\nthe frequency at which the mesmerize/stun doesn&#39;t work seems<br/>\nto depend on level.  It works almost all the time against<br/>\ngreens and low blues, but against high blues or higher, it is<br/>\npretty much useless - charm works better, which is why I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen using Siren&#39;s recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is definately stunning long enough to disrupt caster<br/>\n&gt; mobs though, an essential use if you&#39;re camping Solusek<br/>\n&gt; Mages for their booties.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The stun and knockback both interrupt casters.  We&#39;re mostly<br/>\nmissing the stun component right now, so the song is less<br/>\neffective at interrupting than before.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
