I haven&#39;t experienced this, unless my group was engaged with the<br/>\nmob.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have noticed that even when healthy, another PC can &#39;scrape off&#39; an angry<br/>\nmob on you from a fight that has gone bad.  Wonder why they made the AI<br/>\ndisregard a person that is killing them to attack a stranger?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is normal mob behavior, independent of bards.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nheavily wounded, mobs will see you as an &quot;easy kill&quot; and stop<br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing to finish you off.  I&#39;ve seen a Cazic<br/>\nfanatic we were fighting run all the way across the courtyard<br/>\nto finish off someone who was almost dead, then run back to<br/>\ncontinue fighting uss.  When we were pulling ice giants, some<br/>\nbozo who refused to leave the king area was beaten down to<br/>\nunder two bubbles by an elite goblin guard, and the giant<br/>\nstopped attacking us to finish him off.  I&#39;ve also seen a<br/>\nL35ish player in West Commons kill a griffin and live with a<br/>\nsliver of health remaining.  A passing bear and orc pawn<br/>\nattacked him, even though stuff that level never normally<br/>\naggros on a L35 player.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
