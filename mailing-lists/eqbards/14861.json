Like some here, I am a long-time lurker, occasional<br/>\nposter. I started my bard last August and continue to enjoy playing him<br/>\nevery chance I get. You have a long, rewarding career ahead of you, and have<br/>\nmentors like Sylly to consult whenever you need to. IMO the bard is the most<br/>\nfun class to roleplay and the most versatile. I&#39;d start one again in a<br/>\nheartbeat if I had it to do over.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately the topics here have concerned giants and dragons and planes (oh<br/>\nmy!), because the long-time experts are now all master bards and they&#39;re<br/>\nbored with mundane (i.e. &lt; 46) life. =D (no offense, oh minstrel masters!)<br/>\nDon&#39;t let their cynicism deter you. It will be a long time before you reach<br/>\n50th level and many things will change by then, most notably the Kunark<br/>\nexpansion. Plus, bug fixes and class enhancements are introduced in patches<br/>\nfrequently and, for the most part, have been improving the bard class. I<br/>\nremain hopeful that the results will keep me addicted for another 6 - 12<br/>\nmonths. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn(tm) Kim, for example, is presenting his recent lullaby test results to<br/>\nVerant to prove that the 15th (Lullaby) and 28th (Pixie Strike) songs are<br/>\nbugged. Someday they will be fixed. Until then you will hear various levels<br/>\nof dissatisfaction displayed on the bard boards over the issue, to put it<br/>\nmildly. But it&#39;s no reason to quit, unless you&#39;re not having fun. I plan to<br/>\nhave to have fun, lullaby or no!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck, new holder of the lute. It keeps getting better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\nCharming bard of the 27th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Sylly, I admire your attitude. You are (and always have been) an<br/>\nawesome role-model for us younger bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S. Harmonic, keep the faith, sir. It will get better. Look me up in<br/>\ngame. We&#39;ll get drunk and try to figure out who the real ladies are on<br/>\nInnoruuk. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: New bard questions<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings and Welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, you have a lot of great times ahead of you!  The bard is a very<br/>\ncapable and enjoyable class to play even though I do believe that it is also<br/>\none of the more difficult.  As a brad you get to experience things from the<br/>\ncaster class as well as the melee classes. You will get to do many things.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 45 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jennifer McComb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mccomb@...\">mccomb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me introduce myself.
