I was<br/>\nout looking for giants or griffins to charm when I heard<br/>\nsomeone blathering something about the only good wood elf<br/>\nbeing a dead one.  I&#39;d tried to solo him before, and managed<br/>\nto get him down to half before he got 4 or 5 lucky hits in and<br/>\nI had to run.  (It was a very close thing since he cast<br/>\nengulfing darkness on me, which I found out overrides<br/>\nAccelerando unless you have Accelerando playing when he casts<br/>\nit and you don&#39;t stop it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t holding his normal halberd so I asked over /guildsay<br/>\nif anyone was nearby WC and willing to help me take out Zytl<br/>\nwith a dirk.  A monk was in Kithicor so he quickly zoned into<br/>\nWC.  I stopped running in circles and lead Zytl to the<br/>\nKithicor zone.  We grouped and proceeded to pound him into the<br/>\nground.  At L35 and 30, we were both left at about half health<br/>\nwhen we&#39;d finished.  He did indeed have the dragoon dirk, so<br/>\nyou can get it off him if he&#39;s not holding a halberd.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
