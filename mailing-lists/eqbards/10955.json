Honestly, it&#39;s a fact of life. It&#39;s going to <br/>\nhappen in every MMORPG that doesn&#39;t have strict level limits on eqipment <br/>\n(i.e., &quot;You must be level 30 to equip this item!&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1999 12:57:05 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rather than let it bum you out, why not see that anyone who would laugh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at you for not being 50 yet should be pitied. While I sympathize with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your plight however, I also think that this really stems from a bit of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; jealousy, I also think learning to deal with that can be valuable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I appreciate your advice on working on my coping skills, however, I<br/>\n&gt;disagree.  I&#39;ve thought about this and what I&#39;m feeling is not jealousy.  I<br/>\n&gt;am not jealous of the fact that he possesses full Lambent and that I do <br/>\n&gt;not,<br/>\n&gt;nor am I jealous of the fact that he has a set of Yaks, FBSS, Shimmering<br/>\n&gt;Orb, etc.  There are many bards at my level and higher (and some lower) <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;have those things and I never give it a second thought.  No, what I am<br/>\n&gt;feeling (and this is the crux of the matter) is resentment and<br/>\n&gt;discouragement at the diminishment of my questing accomplishments because <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt;has full Lambent at level 9.  Again, as I said, seeing this bard in full<br/>\n&gt;steel would not have bothered me in the slightest, in fact it would have<br/>\n&gt;made me feel *good* that my investment of time, effort and strategy had<br/>\n&gt;yielding Lambent armor to me that he was unable to twink himself with but<br/>\n&gt;instead had to earn with his bard through the same efforts.  As I said in <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>\n&gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>\n&gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>\n&gt;DROP.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
