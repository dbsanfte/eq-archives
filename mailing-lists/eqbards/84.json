I used to think the the Lament was<br/>\nuseless. Now, I use it fairly regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can offer two good uses for the Jig o&#39;Vigor:<br/>\n    1) Excellent party combat song. As you get higher in rank, and find the<br/>\n        necessity to group more compelling, you&#39;ll also find that the creatures<br/>\n        you fight take longer to kill. Now, I can assure you from experience<br/>\n        that the warriors in your group will look VERY favorably on a song that<br/>\n        will lessen the drain on stamina, as swing large hammers, axes, and <br/>\n        two-handed swords can wear them out in a long battle.<br/>\n     2) Recovery for Dancing the Yellow Beetle. If you&#39;re using the Run/Heal <br/>\n         or Run/Bellow tactic of combat, you&#39;ll ususlly find that in a<br/>\ndrawn out<br/>\n         battle you get tired eventually, thus lessening your frequency of hit<br/>\n         with your weapon, and lowering its damage. The Jig is a great backup<br/>\n         for putting the spring back in your step right before you turn to<br/>\nwhack<br/>\n         at that very large borer beetle again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; Likewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; and valued application?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Not really, it&#39;s sort of useless.  Sometimes when running very long <br/>\n&gt;distances,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you will lose stamina.  Also, if you are without food and drink you may lose<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stamina at a very increased rate.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not too good.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
