As you probably know, spellcasting mobs are wimps in<br/>\nmelee and their main threat is their spells.  So basically I<br/>\nended up taking all the bad spell effects and damage for a mob<br/>\nthat someone else was fighting and got the credit for.  Over<br/>\nand over.  Eventually I just ended up turning off my songs<br/>\nwhenever someone else was fighting an orc medic or apprentice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Befallen, another group was pulling mobs into a room they<br/>\nwere camping, past my group.  The monsters would invariably<br/>\nstop chasing their fetcher and attack me.  I apologized and<br/>\nexplained it to them several times, but I still got the<br/>\nimpression they thought we were stealing their pulls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another rant is we would get a faction hit for doing nothing at all except<br/>\n&gt; being near the MOB&#39;s death.

Instead of making it so you get faction if you<br/>\ncontribute to a mob&#39;s demise, they made it so you get faction<br/>\nif you&#39;re on the mob&#39;s hate list.  The mob adds you to its<br/>\nhate list if it attacks you, which because of the above<br/>\nproblem is almost always for bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
