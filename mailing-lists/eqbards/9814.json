I want faction<br/>\nbaby.... i told everyone around me to kill what they wanted from it.  Well<br/>\nlets just put it this way, Sleep affects way more then just 4.  I cause so<br/>\nmuch spam it was crazy, and everyone was jumping gnolls that were so mad at<br/>\nme putting them to sleep they were begging for more. Between the Head nod<br/>\nspam and the faction spam, i lost maybe half a bub of health at the most in<br/>\nall the trains i got (3-4 of em of 20+ gnolls). Everyone was having fun<br/>\naround me.  Except this one snooty goodie two shoed nerdy erudian paladin<br/>\nsends me a tell saying he&#39;s reported me for purposely making trains. so i<br/>\nsaid out loud that i had asked everyone around if they minded them and they<br/>\nall were backing me up and wanted more of em since they were getting lotsa<br/>\neasy xp without getting hurt, not 1 person died in all my pulls since i had<br/>\na huge crowd of gnolls after me and very few of em actually left the mob of<br/>\nem on me.  Then he tells me to F*** myself out loud.... i said fine, i just<br/>\ndid a /report and he promply logged out....  funny how you can never please<br/>\neveryone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, i still wasnt able to do the quest even though amiable to me, i<br/>\nthink he dont like wood elves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin Nehoc<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\nLev 36 questing fool<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, November 10, 1999 2:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] OMG!

You can pretty much tell when<br/>\n&gt; everyone in your group is attacking the same mob by their orientation<br/>\n&gt; towards the mob.  A lot of the time, I get the &quot;head nods&quot; message for all<br/>\n&gt; the mobs but the extra mobs that should be asleep keep attacking.  Very<br/>\n&gt; disappointing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mumble, mumble, mumble.  Pixie Strike is BROKEN.  So is Lullaby.  I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aggravating.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
