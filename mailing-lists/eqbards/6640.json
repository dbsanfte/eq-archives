I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the Karanas Ogre <br/>\ncamp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song to prevent <br/>\nmembers from being charmed.<br/>\nI tried Disenchant last night after a group member was rez&#39;ed and it did not <br/>\ndispell the Rez effect. It was effecting my whole party but no one reported <br/>\nlosing any buffs.<br/>\nIs it possible the Disenchanting song and the Antimagic song effects have <br/>\nbeen completely switched in the multitude of patches and tweaks/nerfs since <br/>\nbeta?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering out Loud,<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, (Xegony L33)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
