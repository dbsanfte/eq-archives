Because it adds<br/>\nto your faction for the faction of the target there is lots of overlap, ie<br/>\nall merchants in a city, all corrupt guards, etc.  Also since it currently<br/>\nwill raise glares (the first stage of KoS) to Apprehensive or dubious (both<br/>\nnon-KoS), it will get you out of the early stages of KoS.  Once you hit<br/>\nscowls you are out of luck unless very high level bards get a better result.<br/>\nShada?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 2:02 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Carillion song (was Bard only equipment, a rant)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never used the carrilion anywhere I would be KOS.  Its been so long<br/>\nsince we discussed this song on the list, I&#39;ve forgotten how it works.<br/>\nIIRC, it only works on one target and wears off very quickly.  That works OK<br/>\nif there is only one mob around but what if there are multiple mobs that are<br/>\nKOS to you?  It would be nice if the carillion was AE and kept working as<br/>\nlong as you kept playing it.  That might allow us to complete the Stein of<br/>\nMoggok quest (old Glowing Stein quest) as well as other quests in evil<br/>\ncities.  I would like to go explore the evil cities but haven&#39;t done so yet<br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t want to risk my invis song blinking out at the wrong time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d definitely tak an increased faction gain from carillion, make those<br/>\n&gt; scowls go up to dubious, no KoS anywhere.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One bonus a magical flute could give is to make the invis song work<br/>\n&gt; against<br/>\n&gt; all mobs at all times, no matter if they can inherently see invis or not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; A wind instrument, IMO, would be useless.
