This means they don´┐¢t roll versus feign.<br/>\n&gt; What they get is what amounts to an intelligence check, which every creature<br/>\n&gt; gets for these ´┐¢I´┐¢m going to fool you so you don´┐¢t attack me´┐¢ abilities and<br/>\n&gt; spells. It&#39;s a very low chance. All cases of direct saves have a much higher<br/>\n&gt; percentage of the creature saving.<br/>\n&gt; ***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What this seems to be saying is that any spell/effect which &quot;fools&quot;<br/>\n&gt; creatures can be overcome by an intelligence check.  Since invisibility<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fools&quot; monsters into thinking you&#39;re not there, it seems to me this would<br/>\n&gt; account for the reason invisibility (whether bardic or from a caster) fails<br/>\n&gt; occasionally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been in situations where I was attacked (e.g.) by GIBS in Lower Guk,<br/>\n&gt; when my Invis to Undead was still up (well, until they hit me), or where<br/>\n&gt; (e.g.) I was attacked by silly lil&#39; ice gobbies in Permafrost while my<br/>\n&gt; (druid-cast) invisibility was still up (well, until they hit me).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, just thought I might have found, accidentally, a reason for one of<br/>\n&gt; the great mysteries of EQ life - why did they attack me when I was<br/>\n&gt; invisible?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
