I have concentrated\r<br/>\non /pet attack and /pet guard me.  I am committed to practicing this\r<br/>\ntechnique as I was impressed with John Kim&#39;s description of its power. \r<br/>\nI am improving while using in Cazic-Thule but it is difficult to use! \r<br/>\nPlease share your tips and suggestions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
