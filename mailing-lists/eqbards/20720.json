This will be easier<br/>\n&gt; as I get more changes of<br/>\n&gt; armor/weapons, but for now she usually claims to be<br/>\n&gt; a ranger who hasn&#39;t had<br/>\n&gt; funding enough to purchase spells.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My bard is an entertainer and world observer.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not uncommon to see her<br/>\n&gt; chatting about forests with dark elves or jumping up<br/>\n&gt; and and landing in a<br/>\n&gt; split while playing her lute with her teeth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; All my characters have a thing about beggars.  I<br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begging takes away from the game.  Terrok and<br/>\n&gt; Fenryr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; young bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and<br/>\n&gt; Tyunes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will normally help out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Same here.  I given beggars foraged grubs and<br/>\n&gt; offered to teach them how to<br/>\n&gt; fish though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; Evulia (& 7 other chars) Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
