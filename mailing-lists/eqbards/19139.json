We&#39;re discussing the fact that the people who are supposedly<br/>\nin-the-know don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t make a mistake; he just didn&#39;t know. Yes he admitted it, yes<br/>\npeople overreact and flame him for the merest slip-up but by his own<br/>\nadmission he has very little idea about issues pertaining to Bards. This<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do much to foster confidence in the people who play Bards and who<br/>\nhope that our issues will be dealt with little more than a &quot;Doh! Shows you<br/>\nhow much I know about bard songs :)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Like I said, if you can do the job better, go apply.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No thanks.  I think he does a great job of addressing a myriad problems and<br/>\nshrugging off more than his fair share of verbal abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe just needs to work on his Bards a bit more. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
