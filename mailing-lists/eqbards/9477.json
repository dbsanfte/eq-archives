Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>\n&gt;got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and dark elves <br/>\n&gt;(read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t all bad, <br/>\n&gt;though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and broadcast to <br/>\n&gt;the zone where it was...so some greedy high level (who probably couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter? Nah.  Actually I only died once<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;in the whole thing, when I was blinded by Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine <br/>\n&gt;died at least 3 times and lost exp everytime.  My guess for the portal is <br/>\n&gt;Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I doubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even <br/>\n&gt;if it is Neriak.  I just wish I had something to show for my 3 hours of <br/>\n&gt;running around the continent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hrm.  My experiences in this event were somewhat underwhelming as well... I <br/>\nwas in Mistmoore when a friend told me something was happening in Nektulos <br/>\nand HighKeep.  Having missed every server event so far in the time I&#39;ve been<br/>\n<br/>\nplaying (well, there weren&#39;t that many, come to think of it) I decided to <br/>\ncome check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I arrived in Freeport, I discovered that the Tier&#39;dal GM had moved to the<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Commons... warning sign #1.  When I entered the East Commons, I was a <br/>\nbit surprised to see a Tier&#39;dal Chaplain, a Tier&#39;dal Ritualist, and a <br/>\nTier&#39;dal High Priest all sitting around chattign by the zone.  Well, I had <br/>\nmy MM Battledrums, and this was countryside I have known well for months, so<br/>\n<br/>\nI had no fear.  I ran away with full confidence... until I was smitten by <br/>\nsome bloody spell or other that slowed me to a crawl and took nearly all my <br/>\nlife.  The follow-up, of course, killed me - I think it was the High Priest,<br/>\n<br/>\nso I didn&#39;t feel too bad... after all, he was probably twice my level.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I recovered my body, I followed the GMs to the West Commons - a glutton<br/>\n<br/>\nfor punishment, me... but honestly I was rather hoping I&#39;d be able to gather<br/>\n<br/>\nall the plotlines and writeup the story on behalf of the League of Antonican<br/>\n<br/>\nBards.  Well, I found the Tier&#39;dal NPCs with an attendant crowd of PCs: DE, <br/>\ntroll, ogre, and a handful of others all invisible and (speakig for myself <br/>\nat least) rather scared.  There was one Tier&#39;dal attendant, whose name is on<br/>\n<br/>\nthe many screenshots I took but which escapes me now, who was easily more <br/>\nintimidating than Innoruuk&#39;s Daughter.  This guy was levitating over <br/>\neveryone&#39;s heads (I mean his feet were at all times at eye level), and he <br/>\ncarried a horrible looking scythe... I was careful not to get too close.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all entered Kithicor, and that&#39;s where the Hells broke loose.  The GMs <br/>\nwere supposed to meet each other in battle apparently.  Well, the evil group<br/>\n<br/>\nstopped at the crossroads, and we all waited around while Lanis T&#39;vil <br/>\n(spelling, sorry do&#39;t recall exactly) taled to her daddy Innoruuk.  Well, <br/>\nafter a few minutes her bodyguard walked over to me and said, &quot;Be gone&quot;, <br/>\nthen turned and went back to the group.  I should have heeded his warning...<br/>\n<br/>\nwithin 5 seconds I heard &quot;A Tier&#39;dal Elder Ritualist begins to cast a spell&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand I was fleeing through Kithicor, scared out omy wits.  I ran right into <br/>\nthe open arms of some other DE necro, who I never even had a chance to greet<br/>\n<br/>\nbefore I awoke in Freeport yet again.  You have lost a level!  You are now <br/>\nlevel 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point the zone went down, and it took me some 30 mintues to get back<br/>\n<br/>\ninto Kithicor to loot my corpse.  I found most of the others, who had <br/>\nsomehow lost track of the GMs.  The battle waged on, and, as you al know, <br/>\nevil prevailed that day.  The crowning moment was when we were warned by <br/>\nInnoruuk himself to flee, and then my screen showed &quot;Hate0 tries to cast a <br/>\nspell on you, but you are protected.  Pain and suffering tries to strike YOU<br/>\n<br/>\nbut misses.  You died.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I returned to the zone and recovered my body, and watched the <br/>\naftermath - I noticed that, of about 180 people in Kithicor at the end of <br/>\nthe event, 16 were bards.  Way to go, guys!  I do&#39;t think I have ever been <br/>\nanywhere with so many fellow songweavers, or anywhere where we comprised <br/>\nsuch a large portion of the populous.<br/>\n<br/>\nKithicor is now chock full of NASTY undead, as is Qeynos Hills - after 3 <br/>\ndeaths at this &quot;event&quot; I went to Qeynos to help a young bard recover his <br/>\ncorpse (lost in the aquaducts) and discovered that Qeynos Hills is also <br/>\nteemig with undead.  I personally met Varshoon the Undying (red as death) <br/>\nand got to experience once agai the joy and marvel that is fleeing across a <br/>\nzone out of control.  Argh, I hate necromancers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I was unimpressed with the whole event - there were precious few <br/>\nthings that I had any chance of fighting, far too many I had NO chance <br/>\nagainst, and PL and lag were horrible across 5 zones.  To top it off, I <br/>\nmissed most of the story, and had topiece it together by asking friends.  Ah<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, someone else has to play historian, next time they throw an event I am<br/>\n<br/>\nstaying in Mistmoore where it&#39;s safe. = P<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
