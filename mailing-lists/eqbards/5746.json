As it is I need mobs debuffed to make things like Chain stick to them<br/>\n&gt; everytime without fail. How did you do as a 50th Bard? Did the skill cap<br/>\n&gt; effect your resistance level? Do I have to start using instrumenets with<br/>\n&gt; those songs that need them now to boost there power a bit?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if resist is based on instrument skill or not. I do know<br/>\nthat bellow (though I rarely use it any more) still goes up in damage<br/>\nthe usual one point every 2 levels after 40 and so does the heal song<br/>\nhp/tic. I do know that my exp trying to chain a L50 mob at L49 was that<br/>\nabout one in 5 or less would stick. It was funny to chain and fear the<br/>\nAllizesaur or whatever it&#39;s called, but it sure wasn&#39;t something you<br/>\ncould rely on working. He is level 50 and it took our party of 6<br/>\nL47-50&#39;s a long time to kill him. We had to have an SOW&#39;s warrior run<br/>\nhim around the island while our magic users medded back up to full. But<br/>\nthat&#39;s the monster balance in this game. A L50 mob cannot be taken down<br/>\nby a full party of near L50 players. Which is why most L50&#39;s are dying<br/>\nof boredom or playing other chars now, as there&#39;s really not much to do<br/>\nunless you can get multiple parties together.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
