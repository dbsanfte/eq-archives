A<br/>\nfear gets through (lucky roll for Naggy?) and my songs drop while I am feared.  The<br/>\nvery next dragon breath does full and significant damage when before, with songs up<br/>\nat almost the same relative position to Nag, I took far less damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n47 bard<br/>\nJus Divinum<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
