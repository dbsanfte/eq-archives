CORRECT ME IF I&#39;M WRONG!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs all the actual nuts and bolts information you have<br/>\ncompiled about bards locked behind passworded sections<br/>\nmarked &quot;Members Only&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be an idiot and unable to find the information I am<br/>\nactually interested in (specific tactics, song effects,<br/>\nbard quests, bard only magic items, bard faction information)<br/>\nand if so I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I am correct that all such information is secreted away,<br/>\nthen I have heard enough about the clique known as<br/>\nthe soerbairds. If y&#39;all want to go have your private little<br/>\ngroup and harvest a bunch of information which you then keep<br/>\nto yourself, then I for one don&#39;t want to hear the<br/>\nname of your clubby club on this list again. Any information<br/>\nthat I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>\npublic knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>\nto have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I missed a link or something, then I apologize in advance,<br/>\nand long live the soerbaird :P<br/>\n<br/>\nBerk Half-Elven<br/>\nRallos Zek (a rough place<br/>\nto sing songs I might add)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Randy Varnell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 5:14 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Songs descriptions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail Roop and bards!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This was an excellent list indeed. I&#39;m compiling a smilar list for the<br/>\n&gt; Soerbaird and love to hear what other bards have done with songs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One question I pose to all you bards out there: The Charismatic Carillon--<br/>\n&gt; I know a few of you have posted that you use this song, and that it has at<br/>\n&gt; least a minimal affect, but I have not even seen that much. My thinking is<br/>\n&gt; that the song has not yet been giving the blessing of the gods<br/>\n&gt; (it is bugged).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, could some one advise me of the appropriate way to use this song? Do<br/>\n&gt; I murmur it to myself, or do I serenade the shopkeeper with whom I wish to<br/>\n&gt; do business? Do I initiate the trade immediately after I sing, or<br/>\n&gt; do I wait<br/>\n&gt; a moment? How long do I have?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would advocate that this song is more effective than it<br/>\n&gt; currently is, for<br/>\n&gt; at the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying. Of course,<br/>\n&gt; I am a VERY charming fellow already, and maybe I have found a limit to the<br/>\n&gt; amount dashing good looks can affect purchasing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Listen and Live!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
