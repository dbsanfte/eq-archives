Trick to the game is find a spot, stick<br/>\nwith it till they are blue then move on. There is no magical place where<br/>\nyour going to find a 17th level monster that drops 10 plat. Aint gonna<br/>\nhappen. Get your butt back to EK and stay there till you get crap for xp.<br/>\nThen move on. The trick is to stay with it and know your turf. Most of the<br/>\nPK&#39;s don&#39;t even bother with  me because I&#39;m not an easy kill. The secret?<br/>\nRUN! Know thy turf....<br/>\n<br/>\nKolin<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert &quot;Nokker&quot; Venters &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dread@...\">dread@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 21, 1999 7:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] getting PK&#39;ed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Robert &#92;&quot;Nokker&#92;&quot; Venters&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dread@...\">dread@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Since you apparently are a person who has been PK&#39;d, I have some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>questions<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; about how PK works.  Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Percentages, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; player?  Items?  Money?
