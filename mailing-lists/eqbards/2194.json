We were happily<br/>\njourneying on the boat, and we hit the zone to Freeport. All of a sudden, EQ<br/>\ndisappeared, and in it&#39;s place a BIG GPF! EQ had crashed...ACK! The friend I<br/>\nwas with confirmed that it had happened to him as well (we were talking on<br/>\nthe phone at the time). I finally get back in the game, and when I log in, I<br/>\nam standing on the boat...in East Freeport. Whew... So , as I get ready to<br/>\njump ship....BAM, we zoned into Ocean of Tears....NOOOOOOOO!!!!! *Sigh* I<br/>\npetitioned a GM, and he was very kind though, and teleported my friend and I<br/>\nto Freeport...but not until I had traveled all the way back to Kaladim<br/>\nagain....<br/>\n<br/>\nYou Have been Summoned by the Gods...<br/>\nLOADING...PLEASE WAIT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe, bet many of you have never seen that message. The only bummer was<br/>\nabout 20 minutes wasted, and the free binds we had lined up from a friend<br/>\nwere gone, since he was halfway to Oasis by the time we got ourselves back<br/>\nto Freeport. I&#39;m still not bound there either, since I couldn&#39;t get anyone<br/>\nto bind last night. So I just camped. I&#39;ll try again today I suppose...<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\n9th Rank Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Douglass Family &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 19, 1999 14:03<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Boat Crashes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Douglass Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its a serious problem, I got dropped into the ocean of tears... spent 1.5<br/>\n&gt; hours swimming, thank god for the jig, finally made it to the Isle of the<br/>\n&gt; Sisters ( i was dropped just entering OOT from Kaladim), Then for a kick<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the pants I caught the boat at the isle, and entered the freeport zone,<br/>\ngot<br/>\n&gt; disconned, and appeared as boat was leaving Freeport, had to jumpship and<br/>\n&gt; swim to the docks.

Ok, so I got up and<br/>\nwalked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around till that strange sound stopped.  Stamina started picking up.  Sat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;down.  Stamina started dropping again.  Finally realized that it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;matter where I sat, sitting just plain drained my Stam.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;People disappearing, yes.  Very strange.  Could just be graphics glitch?<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was in a party with a friend and we were in group speak so can&#39;t comment<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt;/say.  But it was a little disturbing to see your partner sitting there<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; &gt;second and then vanishing right before your eyes.  But because of opinion<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this and other lists, I refrained from singing on the boat at all.  Far<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for me, little lowly 6.5 songstress, to be the cause of a boat crash!<br/>\nLOL<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher level brothers<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sisters.
