To compare, that&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; 9 damage/sec.  My weapons test against the Allizewsaur yielded<br/>\n&gt; only about 7-8 damage/sec (admittedly against a L50 mob).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why compare melee effects on yellow (& red?) mobs with song effects on  blue<br/>\n(& green?) mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; CoC + CoD do so much damage, that using them with a lute does<br/>\n&gt; more damage than using them with weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When they stick. We decided to whack a sky princess at the end of the night<br/>\nlast night.  Our ench&#39;s and sha&#39;s had camped so the task of slowing the mob<br/>\nfell to the bard (me).  I tried Chains 10 to 15 times and got 100% resists.<br/>\nNot worth punching the key at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you can use AE songs. Largo&#39;s was not an option.  Nor any AE song<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nChasing the odd Dog around an over camped Sol-B is one thing but blaring AE<br/>\nand breaking mezzed mobs in a multi-mob planar fights is another.  It looks<br/>\nlike level 47 & 48 the bard fights either blue & green mobs in the various<br/>\ndungeons or they fight yellow and red mobs on the alter-planes with the odd<br/>\ndragon and fire/ice giant guards tossed in for variety.  There is a big<br/>\ndifference in performance between these 2 situations (green/blues vs<br/>\nyellow/reds).  And some of the yellow/reds in the planes are effectively<br/>\n100% resistent to magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The 122 dam/target/round Rokenn lists above works out to 1220<br/>\n&gt; damage/minute.  This is *on par* with two of the top necro<br/>\n&gt; DoTs stacked.  You can do a helluva lot of damage with these<br/>\n&gt; songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Given the right situations.  They probably thought they were doing us a<br/>\n*favor* making them AE (hey, they can fight all the (red) mobs at the same<br/>\ntime &lt;heh&gt;) rather than target and affecting only one mob at a time.  But<br/>\nagain target or AE - level difference matter first and foremost on how well<br/>\nthey do.  Funny thing, CoD vs a red mob makes it just as mad when it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstick as when it does.  Taunt without damage - heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
