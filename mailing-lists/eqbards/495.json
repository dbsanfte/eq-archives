I&#39;d recommend finding a nice decaying skeleton with a<br/>\nweapon, and a friendly tailor.  I know that I sew for free given<br/>\nthe raw materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you are armoured and weaponed, you can start to hunt the things<br/>\nyou used to, but carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t mention what level you are, so the above advice is pretty<br/>\ngeneric.
