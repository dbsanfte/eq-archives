What do you do on long runs?<br/>\n I click forage right before I sit down to heal after<br/>\neach fight.  I have four stacks of different food<br/>\nitems and I have 4 stacks of water.  I have on<br/>\noccasion had to buy water--but only because at that<br/>\ntime I was keeping only 2 stacks of water<br/>\ngoing---Sometimes you run into a dry spell, so to<br/>\nspeak.  Anyway, except for the occasional lack of<br/>\nwater--if you can&#39;t forage enough food to never buy<br/>\nfood again then I don&#39;t know what to tell you.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot a bug and I doubt my forage works alot better than<br/>\nyours (although I am maxed at 40).<br/>\n<br/>\nThex <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 11 Nov 1999 08:14:57 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Donny Dane&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane@...\">ddane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 497<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe, less than 50%, he says.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would guess my forage works about 5% to 10% at<br/>\n&gt; best.
