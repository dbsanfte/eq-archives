Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance to<br/>\nresist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>\noverall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its 58% but can&#39;t remember my stats classes to well:-).  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Just a brief word on statistics.  If you want to get a reasonably good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approximation of what % something drops, you need a number of tests one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; order of magnitude higher than the range.  So if its 5% you need at<br/>\n&gt; least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 200 tests for statistical accuracy.  This isn&#39;t necessarily true for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; randoms, but for psuedo-random numbers such as computers produce, it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; generally the applicable rule.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
