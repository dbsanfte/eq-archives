We ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-114510775\">Hiyas,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first and still the only character in eq is a bard and because I am a<br/>\ncasual player I could just advance to the 31st level in some 6 months. We<br/>\nfounded a guild in Morrell Thule and the guild is faring hell better than me<br/>\nin comparison. Still as a newly founded guild we do not have a higher level<br/>\nor even a equal level bard, so I do have many questions concerning bards and<br/>\nhow should a bard played. I like to play a bard and even though I could be<br/>\ncon&#39;ed as a young bard, I have a good knowledge of the game because some of<br/>\nmy RL friends got into their 50+ levels in their mean time. Many shoulders<br/>\nhave been subject to my peering over and I think I could be considered as<br/>\n&quot;has done some raids or though campings&quot;. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nTo that extent I still don&#39;t know what I have to compare myself to. For<br/>\ninstance I do not know to what points I should have raised my charisma in<br/>\nthis level? Or my other stats of course. I am a capable player though and I<br/>\nmight be considered as a well faring bard (as far as I can read from faces<br/>\nof the customers, that is). What I need here is some guidance, but perhaps<br/>\nthis is not the place to flood with messages, so I could prefer individual<br/>\nmailings, if our moderator does mind multiple messages addressing the same<br/>\nissue here. But would be happy if this one turns out to be a thread on his<br/>\nown. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nThink that my list of my equips might go into that message too, but frankly,<br/>\nI do not have any items of importance for time being. What I do carry are<br/>\nthe leftovers of fast leveling melee type friends of mine, and some drops<br/>\nthat I have been able to collect while my huntings with the groups I&#39;ve been<br/>\nin. So this means nothing. (For example hand woven leggings which dropped in<br/>\nLake of Ill Omen, bah!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a curious and inexperienced bard speaking here so pls do not hesitate<br/>\nto help. :P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
