But I always turn it down.  If you twink a<br/>\ncharacter, you are giving them something, but you are also taking something<br/>\neven more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull experience of leveling on<br/>\ntheir own.  And knowing that thay can look at their inventory and remember<br/>\nall of the wonderfull adventures spent on getting the wonderfull items.<br/>\nEspecially for a bard, you need to build up stories, and adventures.  If you<br/>\nreally want to know what its all about, give your bogus items back.<br/>\nExperience the thrill of the first Tarnished weapon.  If you skip past that,<br/>\nyou will be missing alot.  I have some bronze, some banded, a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n(what a glorius day, when my party killed Dvinn) and a Puguis (Another<br/>\nglorious day when we killed a lesser blade fiend in unrest).  This is great<br/>\nfor my level.  I have been saving for the last 2 weeks to get a bronze<br/>\nbreastplate, I know have 97 plat. whoo hoo. <br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit I get pizzed when I see a /con green player wearing full<br/>\nBronze, spouting out about how he knows how to buy/sell and make money, only<br/>\nto admit that they were given all they have by their guild.  I have heard<br/>\nthat sooo many times from twinkies.  Its not buy low sell high... its get<br/>\nfree sell high, and it bugs me.  After all its not being there, its getting<br/>\nthere.  In my humble opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the vent.<br/>\nSevin Tercet &lt;Mischief&gt;<br/>\n22nd Human Bard on Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, October 04, 1999 7:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have played several characters till early teens, I must say my new bard<br/>\n(10th) is the best of the lot. I trully enjoy the reward every level, I also<br/>\nlike the fact not all songs are avail at every Bard Hall. I have opinions on<br/>\nTwinking but they are simply my opinion and even though I feel justified in<br/>\nmy beliefs I understand other people also have their own beliefs. I can<br/>\neasily see how wars based on relegion happen, but as long as we all respect<br/>\neveryones right to an opinion then things will be fine.<br/>\nI was given 20Plat as a new player by a person simply walking by, I had<br/>\nnever met him before and was reciently given a Thulian Claw by an old friend<br/>\n(Yes this is twinking) but I do not feel like I have cheated in any way, I<br/>\ndid not ask for the claw and I have copped plenty for using it. Usually like<br/>\nI am 16th level and you con green to me yet you have a high level weapon you<br/>\ncheating twink, I feel this not fair as all I have is this claw and a set of<br/>\nPW armour and a drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my 2c on twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nShinara<br/>\n11th Season Singer<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet your free email from AltaVista at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
