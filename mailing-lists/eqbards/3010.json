I heard that he<br/>\ndrops the Scrounge Claw, which is 5 Dmg  30 Dly.  I<br/>\nknow that it isn&#39;t a great weapon, but it sure as hell<br/>\nlooks cool!!!  Looks like the Demon Claw (Thulian<br/>\nClaw).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would greatly appreciate any information on this, as<br/>\nI am going to try and camp for this beast tonight.  I<br/>\nhope he isn&#39;t above lvl 21, because then he will be<br/>\nwearing a Sedaien Claw!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSedaien Reyvon<br/>\nlvl 21 bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
