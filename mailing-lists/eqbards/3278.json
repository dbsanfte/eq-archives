Can someone send that back to me? I have <br/>\ngone for the skald type bard in role play and am now heavily relied upon for <br/>\ninformation like this. I can&#39;t believe I lost it!<br/>\nI finally started working up piercing and it&#39;s definitely going to take <br/>\nawhile to raise it, probably because it is equipped secondary. Just started <br/>\nin the courtyard of Cazi, amazing lag and spam there!<br/>\nHas anyone noticed the song vendor in HH having been moved? I went to get <br/>\nsong 23 last night and he was gone.
