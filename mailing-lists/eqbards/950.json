Getting into or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670882806\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Let&#39;s face it, bards are best at low level.  I was talking to a higher<br/>\n&gt;level bard, Uulas, 22nd level, and he said he NEVER uses any songs from<br/>\n&gt;13th level - 18th level.  Good old Anthem de Arms and Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt;with a bit of the Bellow are it, pretty much.  Don&#39;t just ignore his<br/>\n&gt;advice, either, he is widely regarded as one of the best bards and an<br/>\n&gt;excellent party member on this server.  I have heard it said that &quot;Uulas<br/>\n&gt;could make any group good.&quot;  Looking over the bard song list, only the<br/>\n&gt;invisibility, flight, and mana regeneration spells look that much<br/>\n&gt;different from what we already have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uulas is correct.  My most frequently used songs (in melee areas) are Anthem<br/>\nand the mana song, with bellow and chains right behind them.  Getting into<br/>\nor out of areas brings in the invis song and of course, our dear<br/>\naccellerando song.  For getting out of trouble fast, the screech song.  I<br/>\nget a lot of requests for the charm song, but for me, it is unreliable<br/>\n(never put enough time into using it so that it would be reliable).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, to all of us who are hoping to hit the higher levels someday: don&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;down about it, but bards don&#39;t make a good &quot;core&quot; party member.  We just<br/>\n&gt;make any party MUCH BETTER.  Last night I hooked up with a cleric, a<br/>\n&gt;wizard, and a rogue.  Almost the perfect group, right?  Tank, nuke, and<br/>\n&gt;heals.  With me in there, the efficiency skyrocketed.  We fought a solid 2<br/>\n&gt;hours with perhaps 10 minutes of down time.  We were taking little to no<br/>\n&gt;damage, mowing through the beetles and lesser undead in Unrest like a<br/>\n&gt;Catholic priest who was also the Orkin man. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess that&#39;s my main point.  Not a CORE member, but one heck of an<br/>\n&gt;accessory.  Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that was a point I was trying to make earlier when I said bards are<br/>\nnever &quot;required&quot; in a group, like a tank or a healer.  Even nukes are not<br/>\nreally required if a group knows what they are doing and has one healer for<br/>\nevery 2 tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinako Lindenlyre<br/>\nMithaniel Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
