I<br/>\ncamp Kaesora for about three hours and finally get the coin there - the last<br/>\none I need.  Get a TP to Odus from my Guildmaster - Druid - get the Gem.<br/>\nRun from the Druid TP circle in Dreadlands to Fironia Vie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHappily give the gem and get the box (messed that one once before - my<br/>\nBad - forgot to leave a slot open).  I  use Cataloging Libretto to make sure<br/>\nI have six unique coins (I have one duplicate) put them in the box.  Hand<br/>\nthe Box to the NPC - and he says &quot;This item is nothing I seek&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTo add insult to injury - at 1:45 AM on a weeknight - it took almost 2<br/>\nhours for the Guide to respond that he can&#39;t do anything and I have to email<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqtesting@...\">eqtesting@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m reporting this as a bug - but did I do something wrong?  Does it matter<br/>\nwhat order the coins are inserted in the box?  In hind-sight the NPC said I<br/>\nneed to &quot;Combine&quot; them in the box.  Is &quot;Combining&quot; something special I<br/>\nneeded to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhile it would be nice to expect a response from Verant - I&#39;m guessing I<br/>\ncan get another set of the coins before I get a response from my email.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\nJust Dinged 44</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
