The plan is to meet on the<br/>\nEast Freeport Docks on Saturday at 10:00pm Eastern<br/>\n time. If you are not on Fenin Ro, like me, create a<br/>\ncharacter using the same name you now use, providing<br/>\nit is available.  Meet us there and we will begin our<br/>\nprotest with petitions to GMs, shouts in the zone,<br/>\netc.  The protest will then move to other zones to<br/>\nbring our plight to the people of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n   If you see the Roleplaying value of a viable Brewing<br/>\ntrade, and can see the benefit of a working and<br/>\nbeneficial Alchohol Tollerance skill, then please come<br/>\nout in support of this cause.  For what is a Bard without<br/>\na good Brew, a good fire and an audiance to hear his<br/>\ntales.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nEthric Gildenfire - Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Joy is in the ears that hear.&quot; - Saltheart Foamfollower</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
