Hasn&#39;t happened often, but I have seen it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever seen it with the animation tho - although I don&#39;t doubt something<br/>\nmight have cropped up it could have happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my enchanter (bard doesn&#39;t get charm for awhile) - if the monster is<br/>\nengaged, I routinely hit /pet back off before telling it to attack a target<br/>\n- that seems to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course - my enchanter is #1 on the hit parade once it DOES wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:11 PM 12/9/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Thu, 9 Dec 1999, Rokenn Swiftsong wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have had this happend to me twice this week now.

The enchanter wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;believe me when I kept saying &quot;Your pet is attacking me,<br/>\n&gt;please tell it to back off&quot; throughout the fight (we were<br/>\n&gt;fighting 4 lizards at once) until the pet broke the charm.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After the mauling I took in that episode with little sympathy<br/>\n&gt;from the others, when it happened a couple weeks later with<br/>\n&gt;the necro pet, I let it keep hitting me until the fight was<br/>\n&gt;over.  Then after a sufficient pause to make sure everyone saw<br/>\n&gt;it was attacking me, I asked &quot;Why is your pet attacking me?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt;No denying that one.  :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think there is something funny going on with the hate list<br/>\n&gt;targeting, and the inability to order a pet to attack a player<br/>\n&gt;or its pet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
