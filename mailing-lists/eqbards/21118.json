I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>\n- Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic prot.  Wt.<br/>\n3.5.<br/>\n- Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of Ykesha<br/>\n(75 point direct damage spell)<br/>\n- Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>\n- Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>\n- Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>\nCurrently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is better<br/>\nthan with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my doubts. Im<br/>\nnot satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>\nsuggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>\nI have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is resisted<br/>\nquite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nMusiker(x) Silverdrum, bard of the 38th song, bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
