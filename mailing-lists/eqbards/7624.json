If I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like a class by that point, I&#39;m outta there. It<br/>\n&gt;&gt; takes the average player a long time to get to 20 or<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The nature of the game changes as you gain levels.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;believe it&#39;s entirely due to (malicious) intent by Verant<br/>\n&gt;either - stuff like class balance in a level-based game isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;the easiest thing to anticipate at the design or even beta<br/>\n&gt;phase.  You can rant and rave all you like about how much you<br/>\n&gt;hate it, but it will probably always be there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; above. Why should they spend months unhappy just to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hope that one day things might be better?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You don&#39;t have to spend months unhappy.  If you don&#39;t like it,<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t do it.  I agree it&#39;s unfortunate that they didn&#39;t list<br/>\n&gt;out all the strengths and weaknesses of the classes at<br/>\n&gt;different levels in the manual, but I honestly believe even<br/>\n&gt;Verant didn&#39;t really know what these strengths and weaknesses<br/>\n&gt;would be in the final release version of the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t do it in real life given a choice, nor should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you have to in a game you&#39;re supposed to be playing to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; HAVE FUN in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Real life isn&#39;t level-based.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If someone hates the way something works, very rarely<br/>\n&gt;&gt; does &quot;wait, it will get better&quot; offer them any comfort<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or reason to continue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, let me rephrase what I said:  Having a well balanced group<br/>\n&gt;becomes more important at later levels.  I wasn&#39;t telling you<br/>\n&gt;to wait because it&#39;ll get better.  I was simply saying that<br/>\n&gt;casters may seem to be the best class to play at lower levels,<br/>\n&gt;but at high levels it&#39;s important to have a tank or four, to<br/>\n&gt;enlighten you to a potential mistake you could be making now<br/>\n&gt;because level-based systems suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; change in the 30s.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Personally speaking, I&#39;ll have given up my bard long<br/>\n&gt;&gt; before I ever come close to that level. It&#39;s already<br/>\n&gt;&gt; starting to lose it&#39;s luster to me at 18. I keep,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you and your friends are never going to reach the 30s, then<br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s no point to planning that far ahead.  You will do fine<br/>\n&gt;playing (mostly) casters.  I don&#39;t see Verant fixing the<br/>\n&gt;caster/melee imbalance at low levels; if anything they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;actually made it worse since release.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that? All the other players I play have bind. If I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; remember correctly, wasn&#39;t it you John that said (awhile<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ago on this list) that if you started over you&#39;d never<br/>\n&gt;&gt; play a non-binding class again?   (grin)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wasn&#39;t me.  I honestly don&#39;t care about binding except when<br/>\n&gt;that stupid boat trip is involved.  I&#39;ve played in the Karanas<br/>\n&gt;while bound in Freeport.  I&#39;ve played in Cazic bound in Halas.<br/>\n&gt;Heck, a lot of times I don&#39;t even remember where I&#39;m bound.<br/>\n&gt;The bard is the non-binder *least* affected by this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; impressed. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never used<br/>\n&gt;&gt; them before. *shrug* But that combined with not being<br/>\n&gt;&gt; able to bind make the class that less interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Obviously being able to bind is of paramount importance to<br/>\n&gt;you, while it isn&#39;t to others.  Either play classes who can<br/>\n&gt;bind, or complain to Verant about it.  While the discussion<br/>\n&gt;here has been stimulating, it&#39;s all pointless if Verant never<br/>\n&gt;sees it.  There&#39;s not much to gain arguing it with us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
