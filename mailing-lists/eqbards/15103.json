It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>\nyoung, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>\nnow lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>\npeople still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>\nspell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>\ncreate a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>\nI had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>\ntime it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>\nmaxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>\nSense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>\nknow. Just because you stay in your newbie area at that time does not mean<br/>\nthat everyone is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain, level 18 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 8 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro<br/>\n(Blackburrow)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
