The LE himself","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-858453959\">There are 4 spawns in the internal area where the LE spawns. 4 clockworks<br/>\nand a wanderer. The wanderer has a roughly 20% chance of being the LE. The<br/>\nLE himself has a real nasty damage shield (worse than the efreeti) so I<br/>\nhighly recommend that your shaman cancel magic on him until the shield is<br/>\ngone. (it&#39;s unlikely that the druid will be able to get the cancel magic to<br/>\nstick given the level disparity) The LE is about level 38, so don&#39;t expect<br/>\nto get much to stick on him. Focus on party buffs. (psalm, anthem, hymn)<br/>\n<br/>\nClockworks come in several varieties. They are all named &quot;CWG Model xx&quot;<br/>\nwhere the last two letters indicate the level range and the ability of the<br/>\nclockwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first letter is level:<br/>\n==========================<br/>\nC is the easiest, usually level 28-30.<br/>\nM is the medium, 30-32.<br/>\nX is the hardest, 32-34.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is the special ability:<br/>\n==================================<br/>\nA is a regular warrior, no special abilities.<br/>\nB has a force module, which knocks you way back when you get hit.<br/>\nC has a frost module, which procs a weak cold based dd spell when it hits<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gnome owners of the clockworks come in several flavors as well:<br/>\n===================================================================<br/>\n- Miners are typical warrior mobs, ranging from level 29-33 or so. They seem<br/>\nto have low str and ac, making them pretty easy kills for their level.<br/>\n- Curators are cleric monsters, ranging from 30-33 or so (I have yet to see<br/>\none cast Superior Heal). They aren&#39;t too difficult, but annoying because<br/>\nthey are clerics. Even if you are amiable, they will heal any gnomes you are<br/>\nfighting, although they won&#39;t actually join the fight.<br/>\n- Conjurers are magician monsters. This means they almost always have a pet<br/>\nand a damage hield. If you plan to melee them, make sure you bring something<br/>\nto dispel their damage hield. They also nuke a little hard. And they have an<br/>\nannoying habit of damage shielding any gnomes that are near them or pass by<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso be warned that gnomes and their clockworks can see through bard invis.<br/>\n(as can goblin shamans and wizzies)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a gnome killer so I can&#39;t give you much info on resist rates and<br/>\nsuch, but I do know that clockworks hit hard. I would definitely let the SK<br/>\npull. I think you&#39;ll get beat on a lot if you pull. I also think that the<br/>\nodds of landing lull are low given that most things will be yellow or red.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 18, 2000 11:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Solusek Eye and the Lava Elemental<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings I am in need of some bardic tactics and advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends and I want to take on the Lava Elemental in Solusek Eye. Can<br/>\nanyone give me any advice<br/>\non how best to approach this mob and his surrounding friends? I know there<br/>\nare 4 CWG&#39;s around and<br/>\neither a 5th wanderer or the Lava Elemental. But I have seen nothing on the<br/>\nweb of how to approach<br/>\nhim. And few people I have spoken with seem to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group will be:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard (me) Level 29 or 30, depending how much I get to play, but lately the<br/>\nSteel Golem area in Cazic<br/>\nhas been a level every 4-5 hours. :-)..<br/>\nTroll Shaman Level 41 and Pet.<br/>\nTroll SK Level 40<br/>\nOgre Warrior Level 34<br/>\nHafling Druid Level 31.<br/>\nMaybe another Cleric if they can make it. Only level 26 though or anyone<br/>\nelse we can pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions I have:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Can I lull pull to get 1 or 2 at a time? I have never killed a CWG or a<br/>\ngnome but the evils have.<br/>\n2. Will I be able to stun the mobs or do I need another couple of levels?<br/>\n3. I know the CWG&#39;s are very resistant to Magic and mostly melee but can<br/>\nthey be charmed?<br/>\n4. Can this group take and hold the room?<br/>\n5. Any other advice? My spell selection will probably be Psalm, Hym, Charm,<br/>\nPixie, Anthem or Chant,<br/>\nLullaby, Lull, and Group invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would rather send it to my home email feel free as I am asking for<br/>\nsome spoiler advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanian Aeleroth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAvoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\nreservations.
