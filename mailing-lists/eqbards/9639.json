We did get to peek in though and see the<br/>\nplace was nicely done in early ranger (did you know that if you put your<br/>\nnose to the wall and press your sit key, you will get a glimpse inside as<br/>\nyou sit down?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fog and dark were back - hmm I wonder what kinda bug or did they<br/>\nre-patch something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the undeads there a lot!!  Blues and lots of them.  Some reds too but<br/>\nneed just a bit of a stronger party.  Zones real close. Lots of different<br/>\nthings to try on them.  Zombies with diseases to resist.  I got pretty good<br/>\nxp in the hour or so we fought.  But I am really liking the place and looks<br/>\nlike I will be there for the rest of this level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. we snuck our lev 18 bard brother into Old Guk last night.  Well kinda<br/>\nsnuck - he hugged the left wall and pulled the greater ice boners.  Good<br/>\nthing there were 2 partys right there and we nailed the skellies (blue to me<br/>\nat 35 - woo hoo!) The Assn room campers let him stay and gave him 2nd loot<br/>\nrights.  He camped for 3 hours and made pals healing a necro who was doing<br/>\nthe hp-to-mana thing.  His turn to loot and no guise &lt;sigh&gt;  Mean while, we<br/>\nwent down to Exe room and camped it for 3 hours.  Died when we pulled a 6<br/>\nfroggie train and lost 1 of our 2 clerics early in battle and 3 tanks<br/>\ndecided to all attack different mobs.  I lullaby&#39;d with lute but the damn<br/>\ntanks kept waking them up and you know the rest of the story.  Our other<br/>\ncleric gated out and helped us do CR - dragged us out and rezz&#39;d us back.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tAndrew Simpson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hornsfan@...\">hornsfan@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, November 04, 1999 7:08 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Kith Nerfed!!!
