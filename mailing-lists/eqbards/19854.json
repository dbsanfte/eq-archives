The first two were just a<br/>\ndisaster but this third trip was great.  I manage to hit level 17 and<br/>\nscreamed back to FV to train dual wield.  After a bit of looking around I<br/>\nasked if there was a bard trainer.  Nope :(  I had to go back to the main<br/>\nland to train - which I did... I have been wanting dual wield for days......<br/>\nJust curious - are bards the only guild that do not have a trainer there?  I<br/>\nsaw many other trainers along the way and even someone to sell songs....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say I love Kunark!  I have been grouped in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\nand loved it.  It&#39;s a harsh place but once you get settled in you don&#39;t want<br/>\nto leave - half the reason I am miffed as to there being no trainer<br/>\nthere....<br/>\n<br/>\nJacana, Wood Elf Bard of the 17th song, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
