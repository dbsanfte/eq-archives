I suspect that most other players of this great game don&#39;t understand<br/>\nhow much bard players have been ignored and how our class keeps getting<br/>\nbroken with new patches yet not fixed or tested or even acknowledged until<br/>\nmonths later when Verant declares things to be &#39;working as intended&#39;.  Even<br/>\nif Verant employees don&#39;t read the thread and understand the issues, perhaps<br/>\nyour post will help another player to understand.  The more people who<br/>\nunderstand what is happening (even if they don&#39;t work at Verant) hopefully<br/>\nVerant will start to realize that it isn&#39;t just a typical class whine about<br/>\nbards but there is a much larger issue that affects all their players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your ideas and support.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nAanluil Lumiaria<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Sniderman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, September 10, 2000 9:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Probably pointless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Pardon my cynicism (but it&#39;s hard not) - but despite all the good points<br/>\n&gt; raised - Abashi made one or two namby-pamby response.
