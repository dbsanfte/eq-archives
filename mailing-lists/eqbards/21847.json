Basically this song ALLOWED us<br/>\nto be backup crowd control for Enchanters.  It clearly fit in with the &quot;Jack<br/>\nof ALL trades master of none&quot; concept.  Because of the 3 second resist<br/>\ncheck - it was clearly inferior to the enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember using it extensively in the Flag Room in Permafrost.  Like an<br/>\nEnchanter - if the party didn&#39;t know how to assist  - I&#39;d die followed by<br/>\nthe rest of the party (most likely).  It required knowledge and discipline<br/>\nfor the whole party.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe four mob limit was a valid and proper limitation of the song.  Often<br/>\nanother group would train us - and we were toast when we had more than four<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I&#39;ve argued vehemently against these nerfs - I just don&#39;t<br/>\nsee a valid argument for the so-called class limit.  I don&#39;t see what a 49th<br/>\nbard with high Charisma should be able to use it at 49th level to fill in<br/>\nfor an Enchanter when the group doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see that a 30 percent resist (and I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s really that<br/>\nlow) is reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4(n)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 5:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] I posted this to the Everwhatever boards and to<br/>\nthe Concert Hall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not certain how many of you bards had the chance to use Lullaby<br/>\npre-stealth nerf so for the sake of discussion let me clarify something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSinging Lullaby pre-stealth nerf was always a risky situation for bards.
