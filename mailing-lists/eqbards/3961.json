When soloing, nearly anything that gives you<br/>\nexperience is going to hit you lots and lots of times.  With<br/>\nthe Psalm of Warmth&#39;s fire shield, your opponent takes damage<br/>\nevery time he hits you.  At L27 it was &quot;only&quot; 4 points per<br/>\nhit, but considering you&#39;re probably going to be hit 20-40<br/>\ntimes in a solo fight, that&#39;s 80-160 points of free damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was having trouble soloing defenders in Cazic until I<br/>\nthought of this.  I started weaving the Psalm and suddenly the<br/>\nfights I&#39;d been losing handily before, I started winning.<br/>\nWeave it with Hymn and you can make the battle last even<br/>\nlonger causing your opponent to take even more damage.  If you<br/>\ncan manage four songs, I&#39;d do Anthem, Psalm, Chain, Hymn.  If<br/>\nyou can only do three, I&#39;d drop Chain - you will be taking<br/>\nmore hits, but your opponent will be taking damage for each of<br/>\nthose hits, so it&#39;s not as great a loss as you&#39;d first think.<br/>\nSwap Chain for Psalm when your opponent starts to flee.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
