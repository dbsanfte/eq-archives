Also it makes<br/>\n&gt;events like the undead invasions totally pointless.  What<br/>\n&gt;challenges a level<br/>\n&gt;40+ in those case, slaughters everyone who would normally be in<br/>\n&gt;one of those<br/>\n&gt;zones.  Better to do that by having a horde of lower level mobs for the mid<br/>\n&gt;range characters to battle, while having a half dozen or so gm controlled<br/>\n&gt;mobs which concentrate on targeting the high levels who come to &quot;play&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKit </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
