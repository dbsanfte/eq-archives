I have no<br/>\nidea why all thse people assume they know how to play my 51 bard better than<br/>\nI do.  I guess they all play lvl 60 bards as their primaries.  I still run<br/>\ninto to people that insist my normal haste songs (not the Ervaj ones) stack<br/>\nhaste effects with enchanters.  &quot;DEWD!!! I tested it MYSELF!!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am in a group where I am lacking any realy good songs to play, I will<br/>\noffer to play mana song full time.  Usually this would involve having a<br/>\nchanter/shaman and cleric (maybe 2 of the three along with another int<br/>\ncaster).  It gives me a break from weaving, which is nice.  However I<br/>\nexplain to them thsat they need to med close to the fights (thus must pull<br/>\nclose to the medders).  USually they ignore me, so I go back to singing<br/>\nother songs (since mana song ain&#39;t hitting the caters anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone tells me what songs to play, I ignore the first time they say<br/>\nit.  Then say, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;, the second time.  If they continue,<br/>\nit is dependent on my mood.  I will usually just go back to ignoring them,<br/>\nbut occasionally I will go on a rant about how I don&#39;t tell them what<br/>\nweapons to wield, skills to use, spells to cast, etc...  It also depends on<br/>\ntheir &quot;tone&quot;  If they are trying to be helpful, I will merely explain whY i<br/>\nam playing what songs I am singing.  Occasionally someone actually makes a<br/>\ngood suggestion, and I will swtich my melody...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
