So<br/>\none guy has a problem, and you can&#39;t please everybody. But try to help<br/>\nbards out by tips, tactics and quest hints, not guild promotion. You<br/>\nmay be a good guild, I don&#39;t know, but please try to keep it<br/>\nuncommercialized. Thankyou. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, any woodelf bard can give 4 spiderling silks to the guild<br/>\nleader in kelethin and get a hand drum. This quest can be done over and<br/>\nover and the drums can be sold for about 3-4 gold. Not to shabby for<br/>\nnewbies.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
