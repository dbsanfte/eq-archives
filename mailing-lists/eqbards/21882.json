Also ever fear/snare in burning woods?  Its more<br/>\neffective than a balanced group of 6 fighting the mobs straight up there.<br/>\nWe even have sold our cleric on the idea, and he just blasts the mobs now<br/>\n(and heals when things go awry.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains:  I always have this memmed in dungeons too.  Why?  Because stuff<br/>\nhappens.  Your ranger goes LD before snaring.  Someone screws up and roots<br/>\nthe mob (breaking snare).  There is no snarer in the group (or your snarer<br/>\nis too low).  In any case NOBODY else can chase down a mob while casting<br/>\nsnare in an emrgency.  (Is there a junark armor with snare?  If so make that<br/>\nnobody a bit smaller)<br/>\n<br/>\nSongof the Sirens:  You have to be kidding me.  This is our most powerful<br/>\nsong (till higher lvl then its the 39 charm song).  Worse case of this song<br/>\nis you have one mob damaging the mob the parry is on rather than you 90% of<br/>\nthe time.  Best case, you have 2 mobs beating on each other, while the party<br/>\nkills a third.  Oh yea, tell the enchanter who has half a bub of life when<br/>\nyou charm the mob off him (giving the healer time to heal) that you<br/>\nshouldn;t mem the song when he&#39;s around.  I cannot count the number of<br/>\nenchanters/healers/over blasters I have saved with this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nClouding:  Ok here there are some problems, BUT an organzied group can use<br/>\nthis song amazingly well.  Player 1 walks, leading the group to their camp<br/>\nin the dungeon.  Rest of group, inlcuding bard singing clouding follows.<br/>\nPlayer 2 who also knows the way &quot;sweeps&quot; behind the group making sure all<br/>\nstay close.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
