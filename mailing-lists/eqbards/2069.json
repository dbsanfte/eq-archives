Capozzi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croak63@...\">croak63@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLore means that only one instance of a unique item may be possessed by a<br/>\nplayer.  Lore items of one type do not affect  lore items of another type.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you can have a Dragoon Dirk, a Rubicite Breastplate, a Polished Granite<br/>\nTomahawk, all tagged LORE, for instance, all at one time.  If you then try<br/>\nto pick up or trade another Dragoon Dirk(or any other lore item that you<br/>\nalready have in inventory, including your bank), it simply vanishes, gone<br/>\nforever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis warrants some caution when looting mobs.  LOOK at the item before you<br/>\npick it up, it  may be a lore item you already posses, or it may be a No<br/>\nDrop item.  Best to leave it on the corpse if in a group, and let the<br/>\ndesignated recipient pick it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the rapier/dirk look is cool, IMHO...reminds me of the old Musketeer era<br/>\nduelists, who commonly used both a long blade and a dagger or main gauche,<br/>\nfor parrying and extra attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re REALLY concerned, there are several other dagger classed weapons,<br/>\nsome very good, that you can aquire.  Jambiya, Obsidian Shard, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Roop Dirump &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 17, 1999 10:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dragoon Dirk (off topic somewhat?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just don&#39;t understand how lore items will work.  Was thinking the dirks<br/>\n&gt;would look great dual wielded, but it&#39;s a lore item so I can have only one?<br/>\n&gt;But what about quests where you must have multiple lore items in your<br/>\n&gt;possesion?  Will they be changed, no longer lore items?  Now that I will be<br/>\n&gt;using a dirk, will this mean if I accidentally talk to an npc in such a way<br/>\n&gt;that they hand me a lore item, it will destroy my weapon?  Or will these<br/>\n&gt;&quot;keep only one&quot; only apply to items that are pending lore?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a rapier and a dirk I look sort of silly, would be nice to wield two.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
