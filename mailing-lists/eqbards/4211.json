Using acronyms<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>\nsupposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>\ndefinitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>\nwords that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nOveruse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>\nand limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>\ncompanies moved away from secret code.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse than<br/>\nobscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>\nAcronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>\nthem and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>\nindustry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point and<br/>\nbehave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret code,<br/>\neither not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re communicating<br/>\nwith the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority of<br/>\nthe readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother to<br/>\nfind out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
