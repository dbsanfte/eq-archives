You must have a &#39;high&#39; aimiably. I got myself &#39;high&#39; by<br/>\nturning in tons of gnoll fangs to the barbarian warror woman in Halas. (I<br/>\njust re-read that statement and left it the way it was ;))<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself and my roomate barabarian shamen make an evening out of this. We<br/>\neach do each step of the way (even following and killing the murderer).<br/>\nand that way we each get a sword ( and GREAT exp) at level 22 =) (I am at<br/>\n3 bubbles of exp almost all from doing this quest multiple times)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rare drop guy (you will know becuase his name is NOT Basil, I forget<br/>\nhis name) was yellow to me at 22nd chord, and the regular guy is blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n(the heads look the same, you get the sword when you complete it. MY<br/>\nsuggestion is, if you get the 2H version LET someone else do it you KNOW<br/>\ncan complete it, I would HATE to see you lose it, also realize the 2H<br/>\nversion IS LORE, so sell give to someone before you get the 2H version<br/>\nagain!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps =D<br/>\n<br/>\nFrashii, 22nd Missed note bard<br/>\nFollower of Rodcet Nife on Tareww Marr<br/>\nSeekers of Lore, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.

Last night, I did this quest,<br/>\n&gt;to obtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.  For<br/>\n&gt;those of you who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of quest,<br/>\n&gt;and though not particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item (the murderer&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;head), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then regarded me<br/>\n&gt;amiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said, &quot;Although the wolves<br/>\n&gt;of the north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD FOR YOU!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(Okay, that wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Is it a warrior only quest or something?
