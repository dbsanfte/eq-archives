It effects an area.  Just like when it rains, it rains on<br/>\neveryone in the area, not just the bad people.  So proceed with caution<br/>\nwhen using area spells.  Don&#39;t just get greedy and try to kill a<br/>\nmillion things to get a ton of experience.  Dork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And while I&#39;m on the soapbox, why did Verant make it<br/>\n&gt; where merchants and<br/>\n&gt; guards attack you if you sing Chords of Dissonance<br/>\n&gt; in their vicinity?  I am<br/>\n&gt; a wood elf from Kelethin.  I obviously bear no<br/>\n&gt; ill-will to the merchants and<br/>\n&gt; guards of Kelethin.  They sell me goods and protect<br/>\n&gt; me from the evil orcs of<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone.  But here is what happened to me the<br/>\n&gt; other day.  I was mucking<br/>\n&gt; around the orc camp south of the entrance to<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone attempting to rid the<br/>\n&gt; forest of the orc infestation.  I was going solo and<br/>\n&gt; was in the process of<br/>\n&gt; fighting an orc centurion.  I was singing the Chords<br/>\n&gt; to help dispatch the<br/>\n&gt; centurion.  I almost had him finished off when a<br/>\n&gt; guard spawned behind me.<br/>\n&gt; He immediately killed me and then killed the orc<br/>\n&gt; cent himself.  To say the<br/>\n&gt; least I was quite upset.  Guildmaster, guards and<br/>\n&gt; merchants /con red to me<br/>\n&gt; so it would be stupid if I attacked them on purpose.<br/>\n&gt;  It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt; these type of NPCs should be unkillable in the first<br/>\n&gt; place.  If I kill a<br/>\n&gt; guildmaster then how will other players train?  I<br/>\n&gt; would be willing to bet<br/>\n&gt; that they are unkillable, even by high-level<br/>\n&gt; players.  If they are<br/>\n&gt; unkillable by players, IMO the Chords of Dissonance<br/>\n&gt; should have no effect on<br/>\n&gt; them whatsoever and they should not attack PCs<br/>\n&gt; singing it.  Am I justified<br/>\n&gt; in my opinion on this? Dissenting opinions are<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 6th Circle<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
