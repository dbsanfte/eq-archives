One who puts his thief skills to actual use, for example.<br/>\nA charming bard could make a wonderful confidence man (or woman)<br/>\n... and while the &quot;good&quot; bards certainly wouldn&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing,<br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t necessarily keep him (her) from doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are, after all, not paladins.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Daithi, Ollave of the Soerbaird<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Marc Allie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, April 20, 1999 1:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Hail from Pistov of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Marc Allie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Hail, fellow bards.  I am Pistov, a 10th level Bard currently residing<br/>\n&gt;in the metropolis of Freeport in the world of Cazic-Thule.  I have been <br/>\n&gt;listening to all of the fine discussion by all, and like any bard worth<br/>\n&gt;his lute strings, I have a few things to say as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    First of all, regarding charging for locating a corpse, think of it<br/>\n&gt;this way.  Bards, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers are the only classes <br/>\n&gt;who have this talent.  Charging for this service seems a greedy and<br/>\n&gt;selfish act, much more suited to those evil undead mongers, I would say.  <br/>\n&gt;We as bards work best in a group, and the more friends we have the better.<br/>\n&gt;Locating a corpse for free has made me many a travelling partner.  Coming<br/>\n&gt;from one who was a wizard in a past life, it is FAR easier for us to sing <br/>\n&gt;the song of speed and run in a straight heading to locate a corpse than it<br/>\n&gt;is to wander around, lost, at a normal run searching fruitlessly.  <br/>\n&gt;Performing this task for free gives all bards a good name.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Another thing I wanted to mention.  I myself tire of seeing a Dark Elf<br/>\n&gt;Necromancer, a Troll Warrior, and a High Elf Paladin all in the same party.  <br/>\n&gt;Please, try to role play at least a little.  Bards are well suited to<br/>\n&gt;promoting role playing, since by our nature we are highly social.  It is <br/>\n&gt;easy enough to make a few hotkeys that add a little flavor to the game.<br/>\n&gt;Consider this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pistov shouts, &#39;10 Bard wanting to join group for dervish hunting.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OR<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pistov shouts, &#39;I grow weary of singing to myself, I need an audience!  If<br/>\n&gt;you would care to listen to a 10th level bard, please give a tell.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    I guarantee you will have more success with the latter.  And it really<br/>\n&gt;promotes good role playing.  We as bards should be good examples for others <br/>\n&gt;to follow.  Try it, and I am sure you will begin to have much more fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fare well, all, and may the muses bless you!  Perhaps some of us may meet<br/>\n&gt;some day!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pistov<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\n&gt;Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\n&gt;Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n&gt;          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
