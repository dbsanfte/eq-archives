Could only play on weekends.<br/>\n&gt; Some recent highlights:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  Died 7 times in Plane of Hate.  My cleric never quite got just how<br/>\n&gt; few Hit Points I have.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Died 3 times to bad trains in Lower Guk.<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Died once in Sebelis.  Five frog pull, four frogs decided that, of<br/>\n&gt; 24 people there, I was the tastiest.  Never died so fast in my playing<br/>\n&gt; career.  The red just plummeted straight down to nothing, without<br/>\n&gt; stopping once.<br/>\n&gt; 4.  Died three times in City of Mist, including once when I <br/>\n&gt; had managed<br/>\n&gt; to fall asleep.  Hey, sometimes people just take too darn long to get<br/>\n&gt; organized, you know?<br/>\n&gt; 5.  Died to another bad train in Lower Guk.<br/>\n&gt; 6.  Died in Skyfire, just a big pile of bad guys all at once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm.  16 deaths in one level.  How embarrassing is that?  Curiously, I<br/>\n&gt; never got negative experience for a day.  Thank goodness for level 49<br/>\n&gt; rezzes.  Just didn&#39;t get much positive experience.  Hehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But!  (And yes, it&#39;s anti-climactic for many of you, but tough), I got<br/>\n&gt; level 50!  Giants in Burning Woods finally did the trick.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 50 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Up to 60% OFF food!<br/>\n&gt; Buy Now and Shipping is Free.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4016/10/_/451022/_/958970345/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4016/10/_/451022/_/958970345/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
