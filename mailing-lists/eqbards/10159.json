I did not participate but today <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;friends told me that afterwards SplitPaw had been revamped in much the <br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt;way that Kithicor has and to come check it out. I have not had a chance <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;do so much yet but I can say that the level has been increased to about <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;30-50 lvl dungeon from what I have seen and heard with gnolls conning <br/>\n&gt;blue<br/>\n&gt;to me at 40th at the first bridge area. Not sure if it has been reitemized<br/>\n&gt;but I am hoping it will be, if so it will be another nice upgrade to <br/>\n&gt;a zone<br/>\n&gt;that Verant has made recently. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Agreed -- lower level players rarely went to Paw, probably because of <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;distance. So, now that most of our players are approaching mid-level,<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;changed the zone&#39;s population (and treasure) in hopes it will be more<br/>\n&gt;popular now. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Brad McQuaid<br/>\n&gt;Producer, EverQuest www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;Vice President, Verant Interactive Inc.<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------------------------- <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get HushMail.
