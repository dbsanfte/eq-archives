Granted there will always be<br/>\nlow<br/>\n&gt; level characters on every server, but over time the average character<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; will increase.  This could be Verant&#39;s method to help prevent overcrowding<br/>\n&gt; by ensuring there are enough creatures around to give experience.  Just a<br/>\n&gt; speculation on my part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One other thing to consider, when a creature spawns, there are a range of<br/>\n&gt; levels they could be.  Last night I was camping the pirate captain in the<br/>\n&gt; OOT who drops the Bracer of Erollisi.  The first time he spawned he conned<br/>\n&gt; dark blue to me (21 bard).  The second time he spawned, he was black to me<br/>\n&gt; (same level).  The third time he spawned he was yellow.  This could have<br/>\n&gt; been what happened to you in Steamfont with the skeletons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a<br/>\nbig<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and<br/>\nturned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to Richard van den Brink<br/>\n&gt; This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt; To enter go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
