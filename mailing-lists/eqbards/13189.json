And an attack<br/>\nskill like kick, I have legs, why can&#39;t I kick?? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m asking<br/>\nfor Double attack here, kick is an overlooked combat skill by alot of<br/>\nwarriors, and if bards did get kick I&#39;m not sure if they would all use it,<br/>\nthis would involve another hotkey to mash away at. But to be honest at<br/>\nlevel 32 I don&#39;t usually mash the keys now I have mana song so it would be<br/>\nnice to have this skill addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say remove the daft instill doubt skill (what is the point??

Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long<br/>\n&gt;lasting.  In general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds<br/>\n&gt;after we stop singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it<br/>\n&gt;is a permanent change to the environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The one exception to this is the charismatic catillion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that all of our songs are temporary.  But I would point out that<br/>\n&gt;all spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Magician<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;summoned items are no-rent, and all others are buffs, DD&#39;s, DoT&#39;s, Heals,<br/>\n&gt;etc.  There are no environment altering spells in the game that I know of<br/>\n&gt;except Bind.  Perhaps a case could be made for Mem Blur, but that&#39;s one<br/>\n&gt;spell out of 700.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excellent example... and one which holds equally true for bards.  When you<br/>\nplay Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, you *permanently* erase the damage<br/>\nregister<br/>\nof the charmed monster.  This song removes, for the remainer of the<br/>\nmonster&#39;s lifespan, all recollection of who did damage to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe delineation of melee skills is compelling in my eyes as one reason<br/>\nbards<br/>\nare not hybrids.  As John said, we&#39;re &quot;not-a&quot;, or put another way we share<br/>\ncharacteristics of many classes without being classified as a member of<br/>\nthat<br/>\nclass.  We&#39;re kinda like rogues (silly skills), kinda like enchanters (some<br/>\nbuffs, debuffs, and crowd control), kinda like shamans (some more buffs,<br/>\nminor healing).  Yet we&#39;re not-a-fighter, not-a-healer, not-a-caster.  We<br/>\ngot plate mail for no other reason I can see than because we get hit so<br/>\noften - like clerics we were judged to be too fragile to drape in leather<br/>\ngranted our huge taunt power and low hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant calls us hybrids only because they&#39;re trying to simplify the<br/>\ndescription of classes.  I think a more honest and accurate division would<br/>\nbe as follows: there are 3 fighter classes (warrior, monk, rogue); 3 healer<br/>\nclasses (cleric, shaman, druid); 4 caster classes (wizard, magician,<br/>\nenchanter, necromancer), 3 hybrid classes (ranger, paladin, shadowknight);<br/>\nand 1 bard class (bard).  Our songs are NOT like the spells of any other<br/>\nclass in the way they are implemented (pulses?  what&#39;s a pulse?  why would<br/>\nI<br/>\nweave spells?); we have unique nondisposable spell foci (instruments) which<br/>\nare required for some spells (e.g. Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding) and augment<br/>\nothers; and almost every one of our spells improves linearly with the level<br/>\nof the caster.  Plus of course there&#39;s the fact that we only get one spell<br/>\nper level (well, in theory anyways).  Ok, ok, they&#39;re songs, not spells -<br/>\nwe<br/>\ndifferentiate our effects from all other casters&#39;, don&#39;t we?  = )<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of whether bards are or are not hybrids, I think Verant&#39;s<br/>\npublicly expressed logic for why some classes get bind is easy to apply to<br/>\nbards.  They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I<br/>\ncontend that bards die as often as any single casting class.  Regardless of<br/>\narguments about travel time (e.g. bards don&#39;t need binding because they run<br/>\nso fast - which would also eliminate druids from needing bind, as they can<br/>\nSoW, SoC, and port about), the reason why some classes have bind is claimed<br/>\nto be due solely to the frequency of deaths of said class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome food for thought, anyways...<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n~Flying Brethren~<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
