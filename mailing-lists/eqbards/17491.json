What excitement waits<br/>\n&gt;for a Bard of 12 songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my favorite time at 12 was spent on a group of islands in the Ocean of<br/>\nTears. It is a bit more complicated now with two boats, but doable just the<br/>\nsame. This is really exciting solo hunting that is an adventure all around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you first zone in to the Ocean of Tears from Butcherblock , if you are<br/>\non the right boat :o) you will soon pass an island with Aqua goblins and<br/>\nAlluring Mermaids. Jump off *grin* and find some dry land out of view of the<br/>\ngoblins. Also, do a /who on the zone and then another after the boat leaves.<br/>\nYou now have some idea of the number of players in the zone with and without<br/>\nthe boat, which will be important for later<br/>\nYou will find between lulling and careful fight picking you will do very<br/>\nvery well against the Aqua goblins. Bring lots of backpacks because they<br/>\neach drop a bow worth 2+ gold which you can sell back in Butcherblock once<br/>\nyou catch the boat....*waits for obvious question to arise*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Boat Jumping Spoiler*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is time to go sell do a /who on the zone and see if the boat is<br/>\nin-zone, you can just shout, but people get tired of this and you get a lot<br/>\nof &quot;in the water&quot; so I save it for when I am really uncertain. Stand on the<br/>\nrock with the two mermaids and when you first see the boat coming jump in<br/>\nand SWIM FOR IT! You need to position yourself directly in front of the<br/>\nboat, swimming forward, pointing up at about a 35-45 degree angle. The boat<br/>\nwill run over you and then you will *pop* up over the bar and be safe and<br/>\ndry.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to practice this in Freeport first, me I just went on faith and<br/>\nwhen the time came to leave it *just* worked. It is scary every time though<br/>\nbecause if you miss it then it is another 20 minute wait unless you want to<br/>\ngo all the way back to Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther classes can hunt there way before 12, but a bard needs Bellow to get<br/>\nthe goblin runners as they swim away. Yes, you will bee spending LOTS of<br/>\ntime in the water *grin* It is really a lot of fun, good exp and money, and<br/>\none of the best &quot;adventures&quot; I have had in Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
