I guess when I get charm in four more levels I&#39;ll be able to control<br/>\n&gt; a crowd of three, but if pixie strike is as bugged as Lullaby I guess that<br/>\n&gt; will be the best I will ever do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm maybe I had a streak of very good luck last night.  I was in the penthouse<br/>\nin the Aviak city and I had rooks nodding off left and right when we got in<br/>\ntrouble.  I was the lowest level up there at 18 and was not using any<br/>\ninstruments.  The sleeping rooks would occasionally wake up swing at me then<br/>\nnod back off.  I just had to be sure I told the others to leave them alone and<br/>\nlet them sleep.  The rooks were red to me.  At one time we had a Harrier that<br/>\nwe were attacking and 2 sleeping rooks.  Sure sounds to me like it is working<br/>\nproperly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Katawn 18th Season Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n  Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
