So we had non stop action and at times there were<br/>\n&gt; 3/4 kobolds coming at us that agro from other rooms, I was using charm and<br/>\n&gt; after a 4 kobold fight my mana was down 2 bubs. I sat and med but it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; regen fast enough, looks as though this song now uses 20 mana per cast<br/>\n&gt; instead of the original 5 mana. Ok ok, you must be wondering why I am using<br/>\n&gt; the level 39 charm song on kobolds? Well, some Solusek Kobolds are too<br/>\n&gt; high, so I just use the level 39 song to avoid this....we was also pulling<br/>\n&gt; bats/bugs so it&#39;s handy to have for that too. It looks as though this song<br/>\n&gt; is gonna have to be used in rations....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 45 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I have.  I tried to solo some seafuries last night for awhile.  Before it took me about minimum of 5<br/>\nor 6 furies before I would be down a bubble of mana.  Last night I was done a bubble and a half after the<br/>\nfirst one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I noticed certain mobs with higher resist rates.  Doing the IGs pre-Vox before the patch, I was<br/>\nsticking about 80% of my charms.  Last night I could only stick about 20% of my charms on the IGs.  Once<br/>\nI finally did stick a charm it did seem that it was extremely easy to stick it again though... it was the<br/>\ninitial charm that was sooooo tough.  Because of all the resists, my mana was half gone before the first<br/>\nwave of IGs was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the song will be great for limited crowd control and I see the mana thingy as a way to keep<br/>\nus from going out there and trying to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
