It&#39;s amazing<br/>\nhow few trains I have actually started, though I end up running a LOT of them to zone. Some notes:<br/>\n<br/>\nAccelerondo is your best friend in BB. Not only can I run away from the constant stream of trains<br/>\ndumped on you if you are anywhere NEAR the mob paths but last night I killed a Gnoll Commander using<br/>\naccelerondo. I joined about 6 people attacking him and he ran very early, very fast and really had<br/>\nsome erratic pathing. Out of all the people who had jumped him I was the only one who could keep up<br/>\nand after a long long chase I wound up doing the most damage with my mino axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the code is that takes over when you go linkdead it is GOOD. I crashed hard while fighting<br/>\na gnoll on the bridge at the top of the ramp (the one with giant snakes) from the main room. I<br/>\nreconnected to find myself at the end of the mob flee path in the main room. WOW, that was pretty<br/>\ncool. Now I also had two new elites on me suddenly and died a few steps later, but STILL. Pretty<br/>\nneat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seems to be a good place for the auction channel. Irresponsibly giving into the buying urge<br/>\n(I am saving for a combine longsword) I bought a purity belt and have sold several things there.<br/>\nHowever, if there is a smith who has a supply of small banded you could make a fortune in Qeynos.<br/>\nEvery night there are many cries for small banded (from myself included) but there simply IS none to<br/>\nbe found, I have yet to hear of one piece available in the last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am having as much fun as I can have given that Verant killed Dark Unity on Rallos Zek by<br/>\nimposing faction (with all it&#39;s exploits) without any evidence it worked as a Player interaction<br/>\nsystem. But it is fun, just without the same depth, which is a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and made 12th last night, weee! I see that other songs will take a back seat in combat for a<br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Bard of Faydark, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
