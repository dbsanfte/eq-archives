Wizard<br/>\ngates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>\nwhile the bard is still running.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>\nthe same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>\nhis fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>\nto Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport.
