Back when I was in high<br/>\nschool and being the DM, I&#39;d &quot;roleplay&quot; 20+ characters a session.  Never<br/>\nonce was I unable to roleplay a character because the armor he was wearing<br/>\ndidn&#39;t fit my personal views of what a character from history supposedly<br/>\nwore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Norrath we are talking about, not Earth.  Bards are not Celtic bards<br/>\nor European minstrels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is my opinion, and I feel both<br/>\n&gt;sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i appreciated<br/>\n&gt;that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>\n&gt;you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>\n&gt;argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>\n&gt;bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So give me any valid argument of how a bard song makes a group invisible or<br/>\nhow playing a drum makes you run twice as fast.  In fact, how is magic and<br/>\nmonsters &quot;valid&quot; to begin with?  But lets try anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nI am Luti, a 4th generation Bard.  My friend Windraven, a Paladin, and I,<br/>\ndaily go out to rid Qeynos Hills of the evil gnolls.  I am wearing Leather<br/>\narmor because that is what my father and his father before him always wore.<br/>\nWindraven has a suit of Plate handed down from his grandfather.  When we go<br/>\nout to hunt the gnolls, Windraven has to protect me.  His platemail easily<br/>\nturns back the rusty weapons of the Blackburrow gnolls.  But the same swords<br/>\nbite deeply into my Leather tunic.  I wish I was able to wear the Plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one day Windraven and I are down at Crows playing some cards.  It was a<br/>\nhot day and Windraven decided to take off his armor.  After another flash of<br/>\nmead, Windraven had to &quot;excuse&quot; himself yet again. Looking at his Plate, I<br/>\ndecide to see what it feels like to wear it.  So I remove my Leather boots<br/>\nand put on his Steel Plate Boots.  Wow, these would protect my feet much<br/>\nbetter when Fippy steps on them.  And they don&#39;t affect my singing or<br/>\ninstrument playing at all.  Then I put on the Platemail Helm.  It is heavy,<br/>\nbut the faceplate is open, allowing easy access for my flute and brass horn.<br/>\nI try on the rest of the pieces and they feel great.  The Breastplate flexes<br/>\nenough for me to get deep breaths needed for my songs.  The Plate Girdle<br/>\nactually has a hook for me to hang my drum on.  The leg, back and neck<br/>\npieces don&#39;t interfere with any of my abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly with the Plate Gauntlets do I see any difficulties.  I can&#39;t see how<br/>\nI&#39;d play my instruments with these guantlets on.  I thought the same about<br/>\nmy Leather gloves when I tried playing my Lute.  But with much practice, I<br/>\nwas able to manage.  Maybe I could manage to practice and learn to play with<br/>\nthese Gauntlets too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear a great laughter behind me.  Windraven is rolling on the floor.  He<br/>\nsays &quot;Silly Bard, you can&#39;t wear Plate&quot;.  &quot;Why not?&quot; I ask.............<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLuti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
