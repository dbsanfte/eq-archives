That it was<br/>\ndifficult to tell if the level 31 drop was really bigger than the level 30<br/>\ndrop since the level 30 bubbles are so much bigger than the level 31 ones.<br/>\nSince I saw a bigger drop across levels on non-hell levels (or are they<br/>\nmini-hell levels?) I wondered if it wasn&#39;t really a double dipping situation<br/>\nrather than a loss that was significantly greater one level up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 03, 2000 3:43 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question about experience penalty (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 3 Jan 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, sent that before I finished or wasn&#39;t clear or something.
