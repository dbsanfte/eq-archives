I have a PIII-450 with a <br/>\nViper 770 and 256MB of ram and I still get massive lag in caster heavy <br/>\nbattles.  The only problem with PD being off is that many songs and spells <br/>\ngive no visual clue.  Verant should make it so there is something, even a <br/>\nlittle glow.  As it is I have to pay very close attention to the text <br/>\nmessages in battle to weave well, it can get very tedious.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
