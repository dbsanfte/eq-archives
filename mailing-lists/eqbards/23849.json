Were all people in both <br/>\ngroups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is technically in our<br/>\nguild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along <br/>\nEnchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The guild leader is the<br/>\nQueen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters each. She was<br/>\nplaying the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king was playing his<br/>\nwarrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the <br/>\nguild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. Our guild is<br/>\nbased on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully only a momentary<br/>\nlapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>\nconsidered this issue.]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king wrote that<br/>\nprimaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>\nguildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of it. I guess the<br/>\nmudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a fairly small<br/>\nguild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot we&#39;ve had. I<br/>\nreally think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too insular.<br/>\nThe king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>\ninvolved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with anyone else. We<br/>\ntend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we have several dual<br/>\nguilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you might say.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had friends quit with<br/>\ndecent level characters and so we took over the account in one case and<br/>\nadded the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We have a 3rd pc in<br/>\nour office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to 3 lower level<br/>\ncharacters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We play with our<br/>\nfriends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never any issue over<br/>\nloot. We have a third generation of characters started and nearing their<br/>\n20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s given us a<br/>\nchance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>\neverything at this point. I do think there are classes and places where<br/>\nplaying 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our friends have<br/>\ngotten second accounts from friends or family members as well so now we have<br/>\nan address book of account names and passwords so we can move people and<br/>\nitems at will. Imagine the surprise of our 40s ranger friend when he logs<br/>\nback on Saturday to find he&#39;s wielding Yaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments everyone, I wanted a reality check from some 3rd<br/>\nparties and I appreciate the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana: we&#39;ve had the flu, and a 24 hr stomach bug both recently. Got to<br/>\nlove the daycare syndrome, we get every bug known to man. Fortunately my<br/>\ndaughter rarely gets sick herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Valentine&#39;s Day!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (creeping up oh so slowly on 55)<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
