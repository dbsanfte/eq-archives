I would like to address some suggestions brought up by<br/>\nKhadgarr; <br/>\n1. GIVE SOME DECENT EXP. AND LOOT FOR DOING QUESTS!!!!!!!!!! You have the<br/>\nability to reward other playstyles (i.e. Questing) SIMPLY by taking the<br/>\nalready existing quests and making them worth more exp. and loot. You could<br/>\nthen follow that up by making some more interesting quests. <br/>\nThis is a major focus of the development team at this time, loot should be<br/>\ngetting better on existing quests slowly but surely. As well as additional<br/>\nquests being implimented. The EXP rewards are being looked at as well but<br/>\nthey present a different challenge and a bit of a catch-22 which I will get<br/>\ninto below. <br/>\n2. Give a small amount of exp. every time someone successfully completes a<br/>\ntrade skill. <br/>\nThis is a possibility as well, but i would bet our definitions of &quot;small&quot;<br/>\nvary quite a bit. (see catch-22) <br/>\n3. Give exp. the first time a person steps foot in a new town/continent. <br/>\nThis, unfortunately, would require much more programming and data<br/>\nrestructuring than it would seem.. doubtful at best. <br/>\n4. Have loot spawn in a chest in a random room in an Inn every so often. <br/>\n5. Have loot spawn randomly in the forest in the middle of no where every so<br/>\noften. <br/>\n6. Have a special item hidden under a rock in the forest. <br/>\n7. Have loot spawn randomly at the bottom of a river. <br/>\nAll these are basically the same thing, spawning items in the world. We are<br/>\ndoing this to a VERY limited extent now for certain quests. Could it be used<br/>\nmore often? Sure. Will it? Most definately. <br/>\n8. Make really low level creatures spawn every so often with 4 plat on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA low level monster with higher level treasure. Does this happen now? Yes.<br/>\nCould it happen more? Yes. Will it? Yes. But once again the definition of<br/>\n&quot;more&quot; comes into question.. <br/>\n9. Make players answer riddles/puzzles for exp./loot. <br/>\nQuestions or riddles anwsered or solved are part of some current quests. Can<br/>\nthese be quests in and of themselves? For EXP reward? Under current<br/>\nconditions, no. They would be too abusable. For any kind of loot reward?<br/>\nYes. We could add riddle quests that pay out &quot;Lore Items&quot; (items which you<br/>\nhave only one of in your possession at any given time) the problem with that<br/>\nthen becomes, you have to assume that everyone knows the answer (ah.. the<br/>\nweb is a wonderfull thing) and whatever the reward is has basically become<br/>\n&quot;newbie equipment&quot; and if it is worth having, everyone in the game WILL have<br/>\nit. So will we have these types of quests for lore items? Yes. But they will<br/>\nbe fewer and farther between and the rewards probably not as great because<br/>\nthey potentially could greatly disrupt the balance of the game. Now, riddles<br/>\nas a component of bigger quests? Yes, we have more of these going in all the<br/>\ntime. <br/>\n10. Make a maze, and players who get through it get exp. <br/>\nSomething like this could be implimented with existing geometry, The Gorge<br/>\nof King Xorbb or the maze in Cazic-Thule or the Qeynos Aquaducts come to<br/>\nmind and there are quests that require you to traverse those things.. But<br/>\ncould just the act of traversing the maze gain you EXP without interacting<br/>\nwith any NPCS? No. Not at this time and I doubt that will be changing. But<br/>\ncould we have more quests that take place within and requiring you to travel<br/>\nthrough these maze like areas? Sure. And we will. Will there be more maze<br/>\nlike areas added in the future with the EQ Expansion or Paineel and The<br/>\nHole? Bet on it. <br/>\n11. The first time that a player casts a particular spell he gets exp. <br/>\nThis is something that is more complicated than it might seem and would<br/>\nrequire new data structures.. I don&#39;t think we will see this. Now, after<br/>\nsaying that.. Could we add a small EXP component to Scribing a new spell in<br/>\nyour book?? Hmmm.. <br/>\n12. Make a gambling place (or simply an NPC that plays a gambling game with<br/>\nyou for a prize). <br/>\nThere are a few quests that mimic &quot;gambling&quot; but a &quot;gambling place&quot; is<br/>\nsomething we are looking into... <br/>\n13. Reward the 1000th customer at a particular store. <br/>\nSounds simple but would require some data restructuring and addional code<br/>\nthat I dont think we will have. <br/>\n14. Make an NPC that appears randomly, gives someone an item/quest, then<br/>\ndisappears. <br/>\nThis does happen now. Could it happen more? Yes. <br/>\n15. Have bards put on plays in the town square. <br/>\nThere are NPC bards that sing in some of the taverns and such but we really<br/>\nwanted to keep this type of action to a minimium so that extended NPC &quot;spam&quot;<br/>\ndoesnt clog up an area where player driven events might be occuring. Now,<br/>\nthat being said, will we have more Dynamic GM run events like this? Yes. <br/>\n16. Give exp. to the first person who talks to a new NPC. <br/>\n(See answer to # 13 above... ) <br/>\n17. Have a drinking contest in a bar. <br/>\n18. Have an archery contest in the woods. <br/>\n19. Have a contest where the person who hits the bag the hardest gets a<br/>\nprize. <br/>\nYes. We will have (are having)things such as this in the form of Dynamic GM<br/>\ndriven events. (Also I must mention that there are many VERY good player<br/>\ndriven events happening all the time.) <br/>\n20. Randomly have the bank make a money error in your favor. <br/>\nhmm.. How about in the banks favor? I think the banks are going to be<br/>\nstaying as they are but maybe.. <br/>\nOK, now the Catch-22 I mentioned about high EXP rewards for quests and other<br/>\nnon-combat related actions. Given the current basic rules of EQ, non-combat<br/>\nEXP gains must always suppliment combat EXP and not replace it. If we were<br/>\nto allow players to advance solely by doing quests and other non-combat<br/>\nrelated actions we would generally be doing the player a diservice given the<br/>\ncurrent &quot;rules&quot; for EverQuest. In EverQuest, your character&#39;s ability to<br/>\nsurvive is based upon three things. Your Experience Level, your Skills, and<br/>\nyour Equipment/Spells. (well 4 things really, player knowledge and skill<br/>\ncount quite a bit as well) Any ONE of these things is not enough. While it<br/>\nwould be possible to gain EXP and EQ though solely questing, Skills are only<br/>\ngained by using them.. using them ALOT. A character who gained his levels<br/>\nand equipment solely through questing would always be statistically worse<br/>\nthan a character who adventured and participated in combat. Now what does<br/>\nthat matter to someone who just wants to roleplay a merchant and doesnt give<br/>\ntwo hoots about stupid stats and numbers? It doesnt. Until they want to take<br/>\npart in GM run quest through the heart of the Plane of Fear and get<br/>\nslaughtered while characters of their same level and equipped identically<br/>\nsurvive without a problem. At that point there is no going back. Anything<br/>\nthat they could possibly gain combat skills off of, due to thier level, will<br/>\nkill them in two hits. With EverQuest&#39;s current structure, there are no<br/>\navenues open for that character at that point besides being the town<br/>\ndwelling merchant. Is that bad? It would be, for someone who didnt realize<br/>\nthe choice they were making by completing all those high EXP quests and<br/>\navoiding combat on thier way to higher levels. <br/>\nNow that being said, are the current EXP rewards to low? In some cases, yes.<br/>\nAre we working to make quests more rewarding in both loot and EXP? Yes.<br/>\nIdeally quest rewards would be roughly worth the time invested. In actual<br/>\npractice this will be seen more in the quality of LOOT rewarded as opposed<br/>\nto great increases in EXP or Faction rewards. <br/>\nIs it a perfect system? Nope. But, it IS a good start for Massivly<br/>\nMultiplayer Online Role Playing Games of this scale. Just like the D&D red<br/>\nboxed Basic Set (or the three brown booklets, depending on how old school<br/>\nyou are... was a good start for pen and paper role playing. <br/>\nJust one (or two) general word(s) of advice, don&#39;t play EverQuest like a<br/>\nracing game.. sure you CAN, but it really is MUCH more fun if you slow down,<br/>\nmeet some people, roleplay and explore. Do some quests because your<br/>\ncharacter wants to help the person giving the quest, not for the reward you<br/>\nwould get for helping. Heck, try that in real life too. <br/>\nWell I have yakked on enough, thanks for taking the time to read this, hope<br/>\nit helped more than hurt.. <br/>\nBill Trost <br/>\nSenior Game Designer, EverQuest <br/>\nVerant Interactive, Inc. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Raoul de Grunt [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 02, 1999 3:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Raoul de Grunt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me the use of qeusts?
