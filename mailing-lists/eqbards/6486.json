Over the weekend I was<br/>\n&gt; playing my secondary character (a lvl 15th Necro) and had the chance to<br/>\n&gt; group with a 16th bard, it was great!  And a lot of fun. If you run in to<br/>\n&gt; Inka (the bard I grouped with) on the Karana server give him a /wave :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have to agree with Rokenn on this one... my secondary character (well, one of<br/>\nthem) is a level 26 necro, and necros love bards like nobody&#39;s business.  Aside<br/>\nfrom the usual reasons to love a bard, necros especially love them because they<br/>\nhave a line of spells Dark Pact -&gt;  Allure of Death  -&gt;  Call of Bones etc. that<br/>\nconverts health to mana.  Throw in the bard&#39;s healing songs and necros become<br/>\nunholy mana machines.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve never grouped with a necro before, give it a try, you&#39;ll be surprised<br/>\nhow effective a team it is, which is great, because before level 32, we<br/>\ngenerally don&#39;t have a lot to offer a pure spellcaster as a partner.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan Idyla and Smidge Picklefeather of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
