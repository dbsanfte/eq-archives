You will never find a high level group with a Ranger or<br/>\nDruid using chains to keep runners from taking off.  High level players know<br/>\nthe limitations of the songs and few seconds or less that chains sticks vs<br/>\nthe 2 to 3 minutes that snare sticks is practically impossible to argue<br/>\nwith.  If you are in a high level group, there is no question as to whether<br/>\nor not root goes away from the spell list or earth pets are replaced by fire<br/>\nor water when there are snarers present.  These things aren&#39;t talked of,<br/>\njust assumed.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains effect rarely lasts 3 ticks.  If you get a single resist, especially<br/>\nat higher levels, expect the MOB to start moving.  When it comes time for<br/>\nthe MOB to start running, you better not be trying to weave chains with<br/>\nanother song either.  In most high level dungeons your margin of error for a<br/>\nrunner is minimal.  A fire imp running on an efreeti raid doesn&#39;t need to go<br/>\nfar to bring h3ll down on your raiding party and even in deep paw, a gnoll<br/>\nescapes out of a room into the hallway and you are toast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your chains is in effect and snare is cast, it won&#39;t stick.  It takes a<br/>\ndruid or ranger long enough to recycle to be able to cast again that the<br/>\nlost time could mean death as well.  Worse even, I&#39;ve seen bards (including<br/>\nmyself) press the wrong key and chain a MOB that is already snared... The<br/>\neffect is to break snare and in a few seconds your MOB is suddenly on the<br/>\nloose.  Have one of these things happen once and I guarantee a good group<br/>\nwith make you stop using chains or will disband from you.  You should go<br/>\ntalk to high level rangers or druids and ask them what they hate most about<br/>\nbards... you&#39;ll find they all hate the bards that insist on chaining or are<br/>\nconvinced chains is better then snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt around level 25 is when the good bards start getting set apart from the<br/>\nbad bards and one of the traits of a bad bard is to tell other classes how<br/>\nto do their job or try to fulfill roles that are clearly already filled by<br/>\nanother class in a party.  How many bards would pixie a MOB that an<br/>\nenchanter mezzed?  I keep pixie up, but not as a replacement for mez, but<br/>\ninstead as a supplement for when it fails.  Same is true of chains.  Later<br/>\nin life you will find it is a supplement in case the snare fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains for pulling?  Depends on the situation.  There are a lot of places<br/>\nwhere it works find but there are even more places where you will end up<br/>\npulling yourself a train.  In most dungeons, the pathing is so screwed up<br/>\nthat if you don&#39;t baby-step the MOB, it will end up running through doors<br/>\nand rooms that you don&#39;t want any part of.  From my days in Sol A, we<br/>\nlearned quickly that you don&#39;t want to be SoW&#39;ed when pulling and you WANT<br/>\nthat mob stuck on your back... If it ain&#39;t there trying to stick a dagger in<br/>\nyou, chances are it has chosen some funky back-ass route that will end up<br/>\nbring half the world down on your party.  Hope you have an evac&#39;er then or<br/>\nget ready for CR.  The same is true of chains in these situations since you<br/>\nNEED that mob glued to your back.  Puller&#39;s nightmare are casters.  The damn<br/>\nmobs stop to cast on you and if you keep going chances are you aren&#39;t going<br/>\nto like the path they chose to get to you when they go to catch up.  In<br/>\norder to pull a caster correctly, you need to stop at every corner and wait<br/>\nfor the caster to catch up to you and expect to take a hit every time they<br/>\nget you in line of sight.   You want an example?  Try pulling the Bar with<br/>\nchains, or the little room next to the King&#39;s room in Sol A.   Heck, try<br/>\npulling the executioner&#39;s area in Paw with chains!  You are better off<br/>\nrunning up and smacking the mob or using a throwing dagger then you are<br/>\nusing chains.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother&#39;s character is a druid and I can&#39;t even begin to describe how<br/>\nmuch better snare/fear works then chains/fear on the big stuff.  Especially<br/>\nagainst larger MOBs where fear gets resisted.  A lot of the time fear lasts<br/>\na single pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want a group friendly slowdown?  Use binding.  And no, it doesn&#39;t wake<br/>\nup mezzed mobs.  Don&#39;t use either if you have a shaman with togors who can<br/>\nget it to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I love my bard and I love my songs, but I also know when<br/>\nto use them and when not too.  I do everything I can to learn about the<br/>\nother classes and their strengths and weaknesses so that I can make sure my<br/>\nsong line up augments a party instead of being a detriment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nOpinionated Bard of the 45th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.
