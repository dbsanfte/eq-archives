Not a problem.<br/>\nMost of their armour was tailored by me (before it was replaced by<br/>\nbetter items, looted from corpses).<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t even like to hazard a guess as to how much platinum has<br/>\nflowed back and forth, with scarcely a moment&#39;s thought.<br/>\nAnd partying with them is a pleasure.  Alpha loot?  *snort*.  Haha.<br/>\nWe trust each other enough to divide the loot evenly, once sold.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying with people you know and trust does truely make the game much<br/>\nmore enjoyable.<br/>\nI recommend that you find a group of like-minded people and enjoy the<br/>\ngame together.  Official guild or not, it adds much to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMully<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Don&#39;t take this to mean that I don&#39;t talk to strangers.  Strangers<br/>\nare frequenly welcomed into our parties, and most prove to be capable<br/>\nand competent people.  Just watch out for those that aren&#39;t!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
