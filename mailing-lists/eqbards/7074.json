I had been in South Karana<br/>\nbefore to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had never fought anything<br/>\nthere.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th level players, four of<br/>\nwhich were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>\navoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that she would sing the level<br/>\n25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and anything else appropriate.<br/>\nWe were camping at the top of the village where avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>\nand darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with this group for almost<br/>\ntwo hours.  Me and the other bard were the default tanks.  For the first<br/>\ntime in a long time, I was no longer the center of attention.  In almost<br/>\nevery fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get the aviaks initial<br/>\nattention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the aviak, they often found<br/>\nthemselves the center of attention.  I, on the other hand, almost never got<br/>\nattacked the entire night.  The most health I ever dropped to was about 50%.<br/>\nThis happened when an avocet spawned while we were in the process of<br/>\nfighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots of fun.  The lower<br/>\nlevel bard also has the luxury of not having to worry too much about getting<br/>\ncontinually whacked on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n23 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
