They are low weight, and very fast. Defintely worth<br/>\nthe money unless your heading into lower guk anytime soon and getting<br/>\nsome of the great stuff there. At 30 I wouldn&#39;t expect you to pay for<br/>\none anyway. Pick up digs and head into Cazic-thule and start hunting up<br/>\nthat rubicite. The same guy with the breastplate has the claw. I&#39;m kinda<br/>\nsurprised you haven&#39;t hunted it down yet, as on Solusek Ro I rarely see<br/>\nsomeone above 30 or so not in cazic-thule once they&#39;ve been there a few<br/>\ndays, and I kinda feel bad that I haven&#39;t gotten it once, though I have<br/>\nhunted in groups that kiled both golems, and many tae ews, considering<br/>\nI&#39;ve hunted there for quite some time now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus DuPrey<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyways, is a demon claw worth 500 pp? It&#39;s a dam 5 delay 19 weapon and comes off the Avatar of Fear in Cazic.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to shell out my entire bank just because it&#39;s the loot of a high level creature.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 30 bard<br/>\n&gt; Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
