It&#39;s true that<br/>\n  the monk could feign out of the battle to survive, but on a<br/>\n  successful feign the giant is going to utilize rapid npc non-<br/>\n  combat regen.  I don&#39;t doubt the power of any of the classes<br/>\n  I&#39;m mentioning, I&#39;m debating the con scale in that what is <br/>\n  easy for one, isn&#39;t very easy at all for another.  It&#39;s unheard<br/>\n  of for an aforementioned class to solo a giant with any success<br/>\n  based on only their skills alone.  Reward vs. Risk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  exist in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think the monk would be the worst off because while he/she would<br/>\n  take the giant&#39;s hp down rapidly, he/she couldn&#39;t absorb the extreme<br/>\n  dmg output.  Even with mend, I think a feign/mend attack would be<br/>\n  a big /yawn, and possibly impossible due to regeneration of the npc.<br/>\n  A warrior could get lucky and pull it off.  A paladin could get lucky<br/>\n  too with LoH.  A ranger could dot and snare and bow kite the thing,<br/>\n  but toe to toe the ranger doesn&#39;t have the hp/ac a warrior does.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Thus, we are illustrating the disadvantage of making level based<br/>\n  experience dependacies.  If a L30 deepwater goblin can tear me up<br/>\n  or a L31 cyclops can smoosh me, I&#39;d better be rewarded in some way.<br/>\n  Even caster npcs hit with the precision of a melee based npc and<br/>\n  on top of that they cast spells too.  If a L50 wanted to sit and<br/>\n  kill clops all day I think they should gain some fraction of<br/>\n  experience.  No other game I&#39;ve seen employs the &#39;you are too high<br/>\n  to receive exp reward&#39; from killing npcs that are lower level than<br/>\n  the player. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think part of the deeper problem in Everquest is the exp system<br/>\n  in itself.  They don&#39;t show any numbers to justify any earnings, so<br/>\n  in essence they can pull the wool over our eyes and we simply do<br/>\n  not know what is going on.  All the muds I&#39;ve played on and coded<br/>\n  on have npc level and npc experience as two completely separate<br/>\n  variables.  If I wanted to kill L1 snakes all day I&#39;d only get<br/>\n  1 or 2 xp from them every kill, if I fought a seafurry clops I&#39;d  <br/>\n  get like 1,000 xp.  The consider/level based decision on whether<br/>\n  you will earn the experience an npc gives is just not working<br/>\n  to the player&#39;s advantage.  I understand the reasons they went<br/>\n  with the existing structure, but making such a definitive line<br/>\n  where exp is cut off makes the whole system less realistic. A<br/>\n  L50 bard player should still receive combat experience from a <br/>\n  L30 monster.  A L50 druid player should not, for example.  <br/>\n  They&#39;ve made solo friendly classes, and a bard is not solo <br/>\n  friendly but rather very group dependant, which I understand.  <br/>\n  However, if I solo a cyclops that&#39;s a pretty big feat for me being <br/>\n  a bard, and I&#39;ve probably invested some time and a lot of risk.  <br/>\n  I would like some reward for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In Verant&#39;s struggle to balance the classes between each other,<br/>\n  they failed to recognize that the player classes are not balanced<br/>\n  versus npcs at all.  It&#39;s not that a warrior is too weak, or a<br/>\n  wizard is too strong, Verant simply didn&#39;t consider player and<br/>\n  npc combat.  Because PaladinA thought DruidB was too powerful<br/>\n  and gaining levels too quickly, Verant steps in.  The programmers<br/>\n  never looked at it like PaladinA versus NPC, and DruidB versus NPC.<br/>\n  Classes began to target each other in attacks, and now we&#39;ve got<br/>\n  a highly unbalanced PC/NPC exp growth system.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Everything worked in the beginning, and it was pretty.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  matter if my L50 bard can outduel a L50 warrior or L50 wizard, it&#39;s<br/>\n  just the fact that I don&#39;t stand a chance against handfuls of low lvl<br/>\n  npcs that bothers me.  My bard turned out nothing like what I <br/>\n  expected.  It&#39;s sad too.  As a class on the whole, we&#39;ve been<br/>\n  overlooked, stepped on, ignored and made promises - but in the<br/>\n  end I don&#39;t see a L50 bard as the stable and robust class I thought<br/>\n  it would be.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If I had my 4 missing songs, and if Hymm healed 30-40 hp, and if<br/>\n  charm worked up to L45 even, and if Lullaby worked liked it used<br/>\n  to, and I could load up on CHA gear / toss a flute in my hand and<br/>\n  pixie strike anything with noticable accuracy --- I would be a much<br/>\n  happier bard.  When CHA doesn&#39;t make much difference... When my flute<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t do anything noticable... When I wish I could use some of those<br/>\n  old songs that worked so well back then... I wonder what Verant&#39;s<br/>\n  vision for the class is and why anyone would want to deal with this<br/>\n  kind of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, havent played EQ in 5 days.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
