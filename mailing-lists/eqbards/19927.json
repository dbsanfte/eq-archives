Just that we got little to no<br/>\nwarning.  I found out this morning when I tried to log in to play on test<br/>\nfor a change.  It&#39;s never been my primary server (ok it was while I was<br/>\npowerlevelling myself to 50 there) so it&#39;s no big deal.  But it was my only<br/>\n50 char :(  My character on Saryrn is only 44 as of now.  It was nice to be<br/>\nable to say I had a 50.  Guess I just gotta work that much harder to get<br/>\nanother ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I going back?  Hell no.  I lost all my gear more times than I care to<br/>\nremember to corpses getting stuck in walls, in geography in gates, whatever.<br/>\nThen to get wiped with no notice because Verant f&#39;d up?  Nah, thanks I&#39;ll<br/>\nstick to a live server.  At least they back those up regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Stephen E.

Anyone playing on there agreed to that.  People are<br/>\n&gt; supposed to be there to test the new patches, zones, items . . . what<br/>\never.<br/>\n&gt;  Not to &quot;play&quot; like people on the live servers do.  Anyone on test should<br/>\n&gt; have seen that it would one day come down to a p-wipe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test<br/>\ndatabase<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; õ╗▓ÚûôÒü¿Òü»ÒüÿÒéüÒéïÒÇüõ╗▓ÚûôÒéÆÞªïÒüñÒüæÒéïÒÇÇ´¢àÒé░Òâ½Òâ╝Òâù<br/>\n&gt; ÒÇÇÒÇÇÒÇÇÒÇîÒé░Òâ½Òâ╝ÒâùÒâíÒâ╝Òâ½ÒüùÒü¥ÒüøÒéôÒüï´╝ƒÒÇì<br/>\n&gt; ÒéÁÒâ╝Òé»Òâ½Òâ╗ÕÉîþ¬ôõ╝ÜÒâ╗ÕÉîÕâÜÒâ╗ÒâôÒé©ÒâìÒé╣Òâ╗Õ«ÂµùÅÒüºÒü®ÒüåÒü×´╝ü<br/>\n&gt; ÒÇÇ<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.co.jp/info/features.html\">http://www.egroups.co.jp/info/features.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3411/13/_/451022/_/961597080/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3411/13/_/451022/_/961597080/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
