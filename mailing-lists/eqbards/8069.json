For example, the<br/>\ninfinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>\ncylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter how high), and<br/>\nbelow you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would be an equal<br/>\nradius from you in all directions.  I have always been under the impression<br/>\nthat the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also always been<br/>\nunder the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>\nseparated from you by the ground/wall but still within the radius of the<br/>\nsphere were still affected.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone confirm this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Heheh I can CONFIRM that it reaches all the way to the ground from the top<br/>\n&gt; floor of the birdhouse!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting actively pulled -<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; no problems.  If not, you get attacked by invisible birds (cuz they stand<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; ground and hit u)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One half a but to 31 woo hoo!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>\n&gt; SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended along the z-axis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
