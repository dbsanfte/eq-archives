He<br/>\n&gt; had Jboots which sucked, and exploited the fact that<br/>\n&gt; my connection was bad that evening. We started with<br/>\n&gt; the typical BBB vs. a caster, and he did get a few<br/>\n&gt; spells off on me, but not many. When we were both at<br/>\n&gt; half health I hid and healed back up to full. We<br/>\n&gt; started at it again, and that&#39;s when I learned the<br/>\n&gt; coolest mid level bard tactic against casters in the<br/>\n&gt; book. He finally got me rooted and started backing off<br/>\n&gt; for the kill. Just charm them, thy run right up next<br/>\n&gt; to you, and can&#39;t cast for the duration. All 5 times<br/>\n&gt; he was able to root me I charmed him and meleed him<br/>\n&gt; when it wore off. To mess with them even more, make<br/>\n&gt; them stand up, sit down, report your name, etc. Fun to<br/>\n&gt; the bystanders.<br/>\n<br/>\nROFL!  I have a list of Finger Wigglers as long as my &lt;insert appendage<br/>\nhere&gt; that I would love to do this to. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
