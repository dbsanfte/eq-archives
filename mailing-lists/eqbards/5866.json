I sent him a nasty gram back - tellin him he sucks for hurting a<br/>\nnewbie - albeit a ebay twinkie - and hoping the high levs on MM have a few<br/>\nwords with him.  Maybe its just a troll and I am over reacting - like always<br/>\nbut I hate to think that someone would do such a thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDear God...They are Here!!   <br/>\nby Windolas (MM)  posted 8/30/99 3:21:07 PM <br/>\n<br/>\nOk,<br/>\nWe knew they were out there. EBay be damned. WHY?!?? I flinched when I saw<br/>\nother classes sold (well, I&#39;d heard about it anyway) but last night, I saw<br/>\nwhat HAD to be a bought BARD char. <br/>\nOk...Im calming down. Here it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, on Mith Marr, I was hunting in North Karana (Im level 17 now,<br/>\nand unless I want to kite, the only way I can go solo anywhere is to kill<br/>\nBorer beetles in NK - why I didnt want to group is another story), when I<br/>\nsaw a fellow Bard appear in front of me. He was decked out in nice Steel<br/>\nArmor. He spied me playing my trusty mandolin (I was healing up) and<br/>\nproceeded to ask me a TON of newbie questions...spammed me with them in<br/>\nfact.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where am I?&quot; North Karana &quot;Where is that?&quot; hmmm..level 35...You don&#39;t know?<br/>\n&quot;What city is near by?&quot; Qeynos &quot;What race is that?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I really want to see how new he is...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the Hall of the Mountain Giants, says I..<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;WOW, Can you lead me there?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, but they don&#39;t like elves there, and I&#39;ll get killed. Giants like you<br/>\nthough, being human...just go West till you see them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is sooo cool&quot; &quot;WOW...look at that&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not go say hello? He may give you a quest...<br/>\n<br/>\n(NOTE: at this point, he is still in WALK mode)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;HEY! HELP ME!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hey...Im in a place called Freeport. Can you tell me how to get to my<br/>\nbody?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry pal, you lose everything when you die. Its a shame, but its part of<br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\n/ignore (unnamed newbie)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk. It wasn&#39;t nice. But, I wasn&#39;t in the mood to be nice. That sort of thing<br/>\nreally irks me. Just a shame to see it happening to US too. I&#39;d have thought<br/>\nbards a bit too, well, cerebral to be big buying items.<br/>\nSo....I decided to look at EBay today. After seeing this firsthand, I HAD to<br/>\nknow how bad it was. My feelings? People are lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinale note: I&#39;d do this again and again. Save all flames. I just cant<br/>\nrespect anybody who didn&#39;t at LEAST get the exp themselves. This makes the<br/>\ntwinking issue moot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Stormsong, Bard of the 17th Song, MM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
