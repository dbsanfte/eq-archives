Firstly, it isn&#39;t a<br/>\nfloating song... there is no reason why we should float. (If you were<br/>\nlevitated then it would be cool...) Secondly, it isn&#39;t like you surf all the<br/>\ntime... only when the animation runs. So it is very obvious that they just<br/>\nforgot or didn&#39;t have time to create the running and playing animation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to immerse myself in the game and really get into it... and every<br/>\ntime I see a bard running then start to play and start floating... it just<br/>\nmakes me think this is a buggy, half-finished game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait til they fix it! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
