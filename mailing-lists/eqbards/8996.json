Last night in Unrest I had a first hand experience that<br/>\nleads me to conclude Lullaby has either been secretly nerfed or<br/>\nunintentionally broken.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was grouped with a 30+ cleric and a 30+ bard.  We were camping in the<br/>\nbasement to try to get the bracelet off a greater dark bone.  We got into a<br/>\npickle and headed for the zone with a train following.  All three of us<br/>\nzoned, healed up, and zoned back into Unrest to try to get the greater dark<br/>\nbone before he returned to the basement.  We got the GDB but also pulled a<br/>\nbarbed bone skeleton.  I started to sing Lullaby so we could focus on the<br/>\nGDB and keep the barbed bone out of the fight.  All three of us were<br/>\nattacking the GDB.  When Lullaby pulsed, I always put the barbed bone to<br/>\nsleep (he never resisted).  Sometimes the GDB would resist but since we were<br/>\nattacking him it didn&#39;t make a difference.  However, the barbed bone<br/>\nskeleton kept attacking me for the entire fight.  At no time did he ever<br/>\njust stand there asleep.  Often, the attack would occur immediately after I<br/>\ngot the &quot;head nods&quot; message.  I had a similar experience with Lullaby<br/>\nearlier last week while in Cazic but last night was the first time I paid<br/>\nserious attention to it.  Because Lullaby was not properly working, I was<br/>\nforced to zone to avoid dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest everyone test Lullaby when you get the chance to confirm if you<br/>\nare experiencing the same thing I did last night.  Request that you submit a<br/>\nbug report if you have similar results.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
