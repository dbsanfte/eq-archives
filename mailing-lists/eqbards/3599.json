Since<br/>\nEQ apparently has a major problem with distinguishing vertical difference,<br/>\nany creature on the bottom of the ocean can attack you as though you were<br/>\nstanding on it&#39;s head.  Very annoying, because that means that you can&#39;t<br/>\nattack it, but it can attack you.  *ahem* Nice double standard here,<br/>\nprogrammers.  Can I report a death like that as a bug, since obviously, the<br/>\nmonsters are exploiting it...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
