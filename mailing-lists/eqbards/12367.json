It could be there are some mobs which cannot<br/>\nsee thru invis that can see you when the song pulses.  I was definitely able<br/>\nto stand right next to a mob that would normally agro and weave invis and<br/>\nhealing without activating it.  The mob I tested on was a gnoll reaver in<br/>\nEast Karana.  He was blue to me and I was right in front of him, yet he<br/>\nignored me and stayed indifferent the whole time I was weaving the two<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 10:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Dual Bard Invisibility Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read on the Bard Song Analysis page, that in a 2 bard party, you cannot<br/>\nhave one singing invisibility, and the other singing any other song (such as<br/>\nhealing, or see invis, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;[Ziann] With 2 bards in the group... if you get separated and both are<br/>\nsinging<br/>\ninvis you will go visible for a pulse when meeting up.  Also on the same<br/>\nnote<br/>\nyou can not have 2 bards singing invis at the same time as both bards will<br/>\ngo<br/>\nvisible on the song pulses.  This can be deadly when you are deep in a place<br/>\nlike Mistmoore Castle.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;[Kaearia] Any song will allow mobs to see you even if you are still<br/>\ninvisible.  e.g. If one bard is singing this song, and another is singing<br/>\nHymn,<br/>\nthe mobs can see you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my experience in a 2 bard party last night would seem to indicate<br/>\ndifferently.  We seemed to be invis, and healing at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone done any tests with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n -  Reed (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
