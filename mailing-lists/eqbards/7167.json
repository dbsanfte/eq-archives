(being that bards can out-spell<br/>\nother melee-based hybrids, and out-melee spell-based hybrids or casters [even<br/>\narmor wearing ones])<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for soloing, i have had absolutely no problem soloing up to 20. (i realize<br/>\nthat is not high level or anything, but i will get to a point i hope)  Soloing<br/>\nis all a matter of finding the right MOB for your skills. the case example for<br/>\nbards are the Beetles in North Karana for Bards.  they range in level from 11<br/>\nto 19.  At 12th Level, i was able to kite the 18th lvl ones (19th resisted too<br/>\nmuch) and could kite/melee the rest.  as the level of the mob got lower, i<br/>\ncould melee more, and kite less. This was the PERFECT spot for XP for levels<br/>\n12-20 for a bard.  Keep in mind, NO LOOT.  I do not need to find another spot,<br/>\nsince i have caught up to my friends close enough to be useful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBards CAN solo effectively, but they have to find the right mobs to hunt.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like i have been going with one hand tied behind my back or anything<br/>\n:-)  Of course, soloing is BORING and ANTISOCIAL, so i am glad that i don&#39;t<br/>\nHAVE to do it.  (but i feel that lvl 1 to lvl 20 in 6 days played is pretty<br/>\ngood for a self-styled non-powergamer (mastered Baking in that time too!))<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second point is about the no weapons as good as the Crook that aren&#39;t 30+. <br/>\nI have to disagree.  Dirk is just as good.  Barbed Leather Whip is just as<br/>\ngood.  If it is pre-dualwield then having an SBS is VERY powerful, post<br/>\ndualwield and you can use 2 very good weapons. My melee skills are much better<br/>\nat 20 (MUCH) than my friend&#39;s (lvl 20 Barbarian Shaman).  But, my Strength is<br/>\nup to 103, which probably makes a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nPost is too long already...but i ramble.<br/>\n(i don&#39;t think i ever did make a point :-( )<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid (SUGGESTIONS PLEASE!!!)<br/>\n20th Song<br/>\nWave of the Dark Tide<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
