Which really sucks, since I wasn&#39;t planning to upgrade my OS for a<br/>\nmonth or so.  It&#39;s not as if I have nothing ELSE to spend money on in DECEMBER.  Thanks for the advance<br/>\nnotice, Verant.  You&#39;d think that in a year of developing this product, they&#39;d have noticed that Win 95<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be sufficient sometime before YESTERDAY.  Idiots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis after I spent 3 days discovering that the reason I couldn&#39;t get the LAST patch to work was because<br/>\nyou needed to have Internet Explorer 5.5 loaded on your machine, as your default browser.  Nice of them to<br/>\nforget to mention THAT, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantorforjado, Virtuoso of Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
