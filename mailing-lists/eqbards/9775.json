Several of our songs<br/>\n(levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the game.  We would like to know<br/>\nwhen we can expect these to be implemented.  If they are indeed in the game<br/>\nalready perhaps discovered via quests) please at least let us know that they<br/>\nexist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to get them, or even what they are,<br/>\nbut we don&#39;t want to waste our time questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been without these songs (whatever they are) since day one of release,<br/>\nand its become a point of serious aggravation for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>\nbreak down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to be able to<br/>\nadd new abilities to Bards as the game contintued.<br/>\nlol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really have to take issue with this. It is an expansion pack. For levels<br/>\nOVER 50. Sure i may never even get to those levels..BUT they should be in<br/>\ngame now. Whats gonna happen when the expansion pack comes out? We dont get<br/>\nany new songs for over 50 cause they filled in our missing songs from below<br/>\n50? *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the excuse about the graphics patch being too big that people dont wanna<br/>\npatch it is moot now that there is the optional patch...fix our<br/>\ngraphics...hell they stopped us from surfing now when we play selo&#39;s(i<br/>\nreally liked that) so it must not be too hard to fix animations.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalaric<br/>\nTrickster Bard of the 14th song</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
