From then til 10 or noonish, you need a cleric<br/>\n&gt;or pallie to cast sense undead which will see the few that are left over -<br/>\n&gt;but beware sense undead will see all the way across the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I spent the whole night in Kithicor, sat in the burned out cabin while<br/>\nmy cleric friend ran from north karana to collect the book that spawns<br/>\nthere. In that time I saw nothing but the usual bixies and orcs on<br/>\ntracking. No undead, not even a normal ghoul. I have spoken to other<br/>\npeople on the server some of whom wanted to hunt the undead spawn in<br/>\nKithicor, and it seems that, on Rodcet Nife at least, Kithicor has<br/>\nreturned to its original pre-haloween state.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this applies to other servers or whether Rodcet<br/>\nhimself has intervened and removed the undead from the server that<br/>\nbears him name.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinani Llarieidd&#39;dra<br/>\nBard, Level 36, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
