I have never attempted to bind<br/>\noutside the city in FV as I heard it could not be done - hope my faith in<br/>\nother&#39;s info was correct.

Increase the grouping experience bonus significantly. It&#39;s currently 2%<br/>\nfor each group member other than yourself. When it&#39;s finalized and about to<br/>\ngo live, we will release the actual percentages.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2. Increase the experience modifier for underutilized Old World and Kunark<br/>\ndungeons. We will post the percentage by which these dungeons were increased<br/>\nwhen this data goes live.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3. Place more bind spots in the Old World and Kunark (we decided to try<br/>\nthis as opposed to more teleports). These will most likely be placed<br/>\nsomewhat near to dungeons we consider underutilized.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Realistically, these changes will probably go live not this patch (hey,<br/>\nit&#39;s tonight/tomorrow), but rather the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  More longer term, we are doing to randomize loot, re-path, and even<br/>\ntotally revamp some Old World dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Brad<br/>\nAll sound pretty good to me.  Perhaps increasing the xp and putting nearby<br/>\nbind spots will encourage people to hit some of those dungeons.  I doubt it<br/>\nthough as it will still be really hard to get pick up groups in them, people<br/>\nare creatures of habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we have a little pool to see who can guess the most number of new<br/>\nbind points?<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro<br/>\n49, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
