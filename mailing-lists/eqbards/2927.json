I heard it is found<br/>\n&gt; in Upper Guk, but have no idea where.  That place is huge!  Any info on<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; would be appreciated.  Also, what am I supposed to do with this stupid<br/>\n&gt; Bloodforge Hammer?  I swear, you help a dwarf out, get him his vengeance<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; the little twerp gives ya a really heavy cool magic weapon ya can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; possibly<br/>\n&gt; use.  What&#39;s up with that?  Must be some kinda dwarf joke on us poor wood<br/>\n&gt; elves.  So some info on the Orb would be great, surely someone must know<br/>\n&gt; more than I.  And, if ya got a friend looking for a big hammer on E&#39;ci,<br/>\n&gt; give<br/>\n&gt; me a tell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, July 04, 1999 9:07 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Lore stuff (OT)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as far as casters you are fighting not getting interrupted much, they<br/>\n&gt; probably have a higher channeling skill than a player caster at the same<br/>\n&gt; level, just as they can punch or slash for so much more.  channeling is<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; allows a caster to continue casting a spell even while getting hit.  plus<br/>\n&gt; the other mobs you are fighting may have a bash or stun skill that is a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; higher than a player tank at the same level (not to sure how these melee<br/>\n&gt; skills work, i just started a paladin and have never played anything other<br/>\n&gt; than bard or wizard).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t know why i answered i don&#39;t even know what i just said =P  i&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; waking up and bored to death at work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Silverleaf, Level 49 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt; Erisi, Level 6 Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Tim and Mary Steed [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, July 04, 1999 3:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Lore stuff (OT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Tim and Mary Steed&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I too would love to be able to have 2 Demon Claws <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I think it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would look cool, I am becoming more and more convinced that weapons of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; varrying speeds make little difference when combatting spellcasters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; /RANT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been hanging out in Cazic Thule for a few weeks, and we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get our fair<br/>\n&gt; &gt; share of casters there. It amazes me, day after day, how a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; low level mob (to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us) can sustain over 100 points of damage in a split second, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and STILL get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their spells off 90% of the time, while a bard is bashed for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a single point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of damage and their song ends, or a spellcaster is smacked <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for as single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point of damage and their spell is interrupted. Is this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; something Verant did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;give the monsters a chance&quot;? Kinda like how a low level <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob can smack<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you for 55 points of damage with a single swing, while we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bards probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will never be able to dish out that type of damage, even when <br/>\n&gt; &gt; our levels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approach the 40&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And does anyone know how &quot;stunning&quot; works? It seems like <br/>\n&gt; &gt; whenever I am hit,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; points, or 1 point of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; With my Stamina<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or Strength scores?
