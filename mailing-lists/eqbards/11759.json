There<br/>\nare cases where you don&#39;t WANT as much business as you have got. I know I<br/>\nhave left organizations in the past because they got Too Big. The<br/>\norganization as a whole would have done better to discourage people from<br/>\njoining so that those present could have more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not assume More always = better.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant may be interested in ending up with a solid player base of people who<br/>\nwant to play the same type of game that THEY want to put out. NOT just in<br/>\nending up with a huge player base. They very likely would be just as happy<br/>\nif many of the IDIOTS out there who don&#39;t want to play their game would just<br/>\ngo away.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve seen some of the types of questions/complaints Guides get.

We have heard snippets of &quot;we<br/>\n&gt;were shocked that players got level 50 in xx days played...&quot; makes me think<br/>\n&gt;that they (Verant) are concerned with &#39;how hard&#39; it is to make levels, etc.<br/>\n&gt;Like why have hell levels? If they want to have some kind of milestone, it<br/>\n&gt;should be a positive re-enforcement - not a negative.  If they want to<br/>\n&gt;retain players, that is. More than half of my friends who I started this<br/>\n&gt;game with have pretty much ended their EQ careers because it got to be just<br/>\n&gt;too hard (and too boring) to make progress.  In short, it was no fun any<br/>\n&gt;more.  A few others have made level 50 - the level of nothing to do. And so<br/>\n&gt;they re-start chars in other classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here are 2 scenarios:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EQ-X: hard to play.  Serious players make lev 50. It takes you 6 months of<br/>\n&gt;concentrated playing. You start a couple twinks and play them to upper 20&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;and a new game comes out somewhere else that is more fun than then next 10<br/>\n&gt;levels killing aviaks. So you semi-retire your 50 and maybe do occasional<br/>\n&gt;dragons.  But then you get sick of all the guild email about stuff<br/>\n&gt;you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;care for and you quit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EQ-Z: fun to play.  Still quite a challenge but acceptable to the<br/>\n&gt;people who<br/>\n&gt;want to play 2 or 3  hours at a session and still do pretty good.  So they<br/>\n&gt;make level 50 in 5 months.  And then start a new char of a different class<br/>\n&gt;or try a char on a Race War team or PvP server.  Things are challenging but<br/>\n&gt;still fun - not frustration.  So they get this next char to 50 in 3 months.<br/>\n&gt;And then they decide to start another char and see if they can do<br/>\n&gt;it without<br/>\n&gt;twinking and do some role playing. Now they are good for another couple<br/>\n&gt;months.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Retention rate of your customer base is gonna depend on the fun<br/>\n&gt;factor - and<br/>\n&gt;that will be the &#39;absolute&#39; of all absolutes.  This is after all the<br/>\n&gt;entertainment business.  When it&#39;s no longer entertaining, you are out of<br/>\n&gt;business.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 1:07 PM<br/>\n&gt;\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re:Re: Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n&gt;(Longish)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tThe problem with adding/removing things purely on the basis<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&quot;fun&quot; is that for the most part, it looks at only the<br/>\n&gt;relative<br/>\n&gt;\t\tside of things (will the players be happier after the change<br/>\n&gt;\t\tthan before?).
