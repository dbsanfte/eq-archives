Of course there is <br/>\nstuff that&#39;s just WAY too expensive still (just bought my barbed ringmail <br/>\ntonight woohoo).  Also, very proud that I won a whole lot of this stuff.  E <br/>\nMarr is getting to be an older server now and there are some monstrous <br/>\ntwinks running around with better gear but I&#39;m proud of what I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=360353\">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=360353</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQuick explanation too... I worked hard to get my stamina and HP up so no <br/>\nneed for invigorate and also for just plain HP sturdiness.  The crusty <br/>\npants are leftovers from that.  Also, could drop them with the addition of <br/>\na centi LS in offhand without losing the precious 100 sta level.  I swear <br/>\nhad I known, I would have put ALL points to stamina and rest to charisma <br/>\nwhen I started the character... that&#39;s another discussion tho.  I do <br/>\nappreciate the proc on the symphonic and the charisma as well... but would <br/>\ndrop it to keep the stamina and get some better dammed pants LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a list of my wish list so far... would be interested in folks&#39; <br/>\nadditions to list and prioritization of this one:<br/>\n<br/>\nEarring of solstice (for stats and FT 1 for charm kiting mana regen)<br/>\ncrystal chitin wrist(s? lore?)<br/>\nPANTS (holding out for thurg or plane but up for suggestions)<br/>\nbelt of defense<br/>\nbracer of defense<br/>\ndrums of the beast (have walrus currently)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n55th Troubador<br/>\nOfficer, Semper Questio<br/>\nE.
