Congrats. Since I started a full time job again recently I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been able to play long enough to be able to organise a party to<br/>\neven try. Also, when I do log in, seems like most of my friends are<br/>\neither playing second characters or out hunting lower level mobs to<br/>\ntwink said characters. Since the last fear plane nerfing the amount of<br/>\nthings for L50 chars to do is pretty dismal. I find this especially a<br/>\nproblem with our class. If I was a cleric I could at least wander around<br/>\nand cast heals and buffs on random newbies when I was bored, but as<br/>\npeople need to be grouped to benefit from our songs there&#39;s really not<br/>\nmuch we can do on that score.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
