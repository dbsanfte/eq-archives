Instead of boring you with a long story I&#39;ll<br/>\nmake it short.  I had a day in Ill Omen a month back when I was charming.<br/>\nAll alone in part of the zone, I had not seen another player in about an<br/>\nhour.  I was charming mobs for one on one fights.  This warrior and bard(of<br/>\nall people!) come along and start trying to kill steal.  Now they have me<br/>\ndistracted and two wandering mobs jump me.  No problem, I&#39;ll just run in<br/>\ncircles while charming.  They start disrupting the mobs that are following<br/>\nme by hitting the one my pet is on, by now I lose about 400 hp because of<br/>\nit.  While they are killing one of the mobs, some fool caster trains me<br/>\nwith 6 mobs.  I give a real life sigh and just figure if the warrior and<br/>\nbard go away I&#39;ll just have a 30 minutes challenge on my hands (sounds like<br/>\nfun!).  Nope . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the good part.  Half way through killing these I get a tell.<br/>\nWarrior: &quot;If you do that again I&#39;ll have your account banned.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>\nWarrior: &quot;You were charm kiting.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Yea, since when is that against the rules?&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who just tried to kill steal?  You know that IS<br/>\nagainst the rules, and I could petition you for it, but I am not.&quot;<br/>\nWarrior: &quot;You had about 10 mobs on you.  You are hogging all the kills.<br/>\nYou&#39;re not even getting hit.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Yea, because I was trained.  I usually only have a one on one fight<br/>\nuntil people jump in where they don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;So you are going to petition me because you&#39;re jealous?&quot;<br/>\nWarrior: &quot;It&#39;s not fair, your not getting hit, so that is exploiting.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Go ahead and petition then.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was on for probably another 4 or 5 hours that night and I never got a<br/>\ntell from a GM, I assumed they just laughed, if he petitioned at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnorance at it&#39;s finest.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:54 AM 8/27/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.

There I was, a<br/>\n&gt;lone blue-clad, green-boot-wearin&#39; bard running in big circles with 2 giants<br/>\n&gt;and an ever-increasing horde of drolvargs (mostly growlers) not far behind.<br/>\n&gt;Every now and then, one of the critters would fall over dead.  Thinking back<br/>\n&gt;on it, I have to wonder how many times I was /petitioned for exploiting<br/>\n&gt;something   heh!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=B=-<br/>\n&gt;NOR Bard Talespinner, Esq.<br/>\n&gt;Bard of 41 Seasons<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
