Even today, their goals are lofty but their ideas on how to<br/>\nimplement them are clueless.  Ie: over crowding is a problem but &quot;play nice&quot;<br/>\nis not a workable solution.  Forget about the debate whether sharing spawns<br/>\nis correct or not.  Adding something as labor intensive resolving all these<br/>\nplayer disputes to the guide/gm work load when they are currently<br/>\nunderstaffed is the joke.  Why have a policy that cant be enforced equally?<br/>\nAnd why make your already scare rescources even more burdened?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at all the stat items: str, sta, agi, dex, cha, wis, int.  I would<br/>\nguess that they intended that al lof these would be factors in the equation<br/>\nbut when they tried to put them all in, things either got way too complex<br/>\nfor them to control or the program did not run well so they took some out.<br/>\nWhy would you have meaningless stats?  Same with quests.  Good idea.  But<br/>\nwhat do we see?  A bunch of low level ones that newbies try once or twice<br/>\nthen learn from their experience that quests are not worth doing.  What<br/>\nquests are actually worth doing? Soulfire, Fiery Avenger - class specific.<br/>\nJboots - wtg verant you moved campers from one zone to another.  The cleric<br/>\nshield - class specific.  The replacement rubi armors?  These were good but<br/>\nwhere is the special bardic weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, the success of EQ will let them properly fund the dev team for<br/>\nthe Star Wars thing and hopefully they will learn from their experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, Mar 20/00, &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?
