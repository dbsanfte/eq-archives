The minute that you start","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1034023138\">Of course it happens on other servers..  and most folks will have had<br/>\nsimilar experiences with varying degrees of &quot;seriousness&quot;.  The minute that<br/>\nyou start grouping with other people there is a certain amount of trust that<br/>\nis involved.  You have to trust them to tank, heal, taunt, stun, mez, etc.,<br/>\nbut you also have to trust them to be honest with the looting.  Whenever<br/>\nyou&#39;re in a pickup group this is hightened.  No one knows one another and<br/>\nlooting could be questioned.  Personally I have done two things that make my<br/>\nlife run more smoothly in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When I&#39;m in a pickup group and we&#39;re camping a rare whatsit, I try and<br/>\ndefer looting to others, especially if there are obvious d00ds, powergames,<br/>\nor hotheads in the group.  The possibility for contention is just too high<br/>\nand I value my reputation as a fair loot distributor.  I just won&#39;t do it.<br/>\nLet the &quot;d00d&quot; loot it and say it didn&#39;t have anything - let him take the<br/>\nheat.  I don&#39;t mean this as a criticism, in fact my experience with<br/>\nincidents such as you describe brought me around to this way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I have joined a guild that is extremely trustworthy and group with them<br/>\nregularly.  When my guildmate says &quot;It didn&#39;t have anything&quot;, I believe him<br/>\nwithout question.  If he weren&#39;t trustworthy he simply wouldn&#39;t last in the<br/>\nguild for more than two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n[45 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \t\tSo my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>\n&gt; future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more<br/>\n&gt; clear rules<br/>\n&gt; set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>\n&gt; you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tAlmost as disillusioned as Harmonic,<br/>\n&gt; \t\tHalana<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSol Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
