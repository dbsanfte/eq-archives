EQ is NOT a virtual world, it&#39;s a very pretty Quake - at least<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:24 PM 8/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;SpudSucker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sprite@...\">sprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Give me a noncombatant role any day of the week.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I think overall as a class - MOST bards - at least those well suited to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;role have matured past having to be the center of attention and HERO of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Uh... In EQ there really isn&#39;t much non combat (Trade Skills), and what<br/>\n&gt;minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>\n&gt;of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>\n&gt;would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>\n&gt;NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper if<br/>\n&gt;you are successful or nothing if you fail, and then do it over and over and<br/>\n&gt;over and over again.  At least combat is a little more complex then that,<br/>\n&gt;even if a bard is a twitch character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt;have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>\n&gt;ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>\n&gt;get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>\n&gt;diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>\n&gt;get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>\n&gt;it fun to do so much!<br/>\n&gt;-Sprite<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
