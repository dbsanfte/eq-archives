Now if it allowed<br/>\n&gt; you to play<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest without owning a copy, I would understand. But I&#39;ve paid $50 for<br/>\n&gt; this game and should be free to play it wherever/whenever I wish; with my<br/>\n&gt; original CD of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you purchase software you are paying for the manual, the physical copy<br/>\nof the software and the LICENSE TO USE it.  As with most software, the owner<br/>\nof the software (you don&#39;t own it, you&#39;ve only purchased the permission of<br/>\nthe writers to use it) may put terms and conditions on the acceptable use of<br/>\nthat software.  BTW, you&#39;ll find with most software that the license<br/>\nagreement not only talks about acceptable uses of the software but also<br/>\nstates that the license is revokable, meaning should the company decide for<br/>\nwhatever reason that they would rather you not use it, they can revoke their<br/>\nlicense and make your use of the software illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, we all do own a physical copy of the game, but we only have a<br/>\nlimited license to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 28 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
