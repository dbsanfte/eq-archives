I couldn&#39;t see any evidence that lizzies are placeholders for giants.  Killing many didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; increase the spawn of giants.  The giant skels definitely are, however.  Seriously though, with me and<br/>\n&gt; that 45th level wizard working the hill (and I&#39;m pretty sure we were the only ones there) there were no<br/>\n&gt; hill giants or skeletons on that hil.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave Gaines wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say a level 45 wizard can do a good job of keeping the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; HGs cleared or not.
