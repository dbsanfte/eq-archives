In an hour we got a Crystalline blade, Zaharns<br/>\nCoronet and I kill the scryer and got an Ice crystal staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe incident that happened was when we was happily controlling the spawn in<br/>\nthe king room when two low 30&#39;s people came along, decided to run down<br/>\nthrough the doors and trained 2 Giants (we had killed the diplomat). After<br/>\nkilling both these people they came for me. I tried to make a runner but<br/>\nonly got to the flag room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so angry, these 2 idiots came along and ruined my fun, luckily a<br/>\nlevel 48 cleric was in Everfrost and agreed to res me for free (I still<br/>\ngave him a serp bracer for his kindness). I was bound in Freeport so didn&#39;t<br/>\nfancy running back to Perma from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also shows that bard song taunts have not been reduced, god knows how<br/>\nbut we was near the top of the king room and the giants killed the 2 guys<br/>\ndown near the King spawn and the giants still came for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough of my rant, I got the exp back and am now level 39. Also won roll on<br/>\nMithril Breastplate last night, on testing it I notice that when worn<br/>\ncompared to the Lambent BP it gives 8 less hp&#39;s and 2 less ac points than<br/>\nLambent but the +15 Agi is nice. I really like the look of the mithril<br/>\nwhilst in dark elf form too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 39 songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
