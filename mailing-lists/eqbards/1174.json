Without a drum,<br/>\nit does 24 damage total, and still lowers MR by 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chant of Frost and Flame are EXACTLY the same spell, but affect the<br/>\ntargets Cold and Fire resists instead of Magic. The three stack, so if you<br/>\ncycle them the damage adds up. Have to say, with 187 in percussion skill,<br/>\nthe Chant of Frost is VERY hard to sing, a constant string of missed notes.<br/>\nAll three chants are in Freeport and Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\nChorus of Cessation is a killer.  With a lute, it does 40 damage per tick,<br/>\nis an area song, and drops attack speed quite a bit.  Without a lute, it<br/>\ndoes 14 per tick.  Consider it a mix between Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and<br/>\nChords of Dissonance, on steroids. Perfect for clearing out hall trash.  One<br/>\npulse does 120 damage. Or 2000 damage per minute, if you have four targets<br/>\n(same as all the area songs, it hits four targets max).  That doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nconsider the damage your party doesn&#39;t take thanks to the very nice slowing<br/>\neffect it has on the targets as well.  That&#39;s pretty potent.  You can find<br/>\nit in Highpass.<br/>\n<br/>\nElegy is a party buff, the casters will like you a bit more.  It raises INT<br/>\nand WIS 13 points at 48th.  That one is in Erudin.<br/>\n<br/>\nRumour has it that there&#39;s at least one more 40+ song out there to be found.<br/>\nIt&#39;s more potent than Cessation, and may even make a few of the nuking<br/>\nclasses grumble.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 4:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] New songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, has anyone tried out any of the new songs and figured out what they do<br/>\n&gt;yet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I purchased the level 30 song, but haven&#39;t had the chance to investigate<br/>\n&gt;yet.  The icon is a red-background Disenchant symbol, so my first guess on<br/>\n&gt;that would be a targeted Disenchant to de-buff enemies (or maybe de-charm<br/>\n&gt;friends?).  If it can remove charm, it could be very handy against certain<br/>\n&gt;creatures.  (I just love getting beat up by my own party&#39;s Monk when<br/>\n&gt;fighting the Diviner in Cazic...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, the song is in Freeport by the way.  There are new songs in Kelethin,<br/>\n&gt;Freeport, and Erudin.  I haven&#39;t had the chance to check Qeynos or Highpass<br/>\n&gt;yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
