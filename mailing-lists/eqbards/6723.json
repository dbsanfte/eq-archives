I would love a special wind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instrument that lets charm last longer, or be more reliable,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or gets us past the L37 limit.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Getting past the l37 limit would help a lot. I think that was one of the<br/>\n&gt; more depressing things I found about high level. I didn&#39;t realise how<br/>\n&gt; much I&#39;d come to depend on charm to bail out healers and casters from<br/>\n&gt; frenzied mobs until I couldn&#39;t use it anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, from that reply from GZ posted a while back, I can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; that happening. It seems he feels that having our charm last 15 sec<br/>\n&gt; compared to whatever time an enchanter&#39;s lasts isn&#39;t enough, so he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want us to be able to charm at high levels. He said it would be<br/>\n&gt; too powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
