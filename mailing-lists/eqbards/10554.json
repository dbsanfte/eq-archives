Hey,<br/>\nif it keeps one idiot from doing this stuff, it&#39;s fine<br/>\nby me.  If you are sick of him complaining--Don&#39;t read<br/>\nhis posts.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  Yesterday, I had<br/>\nsome idiot running sand giants fairly close to me too.<br/>\n It&#39;s really quite a distraction when you are trying<br/>\nto fight something and you see a sand giant running<br/>\nstraight at you.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 23 Nov 1999 12:58:01 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Please DON&#39;T do this with your bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem<br/>\n&gt; with a member of our own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class engaging in behavior that is so intrusive of<br/>\n&gt; others? It&#39;s bad when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do something dumb and endanger myself, or my group<br/>\n&gt; - endangering bystanders<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is just unforgiveable in my book, especially when<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s unnecessary.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   You do nothing but complain on this list.
