When I right<br/>\n&gt; clicked<br/>\n&gt; on the item to activate the spell effect nothing happened. When I stopped<br/>\n&gt; playing Accelerendo and tried again, it worked fine, and I resumed playing<br/>\n&gt; Selo&#39;s without a problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later I had some cast enduring breath on me, and when I tried to resume<br/>\n&gt; levitating I encountered the same problem, but now since I could not drop<br/>\n&gt; enduring breath, I was stuck on the ground.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this a known problem with item spell effects not working when you<br/>\n&gt; already<br/>\n&gt; have spell effects active, or could it possibly point to something that<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; changed in the levitation code or general spell behaviors and may be<br/>\n&gt; showing<br/>\n&gt; up as a bug now?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any info would be helpful,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bernwyn Ablesong<br/>\n&gt; Mith Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Captrosha&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:captrosha@...\">captrosha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 7:14 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Broken Song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first allow me to introduce myself.  I am new to this list, but not a<br/>\n&gt; new<br/>\n&gt; bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a<br/>\n&gt; hurry to level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level<br/>\n&gt; 31<br/>\n&gt; song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>\n&gt; message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>\n&gt; floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>\n&gt; the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>\n&gt; cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>\n&gt; that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>\n&gt; just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>\n&gt; this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rosha Crist<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Attachments have been removed from this message]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
