He<br/>\nabsolutely refused to listen to me when I tried to tell him how to more<br/>\neffectively fight.  The fool kept trying to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, as a high level bard twice over, I feel it&#39;s my JOB to learn my<br/>\nclass better.  I&#39;ve taught some lessons on the message boards and email list<br/>\n(mostly here though) and I&#39;ve learned many lessons as well.  Bards, more<br/>\nthan ANY other class, really need to learn to play their class well.  And<br/>\nthe only way to do that is to talk to, give advice to, and listen to, other<br/>\nbards.  That&#39;s how those of us who are considered &quot;Good&quot; bards got to BE<br/>\n&quot;Good&quot; bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider myself Adequate as a bard but people in my guild who&#39;ve been<br/>\naround 90% of the bards on the server keep telling me that I&#39;m the best bard<br/>\nthey&#39;ve grouped with.  &quot;You never sing less than 3 or 4 songs, you know when<br/>\nto switch and you are always where you&#39;re needed most&quot;.  In short, I pay<br/>\nattention to what&#39;s going on.  I also never twist between fights.  They get<br/>\nmana song, or heal song.  Depending on how badly the tanks are hurt and how<br/>\nbad the casters need mana.  If it&#39;s REAL bad I&#39;ll twist but between fights<br/>\nthey like me to tell them stories ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate.  Yah the younger generation has it easier than those of us who<br/>\nare a tad long in the tooth did but there are STILL young, and old, bards<br/>\nout there who don&#39;t have the first clue how to play a bard properly.  If you<br/>\nlook around at the population in Faydwer and in Qeynos you will see dozens<br/>\nof bards below level 15<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look around the SERVER at around level 30-40 you will see far fewer<br/>\nbards.  And only about 10% of them are &quot;good&quot; at what they do.  At level 50+<br/>\nthere are far fewer bards than almost any other class.  I think Rogues have<br/>\nus beat but not by much.<br/>\n<br/>\nUhhhh where was I going with this anyway? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah!  Just because someone is an &#39;old&#39; bard really isn&#39;t an excuse not<br/>\nto know what they&#39;re doing ;)  The resources ARE available to them too ya<br/>\nknow ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nthe Babbling Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
