That&#39;s like asking a rogue not to pick pockets while<br/>\nfighting.  Taunt is very specialized to get creatures to attack them instead<br/>\nof someone else.  I&#39;ve never had to have our SK back out of a fight yet.<br/>\nHe&#39;s usually the target for the first 15-30 seconds of a fight but they<br/>\nalways switch to me soon thereafter and no amount of backing out by me has<br/>\never helped unless I do it as soon as they switch to me, which kinda defeats<br/>\nthe purpose.  We&#39;ll see how the taunting reduction affects this and how they<br/>\ndecide to implement it.  The first &#39;smart ass&#39; comment on my guild list was<br/>\nthat in order to reduce bard taunt, using Verant logic, they would probably<br/>\ngive all bard songs a refresh time of 20 seconds.  I wish I could say I was<br/>\n100% certain that the idea was ridiculous, but it sent a chill down my spine<br/>\njust to hear it suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...

Because they have limited mana, if a caster nukes in the first<br/>\n&gt;half of a fight or the second half of the fight it doesn&#39;t matter they do<br/>\n&gt;the same damage and are just as effective damage-wise either way.  They<br/>\n&gt;would be wasting mana if they nuked constantly anyhow.  If a bard doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;sing for half the fight its a huge hit to their effectiveness, since there<br/>\n&gt;is no wasting of mana to deal with.  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>\n&gt;ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>\n&gt;extra attacks for part of a fight?  Of course not.  The main reason to have<br/>\n&gt;nukers wait is because they have limited mana anyhow and they will avoid<br/>\n&gt;getting hurt and still do just as much damage by waiting.  Bards<br/>\n&gt;do not have<br/>\n&gt;this luxury.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Free shipping through 1/31/2000 at Visualize.com<br/>\n&gt;where you&#39;ll find limited edition prints & photographs<br/>\n&gt;for your home, office, collection or gift-giving needs.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFree shipping through 1/31/2000 at Visualize.com<br/>\nwhere you&#39;ll find limited edition prints & photographs<br/>\nfor your home, office, collection or gift-giving needs.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
