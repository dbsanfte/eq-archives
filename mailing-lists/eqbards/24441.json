He&#39;s<br/>\nsaid to be L55. Does he fight like VS? And since I&#39;ve personally been on no<br/>\nraids on VS, I don&#39;t know the tactics used on him either. If anyone would be<br/>\nable to sneak in some secrets on how to kill this scalekeeper, or if he does<br/>\nin fact fight like Venril Sathir, how to defeat him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd is it true that the &quot;spawned&quot; or &quot;mini&quot; Trakanon is just L55, which<br/>\ndrops only the guts for our quest? About how many would it take, and approx<br/>\nLevels to defeat him at this level?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for any information you all can provide for our fellow<br/>\nbards who read the list  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nPava Rahti &lt;Intrepid Spirits&gt;<br/>\n54 Bard on Cazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
