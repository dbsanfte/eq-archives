With no spellcasting they are as good a tank<br/>\nas a bard if not better.  Add even 18 seconds of invulnerability to that and<br/>\nthey definitely outlast us.  The cycle time is long, about 5 minutes, but<br/>\nbeing invulnerable for 18 seconds out of a 90-120 second fight effectively<br/>\nincreases their hit points by 10-15%.  Since they have as many hits if not<br/>\nmore than us already, and the same armor plus a shield...  It adds up<br/>\nquickly to their being able to absorb way more damage than us.  I have duo&#39;d<br/>\nwith my dwarf cleric friend several times and when he gets a mob&#39;s focus he<br/>\nalways ends up taking far less damage than I do, especially in the shorter<br/>\nfights.  Imagine the following, 4 wizards, 1 cleric.  Cleric casts smite,<br/>\nthen divine aura and gives the wizards 18 seconds of nuking.  In same<br/>\nsituation the bard would take a hell of a lot of damage trying to solo tank<br/>\nthe same critter the cleric could.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 11:10 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bard only equipment, a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 17 Sep 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clerics dodge skill caps at 80 so they are better tanks than us probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think ours caps at 100.

I really do think that this is a very important<br/>\noversight - all the other classes with poor defensive skills<br/>\ncan do considerable damage at a distance using<br/>\nroot/SoW/snare/pets to keep the mob away from them.  But<br/>\nbecause we&#39;re a melee hybrid, our primary means of damage<br/>\nrequires that we be in melee range.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Especially when you consider their ability to cast Divine Aura and be<br/>\n&gt; invincible for a brief time.  Sadly enough in my normal group our tanks<br/>\nare<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they can&#39;t cast spells while invulnerable, and it&#39;s<br/>\nsupposed to have a really long cycle time.  It&#39;s basically a<br/>\nlast-ditch get-out-of-death-free tactic, to help them run for<br/>\nthe zone.  Once a cleric casts Divine Aura, he is no longer a<br/>\nfactor in the fight (other than your party trying to keep him<br/>\nalive).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
