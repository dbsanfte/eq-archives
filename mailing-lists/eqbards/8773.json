Would be nice, although highly unlikely,<br/>\nif that +5 magic resist that the gypsy lute gives is given to all party<br/>\nmembers when the lute is played.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So it appears there is a Lute of the Gypsy Princess and now a Gypsy Lute.<br/>\n&gt; The screenshot of the gypsy lute says +5 Sv Magic which makes me want one<br/>\n&gt; simply for that fact.  I&#39;d be curious if anyone gets their hands on this,<br/>\n&gt; if maybe this is the equal to the Mistmoore Battle drum (I know this is<br/>\n&gt; probably just a fantasy. . . but hey, this is a fantasy game huh? =).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
