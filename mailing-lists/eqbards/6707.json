It <br/>\n&gt; requires you to give<br/>\n&gt; him a dragoon dirk. In return, he will give you the <br/>\n&gt; leatherfoot raider cap.<br/>\n&gt; According to some spoiler sites, you have to give him a polar <br/>\n&gt; bear skin/hide<br/>\n&gt; (can&#39;t remember which) first before you can do the <br/>\n&gt; leatherfoot raider cap<br/>\n&gt; quest.  I thought I had read a long time ago on this list <br/>\n&gt; that you could<br/>\n&gt; bypass the first quest and just give him the dirk from the <br/>\n&gt; outset.  I tried<br/>\n&gt; that last night and ended up losing my dragoon dirk without <br/>\n&gt; getting the cap.<br/>\n&gt; Can someone who has completed the leatherfoot raider cap <br/>\n&gt; quest tell me how<br/>\n&gt; they did it?  Also, the Marshall conned amiably to me and I <br/>\n&gt; was singing the<br/>\n&gt; carillion when I gave him the dirk.  That didn&#39;t make a difference.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was under the <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
