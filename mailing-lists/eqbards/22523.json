I twisted, lvl<br/>\n45 Jonathons, the lvl 51 Largos and lvl 47 Nivs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a purely subjective standpoint it felt like I was attacking twice as<br/>\nfast.  My only thought now is that I need to get a FBSS, hangman&#39;s noose or<br/>\nsomething, as I finally have a NEED for a haste item!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tested on a blue petrafier cockatrice wielding a Martune rapier(primary)<br/>\nand a SSOY and kicked some bardic ass!  I ended the fight a little under two<br/>\nbubbles damaged.
