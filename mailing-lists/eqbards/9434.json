Has anyone heard this also?  Does this imply that<br/>\nthere will now be an equally impressive Bard-only weapon available, or<br/>\ndo we just get hosed again?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I got roped into a GM event early this AM celebrating the opening<br/>\nof the Plane of Hate.  At some point in the late evening/early morning,<br/>\nthe event spanned from East Commons over to East Karanas.   Pretty fun.<br/>\nI got to loot a nice no-drop Bard-usable weapon when a level 50 Ranger<br/>\nin my guild killed one of the event spawn:<br/>\n<br/>\nTainted Tier&#39;Dal Rapier  Magic  19 delay  5 damage  +2 dex  +5 agi  -5<br/>\nsave disease  no-drop  and (i think) weight 4.5  Pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately after picking this up, I was running back to the High Keep<br/>\npass entrance from the woods and figured I&#39;d take a whack at the<br/>\nsolitary MOB in front of me and tow him back to the crowd of seventy at<br/>\nthe pass.  Killed me with three spells.  Gack.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 31 (almost 32) songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
