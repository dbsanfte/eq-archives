Sound advice truly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say though that getting Lysera&#39;s Locating song as soon as you can is<br/>\na good thing.  And Selos and a drum - these have been my mainstay for many<br/>\nlevels.  You can make lots of friends helping them find their temporarily<br/>\nmis-located corpses - and even in a nice zone like misty - they can be very<br/>\npaniced at the loss and you will be a great hero and friend for life!  Never<br/>\ncharge for this duty - is my rule - donations can be accepted of course but<br/>\nif you put a price on this service you may get asked to go to places that<br/>\nyou will wish you have never seen - eg: Runnyeye & Gorge of King Xorbb and<br/>\nfeel obligated to accept.<br/>\n  <br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 13th level<br/>\na.k.a.

I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>\n\t\tQuellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>\n\t\textreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>\n\t\tdesert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>\n\t\tas of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>\n\t\tintend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>\n\t\twanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>\n\t\tmy profession? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>\n\t\treading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>\n\t\tabout here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMost of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>\n\t\t&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>\n\t\tall of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>\n\t\tof the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>\n\t\taffecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>\n\t\twould be well appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks in advance,<br/>\n\t\tWynsong<br/>\n\t\tWood Elf Bard, Level 3<br/>\n\t\tRivervale, Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--<br/>\n\t\t~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just <br/>\n\t\tthat ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n\t\tICQ#1976509<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tAre you?
