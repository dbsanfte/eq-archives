This topic has been discussed on many occasions on<br/>\nthis list.  As far as I know, no one has been able to determine if AC is the<br/>\nonly factor in determining how much damage you receive per hit or if armor<br/>\ntype plays a role (i.e. deflects part of the blow).  Guess the best way to<br/>\ntest it is to find a monk with the same AC as you and start collecting data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This may have already been touched upon, but I&#39;ll say this: I was in full <br/>\n&gt; steel plate by 26th level (well the visual pieces anyways). The AC <br/>\n&gt; difference is not much, but that is only half the reason for the upgrade, <br/>\n&gt; bro. Not only will you have a slightly higher AC than you will with<br/>\n&gt; Banded, <br/>\n&gt; but PLATE ARMOR inherently absorbs damage better than lower forms of<br/>\n&gt; armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Compare a monk in whatever armor he is wearing (doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; raw-hide or full shiverback &quot;armor&quot; or whatever the planes armor is <br/>\n&gt; nowadays) against any plate-wearing melee class when getting hit by a <br/>\n&gt; monster. WHEN HIT by the mob, a monk will almost always take more damage<br/>\n&gt; per <br/>\n&gt; blow than a plate-wearing person, because of the class of armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
