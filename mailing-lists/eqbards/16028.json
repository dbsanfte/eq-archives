Heh, I have not played<br/>\n&gt; mine since reaching level 32 &lt;g&gt; well, ok, I do play it some when the tanks<br/>\n&gt; are swinging the heavy weps in long fights.

Don&#39;t melee<br/>\n&gt; below full hp or step out before getting under half health.  At least on<br/>\n&gt; these uber-mobs.

I bagged my<br/>\n&gt; Yk thinking that a) level difference what it is 47 vs 60 no matter what wep<br/>\n&gt; I use, it wont hit for full effect; b) the Yk 75dd proc gets resisted all<br/>\n&gt; the time but adds you to the hate list as if it hit for full effect.

I spent a lot of time playing around with the<br/>\nlevel 48 song and trying an all-instrument attack on various<br/>\nmobs solo.  So I&#39;m a bubble and half into 49.  Rokenn seems to<br/>\nhave stalled like you did - he used to be ahead of me, but<br/>\nhe&#39;s still 47.  Once you get 48 back, you *have* to try<br/>\nsoloing or grouping with one tank and using nothing but your<br/>\nlute.  Both of you should do even better since you have<br/>\n7-string lutes.  20% bonus to heals + 20% bonus to DoTs = 44%<br/>\nincrease in effectiveness over my lute.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
