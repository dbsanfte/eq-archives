What happens when you&#39;re at a<br/>\ncamp when certain people in the group can&#39;t win anything?  I like it when a<br/>\ngroup is doing &quot;use based&quot; loot, but often its not fair to all people.<br/>\nGrouping with guild/friends is totally different.  If an item drops which<br/>\nwould be used by someone in the group, and its randomed, you need to find<br/>\nsome better friends (or a better guild).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a zone where spells drops, its pretty standard for the player to get any<br/>\nof their class spells that drop.  The problem is mellee got hurt in these<br/>\nsituations.  A great solution is to have all the mellee choose a class<br/>\n(which isnt in the group) and they get that class&#39;s spells.  Any un<br/>\nrepresented class spells get randomed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
