Players of level 53 or above will now <br/>\n&gt; &gt; encounter <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their <br/>\n&gt; &gt; chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced <br/>\n&gt; &gt; out by much <br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Antonica to the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
