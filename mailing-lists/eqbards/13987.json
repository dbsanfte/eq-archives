It takes all those level<br/>\n50&#39;s who would be camping the EXG for a charred guardian shield and moves<br/>\nthem into Lower Guk or Sol B and has them camping YK&#39;s, Mithril 2-handers<br/>\nand such.  We already know that a lot of the reason those level 50s are<br/>\nfarming the level 20&#39;s dungeons is because they are bored and there is no<br/>\nroom for them in the higher level dungeons.  So you may help with the lower<br/>\nlevel crowding a tad until all those 50&#39;s with absolutely nothing to do<br/>\ncreate new characters and then they take them into the level 20 dungeons.<br/>\nGod knows it won&#39;t take a level 50 long to get a level 25+ up and running...<br/>\nthey had enough time to get a level 50 already for gods sake :P.  So in the<br/>\nend, you end up making the higher level dungeons more crowded and the lower<br/>\nlevel dungeons more crowded...  Of course, if this is combined with some<br/>\nother solutions to eliminate camping and over crowding we may have a plan.<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t see any way to fix a darn thing though without tripling<br/>\nthe size of the world (including adding a lot of new or duplicated dungeons)<br/>\nor tripling the number of servers, neither of which I think has a shot of<br/>\nhappening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 28, 2000 1:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Alternate overcrowding solution<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As several people have noted, one cause of overcrowding is a higher level<br/>\n&gt; character soloing in a spot designed for a group of lower level<br/>\ncharacters.<br/>\n&gt; One level 50 camping Item X takes a potential spawn area from a group of<br/>\n&gt; level 20&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Potential solution:  Magical items don&#39;t drop if the character doesn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; any experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; + reduces farming<br/>\n&gt; + reduces twinking<br/>\n&gt; + frees up spawns for appropriate level groups<br/>\n&gt; - forces you to get an item before you gain a certain level<br/>\n&gt; - forces you to trade for an item you can&#39;t get yourself<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
