If you are consistently grouped<br/>\n&gt;with players, it benefits the group (or guild) to ensure that everyone is as<br/>\n&gt;well equipped as possible.  But in pick-up groups, or if you have &quot;guests&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(non-guild or non-reg group), then I think (imho) that everyone deserves the<br/>\n&gt;right to roll for any loot. It is their compensation for the risk of being<br/>\n&gt;in the group.  Now you can modify that rule to everyone can pick any item<br/>\n&gt;they want to roll for and once they win a roll they are out of the rolling<br/>\n&gt;until everyone has an item.  This allows some choice and you avoid winning<br/>\n&gt;something you don&#39;t want. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
