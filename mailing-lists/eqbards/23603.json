I can usually keep 3 targets mezzed (barring resists) quite<br/>\ncomfortably, but that effectively removes me from combat completely - I<br/>\ncan&#39;t melee or twist other songs, since once I&#39;ve re-mezzed one target, I&#39;m<br/>\nstraight onto the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason I keep it memmed is because it&#39;s just so darn handy to<br/>\ninterrupt casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had *the* closest escape in the Dreadlands the other night.  I was intent<br/>\non making 46 and decided to solo for a while since group exp in DL is<br/>\ncomparatively slow.  I was chain-charming things and my last thrall was a<br/>\nSoW&#39;d Drachnid Widow which was at half health from it&#39;s last fight.  I<br/>\npulled it to the Karnors east wall and weaved my way through the pillars,<br/>\nchanting, chaining and Selo&#39;s-ing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got a few big double hits on me which made me wince, but I thought I<br/>\ncould handle it.  Then, horror of all horrors, she rooted me and moved in<br/>\nfor the kill.  At first I tried to charm her, but she kept stunning me.  All<br/>\nof a sudden I&#39;m down to less than a bubble of health and the realisation<br/>\nthat my last couple of hours work was all for nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave up on charm and started mashing Pixie Strike.  It landed.  I quickly<br/>\nswapped my tambourine for lute and twisted in Hymn.  Another burst of Pixie<br/>\nStrike and she remained mesmerised.  I kept this going for 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>\nPixie Strike until the roots fell from my feet and I thought &quot;screw this&quot;<br/>\nand made for the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s a /rude to the 49 SK from Prophecy who stood by and watched the<br/>\nwhole time. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nI swear, when I zoned into FV, my hands were clammy and shaking.  It&#39;s just<br/>\na game, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie Strike is one song I&#39;ll never do without - Enchanter or no.  I can&#39;t<br/>\nwait until 53 for Song of Twilight.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
