Therefore, the less you know, the<br/>\nmore money you make.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>\ncorner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>\npredictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>\nthe same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>\nonly things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>\nand exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>\nvirtually impossible to make things challenging - once you <br/>\nfigure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>\nchallenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
