The bard song only affects party members within a certain<br/>\nrange of the bard.   We&#39;ve all experienced the case where a party member<br/>\ngets out of range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando and then falls behind the party.<br/>\nImagine the same thing happening 100 feet underwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all complicated by the fact that it&#39;s very hard to see underwater,<br/>\nand it&#39;s easy to get separated.  Also, people are swimmers of vastly<br/>\ndiffering skills.  My swimming is maxed out from being in the OOT for so<br/>\nlong.  Other people my level often have swimming skills of 5-10.  Comparing<br/>\nmy swim speed to theirs is like comparing a jet ski to a flutterboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song is great for a bard solo though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
