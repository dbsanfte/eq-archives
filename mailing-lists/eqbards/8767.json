I find that I still like the secure feeling of my heavy, slow mino axe for big stuff. I&#39;m planning to put the dirk in my off hand when I hit 17 and want something magical for the primary. The barbed leather whip seems to have good stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) How much should I auction for it and where? (I know it comes out of Najena)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Is it better bang for the buck than a combine ls or scim?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\n<br/>\nMeandering Maestro of the 15th Song<br/>\n<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
