I&#39;ve<br/>\ndied numerous times accidentally hitting F9 instead of F8 and then trying<br/>\ndesperately to F9 to the correct view, ehhe... One time trying to run out of<br/>\nthe Archon area thru the temple.  I invised myself so I didn&#39;t immediately<br/>\nattract unwanted attention with the mobs on the corners and in the maze...<br/>\nbut got caught in a corner and couldn&#39;t tell which view I was in... (Didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave see invis.. hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have hotkey banks set up for both inventory and songs.  I have Bank 5<br/>\nset up for &quot;All Songs&quot;.. Keys 1-4 are songs and 5 and 6 is Melee Weapon 2<br/>\nand and inventory slot.  I use my left hand to switch songs and my right<br/>\nhand to switch instruments with the mouse.  My desk is crowded (2 puters set<br/>\nup on a single puter desk, my gf plays along side me) so my mouse is up by<br/>\nthe monitor, not on the side of my keyboard which would be preferable.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what makes it hard to both move my character AND switch instruments<br/>\nat the same time.  I hope I&#39;m not missing something and there is an easier<br/>\nway to switch instruments (other than usuing mouse control for my character,<br/>\nI can never get used to that.  I use keyboard controls even in Wing<br/>\nCommander :)  I&#39;m switching to a trackball that will fit alongside my<br/>\nkeyboard, so hopefully I can get more proficient with moving back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, all my hotkey banks are full, but I have a hard time swapping things<br/>\nout... in an emergency, I need to have keystrokes very familiar (Shift 2, 4<br/>\nfor Selo&#39;s - Shift 5,1,F8,2 for Charm/Target/Pet Attack) otherwise I feel<br/>\nI&#39;m behind the 8-ball.  I&#39;ve heard said on this list and I completely agree<br/>\nthat in a NON-twitch game, the Bard is definately a twitch character.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
