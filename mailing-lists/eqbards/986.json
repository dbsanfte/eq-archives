I TOTALLY agree with anyone who has<br/>\nsaid that the songs are just not what they could be. I understand that its<br/>\nnot an east thing to do to create some kick ass songs, but I am very upset<br/>\nwith Verant on this part. I am currently a 15th level Bard, and that is a<br/>\npretty good level for most classes. We should have a total of 15 songs at<br/>\nthis time to use, which is a pretty good selection, but like everyone else,<br/>\nI find myself just using 4 or 5 songs all the time, because they are the<br/>\nonly usefull ones. Any other magic class usually has a variety of usefull<br/>\nspells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same 4 or 5 spell over<br/>\nand over again. They switch them around considering what the situation calls<br/>\nfor<br/>\nI know we get some kick ass songs later on in levels, but should I bust my<br/>\nhump just to get to say, 32nd level so I can be a mana bard?<br/>\nI know theres some more songs in there, but say at 32 level, the most songs<br/>\nI can see being usefull are maybe 10. Which still leaves another useless 20<br/>\nsongs....I dont know...I think I am just gonna take a break and see where<br/>\nthey go with the bard, but for now, Rolande is on a vaction on Marr Island,<br/>\nwith all the &quot;Sisters of Love&quot; = )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
