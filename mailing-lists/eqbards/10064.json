I<br/>\n&gt; have NEVER bought food for myself. I occasionally have to buy milk,<br/>\n&gt; (although not for the past 10 levels).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;grapes&quot; you forage that do not stack are actually 2 different<br/>\n&gt; items, Berries, and Fruit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When foraging i usually arrage my food items so that whatever i have the<br/>\n&gt; most of gets eaten last. This is useful for saving on weight, i carry 20<br/>\n&gt; of one item, less weight than carrying 5 of 4 items. Also is good when i<br/>\n&gt; actually find someone who needs food (just foraging I usually have 60<br/>\n&gt; food or more at all times) i can give it to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, you know that message &quot;you cannot try to forage while attacking&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; well, you CAN try, you just can&#39;t succeed. I have forage hotkeyed on my<br/>\n&gt; main combat hotkeys. Occasionally i have hit it during combat<br/>\n&gt; accidently. One time when i did this i got the above message and then i<br/>\n&gt; got &quot;you have increased your skill in Forage (43)&quot;. This was with my<br/>\n&gt; druid, since my bard has been maxed in forage since he got it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt; 29th Bard Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 16<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Fri, 12 Nov 1999 17:34:24 PST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Tom Henschel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tomhenschel@...\">tomhenschel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Poor Foraging<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have forage maxed, and hardly ever succesfully forage.  It leveled so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slowly that i put about 20 practice points into it (I still have about<br/>\n30<br/>\n&gt; &gt; points).  I get water so seldom that i always buy milk.  I usually get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grapes, and they don&#39;t always stack together.
