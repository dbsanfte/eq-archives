I tried Unrest at 18 and 19 and got into some of the worst groups I<br/>\nhave ever seen.  The groups were far more horrifying than the mobs.  Get<br/>\nthis, one group I was in, the cleric had the following spells memm&#39;d at<br/>\nlevel 17.  Summon food, Summon drink, Hammer of Wrath, Smite, Furor, Light<br/>\nHeal! and that&#39;s it!  I know from the screenshot he emailed me of his<br/>\n&quot;awesome kill of a horrid undead via his amazing Smite spell&quot;  I get the<br/>\nshivers every time I think of Unrest now, not from the mobs, just from the<br/>\npathetic groups I was in there.  Verrrry  scary.  The close, but still<br/>\nsecond worst, was the 19th level magician who insisted on tanking right up<br/>\nthere with his pet and pulling &quot;cause he was the highest level and would get<br/>\nless trash&quot;  I have never seen more bodies, nor greater reason for there to<br/>\nbe bodies in any zone I&#39;ve been too except for the one time during the great<br/>\nSquad Ring Massacre in Rivervale square.
