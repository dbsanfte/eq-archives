The guide listed<br/>\nas one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>\ngroup skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>\nbefore with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>\nlevel 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of rogues<br/>\naround, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>\nthe Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>\nisn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nDilvish<br/>\nBard of 20 songs<br/>\nPovar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
