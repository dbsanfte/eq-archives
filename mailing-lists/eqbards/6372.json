What happens if your One chance at looting the mob comes up empty?  You are then forced to buy or trade for the item?  I like the concept but would hate","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1041564532\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;When the player-to-player trade (or twink) aspect of an RPG<br/>\n&gt;starts to interfere with the adventuring aspect, something is<br/>\n&gt;wrong.  After playing this game, I&#39;ve decided a &quot;shows up only<br/>\n&gt;a few times a day&quot; system is really stupid when a mob that&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;challenge to you is a pushover for someone else, and there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;no system to enforce taking turns.  I think a better system<br/>\n&gt;would be to allow each character to loot each special mob once<br/>\n&gt;in a lifetime, and put lower level looting limits on the mobs<br/>\n&gt;(to prevent the use of mules).  No more kill stealing for nice<br/>\n&gt;items, no more harvesting to trade/sell on EBay/twink, no more<br/>\n&gt;camping the same place for a week (and blocking out others) so<br/>\n&gt;your entire guild can be outfitted with the rare item, and no<br/>\n&gt;more having to wait 3 days for a rare mob to show up.  The<br/>\n&gt;&quot;rare&quot; mob could always be there, and rarity of an item could<br/>\n&gt;be determined by how frequently he drops the booby prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What happens if your &quot;One&quot; chance at looting the mob comes up empty?  You<br/>\nare then forced to buy or trade for the item?  I like the concept but would<br/>\nhate to get unlucky and be stuck... maybe change it to having One chance to<br/>\nloot the item?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Believe me, as you get some of the nice continuous effect<br/>\n&gt;songs like invisibility or levitation, you will wish you had a<br/>\n&gt;pair of jboots.  My friends have started poking fun at me<br/>\n&gt;because I&#39;ve been asking for SoW a lot lately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always ask for SoW when anyone in my party is SoWed, because I have a hard<br/>\ntime &quot;saving&quot; the party with selo&#39;s when things get rough... Everyone<br/>\nscatters in different directions and I (who should have one of the best<br/>\nchances of escaping) die because I&#39;m the only one not running.  And I&#39;m<br/>\ntired of killing people&#39;s SoW with Selo&#39;s.  JBoots would be great...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
