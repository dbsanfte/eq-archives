Put the location to buy song as a key on the main list eg: Q,K or E or<br/>\nHK.  I keep a chart like the main one handy for the frequent tells:<br/>\n<br/>\nyungbard: excuse me m&#39;lady can you tell me where to buy my 14th song?<br/>\n<br/>\nsylly: sure but first just call me sylly!  <br/>\n<br/>\nlooks on handy dandy chart<br/>\n<br/>\nsylly: ahh yes you can get Lyssa&#39;s Libbertto in Erudin - look for the round<br/>\nbuilding kinda in center of town or ask someone to take you to the library -<br/>\nthere is no name on the building<br/>\n<br/>\nfeels like she impressed someone<br/>\n<br/>\nyungbard: ahh thank you m&#39;lady <br/>\n<br/>\n2. It&#39;s prolly just me but I dont care for dark backgrounds. Ok, that one<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t count.  It printed quite well for a web page - did you do something<br/>\nspecial to make page break correctly?  If you have page controls for<br/>\nprinting, I would suggest having fewer songs on the first page and making<br/>\nthe abbreviation key a &quot;footer&quot; so it repeats on both pages.  I keep my<br/>\nsheet in a plastic cover right next to my keyboard and refer to it alot.<br/>\nHaving the key on both sides would be handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all - it looks really great!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch Rokenn!!! (and John too as i imagine this is part of your<br/>\njoint effort? or is his ananysis coming later?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 10, 1999 10:56 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQBards@onelist.com\">EQBards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Grand Opening!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken the feedback from this list and the Concert Hall message board <br/>\nand put together a website with your collected wisdom.
