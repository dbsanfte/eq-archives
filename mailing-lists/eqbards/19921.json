GK&#39;s in Solb?) started dropping<br/>\n  Naggy/Vox loots - heh!<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>\n  over<br/>\n  &gt; the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>\n  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  &gt; heard.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>\n  &gt; on:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; 1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heard that they tried a load from tape and it brought back all the GM Buffed<br/>\n  & Itemized Level 60 chars from the Kunark beta as well. (more on that<br/>\n  below.)  It restored every character recently created not just current<br/>\n  characters or something like that.  On live servers they are able to restore<br/>\n  chars from tapes they keep.  Not sure of the current cycle but about 6<br/>\n  months ago a friend got restored but the save point was from a few days<br/>\n  previous.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>\n  &gt; stinks nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It stinks - big time!  Think about this happening on a live server or on all<br/>\n  live servers. I guess that is why they have a test server but it also points<br/>\n  out (yet again) the woefull lack of professionalism in Verant&#39;s procedures.<br/>\n  Are they no more than a bunch of &quot;Cowboy Coders&quot; ??? They can&#39;t even do<br/>\n  reliable tape back-ups??? Here is a valuable resource - test server and the<br/>\n  testers.  The design of the game is such that you need to invest large<br/>\n  amounts of time to get to high levels. To go for a year and allow folks to<br/>\n  build their chars and test the new things without adequate protection is<br/>\n  simply gross negligence.  To say &quot;its just a test environment and you knew<br/>\n  that you could be pwiped at any given time without notice...&quot; is just<br/>\n  legalise B.S. to cover their ass for their own incompetance.  I can see that<br/>\n  level of  error allowable on in-house, alpha level environment or even<br/>\n  closed beta.  To have run the closed beta on the test server - was a huge<br/>\n  error on their part (thank you 20-20 hind site) but it smacks of their<br/>\n  &quot;penny-wise, pound-foolish&quot; attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the test server and the testers there are truly valuable resources, then<br/>\n  they should have had adequate safeguards in place to allow them to recover<br/>\n  their test world to a previous save point.  This really hurts they<br/>\n  credibility and shows what little respect they have for testers who are<br/>\n  helping them.  Imagine how they regard the ones who merely play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sylly<br/>\n<br/>\n  p.s. I heard that in the beta GM&#39;s would &quot;buff&quot; their friends (testers) -<br/>\n  make them level 60, give them any weps, any armor, and then they would try<br/>\n  stuff.  I heard that folks saw these guys in this uber-garb but with weps<br/>\n  equipped in the wrong hands and stuff.  When they (GM twinkies) tried to<br/>\n  fight mobs, they got owned.  But not cuz of their gear that was for sure.<br/>\n  They just did not know what they were doing: ie &quot;could not fight their way<br/>\n  out of a paper bag, much less clear the way to Trak&#39;s lair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  But that is merely rumors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
