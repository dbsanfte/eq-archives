Kael armor has <br/>\nhigher AC, Skyshrine has higher stat values (including resists).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be eventually angling after Skyshrine Armor for a couple <br/>\nreasons.  Many guilds have already gone after Kael armor, so they&#39;ll <br/>\nbe less competition for Skyshrine (I hope) and at the super high AC <br/>\nthese armor already have, if I lose 2 or 3 ac per piece but gain <br/>\nacross the board in resists, I think I&#39;ll be better off overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, it appears the Caster armor is better out of Skyshrine than <br/>\nKael, and my GF plays a mage.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it not true that all the velious armor has basically the same <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stats but are arrived at through different avenues depending on what <br/>\nfactions you want to destroy?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; i.e. Melodic = Resonant = Troubador ?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -Faras </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
