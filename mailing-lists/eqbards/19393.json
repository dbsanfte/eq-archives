The MoTD also said<br/>\n&gt; that we should go to<br/>\n&gt; everquest.com<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)</a><br/>\n&gt; and get<br/>\n&gt; the details on the event, so I went.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an<br/>\n&gt; archery contest. It looks<br/>\n&gt; fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because,<br/>\n&gt; despite the discover of a<br/>\n&gt; bard usable bow, there are no arrows we can use. So<br/>\n&gt; I was poking around on<br/>\n&gt; the same events page to see what else was up and<br/>\n&gt; comming that I could<br/>\n&gt; participate in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Test of Steel... Nope.<br/>\n&gt; Warrior, Monk, Paladin, Ranger and Shadow Knights<br/>\n&gt; are the only ones who can<br/>\n&gt; enter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Test of Mystics...

Nope.<br/>\n&gt; Clerics, Paladins, Druids and Shamen only.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So basically, I found out that there is an event for<br/>\n&gt; every single class,<br/>\n&gt; except for bards. I was a little disappointed that I<br/>\n&gt; am unable to compete in<br/>\n&gt; any of these events merely because Verant has no<br/>\n&gt; idea where bards belong in<br/>\n&gt; the grand scheme of things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was gonna post all of this to the EQ message<br/>\n&gt; boards, but I wanted to see<br/>\n&gt; if you guys had any input first. I&#39;m generally<br/>\n&gt; opposed to whiny posts, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure that regardless of how I word my<br/>\n&gt; disatisfaction, that is how it<br/>\n&gt; will be construed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the Tribunal<br/>\n&gt; [2 levels to planar capability]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
