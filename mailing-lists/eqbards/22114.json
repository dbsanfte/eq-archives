Then RL issues kept him from attending.<br/>\nThe backup raid leader (Kittie) and the monk puller were also no-shows, so<br/>\nmany people began to think that the raid wouldn&#39;t happen, but someone else<br/>\ntook over and led it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up with a group of guildmates; 3 shaman (shamen?  shamans?<br/>\nshapersons?), a warrior, a cleric, and myself.  Only one other bard<br/>\n(Fantacy, who was really nice... hehe) was in attendance.  We agreed that<br/>\nif<br/>\nany bard items drop and she doesn&#39;t have it (she only needed BP, legs,<br/>\nboots, and gloves I think) she would get it, otherwise it&#39;s mine.  However,<br/>\nshe warned, the past 5 Hate raids she went on, no bard items dropped.  I<br/>\ntold her maybe I&#39;ll have beginner&#39;s luck.  Boy did I ever...  =8^)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow, my group managed to get exp (even though I died 4-5 times, I still<br/>\nended up with more exp then when I started).  As a matter of fact, I dinged<br/>\n47 on the very last (or maybe next to last) mob pulled for the night!<br/>\n<br/>\nDrops were incredible.  Everyone in my group got at least one item, some<br/>\ngot<br/>\nmore.  Every class had at least one item drop (I think).  The shammies were<br/>\nthrilled with an incredible 5-6 drops.  Clerics went nuts, with some<br/>\nactually getting 2 pieces, which from my understanding, is unheard of.  A<br/>\ncouple mage items dropped, and a couple rogue items dropped.  Warriors were<br/>\ndissapointed as no warrior items dropped until the end (I&#39;ll get to that).<br/>\nI made out like a bandit...  hehe  I got arms, helm, and Evensong!  Fantacy<br/>\ngot gloves.  Warriors finally were tossed a bone at the end when the<br/>\nMaestro<br/>\ndropped the warrior epic quest item (some hand thing).  The warrior in my<br/>\ngroup, Esop, won that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything went really well with only one snag; when moving from the wall<br/>\ncamp to D (which is Maestro&#39;s building) we somehow pulled a nasty train and<br/>\nalmost everyone was killed.  Some clerics were able to camp out however, so<br/>\nwe were back up and pulling in no time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Hate!  =8^)<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 47 Missed Notes (working as intended)<br/>\nCrimson Legacy<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
