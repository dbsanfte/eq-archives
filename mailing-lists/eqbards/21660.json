Mind you i still can<br/>\n&gt;drop 3-4 of them before they pull their second one.  Another thing that is<br/>\n&gt;great about them is they max lev at 37, which is same as our low lev charm<br/>\n&gt;song so no need for mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, thanks for the suggestions to go kill the giants, and also thanks<br/>\n&gt;for the suggestion on buying rubies with the cash and reselling afterwards<br/>\n&gt;at a loss of about 10-12pp per gem (big deal).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Minkin<br/>\n&gt;lev 40 and climbing<br/>\n&gt;Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S.

I am in the same boat as you. I usually can only <br/>\nplay for 1.5 to 3 hours tops and it&#39;s hard to find a group, get together, <br/>\nfind a hunting spot and hunt before I have to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 40 as well and find the giant hunting a very nice alternative (I <br/>\nhave yet to get a forest loop from these stingy buggers), and the money is <br/>\npretty decent from all the tunics and various weaps I get off of &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it can get to be a bit tedious after a while, so I&#39;ve journied to <br/>\nCity of Mist and am still getting pretty good experience as these groups <br/>\nlove having a bard. Not a great place during off hours, but I&#39;m going to <br/>\nexplore the emerald jungle area and see if I can charm/kite around there. <br/>\nThe trees will make it difficult, but I&#39;ll see if I can find a clearing <br/>\nsomewhere as I like to use 3rd person perspective when charming.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I&#39;m on Bertoxxulous so CoM hunters may be different, but there usually <br/>\nis only 1 or 2 groups hunting here, and it was fun to use my lament and <br/>\npull for the group, and charming the extra if we get 2 of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, at my current level I find that in a group during combat I&#39;m <br/>\neither weaving Celerity and Arms with either mana/hymn (for groups with <br/>\nmore tanks than casters, also improves my melee skills which have waned due <br/>\nto all my charm/kiting)or using my 2 chants (w/tambourine) with mana or <br/>\nhymn. Kind of curious about what other bards like to weave in a group at <br/>\nlevel 40. I agree with previous bards that throwing in manasong during <br/>\ncombat is more of a gesture than it is effective, but I refuse to just sing <br/>\nmanasong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\nClan Battlehammer<br/>\nBalladeer of the 40th song<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
