I&#39;ve been grouped<br/>\nwith rangers a lot recently using snare/fear in the Overthere.  It works<br/>\nquite well at taking down mobs with little risk to the group.  The only<br/>\nproblem is that the ranger (high 30s) takes all the damage if the mob<br/>\nresists fear and starts attacking us.  I know the ranger is inflicting more<br/>\nmelee damage than me but the fear song is supposed to have a high taunt<br/>\nfactor.  You would think that after hitting a mob with fear constantly over<br/>\nseveral rounds I would piss them off some.  Not so.  In a bad combat with<br/>\nmultiple fear resists, the ranger will often be at half health while I will<br/>\nstill be at almost full health.  I&#39;ve even tried weaving in Hymn to try and<br/>\nmove myself up the hate list in order to get the mob to attack me and spread<br/>\nout damage some.  That doesn&#39;t work either.  I can see why a lot of rangers<br/>\nhave been complaining about this recently.  I guess its a step in the right<br/>\ndirection that they are getting a spell to move them down the hate list.<br/>\nThey probably need it a lot earlier than they are getting it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they screwed up by<br/>\nnot increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face they give Rangers<br/>\na spell to lower their hate list factor.

I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>\nbeing literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
