I group with a monk on a regular <br/>\nbasis (in a 40-ish group) and he routinely takes full damage WHEN he is hit. <br/>\nI take full damage maybe half the time (unless my luck is running short =).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a big issue toward the end of phase 3 beta. I played a wizard and <br/>\nwas able to actually tank better than many of my cleric buddies until Verant <br/>\nchanged the rules of armor, and I quote one of the dev guys in chat after <br/>\nthat particular patch: &quot;I got sick of casters in their paper suits tanking, <br/>\nthat was not our original intent&quot;. I was stunned and very humbled by this <br/>\nchange, and very quickly learned to keep myself out of the front lines <br/>\nshortly thereafter. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nA bard friend of mine who was outfitted in full platewas pulled aside by a <br/>\nGM to test the changes in the armor code. The GM gave him various sets of <br/>\narmor to try out and would sic critters on him to see the effects of damage. <br/>\nThe difference between leather and plate was like night and day, and in my <br/>\nopinion still is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 38th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
