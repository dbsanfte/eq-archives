Of course  one thing to consider -<br/>\nwhen you have a Shaman you don&#39;t just have healing - you have slow mob...<br/>\n<br/>\nI WAS four blue bubs away from 53 - but due to an un-rez&#39;d death (long story<br/>\ninvolving my own stupidity...) I&#39;m not back to five - so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>\nto 53.  I&#39;m in a small guild where we have a core group of people around<br/>\n47-51.  We do have a 54 cleric but he is either rarely on - or on alternates<br/>\nnot in guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe core group in addition to me is Four Druids between 46-53; two 49/51<br/>\nPaladins; and a 49 Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Do you all think that a Bard/Druid/Paladin group can handle the &quot;hard&quot;<br/>\nareas?  What minimum levels should my partners be?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Any advise on where to go &quot;practice&quot; my crowd control skills and the<br/>\ngroups efforts in general without worry about group wipes?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nChardok zone-out.  On Xegony it&#39;s usually pretty empty and you can hunt at<br/>\nthe zone out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.

But I think you&#39;ll find that a lot of the<br/>\n&quot;needing&quot; Enchanters and<br/>\n&quot;needing&quot; Clerics came from people doing all of this stuff with groups<br/>\naveraging around level 52, and not<br/>\nknowing how to pull the dungeon properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done a lot of Sebilis, and 3 of the four wings of HS, and fairly deep<br/>\ninto Chardok without an<br/>\nEnchanter or a Cleric.  A Shaman makes it easier, but Druids have the same<br/>\nhealing capability, so if they<br/>\nknow how to heal (many don&#39;t, they soloed too much), they work fine also.<br/>\nPaladins (now that they fixed<br/>\nthe mana pool for Hybrids) also work.  It&#39;s better to have two alternate<br/>\nhealers if you&#39;re missing a<br/>\nCleric, but (just as an example) I did Guardian, Zoneout and the hallway<br/>\ndown to Disco the other night<br/>\nwith an Enchanter, a Paladin, a Rogue and myself.  Just the four of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo don&#39;t despair.  You&#39;re a little low-level still, Slyde.  When you get<br/>\nSong of Twilight and you get a<br/>\nlittle more practice, you should see what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer worry much even if we pull four.  Five gets me going a bit, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve lived through every<br/>\nfive-pull I&#39;ve had for over a month.  I&#39;ve had several fights recently where<br/>\nI was mezzing no fewer than<br/>\nthree MOBs the entire time, for a total of over 10 MOBs.  (We didn&#39;t get 10<br/>\nat once, we kept getting adds,<br/>\nthough.)  Use overhead view, remember that you can target the next MOB as<br/>\nsoon as you start the song on<br/>\nthe previous one, don&#39;t sweat the resists.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really love going there with my Shaman or Paladin friend, inviting some<br/>\npeople at zonein, and then<br/>\ntelling them we&#39;re going to necros or something.  What!  We have no<br/>\nEnchanter!  We have no Cleric!  You<br/>\ncan feel the panic rising.  They all have a great time, though.
