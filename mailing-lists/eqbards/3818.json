Baseball cards.  They&#39;re just<br/>\n&gt;pieces of cardboard with ink printed on them.  But many many<br/>\n&gt;people enjoy collecting them, enough so that they will pay<br/>\n&gt;much more for a rare one than you and I probably make in a<br/>\n&gt;year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this makes it sensible?  I think not.  I have the same opinion of people<br/>\nwho pay thousands of dollars for a baseball card or a barbie doll or a<br/>\nMcDonalds happy meal toy or a beanie baby or any one of a million other<br/>\n&quot;collectables&quot; as I do of people who pay hundreds of dollars for a few<br/>\nvirtual digits in a make believe world on a server that could go poof at any<br/>\ntime.  They have ALOT more money than they need and ALOT more money than<br/>\ngood sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(If you really want something to ponder, most real-life money<br/>\n&gt;nowadays is nothing more than electronic bits on bank<br/>\n&gt;computers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Granted, but you know what?  It would take alot more than a simple single<br/>\ncomputer crash to make that jar full of quarters and one dollar bills on my<br/>\nnightstand (that serves as a tangible reminder that I&#39;m saving for a<br/>\nvacation) absolutely worthless.  Whereas... if EQ has a nervous breakdown at<br/>\nsome point and all the bank accounts get wiped out... that idiot that paid<br/>\n$600 or something for 1000 plat in game is out $600 with nothing to show for<br/>\nit.... and EQ wouldnt reimburse him for it either, in game OR out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
