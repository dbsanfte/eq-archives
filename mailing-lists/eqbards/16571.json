You all do too.  I wouldn&#39;t rule out ideas based on whether<br/>\n  or not it can be done.  Because if we did that, we&#39;d have no songs<br/>\n  at all... hahaha... errr, that was bad... anyway.  I like your<br/>\n  idea, needs to be fleshed out more, maybe tweaked, but it&#39;s most<br/>\n  definitely original.  That song coupled with Group Healing would<br/>\n  be really nice.  And like I said before, if we present a decent<br/>\n  list of possibilities to them they may come up with something<br/>\n  similiar.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nice idea!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
