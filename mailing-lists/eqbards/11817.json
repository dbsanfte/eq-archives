What&#39;s<br/>\ncrippling is Verant having nerfed anything resembling a trade<br/>\nskill to the point where they&#39;re pointless, unprofitable, or<br/>\nineffective.  That means the *only* way to achieve anything in<br/>\nthis game is via leveling.  UO is way ahead of EQ on this<br/>\npoint (which in part is why UO has such different problems<br/>\nthan EQ, or EQ doesn&#39;t have some of the problems UO has if you<br/>\nwant to think of it that way).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
