I was wearing Banded, Loved the look, hated the<br/>\n&gt; helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>\n&gt; looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>\n&gt; Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>\n&gt; buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>\n&gt; like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>\n&gt; went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>\n&gt; Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>\n&gt; helms, too :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyone noticed almost every helm in the game is ugly? Definately every<br/>\nplate helm is with the possible exception of the Trolls, which looks<br/>\nvaguely ok. The only decent helm I&#39;ve found is the silk turban, which<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t show on your character at all. It has pretty decent AC but the<br/>\nexecutioner&#39;s hood is so much better stat wise, and even the blackened<br/>\ncrown is probably more useful. The hood looks completely retarded on my<br/>\nhalf elf though. It looks like I should have some wool mittens on<br/>\nstrings to go with it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually just wear the BI Crown, dispite the donut head look. The extra<br/>\nmagic resists sure seem to help, as I rarely seem to take damage from<br/>\nthe casters in lower guk, and get rooted once in a blue moon compared to<br/>\nmost people down there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
