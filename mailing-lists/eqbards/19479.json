White and up is a pain in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1054489792\">I did it like this:<br/>\n1. Jig of Vigor<br/>\n2. Screech<br/>\n3. Selo&#39;s<br/>\n4. HoR<br/>\n5. Chain<br/>\n6. BBB<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA rule I always went by is, only fear kite on blues.  White and up is a<br/>\npain in the ass and really not worth the pain/death and time involved (imho).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFind a target then give yourself one pulse of Selo&#39;s.  Next try to chain<br/>\nyour target.  If it resists then you have enough time to try again while<br/>\nrunning.  If for some reason you fail a second time I would suggest hitting<br/>\nSelo&#39;s again and starting over until chains sticks.  Next stay a little a<br/>\nhead of your target while you fire up Screech.  Just as it is about to &quot;go<br/>\noff&quot; take a step towards the target but out of it&#39;s swinging range.  If you<br/>\ntime it right the mob will run away with out ever getting a hit in on you,<br/>\nthe bashes are a bitch.  If it resists then stand there and take the<br/>\nbeating like a man until you fear it.  Then just chain - fear - chain -<br/>\nfear.  If it resists a fear then try until you get it.  Fear is more<br/>\nimportant then chains so don&#39;t worry just yet if chains wears off while you<br/>\nare trying to get fear to stick.  Fear is what keeps you from getting your<br/>\nass whipped.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf the target is getting a little to far from the kiting area that you<br/>\nlike then keep it chained, stop fearing it and let it follow you back to<br/>\nthe area.  This is also good if there is a wandering mob that it is getting<br/>\ntoo close to as you don&#39;t really want to worry about more problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI keep Jig mem&#39;d because I have low Wood Elf STA and it drains after a<br/>\ncouple minutes.  I will only twist Jig in to the routine if I didn&#39;t have a<br/>\nresist on the last chain and the last fear.  Try not to let your STA bar<br/>\nfall below 2 bubbles.  Keep bellow mem&#39;d incase you have to kite, and I<br/>\nwould suggest switching to a drum if it comes to this.  If you are low on<br/>\nhealth/STA you will need the little extra speed the drum will give you.<br/>\nAnd of course HoR to heal yourself if neeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 06:19 AM 6/7/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;(I ask this question inspite of the nerf yesterday)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve only had screech for a little while but have<br/>\n&gt;found that two or three resists and I take huge<br/>\n&gt;amounts of damage from a very angry mob when fear<br/>\n&gt;kiting. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is what I&#39;ve been doing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fear-kite bank<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.
