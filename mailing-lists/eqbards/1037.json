I <br/>\nalso admit I scaled back my search somewhat out of concern over some nasty <br/>\nprisoners I&#39;ve heard about in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a bank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>\nequipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>\nso camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>\nhighly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>\nAccelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>\nrather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>\nI suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>\nplace, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
