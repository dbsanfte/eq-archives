I would try talking to<br/>\nThalanx (if you&#39;re not already) or Iisbliss, or Deidda, they are all very<br/>\nnice and reasonable.  However, if they are the same sort of guild as when<br/>\nthey were on Sol Ro.  We dealt with their time zone advantage, it was very<br/>\nrough at times and Paradigm was pretty, well, happy, when they moved to A<br/>\nRo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we did have a Trak/VS arrangement with them back in the day, and I<br/>\nwill say that they ALWAYS held up their end of the deal.  So if you make a<br/>\ndeal, I would bet they would stick to it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHally<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Rokenn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 2:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Sleeper?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I can not get to EZBoards from work, so I can not comment on the <br/>\n&gt; thread you posted a link to.  I do know that EW(my guild) has been <br/>\n&gt; kicking around the idea of waking the Sleeper.  One of the main <br/>\n&gt; reasons they have been thinking about it is due to pressure from <br/>\n&gt; Darkwind.  Not to get too deep into ARo server politics, but DW was <br/>\n&gt; immense time zone advantage on ARo and uses it ruthlessly to their <br/>\n&gt; advantage (they are a mainly western Europe guild).  They are pretty <br/>\n&gt; much the number two guild on the server and have overran us before <br/>\n&gt; and not been very forthcoming in trying to work out any kind of <br/>\n&gt; arrangement on either Sleepers or N Tov.  And as far as some of the <br/>\n&gt; other upcoming guilds (SoT, CB, and others) they have been leaching <br/>\n&gt; off of EW&#39;s work for the last month or so.  Case in point was SoT & <br/>\n&gt; CB using CoH to try and do the back dragons in N ToV earlier this <br/>\n&gt; week to avoid having to fight the tougher mobs at the start.  Also <br/>\n&gt; PoM is getting very overcrowded, some nights we have had 30+ people <br/>\n&gt; run by us after we have cleared the way to PoM.  Now that we have <br/>\n&gt; cleared N ToV three (or four? can not remember) times it is starting <br/>\n&gt; to get a little old.  Leaving only 2 real challenges left, the 4th <br/>\n&gt; Warder and the AoW.  So I would suspect that EW will be making a real <br/>\n&gt; effort on Sleepers sometime in the future. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One interesting thing about Abashi&#39;s post regarding the changes <br/>\n&gt; wrought by waking the Sleeper is that it seems to allude to a quest <br/>\n&gt; to re-imprison him.  He also hinted at other changes to the zone and <br/>\n&gt; I have heard that the guards seem to be dropping more primal then <br/>\n&gt; they did in the past.  so it may not be as bad as it would seem if <br/>\n&gt; the Sleeper is let loose.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; &lt;thierry.cyr@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rokenn, let me right off the bat say I&#39;ve always had great respect <br/>\n&gt; for you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the work you&#39;ve put into your bard and your site.
