Well, if you call that help.  The whole<br/>\nthing woulda gone a lot better had we just sat at the &#39;stuck rock&#39; for 15 or<br/>\n20 minutes and let the little bastiage come to us.  But, oh no, I am a bard<br/>\nand I have tracking!  So, off I went, cruising thru HG valley, popping up<br/>\ntracking, not really looking in front too much when I agro&#39;d a Clops.  Hmm,<br/>\nshould be not problem, I&#39;ll just run out of his agro range.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I took another lap around HG Hill and then I saw you, another clops, a<br/>\ngiant skell and the first clops closing in from behind.  So, I ran over to<br/>\nfear them off, thinking we&#39;d fear and fight them one at a time. Well, when I<br/>\ngot there, I saw you had found Hasten and did not think that you might have<br/>\nDivine Aura up and not worried about some pesky clops.  Hey, it was like 1am<br/>\nfor me and I was not thinking too quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, it was too late and I feared Hasten as well as the clopsi & g-skel.<br/>\nSo, I figgered I&#39;d take the clops for a run while you did business with<br/>\nHasten.  Hmmm, about 3 bubs of hp later, I realized that little old Hasten<br/>\nhits pretty good for a gnome!  And trained him around the hill a couple<br/>\ntimes.  Finally, the best plan I could come up with was to train them all to<br/>\nthe Feer zone and let you find them pinned there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy now you had Atoned the clops and skels and was working on Hasten? The<br/>\nbest laid plans of bards and clerics sometimes (all the time?) go astray.<br/>\nSo, then I figgered I&#39;d just let Hasten kill me right by the stuck rock.<br/>\nSomehow you took the death but after that everything was non-agro.  So,<br/>\nGrifter hailed Hasten and kept him occupied while you made your way back and<br/>\ndid the bootie quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to turn a simple quest into total chaos, gimme a call - I can<br/>\npretty much do it every time!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 16, 2000 2:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Special Thanks to Sylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My cleric got jboots last night.
