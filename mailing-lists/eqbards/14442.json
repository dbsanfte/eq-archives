The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>\n&gt; everyone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>\n&gt; extras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>\n&gt; real quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>\n&gt; backside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>\n&gt; engagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>\n&gt; engage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>\n&gt; cleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>\n&gt; critical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>\n&gt; AI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that for entertainment&#39;s sake, we wouldn&#39;t really want it. I see the<br/>\npoint you are making, which is that it would require more strategy if they<br/>\nwere to fight and take damage in a more realistic fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPotentially, if we wanted realism, 1 good stick in the gut should disable<br/>\nany mob or player then, which kind of ruins any suspense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same reason that Hollywood sword fights are not anything like a<br/>\nreal life sword fight would probably be.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor mob AI, if the &quot;GM&quot; wanted to really spoil one&#39;s fun, then he&#39;d have the<br/>\nmobs adopt the same strategies as the players. At the beginning of a battle,<br/>\nthey&#39;d kill the casters first at all costs and keep them from casting. (Of<br/>\ncourse, then I&#39;d agree with Verant&#39;s &quot;binding&quot; justifications.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor real medieval combat, the winner would generally go to &quot;majority rules&quot;.<br/>\n2 vs 1 would usually means that the 2 would win. The single person might<br/>\nhave a better chance to survive depending on their skills, but it would be a<br/>\nsmall chance if the 2 know what they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also wouldn&#39;t have &quot;levels&quot;. Realistically, Muhammad Ali in his prime<br/>\nwould still get knocked out by 1 person hitting him from behind with a pipe.<br/>\nIn EQ a naked level 50 could stand around indefinitely while a<br/>\nstaff-wielding decaying skeleton whacked him over the head. It can be<br/>\nargued, though, which would be more fun, so I&#39;ll get back to the point<br/>\n(sorry I digressed).<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not necessarily sure that the engagement/disengagement system would<br/>\nreally be an improvement. The example given is the warrior and cleric vs. 1<br/>\nmob.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Mob attacks cleric and is considered &quot;engaged&quot;<br/>\n   Warrior gets massive bonuses against mob since mob is &quot;engaged&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t this essentially give everyone a &quot;backstab&quot; ability and change our<br/>\ntactics accordingly? This would also encourage just groups of 2, just like<br/>\nthe 2 rogues with backstab.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick a mob, 2 players take him down fast as the mob is always engaged. This<br/>\nis, of course, much more realistic, but for play balance and fun of the game<br/>\nI would think it&#39;d become boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this should work the other way around, 2 mobs vs 1 player, the player<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t stand a chance. That&#39;d be no fun either.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon reviewing this, I&#39;d have to say that I&#39;ve taken a very Verant view of<br/>\ncombat. It&#39;d be interesting to see whether a MUD with more &quot;realistic&quot;<br/>\ncombat would sell well, and it would depend on how far you&#39;d want to take<br/>\nthat realism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember my days playing &quot;hack&quot; which required a solo player to crawl<br/>\nthrough a dungeon. You&#39;d gain experience and equipment along the way, and<br/>\nmost of the time you&#39;d end up dying and creating a new character. I thought<br/>\nit hilarious that you could later come across some other adventurer&#39;s body<br/>\nand if you could keep his ghost occupied, you could loot his corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well. I ramble. Time to get back to work. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
