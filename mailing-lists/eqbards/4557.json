He<br/>\nsaid should like J.C. said, they&#39;ve made the planes extremly<br/>\nhard now. Creatures backstabbing for 400 damage when you try<br/>\nto portal in. Getting hit can teleport you to other parts of<br/>\nthe zone. He did mention before they made it impossible to get<br/>\nit about some of the armor. Hopefully he&#39;ll send it on in as<br/>\nwell as the rest of his guildmates. Paladin armor is blue.<br/>\nCleric armor is purple. Bard armor is yellow. Druid is green<br/>\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nchain. Ranger is green plate. Shaman is grey (not sure).<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYellow?  Why yellow?  I feel a barrage of coward jokes and<br/>\nhave-a-nice-day jokes coming...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
