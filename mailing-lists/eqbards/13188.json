They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I <br/>\n&gt;contend that bards die as often as any single casting class.  Regardless of <br/>\n&gt;arguments about travel time (e.g. bards don&#39;t need binding because they run <br/>\n&gt;so fast - which would also eliminate druids from needing bind, as they can <br/>\n&gt;SoW, SoC, and port about), the reason why some classes have bind is claimed <br/>\n&gt;to be due solely to the frequency of deaths of said class. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
