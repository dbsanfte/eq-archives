To get ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1903461128\">Okay,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrass horns are sold in Kelethin, Freeport, and Qeynos bard guilds.  I have<br/>\nseen them for sale in all three places.  Krak sells them, as well.  To get<br/>\nKrak to sell to you, as dubious, use the &#39;sneak&#39; method.  Get a successful<br/>\nsneak going, and he will be indifferent to you.  Right click, and viola, you<br/>\ncan sell/buy with Krak.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for your brass skill...Get lots of food and water, then go to the<br/>\nArena, off of Lake Rathe.  (Into the water from zone, off to the right,<br/>\nwhere an Avi is (sometimes) sitting on a dock, near two Chicken Huts).  Get<br/>\nbound or not...doesn&#39;t matter.  Zone into the hallway, and step away from<br/>\nthe zone, to be nice to all the fine folks coming here to get bound.  Have<br/>\nDDD memmed up, equip that horn, and start...c&#39;mon, start...i mean<br/>\nstart...after all those missed notes, get DDD started.  Sit or stand,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now IRL, go away for a while.  Go to bed, go to work, go get something<br/>\nto eat...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom one practice point in brass (which should have given me a skill of 12<br/>\n(lvl 11 + 1 practive point), since I put my point into it when I could) it<br/>\ntook me approximately 4 hours to max my brass skill at 95 for level 18<br/>\n(5*lvl + 5).  I have heard of some doing it in closer to 2 hours, and some<br/>\ntaking longer.  IF you did NOT put a point into brass at 11, and waited<br/>\nuntil 18th, your skill increases will be faster, since you don&#39;t have to<br/>\novercome those hard-to-get 7, and may shorten the time required immensely.<br/>\nIf you put alot of practice points into it, it should reduce the time as<br/>\nwell.  Due to the clumpy number generator, though, these times may vary<br/>\ngreatly, just due to lags in improvement and large jumps in improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther areas, which I don&#39;t consider to be as safe to do this:<br/>\nFar back in the cave behind Shady Swashbuckler, in East Commons  (someone<br/>\ncould screw up, attack him, and lead him your direction)<br/>\nNewbie area, out by zone line - sitting near one of the zone lines in front<br/>\nof the gates of a city - again, someone could drag a guard out far enough to<br/>\nbe affected, and they kill quick.<br/>\nJust over zone line from WFP into NRO.  Dark Elf - &#39;nuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, Arena seems to best place to do this.  Only players there, and<br/>\nusually only those coming to bind.  Just step out of the way, maybe around<br/>\ncorner, and no-one will notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough<br/>\n19th Song Bard and PROUD owner of his first Lambent armour<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 20, 1999 7:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] The old brass problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;chris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the reason there is unfinished horns is the same reason why there<br/>\n&gt; are lute strings. as you may know there has been rumors that there is a<br/>\n&gt; skill we will get eventually if they ever get it working that allows us to<br/>\n&gt; create instruments. Problem is going to krak the aviak merchant is I am<br/>\n&gt; dubious to him. So I guess Ill just have shout out for someone with<br/>\nfaction<br/>\n&gt; to look for me.
