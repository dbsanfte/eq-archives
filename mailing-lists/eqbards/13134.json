I have seen lizzies get stuck on a <br/>\nlevel and stepping on steps to a level frees them up.

The point I was trying to make was that this location was not a good <br/>\nplace to try the two bards and Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest going to a lowish level dungeon to try the lullably and two bards. <br/>\n  Black Burrow comes to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer Fflamson  only bard in guild or I would do this myself!!

The Archon Temple is fun to hold and great<br/>\n&gt;experience when held in a sportsmanlike fashion, however, I am only human<br/>\n&gt;and have used these pieces of information to save my cute bardic ass a few<br/>\n&gt;times when I&#39;ve gotten into a jam.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>\n&gt;which groups exploit this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>\n&gt;and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>\n&gt;and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>\n&gt;that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>\n&gt;steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>\n&gt;and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>\n&gt;the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>\n&gt;lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>\n&gt;clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>\n&gt;Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an <br/>\n&gt;on/off<br/>\n&gt;switch for mob activity and movement.  The exploit part of this occurs once<br/>\n&gt;these lizards have come to the puller at the steps.  If the puller to whom<br/>\n&gt;the lizards are aggrod removes himself from the steps they will once again<br/>\n&gt;&quot;freeze&quot; due to the pathing bug.  The group can now fire at will with <br/>\n&gt;little<br/>\n&gt;chance of the lizards leaving the steps to actively engaging them in melee.<br/>\n&gt;Other melee members of the party can sometimes melee the lizard on the <br/>\n&gt;steps<br/>\n&gt;in safety - it&#39;s as though the hate list of these buggy lizards doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;reorganize itself.  Regardless of the damage others do to them, the lizards<br/>\n&gt;remain aggrod on the first guy that bonked them on the head.  If the <br/>\n&gt;lizards<br/>\n&gt;*do* engage in melee, the entire party can move away from the steps to the<br/>\n&gt;first 90 degree corner (either seems to work) and the lizards have another<br/>\n&gt;very good chance of freezing when the party reaches the corner.  A group<br/>\n&gt;that knows how to work the pathing of the lizards up there can have a <br/>\n&gt;*very*<br/>\n&gt;safe time of taking out lizzies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been in groups that had the puller deliberately go out and smack as<br/>\n&gt;many lizzies as possible to create a 12 liz train to the Archon.  Once<br/>\n&gt;there, the puller stands on the steps and takes a bit of abuse while all <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;lizards catch up.  Then the puller does his best to arrange the lizards <br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt;as closely knit a group as possible on the steps, then jumps from the steps<br/>\n&gt;freezing them all in place.  Wizards and Mages then AE the whole bundle <br/>\n&gt;down<br/>\n&gt;at their leisure.  I quickly departed these groups because this is BORING <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;hell, and actually not any faster (I&#39;d argue slower) than a good<br/>\n&gt;old-fashioned fight or three.  The only reason I was invited was as a mana<br/>\n&gt;pump for the casters.  Basically I was to stand around watching and playing<br/>\n&gt;Clarity continuously.  Forget it - the Throne Room is more fun and better<br/>\n&gt;potential loot in that case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of the<br/>\n&gt;temple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>\n&gt;of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>\n&gt;spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>\n&gt;the Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>\n&gt;safety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if <br/>\n&gt;caught<br/>\n&gt;doing this).  Large races will either need a levitation (maybe a shrink<br/>\n&gt;would work too) or old Guise of the Deceiver in order for them to reach the<br/>\n&gt;top.  If the situation with the lizards gets unmanageable, simply camp out<br/>\n&gt;up here and come back to clear their aggro lists.  All members of your <br/>\n&gt;party<br/>\n&gt;must camp for this to work.  I have camped overnight on the top here many<br/>\n&gt;times.  Lizards simply cannot get up here, and the two or three times that<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve seen it they 32k (suicide) themselves.  I have *never* heard that<br/>\n&gt;running to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting from<br/>\n&gt;here is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Use your knowledge wisely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So what you are saying is that because pathing is screwed up at the top <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the temple, mobs standing on the steps will not move down to the bottom <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the steps and attack anyone standing there?  That may explain why I <br/>\n&gt;rarely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got attacked.  I was standing at the bottom of the steps along with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric and enchanter.  The other three characters were on the steps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meleeing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
