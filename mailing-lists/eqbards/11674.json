As a 35 year old professional programmer<br/>\n&gt; myself, I have a very good idea of what it takes to design and complete an<br/>\n&gt; effort as massive as EverQuest.  Verant has done an outstanding job.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there someone at Verant in Testing/QA/QC that would be more appropriate<br/>\n&gt; to send email to regarding testing the subtleties of Bard songs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason Farque&#39;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In recent email communications between you and another Bardic player, you<br/>\n&gt; indicated that there have been no changes to the level 15 Bard song &quot;Kelin&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Lucid Lullaby&quot;.  As a 37th level Bard with a great deal of experience with<br/>\n&gt; this song I can assure you that its behavior has changed.  The change in the<br/>\n&gt; song has been felt by Bards at all levels, it&#39;s not merely my personal<br/>\n&gt; perception of the song&#39;s having changed for me over time.  In fact the same<br/>\n&gt; behavioral changes have effected the level 28 song &quot;Crission&#39;s Pixie<br/>\n&gt; Strike&quot;.  The changes feel unintentional, as the success/resist messages<br/>\n&gt; that we receive no longer correctly correspond to mob behavior as they used<br/>\n&gt; to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I explain the behavior of Pixie Strike first as it&#39;s easier to explain and<br/>\n&gt; to test.  Lullaby&#39;s behavior is the same, except for a radius and multiple<br/>\n&gt; mobs:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PIXIE STRIKE:<br/>\n&gt; Very often if you attempt to mesmerize a mob with Pixie Strike you will<br/>\n&gt; receive a blue &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message indicating a success, and yet the<br/>\n&gt; mob will attack in its next round as though it resisted.  Repeatedly<br/>\n&gt; successfully Pixie Striking a mob will increase the chances of the song<br/>\n&gt; &quot;taking hold&quot;.  After some 3-5 successful Pixie Strikes, the mob will in<br/>\n&gt; fact be mezzed.  After a single successful mez, mob behavior begins to<br/>\n&gt; correctly correspond to the success/resist messages that you receive.  One<br/>\n&gt; way to test this song would be to buff yourself to level 30 or so and<br/>\n&gt; attempt to mez a blue mob in Runnyeye, Sol A or Unrest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; LULLABY:<br/>\n&gt; Using Lullaby against very low level mobs such as can be found in newbie<br/>\n&gt; zones or BlackBurrow this song will successfully &quot;nod&quot; many or all mobs in<br/>\n&gt; its radius.  A very large percentage of those mobs will attack in their next<br/>\n&gt; round despite zero resist messages.  Iteratively applying this song to the<br/>\n&gt; same mobs yields increasingly &quot;correct&quot; results.  In other words if I play<br/>\n&gt; the song for 8 mobs, all 8 might &quot;nod&quot; without resist messages but 5 will,<br/>\n&gt; in their next round, turn to me and deliver attacks as though they resisted.<br/>\n&gt; The next pulse of the song might &quot;nod&quot; all mobs again, but only 3 will<br/>\n&gt; deliver attacks in their next round, etc.  Using this song as we did before<br/>\n&gt; it changed (similarly to the way an Enchanter might use Mesmerization) is<br/>\n&gt; impossible, as the Bard is placed high on the aggro list of the unoccupied<br/>\n&gt; mobs, and yet they are not &quot;mezzed&quot; despite success messages.  This new<br/>\n&gt; behavior of lullaby generally leads to swift death at the hands of multiple<br/>\n&gt; mobs, so very few of the highly competent bards that I know and converse<br/>\n&gt; with in-game and via the &quot;eqbards&quot; email list at onelist.com even attempt to<br/>\n&gt; use this song any longer.  One way to test this song would be to buff<br/>\n&gt; yourself to level 25 or so and play it for the green mobs in Kerra Isle or<br/>\n&gt; Blackburrow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you sincerely for your time and the great game.
