If you had the<br/>\ntwo stacked, then Accelerando (because it gets refreshed every<br/>\n6 seconds) was taking precedence.  If you waited for<br/>\nAccelerando to fade then zoned, then only SoW was in effect<br/>\nand you were moving at the slower SoW speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you didn&#39;t want for Accelerando to fade and zoned, then you<br/>\nhad both effects up when you got through.  When Accelerando<br/>\nfaded, it put you at the unenhanced running speed, even though<br/>\nthe SoW icon was still up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe textures for different zones vary in resolution, and thus<br/>\ngive the illusion of moving at different speeds.  You will<br/>\nnotice the same thing if you play without SoW and Accelerando.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already mentioned that if you go through a zone with<br/>\nAccelerando active, when you come out the other side it seems<br/>\nto default to the base Accelerando speed (no drum, possibly<br/>\nzero skill).  It&#39;s possible SoW also speeds up as the caster<br/>\nlevels, and zoning resets it to its slowest possible speed.<br/>\n(If this is the case, and that&#39;s a lot of &quot;ifs,&quot; then the SoW<br/>\nspeeds in my timings are a bit off.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
