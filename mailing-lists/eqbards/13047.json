He&#39;s probably<br/>\nkilled quite a few over the years and collected their instruments as<br/>\ntrophies.  If a player kills Mayong, there might be a chance he drops<br/>\nKelin&#39;s lute or the small brass trumpet as part of the loot.  Mayong is<br/>\nsupposedly in the game, but you can&#39;t get to him because of pathing problems<br/>\nand therefore can&#39;t kill him.  So technically these magic instruments are<br/>\n&quot;in the game&quot;, but no one can ever obtain them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just blind speculation on my part but wouldn&#39;t it be tremendously<br/>\nironic if it were true:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Many thanks for the praise.  I haven&#39;t seen any clues to either of these<br/>\n&gt; items.  Of course it could well be like the component for the summon<br/>\n&gt; corpse<br/>\n&gt; spell started out.  They should be in the game, but if GZ even has a<br/>\n&gt; different client than every live person out there, chances are there a lot<br/>\n&gt; more things they think they put in that never made it to the live servers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll redouble my efforts in looking for them but none of the usual suspect<br/>\n&gt; merchants have them.  maybe if you do one of the quests 30 times you will<br/>\n&gt; get one of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of all the people I know on E&#39;ci, Kitasi has done more quests than anyone<br/>\n&gt; else.  If he hasn&#39;t gotten any clues yet about these instruments, then I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; inclined to believe that they fall into the Fiery Avenger category.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brass <br/>\n&gt; &gt; trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people<br/>\n&gt; sell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good<br/>\n&gt; faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with some of them to get a quest?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
