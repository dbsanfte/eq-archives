When<br/>\nEQ first came out, I thought long and hard about what class I&#39;d play.  An<br/>\nEnchanter friend told me that she&#39;d seen lots and lots of other classes, but<br/>\nhardly any Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut honestly, the thing that sealed it for me was when she told me that one<br/>\nof the developers had a soft spot for Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still happy with my choice, though.  The day I stop playing my Bard is<br/>\nthe day I stop playing EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyri</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
