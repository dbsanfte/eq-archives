I know for a fact that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speed/connection of you computer is important in <br/>\n&gt; determining your running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speed.  One night I went hunting a friend who was <br/>\n&gt; attempting to run the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game on a Pentium 150 with 32mb RAM and suffice to say she <br/>\n&gt; was insanely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slow.  Heck my mage was moving faster than her walking then she (a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paladin) was running.  So perhaps your connection was <br/>\n&gt; better or perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like we all know SOW just rocks.  Speaking of which being a bard has<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yup, that&#39;s why all the SoW timings I have were done via SoW<br/>\n&gt; cast on my character.  Same computer, same connection, and<br/>\n&gt; often times same location and time of day (accounting for<br/>\n&gt; variable lag).  I always do a baseline check with normal<br/>\n&gt; running speed every time I do another test, and normalize<br/>\n&gt; against that before adding it to the chart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm, I wonder if this means I have an excuse for getting<br/>\n&gt; JBoots... :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
