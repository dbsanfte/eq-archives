BUT, you need to con<br/>\nthem from extreme range and make sure they are NOT King Xorbb!  He is very<br/>\naggressive and terrible!  He saw my Bard when he was 17 or 18 and cast a very<br/>\nnasty combination of spells that left me dead in seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, I think Beholder is easier to traverse than HHP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to run through Beholder with Accelerando?  I made the trip<br/>\n&gt; through last weekend crawling along high on the cliff and it was nerve<br/>\n&gt; wracking.  I would much rather make a fast dash through and get it over<br/>\n&gt; with!  But I saw at least a dozen evil eyes from my vantage point on the<br/>\n&gt; cliff wall...can I run past fast enough to avoid trouble?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Paralto of Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!
