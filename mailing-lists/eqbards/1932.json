This is what happened to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in Kelethin talking to the dwarf who you give bandit tongues to.<br/>\nHe asked if I was a member of 628. I said, &quot;I am a member of 628.&quot; He<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Sorry friend, but I can&#39;t trust you yet...&quot; I sand him a song,<br/>\nand said, &quot;I am a member of 628.&quot; He said, &quot;Then it is my duty to tell<br/>\nyou of the guild tasks.&quot; Something like that. Made me laugh anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nBard from Qeynos<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nI have found that the most usefull aspect of the level 11 song is its<br/>\nability<br/>\nto grant the singer quests.  Using this song I can attempt or recieve<br/>\nany good<br/>\naligned races/classes quest.  I have tried this in several cities and<br/>\nknow that<br/>\nit is the truth. I try and hail the person, talk a bit and they give a<br/>\n&quot;once<br/>\nyou are in better standing then we will talk&quot; message.  Sing the level<br/>\n11 song<br/>\nthen repeat the last quest cue.  Voila! instant quest. :)<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver, Vizier of Akalabeth<br/>\nThe Lost Order of Akalabeth<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
