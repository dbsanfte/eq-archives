Also High Keep pickclaws.<br/>\nIf you and the shaman can camp the ramp, you should be able to do well<br/>\nwithout making any of the rooms too mad.  Or maybe the Lookout Room if you<br/>\ncan get it.  Also, that guy in the Highkeep jail - Osarian? Good xp til<br/>\n30ish?  Also, your 35 sha should be able to pull Runnyeye gobs to the zone<br/>\nwhere you can fite them.  If your shaman can pull single shadow men and you<br/>\ncan damage them that might be an option too.  Going to need a lot of healing<br/>\nand MR buffing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPowerleveling is still lots and lots of killing - dont expect that you will<br/>\nget like a level in an hour or 2.  Getting a bubble of XP per hour is what I<br/>\nwould consider really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 45 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 10, 2000 7:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Need Advice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The following may not be ethical to some of you but oh well.. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been lacking in time lately to play my bard.. he is level 23.
