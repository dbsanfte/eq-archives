There&#39;s a passage down<br/>\nthere that will take you into the cave area and on to Trak&#39;s lair. I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t advise trying this without a high level multi group party, and<br/>\nwe haven&#39;t done it since the patch so it may be even harder with the<br/>\nrandom mob warping we are seeing now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
