Paladins have the Flaming Two-Handed Sword<br/>\n &gt; and 4 or 5 others, Shadowknights the same, of course all the casters have<br/>\n &gt; special items as well that boost mana or other things.<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; \tBut we bards have no BARD-SPECIFIC or even bard-flavored items<br/>\n &gt; that I know of.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a special drum that gave<br/>\n &gt; maybe a 10% boost to the Accelerando?  Or perhaps a fabled mandolin that<br/>\n &gt; could instead of merely boosting the healing song, also remove disease or<br/>\n &gt; poison or any adverse effects?  Heck, a weapon that acted as an instrument<br/>\n &gt; would be great, as well.  Bone bladed lute?  Well, maybe scratch that one,<br/>\n &gt; eh?<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; Later all, may your songs lift to the stars!<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; Pistov.<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; \t ___________________________________________________________<br/>\n &gt; \t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n &gt; \t|  Tyger, Tyger, burning bright\t       \t\t            |<br/>\n &gt; \t|  In the forests of the night,\t       Marc Allie\t    |<br/>\n &gt; \t|  What immortal hand or eye\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n &gt; \t|  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>   |<br/>\n &gt; \t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n &gt; \t|           -William Blake-\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n &gt; \t|___________________________________________________________|<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n &gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n &gt; Join today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
