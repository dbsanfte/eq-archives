With<br/>\n&gt; just me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill <br/>\n&gt; doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>\n&gt; and right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  <br/>\n&gt; There was a<br/>\n&gt; party of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped <br/>\n&gt; with a rogue<br/>\n&gt; and we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me <br/>\n&gt; but not the<br/>\n&gt; rogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They <br/>\n&gt; decided against<br/>\n&gt; adding us both.  We showed them up by using <br/>\n&gt; chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>\n&gt; next to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they <br/>\n&gt; did.  Since we<br/>\n&gt; had little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs <br/>\n&gt; than they did.<br/>\n&gt; And since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say <br/>\n&gt; we ended up<br/>\n&gt; getting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in <br/>\n&gt; refuses to add a<br/>\n&gt; rogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jamie Bedford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbedford@...\">bbedford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 12, 2000 3:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of <br/>\n&gt; awesome grouping<br/>\n&gt; so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?  Treasure your <br/>\n&gt; lower levels<br/>\n&gt; while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit <br/>\n&gt; waiting for a<br/>\n&gt; group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever <br/>\n&gt; waited was 4<br/>\n&gt; hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ <br/>\n&gt; carreer, but have a<br/>\n&gt; lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give <br/>\n&gt; up exp in a<br/>\n&gt; heartbeat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
