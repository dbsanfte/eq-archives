Get one of the<br/>\nlocal oger/trolls to kill some lizards and use one of those flutes.  Not<br/>\nsure if any are sold in Ogg or Feer - prolly only if a hunter sold one to a<br/>\nmerch.  You can get them from the gypsy merchants in Rathe Mts just past the<br/>\nInns on the way to the Lake Rathe zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nCT is not a good place for level 19/20 - unless you work the courtyard and<br/>\nare ready to zone fast.  And the Maze is a bad place period. High 30&#39;s and<br/>\neven 40&#39;s can get agro&#39;d and have a pack of lizzie on them in no time - not<br/>\nto mention getting lost.  I hate that maze! <br/>\n<br/>\nYour best bet is to try to find a high level player to help you CR.  When I<br/>\nwent there in my high 20&#39;s and low 30&#39;s stuff would see me.  My invis,<br/>\nother&#39;s invis, my bad luck - whatever - stuff would see me.  So, it&#39;s gonna<br/>\nbe real tough for you to try to drag your self out - unless you are close<br/>\nand know the maze.

I<br/>\n\t\twent because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>\n\t\thim.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>\n\t\tthen proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>\n\t\tnow have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>\n\t\tsomewhere in the maze.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhat I want to know is...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhere can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>\n\t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>\n\t\tto the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>\n\t\tby.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>\n\t\tspell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTomerrilin<br/>\n\t\tMithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
