Dunno just logged after levelling, guess <br/>\ni will see tomorrow =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I couldn&#39;t wait to try out the proc on the Staff of Writhing - <br/>\ndeemed the &quot;Ugly Stick&quot; by my girlfriend. I ran around the E Commons killin <br/>\neverything i saw just to see it proc (of course, careful not to KS anyone).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I too have found lvl 27 Song of the Sirens useful for thwarting <br/>\nnuking kill-stealers...they get REALLY frustrated, and it&#39;s well-deserved I <br/>\nfeel muahahaha! They only thing I really use it for in a typical combat <br/>\nsituation is when our fetcher pulls multiple mobs and the extra mobs begin <br/>\nto attack our healer. Charm it, let it walk it off a bit, then it comes <br/>\nafter you instead, freeing up your healer for casting. Haven&#39;t really messed <br/>\nwith Pixie Strike too much. I am thinking of finally forgetting Bellows <br/>\nafter using it so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nDidn&#39;t bother trying Curtailing Chant as I had to leave shortly after <br/>\nlevelling to 30 - anyone tried this out and can give a description of it&#39;s <br/>\neffect?<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until now I was using a Dirk/Obsidian Shard combo in melee. I was the tin <br/>\nrogue. Shard is a fun weapon to use btw (proc is useless on fire-based mobs <br/>\nthough), fast, decent dmg, and the effect is pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 30th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
