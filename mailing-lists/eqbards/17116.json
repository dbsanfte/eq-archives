Generally the pullers bring back 1-3 mobs which<br/>\nisn&#39;t too bad.  Occasionally mobs will spawn in the spots they bring the<br/>\npull back thru which leads to the bad pulls.  I have tried pulling but with<br/>\nno speed running and the pulling distances what they are in Sol A generally<br/>\nI am usually down to a bubble or two when I get back to the group.  I can<br/>\ngenerally do a better job of splitting the mobs though ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the tank unfortunately.  Its just me, and another bard generally.<br/>\nOccasionally we have a ranger but that&#39;s it.  Our guild is all made up of<br/>\nfairly casual players and no one else is willing to put up with 20+ minute<br/>\nruns every time they die so they all quit their melee characters some time<br/>\nago and play casters now.  Our entire guild has about 30 members I think.<br/>\nLess than a third are non-casters.  In truth I don&#39;t generally see anywhere<br/>\nnear as many non-casters in general.  The melee types I do see are nearly<br/>\nalways either twinks or quickly level out of my range because they play far<br/>\nmore time than I do.  Even our ranger remarked that he gave up hitting the<br/>\ntaunt button if I was singing hymn.  It just didn&#39;t matter he couldn&#39;t taunt<br/>\nanything off me after about 1 minute of fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, for Rp-ing reasons I want to pay my bard more than any other<br/>\ncharacter.  This is the only list I even bother to read anymore because it<br/>\nis so far beyond the other&#39;s in terms of good tips, great debates, and<br/>\ngenerally fun people that I quit all the others.  I just don&#39;t get to have<br/>\nmuch fun playing my bard anymore.  I had one really great nite in Sol A.<br/>\nThe next three times I went it was pretty bad.  The last time, I got 1/2 a<br/>\nbubble of experience in 3 hours.  I spent the entire time running, dying,<br/>\nrunning back to zone, fleeing some other groups train, running from a bad<br/>\npull, etc.  I would have actually had minus xp for the evening had I not<br/>\nbeen resurrected by a passing 50th cleric on his way into Sol B.<br/>\nUnfortunately he got there at the same time I did, so xp was the only thing<br/>\nI saved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get to play only 2 hours or less most times you sit down, that 20<br/>\nminute penalty for dying becomes quite huge.  The night I died 3 times I got<br/>\nto actually play for less than 30 minute.  the rest of my time was spent<br/>\nrunning back to my corpse.  Only one of those deaths was avoidable, the rest<br/>\nwere the result of being trained by another group or lone wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 11:14 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKit, <br/>\nIf I ever met a cleric with an attidude like that (ie let some one die to<br/>\nprove a point) I would quickly add him/her to my no group list.

In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other songs I<br/>\ndefinitely get the bulk of the attention.  The last 6 times we have had<br/>\ndeaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>\n1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other melee<br/>\nperson.  The two bards have died a combined 15 times in our Sol A guild<br/>\ngroups.  The other guildmembers have died a grand total of 6 times combined.<br/>\nEvery time there is a bad pull or we get trained its the bards that pay the<br/>\nprice.

Yes I could give us all a<br/>\nspeedup,<br/>\n&gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>\n&gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>\n&gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>\n&gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.
