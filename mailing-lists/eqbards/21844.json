I happen to be one of the bards who got caught in the <br/>\n&gt; stealth nerf<br/>\n&gt; of Lullaby so long ago.  One day I was saving my party from <br/>\n&gt; certain death,<br/>\n&gt; then the stealth nerf goes in, and now instead of saving the <br/>\n&gt; party, I save<br/>\n&gt; everyone but myself.  So for the few of us still around from <br/>\n&gt; release, I know<br/>\n&gt; how useful the song used to be.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
