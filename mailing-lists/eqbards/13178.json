Other classes have<br/>\nbeen doing tests on stats and their effect on melee quite a bit, and<br/>\nmore and more it&#39;s becoming clear that level and/or atk/def are the most<br/>\nimportant factors in your abilitys in melee. Tests have shown that str<br/>\ndoes nothing but raise your max damage, while your mean damage basically<br/>\nstays the same. The same tests show that agi over 100 does nothing.<br/>\nPeople are still in denial about this though, which is nice if you&#39;re<br/>\nstill trying to unload those serp bracers and mithril breastplates. It&#39;s<br/>\ntoo bad bards were left off the black enamalled breastplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a while ago one of my friends mentioned that his warrior continued<br/>\nto be more effective after all his skills had maxed, all the way to L50<br/>\nwhere he said he was much better than he had been at L39.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
