I think everyone will<br/>\nagree the camping vs dungeon crawling problem is a direct result of a bad<br/>\ndesign decision when EQ was just an idea in the programmer&#39;s mind.  I think<br/>\neveryone will agree that server overcrowding is a direct result of bad<br/>\nforecasts by Verant on how long it would take people to reach 50 and how<br/>\nlong it would take them to complete the expansion.  They obviously<br/>\nmiscalculated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe key issue as I see it is does Verant have a solution that will fix both<br/>\nproblems?  It might be that Verant doesn&#39;t consider camping a problem and<br/>\nhave no intentions of ever changing the design.  The recent discussion on<br/>\npossible ways to implement dungeon crawling could all be wasted words.<br/>\nVerant has said all along the game was designed where once you get to 50,<br/>\nyou retire your character until the expansion comes out and start a new one.<br/>\nSo what happens when the expansion comes out and a few months down the road<br/>\nyou have a bunch of level 75 characters complaining about overcrowding again<br/>\nand threatening to cancel their subscription if they don&#39;t add stuff for<br/>\nlevel 75 characters to do? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that Verant is in this to make money so its in their best<br/>\ninterest to appease their clientele.  Until they tell us their intentions<br/>\nfor the future of EQ, all we can do is speculate.  I do think it would be a<br/>\nsmart move on their part to share their future plans with us so we can<br/>\nprovide feedback now instead of when its too late and already in the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion is that we are unlikely to see resolution on any major<br/>\nissue affecting EQ until EQ2 comes out.  As a result,  I&#39;m not going to let<br/>\nit upset me whatsover at this point.  If I find that down the road I no<br/>\nlonger enjoy the game as much as I do now, I&#39;ll just move on to another<br/>\ngame.  In no way will it detract from my EQ experience.  EQ was the best<br/>\nmoney I ever spent on a computer game.  There are a lot of good games that<br/>\nhave come out since April 99 that I haven&#39;t played because of EQ.  Diablo 2<br/>\nis just around the corner so I know for a fact I won&#39;t be playing as much EQ<br/>\nwhen it does.  Neverwinter Nights eventually as well.  By the time I get<br/>\ntired of these two games plus any others that come out, EQ2 will most likely<br/>\nbe out.  I&#39;m looking forward to playing a new incarnation of Galtin when it<br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (who always tries to remember to change the subject line<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s the one guilty of starting most of the OT threads)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; People are lazy about changing the subject.  :)  I wasn&#39;t very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interested in the overcrowding thread, but someone made the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comment that they got a chance to play the game as Brad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intended - dungeon crawling.  Then I said crawling and camping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were mutually exclusive.  Then a bunch of people posted ideas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about how to make the game crawling-based instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; camping-based, which is when I started putting (OT) on it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry about not changing the subject line.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok you win, sorry :-).  I still say it don&#39;t have a chance of ever flying<br/>\n&gt; until they solve the over crowding problem though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
