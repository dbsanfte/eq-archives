Then if charm is still holding, you can sing another song like Hymn of Restoration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, when using the &quot;lull&quot; type song, do mulitple uses of it increase the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;anti-hatred&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our Lugubrious Lament only lower&#39;s the aggro range of the creature, like any other lull spell. Using a string instrument will help make the aggro range even smaller. Just remember that the aggro range is never completely eliminated. For instance, say you have 2 mobs with one in the front and one in the back. If you lament in the one in the front it&#39;s aggro range is now very small. If you pull the mob in back and it runs through the front creature&#39;s small aggro range, then they will both come.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, it would be better to either Lament the creature in back and pull the front one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\nBertox<br/>\nRed Sky</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
