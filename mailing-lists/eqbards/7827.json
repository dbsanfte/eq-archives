If we can roleplay our rebirth after every death, then <br/>\nroleplaying this mode of transportation should present no further <br/>\ndifficulties.  The one thing I have learned from this list, however, is that <br/>\nit can be done without experience penalties.  I&#39;ve only ever used it as a <br/>\nlast resort when needing to quickly get from one side of the world to the <br/>\nother, but always with the understanding that I would lose a certain amount <br/>\nof experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a bard, my roleplaying extends to the following song, written as a <br/>\nwarning to other guild members who may be tempted:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dark Path<br/>\n<br/>\nA shadow follows ev&#39;ry step,<br/>\nA demon tastes the air.<br/>\nThey wait for those who take the path,<br/>\nThey wait within their lair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey watch the silent souls go by,<br/>\nFor those whose minds are slow.<br/>\nFor those whose steps are filled with fear,<br/>\nFor those who do not know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn innocent upon the path,<br/>\nMay never reach the end.<br/>\nA silent shadow in the night,<br/>\n&#39;gainst which they can&#39;t defend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo heed the warning, go by light,<br/>\nJust walk, where e&#39;er you go.<br/>\nDark paths are fast for those prepared,<br/>\nBut death awaits the slow.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Elegor Mandreskal of the Soerbaird<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 4 Oct 1999 15:54:54 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: RE: Bard vs Wizard race?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From a roleplaying point of view it is utterly ridiculous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, October 04, 1999 3:55 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: RE: [eqbards] Bard vs Wizard race?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well if it works it does sound like the fastest way to travel between<br/>\n&gt;continents.  No more waiting for the boat:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How would someone go about doing this to themselves?  I would guess that <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;only way we could kill ourselves without causing EXP loss would be with <br/>\n&gt;DDD,<br/>\n&gt;CofD, or bellow.  I have never tried targetting myself with these so have <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;idea if they damage you or not.  I thought I read somewhere that if you die<br/>\n&gt;from a DOT cast my a player while dueling you will still take an EXP loss.<br/>\n&gt;This could apply here also so you would only want to use it to get yourself<br/>\n&gt;very low and then bellow from there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, if this method does work, it only goes to show you that players will<br/>\n&gt;always figure out a way to do something that the game designer never<br/>\n&gt;contemplated.  While it would definately be an exploit, I would term it an<br/>\n&gt;ingenious exploit and not a stupid one:-).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
