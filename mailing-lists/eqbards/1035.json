Starting<br/>\nat Level 12, go to Paw. You won&#39;t regret it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI got enough loot AND experience there (at the same time) to stay there<br/>\nfrom Level 13 to until I got Level 19. And on Fenin Ro there is NEVER<br/>\nanyone there (2 people at 8:00 in the evening one night, amazing).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBefore I describe the place let me just say that I finished my banded set<br/>\nat Level 14, and finished my bronze platemail set at Level 18. I bought my<br/>\nfirst combine longsword at Level 15, and my second at Level 17. I still<br/>\nhave 200 plat left over.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd this was all solo . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBuy about 4 backpacks, you&#39;ll need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPaw is the home of the Splitpaw Gnolls. You can find it by heading<br/>\ndirectly south when you cross into S Karana from the Bridge from N Karana.<br/>\nYou will in time see hills and some rock spires that look like a Paw. There<br/>\nis a cave which leads to the zone entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt the entrance you will find Gnolls. Probably Level 8-10 or so. Most will<br/>\nignore you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEventually you will meet guards . . . which you can easily solo, and for<br/>\ngood exp. They are level 10-12 maybe. They may have cloth armor. Keep it.<br/>\nThey may have rusty weapons. Get used to destroying them, not worth their<br/>\nweight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou will also find Shamans. These are pretty weak, also about level 10-12.<br/>\nThey carry much better loot. Keep gems, they are lightweight and valuable.<br/>\nThe wooden totems sell for a plat a piece. The only weapon you should keep<br/>\nis the occasional cracked staff, which also sell for 1 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEventually, you will be able to take nobles. They are Level 13-15. They<br/>\ncarry cloth, gems, but also Snakeskin Armor, which sells for about 7 plat<br/>\nfor each piece to other players.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter that, you will find there are two big rooms which are often camped<br/>\nand which you should camp if you can. One room has three nobles, one<br/>\nCaptain (Level 16) and High Shaman Lenrel (Level 16 or 17). Lenrel carries<br/>\na Runed Totem Staff sometimes. Those sell for about 30 plat to other<br/>\nplayers. The other room has two nobles, three commanders (Level 15 or 16),<br/>\nand High Shaman Ren&#39;Rex. Rex also drops a staff from time to time. Captains<br/>\nand commanders drop snakeskin often.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tUse your lull song ALL the time. There is a place with 4 shamans and 2<br/>\nguards that I basically lived for two levels. I would lull up to 4 of em<br/>\nand take the other two one at a time. Worked great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe real kicker? Gnolls hate water. They won&#39;t swim after you to try to<br/>\nkill you. And almost everywhere is close enough to water to get there<br/>\nbefore you die. So trouble does not mean death.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere are some other secret places, and other things you will figure out<br/>\n(some monk quests as well). But this should be good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOh, and get used to being encumbered. Yes you can carry about 50 over your<br/>\nweight limit and still win every fight again things that con blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
