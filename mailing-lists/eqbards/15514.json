I&#39;m going to try to explore a<br/>\nlittle tonight.  I&#39;ve read somewere that there are a<br/>\ncouple of skels that are necro pets and to touch them<br/>\nis to die. Is this area in the southeast corner where<br/>\nthey are located?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the Login Server down?  My son is home sick and<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to log in.  I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nhe&#39;s doing anything wrong.  I installed Evermon here<br/>\nand tried to check, but can&#39;t connect.  However, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know whether this is because the server is down<br/>\nor Evermon won&#39;t work thru the Company&#39;s firewall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the good info on the Rathe Mtns,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  This is a duplicate.  Sorry, my work email seems<br/>\nsick today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
