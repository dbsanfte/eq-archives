It&#39;s not MY fault that I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bought them in the store, not my fault I lit a bunch of crushed up plants<br/>\n&gt;&gt;held together with chemically treated paper, which the paper is held round<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with glue, then stuck the fiberglass type material in my mouth and sucked<br/>\n&gt;&gt;on it while the opposite end was glowing red. Woohoo, using SaTaN, ahem,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;excuse me, s8n&#39;s, logic, I&#39;m bound to be a millionaire.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; OR<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; when you grow up you&#39;ll be able to tell the difference between right and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;wrong, between knowing what&#39;s the correct course of actions without someone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;telling you what they are. Or maybe some other kid wanting to blame<br/>\n&gt;&gt;everyone else for thier bullshit will shoot you (so they can be as cool as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the &quot;gangsta&#39;s&quot;) and your parents can sue the company that made the gun.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(since it won&#39;t be the kid who pulled the trigger&#39;s fault, no need to even<br/>\n&gt;&gt;put him in jail)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;At 06:30 PM 6/28/99 EDT, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrS8N@...\">MrS8N@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are certain<br/>\n&gt;creatures<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;who get caught in walls when you lure them there and then you can slowly,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;surely, bellow them to death.  I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question are mostly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found this spot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them and get<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t*<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that I--or anyone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is using your<br/>\n&gt;head<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a bunch of<br/>\n&gt;wacko<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass &quot;normal&quot;--stress the<br/>\n&gt;word<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.  Play how<br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and epitomy of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only<br/>\n&gt;&gt;problem I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;have ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple people mind<br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you see<br/>\n&gt;someone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;playing the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Cooter<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;21st no matter how I got here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;We&#39;ve just added a &quot;NO ATTACHMENTS&quot; option.
