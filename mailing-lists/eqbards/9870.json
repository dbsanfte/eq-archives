(Not very nice really)<br/>\nI had no chance melleeing Choon, he hit in the 70&#39;s, so I ran around for 20<br/>\nminutes trying to get people to help me kill him, finally got to Qeynos<br/>\nHill Zone and met a 39 Mage who killed him for me, and can you believe<br/>\nafter all that he didn&#39;t even drop the god damn Rune.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill try again tonight, this time I&#39;m gonna get in a group with someone 30+<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan, who only needs the rune to get his Lambent Vambraces!!  8(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Crysarra de&#39;Danaan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucretia_71@...\">lucretia_71@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can tell you that I went to go kill them one night with a level 31<br/>\n&gt;ranger and my 29th druid and the ranger ended up dying (although I was<br/>\n&gt;not full mana and wasn&#39;t ready for the pull)...they are mean...conned<br/>\n&gt;yellow to me at 29.  If you can keep him from pounding on you too much<br/>\n&gt;you may be able to have the mage nuke him  but...at your level I would<br/>\n&gt;be really careful adn have an escape route planned....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
