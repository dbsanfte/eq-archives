I said that they weren&#39;t as<br/>\nprolific as you were implying.  I was in the magi room last night, as the<br/>\nonly snarer (the necro was our cleric, and the fights were relatively short,<br/>\nso he wasn&#39;t darknessing).  In three hours of nearly constant pulls, I got<br/>\n11 early breaks and 2 immediate breaks; these numbers are typical of what I<br/>\nexpect from blue mobs from past experience.  My Charisma has always been<br/>\nbetween 123 and 148 (currenly 133), if that has anything to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether or not the recent patch made that the breaks more frequent, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t attest to that, since my sample time was only 3 hours, and I could<br/>\nhave been getting lucky with the RNG.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
