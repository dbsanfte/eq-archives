It now bumps you back<br/>\nonto the shore.<br/>\nThe warp in Commonlands has also been fixed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was posted on Caster&#39;s Realm and from what I heard being shouted last<br/>\nnight it is apparently true.  Why is that Verant will go to any lengths<br/>\nseemingly to fix any bug which might cause an unintentional beneficial<br/>\neffect, yet totally ignore bugs which produce unintentional negative<br/>\neffects?  There are several zones where mobs warp all the time, most notably<br/>\nin my mind the semi newbie zone of Qeynos Hills.  Attacking things that flee<br/>\nin that zone is mind-numbingly difficult without Root as they will nearly<br/>\nalways run a short distance then warp to the road near the zone line.  When<br/>\nHolly gets trained to that spot the entire zone becomes her personal hunting<br/>\nground as every person who attacks a wolf that flees gets added to her hate<br/>\nlist while she is near that point.  Has Verant addressed this bug in any<br/>\nway?  No.  They sure will fix a warp that might do nothing more beneficial<br/>\nthan save someone some time.  Not that I really approve of using such a<br/>\nwarp, I don&#39;t.  I certainly don&#39;t approve of Verant&#39;s devil-may-care<br/>\nattitude towards warps that are not beneficial either.  They are equally<br/>\nridiculous, more disruptive of game atmosphere, and bigger causes of player<br/>\n(hence customer, least important person in Verant client-provider<br/>\nrelationship) discomfort.  Just ask anyone who&#39;s ever been to Mistmoore how<br/>\nthey feel about warping.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t work at Verant that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
