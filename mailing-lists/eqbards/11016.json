I got lucky and got the predator to drop the<br/>\nshard a few weeks ago.  I used it for 2 nights and now its collecting dust<br/>\nin the bank.  Its not only resisted a lot, forget about using it in Sol A,<br/>\nit&#39;s resisted damn near every time.  I am rather surprised about the stamina<br/>\nproblems that the initial poster of this thread mentioned.  The scimi/dirk<br/>\ncombo is the same setup I use, and I have yet to see my stamina drop more<br/>\nthan a bubble.  In fact, I often drop my dirk in my ranged slot and dual<br/>\nwield 2 OS&#39;s with very similar results stamina wise.  Maybe its the group<br/>\nmakeup I have, I imagine if you run in a caster heavy group, you would have<br/>\nthat problem when mana runs low.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>\nThe Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>\nThe Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>\nopinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>\nthought it could be hehe.
