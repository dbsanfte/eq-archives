There<br/>\nare camps in NRO that are usually camped out.  There is one rather large<br/>\ncamp that is in West Commons that is not always camped out because only<br/>\ngood groups or exceedingly high levels can handle it, but as soon as you<br/>\nget a group organized to crack it open, the vultures appear and expect<br/>\nyou to share it.  There are a couple more derv camps in SRO that I have<br/>\nfound to be much less busy, probably because a lot of people don&#39;t like<br/>\nto travel through Oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good loot is in the form of bronze weapons and cutthroat rings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLynn Uhlman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m a lvl 15 bard and i&#39;m looking for a great place to make a lot of<br/>\n&gt; cash, plus get some exp.
