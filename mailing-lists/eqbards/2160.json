They were campers).  So I memorized Jig and<br/>\nplayed it, mentioning how I thought it was supposed to increase regeneration<br/>\n%15.  The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower, he<br/>\n&quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>\nwanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>\nindeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>\nnasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby, and<br/>\nno accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they thought<br/>\nthey were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>\nirritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?  OO,<br/>\nthat&#39;s what got me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who was<br/>\nthe leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood our<br/>\nusefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>\nwith them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>\nexperiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards just<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>\nfinesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>\nhealth was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>\nirritated.<br/>\n<br/>\nEr, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone done<br/>\nany definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>\n&quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how they<br/>\nwork.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>\nThing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>\nreally enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.  (Memories of torturing lab<br/>\nrats!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have no way to get an instinctive feel for this!  DOES mana regenerate<br/>\nfaster with Jig or not?  Anyone really use a stopwatch with a buddy?  My<br/>\nfriends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>\ntesting.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>\nwas just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
