A power gamer is better off just buying a walrus skin drum but if you do quests, this is deffinately one not to miss out on.  <br/>\nThese were actually the toughest coins for me to get.  I went to Dalnirs and suffered many deaths (mostly because of bad pick up groups but I did meet some excellent players as well).  I went to Kaesora several times with guildmates and never saw a failed crypt raider.<br/>\nI paid 10pp for my Dalnir coin and 200pp for my Kaesora coin (I cringed but it was worth it).  I made four trips into Kaesora and never saw a failed crypt raider.  Both dungeons can be a tough place to hunt.  I recommend getting your guild involved as it&#39;s good to have friends around places like these.  <br/>\n  Katye and Brandon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landmax13@...\">landmax13@...</a>&gt; wrote: Got my 4th coin for the tambourine quest today in Emerald jungle.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo coins left... the kaesora coin and the dalnir coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate any stories/remembrances from anyone getting these <br/>\ncoins.
