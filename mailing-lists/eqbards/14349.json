Steelwolf, you are entitled to your<br/>\nopinion and so is Harmonic.  There is no need for this cursing and flaming<br/>\ngoing on from either of you.  In Harm&#39;s original post, his subject line even<br/>\nsaid it was a rant and off topic.  In the text prior to his rant he said, if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to read it, just delete it.  That should be good enough for<br/>\nall of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Harmonic, I understand that it is very hard to get personal attacks from<br/>\npeople, but it does no good to join in and start bashing as well.  It just<br/>\nperpetuates the cycle and everyone gets to look bad.  I honestly expect a<br/>\nlittle more from you.  You ( as well as some of the other prolific posters)<br/>\nare like the big brothers of the board.  The rest of us take our cue from<br/>\nyou on how to act.  If you start bringing it down to this level, the list is<br/>\ngonna degrade pretty fast.  That said, I really admire your contribution to<br/>\nthe list.  I hope I too can contribute when I am more accomplished as a<br/>\nbard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest of you, let&#39;s act like the adults I know most of you are and<br/>\nlet people have their say without condemning them and flaming them.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it, give your own opinion without making it a personal attack.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just your opinion after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean Daoine&#39;Sidhe, Bard of the 20th Song on E&#39;ci<br/>\n(Can you tell I am a Mom, in RL?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Wow, i&#39;m really impressed by Harmonic. He is a real font of wisdom,<br/>\n&gt;sending me an e-mail like this. So sad. now I guess I&#39;ll go cower in the<br/>\n&gt;corner because this ranting loon didn&#39;t like my post.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>\n&gt;&gt; intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Give me a f*cking break, don&#39;t ever post sh*t like that again.<br/>\n&gt;  If you have a problem with me address it to me.  I&#39;m growing<br/>\n&gt;  very tired of you Verant a**kissers.  That clear enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Use your power, and press the delete key, because you are the naive<br/>\n&gt;  one here buddy.  I for one don&#39;t give a sh*t about what you think<br/>\n&gt;  after that kind of bashing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  btw, have a nice day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
