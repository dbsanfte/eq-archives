Foremost, I<br/>\nguess it&#39;s their right to do what turns them on and gaining levels<br/>\napparently does - even at the cost of many hours of boredom.   To do it in<br/>\n17 days, I guess he did little else and what he did he was pretty good at.<br/>\nI was pretty low in 50 when Kunark released.  In the first week or so, I<br/>\nmade 51 but then have been stagnent (playing my secondaries mostly) but I<br/>\nguess I need to get going and make 52.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for uber-guilds, my guild has about 60 level 50&#39;s.  Some of them are able<br/>\nto be online most anytime of day, ie they are in college or in between r/l<br/>\njobs.  So, if the server resets and we feel like a dragon, we have a pretty<br/>\ngood chance of getting one. It was not always that way.  A few months ago,<br/>\nwe did not have enough ppl to mount a dragonn raid and we would take guests.<br/>\nWhen we finally had enough to do it all guild, we did not have enough 50&#39;s<br/>\nin enough planes gear to make it as easy as it is for us now. So, we got<br/>\nsmooshed few times and learned stuff.  But my point is, doing large guild,<br/>\nmulti-group things is no small effort.  All too often, you end up with 20+<br/>\nppl waiting for one person.  One time we sat for 2+ hours waiting for ppl to<br/>\nlogin for a planned plane raid and ended up cancelling it due to lack of the<br/>\nright ppl (ie not enough clerics or not enough tanks whatever.) So, when I<br/>\nhear that they are organized and ppl know where to go and what to do, that<br/>\ndon&#39;t sound all too bad to me - heh.  An over bearing, military style<br/>\nattitude oth does not sound too delitefull.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still end up doing dumb stuff.  My wiz broke camp in Gfay and heard some<br/>\nguy shouting for a loc of the brownie guards so he could get his corpse.<br/>\nHmm, this guy must be really lost (he&#39;s a level 8 gnome wizard.) So, I go to<br/>\nhelp him and we confirm no corpses in this zone and set out for Lesser Fay.<br/>\nWe hug the zone and see the brownie villiage. I invis us and he goes to get<br/>\nhis corpse.  Invis drops or he tried to loot it and he dropped it and they<br/>\nattack.  I try to gate us and he dies in 2 rounds and my wiz dies before the<br/>\nspell is done casting.  Sheesh.  My wiz gates back to gfay and I log Sylly<br/>\non the other PC. Then the gnome goes LD.  We wait 20 min and no gnome. So we<br/>\nset out and as we are about to zone, the gnome is back. So, we go back and<br/>\nget him and yada yada. Sylly ends up dragging the corpses to the gfay zone<br/>\nso they can loot in peace &lt;g&gt;.  Total waste of time - in fact a loss of xp<br/>\nfor my wiz but a great adventure and a happy little gnome (who wont be<br/>\nvisiting Lfay for 10 or 20 levels prolly &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is great fun in doing things &quot;first&quot; and we have some firsts in our<br/>\nguild on our server (Miriana&#39;s guild has lots more).  The relentless pursuit<br/>\nof being first is not all that apealling.  Finding some middle ground is in<br/>\nitself difficult.  What FoH is doing, seems to me to be the right thing for<br/>\n&quot;getting there first.&quot;  Powerlevel an A-team. Power up the rest.  Go to new<br/>\nzones when you are at the top of the food chain (as high a level as you can<br/>\nget) and have the best gear you can get.  But the way they do it may not be<br/>\nwhat everyone enjoys in terms of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 51 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.
