It definitely<br/>\n&gt;   doesn&#39;t feel like 3.0 seconds between swings.  They are some of the<br/>\n&gt;   fastest attackers (maybe perceptively) around since they theorectically<br/>\n&gt;   are of level where you will see possible quadruple attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, they can have speed buffs cast on them.  Dunno<br/>\nabout ice giants in particular, but last night I saw a gnoll<br/>\nenchanter buffing other gnolls.  The message was &quot;moves<br/>\nfaster&quot; which is the standard attack speed buff message.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the recent bug Verant found, you will only see triple<br/>\nand quad attacks if a mob is dual wielding weapons.  Sir Lucan<br/>\ntriple attacked me twice last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I can easily last twice to three times as long in toe to toe against<br/>\n&gt;   an ice giant with togors on it.  It would be obvious after chains<br/>\n&gt;   wore off (and didn&#39;t effect togors) if my survivability was still<br/>\n&gt;   intact.  Snakes don&#39;t offer such challenges, and you then need to<br/>\n&gt;   resort to logging and timing.  With larger npcs the dmg output will<br/>\n&gt;   be noticably different without parsing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Damage is by definition random and variable.  Your stopwatch<br/>\nis not (at least one would hope not :).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
