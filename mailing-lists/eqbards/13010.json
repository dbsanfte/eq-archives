One <br/>\nthe one side, there are the bards who play nothing but this in combat - I <br/>\nthink the people on this list have expressed pretty clearly why this is <br/>\n*usually* the sign of someone who doesn&#39;t understand how their other songs <br/>\nwork (obviously, in most cases our other songs are far more effective).  On <br/>\nthe other side, there are those who claim that, after hitting level 20, they <br/>\nnever use this song anymore, and more, look down upon those who do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night a group of my guildmates went frost giant hunting to get a mage <br/>\nsome toesies.  The group was 50 druid (puller), 47 mage (in search of <br/>\ntoesies), 37 cleric, 35 druid, 35 wizard, and of course the singin&#39; fool <br/>\nwith 37 more-or-less useful songs.  The mage whipped up a nasty pet, and <br/>\nawayyyy we went.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, short quiz: granted you&#39;re in a group with ONE primary tank (a pet) <br/>\nthat is not affected by your songs, and granted you have a target that&#39;s red <br/>\nto you, what would YOU do?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wove Celerity, Bellow, Bellow.  Yup, that&#39;s right.  The druids and wiz <br/>\nwere playing pingpong with the giant (we avoided melee as much as we could - <br/>\nthose guys hit HARD), and I let the druid snare so we could stay out of <br/>\nrange as much as possible.  I tried Fufil&#39;s but got a resist every time due <br/>\nto the dual-save.  I did run behind the giant, nipping at his heels with a <br/>\nborrowed yaksucker (which, btw, apparently DOES proc at 37 - on two <br/>\noccasions I got a message &quot;Your target has resisted the Ykesha spell&quot; and <br/>\nnever did I get the warning that I lacked the willpower to use that fine <br/>\nweapon ´┐¢ maybe I just have a lot of willpower for my level? = ) ).  Celerity <br/>\nhelped me get in a few more hits on him, so it was *maybe* as good as Bellow <br/>\n- maybe not.  Due to the pingponging, the giant was turning around a lot and <br/>\nI had a hard time keeping him in range of my melee attacks - even snared, <br/>\nthey have long legs, y&#39;know?  We killed about 10 giants, I think... and in <br/>\nthat time I had 2 resists from Bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed for a long time that Bellow has a very low resist rate - heck, <br/>\nI learned this as a teenager kiting red scythe beetles in North Karana.  I <br/>\nwas glad to see it still holds true 25 levels later.  My Bellows were <br/>\nusually hitting for 14 to 19 points of damage, which is not too bad, all <br/>\nthings considered.  My group was doing everything they could to lower his <br/>\nmagic resistance, but it still wasn&#39;t enough for me to get Fufil&#39;s to stick. <br/>\n  I didn&#39;t try Pixie Strike (wihch also lowers magic resist) because it has <br/>\nthe same dual-save problem Fufil&#39;s does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am always open to suggestions - so what would YOU do in this case?<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n~Flying Brethren~<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
