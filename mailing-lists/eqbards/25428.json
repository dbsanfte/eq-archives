They were<br/>\n&gt; advertised as also going over the haste cap, but<br/>\n&gt; tests have shown they<br/>\n&gt; do not.  They are 5% and 10% respectively (useless<br/>\n&gt; that small and<br/>\n&gt; without going over the haste cap), probably designed<br/>\n&gt; that way with the<br/>\n&gt; intent of being 10% and 20% with instruments, which<br/>\n&gt; they require rather<br/>\n&gt; than just being able to sing with the lesser stats. <br/>\n&gt; However as we all<br/>\n&gt; know, unfortunately instruments do not increase<br/>\n&gt; haste (or mana) on any<br/>\n&gt; of our songs, just stats like strength, agility,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 25, 2001 1:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not sure if they could do the stackable haste spells<br/>\n&gt; the way they<br/>\n&gt; currently<br/>\n&gt; work.
