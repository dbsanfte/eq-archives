This way I would be left<br/>\n&gt;alone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with<br/>\n&gt;something like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join<br/>\n&gt;them, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from<br/>\n&gt;the basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.
