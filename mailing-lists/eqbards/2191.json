Lately (L21), I&#39;ve found the<br/>\nproblem of me being the mob magnet has mostly gone away.  It<br/>\nstill happens in trains, but when we&#39;re fighting one mob, just<br/>\nabout any tank is able to keep it off me if I&#39;m doing Anthem,<br/>\nBellow, Bellow, or Anthem, Heal, Bellow.  I was in Cazic with<br/>\na rogue (22) and paladin (20 with SBH) and I actually had to<br/>\nthrow in Binding every now and then to get the mobs to attack<br/>\nme to better distribute the damage between us.  I use a Dirk<br/>\nand Barbed Whip btw, probably the two best damage ratio<br/>\nweapons around my level, so it&#39;s not like my weapons suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve watched people my level fight solo in many zones, and<br/>\nbards just are not capable of holding out against the same<br/>\nmobs the others are.  Paladins, rangers, shadowknights, mages,<br/>\ndruids, can just plain cream mobs that would send me running<br/>\nbefore I&#39;ve gotten them down much below half life.  Sure if<br/>\nlots of people are beating on a mob so that it&#39;ll die before<br/>\nyou do, you *might* be able to get the kill with Warsong,<br/>\nBellow, Bellow.  But we just don&#39;t have the hp/defense to stay<br/>\nthe long haul when soloing.  The strength of our class when<br/>\nsoloing is the short downtimes.  I sometimes exploit this when<br/>\nsoloing by fighting a mob to below half (with me down to under<br/>\ntwo bubbles), running and healing back to full, then stopping<br/>\nto finish off the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the bard is flexible enough that (I&#39;ve found up to L21)<br/>\nyou&#39;ll always be able to solo one way or another, but you will<br/>\ndo much much much better when grouped.  And the group will<br/>\nlove you because you endow them with your short downtime<br/>\nadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
