I have have<br/>\ntremendous success the past few weeks grouping with rogues in Kunark.  With<br/>\njust me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>\nand right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  There was a<br/>\nparty of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped with a rogue<br/>\nand we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me but not the<br/>\nrogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They decided against<br/>\nadding us both.  We showed them up by using chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>\nnext to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they did.  Since we<br/>\nhad little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs than they did.<br/>\nAnd since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say we ended up<br/>\ngetting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in refuses to add a<br/>\nrogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jamie Bedford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbedford@...\">bbedford@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 3:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you really rather have not had an entire evening of awesome grouping<br/>\nso that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?

As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit waiting for a<br/>\ngroup for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever waited was 4<br/>\nhours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ carreer, but have a<br/>\nlot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give up exp in a<br/>\nheartbeat.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
