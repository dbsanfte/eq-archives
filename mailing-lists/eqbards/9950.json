Setup near the backdoor of the place - least chance of<br/>\ngetting trained there.  I rocketed from 17th - 23rd while at Unrest.  A good<br/>\nplace from 25th - 28th is fighting Crag Spiders in Eastern Karana.  There is<br/>\na particular mountain (hill) next to an abandoned farmstead that is usually<br/>\ncrawling with the buggers - although their spawns seem to vary with time of<br/>\nday.  There have been a handful of occasions where I couldn&#39;t find any.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ULTIMATE place for a bard to solo (IMO) is the Fearie camp in Lesser<br/>\nFaydark.  It&#39;s INCREDIBLE exp and pretty good loot (Fine Steel galore,<br/>\ngemstones, words, runes, etc) from level 28th - 35th.  I&#39;ve soloed there<br/>\nalmost exclusively since level 28.  I made it from level 31 to 32 in about 7<br/>\nhours of playing.  What&#39;s really great about the place, is that it&#39;s a<br/>\nbard&#39;s paradise.  You get to play with so many tactics while fighting those<br/>\nguards and gearheart.  Charming, full instrument, fear / chain, pixie<br/>\nstrike, melee, etc, etc.  I&#39;ve hunted there with groups before, but I<br/>\nhonestly think this is one of those rare places / times when you can<br/>\nactually generate more loot and exp while solo.  This morning I made just a<br/>\nlittle under a bubble of EXP in about an 1 1/2 hours.  The trick is finding<br/>\nout which guards you can safely pull w/o pulling the entire camp.  Also,<br/>\nPrincess Joleena spawns from time to time and fights with her can be VERY<br/>\nscary (she roots and whirls A LOT).  In fact, I couldn&#39;t really win a fight<br/>\ninvolving her until I made 30th.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I cannot recommend this place enough for bards in the 28 - 33 level<br/>\nrange.  Unfortunately, this place is starting to attract more attention with<br/>\neach passing day.  I used to be able to hang-out there for hours on end<br/>\nwithout seeing another soul.  Recently, there&#39;s usually one or two other<br/>\ngroups working the camp (the spawn times are really quick so it&#39;s no big<br/>\ndeal).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 32 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: TommyC [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:uber_sorcerer@...\">uber_sorcerer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 12:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Where to go at low levels<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just want to start off by saying that this board has made <br/>\n&gt; my time as a young bard a real joy :-) keep up the good work.<br/>\n&gt; Now that I&#39;m 21st level and have a bit of padding&lt;1 /12 bub&gt; <br/>\n&gt; on the exp bar I would like to know where is a good place to <br/>\n&gt; hunt at my level for exp/loot I am now at LakeRathe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 0-5        Qeynos/qeynos hills<br/>\n&gt; 5-8        Qeynos sewers Thugs/smuggs/sharkes<br/>\n&gt; 8-12      BB Giant Snakes<br/>\n&gt; 12-16    Noble Isle A.K.A.
