You&#39;re viewing this as a<br/>\nclass envy issue, so to you the fact that it takes longer<br/>\nbetween songs is irrelevant (it&#39;s not, for the same why people<br/>\nhate hell levels).  All I&#39;m saying is that in recognition of<br/>\nthis change from standard levels, the designers seem to have<br/>\ntaken steps to &quot;soften the blow&quot; for other casting classes,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t forsee them doing anything for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to appraise classes differences from a game balance<br/>\nstandpoint (why I calculated mana-usage-rate comparisons for a<br/>\nshaman).  I don&#39;t appreciate my prediction (based on past<br/>\nbehavior) that bards will not be given the same amount of<br/>\nconsideration with the expansion being offhandedly labeled as<br/>\nclass envy.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
