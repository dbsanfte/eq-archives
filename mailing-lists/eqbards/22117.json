With DE illusion up and<br/>\nCarrilion, I can get my faction to amiable in the evil outpost, allowing me<br/>\nto bank and trade there.  However, I still died there over the weekend.  I<br/>\nwas turning in 4 sarnak war braids to the undead captain when I went<br/>\nlinkdead.  I knew I would be in trouble when I logged back in (why do<br/>\nillusions disappear when you go LD but standard buffs remain in effect?).<br/>\nAs soon as I logged in, I started heading for the countryside.  I got Selos<br/>\nup but realized I forgot to toggle Run.  So next thing I know the General<br/>\nand his dragoon goons were whipping up on me.  I might have lasted a total<br/>\nof 10 seconds from the time I logged in to the time I died.  Fortunatly I<br/>\ngot far enough away that I could get to my corpse with the invis song up and<br/>\nnot have to worry about getting close to the dragoons.  So lesson learned is<br/>\ndon&#39;t bank/trade in evil outpost if your connection is suspect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.
