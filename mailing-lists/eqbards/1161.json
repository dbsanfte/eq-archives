Also Befallen might get you some <br/>\nxp/loot, but I personally despise the place. It&#39;s really a cleric&#39;s dream <br/>\ncome true though i think. Guk might also have something for you, though i <br/>\nhaven&#39;t been there since beta4.<br/>\nNear Qeynos I&#39;d probably be in Blackburrow hunting gnoll guardsmen, elites, <br/>\nand commanders.<br/>\nNear Erudin you could try Kerra Isle.<br/>\nAlso some good hunting in the Karanas, just watch out for griffons, hill <br/>\ngiants, and cyclopses, among other things (seen werewolves in East Karana <br/>\nafter nightfall, they probably roam the other Karanas too).<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin, 10th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
