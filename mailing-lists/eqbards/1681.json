However, I<br/>\nhave come to the conclusion that the majority of people playing this game<br/>\nare not aware of the utility of the /assist command.  I always request<br/>\npeople in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>\nenemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>\nthe /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them what<br/>\nit does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could do<br/>\nthat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin<br/>\n\tE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
