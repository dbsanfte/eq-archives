Yes, Bards are <br/>\noutnumbered dramatically if you include EVERY OTHER CLASS in the <br/>\nopposing view.  But, so are ALL other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the TRUE side:  Only 8% would care about Wizards, 10% about <br/>\nDruids... BUT 93% care about PVE.  That&#39;s why the better comparison <br/>\nis looking at how close each is to the average.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume a server population of 2000.  If all classes were equal, you&#39;d <br/>\nexpect 143 of each class.  80 Bards are 56% of the average.  160 <br/>\nWizards are 112% of the Average.  200 Druids are 140% of the Average.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, assume a total EQ population of 100,000.  If all types of server <br/>\nwere equal, you&#39;d expect 50,000 of each class.  7,000 PVP players are <br/>\n14% of the Average.  93,000 PVE players are 186% of the Average.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all this is meaningless when you consider the original <br/>\nquestion.  EQ is not balanced or developed with a PVP mindset.  <br/>\nSongs, spells, and rules are altered to fit PVP, not designed for a <br/>\nPVP purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
