Here is the story of my first vist to Innothule Swamp:<br/>\n<br/>\nI zoned in from South Ro and walk around sight seeing.  At that time I was <br/>\nlv19 so everything is green to me.  I saw this froglok for the first time <br/>\nand it was conned dubious to me.  So I decided to kill one and see what kind <br/>\nof faction hit it will cause me.  Well, sure enough, after killing one, the <br/>\nrest are now threatening to me.  So I thought, well, I need to fix this.  So <br/>\nI run around a bit and look for a Troll or something to kill.  Well, I found <br/>\none.. a green Troll Slayer!  Yay, so I whack at her and expect her to die in <br/>\na few rounds.  Boy was I wrong!  She was beating the crap out of me!  (Later <br/>\nI found out that she is an NPC like Dorn who fight a lot harder than his <br/>\nlevel)  So anyway I was down to 2 bubbles and she had still over half <br/>\nhealth.  Time to run!  But wait.. I didn&#39;t know which way is the zone to <br/>\nSouth Ro!  So I just follow the wall, and as I turn a corner... there were <br/>\nthese whole tribe of Trolls!  I came to the entrance of Grobb!  But instead <br/>\nof turning back and face the Troll Slayer.. I just zone into Grobb with the <br/>\nspeed song.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily there is no guard inside the zoneline, so I healed and ready to get <br/>\nout.  But there were like a whole family of Trolls out there.. even if I run <br/>\nout they will still see me and I am not familiar with the swamp so I may not <br/>\nbe able to run to the zone before the Trolls cut me up in pieces.  Well, my <br/>\nonly hope at that time was that the Invis song will work on them!  So I <br/>\nfired it up and sure enough, I walked out of Grobb unharmed! =)  So that&#39;s <br/>\nmy story of my only visit to Grobb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone ever tried sneaking into an evil city using Sonorous Clouding?? <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;know there really isn&#39;t much reason to do this except for maybe the<br/>\n&gt;excitemnt =) Just wondering<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\n&gt;Bard of Kelethin of the 15th Chorus<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
