Sprit Callers Pets<br/>\ncould not touch me. I just kept mixing it in with VOV and dropped out<br/>\nNIV&#39;s ( right, Niv&#39;s does not stack with Shield ) for 51 Largo&#39;s. But by<br/>\nthe time I keep the Mana song, run song, and heal song, I have only one<br/>\nslot left for crowd control. That means no shield songs or any choice<br/>\nbetween Mez and Charm..<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sigh<br/>\n<br/>\n Moonflower Bllue of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n Still looking for Dragon Drops :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
