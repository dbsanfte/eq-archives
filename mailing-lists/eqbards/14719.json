What songs are you talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in Guk without an enchanter, you are probably the person who will<br/>\nneed to do crowd control.  So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>\nmob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>\nwant to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>\ndoes not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>\ncelerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>\na situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.  And<br/>\nplaying area effect damage songs is not the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 45 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: joseph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmounts@...\">jmounts@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note, I&#39;ve always been scared to death to play any area songs in<br/>\n&gt; lower guk.
