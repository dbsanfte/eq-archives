Our strategy was simple.  He would root <br/>\nand I would stand back and sing Fulfils, Chant of Flame, and Chant of <br/>\nFrost.  Never once did a creature break root because of the damage on <br/>\nthese songs.  The cleric even commented how nice it was that his root <br/>\nwas lasting for full durations.  We fought in Burning Wood, the Mines <br/>\nof Nurga, and Frontier Mountains.  A wide variety of creatures.  Our <br/>\ntoughest battle was against a Wurm in Burning Wood.  The Wurm <br/>\nresisted a root and did seem to break a few early.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Cristi, Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel P.
