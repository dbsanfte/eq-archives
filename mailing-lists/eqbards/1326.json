She<br/>\nis constantly SoC (Spirit of Cheetah) and she will easily outrun a bard with<br/>\na drum.  Also Captain Shralok in Kithicor Forest can keep up with the sung<br/>\nversion of Accelerando.  Just curious, has anyone discovered whether or not<br/>\naccelerando&#39;s speed increases with levels?  I am lv 24, and I havent really<br/>\nnoticed any difference, but then i use the song much every level and i<br/>\ncouldnt really tell even if there was a difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKa`Lend, 24th Wood Elven Bard of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Warning about Accelerando<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are mobs that can keep up with you with Accelerando<br/>\n*with* a drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know each week we feature a ONElist story?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?
