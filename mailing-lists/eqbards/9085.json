I had never<br/>\nexperienced it before, but it seems since the last patch, things have been<br/>\n&quot;warping&quot; out of range all the time.  I&#39;ve noticed this in the Karanas,<br/>\nOasis, and even in Solusek B last night.  New bug?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 48 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n- The pathing and warping in the zone is VERY bad.  You&#39;ll be fighting a<br/>\ngiant and suddenly<br/>\n  it&#39;s just GONE.  Sometimes it warps just a short distance, which is no big<br/>\ndeal,<br/>\n  he&#39;ll come running after you quickly enough.  The real danger is when they<br/>\nwarp a long<br/>\n  distance away, and then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen<br/>\nto walk<br/>\n  near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant friends and the<br/>\nlittle cyclops<br/>\n  who wants to be part of the group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
