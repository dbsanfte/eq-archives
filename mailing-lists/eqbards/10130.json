LOL!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 32nd with maxed 1HB and maxed 1HS, a Staff of Writhing and a Silvery War<br/>\n&gt;Axe I can kill a light blue if nothing abnormal happens and he&#39;s not a<br/>\n&gt;caster.  Taking on a blue or deep blue would be tantamount to suicide, at<br/>\n&gt;best very, very risky.  For me a solid blue mob would be a Lizard Fanatic <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule.  It would pound me into the mud one-on-one.  No question.  On<br/>\n&gt;the other hand, a light blue would be a gator in the sewers.  I *can* solo<br/>\n&gt;one of those.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So you know how I chose to kill a Fan?  I group and play Hymn, Anthem,<br/>\n&gt;Binding, Clarity, Pixie Strike, Lullaby, etc.  People like to have me in a<br/>\n&gt;group because of all the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; stuff that I/we do.  No<br/>\n&gt;enchanter? - Pixie Strike that Herald while the meleers in the group kill<br/>\n&gt;the Page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To kill a solid blue mob a 35th bard would have to do a bit more than &quot;kite<br/>\n&gt;a little&quot; to be comfortable.  They&#39;d have to GROUP.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ya bards can not solo a blue, but they can duo a blue &lt;grin&gt;.
