I learned this a long time ago with my ranger.<br/>\nIf I slap flame lick on a mob and it is glued to you. (flame lick is an ac<br/>\ndebuf and a minor dot)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have learned is that proximity is a huge factor in so far as<br/>\nagro is concerned. If you stand just at the edge of melee you&#39;ll see much<br/>\nless attention than if you are right under the mob. A good bard can<br/>\nmanipulate this both ways. I can often &quot;taunt&quot; off of my groups warrior just<br/>\nby stepping up to the mob. At the same time I can allow him to taunt off me<br/>\nby stepping back a few paces.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 23, 2000 9:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] DOTs at 39<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an eye opening grouping experience yesterday, I&#39;d just like to share<br/>\nit and get the more experienced bards comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group:<br/>\nElfson Allegro Lvl 39 half Bard (and a damn handsome man)<br/>\n41 Ranger<br/>\n35 Enchanter<br/>\n38? Druid<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason they wanted to group in the dreadlands (3 of these were<br/>\nguildies and the 4th was a friend).  I said we&#39;re probably over matched<br/>\nthere and won&#39;t do very well.  But they wanted to try it, so I agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decide to go full DOT mode since I figured our only shot was to kill these<br/>\nsuckers fast. (and I wanted to see if my damage calculations were close to<br/>\ncorrect).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat came as a total shock to me was that the ranger (augmented/buffed,<br/>\nwielding a yak and some weird spear/staff which he says is better off hand<br/>\nweapon than yak) was unable to keep the monsters from agroing on me.  I sung<br/>\n2 chants and Denon&#39;s using Nostrolo Tamborine and a normal horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it possible that I was outdamaging him?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was then I am pretty excited about this song combo.  Granted I can&#39;t<br/>\nuse Denon&#39;s in a dungeon (AOE damage bad!), but that could be replaced with<br/>\nan number of songs (I often use Melodic Binding in a multi pull dungeon<br/>\nsituation, the enchanters are quite grateful when the mobs that break mez<br/>\ncome running for me rather than them).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case with those 4 (low level for dreadlands) people we were able to<br/>\npull pretty much non stop, with the Ranger pulling anything but Ravishing<br/>\nDrolvogs (Those football players hit HARD).  Needless to say the xp was<br/>\namazing (for an outdoor pull), I got like 1.5 of 39 in about 2 hours...  I<br/>\nhavent seen xp like that since I was doing the lvl 18-2? solo DOT attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course at the end (&quot;last pull for me guys!&quot;) the new dragon was trained<br/>\nto Karnor&#39;s and I got killed in his breath weapon (while getting a screen<br/>\nshot!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
