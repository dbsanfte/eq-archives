I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban from<br/>\nthe Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with almost<br/>\nno weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I can<br/>\nstart saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 18th human bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 07, 1999 1:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Help I look like a Nazi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyone noticed almost every helm in the game is ugly?

They should get a special rare<br/>\nattack where they impale their victim&#39;s on their horns.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarven plate helms are good too, little spikey things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE half-elven plate helms, they are very Flash Gordon. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWood elven males look great I think, I realize the little wings might not be<br/>\nmacho, but it is surely better than the girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark elves of course has that hideous skull thing going, which although<br/>\nugly, I think looks GREAT and is very befitting of their class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalflings and gnomes in plate end up looking like a little tin can, but<br/>\nstill neat looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLowest ranking helm looks are humans, and wood elven girls. They both look<br/>\nlike a pencil eraser. Wood elven girls look like a trash can with Spock<br/>\nears. Just really bad. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia d&#39;Allaney<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
