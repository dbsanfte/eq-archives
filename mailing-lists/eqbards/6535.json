Net effect is that<br/>\nDDD/CoD/Hymn take longer to kill something, but you can<br/>\nsurvive a lot longer because of your increased hp regeneration<br/>\nrate.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhanex is a necro - a caster.  Using instruments can backfire<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re fighting a caster because the best strategy when<br/>\nfighting a caster is to kill him as quickly as possible.  <br/>\nWhereas against a melee mob your increased rate of hp<br/>\nregeneration using DDD/CoD/Hymn was enough to significantly<br/>\noffset the additional damage you took, against a caster it<br/>\nmakes a smaller difference.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. Say you&#39;re fighting a mob with 120 hp.  Say it&#39;s a melee<br/>\nmob and you&#39;re taking 10 damage/sec (numbers made up to<br/>\nillustrate the point).<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting with weapons you&#39;re doing damage at 6 dam/sec, so it<br/>\ntakes you 20 seconds to kill him.  You&#39;re healing at 4 hp/sec,<br/>\nso the net damage you take is (10-4) = 6 dam/sec.  Over 20 sec<br/>\nyou take 120 points of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting with instruments, you&#39;re doing damage at 4 dam/sec,<br/>\nso it takes you 30 seconds to kill him.  You&#39;re healing at 8<br/>\nhp/sec however, so the net damage you take is (10-8) = 2<br/>\ndamage/sec.  Over 30 sec you take 60 points of damage.<br/>\nInstruments work better than weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow say you&#39;re fighting a casting mob, again with 120 hp but<br/>\nthis time it does 25 damage/sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting with weapons it still takes you 20 seconds to kill<br/>\nhim.  The net damage you take is (25-4) = 21 dam/sec.  Over 20<br/>\nsec you take 420 points of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting with instruments it still takes you 30 seconds to<br/>\nkill him.  The net damage you take is (25-8) = 17 dam/sec.<br/>\nOver 30 seconds you take 510 points of damage.  Weapons work<br/>\nbetter than instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary:<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee mob with weapons = 120 points damage taken<br/>\nMelee mob with instruments = 60 points damage taken<br/>\n<br/>\nCasting mob with weapons = 420 points damage taken<br/>\nCasting mob with instruments = 510 points damage taken<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that was understandable.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
