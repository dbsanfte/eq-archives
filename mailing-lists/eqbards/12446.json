I&#39;ve been on about 15-20<br/>\ndragon raids now, and we can fairly reliably kill the big suckers with 24<br/>\npeople now.  Often without any casualties.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn lag, I agree here.  Dragons seem to cause a lot of lag, I assume because<br/>\nof their size, but I don&#39;t really know.  I find it extremely difficult to<br/>\ntwist 2 songs here, so tend to stick to just one.  I&#39;ll use Elemental<br/>\nRhythems with  a MM drum.  I&#39;ve tried twisting Elemental and Guardian, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve found rather than risk one of them dropping, its best just to stick<br/>\nwith Elemental.  If your lag is good enough that you can twist 2, go for it.<br/>\nI&#39;m jealous.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the kicker, and I can&#39;t stress this enough.  Fire/Cold resists are<br/>\nEVERYTHING.  If you&#39;ve got a base resist of 25, you&#39;re not even allowed to<br/>\ncome becuase you&#39;ll be more of a liability than an asset.  Standing rule is<br/>\nto have a FR/CR base of at least 80 UNBUFFED.  With resist cold/fire and<br/>\nbard song on top of this, you should have something in the range of 180<br/>\nCR/FR.  Even this isn&#39;t great.  Over 200 is better.  I&#39;m currently in the<br/>\n220 range, and I&#39;m shooting for 255.  Its true that you&#39;ll still be taking<br/>\nalmost full damage at 125 resist.  People see this and say &quot;resists don&#39;t<br/>\nmatter&quot; but they can&#39;t be more wrong.  Low resists don&#39;t matter.  High<br/>\nresists are the difference between a successful dragon raid and a 2 hour<br/>\ncorpse recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nA buffed Magic Resist of 150 at level 50 has been enough to resist every<br/>\nsingle fear thrown against us.  I have NEVER been feared with a MR in this<br/>\nrange.  Since we can achieve this 150 with only Elemental playing, there&#39;s<br/>\nnot a real need for me to twist in a second song anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bit of a hot topic for me.  Currently my guild (and our allies)<br/>\nare the only people on our server that can reliable take down a dragon.  We<br/>\ndon&#39;t keep secrets.  We try to explain to other people what needs to be done<br/>\nto make one of these events successful.  Yet still people show up saying<br/>\n&quot;anyone got any extra resist gear?&quot; or &quot;is 40 resist high enough?&quot;  These<br/>\npeople, without fail, time after time, are the first to die.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 50 Bard, Erollisi Marr (youngest server to ever kill Nagafen)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 5:31 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Nagafen 2; Sylly 0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lord Nagafen graced us with his presence.

Here&#39;s why from<br/>\n  my limited experience in both planes, and inside info from<br/>\n  other servers dragon raids:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) Lag.  You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>\n     With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with all options<br/>\n     off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your misses,<br/>\n     your hits, all spell, all song, I still got lagged something<br/>\n     horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to update 30 people<br/>\n     in a very tight area, nothing you can do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) You will get more attention than you wanted, starting and stopping<br/>\n     a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so as it tripled me<br/>\n     for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted and he clobbered<br/>\n     me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta twist, so twist<br/>\n     the right stuff ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) Ok, so you are gonna lag and get beat up a little.  You still<br/>\n     need to twist.  Here&#39;s the kicker.  Your COLD/HEAT bonus from<br/>\n     those songs doesn&#39;t do much.  AE Breath will hit for normal if<br/>\n     your resistance is 25 or 125.  Take it for what it&#39;s worth,<br/>\n     and you may not believe it, but it&#39;s confirmed.  Now, you may partial<br/>\n     resist the dmg, but it&#39;s barely accountable to the resist level.<br/>\n     The biggest single problem is the AE fear when doing dragons.  <br/>\n     The best save vs. that fear is being L50... a fear on you even <br/>\n     with MR over 200 at L40 will stick.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4) Your damage counts.  I&#39;ve seen so many people say, Argh!  He<br/>\n     only had a sliver left.  Think if you added your 400 - 500 dmg<br/>\n     into the attack?  You&#39;ve got weapons, use em!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Oh wait... hehe, L41 is mystic shielding.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant was smart in this way, they gave you a song that boosts<br/>\n  MR by 60 (at L50) without using instruments or twisting songs.<br/>\n  Verses of Victory is amazing... ac20, str30, dex30, atkspeed inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I never went on dragon trips because you need the right people<br/>\n  for the job.  Extra people or wrong people just clutter up the <br/>\n  scenery and lag everyone.  Back in the day we only had like 40<br/>\n  L50&#39;s, now we have over 200.  It&#39;s just a matter of picking and<br/>\n  choosing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  No disrespect, cause I love ya a lot girl, but L40 bards aren&#39;t<br/>\n  cut out for dragon raids, unless the server is scrapped for people<br/>\n  at the time of the raid.  Simply because the songs you really<br/>\n  need are higher up, and the level difference really hurts your<br/>\n  DragonFear resist and ability to strike the monster.  As much <br/>\n  as I wanted to go to do them in the past, I had to defer the<br/>\n  work to someone more experienced.  Which is exactly what I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power (L50) again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
