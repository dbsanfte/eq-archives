(It probably all dates back to that bard who ridiculed me for<br/>\nusing the all-song combo when I was 22 and she was 28 because she &quot;didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it&quot;...her combo of choice was hymn, chains and anthem with weapons.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, your posts are making me seriously consider making another bard on my<br/>\nserver (or another one, I don&#39;t care) and working him up to crags again :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, my beloved ogre warrior is now 19 and desperately seeking<br/>\nhis surname.
