But it seems the other big guilds don&#39;t  have<br/>\nmuch of a problem with FOH, and they seemed to have come up with a<br/>\npretty good system of sharing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what i know, guild XXXX lets FOH know they want to kill yyyyyy (or<br/>\ninvade plane zzzzz), FOH gives them 24 hours (after it spawns) to do it,<br/>\nif not they go in and do it.  It sounds pretty reasonable to me as they<br/>\nreall have enough firepower to easily do both dragons after a respawn,<br/>\nbefore any other guild gets organized enough to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome guild got angry the FOH wouldn&#39;t share their techniques for<br/>\nbreaking the planes or killing the dragons easily (when these things<br/>\nweren&#39;t commonly known), but I don&#39;t have a problem with that.  I think<br/>\nthey have a right to keep those &quot;secrets&quot; to themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nVeeshan is a weird server, it has a VERY high percentage of Japanese<br/>\nplayers, so that always makes things a little testy (since there is<br/>\nbasically no communication).  Population wise (especially pre-split) it<br/>\nwas truly bizarre.  Veeshan would be 20% more crowded than any server in<br/>\nthe middle of night, early morning (Eastern time), but in prime time<br/>\n(Easterern still) it would be around average.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; we get the same thing on our server, as i am sure every &quot;uber-guild&quot; (stupid<br/>\n&gt; term) does on their respective servers.  i don&#39;t think anyone is quite as<br/>\n&gt; large or has quite the attitude that FoH apparently does though.  i think<br/>\n&gt; they have 300 or so members, so they can really take over a large portion of<br/>\n&gt; the high level game from other players.  we have about 65 members or so, and<br/>\n&gt; we can do dragons and planes at our leisure as well, but we work very well<br/>\n&gt; with the other guilds on the server capable of doing these.  i don&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt; that is the case with FoH.  i have no first-hand experience but from what i<br/>\n&gt; hear they deserve their rep, but i guess only those who have dealt with them<br/>\n&gt; personally can know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ok bragging time, we killed Venril Sathir first =b<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
