The Pickpocket skill is so misunderstood it is not even funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I will never understand why anyone would refuse to add a rogue to a group.<br/>\n&gt; The only legitimate reason I can think of is if they aleady have enough<br/>\n&gt; tanks and need a healer or a nuker to balance out the group.  I have have<br/>\n&gt; tremendous success the past few weeks grouping with rogues in Kunark.  With<br/>\n&gt; just me and a rogue we can chain/fear or instill doubt/backstab mobs left<br/>\n&gt; and right.  Most recent example was in the Overthere zone.  There was a<br/>\n&gt; party of four pulling to the FM zone.  I was already grouped with a rogue<br/>\n&gt; and we asked to join the party.  They were willing to add me but not the<br/>\n&gt; rogue.  I told them either both of us or none of us.  They decided against<br/>\n&gt; adding us both.  We showed them up by using chains/fear/backstab right there<br/>\n&gt; next to them.  We pulled and killed just as many mobs as they did.  Since we<br/>\n&gt; had little downtime, theres a good chance we killed more mobs than they did.<br/>\n&gt; And since there was just two of us, I think its safe to say we ended up<br/>\n&gt; getting more EXP than they did.  Anytime a group I&#39;m in refuses to add a<br/>\n&gt; rogue, I&#39;ll drop from the group and join him myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jamie Bedford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbedford@...\">bbedford@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 12, 2000 3:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you really rather have not had an entire evening of awesome grouping<br/>\n&gt; so that you wouldn&#39;t lose a little experience?  Treasure your lower levels<br/>\n&gt; while you still can.  As my level 48 rogue, I often just sit waiting for a<br/>\n&gt; group for hours on end (not kidding here, longest I&#39;ve ever waited was 4<br/>\n&gt; hours).  If I could stay level 48 for the rest of my EQ carreer, but have a<br/>\n&gt; lot of fun and always be grouped in the process, I would give up exp in a<br/>\n&gt; heartbeat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
