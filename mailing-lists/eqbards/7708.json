If you cant live without the bind spell, then a <br/>\n&gt;bard, warrior, ranger, shadowknight, paladin, rogue is <br/>\n&gt;properly not your kind of class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great, just what we need a bunch of pansy wizards and wimpy<br/>\ndruids running around.  By making a comment like the one <br/>\nabove, you alienate 50% of the players of the game.  This<br/>\nis not the intention on a company who would like to make<br/>\nmoney.

Gain some levels and <br/>\ngraduate from Blackburrow.  We had to Succor to North Karana<br/>\n3 f&#39;ing times the other night.  It&#39;s a MINIMUM 10 min run<br/>\nback to Permafrost.  But the casters just personal gated <br/>\nright back into the action.  It doesn&#39;t always have to do<br/>\nwith corpse recovery.  I was bound in Halas, and _still_ had<br/>\na long walk ahead of me.   I am the fasting moving thing in <br/>\nNorrath save two things, bards higher than me and SoN.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s completely idiotic that I cannot be bound anywhere a <br/>\ncaster will bind me.  You don&#39;t need a popup box, because<br/>\nyou already have to be in a group with the person.  How can<br/>\nsomeone maliciously bind me unless I group with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of running from Arena to Guk, and running from <br/>\nNorth Karana to Permafrost when all my other group members<br/>\nare either 1) waiting for us melee folk  2) blasting up <br/>\nmonsters left and right, gaining exp/loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt ruins my night.
