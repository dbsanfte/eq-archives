These","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-420225560\">I&#39;m glad your experience in Mistmoore has been better than mine.  I&#39;ve gone<br/>\nfrom 21 to 22, back to 21, gained 22, and now back to 21st level again.<br/>\nThese deaths have been primarily due to one or two jerks purposely causing<br/>\nmassive trains.  The most recent time my group was camping in the graveyard.<br/>\nWe had a party of 5 people all in their low 20s.  We were doing OK with what<br/>\nwe had.  A 30th level necromancer asked to join us.  Our group leader told<br/>\nhim no because of his level.  Next thing we know the necro is leading a<br/>\ntrain of ancilles and gargoyles into the graveyard.  As soon as he got to<br/>\nthe graveyard, he gated out.  They promptly killed me and one other person.<br/>\nThe other three were able to gate out.      <br/>\n<br/>\nNext time I log on I&#39;m going back to Unrest.  At my level, almost everything<br/>\nin Mistmoore except the familiars and sentrys were resisting my songs.  In<br/>\nUnrest I think I will be a little more useful.  Will probably head back to<br/>\nMistmoore when I&#39;m around 25th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer your original question, the posts I have read indicate the Lute of<br/>\nthe Gypsy Princess does not confer any bonuses to songs that use the String<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; BTW, experience in Mistmoore has been WONDERFUL to me.  Even after all the<br/>\n&gt; deaths (it&#39;s a VERY dangerous zone, heh) I&#39;ve gone from 22 to a hair from<br/>\n&gt; 25<br/>\n&gt; in no time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
