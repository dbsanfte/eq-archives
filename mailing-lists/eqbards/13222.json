Here&#39;s why:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Time is money.  Time is experience.  If I am bound 5 seconds away from my<br/>\n&gt;current position, I can fight a lot more riskier and gain a lot more xp than<br/>\n&gt;if I am bound 10 minutes away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is only true if you don&#39;t die, as exp loss from a single death will wipe<br/>\nout many kills.  I usually lose 1/2 hour to an hour&#39;s worth of exp from a death.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t die, then you didn&#39;t need the bind anyway, so you could have killed<br/>\nthe same amount of stuff with, or without it.  If you DO die, then saving that<br/>\n10 minutes isn&#39;t going to let you get back that lost exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Bind will get you, is letting you play for that 10 minutes, rather than<br/>\nrun.  But the exp loss will be the same.  The amount of exp you can get in 10<br/>\nminutes is a tiny, tiny fraction of what you lose by dying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Our songs do not FORCE us to attract attention.  Bellow all the way.  Save<br/>\n&gt;the healing song for downtime reduction.  It can be done if your current<br/>\n&gt;group is not adequate to protect you from harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are correct that you can play without singing AOE songs.  However, since<br/>\nthat limits you to  5 percent of our songlist, it stops you from being a Bard.<br/>\nTo limit yourself to Bellow and Warsong in a group makes you a dual wielding<br/>\nenchanter/cleric/shaman who has decided to &#39;tank&#39;.  Very unproductive.  Doing<br/>\nthat, you&#39;ve stopped being a Bard.  I don&#39;t think a good solution is to say,<br/>\njust don&#39;t play songs...  I doubt that a mob with 5K worth of hps cares much<br/>\nabout my 15 points of bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, no group can protect you if you are doing your job, buffing and healing<br/>\nand whatnot.  The tanks can get the attention of the target mob, but all others<br/>\nwill be on you.  The only protection you can get is to have your enchanter AOE<br/>\nMez all of the time, and that still prevents you from DoT&#39;ing, Lullabye&#39;ing,<br/>\netc.  I don&#39;t think a good solution for this is to stop using the songs that<br/>\ndefine our class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind the dying, I mind not playing as much because I run back so much<br/>\nmore often than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When a warrior dies, he has no sow, he has no invisibility, he has no summon<br/>\n&gt;corpse spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is true. But, to compensate he dies much less often than a Bard does.  If<br/>\nyou recall my original post, I say that adding Parry would move us from the<br/>\nCaster class to a true Hybrid class.  That would mean that we should not get<br/>\nbind, as we have the defensive powers of a melee class.  There&#39;s a reason that<br/>\nthe casters get bind and a warrior doesn&#39;t.  We&#39;re just on the wrong side of<br/>\nthat classification.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Bards aren&#39;t that bad off, at all.  Bards are the best non-binder at getting<br/>\n&gt;to the corpse and returning to a safe point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very true, in both cases.  We are a fine class, and I think not<br/>\nunderpowered at all.  We are also great at safely returning.  However, none of<br/>\nus can return to our bodies instantly.  We lose time no matter what, during that<br/>\nrun.  Since we die the most often, we lose the most time.  Make us die less with<br/>\nadded defensive skills, or reduce our running time with Bind.  But one or the<br/>\nother needs to be done to make our downtime the same as the other 13 classes in<br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I&#39;ve heard some say that using a 29th or higher cleric to res you is the<br/>\nanswer.  But really, if that were true, nobody at all should get bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias&#39; Mantra!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo power increases, no gate.  No reduction of deaths, which result in more exp<br/>\nloss than others.  Just bind to let us play the same amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
