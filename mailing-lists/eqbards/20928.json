What they get doesn&#39;t affect<br/>\nme. I honestly wouldn&#39;t use the mana boost anyway. Like it was originally<br/>\nsaid, the only time I&#39;m OOM is after a res. (of course having an enchanter<br/>\nin my regular group means I don&#39;t have to charm all that much)<br/>\n<br/>\nExp penalty: Luck of the draw. We deserve the penalty. Not because we are a<br/>\nhybrid of 2 classes. We deserve it because we have many abilities and to<br/>\noffset the sheer number we need to have an exp penalty. The penalty has<br/>\nnothing to do with parent classes, it has to do with having more ability<br/>\nthan one of the pure classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers can track and they get spells. This means they have more abilities<br/>\nthan the pure class of warrior, so they get an exp modifier.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins can LoH and get spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSks get HT and spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get tracking, songs, we can cast while moving (HUGE) so we get a<br/>\nmodifier. Makes perfect sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for broken songs, if we can find that original post of abashi&#39;s where<br/>\nhe admits the problems and announces an intended patch, then we can use that<br/>\nas fuel on our fire and force the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Mann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 10, 2000 12:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Oh this can&#39;t be good....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it&#39;s not so much that I&#39;m getting an exp penalty as it is that VI is<br/>\nusing it against us.<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nVI: &quot;All hybrids get a mana boost&quot; (and honestly, I could care less about<br/>\nmore mana)<br/>\nBards: &quot;Where is our mana boost?&quot;<br/>\nVI: &quot;You are not hybrids&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVI: &quot;All hybrids have an exp penalty&quot;<br/>\nBards: &quot;Why do we have it?&quot;<br/>\nVI: &quot;You are hybrids&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDOH!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of my favorites is<br/>\nVI: &quot;No, mana for bards isn&#39;t really mana usage, but a timer to stem off<br/>\npossible exploits&quot;<br/>\nBards: &quot;Well, since it&#39;s just a timer and we don&#39;t have any way to regen<br/>\nmana faster, what about the death penalty?&quot;<br/>\nVI: &quot;Tough s***&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big problem I have with Abashi&#39;s post is that he himself admitted<br/>\nthat there was &quot;an in advertant nerf&quot; to Chains when they lowered the rate<br/>\non the lvl 54 song.  He then stated that a patch would follow to fix it.<br/>\nThis is the first that has been mentioned since then.  I guess our patch was<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not broken&quot;.<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not even going to get into Lullaby or the fact that a literal wave<br/>\nof song ideas were posted months ago for the level 49 song, and we have been<br/>\ngiven no word yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nDisgruntled Bard of 39 Seasons<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

It&#39;s<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; valid arguement for changing the way that group experience is shared.  It<br/>\n&gt; should be based on level, not on total xp gained.  The reason it was set<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; the way it is was that Verant felt, and I tend to agree with them, that<br/>\n&gt; friends would be grouping alot and would want to level at the same rate so<br/>\n&gt; they divided xp the way they did so that friends would level at around the<br/>\n&gt; same rate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This worked, but the problem is that most people do not, in fact, group<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; their &#39;friends&#39; regularly and thus groups of strangers are penalized for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; hybrid&#39;s experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately experience sharing is embedded deeply into the client and<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure if Verant is willing to totally re-write the game engine to fix<br/>\n&gt; something that was put in intentionally.  I&#39;m not sure I would expect them<br/>\n&gt; to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.  If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is<br/>\nslower<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be your penalty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
