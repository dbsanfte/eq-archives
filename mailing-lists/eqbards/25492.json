Someone else looking at DAoC?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had fun as well.  Played a Paladin in beta but didnt get <br/>\n&gt; over level 6.  I<br/>\n&gt; had fun running around and exploring though.  It was really <br/>\n&gt; hard for me to<br/>\n&gt; move around at first.  EQ was my first real game and so using <br/>\n&gt; the keyboard<br/>\n&gt; was tough and it took me a long time to realize it worked <br/>\n&gt; better in third<br/>\n&gt; person in DAoC.  I think you can remap the buttons though.  I <br/>\n&gt; especially<br/>\n&gt; despised the using the right mouse button to move forward.  I <br/>\n&gt; was like all<br/>\n&gt; spazzing out and falling into the moat and stuff.  I really <br/>\n&gt; liked how the<br/>\n&gt; newbie mobs are really small and the things get bigger as you <br/>\n&gt; go, that was<br/>\n&gt; fun.  I think I will play it but am not sure.. maybe between <br/>\n&gt; now and when<br/>\n&gt; Luclin comes out?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a side note, my guild killed the 4th warder last night!!! <br/>\n&gt; Quite a moment<br/>\n&gt; of excitement, although for some reason some of the people in <br/>\n&gt; our guild were<br/>\n&gt; moving the sleeper around.  (If you didnt know, you can hit <br/>\n&gt; him and &quot;move&quot;<br/>\n&gt; him even though he isnt alive).  Anyway, he fell into the <br/>\n&gt; water and for some<br/>\n&gt; reason teh GMs say that caused the script not to run so now <br/>\n&gt; we have to DO IT<br/>\n&gt; ALL OVER AGAIN TONIGHT.  I hope we can!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Halana 60th Shaman<br/>\n&gt; Tani 56th Bard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 7:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Hmmm. Someone else looking at DAoC?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; First off, the newbie levels are IMO just like EQ with the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; small difference<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that solo is easier and corpse recovery is non existent. I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually let my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; self get killed to get back to town instead of running <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *shrug* There was no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death penalty..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I felt that the mobs where more &quot;stupid&quot; than in EQ. Even <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hobgoblins dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assist eachother when youre alone against them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *shrug* <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also miss newbie dungeons. All battle at lower levels is in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the open. My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overall impression was the there really wasent many <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dungeons.. Hope they add<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some nice ones ala Crushbone, BlackBurrow, Befallen etc.. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dungeon fighting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is fun :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also like the prospect of getting into some serius PvP <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Something i havent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; done since the days of Meridian 59 *grin*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Musiker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:despyzer@...\">despyzer@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:despyzer@...\">despyzer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *Snipped some*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  The three <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biggest improvements I think they have made are: (1) Quests: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have some sort of questing journal that helps you keep track <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of all of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quests you have taken part in and remind you what the next <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; step is that you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need to take. This includes picking up a drop from a mob that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is part of a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quest. No more spamming a zone asking if anyone knows what <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Raw Sword is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for or something like that. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aye the /quest command is soooeeee nice....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, the quests are supposed to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; change for each <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; character so they are level specific. No more high levels <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; camping low level <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quests for no experience. (2) Travel: I guess there are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; horses that you can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rent from NPCs which run you from stable to stable at a very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fast rate. You <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can jump off at any time or continue to the destination. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody has to waste <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fifteen minutes of valuable playing time running across West <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Karana. (3) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mhh debatable..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Death: Whether it is realistic or not, players retain all of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their equipment <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after death. Levels can&#39;t be lost due to death either. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Experience loss can be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regained by returning to the place of death (marked by a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gravestone) and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; praying. There is also a loss of constitution points which <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can be bought back <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from a merchant. Clerics can also revive experience and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constitution loss <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (just like EQ, but I thought I should mention it).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        There are other things that I like about DAoC also, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but these are the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biggees in my estimation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; H<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
