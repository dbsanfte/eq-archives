However, I discovered inadvertently in the process<br/>\nthat playing songs that use the drum seem to REALLY anger mobs a lot<br/>\nmore...as a matter of fact I was in a group of 6 and every orc that would<br/>\nspawn at the coastal orc camp (an warrior, an priest, a warrior, etc.) would<br/>\ncharge at me full speed and totally concentrate on trying to kill me - I<br/>\nnoticed that if I did not play percussion songs the MOBs would not be as<br/>\nhell bent to kill me, usually one 1 at a time would forget what they were<br/>\ndoing and decide the little wimpy bard with the instrument was the one he<br/>\nshould be killing instead of the buffed tank who is dual<br/>\nwield/attack/kick/bashing him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed this in the mino caves in steamfront...if I would turn on<br/>\naccelerando and go run through the tunnels and then back to the main cave to<br/>\nstand with my group, any MOB that would spawn in the next few minutes would<br/>\nimmediately run out of the tunnels and attack me...I didn&#39;t even have to be<br/>\nin range or in sight.  I started to think that the song must leave some kind<br/>\nof residual affect in an area that still provokes MOBS even a few minutes<br/>\nafter you have left.  It seems strange and unlikely, but I suspect others<br/>\nhave experienced something similar.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
