We are having an event on my server,<br/>\nKarana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the chessboard with duels.<br/>\nDifferent level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of King, Queen,<br/>\nBishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my guild has a<br/>\nmajor role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I would be asked to<br/>\nassist in the organization of the event. However, I have been chosen as a<br/>\nPAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ to possibly come<br/>\nout of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to some of the rules of<br/>\nthe game but that is because they are still being determined. I do know that<br/>\ncharming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>\nallowed. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best bard that I can<br/>\nbe and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of you......the experts!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodii (Bard of 11 seasons)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
