The poster&#39;s idea what to some of the<br/>\npieces act as actual instruments.  His reasoning is that the name of the<br/>\narmor is &quot;singing&quot; so it should increase the effectiveness of our songs.  So<br/>\nfor example the singing steel greaves would have String effect.  Singing a<br/>\nstring based song without a lute equipped but with the greaves on would have<br/>\nthe same effect as singing the song with a lute equipped.  And if you did<br/>\nequip an instrument, you would get double the effect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

I&#39;ve been playing my bard a whole lot more lately<br/>\nand having fun, but there are still times when I play my casters solely due<br/>\nto the inconveniences of being a melee class. ;-(<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat effects do you think would be good for us?  I know no one can be too<br/>\nthrilled about the Summon Food and Water.  What could we get that would be<br/>\nbetter used, seem like most of the other classes get truly useful effects so<br/>\nfar for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
