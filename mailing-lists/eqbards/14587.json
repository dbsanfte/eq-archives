They did this<br/>\nbecause they were dying too easily.  This is all fine and good for<br/>\npeople who have been there before, and have plane/dragon equipment and<br/>\nplane/dragon experience. (Actually its not, but at least you had a shot<br/>\nat it)  By the time we get there, there will be no chance.  We will not<br/>\nbe lvl 50 before expansion, I cant imagine what Verant is going to do to<br/>\nall those guys then...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say these things, I&#39;m not trying to rail on the lvl 50&#39;s.  If I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t left EQ from May till November, I&#39;d be a lvl 50 warrior with my<br/>\nregular group from back then.  (They all hit lvl 50 in Sept I think).  I<br/>\njust get annoyed when I see the future things I have been looking<br/>\nforward to (dragons especially) being made untouchable to the slow<br/>\nleveling people.  To be honest all the high levels being bored is<br/>\nspeeding my level progress right now, as they are often around to help<br/>\nme when I do something stupid (like die deep in Befallen) and they (at<br/>\nleast for me) are often genrorous with equipment...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
