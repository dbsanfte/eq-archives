Whatever happened did<br/>\nincrease the amount of missed notes encountered, OR, they replaced the<br/>\nrandom number generator with one that was even more clumpy than before,<br/>\nthough I doubt that.  I usually see 1 missed note on a Selo&#39;s per night<br/>\npreviously.  Now it is not uncommon for me to see 2-3 consecutive missed<br/>\nnotes on Selo&#39;s in a 3-5 hour session.  Before the last month or so I never<br/>\nsaw 2-3 consecutive missed notes on Selo&#39;s, never, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 11, 1999 10:50 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Missed notes on songs.

An example of this is whenever i learn a new<br/>\n&gt; word... it pops up all over the place. Before i just glanced over it and<br/>\n&gt; ignored it, but now it stands out like a signil fire. I would guess the<br/>\n&gt; same thing is hapenning here... and that nothing has changed, except maybe<br/>\n&gt; a *lessening* of missed notes as verant documented on the higher level<br/>\n&gt; songs. Some individual simply had a bad experiance and could not get selos<br/>\n&gt; started because he happened to have a bad roll of the dice at an<br/>\n&gt; inopportune time. And from that point on it just snowballed down hill and<br/>\n&gt; he started to notice the missed notes because he was now thinking about<br/>\n&gt; them unconsciously all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, it was *real*.  It was EXTREMELY frustrating, enough<br/>\nthat after two 3-5 hour nights of it (it wasn&#39;t one instantce<br/>\nof me being unable to get Selo&#39;s started) I quit my bard for<br/>\nalmost a week and played my enchanter instead.  When I finally<br/>\nplayed my bard again, the problem was *still* there.  I&#39;d been<br/>\nplanning on switching to my enchanter again, but my friends on<br/>\nmy bard server just got a guild started last night so I hopped<br/>\nin to join the guild and play a bit, and the problem was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can normally stack 3 songs no problem, sometimes 4.  During<br/>\nthe time I was having this missed note problem, I could only<br/>\nkeep 2 song icons up consistently, and sometimes manage 3.  <br/>\nIt was that bad.  Running the numbers, at a 5% missed note<br/>\nrate, you should be able to play 3 songs without a missed note<br/>\n85% of the time.  With a 20% missed note rate (which was my<br/>\noriginal estimate, but I stated it as 10%-20% because I *know*<br/>\nthe mind has a tendency to overestimate these things) you can<br/>\nonly play 3 songs without a mised note 51% of the time.  That<br/>\nfits my observations of keeping 3 songs going, so my 20%<br/>\nestimate was probably pretty accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI minored in social and cognitive psychology in undergrad.  <br/>\nMy graduate thesis topic was a statistical analysis of data<br/>\nchannel capacity in high-latency high-loss environments.  I<br/>\n*know* the tricks your mind can play on you, and I *know* how<br/>\nit&#39;s easy to mistake statistically random data for something<br/>\nelse.  This was NOT my imagination, it was real.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
