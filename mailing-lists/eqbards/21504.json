That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the <br/>\n&gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually <br/>\n&gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play <br/>\n&gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case <br/>\n&gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades <br/>\n&gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just <br/>\n&gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me <br/>\n&gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.  Thanks for ASSuming you know my playing style.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
