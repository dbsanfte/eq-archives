I know a Druid, who was givin<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>\n&gt;in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt;as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>\n&gt;but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>\n&gt;of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>\n&gt;true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and<br/>\n&gt;giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>\n&gt;into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>\n&gt;real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>\n&gt;enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I<br/>\n&gt;can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>\n&gt;why I paid to play EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Miriana Windryder<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
