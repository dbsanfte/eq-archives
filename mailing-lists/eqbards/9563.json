Qeynos Hills, which was the<br/>\n&gt; other undead spawn area, and Kithicor (to a lesser extent, were mostly for<br/>\n&gt; newbies btw 4-7 level.  So said newbie in Qeynos heads for his normal<br/>\n&gt; hunting grounds and BAM, Varsoon the undying hits you for 47pts of damage.<br/>\n&gt; These 4-7 level players in Qeynos have no other place to hunt. I think<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; have a right to complain that they lost their hunting area.  RV residents<br/>\n&gt; still have Misty Thicket so should have less to complain about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think levels 4-7 can still hunt in Qeynos Hills even with the Undead<br/>\nspawn.  They may have to group more..but this is a group oriented game.<br/>\nAlso when I went to Qeynos Hills this past weekend..several times at<br/>\ndifferent times of the day..I never found it with less than 50 people in<br/>\nzone.  Warbones and Varsoon had groups on them within a few minutes..making<br/>\nit less dangerous for the lower levels.  I didn&#39;t hear any complaints from<br/>\nlower level players..although there may have been some.  It seemed to me<br/>\nthat most people were having a good time.  Its a good sized zone..maybe they<br/>\ncould keep the undead north of the xroads and add a vendor south of the<br/>\nxroads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; No one is whining about dying in a fair fight.  You know when you go into<br/>\n&gt; Unrest that you are taking your chances. But Q Hills? I am a level 15 Bard<br/>\n&gt; and made it safely through the Hills only because I had Selo&#39;s and my drum<br/>\n&gt; equipped.  Incidently, I zoned into the Hills and immediately got hit by<br/>\n&gt; Varsoon, and this was at about 3 p.m. EQ time on Monday.  It was crawling<br/>\n&gt; with undead, so during the day there was no respite in the Hills!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just thought I&#39;d let you know<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Llyrean, Bard of the 15th Song<br/>\n&gt; Crimson Legacy<br/>\n&gt; Tailor, Baker, Brewer, Smith and Beauty Queen<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
