All my hard work paid off and now I am wielding this fine weapon<br/>\n(even though it don&#39;t proc yet, level 37 isn&#39;t it?).<br/>\nAlso today I picked up a Runed Falchion for 1500pp, Obsidian Scim and a<br/>\nForeman Tunic. Was this a good deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 35 Songs - Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
