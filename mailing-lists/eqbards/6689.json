SoW overpowering Accel was not an<br/>\n&gt; accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?  Obviously outdoors you<br/>\n&gt; would not since Accel is far faster especially as the bard playing grows.<br/>\n&gt; In our desire to not fall into the morrass of me too and I wanna be<br/>\n&gt; superman flame wars with Verant many of us (bards) have adopted the well<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re fine we&#39;re balanced banner.  It&#39;s simply no longer true in my<br/>\n&gt; opinion.  To discuss being worried about being a superclass is rather<br/>\n&gt; silly and after the point so few players over all choose or understand the<br/>\n&gt; bard that the other classes already point at us and complain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To close I&#39;m not interested in having our powers majorly overhauled.. or<br/>\n&gt; special super powered bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest<br/>\n&gt; system fixed.. I&#39;d like to see some more special items for bards.  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to see some more useful songs. And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing<br/>\n&gt; us without reguard to the results. I won&#39;t even get into balance, as right<br/>\n&gt; now I feel we are underbalanced now and others seem to think we are just<br/>\n&gt; fine. Anyway those are my two cents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adon Draigcanwyr 20 Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 17 Sep 1999 10:11:00 -0500 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think a lot of classes think they are &quot;most ingnored&quot;. I think however<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t get a lot of &quot;attention&quot; it is because  we are one of the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balanced classes in the game, that really need not a lot of effort to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balance us out. I could see more magic instruments, but I could also see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that making us too powerful in unintended ways, leading to nerfing,<br/>\n&gt; leading<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to screw-ups, etc. No, I don&#39;t think we need a bunch of new equiptment,<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it complicates what is to my mind a a fairly balanced equasion. I hope<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are careful with the changes that are coming to the test center (class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific quest-only weapons) because in the long run balance is WAY more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; important than goodies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 24, Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ??
