Nearly all the<br/>\ntanks I play with can outdamage me enough that they can pull<br/>\nanything off me within a song or two.  I toss in Chain every<br/>\nnow and then to better distribute the damage (pulling the/a<br/>\nmob off someone really getting beat up).  On average I&#39;d say I<br/>\ngo through about two rounds of twisting three songs before I&#39;m<br/>\nstunned.  My connection is good enough that I can miss a note<br/>\nor two and I still have enough time to keep three songs going.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or are you standing off with an instrument and playing for extra party<br/>\n&gt; effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll sometimes switch to a drum twisting Rhythm songs if we&#39;re<br/>\nup against a really nasty magical mob, especially if it can<br/>\ncharm.  It really depends on the makeup of the group.  If<br/>\nthere are plenty of tanks, you can back off and act sort of<br/>\nlike a caster with enhanced buffs and heals.  If you are the<br/>\nonly tank, or one of two, then you&#39;re probably going to be<br/>\ninterrupted frequently enough that melee is more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it ever help to equip lute for hp if you are getting hit on by strong<br/>\n&gt; mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends. :-)  If your party has multiple mobs hitting you,<br/>\nthen the damage you as a group are taking will far exceed what<br/>\nyou can heal, and you&#39;re better off killing the mobs ASAP.<br/>\nOnce the rate they&#39;re damaging you starts to approach your<br/>\nhealing rate, then it makes more sense to twist in healing. It<br/>\ncan make sense to equip a lute in a fight to heal, but usually<br/>\nonly if your group is all pretty badly hurt and you are<br/>\nbasically mopping up.  Otherwise, healing during a fight is<br/>\nbasically slowing down the rate you&#39;re dying at and<br/>\nlengthening the fight as a tradeoff.  (Wish I could draw this<br/>\n- it&#39;s much easier to explain graphically.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
