He remembers the<br/>\n&gt; patch that nerfed chains,<br/>\n&gt; but he doesn&#39;t know how it affected the lower level<br/>\n&gt; song. Again with<br/>\n&gt; lullaby, he remembers the last time it was looked<br/>\n&gt; at, but doesn&#39;t know that<br/>\n&gt; we still see a HUGE problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m hopelessly optimistic and refuse to see<br/>\n&gt; the truth that is evident,<br/>\n&gt; but I just can&#39;t imagine that he knows and is<br/>\n&gt; covering it up. Instead I<br/>\n&gt; think that he is hopelessly swamped by email,<br/>\n&gt; message board postings and<br/>\n&gt; whatever other work he may have and in that mountain<br/>\n&gt; of information, ours<br/>\n&gt; got pushed to the bottom and  never seen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 10, 2000 11:37 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Oh this can&#39;t be good....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I generally try to be open-minded, but...<br/>\n&gt; I agree with you on the experience parts of your<br/>\n&gt; post, not a big deal, and<br/>\n&gt; its not going to change.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the song related parts of your post though, have<br/>\n&gt; you been living under a<br/>\n&gt; rock for the last 6 months?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There have been numerous postings to the EQ boards,<br/>\n&gt; emails directly to GZ<br/>\n&gt; and Abashi, posts on the EQ_Caster&#39;s Board (which<br/>\n&gt; they do read), as well as<br/>\n&gt; messages sent thru Baelish (runs EQ_Casters, talks<br/>\n&gt; to GZ nearly daily).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many of these posts have contained ridiculously<br/>\n&gt; detailed information on the<br/>\n&gt; problems with the broken songs.  John Kim and myself<br/>\n&gt; have broken the things<br/>\n&gt; down statistically to the point where it was readily<br/>\n&gt; apparent that the<br/>\n&gt; resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with<br/>\n&gt; variances of +/- 2 tenths<br/>\n&gt; of a percent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know what we think is<br/>\n&gt; wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They<br/>\n&gt; ARE ignoring us.<br/>\n&gt; (Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>\n&gt; Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case<br/>\n&gt; they are purposely<br/>\n&gt; lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have<br/>\n&gt; no idea that we think<br/>\n&gt; there is a problem that needs to be looked at.<br/>\n&gt; Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and<br/>\n&gt; hope that he missed our<br/>\n&gt; posts or forgot them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) If we can make them aware of what we think is<br/>\n&gt; wrong, then we can get them<br/>\n&gt; to look at it and there is a possibility that we can<br/>\n&gt; get it fixed. This to<br/>\n&gt; me is good news. The only problem is how to get our<br/>\n&gt; thoughts looked at. I<br/>\n&gt; suggest we write up a concise description of the<br/>\n&gt; problems. (insane resist<br/>\n&gt; rates on pixie strike and lullaby and<br/>\n&gt; ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>\n&gt; patch) then we post it to the bug board and the<br/>\n&gt; gameplay board, as well as<br/>\n&gt; emailing it to abashi.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nKick off your party with Yahoo!
