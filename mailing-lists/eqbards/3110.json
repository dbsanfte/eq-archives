First off, thanks to all who responded.  I&#39;d have<br/>\nsaid that sooner but had some email issues and so wasn&#39;t getting these<br/>\nmailings for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve done some experimenting & maybe what I have to say will be of<br/>\nsome benefit to other newbies here.  Apologies if this has already been<br/>\ncovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue was that, grouped with a lvl 7 halfling druid and being a lvl 7<br/>\nwood elf bard myself, and with neither of us carrying anything (no weapons,<br/>\nno armor, no food, no nada) she would continuously outrun the affects of my<br/>\nsong.  Racing her with no songs or spells, she still outruns me.  So we<br/>\ncompared pings & packets & such.  No big differences.  We compared modems.<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a 56K that usually connects at 28.8, the druid&#39;s got cable modem,<br/>\nbut has run EQ on a 28.8 and had no problems then.  Then we compared PCs.<br/>\nMine&#39;s a P300 MMX, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB on the video.   The druid runs on dual<br/>\n200s with 194 MB RAM and a similar video card.   Grrr.  Guess I&#39;ll have to<br/>\nget used to being a slow poke as I haven&#39;t got a couple grand burning a hole<br/>\nin my pocket at the moment to upgrade hardware.  I&#39;ve since gotten a drum,<br/>\nand have challenged her to a race when next we meet, but if I group with her<br/>\nit won&#39;t alter the fact that she&#39;ll outrun me without trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to be able to do<br/>\nthis, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW & Accelerado.  The only<br/>\ntime we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went into the second<br/>\nspace and SOW in the third.  <br/>\n<br/>\nL8R<br/>\nWeb  AKA Evulia on Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
