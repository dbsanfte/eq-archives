I know you all are probably getting<br/>\npetitions on alot of these so hopefully this information will allow you to <br/>\ninform players that it was a change and not a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are any others we may have missed please report them to your server <br/>\nGM so that we can verify that they were indeed<br/>\nintentional changes and not bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSolist<br/>\n<br/>\nNormal arrows (item 8005)have had their range reduced from 50 to 25. This is <br/>\nbecause fletched arrows are range 50 and a<br/>\nflectcher making his own arrows should have better arrows than generic <br/>\nstorebought ones. No other arrows were affected<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Box of Abu-Kar has had the it´┐¢s weight reduction greatly reduced. <br/>\n(don´┐¢t have exact reduction specs)<br/>\n<br/>\n-The item Glowing Stein has been changed to Stein of Moggok<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Lustrous Russet Armor is now warrior only, a previous error had caused <br/>\nit to be used by several other classes despite the<br/>\nfact it was always intented to be warrior only<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Fletching kit now has 8 slots. This is to allow more items added into <br/>\nthe process to make new bows.<br/>\n<br/>\n-New tailoring items have been added. Tailors can now make the silk series <br/>\nof armor. The books on how to manufacture these<br/>\nare also in the game, but are spawn drops and not vendor sales.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vendors who previously sold just arrow nocks now sell all of the fletching <br/>\nmaterials.<br/>\n<br/>\nReported by a Player (Remf the Troll)<br/>\n<br/>\n-nobles crests from the npc paladins in swamp are nodrop now<br/>\n-kolandi fish now nodrop<br/>\n-erud tonic now nodrop<br/>\n-honeyjum now require high faction to acquire<br/>\n-egg shaped pumice now casts dispel magic instead of pillage enchantment<br/>\n-monster frenzy AI tweaked<br/>\n-crafted armor now sells to vendor for 10x lower prices<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;bugs&quot;<br/>\n-fishies still swim in the air<br/>\n-items dropped on ground become permanent fixtures, at least client side<br/>\n-teleporting monsters play leapfrog when the appear, keep jumping on top of <br/>\nyou<br/>\n-new arrow range overrides bow rating (25 arrow + 150 bow = 25 arrow range <br/>\n:/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
