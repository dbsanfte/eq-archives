The damage it<br/>\nabsorbs is subtracted from X, until X drops below 0.  The<br/>\namount that X drops below 0 is applied as damage to you.  So<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t really matter how much damage a mob can hit for -<br/>\nthe last hit will always get through to damage you (unless it<br/>\ndoes *exactly* the amount of damage remaining on the shield),<br/>\nand since it was applied with your lowered AGI (and thus lower<br/>\nAC), it will be for a lot of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you get to higher level mobs that do more damage per hit,<br/>\nthe extra damage due to this final hit starts to approach the<br/>\namount of damage the shield absorbs, thus limiting the PGT&#39;s<br/>\nusefulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the PGT also overwrites higher level rune spells,<br/>\nwhich is bad if your enchanter just happened to cast one on<br/>\nyou (they are equivalent to heal spells, but cast before<br/>\ndamage is applied instead of after - very handy in a tight<br/>\nspot).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
