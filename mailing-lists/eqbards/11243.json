Died<br/>\n&gt; several times the first nite, due to poor groups - my enchanter husband<br/>\nkept<br/>\n&gt; telling people which thing to kill (he was mezzing the others), but they<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t follow his direction - but later we got a great group going in the<br/>\nBK<br/>\n&gt; room, and some higher level friends of ours got a group going in the<br/>\nKnight<br/>\n&gt; room upstairs and were handy to help in case we got in trouble... And,<br/>\nuntil<br/>\n&gt; almost the entire server crashed, we were doing great and having much fun!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same on all servers, but on The Rathe,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; skeletons do not have a nametag like all the other NPCs. I petitioned this<br/>\n&gt; (first time I ever petitioned anything), because at one point we were<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to fight three or four different skeles, and it was hard to get targeted<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; correct one to fight (and some were having a hard time figuring out how to<br/>\n&gt; use the assist command...) - but I digress... I basically petitioned that<br/>\n&gt; the skeles get nametags so they would be easier to target and identify,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; an assistant got right back to me (I was impressed) and said he understood<br/>\n&gt; my point and was going to request they fix that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now... I was wondering if any of you have gotten such quick response and<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; anyone has ever seen them fix things like that... or if it takes them a<br/>\n&gt; while to fix things like that... Just curious what kind of responses<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; have gotten, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Safe journeys all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ==Lady Brangwen Incantare of the 22nd Song<br/>\n&gt; ====The Lavender-Eyed Lady of Song<br/>\n&gt; ======Squire Court of The Guild New Outriders<br/>\n&gt; ========Citizen of the City of Kelethin on Faydwer<br/>\n&gt; =========Wife of High Elf Enchanter, Callais Incantare<br/>\n&gt; ===========Server: The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; ===============================================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
