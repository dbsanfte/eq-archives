All folks engaging in the event were told to un-mem any DoT spells/songs, and leave any weapons that proc DoT&#39;s either in the bank, or unequipped.  Seeing as I was the organizer, I left my beloved Kisch in the bank (-=sigh!=-) and whooped out the ol&#39; Obsidian Shard.  The Shard (from all I have read is SUPPOSEDLY a simple 30pt DD proc. right?  Well, imagine my suprise when a few ticks (not sure hopw many) after it procs, I get the old &quot;The Obsidian Shatter effect has worn off&quot; message.  Question:  Was there an update to this weapon that I missed?  (haven&#39;t used it in over a month)<br/>\nbtw... No matter what Abashi says, Necro and Bard fears STILL work in the Arena&#39;s PvP zone, and in a Duel(he even replied to a post of mine about it saying they disabled it).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nBarrd Talespinner  (aka NOR Bard)<br/>\nCount of the New OutRiders<br/>\nTroll-Smacker Emeritus<br/>\n28th Season of filling The Rathe with song<br/>\nCreator of BS Titles<br/>\nAnd One Helluva Nice Guy  ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
