If they are close a<br/>\nlioness can hit you continuously.  I don&#39;t know if it can outrun my but it<br/>\ncan keep up.  With the drum I can pull away quite easily though.  I would<br/>\nlike to the thank the person that posted about setting up instruments and<br/>\nhot keys.  This has saved my like more than once.  The only modification I<br/>\nmade is that I also set up another button to put my shield in.  If I pick<br/>\nsomething up it goes in to that slot but I trade what is in that slot for<br/>\nthe shield.  Almost always I would rather lose what was in that spot than my<br/>\nshield if something would happen.  While I am running if I have the chance I<br/>\nwill put what was in that spot into a backpack.  I don&#39;t worry about losing<br/>\nmy shield this way.
