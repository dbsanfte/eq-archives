It was to <br/>\n  address those dumb fawks who were standing in safe spots and killing<br/>\n  monsters.  Now the mobs warp on you.  (They can hit you, you cannot<br/>\n  hit them).  But they don&#39;t do it once, they do it everytime you move.<br/>\n  Thus, I lose 50% of my combat rounds trying to skirt around to hit<br/>\n  the enemy before it plops down ontop of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And they wonder why players find ways to trick monsters or exploit<br/>\n  them.  I feel like the monsters are exploiting me!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
