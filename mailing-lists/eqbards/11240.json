Also, both of us DID take<br/>\nresponsibility for our own situations.  Perhaps if I quote my post:<br/>\n<br/>\nJeez that sounds familiar.  Same thing happened to a ranger and a warrior<br/>\nfrom my guild.  Same spot and all.  And in our situation, the GM&#39;s still<br/>\nsaid tough sh*t.  We finally managed to do the CR after a 6 hour stint with<br/>\nthe help of a level 30 something Shaman and Druid.  It was a nightmare.<br/>\nGlad it worked out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said that the GM said tough sh*t, I was paraphrasing.  The GM said<br/>\nthat we needed to find a way to get the corpses ourselves.  That we did.<br/>\nAnd no one went crying as you so eloquently put it.  Nowhere in either<br/>\nSlyde&#39;s or my posts did it say that we expected the GM to do a damn thing.<br/>\nI was simply stating that I have seen that same point at which he died and I<br/>\nknowits a tough spot, but I am glad it all worked out for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I have never bugged anything.  I have never petitioned for<br/>\nanything.  I thoroughly enjoy my character and the way he plays, despite the<br/>\nflaws.  What I have grown incredibly tired of however is the recurring<br/>\nflames on this list.  Perhaps before you post your retort, you should<br/>\nattempt to read between the lines on a post.  Instead of downing every post<br/>\nthat you disagree with, take a position, state it and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all glad to have the info that comes through this list from the likes<br/>\nof John, Shada, Harmonic and many others.  I look forward to reading this<br/>\nlist.  If people who don&#39;t have the experience that you do post something<br/>\nthat is inaccurate, correct it, don&#39;t laugh at it in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland<br/>\n&lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Oh and to answer your hopes, yes, I have made quite a few friends.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
