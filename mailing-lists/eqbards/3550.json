If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;soloing a blue and it&#39;s a close fight, charm it, equip a lute,<br/>\n&gt;and weave Hymn and Sirens.  You will heal and the mob will<br/>\n&gt;mostly stay charmed.  When you&#39;re comfortably healed, continue<br/>\n&gt;the fight.  Be careful of the green-stuff-attacking-pet note<br/>\n&gt;above - stuff that you&#39;re not used to having attack you may<br/>\n&gt;attack your pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;It works beautifully for stopping kill stealing casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t quite work like that.  You can charm it once, but you cannot<br/>\nmaintain the charm.  The only time you can charm it again is after the charm<br/>\nhas worn off, and by that time both monsters are beating on you, making it<br/>\ndifficult to regain your positioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting note is that in PvP servers (only one I can really vouch<br/>\nfor) people can still kill your pet regardless of level limit.  For example<br/>\nI was overseeing a little skirmish at the orc obelisk in Butcherblock with a<br/>\ncouple of kill stealers messing with a legitimate party&#39;s kills.  After a<br/>\nwhile I attempted to charm the mob, thinking they wouldnt be able to attack<br/>\nit since I was level 34 and they were level 15.  However they were still<br/>\nable to attack it and get the credit for the experience and the kill.  ALSO,<br/>\nif you&#39;re making two mobs fight charmed and say you kill the first one, get<br/>\nthe exp, and the second is more than halfway down in health, turns on you,<br/>\nand someone steals the kill, they get the experience.  The damage it<br/>\nsustains while under your control doesn&#39;t count as damage you&#39;ve inflicted,<br/>\nwhich adds a bit of strategy if you&#39;re concerned about getting both kills.<br/>\n<br/>\nKa`Lend of the warlord server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
