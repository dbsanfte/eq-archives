It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>\n&gt; something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>\n&gt; of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>\n&gt; advancement-based RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  This paragraph very clearly summarized my point exactly.<br/>\n  I don&#39;t understand why people, who obviously understand<br/>\n  that I&#39;m giving MY opinion, are all bent out of shape<br/>\n  over this topic.  If you say you respect other opinions<br/>\n  why do I sense people getting irritated/questioning posts<br/>\n  made by other people with, allbeit, differing opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  X person posted that it wasnt fair that they couldn&#39;t get<br/>\n  Lambent armor because they don&#39;t have friends who want to<br/>\n  help them out and that they were not high enough to complete<br/>\n  the quests on their own.  This is where the &#39;you don&#39;t deserve<br/>\n  it&#39; line comes in, which people instantly took offense to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The way I see it, everyone here is trying to justify how/why<br/>\n  they earned their Lambent, and I frankly don&#39;t care.  That<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t the issue.  I am not for/against twinking.  I do it,<br/>\n  I&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s happened to me, it&#39;s happened for me.<br/>\n  The issue is these people who whine about NOT being able to<br/>\n  get the armor regardless of level due to the fact they don&#39;t<br/>\n  have the know-how, the friends, the level, the resources, or<br/>\n  the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s really easy to read into the words on this page, and get<br/>\n  the wrong idea.  In a matter-of-fact tone, non-condescending,<br/>\n  Lambent armor was geared for mid level acquisition.  When<br/>\n  I see L20s complaining about the hardships of Lambent armor,<br/>\n  I just chuckle.  Because IMO you don&#39;t need that armor yet.<br/>\n  But if you do earn a piece; congrats!  It&#39;s not easy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you&#39;ve got some negative reply to make to this post, I don&#39;t<br/>\n  want to see it on the list.  I&#39;m kinda over the berating of one<br/>\n  particular person over the way they see things.  Feel free to<br/>\n  flame me in PRIVATE.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
