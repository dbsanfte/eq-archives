I have<br/>\n&gt;max ability in both for my current level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You need a better weapon.  I&#39;m still using a Mino axe at level 14.  I got it<br/>\naround level 6 or so for 5 pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2)  I wear a combination of patchwork and leather armor.  My tunic and<br/>\n&gt;leggings are patchwork.  Most of everything else is leather.

If you&#39;ve got patchwork, go<br/>\nright to banded, don&#39;t spend money on leather in between.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3)  I do not dabble in any of the trades.  I will start brewing once I am<br/>\n&gt;able to get my hands on brewing supplies.  Currently, the only place to buy<br/>\n&gt;brewing supplies is on the Antonica continent.

When I make 10th<br/>\n&gt;level, I know I need to go to Freeport to purchase the Anthem de Arms song.<br/>\n&gt;Not certain how much this will cost me but I&#39;m not going to make a major<br/>\n&gt;purchase until I buy that song first.  With the money I have left over, I<br/>\n&gt;need to either buy better armor or a better weapon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I buy armor, should I wait until I have enough money to buy a banded<br/>\n&gt;tunic or should I buy a leather tunic, which is cheaper.
