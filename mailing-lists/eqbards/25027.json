Depending on lag it can take me a<br/>\nfew combat rounds to get the timing right, but after that I never have<br/>\nproblemos with 3 songs.. Thought it might interest you since Im from europe<br/>\ntoo (denmark) with a 256kbit/sec ISDN. I use TDC as provider. Before I got<br/>\nADSL I used ISDN and tried serveral providers:<br/>\n- World Online<br/>\n- CyberCity<br/>\n- Mira<br/>\n- TDC<br/>\n- Uni2<br/>\n- Get2Net<br/>\nFor everyone but TDC and uni2 the connection was ok when I used it outside<br/>\nprime hours (primehours being 19:00-&gt;23:00) but lag increased (for some<br/>\nproviders severly) during primehours.<br/>\nWith TDC and the lag dont increase much even during primetime, and with Uni2<br/>\nthe connection is PERFECT!!<br/>\nUni2 is however way too expensive!<br/>\nIts a bit more difficualt to test providers when using ADSL *grin*, so I<br/>\nhavent experimented around..<br/>\nWell back to topic..<br/>\nI can twist 4 songs with only a few failures, but its simply too much a<br/>\nhazzle to do. With 3 songs I can throw in a /g add<br/>\n/g mezzin /g charmed if needs be. That is impossible with 4. I also do not<br/>\ntwist during downtime unless its really needed (Cleric need to get mana and<br/>\nhealth is low for instance (cantana, healing or cantana, clarity, clarity..)<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 13. juni 2001 11:01<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] OT - Equipment question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I use a PIII 800 with 256 Meg of Ram and  GForce II with 32 <br/>\n&gt; meg of video memory.  <br/>\n&gt; I can do three songs with ease -- barring lag which gets <br/>\n&gt; pretty heavy at times in Europe -- even with an adsl <br/>\n&gt; connection.  4 songs are managable under really good <br/>\n&gt; circumstances with, as some others have mentioned, a bit of <br/>\n&gt; drop off at the end...<br/>\n&gt; on guild raids with six groups fighting in close proximity, <br/>\n&gt; twisting more than two songs is tough, but managable.<br/>\n&gt; SOmebody mentioned that Win98 is a poor memorymanager and I <br/>\n&gt; must agree -- Can anybody comment on Win ME doing a better <br/>\n&gt; job of this?

So I played <br/>\n&gt; hit and miss.<br/>\n&gt; Months back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100. <br/>\n&gt;  I didn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; any noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron <br/>\n&gt; (overclocked to<br/>\n&gt; 450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>\n&gt; There was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my <br/>\n&gt; clipping plane<br/>\n&gt; maxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free <br/>\n&gt; run.  I fact<br/>\n&gt; I did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>\n&gt; However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  <br/>\n&gt; If I turn the<br/>\n&gt; clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a <br/>\n&gt; decent trade off<br/>\n&gt; in viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the <br/>\n&gt; TNT card is<br/>\n&gt; holding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming <br/>\n&gt; out later in<br/>\n&gt; the year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.
