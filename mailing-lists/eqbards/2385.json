However, I am not a <br/>\nhardcore roleplayer.<br/>\n<br/>\nA hardcore roleplayer would recognize that a boat crash is one of the <br/>\nnatural disasters of Norrath, and would play around it.  You ended up<br/>\nlost in OOT?  Well, start swimming.  Swim for a few hours, or even days.<br/>\nMaybe you will find an island where the boat stops.  Maybe you will die.<br/>\nIf you die, then you come back to OOT, use your corpse location song to<br/>\nfind your body, note the direction from a known starting point, retrieve<br/>\nit and return.  (Actually, if you&#39;re a real hardcore roleplayer, you die<br/>\nand start a new character.  This business about restarting at a binding<br/>\npoint after dying is simply a game artifact to make the game more playable.<br/>\nFrom a roleplaying standpoint, it&#39;s an abomination.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since the poster already admitted that he petitioned GMs for help<br/>\n(another roleplaying abomination) and he asked for advice on this list<br/>\n(another roleplaying abomination), I can only assume that he does not fall<br/>\ninto this hardcore roleplayer camp, and really just wants to get back to<br/>\nenjoying the game, with as little frustration as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan there really be any true hardcore roleplayers reading this list?  The<br/>\nknowledge that is disseminated here is not knowledge that your character<br/>\nshould have access to.  The game provides a roleplaying mechanism for the<br/>\nexchange of knowledge: travel the world and speak to your fellow bards.<br/>\nThis list is simply an expedience for those of us who want a shortcut to<br/>\ngetting better at the game, roleplaying issues aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nPurna<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
