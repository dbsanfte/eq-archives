For me<br/>\nthat fits better with my concept of a bard.  It doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>\nfor a bard to be dressed like a tank in full plate.  I&#39;d far rather see<br/>\nbards dressed in things that are light, effective, and exotic.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I spent money on two gold earring that don&#39;t even show unless<br/>\nyou inspect me closely and give me no improvements.  They fit my concept.<br/>\nI look forward to trading them for something equally charismatic and with a<br/>\npractical touch of magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI split my extra stat points mostly among strength, which I figured was<br/>\ngood for my fighter side, and charisma, which has been good for my ability<br/>\nto make money and fits perfectly with my concept of a bard as the charming,<br/>\nrogueish musician who&#39;s pretty good in a fight.  As I recall I may have put<br/>\nsome into agility, too, as some of those rogueish skills could someday<br/>\nprove quite useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find a deep sense of character an important enhancement to raw capability<br/>\nand ultimately the higher driving force.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush of Freeport (so far) in Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
