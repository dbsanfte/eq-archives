By definition, anything that helps someone<br/>\nelse is a disadvantage for me.  If that weren&#39;t the case, we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t need to balance anything, and it wouldn&#39;t matter if<br/>\nanyone cheated, duped, kill stole, harvested, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you deny that when too many people are in Unrest, your<br/>\nenjoyment of the game suffers?  Do you think it suddenly<br/>\nbecomes that way once you exceed X number of people?  Of<br/>\ncourse not.  As X increases from 0, the average enjoyment of<br/>\nthe players goes up (easier to break in), peaks, then starts<br/>\nto go down.  Being too high level, twinked, having equipment<br/>\nunavailable to others, etc, can cause your contribution to X<br/>\nto be greater than 1; meaning if things are at the downward<br/>\nslope of the enjoyment curve, your presence is hurting them<br/>\nmore than their presence is hurting you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yeah - they might have it a bit easier, so? Given the opportunity to use<br/>\n&gt; better stuff - don&#39;t you take it? I just can&#39;t understand this at all -<br/>\n&gt; especially in an environment that is so group oriented that any pluses a<br/>\n&gt; group member may have is going to HELP you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If something someone else has/does can help you, then it&#39;s<br/>\nalso possible for something someone else has/does to hurt<br/>\nyou.  You can attempt to place a &quot;diode&quot; upon this reciprocity<br/>\n(which is what the PvP switch does), but it will never be<br/>\nperfect.  Eliminating all hurtful interactions would require<br/>\nthe elimination of all interactions, at which point it&#39;s no<br/>\nlonger a multi-player game.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
