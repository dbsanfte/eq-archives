I spent about 2 months at lvl 23. I was spending a<br/>\nlot of time running around to wherever my friends were<br/>\nso I could associate with them.  Also they had more<br/>\ntime to play so even though they played 2 or 3 char.<br/>\nall of them were soon higher than me and going places<br/>\nthat were a little too hard for me... among other<br/>\nthings i was in sol a at 23  dying a lot, in cazic<br/>\ncourtyard (still 23barely). dying a lot.  in upper guk<br/>\nat 23(almost lost 23 there) ... (Oh .. forgot you<br/>\ncouldnt gate-- gotta love pickup groups).. ... dying a<br/>\nlot... these all have long corpse runs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to move to high keep and am now 26, just 3<br/>\nweeks later.  The waiting list in ungodly. I would<br/>\nusually log in AT LEAST an hour before i want to play<br/>\nand get my name on waiting lists (usually would be #7<br/>\nor so). I would then wander by and check the cptr<br/>\nevery few minutes while i do housework.  (The dishes<br/>\nand laundry have to be done sometime).  Then when i<br/>\nwas ready to play, I would double check with the list<br/>\nkeeper where i was on the list and then either go out<br/>\ninto high pass and goof around or go upstairs and work<br/>\non brewing and baking. I could usually get into a<br/>\ngroup less than two hours after I got on the list.  . <br/>\n.  . One night alas... it took 5 hours... just as i<br/>\nwas at 5 seconds to camp a tell comes in telling me my<br/>\nplace was up... <br/>\n <br/>\nI dont think it is just that high keep is such an<br/>\nawesome place (although it is, bind in same<br/>\nzone!!!drastically reduces down time) Also in 24 and<br/>\n25 i had a combined total of 5 deaths.. and two of<br/>\nthem were in everfrost getting my icy greaves to make<br/>\nlambent(which i also accomplished in the last three<br/>\nweeks).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe technique of getting on a list and just waiting<br/>\nwhile you do other stuff will work well almost<br/>\nanwhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Pinen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ubersorcerer@...\">ubersorcerer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a casual player I&#39;m having a hard time getting<br/>\n&gt; out of 23rd level is this<br/>\n&gt; the place for me I&#39;m currently in Sol A but keep<br/>\n&gt; dieing...I can solo in SK<br/>\n&gt; and Lake rathe with little or no problem but exp is<br/>\n&gt; sloooooooooooow and<br/>\n&gt; finding an open spot in LR is hard.<br/>\n&gt; Pinen<br/>\n&gt; 23 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nHarmonie Moonsong<br/>\n&lt;Lost Souls of Norrath&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 26th chorus<br/>\nBristlebane server<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/harmoniemoonsong\">http://www.geocities.com/harmoniemoonsong</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
