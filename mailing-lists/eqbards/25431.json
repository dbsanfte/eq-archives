Then we waited for rage, and waited, and waited<br/>\n  some more, finally on sunday Rage showed up, and dropped 3 red scales woot.<br/>\n  I log out afterwards cause had to go out of town for a few hours.  When I<br/>\n  log in later, they&#39;re buffing up for Gore, so I got there asap and I got my<br/>\n  white scale from her!  I&#39;m in utter shock, got my 2 scales on the same day,<br/>\n  now its just a matter of time before phinny drops his spine for me.
