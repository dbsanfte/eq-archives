I for one do not<br/>\nlike petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be the way to get<br/>\nthings fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer of the Bard<br/>\npetition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some people to make new<br/>\ncomments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The ball is in our<br/>\ncourt so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on things we would like<br/>\nto have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, and believe it<br/>\nor not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained a lot more<br/>\nabout there class.  I have to say though that my Mage character was a lot<br/>\nmore balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the Mages out by<br/>\nfixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few ideas to get<br/>\nthe ball rolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is<br/>\nchange the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats<br/>\nmight be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem.<br/>\nI have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be<br/>\nno debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>\n2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>\n3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>\npoint it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>\ncoin.<br/>\n5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a<br/>\ncrossbow or bow?<br/>\n6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be<br/>\nused as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>\nsinging songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas<br/>\nhere would help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a constructive way to<br/>\nhelp solve some bard issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nFair thee well friends!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
