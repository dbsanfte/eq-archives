If <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t exploiting, they were probably up to something just as bad.<br/>\n2) As has been supported by GMs, Guides, and the programming of the game: <br/>\nIf someone leaves a corpse long enough for someone else to loot it, it&#39;s <br/>\nFAIR GAME.  Their own darn fault.<br/>\n3) The fact that you wanted to stay around and get a mask should have been <br/>\nclue enough, but obviously they didn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple explanation for what happened is that occasionally, if a mob has <br/>\nno loot, the corpse will vanish very quickly after dropping.  There never <br/>\nwas a mask, and they are idiots for accusing you.  Do what I do.  Ignore them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
