Bards do provide a lot of input <br/>\n&gt; into what is seen in game graphically, so this can be an <br/>\n&gt; important topic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 <br/>\n&gt; 16 MB AGP graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But <br/>\n&gt; more memory and a better graphics card are in reach due to <br/>\n&gt; Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - done.  So now I want <br/>\n&gt; to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards they use, <br/>\n&gt; have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything <br/>\n&gt; else of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate <br/>\n&gt; in WW and some places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down <br/>\n&gt; and hope they don&#39;t scrape me off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\n&gt; Luclin without a better card.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again for all the help,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Piemur Draggonsinger 42 bard<br/>\n&gt; Robiinton Masterrhealer 32 cleric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
