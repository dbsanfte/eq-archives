I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d even take Imbrued over them. (well, I&#39;d take<br/>\nem, cause they look great and are our planar armor) I would suggest heading<br/>\nto sol a, getting a good group and hunting the bar. A good puller can pull<br/>\nsome solussek champions and you should see the fiery vambraces. then make<br/>\nanother group and kick choon and froon&#39;s ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoots: again, go with the lambent. (same stats as the vambraces) These are a<br/>\nlittle tougher to get, but way easier than getting DWB. the firewalker boots<br/>\ncome from solussek mages which are in the slightly tougher area near the<br/>\nking in sol a. With a strong group though, you can get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nChest: go with bronze, much cheaper than steel and same ac. the down side is<br/>\nit&#39;s ugly. If you can&#39;t stand the hideous bronze color, then I suggest<br/>\ncharred. (ac 16, +3 str, +6 sta) Charred should still cost way less than<br/>\nsteel (average on the tribunal server is 600-800 p)<br/>\n<br/>\nHead: Skull shaped Barbute (ac 13, +35 hp, +10 vs magic) hands down one of<br/>\nthe best pieces of headgear in the game. average price on tribunal is<br/>\n300-500 p.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrist: Lambent Bracers (ac 9, +4 str, +1 cha) you can take griffenes solo<br/>\nI&#39;d think (although you may need to kite them a while) as for the dark boned<br/>\nbracelet, shouldn&#39;t be too hard to get in a group in unrest. ac can&#39;t be<br/>\nbeat on these. the other viable option IMO is symbol of loyalty to vox (ac<br/>\n7, +7 vs cold, weight 0.3) these usually cost less than silver plated and I<br/>\nfind the +vs cold to be more useful than the +vs poison and disease)<br/>\n<br/>\nHands and Leggings: I suggest going with shin. it&#39;s no drop and it seems<br/>\nthat players are generally more than happy to give you the looting rights.<br/>\nthey also drop very near the zone to upper guk, so getting them doesn&#39;t<br/>\npresent much danger. I suggest bringing some extra food and some plat so you<br/>\ncan play banker, the campers will definitely appreciate you if you do.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 21, 2000 12:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] mid level armour questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just made 26 and couldn&#39;t train Instil Doubt in Freeport (though it was<br/>\nlate I was tired and I think I didn&#39;t check the other guildmaster), no<br/>\nbiggie, I need to go to Kelethin to buy Screech anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, just want to make sure that I am headed in the right direction, based on<br/>\nwhat I am reading on this list I am selling my stat boosting items that take<br/>\nme over 100 and replacing them with AC, I also traded my Kobold Hide boots<br/>\nfor a Staff of Writhing (I know, it won&#39;t proc for two more levels but it is<br/>\nbetter than my polished granite Tomahawk). The charisma hit was no fun, it<br/>\ntakes me to 98 chr, but I will probably strade a +3str earing for a +?<br/>\ncharisma earing and be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have about 400pp now (though barefoot :o) still have to sell the PGT, and<br/>\ntrying to decide on armour choices, I can&#39;t play a lot, and when I do will<br/>\nprobably solo, so my money situation is not going to skyrocket, here are my<br/>\npartially informed ideas, all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nArms:<br/>\nKeeping my Barbed Armplates: (AC 7. +2 Dexterity), Steel Vambraces: (AC 8)<br/>\nonly get me 1 AC<br/>\n<br/>\nBack:<br/>\nFigure I will keep my Lizardscale Cloak: (AC 8 + 5 to Dexterity), at level<br/>\n17 I did comedy standup (died once, lizzies do NOT get social commentary<br/>\nhumor) for about 2 hours at Cazic Zone until someone sold me it for 80pp. I<br/>\nthink I made a third of that banking at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nChest:<br/>\nI still have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: (AC 12, +8 to heat, cold and magic<br/>\nprotection.) which frankly is still nice for pulling with it&#39;s resists..but<br/>\nthat AC hit is hurting...so, not having 1kpp for a Brigandine Tunic (and<br/>\nhowever much for a Mithril) I am thinking Steel Breastplate (AC 17)<br/>\n<br/>\nFace:<br/>\nUntil my dream of a Mask of Deception dreams come true I am going to stick<br/>\nwith my bronze mask, I don&#39;t see a huge benefit to steel<br/>\n<br/>\nFeet:<br/>\nOf course I would love Dwarven Work Boots: (AC 8 STR+3, DEX+5) but though I<br/>\nhave no idea what they go for I am guessing it is too rich for my blood, so<br/>\nSteel Boots (AC 8) seems the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHands:<br/>\nGah, I love my Elf Hide Gloves (I checked, it is no one I know :o) (AC 4. +5<br/>\ndesterity, +5 Agility) but if I can keep my dex and agi above 100 I am going<br/>\nto go for Plate gauntlets (AC 9), or, I suppose, if they don&#39;t cost a<br/>\nfortune Shin Gauntlets ( AC 7. +5 poison)<br/>\n<br/>\nHead:<br/>\nI have a Blackened Iron Crown (AC 5. +5 Strength, and +5 each to poison,<br/>\nfire, cold, disease and magic resistances) but am thinking I would start<br/>\nsaving for the (Crested Helm: AC 10. +6 st, +3 char) or at least a Fine Silk<br/>\nTurban (AC 10, SV Fire +10) though, and I know this places me in the extreme<br/>\nminority, I *like* the Bird-Head look of a metal helm on a Wood Elf. There<br/>\nis also a Griffon Helm (AC 10. +9 str, +5 agil).<br/>\n<br/>\nLegs:<br/>\nI am thinking of keeping my Barbed Legplates (AC 8. +2 Agility) until I can<br/>\nget Silver-Plated Leggings (AC 10. +3 strength, +5 agility)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeck:<br/>\nAck, finally goingto give up that Spiked Collar (AC 3. +3 to Strength) and<br/>\ngo with a Steel Collar (AC 6)<br/>\n<br/>\nShoulders:<br/>\nLove the Bloodstained Mantle: (AC 6. +3 to strength, +10 magic protection)<br/>\nand I am rueing the day I sold the Crested Spaulders (AC 11, +6 stamina) I<br/>\nhad bought for *80pp* of a hurried fellow in Freeport bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaist:<br/>\nSticking with the Thick Leather Apron(AC 8), at 26 I figure the Thick Banded<br/>\nBelt:(AC 8, +15 strength) is a looong way away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrist:<br/>\nI have one Silver Plated Bracers (AC 7 +5 disease resistance, +5 poison<br/>\nresistance) I figure I need another. No real contenders here...<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons:<br/>\nFinally, to replace my Dragoon Dirk I will start looking for an Obsidian<br/>\nShard (Damage 6, Delay 25, Effect of Obsidian Shatter)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith jewlery this should dramatically raise my AC and keep my stats all<br/>\naround 100. Am I correct in thinking that this is the best approach at 26?<br/>\nAny hints on prices would be greatly appreciated, and would make a lot of<br/>\npeople on Povar happy because I wouldn&#39;t keep offering to trade them a 350pp<br/>\nitem for a 1-2Kpp item *laughs* criminy that is embarassing :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any replies, I greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Has there ever been any sort of mention why at level 26 you get both<br/>\nScreech and Instill Doubt? Was it just bad planning and they figured the<br/>\nlesser of all evils was to give them at the same level? Seems odd...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
