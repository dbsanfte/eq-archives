Heroes <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t bleed to<br/>\n&gt; death after being shot by an arrow from soem schlep goblin.  <br/>\n&gt; We ran into a<br/>\n&gt; some hige warlord, mega evil NPC.  Whats our plan to kill <br/>\n&gt; him?  Launch a<br/>\n&gt; small army of distempered  lizards into the castle, one of them will<br/>\n&gt; critical him and kill him...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In any case, I played Gemstone which was based on Rolemaster, <br/>\n&gt; its was a fun<br/>\n&gt; Mudd, so the system has merit when you have a computer to crunch the<br/>\n&gt; numbers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eGroups eLerts<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
