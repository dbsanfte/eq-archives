We had a buggy IG that<br/>\nwarped most of the way back to her lair, and then started summoning.  I<br/>\nhad not done melee damage or non-melee damage, or anything...all I was<br/>\nsinging the entire time since he had been pulled was mana song (I wish<br/>\nbusy trying to convince a cleric not too leave, so I was too distracted<br/>\nto twist).  The first person to be summoned was the bard that had tried<br/>\nto mez him (don&#39;t ask me), and then me...<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the resultant death was pretty comical, though...the other bard<br/>\nhad dragged him back out to one of the pits before he managed to kill<br/>\nher, so when he summoned me, he hit me once, and I fell into the<br/>\npit...where I took falling damage, was swiped once by a polar bear, and<br/>\nthen the IG decided I was too far away and summoned me again and hit me<br/>\nonce, and you get the picture :)  I /q&#39;d out, but it didn&#39;t save me. <br/>\nThat goes in my book as my all-time favorite death (well, only because I<br/>\ngot my res ;P)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
