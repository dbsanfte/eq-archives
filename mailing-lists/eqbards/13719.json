The numbers are:<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure on the first:    1/4<br/>\nSuccess/Failure:  3/4 times 1/3, or 1/4<br/>\nSuccess/Success:  3/4 times 2/3, or 1/2<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure on the first breaks down as:<br/>\nFailure/Success:  1/4 times 2/3, or 1/6<br/>\nFailure/Failure:  1/4 times 1/3, or 1/12<br/>\nThese add up to 3/12, or the 1/4 shown above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs required, these add up to 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n50/50 shot of failure.
