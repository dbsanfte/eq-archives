I just wait for a<br/>\n&gt; train, then when everyone has zoned, just charm the stuff into<br/>\n&gt; fighting each other.  Mortuary Fungi are the best because<br/>\n&gt; their Mort Drowsy basically renders all melee mobs impotent -<br/>\n&gt; even if your charm expires, the Mort Drowsy is still in effect<br/>\n&gt; and the melee mobs will get few if any hits in on you before<br/>\n&gt; you can recharm the Fungus.  Hags are good too, though a bit<br/>\n&gt; difficult to control.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
