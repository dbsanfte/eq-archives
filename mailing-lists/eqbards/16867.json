Someone asked me last night, upon telling him i made a SHD, &quot;Let&#39;s go <br/>\nhunt in Najena.&quot; Does medium sized bronze drop there off &lt;30 mobs? In <br/>\naddition, I&#39;d like to verify that SHD&#39;s do have class specific armor... is <br/>\nit the Darkforge? If so, I&#39;ll just look it up on a eqshadowknights page or <br/>\nsomething. No need to go into specifics, seeing this is a bard list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing... What&#39;s a good slasher i can camp for this poor little guy? <br/>\nDark Reaver is SHD only right? Is Pain Bringer WAR only? It sticks in my <br/>\nmind as such... Well ok.. Thank you all in advance for your advice and help. <br/>\nLook forward to seeing you on! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPava Rahti &lt;currently happy tagless&gt;<br/>\nBard of 30 measures<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
