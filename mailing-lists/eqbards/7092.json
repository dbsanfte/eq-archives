And<br/>\nafter level 14, there is a 15 level gap before an improvement.  The levels<br/>\njust before a spell upgrade are the hardest, as you are using spells from 14<br/>\nlevels ago.  I do believe that Clerics are positioned just about right for<br/>\nDD spells, as they do have better defence compared to all other pure<br/>\ncasters.  There are some sweet spots just after they get a new spell where<br/>\nthey can solo somewhat, but there are dead spots where they are very<br/>\nineffective with DD spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n[back to bards]<br/>\nHere was the original message I replied to:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a result, [hybrids] get magic<br/>\n&gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>\n&gt; other hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>\n&gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>\n&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, instead of arguing about the battle worthness of a Bard I should have<br/>\njust used your own argument against you.  The level 14 song was a pure<br/>\ncaster type song.  Only pure casters got the identify spell.  You felt that<br/>\nbards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>\nfrom all other classes without binding.  I mean MAJOR UPROAR.  So it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter what kind of Vulcan logic you use to argue that Bards need binding it<br/>\nwon&#39;t happen.  Putting BardBind in your petition will do no good at all, and<br/>\nprobably cause Verant to not fully consider the rest of your petition.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you need to ask for is to have all classes be able to bind anywhere (or<br/>\nmaybe just Inns) they choose instead of just a city.  Verant is much more<br/>\nlikely to consider something that would be fair to all classes, and not just<br/>\nfor Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
