Actually, you don&#39;t even have to click to pause it, <br/>\n&gt; you can just click done and come back.  But, once you log, you have <br/>\n&gt; to start a new game.  But why would multiplayer be pointless?  In my <br/>\n&gt; mind, they would just make it so you have to start a new game with <br/>\n&gt; another player so that both are starting fresh.  I think that it <br/>\n&gt; would be fun :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m glad that they added Gems.  I know a while back, many players <br/>\n&gt; were requesting casinos in towns so that they can gamble and play <br/>\n&gt; games.  They said that it would be too buggy and exploitable <br/>\n&gt; possibly, but I think that Gems (and other possible future games) is <br/>\n&gt; a good compromise.  The best things I can see about it are...  Camps <br/>\n&gt; will become much less boring, when you still have to stare at the <br/>\n&gt; spell books with pre-35 casters, waiting for group <br/>\n&gt; assignments/buffing on raids, etc.  Although, like you said.  People <br/>\n&gt; can die if they aren&#39;t paying attention and just playing Gems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Beatdrop<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Gordon Hughes&quot; &lt;ghughes@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can resume paused games at a later stage.  To pause, click on <br/>\n&gt; the game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; window, click &quot;done&quot; and go do something else.
