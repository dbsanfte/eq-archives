I am lv 27 and I cannot solo a carrion<br/>\nghoul in a straight melee fight, full plate or otherwise.  A friend of mine<br/>\nis a lv 24 ranger, wearing only chain, that can whoop up on a carrion ghoul,<br/>\nusing little or no magic.  I give almost the perfect illusion of being a<br/>\ntank.  You look at me, you see a wood elf, full plate, dual wielding combine<br/>\nlongswords.  First thing that comes to mind if you dont happen to see the<br/>\nblustering sparkles that pulse around my body every couple seconds is oh,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a warrior.  If we want to get even deeper into MY opinions (and why<br/>\nthe hell not eh?) I think we should be double attacking instead of dual<br/>\nwielding.  this would allow for much easier transitioning between weapon and<br/>\ninstrument, and would reinforce the light and airy bard impression that our<br/>\nHP already seems to warrent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I am not a flamer - I am genuinely interested in your side of the issue and<br/>\n&gt;am curious to hear the arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Slyde of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
