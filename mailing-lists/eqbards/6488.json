The debuff order seems to be from the most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-785790039\">Here are the results of my test last night:<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 40 song is a target dispel song.  It takes out one buff per tick.  The <br/>\ndebuff order seems to be from the most recently casted buff to the oldest <br/>\none.  It removed my lv 49 wizard&#39;s damage shield, skin, and hp buff in 3 <br/>\nticks.  It couldn&#39;t remove his ultravision however.  No text message, you <br/>\njust see a purple lightball on target like the graphic effect of chain song. <br/>\n  It was never resisted the many times I tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nChain song is fixed!  No more spending 10 min chasing down a green SoWed <br/>\nshaman!<br/>\n<br/>\nChain song on self will still break snare when the song effect is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nChain song on self will still break root, and when the song effect is over, <br/>\nyou move at normal rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new DoT change applies to our songs as well.  I tested the lv 48 CoC <br/>\nsong on 4 darkweed snakes.  For two of them, I stand still and play the song <br/>\nfor one hit.  Each time the snake would lose about 3/4 of its health after 3 <br/>\nticks.  The other 2 snakes, I play the song once and start to run away from <br/>\nit.  Each of those snake only lost about 1/2 hp after 3 ticks.  So that is <br/>\n33% decrease in damage as announced by Verant when the MOB is chasing <br/>\nsomeone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Pixie Strike song is faster than any Lv49 wizard DD spell.  I can <br/>\ninterrupted my friend almost everytime.  When hit, wizard spell damage never <br/>\nhit me for max damage.  Probably becuase of the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur songs has also been reduced in damage in PvP. Lv 48 song CoC (with lute) <br/>\nonly hit for about 100 damage in PvP.  Before the patch, it hit for 150 <br/>\ndamage in PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 48 CoC and Lv 2 CoD stacks.  With a lute, at level 48, they did over 200 <br/>\nAE damage in 3 ticks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
