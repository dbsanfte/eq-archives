Easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience is awarded by damage done, not position on the hate list, but<br/>\nwhen individuals (not groups) are attacking a mob those positions correspond<br/>\nto one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are arguably the best powerlevelers in the game for lower levels due<br/>\nto this.  Although I don&#39;t do this routinely I have done it for lower level<br/>\nguildmates once or twice when I happen across them and have some free time.<br/>\nEngage a critter with your lethal ninja-esque bard-melee to smack it down to<br/>\na sliver and then charm it.  When charm wears off it will be fixated on your<br/>\nand &quot;swish, swish&quot; try and hit you because the *damage* list has been<br/>\nerased, but the *hate* list has not.  Your lower level guy then knocks off<br/>\nthe sliver and gets the kill and the experience because the damage list has<br/>\nbe reset by your charm.  I say that we are arguably the best because when<br/>\nEnchanters do this same thing with damage/mem wipe combo there are two<br/>\ndrawbacks for them.  One, they use mana so you have to occassionally take a<br/>\nbreak and let them med.  And two, it&#39;s a lot easier for them to accidentally<br/>\nkill a lower level mob with a spell than for a bard will with weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis I have never done, but the way to KS with this song is the same.  The<br/>\ntheory is that you let a caster nuke a mob down to a sliver, charm it and<br/>\nwatch the caster cast on it once or twice more before he realizes that it&#39;s<br/>\ncharmed.  When it breaks charm, you kill it yourself and get the experience<br/>\nand loot, because again, the damage list is empty but the hate list is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n[50 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  So there I am, camping the lil Sarnak tower near the Frontier<br/>\n&gt; Mtns zone in<br/>\n&gt; Ill Omen.  About an hour and a half after I had arrived, I<br/>\n&gt; happened to spot<br/>\n&gt; this single Sarnak recruit *walking* (the emphasis will be explained in a<br/>\n&gt; sec) up to the base of the tower, and heading up the hill.  This<br/>\n&gt; was not too<br/>\n&gt; terribly long after a Sarnak train had passed by the same spot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Well, there I am, there is this strolling Sarnak... I&#39;m *hunting*<br/>\n&gt; Sarnaks... what luck, eh?  As i begin fighitng this lil bit of scrumptious<br/>\n&gt; exp, some lugnut named Synd comes up and tells me to pull my own spawns,<br/>\n&gt; then turns around and scurried off.<br/>\n&gt;     ???<br/>\n&gt;     As soon as I got done with the next Sarnak (the one that<br/>\n&gt; jumped me after<br/>\n&gt; the one I supposedly stole), I told him that the critter was walking,<br/>\n&gt; therefore seemed to be un-engaged, and I had no way of knowing that anyone<br/>\n&gt; had pulled it.  (If I had known, I certainly wouldn&#39;t have even bothered<br/>\n&gt; casting on it, I can find my own stuff to kill :oP )  He then proceeds to<br/>\n&gt; curse at me (which I reported... heeheehee) then tossed the big stunner at<br/>\n&gt; me: &quot;You are an infamous KSr.&quot;  I thought I was gonna hurt myself<br/>\n&gt; laughing!<br/>\n&gt; I told him that a bard KS&#39;r was just tooo funnny.  he then began<br/>\n&gt; telling me<br/>\n&gt; how his roomate has a level 51 bard, and we can use the charm song to KS,<br/>\n&gt; and there&#39;s a proc bug, yadda, yadda, yadda, etc, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I guess it didn;t matter that if I hadn;t broken the spawn,<br/>\n&gt; he wouldn;t<br/>\n&gt; have been able to pull in the first place, or that if his critter wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; acting in an engaged-type manner (actually, it looked like it was just<br/>\n&gt; returning from that earlier train), then it&#39;s hardly fair to say that<br/>\n&gt; someone &quot;stole&quot; it from you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I told him that the charm, to my knowledge, has never been<br/>\n&gt; able to wipe<br/>\n&gt; the hate list.  I didn&#39;t bother to remind him that exp awarded isn&#39;t based<br/>\n&gt; on hate list anymore, but on damage done.  His arguementative response was<br/>\n&gt; something along the lines of &quot;you should know more about the class you<br/>\n&gt; play&quot;... Hmmm... can&#39;t be much of a KSr if I don&#39;t know diddly about my<br/>\n&gt; class, now can I?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I just thought the rest of you would get a real kick out of<br/>\n&gt; knowing that<br/>\n&gt; bards (at least in some folks&#39; eyes) are the &quot;best KSrs in the<br/>\n&gt; game&quot;.  Class<br/>\n&gt; envy, gotta love it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=B=-<br/>\n&gt; Barrd Talespinner<br/>\n&gt; 31 on The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Infamous KSr&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
