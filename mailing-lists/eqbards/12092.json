Also, the faction hit isn&#39;t particularly<br/>\nimportant.  I killed the renegade Trumpy many times and am still only<br/>\ndubious to the corrupt guards.  Since I don&#39;t want to have anything to do<br/>\nwith the corrupt guards anyhow, that&#39;s a plus in my book.

Trumpy hangs around in one of<br/>\nthe buildings close to the docks.

If that person manages to get on the boat, he will<br/>\nswim after them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>\nis not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.  <br/>\nRepairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>\nenough (visit Blackburrow).
