The icey is about a bub more hp than either me or my friend and<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s hitting on me.  My friends hp drops a half a bub lower than mine. And<br/>\n&gt;we are both real low.  So, I decided to gamble and equip my lute - I <br/>\n&gt;already<br/>\n&gt;am trying desparately to keep the song going between interupts.  The<br/>\n&gt;icey-boney keeps hitting on me and finally slays me.

But this would have been a great place to use <br/>\nKelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (I know you are two levels away from it &lt;grin&gt;), here <br/>\nis a little story about how this song saved me and my parties butts in a big <br/>\nway.  We were deep in Najena taking on one of the goblin camps in there.  <br/>\nWell the opening blast from the goblin casters shreded us pretty good.  <br/>\nEvery one in the party was down below half health and one of our rangers was <br/>\nalready dead.  In desperation I equiped my lute and started playing the <br/>\nLullaby.  I immediately started directing the battle getting everyone to <br/>\nfocus on one goblin at a time, all the while keeping the Lullaby going. Our <br/>\npaladin starts to fade out of the battle (no red showing on his health bar <br/>\nand lay on hands was already been used on me) so I hit him with my squad <br/>\nring to give him a chance to cast a heal or two on himself.  All the while I <br/>\nam on the edge of my seat sweating bullets, the goblins are falling one by <br/>\none, the party is rotating damage, everyone is down to 1 1/2 bubbles.  One <br/>\ngoblin left and the whole party is down to one bubble or less, I switch to <br/>\nhealing to keep up going for the final push, and the final lone goblin <br/>\nfalls. Man what a battle! Other then the one ranger that fell at the <br/>\nbegining we are all alive (barely). One of the best battles I have ever been <br/>\nin :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
