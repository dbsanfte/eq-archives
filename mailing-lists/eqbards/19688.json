I really laughed at Abashi&#39;s suggestion that<br/>\nsometimes bards needed to back out of combat or stop singing.  Half the time<br/>\nI would be killed before I hit the mob!  By the time it was apparent I<br/>\nshould back out there was no power on Norrath capable of getting the mob off<br/>\nme short of an Ice Comet.  Back off and stop singing hah!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have charm I can taunt any mob off anyone.  I even taunted one<br/>\noff a ranger who was down to 7hps.  The giant proceeded to beat me down to 2<br/>\nbubbles while the ranger happily smacked away knowing that even in his<br/>\ncondition the mob was stuck on me for the duration.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;cringe!&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what happens when someone takes pity on me and invites me to group:<br/>\n1) They attack mob 2) I get within agro radius and put my hand near<br/>\nauto-attack key 3) mob turns on me and knocks me down to 80% heath 4) I<br/>\nscream &quot;Get it off&quot; 5) mob gets me down to 40% health and refuses to turn<br/>\naround  6) Groupmate hits mob with everything they&#39;ve got (or attempts to<br/>\nheal me) 7) LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps when I hit higher levels some class somewhere will be able to taunt<br/>\na mob off me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nMead, outlaw of 12 convictions, Tunare<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
