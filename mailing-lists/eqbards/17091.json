I think that it was Verant&#39;s original intention to make these<br/>\nstats have an effect on player skills.  Else, why would they have them on<br/>\nchar building screens and give you the ability to allocate bonus points.<br/>\nAlso,  why would they have so many items with agi +3, dex +3, etc.  But in<br/>\nthe end, in the world of Norrath that we know, level is god, ac is king,<br/>\nresists are you best friends and when your skills are maxed, agi, dex and<br/>\nstr are pretty meaningless beyond a decent base.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, given that, what good are songs that buff agi, dex and str?  The intent<br/>\nis there but the execution is lacking.  If str actually did something - woo<br/>\nhoo!  Chant and Anthem and Berzerker would be those awesome buffs you note<br/>\nthe lack of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 11:23 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bards abilities redefined was: Attack speedups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Okies, I&#39;ll go for it.  I&#39;ll use Verant&#39;s general idea of a bard as a<br/>\nstart<br/>\n&gt; though, don&#39;t want to start that whole why the heck can we wear plate<br/>\n&gt; argument again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Primary: Group buffs<br/>\n&gt; Secondary: Melee<br/>\n&gt; Tertiary: everything else<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why don&#39;t I think this is true currently?  Because Verant overvalues the<br/>\n&gt; fact that our songs do not require mana.  To make it true would require<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; to realize their error.  We should be able to group buff a party at 5<br/>\nlevels<br/>\n&gt; or so below what the other buffers can do to make it truly a primary<br/>\n&gt; ability.  Currently many of our buffs are so far behind the equivalent<br/>\nbuffs<br/>\n&gt; from other classes that unless the fighting is continuous it is better for<br/>\n&gt; the other classes to buff up and med. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
