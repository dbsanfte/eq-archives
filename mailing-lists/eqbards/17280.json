But NVidia has a new<br/>\nchip based on the GeForce chip called the NV15.  It&#39;s not live yet but it&#39;s<br/>\nprojected for release either late summer or early fall.  The chip is,<br/>\ncurrently, roughly 2-4x faster than the GeForce.  Impressive technology to<br/>\nsay the least.  I use a TNT2 Ultra with a PIII 550.  The special graphics<br/>\ncomponents of the PIII chipset do help with video a great deal (and in some<br/>\nways fill in for the lack of the GeForce card) which is why I&#39;m holding out<br/>\nfor the NV15.  For $200-$300 I expect a lot more performane enhancment than<br/>\nI will get from a GeForce.  On a PIII 550 the increase is there, but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot really worth $300 bucks ;)  On a non PIII system (ie:  Without Intel&#39;s<br/>\ngraphics architecture introduced on the PIII chip) the GeForce is a<br/>\nsignificant improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some really awesome sites out there that detail the pro&#39;s and<br/>\ncon&#39;s of the GeForce card.  It&#39;s a GREAT card on ANY system.  It&#39;s just not<br/>\n$300 great to me (I&#39;ll wait for the next gen cards coming out later this<br/>\nyear ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes:  EQ&#39;s performance (once you&#39;re past a certain processor speed) is<br/>\nentirely handled by the Video card (and any video boost from the processor).<br/>\nSound affects it as well though.  The game is faster if you turn off sound<br/>\neffects and knock realism back to 0.  But it is REALLY boring without sound<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKev aka Lyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
