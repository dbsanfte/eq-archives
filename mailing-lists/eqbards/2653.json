I was similarly pleased when i found out i can<br/>\ncharm a party member back into the group if he gets charmed. I was very<br/>\nunhappy to find out however that levitate, underwater breathing, and<br/>\naccelerando are over half the time useless in a group situation. All these<br/>\nsongs do nothing more than get everybody pissed at me because i just<br/>\ncanceled their sow or broke their journeyman boots. And Quellious help me<br/>\nif i turn on levitate. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese songs are rendered basically useless in a group setting because of<br/>\nhow they cancel their equivelent spell effects. So my question is, is this<br/>\na bug or a feature? I am torn between wanting to be able to cancel roots<br/>\nand not cancel sow&#39;s. Ideally i would like to be able cancel roots and not<br/>\nscrew up a sow. Either way i would love to hear an official answer. The<br/>\nwhole spell stacking/canceling issue seems to still be fubard, for instance<br/>\ni cant use the mask of the deciever to turn into a dark elf while a song is<br/>\nplaying. And if a song happens to be playing while the mask effect wears<br/>\noff my songs lock up and i cant change or stop or start a song unless i<br/>\ncamp out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
