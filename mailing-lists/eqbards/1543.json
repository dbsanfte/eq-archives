That&#39;s surprising. I&#39;m merely a level 5 bard, who has just learned<br/>\nSelo and how to play the drums. I know that it makes a change to the effect.<br/>\n(As well as chant of battle if I remember...) I have learned to greatly<br/>\nappreciate Selo and my little hand drum, as I used it to run from a pair of<br/>\norc raiders that jumped me last night. It seems that the drum is not<br/>\nnecessary to run from mummies though (hehe...) I ran and ran and ran to the<br/>\nguard. I stopped, turned around, and could just barely see the mummy heading<br/>\nmy way. Needless to say, the mummy did not get me. Sadly, though, Selo was<br/>\nnot enough speed to run from a Shadow Wolf. Which poses a question...As you<br/>\nget better at Percussion, do you get faster? Does the same apply to singing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: A.Rubman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 04, 1999 13:36<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Sad Encounter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;A.Rubman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a level 12 Bard, and I&#39;m quite happy. I know what my songs do, have<br/>\n&gt; 1 piece of banded, just learnt bellows and have 12 plat saved in the<br/>\n&gt; bank. I think I&#39;m doing ok. Last night I died in freeport and was in<br/>\n&gt; faydark asking if any bard could spare a drum for me to use. A level 18<br/>\n&gt; bard, asked me what I used the drum for...I was a bit confused, but<br/>\n&gt; thinking this was some test, I responded to run faster with selo&#39;s. She<br/>\n&gt; then proceeded to argue with me that the drum did nothing to help you<br/>\n&gt; and that Selo&#39;s was a singing song. After 5 minutes of that she tried<br/>\n&gt; it, and said &quot;oh wow, you&#39;re right&quot;. I&#39;m just curious, have other people<br/>\n&gt; met bards like this? I thought from personal experience and reading this<br/>\n&gt; list that we have some of the most inteligent people, but now I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; begining to wonder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Luini from Innoruk-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is THE place where the world talks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
