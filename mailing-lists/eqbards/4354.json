I have<br/>\n&gt; personally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and unrest.<br/>\n&gt; When I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you can see<br/>\n&gt; quite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the distance<br/>\n&gt; beelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>\n&gt; Thank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has happened<br/>\n&gt; to me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group attacking<br/>\n&gt; anything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>\n&gt; medding nukers and beeline for the bard.

But you prolly need to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started a train.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Selos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and attacks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of the 18th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a.k.a.
