The drag won <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevikazzam@...\">Kevikazzam@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n    Went on my first dragon raid tonight. Well it didn&#39;t go well, we had a <br/>\ngood plan and high hopes. But to no avale we got wrecked like it was our<br/>\njob. <br/>\n Got in a group with 3 tanks , 2 clerics , and me. we ran in , got under<br/>\nnags <br/>\n. I played Guard/ Elem like i learned on this list. Well , my connection <br/>\ncraps out. i Die , everyone else gets nailed, but not before almost killin <br/>\nthe damned thing. So it was disappointing but not too bad. .....but it ain&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\nover for this bard. I run back to solb , and join lots of naked adventurers <br/>\nimpatient to get back to their corpses. we walked to the bat room and wait <br/>\nfor a bit. Some jackass jumps the gun and pulls a full stone room.  I try to<br/>\n<br/>\nfear to save lives. and i did ...except my own. back in Freeport I sit on my<br/>\n<br/>\nduff and wonder if i should continue or not, i decided to wait and see. A <br/>\nminute later i am being ressed by a lvl 50 and i get most of my exp back. I <br/>\nget my hope renewed and decide to stick it out, i mean i have a couple of <br/>\nhours to get that other corpse res&#39;d. Well, we spend like an hour while <br/>\npeople try to drag corpses from under nags, then a while trying to<br/>\nreorganize <br/>\nand regroup. &lt;&lt;Mind you there are still a bunch of corpses unrecovered.&gt;&gt; <br/>\nBefore i know it , people start dropping like fly&#39;s , gating , going to bed,<br/>\n<br/>\netc...   I&#39;m tired so i decide to get a druid gate me and a 50 cleric to<br/>\nlava <br/>\n, go to solb and get my other res. We go back , and my corpse is gone! Now <br/>\nhere&#39;s the real kicker, I&#39;m lvl 46 . I lost a bub and a half of exp in all !<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with the hours i can play and zones so overcrowded , getting that exp <br/>\nback will be like going through 45. This story really has no point. I just <br/>\nwanted to vent. I&#39;m going to get 47 by next week &lt;&lt; I hope &gt;&gt;  and also i&#39;ll<br/>\n<br/>\nhave a better connection. So I haven&#39;t given up, just beat down hehe....<br/>\nFeel <br/>\nfree to comment . <br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firesong <br/>\nlvl 46 bard of tunare ( from 3 bubs to 1.5 )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
