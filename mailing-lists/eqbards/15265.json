As a<br/>\nprogrammer - I am often surprised when a user tells me of a &quot;new bug&quot; in<br/>\ncode that I know I haven&#39;t touched since the application was installed many<br/>\nmonths before.  My gut reaction is that the user is making a mistake not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat often is the case - is the data changed - or the users started using a<br/>\nseemingly unrelated feature of the application where the interaction exposed<br/>\nthe bug that never was exposed before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see GZ and company chuckling to themselves; they know they haven&#39;t<br/>\ntouched that code - why would it not work?<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby sure worked great for me back when I was a in my teens and lower<br/>\ntwenties - so I assumed the change was from a patch; not the simple fact<br/>\nthat I&#39;m level 36...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 22, 2000 4:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] New Lullaby theory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This theory came up on the concert hall board.  A bard there<br/>\n&gt; claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>\n&gt; when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>\n&gt; bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>\n&gt; the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>\n&gt; you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>\n&gt; level mob.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
