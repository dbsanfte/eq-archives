The forager","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1806368462\">I have extensively hunted the forager and hunter spawns.  The hunter USUALLY<br/>\nspawns in the local of a small tower directly out from the EJ zone.  The<br/>\nforager spawns near some large ruins along the river out from the swamp<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil the tracking changes are completed...the easiest way to initially<br/>\npickup either the forager or the hunter on track is to use a druid, and next<br/>\nbest case a bard.  Druids have a reduced range of tracking and are most<br/>\nlikely to see the forager or hunter on their &quot;radar&quot; in the more densely<br/>\npopulated areas.  Once either the forager or hunter are killed once...a<br/>\nranger, bard or druid can pull them easily, as they show at the top of<br/>\ntrack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, the forager and hunter NEVER have a mundane placeholder.<br/>\nIt is either them or a rare spawn, which spawns immediately after the<br/>\nprevious mob is killed.  I have also noticed that sometimes the forager or<br/>\nhunter spawns far away from their normal spawn points..down near the<br/>\nentrance to the undead city that holds the Sebilis entrance. Very rarely I<br/>\nhave also seen two foragers or hunters on track as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertoxx<br/>\n55 Troubadour<br/>\nGuild Leader, Defenders of Aleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
