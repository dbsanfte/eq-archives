U know if sneak is working if u start walking half <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;your walk speed.  The sneak skill at high lvl like in the 80&#39;s or higher<br/>\n&gt;will allow u to sneak by many creatures of yellows and down.  I would not<br/>\n&gt;try it against a red though.  The chances of not being seen is slim.  The<br/>\n&gt;sneak skill is very useful for retrieving your dead body and Pick pocketing<br/>\n&gt;but since we do not have it then it is mostly good for retrieving your <br/>\n&gt;body.<br/>\n&gt;With our speed song we can just run by all creatures.  Who need to sneak?  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;hoped this help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>\n&gt;Hammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Basil Eckert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athelas@...\">athelas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 12:43 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Sneak<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Basil Eckert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athelas@...\">athelas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail fellow Bards!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would be really glad if anyone could explain me the use of the sneak<br/>\n&gt;skill. I haven&#39;t seen one person in the game who could explain me how it<br/>\n&gt;works<br/>\n&gt;and what it really does. It is said that monsters can&#39;t hear you when your<br/>\n&gt;sneaking, but I really doubt that this is very usefull. I don&#39;t know either<br/>\n&gt;how to use it correctly. Do you have to be in walk mode to start sneaking?<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes I just can&#39;t hit the sneak button for hours, i don&#39;t know why.<br/>\n&gt;I would really appreciate every kind of help...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Athelas<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr, lv 18<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, You get it at 17...by the time you might have it maxed I figure you <br/>\nmight as well use Shari&#39;s Sonorous Clouding (I think it&#39;s Shari&#39;s?), which <br/>\nyou get shortly after. Unless of course the mobs you are passing can see <br/>\ninvisible. I found that Sonorous Clouding is one of the coolest methods of <br/>\nretrieving your own corpse as well as party members&#39; corpses because, as <br/>\nmost of us know, you become visible when looting. On the very next tick of <br/>\nthe song you become invisible again. We used this to get a friend&#39;s corpse <br/>\nwho was pulling mobs for us from deep within the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. <br/>\nHe got lost in the maze (he went through the first door to the right in the <br/>\ncourtyard) and was gangbanged by sentinels and defenders. He was worried he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get all of his gear back, but we laid those fears to rest in short <br/>\norder. It is also great for resting your party in a hostile area.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
