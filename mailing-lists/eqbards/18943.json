You seem to think that I expect the guild to<br/>\nwork for me, and I suppose in a way that is true, just as they expect me to<br/>\nwork for the guild.

I&#39;ve helped my guild on many, many raids and planer trips and died<br/>\ncountless times helping my guildmates retrieve corpses and overcome<br/>\nobstacles for fun and for loot.  If those had been Cobalt boots I would have<br/>\noffered them to a guild warrior rather than /auction&#39;ing them off for 5k.

Try and get into a cooperative, team-spirited<br/>\n&gt; guild.  I logged on last night and had two different guildmates send<br/>\n&gt; me tells saying they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still<br/>\n&gt; needed them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would never join a guild for the sole reason of getting nice items<br/>\n&gt; for free.  I have nothing against people helping other people out,<br/>\n&gt; but I believe there&#39;s a lot to be said for being able to acquire my<br/>\n&gt; equipment by my own means.  Singing Steel Boots aside (which I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned I received as a gift), the only other item I have which I<br/>\n&gt; did not a) loot, b) buy, or c) trade for myself is an EB BP and I<br/>\n&gt; feel I&#39;ve been pretty well equipped throughout the life of my Bard.<br/>\n&gt; When I received the BP as a wedding present, I was capable of gaining<br/>\n&gt; it myself by a), b) or c).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I see my guild more as a means to help me get to the places to<br/>\n&gt; acquire equipment rather than a guild that will take all of the work<br/>\n&gt; out of it.  I don&#39;t mind twinking (my level 10 Shaman has almost full<br/>\n&gt; Totemic), but I still take some pride in having acquired that<br/>\n&gt; equipment myself in another character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have seen and heard of far too many guilds, for my taste, where<br/>\n&gt; people join for the sole purpose of getting twinked.  Level 10<br/>\n&gt; characters join and demand &quot;phat lewt&quot; or they threaten to quit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m more of a &quot;loner&quot; or maybe, even tho I have given away many<br/>\n&gt; items to people, I don&#39;t want to feel obligated to reciprocate every<br/>\n&gt; time I get something of value on my own.  But, whichever reason, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; definitely prefer to purchase, trade, or loot the Singing Steel<br/>\n&gt; Gaunts on my own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
