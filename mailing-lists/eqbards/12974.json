In an outdoor<br/>\nzone you have your speed song, which should prevent amost ANY death.<br/>\nIndoors, if you cannot find a spot near the zone to fight at, then<br/>\nmake sure you group with a wizard or a druid thats knows how to evac.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general rule is ANYONE in the group can call for an <br/>\nevac, and the evac&#39;er immediately and without questioning would evac.<br/>\nFigure out later if it was the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you have a balanced group.<br/>\nClerics have about 7x the healing power of druids/shamans.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a cleric in the group, play &quot;less efficiently&quot;<br/>\nso that you do not attract attention, if this means just bellowing<br/>\nstraight, then do it and don&#39;t worry about it.  A dead bard is of<br/>\nno help to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nA warrior is the best taunting melee in the game.  A rogue BS does<br/>\ngood...when it does good damage.  A monk is fair, when he gets a lucky<br/>\nround of hits..A warrior just flat taunts.  If you don&#39;t have one of<br/>\nthese -- be more careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers/Druids/Shamans usually think of healing as a secondary priority.<br/>\nPaladins that stand around after combat also think of any<br/>\nheals they have as extra&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch your group, watch the spells being cast.  If the druid is<br/>\nputting Damage shield up every fight on both himself and the<br/>\nmain tank, and casting the swarm and snare, he likely isn&#39;t<br/>\nsaving mana to do major healing.  If the shaman is keeping<br/>\nspeed buffs up on everyone and casting dex/agi buffs all<br/>\naround, he isn&#39;t saving for major healing either.  If the cleric,<br/>\nthinks smite is the best form of DD in the game (run!) then<br/>\num, no healing there either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you join a group with a druid/cleric and they do not immediately<br/>\ncast skin like xxx or bravery/valor/resolution on everyone ...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any single fight, &quot;normal&quot; fight takes the group over half way<br/>\ndown in hp and mana, that is too hard of a source of experience,<br/>\nand you are going to find yourself dieing a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all of these statements are true, but they give you some<br/>\nthoughts on how to &quot;read&quot; a pickup group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI died 7 times from level 29 to level 50, it can be done.<br/>\n(I died 7 times last night breaking the plane of fear)<br/>\n<br/>\nRazzan<br/>\n50/49 Wizard posting on the wrong damn list again<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; run  sll the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>\n&gt; aswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp.

I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>\n&gt; think), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment.
