After the first zone crash<br/>\n&gt; in the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!) we had a guide helping us by<br/>\n&gt; ressurecting and recovering our corpses for us. He would summon us to our<br/>\n&gt; corpse in the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this was damn odd,<br/>\n&gt; because he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and was using his lvl 49 spell to do<br/>\n&gt; this. And he had to meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>\n&gt; before by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped away. Maybe this<br/>\n&gt; was just a freak occurance, i dont know, but he definately had his spells<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 50 bard<br/>\n&gt; Enoch Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; Tunare<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
