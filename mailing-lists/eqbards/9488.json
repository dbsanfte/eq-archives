You may say that<br/>\nfighting greens is not good use of time, but aviaks come in 2 main<br/>\nvarieties, that i can tell, the 18-19 version and the 20-21 version.<br/>\nthey basically spawn 50-50. So i was fighting a blue 75% of the time and<br/>\na green giving xp 25% of the time. Almost no down time also. And decent<br/>\nloot, up to a plat in coins, a rare bronze weapon and occasional word or<br/>\nrune.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
