I travel thru there <br/>\n&gt; regularly and<br/>\n&gt; was there last nite as well, no sign of unusual mobs.  Unlike <br/>\n&gt; Kithicor Q<br/>\n&gt; Hills appears to have been a singular event.  What concerns <br/>\n&gt; me more is the<br/>\n&gt; change to Paw and the trend you mentioned.  While its great <br/>\n&gt; for high level<br/>\n&gt; characters, what are the people who aren&#39;t high level <br/>\n&gt; supposed to do?  My<br/>\n&gt; guild has a whole group of six on its way to Paw now as its <br/>\n&gt; one of the few<br/>\n&gt; uncrowded places perfect for their levels.  If they really <br/>\n&gt; want upgrade a<br/>\n&gt; zone how about Kerra Isle?  It would be a month before word <br/>\n&gt; would even get<br/>\n&gt; out most likely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
