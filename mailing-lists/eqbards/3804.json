Oh ... right<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moment I was able to buy my lute/mandolin, I turned into a baker.<br/>\n Running around newbie fields with a stringed instrument has got to<br/>\nbe the best way to gather up those bat wings and rat ears!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, when I reached a bubble into level 9, I decided to take<br/>\nthe long trip to Innothule.  I&#39;ve heard that there are some newbie<br/>\nmonsters there with cool magic armor, and I wanted to see how my<br/>\nHeavy Metal Music does in Troll land.<br/>\n<br/>\nResults were pretty similar, except frogloks are a lot smarter than<br/>\nrats and bats -- they actually stay away when they&#39;re hurt, and they<br/>\nonly come back when they&#39;re half healed.  And running after the damn<br/>\nthings through swamplands is dangerous for a good-aligned character<br/>\nwho&#39;s nearest bind point is in Freeport (5 zones away).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I did use that interesting sit-down trick:  The moment a<br/>\nmonster starts to run away, don&#39;t chase after it.  Sit down.  Part of<br/>\nthe mob AI seems to think that characters sitting down are easy<br/>\ntargets.  The moment the mob hits you, you automatically stand up and<br/>\nautomatically target the attacker.  If you hit auto-attack fast<br/>\nenough, you&#39;ll get one or two hits in before the monster starts<br/>\nrunning again.  Repeat ad nauseum.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if this is an &quot;exploit&quot; or just plain tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since you wouldn&#39;t want to waste too much time killing newbie<br/>\nlunchmeat, use the dissonance to augment your attacks.  (Hey, I<br/>\nactually improved my hand to hand ... skill level 5!!!  WOW!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the lute of the gypsy princess or other loot-stringed items<br/>\nactually improve the performance of Dissonance??  And what are all<br/>\nthose &quot;Box of Lute Strings&quot; for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n_oO*  John Buenavides  *Oo_</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
