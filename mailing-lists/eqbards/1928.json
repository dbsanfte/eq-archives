I&#39;ll<br/>\npaint a gruesome picture for you - L19 Bard witha  group 18-21, I&#39;m in the<br/>\nUnrest mansion pulling red cons. You finally get a nice barbed for your group,<br/>\nsprint down the stairs ahead of the mob, click the door and...it doesn&#39;t open.<br/>\nNone of the doors...will open. As you frantically sprint about trying to find a<br/>\ndoor opened by someone else, to no avail, you eventually succumb. Theis happened<br/>\ntwice, although only the second time was I inside with a pull when I realized<br/>\nthe server had gone out of sync. The first time I had tried opening the door to<br/>\ngo in, couldn&#39;t, then turned around and noted 30+ people had all &quot;dissappeared&quot;.<br/>\nAlthough I camped, it of course locks up my computer and I have to either<br/>\nalt+tab out and force quit EverQuest or I have to force reboot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the boat issue, a friend and I came from Freeport, got off at the BB<br/>\ndock, but she crashed while experimenting with binding someone at the dock. She<br/>\nlogged back in on the boat going to Freeport. My guess is they changed the code<br/>\nto start you on the boat if you crash instead of in the water. It isn&#39;t common<br/>\nfor me, if I crash zoning, to end up several hundred yards from the zone either.<br/>\nOne time in Freeport I even started on top of the walls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope they nail down the cause of this soon, I petitioned a GM regarding<br/>\nthe Unrest issue after my second death realted to it, and he lauughed at me<br/>\nasking what I was doing there if I didn&#39;t know how to open doors (GM Bagash,<br/>\nKarana). Who says all EQ GMs aren&#39;t as arrogant and rude as a number of those<br/>\nfound in UO? *frowns*<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
