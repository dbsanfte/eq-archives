I think it&#39;s just the personality that is<br/>\n&gt; attracted to the barding class in the first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most named skins are used in quests - somewhere or other. That said - no,<br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t tailor with them - but they ARE the new &#39;secret&#39; ingredient in<br/>\n&gt; pottery for making poison vials. From what I&#39;ve read, just about any named<br/>\n&gt; animal skin is supposed to work for that - but I&#39;ve not done it myself -<br/>\n&gt; probably not scalps tho.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In tailoring, I know the basics of patchwork armor - ruined wolf, cat and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bear pelts. MQ or HQ pelts for backpacks and studded/reinforced armor,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there are some furs that I haven&#39;t seen a use for that I&#39;m curious if<br/>\nanyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;knows about. Black Wolf Fur (not ruined, med quality or high quality -<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt;black wolf fur) and Rat Fur. And how about Deathfist Pawn orc scalps? Can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tailors make anything with the above types of furs? Are there other furs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that can be used in tailoring? I have purchased the Tailoring book and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;how-to-sew books, but none of them mention the above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found that any nonrace meat (at least all I&#39;ve tried) can be made<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; sandwiches - and yes - a spit is exactly that, a portable oven. I&#39;ve NEVER<br/>\n&gt; BOTHERED WITH ANY TYPE OF BOOK - do some searches around the net - there<br/>\n&gt; are lots of sites that have receipes, brewing tips, pottery tips, smithing<br/>\n&gt; tips, etc. Most of these ARE the books - just transcribed to the web.<br/>\nBTW -<br/>\n&gt; beware these books - many have glaring errors which if you follow, are<br/>\n&gt; simply wrong and fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In baking, can any meat be mixed with bread to make sandwhiches? Is a<br/>\nspit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sort of like a portable oven? I&#39;ve purchased the first delicicies book<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just can&#39;t imagine buying 10 baking books for recipies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If anyone has any web pages that do a very good job of describing the<br/>\nabove<br/>\n&gt; &gt;two skills, I&#39;d very much appreciate it. My Bard is looking for<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d considered jewelry, but I believe it&#39;s just way too expensive. Tell<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are just a few sites (besides EQVault and Stratics of course) that<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; might find helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://member.aol.com/niamist/\">http://member.aol.com/niamist/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.gamestats.com/\">http://everquest.gamestats.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nyct.net/~bitsy/#recipes\">http://www.nyct.net/~bitsy/#recipes</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/\">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; For details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
