The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting is <br/>\nif a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would <br/>\nonly do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate, <br/>\nunless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and <br/>\ninstead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a challenge <br/>\n*gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you <br/>\nwill more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours, <br/>\ndepending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a <br/>\nlot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount <br/>\nof time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the <br/>\nfirst hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane <br/>\nopening.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the <br/>\nmost fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak. <br/>\nKiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if <br/>\nthis offends any of you, oh well):<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in <br/>\n[Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>\nKruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me [a shovel] <br/>\nand [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a [reward]!<br/>\nKruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat lewtz] with <br/>\nno risk other then [/random 100].<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n55th Bard, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Have to say was one of the most boring<br/>\n&gt;nights I&#39;ve ever had in Everquest.  The Plane had been broken early <br/>\n&gt;Saturday<br/>\n&gt;morning (I believe they said at 9:30 AM CDT) and I got there in <br/>\n&gt;anticipation<br/>\n&gt;of a respawn at approx 9:30 PM EDT.  I left at about 3:30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We saw maybe 2-3 dozen mobs over the course of about 5.5 hours camped there<br/>\n&gt;and no Bard stuff Dropped.  I was the only Bard - so it would have been <br/>\n&gt;nice<br/>\n&gt;if I got a couple of Imbrued.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone know any details of Respawns?   The folks there were expecting a<br/>\n&gt;major spawn at between 12-14 hours - but we saw nothing of the sort.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n&gt;Just Dinged to 48<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
