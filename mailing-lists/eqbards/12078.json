The participants wish to keep their names and the<br/>\nnames of their guilds anonymous due to ramifications of killing the Jolly<br/>\nOld Elf rumored to spawn in those zones. Who would want to kill such a well<br/>\nknown character who is known to give out gifts to all the newbies in<br/>\nNorrath?<br/>\n<br/>\nTruly a rare spawn, Ol&#39; Saint Nick, as he&#39;s called, only spawns once in<br/>\nevery 365 days. Typically, he kindly considers everybody regardless of class<br/>\nand race. Unfortunately rumors have formed about some truly magnificent loot<br/>\nthe elf dressed in red may be carrying and who wouldn&#39;t mind a small faction<br/>\nhit for some good loot. A red cloak which can shrink the person wearing it<br/>\nso they can fit even in places as small as a chimney! A large bag with<br/>\nunlimited slots which reduces the weight of everything in it to zero! Boots<br/>\nwhich allow the wearer to teleport anywhere in the world! Black gloves which<br/>\nallow the wearer to slow down time! All of the wearable items offer a<br/>\nsubstantial increase to cold resistance as well! I&#39;m almost tempted to sign<br/>\nup for this raid myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has heard of any weapons the elf might be carrying but he is usually<br/>\naccompanied by 8 horned creatures with incredible piercing abilities and who<br/>\ncan run at speeds on par with Spirit of Cheetah. Occasionally a ninth horned<br/>\nmob will accompany the elf. This other mob has a nose of fire. It is<br/>\nbelieved he drop the &#39;Globe of Fire&#39; which has unlimited charges of immolate<br/>\nand is usable in the off-hand!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a Christmas this may turn out to be!<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal Story By: TigerT Wyldfyre (The Rathe)<br/>\n<br/>\n==HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE==<br/>\n----==Brangwen Incantare==----</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
