Is it a useful song? I don&#39;t really like to sing<br/>\nAE songs in battle since it causes problems right quick - although I do like<br/>\nLargos as it has a pretty small radius. Are all of our good songs going to<br/>\nbe AE?

Had a warrior, a<br/>\n&gt; second bard, wizard, cleric and enchanter in the group.  I was weaving the<br/>\n&gt; three chants (with Selos drum) during every fight.  Based on the numbers<br/>\n&gt; posted on the www.eqsongs.com website, I was doing around 172pts of damage<br/>\n&gt; per tick (when all 3 stuck).  As many people have stated before on this<br/>\n&gt; list, this is a helluva lot more damage than I can do with weapons<br/>\nequipped.<br/>\n&gt; Like Minkin, I was doing so much damage to the mob that it almost always<br/>\n&gt; ignored the warrior and attacked me.  Still amazes me though when other<br/>\n&gt; classes ask me why I am not meleeing with weapons.  Even though the game<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; been out for almost two years, there are still a lot of people who don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; realize what all a bard can do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
