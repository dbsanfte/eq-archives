I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>\n&gt; &gt;someone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>\n&gt; that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>\n&gt; creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>\n&gt; dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>\n&gt; irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>\n&gt; get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>\n&gt; day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>\n&gt; that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>\n&gt; patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>\n&gt; today after this patch and see what happens...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You were grouped. :)  Our AE songs (thank goodness!) don&#39;t affect our party<br/>\nmembers.  Good thing -  if they did, I&#39;d be pretty much out of a job.  A great<br/>\nannoyance though is that AE songs do hurt party members pets, making it<br/>\nvery tricky to group with them.  Wouldn&#39;t it make sense that if our buff songs<br/>\ndon&#39;t help pets, our damage songs wouldn&#39;t hurt them?  :(  Ah well...<br/>\n<br/>\nLohengrin Windstrider<br/>\n    -bard of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
