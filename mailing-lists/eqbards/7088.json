I have seen<br/>\npeople playin this game with load times of 5 minutes, but how they do it I<br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine.  Those people actually have a far greater danger than you do<br/>\nand can often die trying to zone out of Grobb.  It isn&#39;t they won&#39;t live<br/>\nwith danger, its that for many the danger is far greater than for those who<br/>\nhave DSL or better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso for most the danger is intolerable because a guard can kill them in 4<br/>\nhits.  Many people don&#39;t go to Guk until they are far higher in level than<br/>\nwas really intended.  I haven&#39;t gotten too many trains there because the<br/>\nblue froggies don&#39;t run they fight me till they die.  Its easy to snare the<br/>\nfew that do run generally.  Convincing my groupmates who don&#39;t have<br/>\nAcellerando to go is very difficult though.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Frank Hartmann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FRANHART@...\">FRANHART@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 23, 1999 11:32 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: RE: RE: [eqbards] Why do the melee classes keep wanting<br/>\nBind?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Frank Hartmann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FRANHART@...\">FRANHART@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you&#39;ve had some bad experiences in Grobb. My condolences. The<br/>\n/quit does work, I have had to use it myself. My load times are fairly fast,<br/>\nso maybe that&#39;s the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still consider binding in evil cities an option. Others don&#39;t because they<br/>\nchoose not to play with that level of danger. That&#39;s alright, I respect<br/>\nthat. I just am tired of hearing melee classes whine that the ONLY way to<br/>\nfight in Cazic or Guk is to be bound in Freeport and that they hate the long<br/>\nrun back. It&#39;s not the ONLY way. It just may be the only way for some<br/>\nindividuals depending upon their danger tolerance level.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt; 09/23 10:44 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah that&#39;s a good one.  You don&#39;t get to hit /quit or any other command.<br/>\nYou die before you zone in on your client as you zone in on the server for a<br/>\nbit before you appear on the client side.  All you see is a never ending<br/>\nstream of Loading...Please wait messages. No command bar, no reports of<br/>\ndamage, no view of Grobb, nothing, period.  And your supposed safe spot may<br/>\nalso be the real spot for a guard that&#39;s been trained temporarily elsewhere<br/>\nwhich is worse if you don&#39;t know it.  He then returns to his spot every time<br/>\nthe server is reset, if he ever leaves it.  How do I know all this, there&#39;s<br/>\na lower level Kitasi on Solusek that was my first bard who listened to a<br/>\nmonk and got bound in Grobb.  Went from 12th to 9th before they lowered the<br/>\ndeath penalty before I realized it wasn&#39;t some glitch and reset my computer.<br/>\nNeedless to say he hasn&#39;t seen any action since as I moved to a server where<br/>\nI had friends who could bind.  Also only the time alive counts towards the<br/>\n30seconds.  The time passing thru the Loading period doesn&#39;t so you die<br/>\nhowever many times that guard can kill you before you react and cut the<br/>\nconnection plus the 30+ seconds of linkdead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of<br/>\nthese unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by<br/>\na guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This<br/>\nimmediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. You<br/>\nmay need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before<br/>\nreentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a<br/>\nmule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy territory.<br/>\nBut again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous. Everyone&#39;s<br/>\npersonal limit of danger varies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
