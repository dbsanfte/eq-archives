I used it to kite a few groups of beetles <br/>\n(from 4 to 6 at a time) in North Karana, and it worked just like always: run <br/>\nby the group, pulse Chords, run away and heal while their health drops <br/>\nsteadily.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, either Verant has not yet implemented the DoT &quot;advancing monster&quot; <br/>\nnonsense on the production servers, or they are not including bards (or at <br/>\nleast Chords of Dissonance) in this restriction (oh please oh please).  I&#39;d <br/>\nput my money on the former.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about you folks, but I have always thought that running into a <br/>\ngroup of nasties, pulsing Chords, and then running away playing a medley of <br/>\nHymn and Selo&#39;s was a very useful and viable tactic despite the danger (you <br/>\nWILL take damage when you go in to use Chords with most MOBs).  Now <br/>\napparently Verant is deciding it&#39;s an exploit.  Oh, I get it... it&#39;s a bug <br/>\nthat the monsters aren&#39;t as fast as us?  If they had better AI and tried to <br/>\nrun away instead of chasing us as we killed them, that would solve the <br/>\nproblem nicely... at least we&#39;d have a much harder time kiting groups, if <br/>\nthey split up.  On the other hand, it would be easier to kite those single <br/>\nMOBs, as they&#39;d be running away giving us plenty of time to improve our <br/>\nmelee skills and sing them to death.  I see this an another excellent <br/>\nexample of Verant trying to limit the way we play the game without thinking <br/>\nthrough all the repercussions.  They want us to group, so every viable <br/>\nsoloing strategy will slowly be whittled away, regardless of the effects <br/>\nthese changes have on 1) the internal consistency (i.e. believability) of <br/>\nthe world, or 2) other perfectly &quot;legal&quot; actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay your feet ever be fleet,<br/>\nAnd your voices ever be sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
