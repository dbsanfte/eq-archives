Each time<br/>\nit pulses it gives your casters a &#39;burst&#39; of mana.  Multiple bards mean<br/>\nmultiple bursts, there is nothing to conflict with.<br/>\nWhenever we have to do a large CR (lots of rezzing) we group 2-3 bards with<br/>\nthe Clerics to speed up their mana recovery.

This came across last <br/>\nnight as I was grouped with another bard, which hasn&#39;t happened to me in a <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are 2 bards in the group and both are singing Chorus of Clarity, <br/>\nis mana recovered faster than if just 1 were singing it? I checked with <br/>\nsome bards logged on-line last night and received a &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; and a <br/>\n&quot;yes, most definitely&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the &quot;no&quot; answer came from a bard who didn&#39;t realize that Anthem <br/>\nde Arms was an Atk speed buff, and thought that Whistling Warsong buffed <br/>\nthe entire party. : ) Man, he needs to read Rokken&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\nClan Battlehammer<br/>\nBertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n@Backup- Protect and Access your data any time, any where on the net.<br/>\nTry @Backup FREE and recieve 300 points from mypoints.com Install now:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2345/10/_/451022/_/958062414/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2345/10/_/451022/_/958062414/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
