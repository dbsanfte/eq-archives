It was in the screenshot so I<br/>\nthought it was one of your groupmates. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on starting against blues.  I&#39;ve gotten good at using Selo&#39;s and<br/>\nChains to split mobs.  I slow one with chains and when it stops following<br/>\nIstop and kill the other, closer one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the advice I&#39;ll let ya all know how it goes.  I have<br/>\ndiscovered though that at 25 my all instrument attack is far weaker than my<br/>\nmelee.  Its probably because I have such a good primary weapon (Harpoon of<br/>\nthe Depths).  I cannot come close to defeating the mobs I beat with melee<br/>\nusing solely instruments.  The main problem is all the song drops from<br/>\nbashing.  In melee that doesn&#39;t hurt me much but in all instrument it&#39;s<br/>\nfatal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing I hate more than when running past a stupid skel 1/4th my level I<br/>\nget the &quot;bashed for 1, stunned, Selo&#39;s drops&quot;.

Now for fear chain stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, like vintage wine - all bard songs tend to get better with some<br/>\nage.  Song effect is tested against level difference - when you first get<br/>\nsongs - resists are high.  Also missed notes if the underlying skill is not<br/>\nmaxxed and screetch is brass - make sure your brass is maxxed to the level.<br/>\n<br/>\nScreetch when it sticks and does not end early lasts 3 ticks.  Ideally you<br/>\ncould:<br/>\n<br/>\nfear (mob runs)<br/>\nchain (mob slows)<br/>\nwarsong (you hasten)<br/>\n<br/>\nfear (mob runs)<br/>\nchain (mob slows)<br/>\nwarsong (you hasten)<br/>\n(rinse, repeat)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is feared, it does not hit you.  Come up behind a mob.  Fear it.  If<br/>\nyou fear does not stick on the first try, it will turn and hit you. Keep<br/>\nfearing it until it runs. Then chain it. Then buff yourself. Then right away<br/>\nfear it again. Or skip the buff and do fear/chain only and you will have a<br/>\nsecond try if fear is resisted once it sticks.  If you get a resist, keep<br/>\nfearing until it sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFresh songs with high resist rates can be painfull so try it on the weakest<br/>\nstuff you can find and expect it ti get better as you add levels.  I got<br/>\npoor results when I first got the song and put it away for many levels.<br/>\nThen in my mid-30&#39;s I tried it again and got excellent results.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to hook up with a ranger or a druid who can stick snare on<br/>\nthe mob.  Then you can fear until it sticks then melee buff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, find a good open area and pull your mobs here (if they are not<br/>\nthere already).  It&#39;s better to have them run over known safe ground that<br/>\nrun into places you are not sure of.  Also, you need to be very close to the<br/>\nmob.  Yes, it is AE but smaller radius than you may think and Kunark mobs<br/>\nhave large melee ranges - so you need to get up close and personal to play<br/>\nthe song.  That&#39;s why if you can start from behind and get fear in first,<br/>\nyou are one step ahead of things.  If you have to pull, then chain so they<br/>\nhit you slower while you try to stick that first fear on an agro mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and let us know how you fare,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 10, 2000 11:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Our two main weapons...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech...
