After 800 <br/>\n&gt; there seems to be<br/>\n&gt; a dramatic drop in the amount that you get hit.  With buffs it&#39;s even<br/>\n&gt; better.  Right now a level 50 warrior can get their AC to <br/>\n&gt; about 800 maybe<br/>\n&gt; 900 with items.  We can get ours to about the same.  With <br/>\n&gt; singing steel I<br/>\n&gt; will be able to get my AC (at 50th level) to over 900.  <br/>\n&gt; (Warriors may be<br/>\n&gt; able to break 1000 with theirs)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well at level 50 the only singing steel you can even think of getting are<br/>\ngloves and boots.  you probably know where legs come from and you won&#39;t be<br/>\ngetting those.  no one has even found the bracers, arms, helm, or especially<br/>\nthe breastplate, which could be a bitch to get even at 60.  going with as<br/>\nmuch AC as i can get, i am at 826AC at level 53.  i just won an RBB (have<br/>\nnot tried it on yet, have to get it from the current owner who just got a<br/>\nCoF) so that will give me a big boost over a 0 AC haste sash, and my defense<br/>\nis at 205 at level 53 and i don&#39;t think that is maxxed.  once i get the RBB<br/>\nand max defense i estimate i will be just over 840AC at level 53 in full<br/>\nimbrued and singing steel gloves (i can&#39;t wear the boots with the imbrued it<br/>\njust looks awful, and gloves look ok and have more AC than my imbrued).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now... the effects on the armor REALLY ticks me off. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same here, i agree with all you say about the bard, i don&#39;t think the AC is<br/>\ntoo low, etc etc etc.  i just disagree about how easy you think it is be a<br/>\nbard with 900AC.  quite an exaggeration.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L53 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
