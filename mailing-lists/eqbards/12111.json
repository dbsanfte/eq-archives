If you could <br/>\nanswer a few questions I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group wants to go to Lavastorm, does this mask get me through Nektulos <br/>\nunscathed? Can I sell in Neriak wearing it? We&#39;re all good races so there is <br/>\nsome concern about Nektulos and selling loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this is bard / rogue only, and supposedly a common drop in L Guk, I <br/>\nassume that it is just left on the mob pretty often now (on my server it&#39;s <br/>\nalmost always garbage). Because of this, I don&#39;t feel that it is horrible <br/>\ntwinking if a guildmate kills the mob for me (ok, a little twinking). BUT, I <br/>\nhave to go pick it up because it&#39;s no drop, right? Any advice on how a lvl <br/>\n12 bard can get in and out of L Guk, looting the mob?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n*******************************************************************<br/>\nYou wont be able to equip it yet...<br/>\nby Roxie  posted 12/21/99 2:29:07 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nA level 12 bard in my guild, maybe he is 14, cant remember, got one <br/>\nyesterday and it could not be equiped. Said he was not powerful enough or <br/>\nsomting like that. Not sure what the min level is now. I just got mine and <br/>\nim level 33.<br/>\n*******************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
