You know, it really wasn&#39;t THAT bad.  I just pushed<br/>\nthrough it by logging on every night and killing Bouncers with the same<br/>\ngroup in Oggok.  Yes it was boring but I did get through 45th in about 9<br/>\nevenings or so.  The last half bubble was the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk which<br/>\nis a pretty good place for experience as well (but hard to get into).  After<br/>\nhitting 46th it only took me about an hour to be over half a bubble in.  Ha.<br/>\nMy guild had almost completely cleared Fear that night so with only a half<br/>\nbubble into 46th I got to go see that.  I felt like a kid again with most<br/>\nthings conning red and me kinda cowering behind the others singing.  But<br/>\nwith a half bub in 46 and only one cleric in the zone you don&#39;t let an Amy<br/>\nhit you more than once or twice before backing off.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n[46 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [46 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ^^^^^^^^^ nice work.
