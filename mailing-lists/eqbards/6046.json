Tell them to learn how to click the Taunt<br/>\n&gt;button more.  A warrior can taunt _anything_.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, a warrior can taunt anything - but it might not work! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt works very well - especially a high level warrior&#39;s taunt - but it<br/>\ndoes not work in all situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you just did something to make the mob very upset (big damage spell,<br/>\nbig heal, charm, root, snare) it can be VERY hard to taunt it off.<br/>\n- If you are low on health and the mob smells a kill - it is almost<br/>\nimpossible to taunt them off<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to my bard I have a level 32 Ranger, and at this level my<br/>\nRanger&#39;s taunt is about the same as a warrior&#39;s of equal level. And I can<br/>\ntell you that, especially if the person&#39;s health is low, it can be VERY VERY<br/>\nhard to get the mob off of them. As a Ranger I resort to all kinds of<br/>\ntricks, like casting a flurry of spells (root, snare, ignite, swarm) which<br/>\ngenerally helps a LOT more than just a taunt to pull off a mob. In that<br/>\nrespect a warrior - who has ONLY taunt - can possibily be less effective<br/>\nthan a Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that if you want to get the mob off you, you also need to do some<br/>\nthings to help the tanks:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Stop doing whatever you were doing. (If you were casting an area effect<br/>\nsong which frenzied the mob onto you, STOP that song until the tank gets the<br/>\nmobs off you)<br/>\n2. Stop attacking or doing damage to the mob altogether. In most situations,<br/>\nif you are not about to die, a mob will forget about you in a few rounds if<br/>\nyou&#39;re not attacking and others are (though, if he&#39;s REALLY mad at you -<br/>\nlike if you charmed him - it might take a little longer.)<br/>\n3. Take a FEW steps back, and see if the mob turns. If he does not turn,<br/>\nthat means he&#39;s frenzied on you, and it could take a few rounds of no<br/>\nattacking on your part for the tanks to get him off you. Do NOT run away<br/>\nthough! If you run away you will force the tanks to chase after you and the<br/>\nmob, and the mob will go out of taunting range, and the tank needs to be<br/>\nVERY close to be able to taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps =)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrin d&#39;Allaney, 32 Rangerss on Bristlebane<br/>\nDaleia d&#39;Allaney, 9 Bard on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
