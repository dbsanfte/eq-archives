I plan to dual wield it with my <br/>\ndirk at 17 until/unless I get a tomohawk (I have about 100pp in the bank and <br/>\nam still saving up).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 1H blunt is currently 76 (the cap at level 16 is 85); I used a fine steel <br/>\nwarhammer for some levels to keep my blunt skill up, so I should be able to <br/>\ncap out pretty easily. My dex is currently 118, and the mace doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nproc much (but I didn&#39;t get it for the proc effect, anyway). Quick review:<br/>\n<br/>\nScreaming Mace:<br/>\n1H Blunt<br/>\nDamage: 8<br/>\nDelay: 35<br/>\nWeight: 8 (heavy!)<br/>\nEffect: Screaming Mace (Yaulp)<br/>\nDamage/Delay = 0.22857<br/>\n<br/>\nWas previously using Dragoon Dirk:<br/>\nPiercing<br/>\nDamage: 6<br/>\nDelay: 23<br/>\nWeight: 2.5<br/>\nDamage/Delay = 0.2609<br/>\n<br/>\n(The dirk has obviously been relegated to the ranged weapon slot, so I can <br/>\nstill get the +2 dex, +3 sv magic bonus.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing else, it&#39;ll be useful in fighting those pesky fire-shielded mobs <br/>\nin Lavastorm; I used to come out severely hurt from those fights because my <br/>\ndragoon dirk was so darn fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll definitely hang on to the screaming mace for a while, to cap out my 1H <br/>\nblunt skill, if nothing else. I was considering dual wielding a tomohawk and <br/>\nthe mace at 17, since I tend to do most of my hunting solo (Berserker <br/>\nStrength + Yaulp). Jaxan&#39;s Jig is currently one of my regularly memorized <br/>\nsongs anyway, so there haven&#39;t been any big changes to my songlist from <br/>\nswinging around that big ole heavy thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Juke</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
