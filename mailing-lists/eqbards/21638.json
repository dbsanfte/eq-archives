That said, i<br/>\nmoved away from kunark to solo some giants (where i&#39;m still getting tells<br/>\nwithout advertising asking if i want to group).  on a side note, i want to<br/>\nthank the people that posted stuff about rathe mountains here and there in<br/>\nthe past, I&#39;ve taken this info and put it to very good use. I have very<br/>\nlittle time lately to play, so i try to make the most of my time and thats<br/>\nexactly how i spend it, charming giants (which is a hell of alot funner then<br/>\na ridge group in dreadlands).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only is my xp actually moving fast in a hell level, but the cash is a<br/>\nbonus too. In only about 2 and half-3 hours or so, i now have 8 rubies on me<br/>\n(i buy them to drop the cash weight) and have gotten well over a bub of xp<br/>\n(which in a hell level means about 2-3 bubs normally). Im not a super charm<br/>\nkiter yet as some people are but im improving, and its sometimes hard to<br/>\nfind giants there when other groups are camping them.  Mind you i still can<br/>\ndrop 3-4 of them before they pull their second one.  Another thing that is<br/>\ngreat about them is they max lev at 37, which is same as our low lev charm<br/>\nsong so no need for mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, thanks for the suggestions to go kill the giants, and also thanks<br/>\nfor the suggestion on buying rubies with the cash and reselling afterwards<br/>\nat a loss of about 10-12pp per gem (big deal).<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nlev 40 and climbing<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Nothing quite as satisfying watching a 3 druid and a shaman group<br/>\nsitting there while you finish off a couple of giants.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Egelhof, Tobias <br/>\nSent: October 5, 2000 8:32 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] healsong vs manasong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhey all,<br/>\n<br/>\ni heared you talking about bards and their problems getting into groups just<br/>\nbefore the transformation into a manabattery at 32. i didnt have problems<br/>\nfinding a group but have been frequently asked for that song, finally made a<br/>\nhotkey &quot;/g i get manasong at lvl 32, sorry&quot; ;)<br/>\nthen i grouped with a shaman and noticed him losing health. i asked him and<br/>\nhe told me he was transforming hp into mana. hey, i thought, this turns<br/>\nhealsong into manasong! it worked out well of course.<br/>\ndo you have any experience with that? at wich level do shamans get this<br/>\nspell? can other classes do this as well (necros)? if yes it would be<br/>\ninteresting to see what is more effective, manasong or healsong while the<br/>\ncasters eat their legs.<br/>\nand then, try weaving heal and manasong with this tactic. should be very low<br/>\ndowntime for shamans this way.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers<br/>\nthony, 31 songs manasongless, the tribunal<br/>\ntobi, 7 songs, tholuxe paells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
