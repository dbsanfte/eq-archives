This leads me<br/>\n&gt;to speculate that IF it is true that the raider&#39;s cap has been changed to<br/>\n&gt;Halfling only, THEN it is likely that there may be 2 versions of it.  All<br/>\n&gt;speculation - but we should verify with info from players who have the cap<br/>\n&gt;now from before the patch and players who obtain it henceforth.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n??
