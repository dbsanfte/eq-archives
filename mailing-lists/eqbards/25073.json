I was asking the same <br/>\n&gt; question today on<br/>\n&gt; concerthall.  for some oddball reason our mez overwrites <br/>\n&gt; chanter mez. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had a few bored chanters/confused when I start CC. Was <br/>\n&gt; grouped with an old<br/>\n&gt; guildie from sol ro yesterday when I had to mez 4 at a time <br/>\n&gt; while they beat<br/>\n&gt; the 5th down and she was quite &quot;wow bards can do that?&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; rest of group<br/>\n&gt; was somewhat like that too.  I told her, I&#39;m not a manasong bard...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyways, here&#39;s the thread<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?t\">http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?t</a><br/>\n&gt; opicID=10171.t<br/>\n&gt; opic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: June 25, 2001 11:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQbards@yahoogroups.com\">EQbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] My fingers are numb...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Played Tani for most of the weekend, had a blast.  I&#39;ve spent <br/>\n&gt; most of my<br/>\n&gt; higher levels soloing or duoing, and this weekend, I ventured <br/>\n&gt; into Sebilis.<br/>\n&gt; Wow, what an education.  When we had a chanter, life was all fun... he<br/>\n&gt; slowed, messed and hasted.  I really didnt have to do any <br/>\n&gt; work but when I<br/>\n&gt; was the crowd control.. well, wow.. its really hard to mes <br/>\n&gt; things and then<br/>\n&gt; still fight the target mob.  I started to get the hang of it <br/>\n&gt; though and<br/>\n&gt; found outside views really help a lot.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; My question is, what is up with the 53 mez and chanter mez?  <br/>\n&gt; I found out the<br/>\n&gt; hard way (i.e. group death spree) that they don&#39;t seem to <br/>\n&gt; stack!?!  But my<br/>\n&gt; 53 mez seemed to overwrite the 59 chanter mez???!!! Whats up <br/>\n&gt; with that?  Am<br/>\n&gt; I wrong here?  What am I missing?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Tani, 53rd Bardette<br/>\n&gt; Halana, 60th Shammykins<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; P.S. Been a while, missed you all!
