I also only play him when my similiar level <br/>\n  friend is around.  SoW is too slow, mana constraints bite, melee<br/>\n  is much more horrible.  However, I can stroll into any place my <br/>\n  bard would go and in solo mode perform 3x or 4x better.  I actually<br/>\n  went from L16 to L17 all on my own soloing in one night.  It was<br/>\n  very refreshing.  Boring, but a change of pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My druid is almost L21 but I havent played him much because I love<br/>\n  my bard.  There are times when I&#39;d like to press a few buttons and<br/>\n  kill things quickly.  That was something my bard could never do.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  and Dagato Catnip!  lol...   hope you don&#39;t mind, Cat - it was pure<br/>\n                               admiration, not a lack of creativity.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
