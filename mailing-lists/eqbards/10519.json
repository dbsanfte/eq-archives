There is<br/>\n  definitely a trick to pulling things solo in there.  Especially<br/>\n  in the Maid and Butler room.  More people creates more confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My only options were to run or fight.  And if I did run, these <br/>\n  things would/could have happened:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) I run, Sog (now an npc with unlimited mana and range) nukes<br/>\n     me dead anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) I run, Davassi forces Sog to follow me, and then he breaks<br/>\n     charm in the middle of 10 deathly dingdongs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) I run, and myself get jumped by 10 deathly bitches.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4) I leave the room, and writhe in the grip of agony about<br/>\n     20 times.<br/>\n <br/>\n  5) I fight, and possiblely attract more attention from roamers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  6) I fight Sog, and still get nuked cause level 50 NPCs always<br/>\n     regain concentration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  7) I fight Sog, pixie strike him, 44 vs 50 (get resisted)<br/>\n<br/>\n  8) I Desperate Dirge Davassi, killing her and myself and<br/>\n     maybe Sog too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ... in a matter of seconds all that ran through my mind,<br/>\n  Starfire casting time is 6.2 seconds I believe.  I had <br/>\n  approximately 12.4 seconds to figure out my plans.  I <br/>\n  think I made the best choice.  I pulled a &#39;fearplane&#39;.<br/>\n  Get a loc, curl into a ball, and kiss your ass goodbye.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
