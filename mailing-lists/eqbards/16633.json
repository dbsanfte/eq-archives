Thanks all for the tips that helped<br/>\nmake it so.<br/>\nI learned several things last nite that might benefit other bards so I&#39;ll<br/>\npass them along.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, 1 bard is not a tank.  I know most people are aware of this point,<br/>\nbut the corresponding lesson was a bit surprising to me.  Apparently while 1<br/>\nbard is not a tank, 3 bards are 3 tanks.  Our group last night started out<br/>\nas 3 bards, a druid, an enchanter, and a necromancer.  Later we lost the<br/>\ndruid but replaced him with a battle cleric(I hate to use the word cleric<br/>\nwith this guy, healing is always his secondary motivation).  Both groups<br/>\nwere enormously successful.  The bards were able to tank very effectively,<br/>\nour taunt factors were close enough that merely stepping back caused the mob<br/>\nto immediately switch to the next &#39;target bard&#39; in place so we could<br/>\ndistribute damage well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 2.  A necromancer is as valuable in a group as any other caster,<br/>\nwithout his pet.  Our necromancer did not use a pet for 90% of the night in<br/>\norder to let the enchanter do his job more easily.  The enchanter was still<br/>\nvery effective.  On several occasions we had to get mobs off of him.  Not in<br/>\nmost fights, but definitely in some.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 3.  Lullaby is even more broken than I had pessimistically thought.<br/>\nThe enchanter was able to keep up to four extra white goblins mez&#39;d while<br/>\nthe group concentrated on one at a time on every occasion, without fail.  We<br/>\ncould not keep 1 extra blue goblin Nodded with two bards singing lullaby so<br/>\nthat it went off at different times.  It was pathetic to say the least.  We<br/>\ntried to Lullaby 1 extra goblin and were only able to succeed about 30% of<br/>\nthe time.  We were set up so that I would keep Lullaby out of my regular<br/>\nweave, being the lower level bard, and then if the other bard&#39;s Lullaby went<br/>\noff and the untargeted Goblin did not nod completely, I would immediately<br/>\nfire off my Lullaby.  It was a joke.  While the enchanter could have kept<br/>\nthat extra goblin mez&#39;d thru every fight of the entire night if we had<br/>\nwanted him to, we couldn&#39;t even keep it mez&#39;d long enough to finish off one<br/>\nof its fellows.  It was even worse when we first tried it with just one of<br/>\nus Lullabying.  We had to zone.  Not only was I unable to keep the 1 extra<br/>\ngoblin Nodded, but after about 4 tries nothing the other bard could do could<br/>\npossibly get either of the goblins off my back.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 4.  If you don&#39;t have fear, you can still reverse kite.  Just get two<br/>\nbards, have one fire up lullaby about four or five times.  Lullaby bard then<br/>\nflees from mob while second bards chains it.  Chaining bard can literally<br/>\nbeat the thing to death and it will never turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 5.  A competent enchanter can be a powerful force.  They can&#39;t really<br/>\nhelp you go after red mobs, but if you are facing a horde of whites/some<br/>\nyellows they are awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSol A has been great so far.  2 nights, 4 deaths and I still have 3.5<br/>\nbubbles to show for it!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
