That&#39;s now so ingrained I have trouble using my right.<br/>\nRecently it dawned on me I wasn&#39;t using the keypad, so I started remapping.<br/>\n First &quot;c&quot; went to the keypad 0 key.  Nice improvement.

The only<br/>\nother key I reach for while playing is Esc, and it&#39;s easy to hit off in its<br/>\ncorner.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying this way I shift my keyboard somewhat left so I&#39;m comfortable with<br/>\nleft hand on its right side and right hand on the mouse.  For general<br/>\ntyping I either reach across with both hands or roll my chair a little left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
