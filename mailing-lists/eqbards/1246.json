These are the<br/>\nkind that do damage to the attacker every time you&#39;re hit.<br/>\nSince bards often end up being the mob magnet, I was wondering<br/>\nif anyone had tried getting a druid to cast a couple of these<br/>\non you (there are two types - one low damage/long duration,<br/>\none high damage/short duration, both stack - cast the latter<br/>\njust as a fight starts).<br/>\n<br/>\nI just started using these with my L9 druid character, and I<br/>\ncan attack two or three blue mobs at once.  By the time I&#39;ve<br/>\nfinished the first, the other two are down to about half hp<br/>\njust from beating on me.  Of course, these are goblins who<br/>\ntend to be pretty wimpy fighters in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nA goblin HITS you for 1 point of damage<br/>\nA goblin is pierced by thorns<br/>\nA goblins says &quot;hit by 6 points non-melee damage&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLotsa fun watching them kill themselves.  :-)<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
