A few of you<br/>\nhave come up with some pretty good ideas so far.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will volunteer to consolidate all of the suggestions and prepare it for<br/>\nsubmission to Verant.  However, I am going on vacation tomorrow through 5<br/>\nDecember.  Because I will be gone so long, I am going to temporarily stop my<br/>\nsubscription to this list so I can avoid having my Inbox flooded with<br/>\nmessages.  So, unless someone else wants to volunteer to consolidate the<br/>\nsuggestions, I request that, in addition to posting your suggestion to this<br/>\nlist, you also send me a direct email.  My home email address is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bamadude@...\">bamadude@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be a complete waste of time if Verant completely ignores us but I<br/>\nthink its worth a shot.  If you send in a song idea, I suggest using your<br/>\nbards name as part of the song title.  If Verant uses your song idea, you<br/>\nmight get lucky and have your bard&#39;s name included as part of the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
