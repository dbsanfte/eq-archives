I could never trade<br/>\nmy tomhawk for a claw. The market isn&#39;t flooded with em on Solusek Ro,<br/>\nbut a tommy for a demon claw is something that wouldn&#39;t happen here. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even find a worthwhile trade for my tommy anywhere on antonica.<br/>\nAnychance the guy who you traded with has a seperate character on<br/>\nSolusek Ro I could trade with, cause I&#39;d be VERY happy to do business.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus DuPrey<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nCMai wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No it is not worth 500pp.  It is worth about 300pp.  This is the coolest<br/>\n&gt; weapon in the game for a bard.  Yesterday I traded my Tomahawk for the claw<br/>\n&gt; and I was doing more dmg than before because with Anthem and Warsong I was<br/>\n&gt; hitting with non stop.  To also answer earlier question as to which weapon<br/>\n&gt; is better: Tomahawk or Barbed whip?  Neither.  I would get a tomahawk then<br/>\n&gt; trade it for the claw.  One, it looks cool and it is a lot lighter than a<br/>\n&gt; Tomahawk and a lot faster too.  For a bard, speed is everything in this<br/>\n&gt; game.
