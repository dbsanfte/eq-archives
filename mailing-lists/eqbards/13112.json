I wish you were on Innoruuk - I would come help you.  Get one of the<br/>\n&gt; local oger/trolls to kill some lizards and use one of those flutes.  Not<br/>\n&gt; sure if any are sold in Ogg or Feer - prolly only if a hunter sold one to<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; merch.  You can get them from the gypsy merchants in Rathe Mts just past<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Inns on the way to the Lake Rathe zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CT is not a good place for level 19/20 - unless you work the courtyard and<br/>\n&gt; are ready to zone fast.  And the Maze is a bad place period. High 30&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt; even 40&#39;s can get agro&#39;d and have a pack of lizzie on them in no time -<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; to mention getting lost.  I hate that maze!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your best bet is to try to find a high level player to help you CR.  When<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; went there in my high 20&#39;s and low 30&#39;s stuff would see me.  My invis,<br/>\n&gt; other&#39;s invis, my bad luck - whatever - stuff would see me.  So, it&#39;s<br/>\ngonna<br/>\n&gt; be real tough for you to try to drag your self out - unless you are close<br/>\n&gt; and know the maze.

I<br/>\n&gt; went because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>\n&gt; him.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>\n&gt; then proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>\n&gt; now have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>\n&gt; somewhere in the maze.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I want to know is...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>\n&gt; to the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>\n&gt; by.
