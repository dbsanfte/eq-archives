Counters can get in the way.  You&#39;ll see a failure message (target is <br/>\ntoo far away?  target is not visible?  not sure, but you&#39;ll see one).  <br/>\nStand next to him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  It&#39;s a wind-based song, it will be better when you can use your flute <br/>\n(which you will really only be able to practice when you get underwater <br/>\nsong).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  It raises the /con level of the target, but it might not raise it <br/>\nenough to change the text.  Since I assume that it gets better with <br/>\nleveling, and you&#39;re low, this might be playing a part.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  It&#39;s possible for your charisma to be high enough that you already <br/>\nhave the best available price, and changing the /con won&#39;t make a <br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  It affects ALL members of a faction within the same zone at the time <br/>\nyou sing it, so once you&#39;ve done it to one merchant, you&#39;ve probably <br/>\nchanged the rest already (since, for the most part, they&#39;re all the same <br/>\nfaction).<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  If you sing it to a member of another faction, you lose your effect <br/>\nwith any previous faction you&#39;ve sung it to.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  It appears to last until you zone, although it&#39;s possible that it is <br/>\njust very long-lasting.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
