It s the same","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1817434089\">The reason for the charges is quite possible, but your final statement is flawed, &quot;..if no one charged, everyone would have a lot more money.&quot;  It&#39;s the same amount of money--different hands.  This economics is built into EQ.  Ever see a PC merchant just giving stuff away?  No, he sells wares to make money, as some decide to provide services for money.  Think of it the same way that McDonald&#39;s sells food (something tangible and physical) to Federal Express (a service, you are basically paying them to do something quickly that would be impossible or too time consuming to do yourself.)  People get their binds and corpse finds for free from their friends and acquantances anyway, so if someone wants to charge for a corpse find or a bind, hooray for them.  If the person doesn&#39;t want their services, they will find someone else to do it for them either cheaper or for free--same with any business.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: [eqbards] Re: Corpse relocation fee&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: Adam DeMarino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1999 16:40:41 -0100<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Adam DeMarino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe in requesting any type of pay.

Have you ever needed to be bound to a place?<br/>\n&gt; How much do most spellcasters charge for it, 5gp. Ever spellcaster that<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve met who charges has said they only do it because other mages do,<br/>\n&gt; and because necros and bards charge for finding corpses. Personally I<br/>\n&gt; believe if nobody charged everyone would have a lot more money.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talonus of Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jason_Sanderson@...\">Jason_Sanderson@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jason_Sanderson@...\">Jason_Sanderson@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hail!
