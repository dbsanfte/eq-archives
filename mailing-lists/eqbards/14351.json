I think that warriors taunt<br/>\n  better, enchanter crowd control better, etc.  and this is why<br/>\n  bard hate isn&#39;t a big issue late in the bard&#39;s life.  However,<br/>\n  if two clerics of innoruuk, a handful of spite golems, and the<br/>\n  occansional banshee decide to crash the party, I&#39;m the first <br/>\n  one popping back at my bind point. &lt;g&gt;  Same with ice giants in<br/>\n  permafrost: 2/3 giants, 2 spiders, and toss in a bear or terror<br/>\n  and you&#39;ve just killed your bard. hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ps, Got 2 Runed mithril bracers last night.

I would venture to guess that (and without saying<br/>\n  prices which fluctuate from server to server) both RMBs would most<br/>\n  likely be equivalent to half the worth of a falchion.  And maybe<br/>\n  a fourth the equivalence of a Yak.  I&#39;m just guessing, since people<br/>\n  rate their own worth on items and it varies person to person.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
