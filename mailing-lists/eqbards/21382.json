Here&#39;s how much my <br/>\nguild likes the Mana Song:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re in Plane of Sky.  We need Crowd Control, and only have one <br/>\nEnchanter, so our level 57 Bard logs onto her friends account to play his <br/>\nEnchanter.  So I play her Bard.  So my RL friend (a Cleric), logs <br/>\nKenross (52) onto his second computer, turns on Mana Song, and sets him <br/>\nto /follow the Cleric.  Kenross was in the pulling group, too, so he <br/>\nactually got exp from it.  With nobody running him.  And not one person <br/>\nraised even the smallest objection; this seemed perfectly acceptable.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ll never get fixed if Mana Song is THAT in demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, I got to spend the entire day (16 hours) twisting 32 and 55, <br/>\nto keep our only 96% rez Cleric, our two Enchanters, and our highest <br/>\nShaman pumped with Mana.  Except during CR, when I got to sing the <br/>\nsame two songs for five Clerics.  What fun.  The only excitement came <br/>\nwhen I got yelled at for not turning off 55 when the Enchanters wanted to <br/>\ncast C2 on the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a macro, I could have walked away and had a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what&#39;s with the Plane of Sky boss MOBs not dropping any loot?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 52 songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re right Adon.
