Then we get to this (only available in the print<br/>\nversion of the article): <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive,<br/>\nrelying instead on the expertise of his staff. &quot;No, we never talk to<br/>\nconsumers - they just fuck us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market<br/>\nresearch which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn&#39;t<br/>\ndone any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made.<br/>\nWe never focus on them. Gamers don&#39;t know what they want. We just want to<br/>\nknow if they have a valid credit card.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, hell. This explains a lot, doesn&#39;t it? No wonder customer service has<br/>\nsucked harder than a Vegas prostitute with an Electrolux attachment; the CEO<br/>\nof the bloody place thinks that we the customers will only fuck them up. <br/>\n<br/>\nEr... Smed? Smed? You wanna try and explain this to us in a way that us<br/>\nsilly shits can understand? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: September 25, 2001 12:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Stacking?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Verant is continuing to bat 1.000 on their changes to bard code -<br/>\nand can&#39;t implement it without introducing a major bug.
