You would be burning through mana at a faster rate, ensuring you <br/>\nwere OOM MUCH sooner (recharming every 10 seconds instead of 15).  <br/>\nIt&#39;s also not fool proof, resists or early breaks would be a problem <br/>\nbecause you&#39;d have to get into command range to direct your pet.  The <br/>\nonly way to really combat resists or early breaks would be to recharm <br/>\neven sooner, which would further speed up mana burn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I believe all other forms of charm are refreshable AND Bard <br/>\ncharm is refreshable on PVP servers.
