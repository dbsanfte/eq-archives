I am always pressed into service as a <br/>\n     tank.  Sigh.  And the couple of time I was in a group where it might <br/>\n     have worked everyone in the group though I was &#39;slacking&#39; by not <br/>\n     wanting to fight.  Not once have I been able to do this.  Maybe as I <br/>\n     get more circles I will have a chance. (assuming no one cuts me down)<br/>\n     So not all fighting Bards are selfish, just misunderstood and <br/>\n     overworked...<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold  17th <br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lea G&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keylimes@...\">keylimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nHail Fellow Bards,<br/>\n     <br/>\n[re: successful leveling]<br/>\nI advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage dealt, <br/>\nto review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more than <br/>\nseeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting. <br/>\nSHAME ON THAT BARD! If you the bard wants to utilize your talents most <br/>\nefficiently, group with 2 warriors (or a monk), 2 rogues, and 1 party member <br/>\nthat can do emergency heals. Stand back and play your heal with your lute, <br/>\ntwist whatever other song fits the occasion, and you can fight for hours and <br/>\nhours, gain &quot;circles of knowledge&quot; quite quickly. A healthy group prevails, <br/>\nso if you want to succeed and learn quickly, this is your best source. Use <br/>\nyour combat skills when soloing, or with weak groups, BUT always remember in <br/>\nlarge groups, you ARE NOT a tank or a fighter, you are a talented musician.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
