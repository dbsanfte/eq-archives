I was always under the impression that<br/>\nlambent stones could only be acquired by killing a giant or griffon.  Never<br/>\nknew you could buy them from NPCs.  Can someone list the known locations<br/>\nwhere NPCs sell them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>\n&gt; Lambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less<br/>\n&gt; two.<br/>\n&gt; I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>\n&gt; me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
