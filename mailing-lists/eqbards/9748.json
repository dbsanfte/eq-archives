I laughed in return and said good luck in getting more.  He said<br/>\nhis guildmates paid him 100pp apiece for the last two.  I told him they were<br/>\ncrazy and that I had even seen them at merchants for 47pp.  He said good<br/>\nluck getting one then and camped.  The very next nite I was given one by a<br/>\n38th level warrior who I healed up during the GM even in Greater Faydark.<br/>\nThe 39th level wizard he was grouped with offered me a dirk, but since I<br/>\nalready had one I declined.  I have found our healing ability, being<br/>\nnon-mana based, extremely useful for helping higher levels recover during<br/>\nand after GM quest events.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 2:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Value of lambent stones (was AC Dilemma)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing the same on E&#39;ci...I bought one for 20 plat and have<br/>\nseen them auctioned for 100+.
