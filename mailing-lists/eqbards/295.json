I was well clear when it awoke<br/>\nagain but it still came after me. Even a quick application of Lament while<br/>\nit nodded was not enough to stop it from chasing me down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI do know that the effect worked as you explain back in beta.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 26, 1999 8:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Kelin&#39;s Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things you have to remember with the lullaby are:<br/>\n<br/>\nb) This song only makes it forget that it&#39;s mad at you &quot;right now&quot;.  If<br/>\nyou are the sort of person that it gets mad at normally, and you&#39;re<br/>\nstill around when the song wears off, it will get mad at you again.  If<br/>\nit helps you anyway, think of it as waking up and thinking that it&#39;s<br/>\nattacking you for the first time again.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory, you should be able to start singing this song, put things<br/>\naround you to sleep, then run away quickly so that when they wake up,<br/>\nthey will have forgotten about you and go on their merry way.  In<br/>\npractice, not only for the reasons listed above, this is tricky to<br/>\nachieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYou can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\nfeature!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
