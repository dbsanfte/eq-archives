Our underwater breathing (UB) song does<br/>\nnot override Enduring Breath (EB).  If EB is up and you start singing UB, EB<br/>\nwill still be up when you stop singing.  However, if you are singing UB and<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have EB, EB will not stick if someone tries to cast it on you.<br/>\nYou have to stop UB first in order to get EB to stick.  While in Kedge, I<br/>\nalways have UB memmed.  Whenever someone announces EB is dropping, I get UB<br/>\nready in case they start drowning.  Saved a 50 paladin the other night<br/>\nbecause of it.  To say the least he was glad I had it ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nNote to Laluni:  I&#39;ll be in Kedge tonight around 9PM PST if I can get a ride<br/>\nfrom Ogguk.  Hope to see you and the rest of DoH there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Speaking of kedge... any of you know if our water breathing song overrides<br/>\n&gt; enduring breath?  In other<br/>\n&gt; words.  I&#39;d like to keep it memed in case of emergencies, but will it<br/>\n&gt; cause everyone else&#39;s enduring<br/>\n&gt; breath&#39;s do fade when the 10 seconds are up?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laluni Songhammer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
