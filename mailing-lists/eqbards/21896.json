The eq.castersrealm.com shaman forums<br/>\n(as well as Shaman&#39;s Curcible and I think another) occasionally have<br/>\nlong discussons on the values of stats. Tumadorf is big on numbers and<br/>\ntight analysis, well written and all around in the know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread contains a graph of 6 different strengths, from 55 - 228<br/>\nshowing not much more than random variance and a spike at the magic<br/>\nnumber and 1 damage frequency as one would expect.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum12/HTML/000452.html\">http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum12/HTML/000452.html</a><br/>\nA somewhat ugly graphical representation surrounded by a nice text<br/>\nanalysis. It doesn&#39;t sit too well with me but I can&#39;t nail down why.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I see people commenting on is, why higher strength gives a<br/>\nlower average damage and more hits for 1. Ugh, lower average damage<br/>\nbecause of the hits for 1 and more hits for 1 because the +str bumps<br/>\nthem up from a 0 damage hit (miss). It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t always tell<br/>\nthe difference between an avoided miss and a mitigated 0 damage hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a point of curiousity:<br/>\nHow often do you, as a bard, get ridden for +str songs? I haven&#39;t gone<br/>\nout of my way to use one lately except when I&#39;m smithing. After looking<br/>\nat how little +str effects overall damage (unless in a really melee<br/>\nheavy party) I stick with a haste effect (if no enchanter or I&#39;m not<br/>\nbusy doing everything else) or damage shields or dots depending on<br/>\nsituation. However, I&#39;ve only just hit 42 and haven&#39;t had a chance to<br/>\ntry out McVaxius&#39; yet so everything might change after I give it a<br/>\nwhirl.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i actually have a few questions about this stuff.<br/>\n&gt; +1 str == +1 atk right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; now, is atk like ac in that it is made of up 2 numbers, like chance<br/>\n&gt; to hit, and damage<br/>\n&gt; done, sorta like damage avoidance and damage absorption?  if so, then<br/>\n&gt; real damage<br/>\n&gt; applied would also have to increase.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; anyone got a good link to the analysis done on this? <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
