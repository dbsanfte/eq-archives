Too bad they seem to insist on<br/>\nmeleeing once the target gets low on hp.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing mobs I generally do not charm.  Like you said, if they<br/>\nstart a heal before you charm, it still goes through.  Since<br/>\nthey&#39;re going to become uncharmed roughly every 10 seconds,<br/>\nthey&#39;re going to have a chance to heal roughly every 10<br/>\nseconds.  I put them to sleep with Pixie Strike, or have the<br/>\ngroup kill them first.  Or if the party has a couple nukers,<br/>\nthey can nuke the main target to death before the healing mob<br/>\nhas a chance to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
