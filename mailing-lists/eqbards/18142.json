There is a raft on the Oasis dock - it will take you to an<br/>\nOgre Village in Timorous.  I believe these are the &quot;Broken Teeth&quot; Islands on<br/>\nthe cloth map.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be taken to an Ogre village.  The Ogres I saw conned green to me -<br/>\nbut there are probably a goodly number of them. I wasn&#39;t KOS - but I guy I<br/>\neventually hooked up with was...  If you are working your way back - the loc<br/>\nis +7000 +3300<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up finding the wrong dock - there is an &quot;Evil Boat&#39; That will take<br/>\nyou to The Overthere.  This is a nasty zone.  It&#39;s an undead City.<br/>\nEverything Conned red to me - and to a 48(?) Paladin I hooked up with.  The<br/>\nboat &quot;Looks&quot; Evil so you&#39;ll know it if you see it.  We didn&#39;t get off the<br/>\nboat (one of the con&#39;ed red things was literally ON the dock).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe zoned back to that dock.  If I recall properly it was also an Ogre<br/>\nVillage.  If my notes are correct the loc for this dock is neg 5000 neg 3700<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough shouts we got the loc of the High-Elf village with the correct dock<br/>\nto Fironia Vie.  IF my notes are correct - (they are pretty cryptic at this<br/>\npoint) the loc is neg 200 pos 3600. You shouldn&#39;t have probs getting exact<br/>\nloc from people who are making the return route as the boat stops there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had to swim a lot to get there - but I&#39;m not sure whether this is true if<br/>\nyou know where you&#39;re going from the Oasis Raft Dock.  I thought I heard<br/>\nsomeone say &quot;Go to South End of the Island&quot; which would imply no swimming -<br/>\nbut perhaps it was &quot;Go to the South Island&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless - for me -  I explored the boat (IT&#39;S HUGE with spots yet<br/>\nunfilled for NPC&#39;s) I didn&#39;t realize that I ended up on the wrong side of<br/>\nthe boat and had to make the circuit twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nREMEMBER - DOCKS ON LEFT SIDE OF BOAT - so for this route - you stay on the<br/>\nleft side of the boat from the dock you got on at the High Elf Village to<br/>\nget off at Fironia Vie.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom when I left Oasis to when I actually got to Fironia Vie - 3 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got bound - and then went the short way from the city to the tunnel that<br/>\ntakes you to Dreadlands and hooked up with a pickup group.  There was a lot<br/>\nof confusion and problems with a Ranger who eventually got booted.  There<br/>\nwas an excellent Bard - Ripkey (I don&#39;t think he was on the list) in the<br/>\ngroup however.  Among other annoying things - the Ranger kept telling us to<br/>\n&quot;Sing Heal During Combat&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut shortly there after - Several guildmates (led by Guild Leader 43 Level<br/>\nDruid who tp&#39;d to the Dreadlands) got on - and I wanted to hook up with<br/>\nthem...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Wizards and Druids can TP to the Dreadlands.  This is a huge zone - I<br/>\nbelieve larger than anything pre-expansion.  Plenty of hunting grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure out how my<br/>\nGuild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.  Arkin died once...  Then we<br/>\ndecided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back to<br/>\nButcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe negative - on release day at least - no one had found the way from the<br/>\nTP spot to the zone Fironia Vie (the High-Elf City) - hopefully that will<br/>\nchange soon.  The Guild group and I couldn&#39;t hook up until I did the<br/>\npainfully long boat trip to BB for pickup.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Butcherblock route.   Take the OTHER dock in Butcherblock from the<br/>\nFreeport boat.  There will be little shuttles - this will zone to Timorous<br/>\nDeep and connect to the Boat.  The boat is very large.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUG REPORT - I went the opposite direction - so can&#39;t confirm it - But an EQ<br/>\nVault they reported probs with Shuttle. Take the 1st on one route.  If your<br/>\nshuttle doesn&#39;t hook up with the loading dock on the side of the boat - jump<br/>\noff and climb up the rudder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shuttles connect with the right side of the boat.  Move to the left<br/>\nside.  There are a couple of stops in Timorous - this zone is the equiv. of<br/>\nOOT.  Don&#39;t get off here if you&#39;re going to Fironia Vie.  Eventually it will<br/>\nzone there and the dock on the left side.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the return route - had just missed the boat in Firnonia.  Took about<br/>\nan hour (I&#39;m not kidding)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve only seen 2 zones - and the Dreadlands at least are so big I<br/>\ndoubt that crowding will be an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
