PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>\nfor questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still not<br/>\nfound yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>\nthought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>\nget the similar items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>\nthat, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>\n(role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>\ninteresting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke for<br/>\nthem to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the course<br/>\nof least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 9:42 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in PoG is to NOT<br/>\nHUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not be, and shame<br/>\non you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; creations.
