The data fit the pattern I&#39;ve come<br/>\nto expect from my speed from level 20 to level 40 (the level<br/>\n40 timings were the latest).  I am as fast as ever (if<br/>\nanything, Verant made us slightly faster).<br/>\n<br/>\nI will test it again tonight or tomorrow, but this is getting<br/>\nreally tiring having to retest to verify that nothing has<br/>\nchanged any time someone thinks or claims that it&#39;s different.  <br/>\nIf you think our speed has been nerfed, why not test it for<br/>\nyourself?  All you have to do is time your normal running<br/>\nspeed between two fixed points, time your running speed with<br/>\nAccel and a drum between the same points, and compare to my<br/>\nresults.  Or better yet compare to your results the last time<br/>\nyou did this test.  It takes just a couple minutes for those<br/>\ntwo cases (I take longer because I test the full gamit -<br/>\nrunning, walking, no drum, drum, Mistmoore drum, and sometimes<br/>\nSoW and encumberance).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
