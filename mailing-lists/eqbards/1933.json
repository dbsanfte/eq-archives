I took the boat from Freeport to BB and found that just sitting, my stamina went down a bubble at a time.  Needless to say I started singing Jaxan&#39;s just in case I fell off the boat (which was unlikely because I wasn&#39;t moving) and had to swim for a while.  There were 8 people on the boat and I could only see 2 and talk to none.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The stamina hit has never happened to me during boat travel before.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Weiland of Freeport<br/>\n  Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n  I left my bard on the dock in BB.  Now I&#39;m rather afraid to take him back to Freeport via boat.  I&#39;m thinking about going to the bank in Kaladim and then using the &quot;poor man&#39;s gate&quot; (death) to get back.  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Dan Harmon <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 14, 1999 10:14 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [eqbards] Boat Crashes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday afternoon on the Rathe server, my magician was travelling from BB to Freeport.  There were 5 people in the zone, none of which were bards.  When we entered the OOT, no one was there, and no one heard me when I /say&#39;d.  My roomie told me that she didn&#39;t hear or see me (also on the boat).  Later in the trip, still in the OOT, one person showed up, but still no one saw my /say.  We chatted in /ooc though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BTW, on the boat, fully fed and watered, my mage completely ran out of stamina on the trip.  Earlier in the day I took my bard over, and when I hit 1/2, I started singing the Jaxan&#39;s to bring it back up (I was alone on the boat), which worked. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
