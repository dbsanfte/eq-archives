I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>\nrace and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>\neasily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you guys and gals<br/>\nsuggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is important<br/>\nfor playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does it actually<br/>\nincrease the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>\nfrequently you miss a note?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>\ninterrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>\nsteelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\nconstant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be safe, but I<br/>\nwas thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into dexterity and<br/>\nagility).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a wood elf, as<br/>\nthey tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity. Either elf fits<br/>\nwell in my IC perception of my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
