I know<br/>\n&gt; your much better testers....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as bards being ignored...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one song per lvl, 50 lvls...  if the songs there aren&#39;t 50 songs - then<br/>\n&gt; we aren&#39;t complete.  And they have had 8 months to get them in.  The<br/>\n&gt; priority should be to complete a class before offering more spells and<br/>\n&gt; weapons to others classes - and yes that means even the FA to paladins.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Everyone has their own priorities.  Why should your priorities be any more<br/>\nimportant than someone else&#39;s priorities?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins are supposed to be able to wield the mightiest holy swords in the<br/>\ngame, including the Fiery Avenger.  Brad loved to show off the FA in the<br/>\nBeta, telling everyone how it was the &quot;most powerful sword in the game&quot; and<br/>\nit was Paladin only.  Imagine if you were a Paladin.  You chose to be a<br/>\nPaladin because you wanted to quest for the FA.  Wouldn&#39;t you feel your<br/>\nclass was incomplete if the FA didn&#39;t exist?<br/>\n<br/>\nMages can summon a weapon every level.  But Verant hasn&#39;t put the level 49<br/>\nsummon in the game yet.  Only recently was the lvl 44 Summon Weapon spell<br/>\nput into the game.  Still no word on the 49th spell.  Mages are also<br/>\nincomplete, according to your own definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The  little things, like the enhancements that were implemented in the<br/>\n&gt; last patch, didn&#39;t get mentioned the patch message?  What was up<br/>\n&gt; with the whole - it&#39;s in this patch, the next patch, coming soon,<br/>\n&gt; responses?  Then the patch<br/>\n&gt; with the enhancements atcually happens,  but they don&#39;t bother to mention<br/>\n&gt; anything - other than a change to solidarity of vision!  What about the<br/>\n&gt; three weeks with no explanation given to bards? When other classes were<br/>\n&gt; addressed specifically.  Again, it&#39;s a little thing, but it&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; getting the same attention paid to us as the other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mages had pet healing spells added. or so the patch said.  Some duplicate<br/>\nEnchanter spell appeared on the vendor instead.  &quot;Database entry error&quot; we<br/>\nwere told.  Three patches and four weeks later, the spell is finally there.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaman had Alchemy bugged for 8 months before Verant could be convinced it<br/>\nwas broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards get about the same attention as every other class.  There is no<br/>\nhatred of Bards at Verant, just as there is no special Bard Hate coded in<br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour problem is that you are only looking at it from your tiny little Bard<br/>\nportal.  There are hundreds of things broken or missing in EQ.  Verant<br/>\ntries to fix them, but they do a very poor job.  You seem to not care about<br/>\nanything but fixing your Bard.  Verant has to fix problems with every<br/>\nclass.  They can&#39;t stop everything just to fix Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the enhancements that went in on the last patch.  The see invis<br/>\n&gt; to clouding makes the song much more useful, and increased range on<br/>\n&gt; selo&#39;s is great. But did they do anything earth-shattering... no.  Did<br/>\n&gt; they fix lullaby, increase dodge, implement parry, implement any mid-lvl<br/>\n&gt; instruments - no.  They increased the range of 4 songs.  Now maybe some<br/>\n&gt; of  you can clue me in, but I have never actually used levitation for a<br/>\n&gt; group, or actually used tarews as the way to keep the group breathing<br/>\n&gt; under water.  So unless I am missing something * a very likely<br/>\n&gt; possibility :) *- those two &quot;enhancements&quot; aren&#39;t much of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most bards complained that levitate and water breathing were useless in a<br/>\ngroup partly because of the range problem.  Many Bards asked that the range<br/>\nbe increased.  I believe there was a bard petition to increase the range.<br/>\nSo they increased the range, and your not happy?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this guy said it best...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Abashi is absolutely right... They do get less rants when they nerf!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that Verant has very little resource maintaining EQ.  Most<br/>\neveryone is working on the expansion or new projects.  Only so much is<br/>\ngoing to get done on each patch.  This sucks for us, and we can either<br/>\ncomplain loudly or find another game to play.  But to insist that Verant<br/>\nstops everything until you get your three missing songs (which Verant<br/>\npromised would be in the expansion) is just selfish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
