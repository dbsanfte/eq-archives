Does anyone else think<br/>\nrandom death touches are probably one of the cheeziest cop out design<br/>\ndecisions ever made? It reminds me of something a 12 year old playing DM<br/>\nin D&D for the first time would come up with, not something you&#39;d expect<br/>\nfrom a professional game designer. That and relying on obvious<br/>\nprogramming flaws like zone in delay and through wall and ceiling agro<br/>\nfor their difficulty are probably the things that annoy me most about<br/>\nthis game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
