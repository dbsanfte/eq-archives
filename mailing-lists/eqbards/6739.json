However, the skill<br/>\nratings system is incredibly out of balance, as skills can max at<br/>\n200-250 for combat/magic skills, yet there is absolutely no change in<br/>\nrating after Master at 101. I think they originally intended 100 to be<br/>\nthe max and then redesigned the numeric skills but didn&#39;t get around to<br/>\nadjusting the ratings. At least that&#39;s the only explanation that makes<br/>\nany sense to me. Under the current rating system, Master level should<br/>\nreally be Average, IMO, as you are really only half way to true mastery<br/>\nof your skills. It&#39;s going to go even more out of whack with the<br/>\nexpansion when people can level to 75.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust another one of those things they could be working on if they<br/>\nweren&#39;t so busy re-editing item tables and other critical things I<br/>\nguess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
