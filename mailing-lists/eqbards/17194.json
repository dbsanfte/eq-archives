I am usually on <br/>\nlarger raids lately where any taunting onto me is usually not a good thing, <br/>\nand best kept to a minimum (i.e., &quot;an ire ghast feels the force of ykesha, <br/>\nan ire ghast hits YOU for 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hits YOU for <br/>\n120 points of damage! an ire ghast hi....a_purple_cleric says to the party, <br/>\n&quot;aw geez there goes my mana&quot;...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that they weigh half as much as a Ykesha, they are no drop (no <br/>\nworries of them slipping between the cracks of my hotkeyed inventory boxes), <br/>\nand yes they DO look nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as damage comparisons: I have to completely disagree with the notion <br/>\nthat Yaks will SIGNIFICANTLY outdamage Waks even if you only get 1 proc. <br/>\nWaks will generally do more damage OVER TIME. This means little if you are <br/>\nfighting short battles. In longer fights (such as against 45+ mobs) the proc <br/>\nvs. wak ratio debate loses steam. When you go to the planes almost all of <br/>\nthese factors come into play. You are dealing with mobs that have upwards of <br/>\n12K hp. Most fights are quite long, the majority of Ykesha procs are <br/>\nresisted, and the Yaks suck stamina quite nicely in long drawn out fights. <br/>\nOf course any bard with his mandolin will twist Jig in as needed in any <br/>\nfight. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully agree that it&#39;s personaly preference. Some people live by the proc, <br/>\nothers live by the ratio. After having been beat down more than enough times <br/>\nI&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months. And <br/>\nlet me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry more <br/>\nabout keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n50th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kevin L.

If you aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;worried about the Taunt of the YAK then that is definitely the way to go.<br/>\n&gt;Even though it has a lower dmg curve the Proc causes the Yak to out-dmg<br/>\n&gt;(rather significantly) the Wak, even if it only proc&#39;s once during a fight.<br/>\n&gt;However, the dmg loss isn&#39;t significant to outweigh the greatly reduced<br/>\n&gt;taunt factor if that is a major concern for you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A lot of bards opt for the Wakizashi because:<br/>\n&gt;a)  Taunts less<br/>\n&gt;b)  Looks nicer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s really a personal choice.  I almost never use weapons myself so I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;that concerned ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
