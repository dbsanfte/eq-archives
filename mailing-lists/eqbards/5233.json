It&#39;s amazing<br/>\nhow people get up and run when they see &quot;Zuug emits an oderous vapor<br/>\ntowards you!&quot; thinking they&#39;re being attacked.  :) Watching an Ogre<br/>\nsneaking up to someone (crouch and walk - looks like you&#39;re sneaking<br/>\nand it&#39;s especially cute with Ogre&#39;s.. gives them that &quot;Im guilty&quot;<br/>\nlook) is enough to make anyone laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nZuug of Oggok<br/>\n&quot;Zuug hav mofo mojo!
