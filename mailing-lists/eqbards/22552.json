I&#39;m curious if<br/>\nanyone can give me some guidance on how level 53+ characters can contribute to a Vox/Naggy raid without<br/>\nbeing tossed (or with being tossed, if that&#39;s useful).  I don&#39;t understand the mechanics of when someone<br/>\nis tossed and when they aren&#39;t.  We have a couple of small guild allies that we could use as front men.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does anyone have links to any good information on taking down the Kunark dragons?  We haven&#39;t done<br/>\nany of them yet; everyone keeps saying we have too few high levels (50 over level 53 doesn&#39;t seem that<br/>\nweak to me, but what do I know?  We have about 5 level 60s now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m never getting this epic weapon, we have too many warriors, and two Bards in front of me.  But it&#39;s<br/>\nnice to dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njay schultze wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Creediki[FoH] just got his Singing Short Sword a few days before the patch<br/>\n&gt; went in. It&#39;s pretty damn sweet, and moreso now that it acts as a universal<br/>\n&gt; instrument. He tested it on different songs and found that it is<br/>\n&gt; substantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d drums or kelin&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; lute, but it still amplifies pretty well. I&#39;m sure someone will post some<br/>\n&gt; stats on how it stacks up verses our normal instruments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS. We&#39;ve been killing Vox<br/>\n&gt; weekly, but she has not been very generous with scales. If you want to see a<br/>\n&gt; CRAP loot load, you should have been present yesterday when ALL she dropped<br/>\n&gt; was 4 frozen paladin books. Today she dropped 2 RBB&#39;s, a bracer, and a<br/>\n&gt; crystal spear so she kinda made up for that faux pax, but STILL NO<br/>\n&gt; SCALES...grr...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well. If Shada or anyone else with an SSS posts some instrument-tests I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure we&#39;d all be curious to see how it does. =P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sartori{Legion}<br/>\n&gt; 57th Karaoke Singer, Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
