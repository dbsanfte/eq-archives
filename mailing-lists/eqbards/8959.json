A dwarf warrior gave me a small bronze cloak, and someone else <br/>\n&gt;gave<br/>\n&gt;me a Mithril Quill, both while I was just hanging out near the bank in<br/>\n&gt;Freeport waiting for someone.  Others have giving me things, or &#39;traded&#39;<br/>\n&gt;things as well, where it was obvious I was getting the better end of <br/>\n&gt;things.<br/>\n&gt;I hope this continues into the future. :)  Maybe someone will be nice <br/>\n&gt;enough<br/>\n&gt;to give me some lambent armor.  &lt;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gaelaian<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 10th Refrain, Tunare </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
