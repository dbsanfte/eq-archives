Sonorious Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to level.  I have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with it active.  As soon as I dropped it I was attacked.  I have walked through befallen with the same results.  I have no doubt that our clouding is a universal invisability and was intended as one, there for we do not need invis vs undead.  I think the problem is that many of you who have had troubles with this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered out of range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become visiable, or are trying to hide from undead levels much higher then you where it I guess resisted the song.  I personally would like to see a true mem blur song.. except GZ and crew are more worried about enchanters and balancing us to be lesser the ever present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief, then the actual usefulness of bards.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdon Draigcanwyr 23 chorus of Povar\r<br/>\nChild of Cathar.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 10 Jan 2000 15:49:48 +0000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; .......Invis to Undead, although a bit late I think it would be useful esp\r<br/>\n&gt; in places like L Guk, Unrest, Kith Forest etc.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; A simple song to fill in a missing gap.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; What do you all think?\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Madagan, Bard of 33 songs\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\n&gt; The information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is\r<br/>\n&gt; intended for the addressee only.
