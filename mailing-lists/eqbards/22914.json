Do we see the emergency patch today or<br/>\ntomorrow?

Mage mentioned it seemingly happening<br/>\nat least once to us last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther topies: My WE bard worships Tunare. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdventures over the weekend: Finally dinged 54 in Howling Stones Monday<br/>\nevening! I got a Sash of the Dragonborn there in South tower on Sunday. AC 2<br/>\nplus haste. When the cleric let me melee a bit, I never stopped swinging! We<br/>\nleft HS to help take out the dragon in Emerald Jungle. I say helped, seemed<br/>\nto stay feared or stunned the whole time. I lost the RBB lotto by one!<br/>\nMonday we went back to HS but the paladin had to leave early on, so I tanked<br/>\nalong with a mage&#39;s air pet. The group seemed to think I was a better tank<br/>\nthan the poor pally! Friday was deep VK (I can&#39;t spell that name!). Died 4<br/>\ntimes but had fun. I&#39;m bound in GFay so I can buy stones for the cleric when<br/>\nI die these days and found someone selling Ry&#39;Gor chain pants during one<br/>\ndeath. Everyone boggled at the rezzed bard wearing just chain pants! They<br/>\nwere about an even swap for my silvery legs, couple points AC vs couple<br/>\npoints Attack. I was instrument barding at the time and figure AC is more<br/>\nuseful. They do look odd when DE&#39;ed. They have a purple sash look around the<br/>\nwaist. I even got a nice trade item while in VK, Spider Fur Cloak. <br/>\nA very productive gaming weekend, I need to get too sick to paint and fix up<br/>\naround the house more often!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
