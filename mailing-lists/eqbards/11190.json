There was a Cleric sit-in on Fennin Ro<br/>\nlast night of about 50 or so level 1 clerics.  I can assure you *everyone*<br/>\nin the zone was very angry with these clerics.  They were lagging the zone<br/>\nhorribly and spamming the zone (intentionally and unintentionally) with<br/>\nshouts and ooc.  If we want to make a point with Verant, we need to try and<br/>\nfind a way to do so that doesn&#39;t penalize other players&#39; game experience.<br/>\nVerant won&#39;t sit still for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong 36th on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
