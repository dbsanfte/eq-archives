I had never <br/>\n&gt; noticed her<br/>\n&gt; before (as I am a wood elf, never spent much time there) I hailed her<br/>\n&gt; and she reponded something like &quot;Hello Uldar, I must warn you <br/>\n&gt; if you are<br/>\n&gt; a fellow bard you won&#39;t make any profits with Lt. Soandso around&quot; (no<br/>\n&gt; brackets, can&#39;t remember Lt&#39;s name). When I responded &quot;who is Lt.<br/>\n&gt; Soandso&quot; she responded &quot;I will say no more on this matter&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was in the middle of something, and I assumed that if I <br/>\n&gt; ever found out<br/>\n&gt; what she was talking about and it turned out to  be a quest I <br/>\n&gt; would get<br/>\n&gt; a rusty weapon and 2cp for my trouble, so I left. BTW, she <br/>\n&gt; considered me<br/>\n&gt; Kindy, so not a faction problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone know anything about this wandering bard of Qhills? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
