Took<br/>\nadvice from this list and went to zone 1 (on the Japanese map of Guk,<br/>\nexcellent drawing) and waited. BTW, Sylly, your corpse was still there<br/>\nSunday afternoon ;). Invis. works on the live frogs but not the undead, so<br/>\ndon&#39;t venture to or from the bedroom unless you know the path is clear. Just<br/>\nbe patient and shin corpses will litter the ground eventually. I saw<br/>\ngauntlets everywhere. Greaves took longer because there&#39;s not as many shin<br/>\nghoul knights near the zone. Best place is the bedroom if you can get there.<br/>\nA high level party, including Gymi, a very gracious Song Sister, held the<br/>\nroom and let me know when the greaves dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy trip would have been death-free, except for the Ghoul Lord and his pet,<br/>\nwho were waiting at the zone and charged me all my hit points for my<br/>\ngoodies. But even that had a plus, cause I got to meet Kenross on my CR<br/>\njourney. Nice to meet you, Song Brother!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuery: Looking for a replacement for my Bronze helmet, entirely for cosmetic<br/>\nreasons. I&#39;m going without a head piece right now because bronze is so ugly<br/>\ncompared to the shin items. I&#39;d prefer a graphic-less item or a steel helmet<br/>\nlooking piece (Don&#39;t have the cash for actual steel right now). And I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare for the chain look so Black Iron Crown is out. Thanks for your advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\nMeandering Maestro of the 21st Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
