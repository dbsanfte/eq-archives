This person is responsible for looting the corpse <br/>\nif the group gets the kill as soon as feasible.  If the group leader dies <br/>\nbefore the battle ends then someone in the group, usually at the direction <br/>\nof the group leader, will loot and report.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to tell if a corpse has been ninja looted is if it gives no coin.  <br/>\nAs, to the best of my knowledge, mobs will always drop some coin, except of <br/>\ncourse newbie mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
