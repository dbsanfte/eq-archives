If I want to have a<br/>\nwhatever race necro and max his strength for RP<br/>\nreasons that then becomes a valid creation strategy so<br/>\nobviously we can&#39;t be talking about that.  However,<br/>\nfrom a numbers point of view (which is what Abashi was<br/>\nimplying) str is meaningless.  For a necro<br/>\nspecifically get your int to 200, perhaps raise your<br/>\ncha for screaming terror and after that you want to<br/>\nwork on raising +hp, +mana, +ac and +resist items. <br/>\nAll of these will help you more than strength.  In<br/>\nother words by putting 10pts in str at creation thats<br/>\nmore 10 more int of equipment you need to wear to make<br/>\nup for it...that can be a significant<br/>\nhp/mana/ac/resist loss.  What most people overlook by<br/>\nthinking that its easy to get to 200 int is you can<br/>\nonly do so through a loss in other very important<br/>\nareas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My druid after all has a base strength that is only <br/>\n&gt;10 points lower than his wisdom.  I sure will never <br/>\n&gt;have the mana reserves of other druids, but I can <br/>\n&gt;melee far better than they can.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Druids are an area I know well actually.  The question<br/>\nhere is did you compare AC and weapon/offense/defense<br/>\nskills as well?  A kiting druid often lets his skills<br/>\nlag and focuses on +wis equipment rather than AC gear<br/>\nas well.  Amusing side note...when I was level 50 I<br/>\ntested my druid&#39;s melee vs ogre bouncers.  Using the<br/>\nexact same equipment and spells (dot, damage shield<br/>\nand greater heal only) I was *more* effective with Paw<br/>\nand CGS in hand than Weapon and Paw. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
