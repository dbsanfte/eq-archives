Initally in the lower levels 1-6 I found this <br/>\n&gt; spell to be a<br/>\n&gt; great way to kill myself, either in attracting that ever <br/>\n&gt; popular guard you<br/>\n&gt; forgot patrolled your area of the incredible &quot;there he is <br/>\n&gt; that guy, everyone<br/>\n&gt; get him!&quot; attraction feature of this song.  But lately at 9th <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had alot<br/>\n&gt; of fun practicing my String skill and nuking lvl 1 characters <br/>\n&gt; in the newbie<br/>\n&gt; areas of freeport.  But I&#39;m curious just how much damage does <br/>\n&gt; this song<br/>\n&gt; actually do anyways?  I&#39;ve been using it more and more in the <br/>\n&gt; desert taking<br/>\n&gt; spiders and such.  Makes for a great helper if you think <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re not gonna<br/>\n&gt; make it out alive.  Sure you have to be sure nothing else is around<br/>\n&gt; otherwise you&#39;ll be double/tripple teamed by creatures but <br/>\n&gt; even still I<br/>\n&gt; finally feel like its a useful spell.  Also in a party does <br/>\n&gt; this spell also<br/>\n&gt; do damage to members in your party as well?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gediprime, of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
