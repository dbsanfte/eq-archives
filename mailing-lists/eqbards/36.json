One<br/>\ndetermines the likelihood that your strike will hit, the other<br/>\ndetermines the likelihood that you will avoid being struck. It really<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter how strong you are if you miss all the time, and it&#39;s far<br/>\nbetter to avoid blows altogether than to worry about having enough HP to<br/>\nwithstand them, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nMarianda<br/>\nLegendary Lutist of Kelethin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
