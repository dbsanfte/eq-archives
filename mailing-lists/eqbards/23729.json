With Selos<br/>\nDrum equipped, the movement rate with the 51 song seemed to be slower than<br/>\nSelos Accelerando.  I was in Burning Woods so that may have had an impact on<br/>\nmy perception.  Is the speed bonus for these songs the same or is<br/>\nAccelerando indeed faster?  I have read that when you have a regular<br/>\nlevitate buff up and sing Selos, the fastest you will go is SOW speed.  This<br/>\nis approximately how fast I was going last night with SSoT.  So either SSoT<br/>\nis slower because of the levitate effect or my perception was off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
