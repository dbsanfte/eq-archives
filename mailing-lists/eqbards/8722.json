If the<br/>\nmobs average N hits per song round (3-4 sec for most bards),<br/>\nand Bellow does B damage on average (including resists),<br/>\nBellow will do (B/3N)*(H/D) points damage.  Divide to remove<br/>\nthe common factor and you end up with:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf B &gt; 3S*N then it makes more sense to use Bellow.  You can<br/>\nfigure out B and N with all the nifty new log parsers, S you<br/>\ncan tell from the messages when you&#39;re fighting.  This will<br/>\nwork for multiple mob encounters too, just add up all the mob<br/>\nhits when determining N.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. if your Bellow does 12 points on average, the mobs<br/>\naverage 1 hit per round, and the damage shield does 5 points<br/>\nper hit, then:<br/>\n<br/>\n12 &gt; 3*5*1<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich is false, so in this case, it&#39;d be better to use Psalm.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
