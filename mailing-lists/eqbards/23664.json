Sure, if the drive&#39;s data is totally <br/>\n&gt; trashed, that may <br/>\n&gt; be the way to go.  But if you would end up losing tons of data by <br/>\n&gt; reformatting (and honestly, how many people actually have a <br/>\n&gt; backup device <br/>\n&gt; other than their floppy drives at home???) the easiest way to <br/>\n&gt; do a fresh OS <br/>\n&gt; install is just to rename the Windows and Program Files directories. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
