They have done some<br/>\nimproving in the are of static quests, but their dynamic events are<br/>\nuniversally stupid.  Granted a big part of that is because they refuse to<br/>\nexclude people whose participation is inappropriate and some of those people<br/>\ninsist on taking everything they can grab.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey already have quests that npc&#39;s won&#39;t give you if you are over a certain<br/>\nlevel, this is just a suggestion to extend that to dynamic events in order<br/>\nto allow them to run dynamic events for people who will more than likely<br/>\nnever reach 50th.  Of course I said that once about 30th level, but there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t anyone at 60th then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 1:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Test of ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that would violate The Vision(tm).
