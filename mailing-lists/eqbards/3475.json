Preferable one in<br/>\neach zone if the city is more than one zone.  Charge a hefty fee i.e. 5pp,<br/>\nthe most I have evern seen a caster charge was 2pp, so at 5pp, people will<br/>\nstill seek out a caster to do it, however if casters aren&#39;t available you<br/>\ncan still get bound.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think they should be available in some of the inns that are out in<br/>\ndesolute zones, if Brad wants us to go out and explore these &quot;empty&quot; zones,<br/>\nhe has to offer us some cozy feelings about going there.  I think the Arena<br/>\nneeds a NPC binder, as well as HHK, I also think that maybe some of the<br/>\nzones near good cities should have evil NPC&#39;s who will only bind evil<br/>\ncharacters.  And maybe even double as a bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few ideas I think that would get people moving around the<br/>\ncontinents a little more.  The bank idea may be dumb come to think of it, as<br/>\nit would assist the campers, they wouldn&#39;t have as far a run to deposit<br/>\ntheir loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar Bard of 17th song from Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tKimes, Dean W.

In general it is binding more than anything that is keeping<br/>\n&gt; people from spreading out the way Brad wants them too.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; uninteresting treasure, they just go get that when they know they can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; die<br/>\n&gt; there, then complain because it is trivial to them at that level.  Binding<br/>\n&gt; keeps people close to cites, try playing at a non-prime time like I do<br/>\n&gt; many<br/>\n&gt; times when there are only 600 people on-line.  getting bound anywhere<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just a pain, its often impossible.  I was unable to find anyone even<br/>\n&gt; capable<br/>\n&gt; of binding on all of faydwyr one morning, and so packed it in since a 40<br/>\n&gt; minute boat trip to recover a corpse is ridiculous.  this is my one and<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; real peeve with EQ, binding is given out as a &#39;skill&#39;, when in reality<br/>\n&gt; without adventuring can become ridiculously difficult, simply because<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; are not enough people playing.  That is unacceptable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 3:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: re: [eqbards] Bards and Binding<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with you that it is a matter of balance, but I think it should go<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; other way. I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to<br/>\n&gt; cities.<br/>\n&gt; If<br/>\n&gt; everyone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; of the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; is about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of<br/>\n&gt; this it<br/>\n&gt; is rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound<br/>\n&gt; right<br/>\n&gt; outside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2cp,<br/>\n&gt; Taelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only<br/>\n&gt; how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long it takes.  Bind definitely affects where you can adventure.  Ever<br/>\n&gt; seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone in Upper Guk who the mobs weren&#39;t all green to?  You can bet they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were either an evil race or a caster.  Its a five zone run for any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-caster good race, far too dangerous, untill nearly everything in Guk<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; green to you.  Believe me I will never play another character who does<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.  I left Erudin with very<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exploration because there was literally no one there who could bind me,<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the city!  I&#39;ve likewise had to wait over an hour just to get bound<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kaladim because there was no one around who could bind me.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been a caster I was certainly high enough, 14th level to bind myself<br/>\n&gt; both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; times.  I went to Guk, looked around and left.  Its too far to run when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything around will cause a train and give no xp, except for a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; critters in the interior who are red.  If I was even a 12th level mage<br/>\n&gt; type<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would have stayed since the run would be measured in seconds, not half<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours.  Pure and simple, on average one death in Guk would take up my<br/>\n&gt; entire<br/>\n&gt; &gt; evening of gaming and as a bard I run as fast as anyone.  That is an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imbalance, not a class distinction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
