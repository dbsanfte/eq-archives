You are spamming my window with your spell&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have to sit and explain how a bard&#39;s area affect songs work to another<br/>\nlevel 20 player - do these people have no clue whatsoever about how our<br/>\nclass works?  It is true that many people I group with will admit right out<br/>\nthat they have no clue how a bard works.  I was talking to one guy and<br/>\ndecided to pop invisible for a laugh and then they guy says, &quot;what class are<br/>\nyou?&quot; in a tell because he is confused that I was a solo half-elf with metal<br/>\narmor and I went invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told one guy I am part rogue, part warrior, part cleric, part mage, part<br/>\nranger, part druid, etc...and he goes, &quot;are you crazy!?&quot; completely not wise<br/>\nto the fact that we can do a little of what makes every class unique.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSolidarity bard brothers and sisters, we must educate the masses to our<br/>\nusefulness, especially our fellow bards like the one I ran into in Unrest on<br/>\nSunday.  Here is this level 20 bard with full bronze plate and some very<br/>\nvery nice unique items in a group that I join up with and I don&#39;t even<br/>\nrealize he is a bard until I am in the group for about 15 minutes and go to<br/>\nturn off the healing song and realize I am not singing it.  He is running in<br/>\nand out of the house pulling green mobs (we were both the same level at the<br/>\ntime) and I ask him 3 times, &quot;what songs will you be singing during<br/>\nbattles?&quot; so I can get an idea of what I should be using to compliment him.<br/>\nFinally he responds, &quot;Bellow, unless you have any requests...&quot; and runs back<br/>\ninto the house.  Next thing you know he is shouting &quot;zone!&quot; and runs to the<br/>\nzone with a train of green monsters from the yard following him.  I thought<br/>\nI should probably have attempted to educate this fellow but instead I got<br/>\ndisgusted with the whole absurd scene and excused myself from the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nHalf-Elf Bard of the 21st song<br/>\nE&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jones, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 26, 1999 2:43 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Magical Gloves?
