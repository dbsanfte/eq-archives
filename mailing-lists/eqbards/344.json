I suddenly feel<br/>\nguilty about my Mino Axe - Luini has a great point. Before EQ, I always<br/>\nthought the bard to be far more roguish than warriorish. After all, they<br/>\nstruggle in the streets, searching for musical success, they linger about in<br/>\nbawdy bars, and are generally lounge-abouts. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think in this vein, perhaps something more like a dagger is<br/>\nappropriate. I find the giant snake fang works well, but seems a little<br/>\n&quot;crude&quot; from a roleplay standpoint. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn swords, I find the bastard sword might be a worthy choice for roleplay,<br/>\nbut not that great for combat. It seems to me axes wouldn&#39;t really be a good<br/>\nroleplay choice - they&#39;re cumbersome, have exposed blades (usually) and are<br/>\n&quot;aggressive&quot; weapons (a sword/staff can be used for sparring and parrying,<br/>\nbut an axe is built to rip skin). I think a bard, who probably doesn&#39;t get<br/>\nfulfillment from combat, rather from performing, and carousing, would carry<br/>\nan unobtrusive weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I didn&#39;t truly answer the question, but with EQ, we must choose -<br/>\ndo you want to use a weapon for roleplay? Or for combat effectiveness?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads me to ask the inevitable - why is it that bards can wear plate,<br/>\nchain and even banded? How can ANYONE play an instrument in that attire? I<br/>\nknow when my comrades perform in public they switch to less combative<br/>\napparel. But I wonder if the bard is a class that was fully thought out by<br/>\nthe creators of EQ...<br/>\n<br/>\nMore questions than answers,<br/>\n<br/>\nDendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: A.Rubman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 1:56 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Ok a new thread<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;A.Rubman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>\nSoebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>\na Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>\nwith my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>\nslow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>\nsing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>\nswitched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>\nyou all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>\nlevel 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLuini<br/>\nInnoruk<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 4:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Soerbaird and Verant not effective threads<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Could these horses be any deader???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Come on guys, this mailing list is for the discussion of things<br/>\n </span></blockquote>relating to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;bards.
