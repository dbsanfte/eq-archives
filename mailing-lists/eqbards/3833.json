Pardon me for going off on a<br/>\nsmall tangent at the end of my post and suddenly realizing that it could be<br/>\ntaken personally, and asking that it not be.  That portion was directed at<br/>\nthe large number of posts I see on websites everywahere bitching back and<br/>\nforth about how this element of the game or that element of the game is<br/>\ntotally worthless and should never have been included.  And to a certain<br/>\nextent you DID go there, in that you claimed that trade skills aren&#39;t part<br/>\nof teh fun of the game.  Just because they aren&#39;t part of YOUR fun, does not<br/>\nmean they aren&#39;t part of the fun for someone else... including me and my<br/>\nparty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;And yes i did take that personally , and putting something like that at the<br/>\n&gt;end of such comments is utter bull. You had an intelligent post up until<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;end, therefore an intelligent person will know how someone will take it,<br/>\n&gt;regardless of the footnote.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I personally take THIS comment as an insult.  To me, an intelligent<br/>\nperson would see the merit in a commentary and realize that if someone says<br/>\n&quot;that&#39;s a general you above and not directed at the person that the rest of<br/>\nthe post is directed at&quot;, that is PROBABLY what they meant, and thusly they<br/>\nshouldnt take it personally.  Geesuz  We&#39;re all human.  I&#39;m human, you&#39;re<br/>\nhuman, and joe blow on the street who hates EQ and thinks we&#39;re all<br/>\npyshcotic freaks in need of therapy is human too.  I go off on a tanget<br/>\noccassionally.  And sometimes I dont want to delete it because it&#39;s how I<br/>\nfeel and it&#39;s what I want to say... but it also isnt necessarily directed at<br/>\nany one person... and thusly I say &quot;dont take this personally,. it&#39;s a<br/>\ngeneral rant&quot;.  If you can&#39;t identify with that... well... too damn bad.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
