Unlike raising<br/>\nbrass skill, maxxing out my wind skill each level went by fairly quickly.  I<br/>\ncould go AFK for 15 minutes or so and I would get the 5 skill point<br/>\nincreases.  After the skill caps were raised, my Singing, String, and<br/>\nPercussion skills were easily maxxed thru normal playing with songs like<br/>\nSelos and Hymn.  However, not once has my Wind skill gone up while using<br/>\nInvis song.  It is still at 200 while my singing, percussion and lute are<br/>\nall around 230.  I haven&#39;t bothered with Brass skill lately since its too<br/>\nmuch of a hassle to go to the Arena in Lake Rathe plus I rarely use any of<br/>\nthe songs that are enhanced by brass instruments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else been able to get their wind skill over 200 just using Invis<br/>\nsong?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
