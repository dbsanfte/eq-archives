I expressed the <br/>\n&gt; opinion that it<br/>\n&gt; would be unlikely based on my own experiences at level 23.  <br/>\n&gt; The thread also<br/>\n&gt; discussed whether Selo&#39;s could be successfully used on the island.  I<br/>\n&gt; expressed the opinion that it would cause too much damage <br/>\n&gt; because of the<br/>\n&gt; rough terrain.  I was wrong on both counts.  Let me tell you <br/>\n&gt; how I found out<br/>\n&gt; I was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYay! I&#39;m glad you had a good experience with the gargs. It is nice that they<br/>\ndo indeed run the same speed you do. Since I usually turned circles on one<br/>\nside of the island, I usually used selo&#39;s, but that was mainly because I<br/>\nhated always changing my views when running around the island.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get around 25 or so, you shouldn&#39;t have to kite as much, but it&#39;s<br/>\nalways nice to know you can if you have to. The all instrument attack is<br/>\nalso useful for clearing 3 skels at a time to open the garg spawns. The only<br/>\nannoying thing was that OOT used to have lots of rain and this was before<br/>\nthey extended how far you can see. I&#39;d expect it&#39;s much better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
