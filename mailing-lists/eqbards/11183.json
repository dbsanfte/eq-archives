However,<br/>\nthe vast (vast) majority of the time, it does work for me how it is<br/>\nsupposed to (unless resisted).  I have held reds cold in lower guk, and<br/>\ncount strike as one of my favorite songs.  A few nights ago, a 50 druid,<br/>\n44 necro and myself (36 bard) went down to camp the frenzied by ourselves<br/>\n(I kinda forced my way into the group).  As we were getting ready to<br/>\nassault the room, a wanderer walked up behind us.  Immediately we were<br/>\nswarmed by 4 frogs we had invis&#39;d our way passed.  I thought the druid was<br/>\ngoing to evac, and since I didn&#39;t have screech mem&#39;d (getting sooo hard to<br/>\ndecide what to keep on tap), I started striking the mobs that were hitting<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe necro&#39;s pet probably got one of them close to dead before dying itself<br/>\nfairly early on in the fight.  The two casters focussed on starfiring and<br/>\ndraining one frog at a time, while I struck those yet untouched.  All the<br/>\nfrogs were red, and I was able to keep two down with very little damage<br/>\nbeing taken.  When one frog remained standing, I kept it glazed over till<br/>\nthe duo had enough mana to finish it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love being a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
