Those will drop my Celeron<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;450 with Voodoo3 card (overclocked to 3000 speed) to about 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;frames per second, even at low particle density.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is why I have taken to turning particle density OFF in a large <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and always tell my group members they should too. I have a PIII-450 with <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Viper 770 and 256MB of ram and I still get massive lag in caster heavy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; battles.  The only problem with PD being off is that many songs and <br/>\n&gt;spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give no visual clue.  Verant should make it so there is something, even <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little glow.  As it is I have to pay very close attention to the text<br/>\n&gt; &gt; messages in battle to weave well, it can get very tedious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yup, that&#39;s why I leave it on low.  If I&#39;m busy charming or<br/>\n&gt;mesmerizing or raising everyone&#39;s resist, I have to know<br/>\n&gt;whether or not my party needs me to chain as well, and I<br/>\n&gt;usually can&#39;t tell if I can&#39;t see the root graphic effects<br/>\n&gt;swirling around the mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since you have a 770 (TNT2, right?), can I ask what card you<br/>\n&gt;had before, and how you feel about the performance of the 770?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m thinking of upgrading from my Voodoo3 to a TNT2 card.<br/>\n&gt;The V3 speed is very nice, but the color banding is obvious<br/>\n&gt;and I think it&#39;s a bit slow with the heavy spell effects.  The<br/>\n&gt;spell effects don&#39;t seem to lag the card as badly in glide<br/>\n&gt;mode, but framerate is a bit slower and the banding is even<br/>\n&gt;worse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
