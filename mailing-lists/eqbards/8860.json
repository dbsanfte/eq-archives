I would say from<br/>\n&gt; my experience, which is four lambent stones worth, that about one in four<br/>\n&gt; giants in Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Mountains seems to drop a stone.  This seems to be higher than the<br/>\n&gt; reported incidence from other<br/>\n&gt; bards though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m finding it easier to get the armor quest components versus getting a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lambent stones.  So far I have five quest components.  I have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; auctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the patch came out.  I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once has anyone had one to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for them.  Despite<br/>\n&gt; killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; numerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one.  Do lambent stones<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get dropped in specific zones or can they get dropped in any zone with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; giant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests in order to sell the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I guess its possible<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people are hanging on to lambent stones so they can complete the quests.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know most of the quest components are NO DROP but I can&#39;t remember if<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this for me?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
