I most often find myself fleeing (or dying) in<br/>\nmulti-mob situations (where mesmerize/Lullaby/Strike have a<br/>\nmuch greater impact on the outcome than weapon damage<br/>\ndistribution).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of this you have variability of damage in the mob&#39;s<br/>\nattacks that determines how long you get to swing your weapons<br/>\nbefore you have to bail.  Their attack delay is 30 (38 or more<br/>\nif slowed), which if I&#39;m to believe these other posts about<br/>\nhow variable the damage from slow weapons are, would mean the<br/>\nvariability in their damage should swamp out any consistency<br/>\nyou see due to less variability with your faster weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting &quot;bad rolls&quot; during a fight is really only a problem<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m soloing.  Usually my friends and I are pulling 2-4<br/>\nblue-yellow mobs and fighting them one by one in succession.<br/>\nSo for each individual fight, we have a huge safety margin of<br/>\nlike 5x to 10x - even a 2x variability in our damage just<br/>\nisn&#39;t going to make a difference - maybe I&#39;ll have to Strike<br/>\nthe next mob a few extra times, but over the course of<br/>\nfighting all the mobs, we get pretty darned close to the<br/>\naverage; enough so that my friends and I have a pretty good<br/>\nidea of exactly what we can and can&#39;t handle.  The biggest<br/>\nvariability in fact comes from our inability to distinguish a<br/>\nhigh blue from a low blue when assessing early on in a fight<br/>\nwhether or not we&#39;ll be able to take them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and other people dumping their trains onto us while we&#39;re<br/>\nfighting - heck, 90% of my deaths are due to that.  I can only<br/>\nthink of a half dozen times in the last 10 levels where we&#39;ve<br/>\nhad to flee or died because we underestimated our pull, and<br/>\nmost of my friends use 2h weapons with delays ranging from<br/>\n44-50.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
