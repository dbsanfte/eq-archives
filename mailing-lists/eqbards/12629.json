We start the fight (our technique was to have all 6 of<br/>\nus just charge him and beat the snot out of him).  Well he gets off his<br/>\nfirst charm on the #1 tank (Me).  Before the party knows what is<br/>\nhappening (This was early in the game we actually didnt know what spells<br/>\nhe cast and what loot he dropped, imagine that).  I have turned around<br/>\nand I&#39;m ripping the poor wizard to shreds.  It all goes downhill from<br/>\nthere, and I (and my new froggy friends) win the fight.  Two new notches<br/>\nin my belt (the delf wiz and ogre SK).  However I&#39;m still charmed, so I<br/>\nstart to wander through Guk (thinking how much this CR is going to<br/>\nsuck).  I eventually wander into the entrance zone and slaughter about 5<br/>\nnewbies (I think there was a train from the enchanter, but didnt seem to<br/>\nhop on for awhile).  I feel bad, but I&#39;m also in tears (of laughter)<br/>\nfrom all the weird things people are saying to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappily (for me) charm ends and I am like 5 ft from the zone... heh...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
