(how&#39;s Finland these days) But I am curious how you <br/>\n&gt;      came to the Damage +1 equaling the average damage potential of a <br/>\n&gt;      weapon.  I pretty sure your right, from observed damage while playing <br/>\n&gt;      but is there something you know that confirms this.  For example do <br/>\n&gt;      you know how to calculate Max damage?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  We had a way too hot summer =) Finally fall weather is coming, meaning<br/>\nlots of rain. So soon we will have a way too wet fall ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, for the under 20th level guys the damage is pretty much<br/>\ndmg*2 + 1 max. And max+min is dmg*2+1+1, thus easier to<br/>\njust use dmg+1. We are comparing only efficiency, so can use<br/>\nthat form.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for higher end guys and the strength bonuses into damage.<br/>\nRead somewhere a guy from Verant say they are fixed. However<br/>\nfixed +damage would be ridiculous, so it has to be fixed +%damage.<br/>\nAs such, it does not really matter that much if you do or don&#39;t add<br/>\nthem to the computations.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
