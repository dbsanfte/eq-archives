I use a lot of &quot;slide <br/>\nleft&quot; and &quot;slide right&quot; movement in battle (old Doom/Quake habit). However, <br/>\nI noticed now that when I press the &quot;shift&quot; key to slide, it locks me in <br/>\nthe same direction of movement (if I were turning then I start spinning).<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent a bug report in last night, and even submitted a petition. Was <br/>\nsurprised a guide contacted me (since I said that this was a low priority <br/>\nin the grand scheme of things) and he told me to try to press my right <br/>\nmouse button to slide. I tried this, even though I usually use my right <br/>\nhand for the movement keys, but it didn&#39;t work. He didn&#39;t have any idea <br/>\nwhat I could try to fix, since I mentioned I even tried remapping the <br/>\nhistory commands to different keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe suggested I wipe my opt files, but I just did that last week, so <br/>\neverything is pretty clean. So I submitted a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had similar problems and if so, anyone figure a way to fix it?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
