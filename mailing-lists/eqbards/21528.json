It is available for $15 + shipping at our website www.professorjohn.com<br/>\n(sorry but I don&#39;t have any more comp copies available - they all went to<br/>\nfamily members).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will probably have clips available on our site - and perhaps a cut or two<br/>\non MP3.com or some such - but haven&#39;t had time to really decide on this type<br/>\nof stuff yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis band plays New Orleans&#39;s R&B - Professor Longhair, Fats Domino type<br/>\nstuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as earlier releases:<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I recorded a CD with Sam Burckhardt a Swing/Blues Tenor<br/>\nSaxophonist. (However I&#39;m only on four cuts) Info at his website<br/>\nwww.thechicagoswing.com It&#39;s an excellent CD.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy old swing band (disbanded the end of 1999) is on two compilations. &quot;Swing<br/>\nThis Baby Volume 2&quot; (available at Amazon<br/>\nwww.amazon.com/exec/obido...31-1704706 - only One cut.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two cuts on Jump n Jive Chicago - available at<br/>\nwww.bigchicago.com/jive.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a Big Band CD in 1994 at www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mse...1723120562<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly - I wish I knew how you could get a copy of a rock band I recorded<br/>\nwith &quot;Obvious Necessity&quot; I did two CD&#39;s with this band. Very Frank<br/>\nZappa-esque. I lost touch with the band leader - and don&#39;t know where it&#39;s<br/>\nsold..<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\naka Dan Sniderman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
