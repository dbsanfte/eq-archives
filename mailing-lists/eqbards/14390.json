Range/duration/chance of success seem to me to <br/>\nbe the only reasons to wield a mandolin for these songs anyways... what else <br/>\nare we hoping for?  They&#39;ll sleep better (though not longer, farther away, <br/>\nor more often)?  They&#39;ll be sadder (from the same range, as often, and for <br/>\nas long)?  Perhaps lament reduces the aggro radius by a variable number <br/>\nwhich can be affected by an instrument... but how in the hells do we test <br/>\nthat under controlled circumstances?  Should have asked, damn.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming <br/>\nthat type of song can be increased by an instrument&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBwahahahahahahahaha what a wonderful line.  Sooo what you&#39;re saying, GZ, is <br/>\nthat if the instrument works, it works, and if it doesn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;High Quality Instruments always bump up the effect of a song. Some songs, <br/>\nhowever, don´┐¢t have effects that can be bumped up&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm now I have to pick up that Brahmm&#39;s Horn Menoly&#39;s been holding for me <br/>\nand test Pixie Strike&#39;s magic resist component.  It would seem to fit the <br/>\nHigh Quality requirements, since it&#39;s a mino horn off a rare named mino...  <br/>\nI&#39;m also curious whether a regular mino horn is any different from a flute <br/>\nin this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, honestly I can&#39;t see myself using a flute/mino horn all that often when <br/>\npixie striking, but inquiring minds want to know. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n~Flying Brethren~<br/>\nFleet Footed Singin&#39; Fool<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
