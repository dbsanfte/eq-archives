How many, if any,<br/>\nextra<br/>\n&gt; &gt;training points should I put into Dual Wield? I am using a combine<br/>\n&gt; longsword<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as my primary weapon and I have a choice of either a combine scimitar or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;magic whip, with lifetap I forget its name. Which should I use in the off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hand. I have been trying to get a PGT but haven&#39;t yet. I did get the<br/>\n&gt; Cracked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Darkwood shield.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I *think* I put about a lot of training points into Dual Weild, not doing<br/>\n&gt; trades I I didn&#39;t have much else to use them on and Dual Weild is a huge<br/>\n&gt; event after all that wimpy thrashing around, so I wanted to be up to speed<br/>\n&gt; as soon as possible. THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>\n&gt; fall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>\n&gt; You want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your<br/>\noff<br/>\n&gt; hand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>\n&gt; using a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>\n&gt; (and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24.<br/>\nEven<br/>\n&gt; if you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; you stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; tenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, either things have changed since I played last (went to AC for<br/>\na couple of months, then just didn&#39;t play anything for a bit) or ....<br/>\n<br/>\ndual wield checks when the delay on your off hand is up.  To speed<br/>\nit going up, put a dagger in it (you won&#39;t be missing out on damage<br/>\nearly on) to give it the most chances to check.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should only have to put one point in, then it will max before you<br/>\nmake 18<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note ....<br/>\nDo you know what it&#39;s like to discover you&#39;ve left a late teens bard<br/>\nat the bottom of paw when you log back in?  I left him there *BEFORE*<br/>\npaw changed ............. YIKES!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSIGH<br/>\n<br/>\nI just started playing again on Saturday, after a long layoff, is there<br/>\nanywhere that archives the patch messages? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
