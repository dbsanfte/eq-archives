With multiple guilds<br/>\nand with a bunch of un-guilded people.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need 3 things:  1 - A leader who is hard assed.  2 - An organizer and<br/>\n3 - a cop to keep track of folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as everyone can understand their role and group leaders communicate<br/>\nwell, in the planes you can use OOC as a &#39;guildchat&#39; area so that all group<br/>\ncan communicate.  Use SHOUT for orders from the leaders and information from<br/>\nthe various group leaders (IE:  Cleric Linkdead etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do planes with pickup groups you just need to use your head, keep<br/>\nfolks organized and make sure everyone keeps OOC and shout clear for event<br/>\nuse.  If they wanna chitchat they need to keep it in group/guildsay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nKev<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kenneth E.

You need to know how to<br/>\norganize groups, buff people,<br/>\n&gt; pull stuff, battle tactics, and loot rules.  It&#39;s probably impossible to<br/>\ndo this effectively if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; essentially doing &quot;pickup&quot; groups each time.  Buffing alone can take hours<br/>\nif you don&#39;t have it organized<br/>\n&gt; well up front.
