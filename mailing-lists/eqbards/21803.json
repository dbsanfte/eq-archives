I happen to be one of the bards who got caught in the stealth nerf<br/>\nof Lullaby so long ago.  One day I was saving my party from certain death,<br/>\nthen the stealth nerf goes in, and now instead of saving the party, I save<br/>\neveryone but myself.  So for the few of us still around from release, I know<br/>\nhow useful the song used to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah I made it all the way to 31.  Too bad I have a life.  My fleibility is<br/>\n&gt;nowhere what it was at level 18 even.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be interested to read why you think so?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou got Sonorous Clouding, Consonant Chain, Appalling Screen, Song of the <br/>\nSirens. I agree, these aren&#39;t the best group songs, but all are highly <br/>\neffective for the solo bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it at level 18 that you were able to do that you are now unable to <br/>\ndo at 31?
