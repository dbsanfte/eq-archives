I hope everyone is having a great Independance Day<br/>\nweekend.  Just wanted to let you know that I finally gathered up enough<br/>\nstrength to wretch myself away from EverQuest long enough to update the Bard<br/>\nSong Analysis.  So much stuff has been added since v1.6 that I decided to go<br/>\nahead and make the new version v2.0.  I&#39;ve also got a better way of<br/>\ndistributing the document as well.  The good people at the EQ Bardic Guide<br/>\nhave been kind enough to post it at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.harpers.net/bard\">http://www.harpers.net/bard</a> .<br/>\n     I just wanted to say that this mailing list has been a vaulable soure<br/>\nof<br/>\ninformation to this document. I&#39;d like to say &#39;thank you&#39; to everyone who<br/>\nhas<br/>\ncontributed to any of the meaningful discussions here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Alex<br/>\naka: Goatnatos, lvl 22 Bard, Povar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
