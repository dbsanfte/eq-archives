Karana that were kicking my butt a short time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHorn is armed, lute on cursor....<br/>\nDennons Disruptive Dischord blares across the savana!<br/>\nSwitch to lute...<br/>\nChords of Dissonance rip through the air!<br/>\nA rook is bound in chains of solid music,<br/>\nMy wounds begin to heal<br/>\nSwitch to horn...<br/>\n(punching for 1 pt of damage :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after a short bit, boom, the Rook drops. My health is at about 1-1.5<br/>\nbubbles, and Tszaaz the Bard is reborn, the game has just totally changed<br/>\nfor him. I could have done this at 15 or so but I didn&#39;t know about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow however, depending on the situation I may rarely arm my weapons. Doing<br/>\n34 damage per round per monster (being 170 every 6 seconds on a standard<br/>\npull of 5 mobs) plus healing and slowing with no mana loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoloing is still not easy and you have to make SURE you are not in a wander<br/>\npath...but, um, WOW. Can&#39;t wait till I get to add in the fire shield next<br/>\nlevel Weeeee!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and part of the reason I am so excited about it is because I know my<br/>\nwarrior will be taunting and my cleric will be healing and I will have a<br/>\nchance to survive the resulting onslaught *laughs*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Level 24, starting a whoooole new game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
