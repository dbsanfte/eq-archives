You can<br/>\nseemingly do this an inifinte number of times, as one time when I was 3<br/>\nplat short of buying a needed item I just went and did this quest by<br/>\ngoing from store to store buying up every spiderling silk possible. I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone it atleast 30 times, so its a quest to keep in the back of your<br/>\nmind. In other towns there are quests bards can do, and if you hunt<br/>\nenough orcs/&quot;give&quot; stuff to other guildmasters they will give you<br/>\nquests, though none of them are as good as the bard one.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Catherine M.

Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>\n&gt; quest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; times, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need strings?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>\n&gt; to locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kendrin<br/>\n&gt; (Tunare)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
