I have<br/>\nseveral times been attacked when our ranger pulled and I was singing no<br/>\nsongs, making no attacks.  The mob would just rush past the ranger and the<br/>\nother group members and smack me.  This was back when we were attempting to<br/>\nprevent my being the main focus of mobs.  Nowadays the cleric loves it when<br/>\nI am around.  Normally he has to keep switching targets between the other<br/>\nthree tanks he groups with regularly because they take turns getting the<br/>\nheck beat out of them.  When I&#39;m around he can just target me and happily<br/>\ncast away.  None of the other tanks ever get below 2 bubbles despite being<br/>\nlower level with armor classes 100 points lower.  I usually end up with all<br/>\nthe mobs concentrating on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a new good example of bard hate.  I am standing still with a trade<br/>\nwindow open singing no songs on the hill near the derv camp.  A ranger<br/>\nshoots the lead derv with his bow from out in the plains area.  The derv<br/>\nrushes forward, stops and runs over and backstabs me despite my not even<br/>\nbeing in the rangers group, nor in the mobs aggro radius.  If someone can<br/>\nexplain that away to normal mob dynamics I&#39;d love to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, October 25, 1999 12:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Re: BARD HATE<br/>\nImportance: Low<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The main reason the Hag went for you was not because you were <br/>\n&gt; a Bard, but<br/>\n&gt; because you were buffing everyone in your party.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.. this is precisely what is causing it.   The reason bards seem to be in<br/>\na lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>\neveryone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>\nsongs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>\ncoming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>\njust saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>\nshields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at the<br/>\ndruid)<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 (still) Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
