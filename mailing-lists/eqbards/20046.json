I had a group who didn&#39;t flip out when I mezz .. seemed quite happy<br/>\n... then surpised that I died alot doing it when each one of the tanks would<br/>\nhit a different mezzed mob .. and the Cleric used to join in and thump any<br/>\nthey hadn&#39;t already hit (after I mezzed) ... heh  I even made a hotkey for<br/>\nMEZZing all on ONE mob.  The argument one used was that if they didn&#39;t hit<br/>\nmy mezzed mobs they&#39;d hit the healer.   Weell they hit the mob .. it hit me<br/>\n.. she healed me .. it jumped her ... I went DOH!  I ended up *having* to<br/>\nuse charm to pull two mobs physically away (and hoped all we had was 3) if I<br/>\nwanted to live.   At least they could smack on my charmed mob - and did  ;)<br/>\nin an overpull and I had a prayer at living thru it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I stopped playing with them late 20&#39;s .. they just got to 30 and grouped<br/>\nwith a Bard with Clarity .. asked me to come back and promised me ..<br/>\n<br/>\n- I&#39;d only have to play mana song in breaks<br/>\n- I could do no singing in combat (they seem to notice the mezz/die pattern<br/>\nafter 5 levels, and that mobs like me when I sing)<br/>\n- All I had to do in combat was tank!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh .. I&#39;m a wood-elfen lass and NOT set up as a battle Bard .. more CHA/DEX<br/>\nthan STR...<br/>\n<br/>\nI rolled on the floor laughing ...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the credit of other players who didn&#39;t know much about Bards but had seen<br/>\nme in action .. they rolled on the floor laughing when I told them ...<br/>\nunfortunately my new group all started new chars and I&#39;m helping the Bard<br/>\nthere learn about the hall, song analysis pages and passing on info from<br/>\nthis list.<br/>\n<br/>\n My new group has a very competent enchanter .. and well .. she&#39;s realizing<br/>\nhow much she overlaps the bard .. not just crowd control either ... so I do<br/>\nunderstand the game-play thread.  The Bard (esp. with current state of our<br/>\ncrowd control song) isn&#39;t nearly as good as an Enchanter .. BUT .. the Bard<br/>\nis never OOM :)  Our group accepts some functions at a lower rate (less<br/>\nquickness recently) and provided by the Bard in order to conserve caster<br/>\nmana.   And I know when the casters were OOM ... everyone suddendly would<br/>\nturn and look at my Bard .. HOPING she had the right song memmed for<br/>\nwahtever had just gone wrong :) .. and sometimes I was frantically memming<br/>\none while hoping a tank held!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the group can&#39;t work with you, you&#39;ll be like the &#39;chanter DEAD .. get a<br/>\nnew group .. or retire Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette (Allegretto) Bard semi-retired unless a sane group has formed,<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
