AND you have to figure in that Chant of Battle is a Drum<br/>\nsong that at my level 48 is giving a plus 37 STR and plus 34 AC ! I just<br/>\ntested it with my Nostrolo. Tambourine. I am not a instrument switcher<br/>\nin the heat of battle so Berserker&#39;s only gives them 17 STR and 16 AC.<br/>\nWhat I love with is it combines with #47 Niv&#39;s to give a combined STR of<br/>\naround 50 STR  :)<br/>\n  <br/>\n But your right about one thing. I is really hard now to figure out what<br/>\nto sing. Last night in the Dead Captain room in Karnor&#39;s I good bored<br/>\nbuffing the Monk and Pally and decided to go all offensive with my 3<br/>\nChant songs. I didn&#39;t say anything but after a couple of crits &quot;died&quot;<br/>\nquietly our Group leader said &quot;I don&#39;t know what yer doing Moonie but<br/>\nwhat ever it is KEEP IT UP !&quot;  ..hehe, I should have said &quot;You want mana<br/>\nin battle too now ?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Moonflower Bllue,<br/>\n  48th Bard of Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
