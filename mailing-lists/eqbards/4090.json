I conned one and it said<br/>\nindifferent. Not knowing that invis does that I went up to the shore to<br/>\ninvestigate why an orc would not care about me after bashing all dem ones in<br/>\nWC and MT. I hailed with no response and then remembered that NPC&#39;s don&#39;t<br/>\nrespond to invised ppl. As soon as I turned off invis it attacked me while I<br/>\nwas still in the boat. I backed off and it stopped but it still looked<br/>\naggro&#39;d to me. I decided to see what would happen if I bellowed it from a<br/>\nways out. The bellow went through and it started hitting me even though it<br/>\nwas still on shore, I was in the boat, and the boat was a good ways out into<br/>\nthe lake. I thought I&#39;d be in trouble if it kept hitting me all the way to<br/>\nthe zone line (I didn&#39;t have any equipment sides a drum and flute) but it<br/>\nstopped once I turned around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOdd place it is...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 11:05 AM<br/>\n8)To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n8)Subject: RE: [eqbards] The Lucid Lullaby<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)On Tue, 20 Jul 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt; Yes I have been having some weird experiences with mobs and<br/>\n8)water.
