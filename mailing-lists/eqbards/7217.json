Taunt the player off the pup?<br/>\n&gt; You cannot directly affect any NPCs in the game, so standing<br/>\n&gt; by without taking action is your only recourse.  Unless you<br/>\n&gt; want to duel the person over it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is the problem.  I&#39;m getting really tired of eating other<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s faction.  And I&#39;m not talking about gnolls.  Yesterday<br/>\n&gt; some idiot necromancer kited one of those Barbarian Villagers<br/>\n&gt; by my party near T3.  I&#39;m singing Clarity, so somehow I must be<br/>\n&gt; helping someone, somewhere.  I take faction hits from that kiter&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; kill.  I really like Halas, and I never kill barbarians.  So I<br/>\n&gt; immediately cruised into Blackburrow for a stack of gnoll teeth<br/>\n&gt; to turn into the Pit of Doom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People don&#39;t realize that faction adjustments are a _HUGE_ part<br/>\n&gt; of what you can and cannot do in this game.  For example, if you<br/>\n&gt; are ever considering wiping out Holly Windstalker or Cros Treewind<br/>\n&gt; because they /con blue and you are bored, you had beter think again.<br/>\n&gt; The faction adjustments those two carry alone, will make you KOS<br/>\n&gt; in 3 or 4 cities... instantly, one kill, and blam.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those of you in beta that saw the numeric adjustments, you know<br/>\n&gt; what I mean.  In beta, if you kill a gnoll pup you got +1 to the<br/>\n&gt; guards of qeynos.  However, if you killed a good guard you got -50<br/>\n&gt; to the guards of qeynos.  You would have to kill 50 gnolls to make<br/>\n&gt; up for one qeynos guard.  So factions vary in intensity everywhere,<br/>\n&gt; which doesn&#39;t click with a lot of people.  They see one message, and<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;ve taken -1 or +1 hit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still not sure how we get unearned faction, when clearly we<br/>\n&gt; havent assisted another player in any other way.  This ties in<br/>\n&gt; with &#39;Bard Hate&#39; if you think about it.  The game must have thought<br/>\n&gt; I did something to earn the faction, thus I must have triggered<br/>\n&gt; something in the monster to irritate them.  If this was a real<br/>\n&gt; monster, and not a Barbarian NPC, I bet it would have turned on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 37th &#39;You have slain an ice giant&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
