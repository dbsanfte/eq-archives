I am SO, very, very, very sick of<br/>\nseeing patch messages that quietly proclaim that something is now in which<br/>\nwe have been assured 100 times is in on live servers.  Absor and Abashi both<br/>\nhave continually maintained that the wizard teleports have been on the live<br/>\nservers.  To quote Absor, &quot;the vendor is there and I am surprised you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t found it, it doesn&#39;t have to be blatantly obvious&quot;.  When will they<br/>\never get a clue that if 250,000+ people cannot find an item on a vendor it<br/>\nis 99% likely to NOT be there?  It would have taken someone at VI all of 5<br/>\nminutes to log onto a live server, guide tp to the vendors loc and check<br/>\nthis out, yet it took two weeks of &quot;it&#39;s in there&quot; and two weeks of &quot;you&#39;re<br/>\nwrong Absor&quot; to get it worked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck the port to the plane of mischief was probably only visible to gnome<br/>\nclerics and paladins of Bristlebane before this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tan irate Kitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nVery boring stuff this time.  I guess good for Velious travel, but other<br/>\nthan that.  Well, expect to suddenly see another glowing spinning ball<br/>\nsignifying the minor polishing of the Plane of Mischief (read, oh hell we<br/>\nforgot to put the port in)  &quot;that&#39;s been there all along.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*Small Patch*<br/>\n<br/>\nThese include some minor<br/>\npolishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard&#39;s<br/>\nVelious teleport spells on merchants.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery soon, we&#39;ll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
