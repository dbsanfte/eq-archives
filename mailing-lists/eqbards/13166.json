Not practical.  Even if we did get a permanent bind, could you imagine<br/>\n&gt; how loud the other melees would scream?  If all 7 melee types died in Guk and<br/>\n&gt; died in Freeport at the same time and started running back, who would arrive<br/>\n&gt; first without outside aid?  The bards of course!  We already have the<br/>\n&gt; advantage over all other melee classes in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guk, yes (assuming you don&#39;t bind in Grobb :).  Crushbone,<br/>\nMistmoore, Permafrost, and a couple other dungeons, the bard<br/>\nis the last to arrive due to the excessive time it takes to<br/>\nmemorize our songs (unless you&#39;re using all low-level songs).<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting back to the original question, I think Verant<br/>\nclassifies bards as a &quot;not-a-&quot; class. When casters were given<br/>\nbind, bards were not-a-caster.  When parry and riposte were<br/>\ngiven out, bards were not-a-melee.  When hybrids got minor<br/>\nresist bonuses, bards were not-a-hybrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that we&#39;re not hybrids does have merit.  Clerics get<br/>\nto wear plate because of the taunt effect of heals.  You could<br/>\nmake the same argument for bards.  Aside from plate, the only<br/>\nmelee things I can think of that bards get over casters are<br/>\ndual wield, a slightly higher dodge cap, and weapons skills<br/>\nthat increase at 5/lvl (which is moot at level 50 where 4/lvl<br/>\nreaches the same 200 cap).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
