The bards of everquest<br/>\ntravel,<br/>\n&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>\n&gt; which you said the celts were not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is infact NOT what I said.. I said that bards where not merely<br/>\nmusicians.  That Bards were beings of power and great importants and more<br/>\nthen just a singer of song or player of lute.. there were those too in<br/>\nceltic life.  You might remember one of the Bardsongs never correctly<br/>\ninplimented in EQ was a lore song to learn the truth of what an item is.<br/>\nSomething monks needed for one of their quests.  Bards also have to travel<br/>\ncities much earlier then anyone else to learn their songs... why would this<br/>\nbe so.. think about it.. So that the bards could trade tales and wisdom<br/>\nacross the lands.  Your problem I think is your are already decided what is<br/>\nand is not, and haven&#39;t really left yourself open to the options.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could handle bards wearing chain in a<br/>\n&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>\nboth<br/>\n&gt; sides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i<br/>\nappreciated<br/>\n&gt; that post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>\n&gt; you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>\n&gt; argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>\n&gt; bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in my post I respect the rights of all to go as they choose but<br/>\nfrom a role playing perspective based on &quot;history&quot; then there is very little<br/>\nground to support the non plate position other then lack of plate in the<br/>\nhistoric period.  The bard&#39;s ability to use magic alone comes form the<br/>\nceltic stories of Tailsin who drank the sorceress&#39;s potion of wisdom and<br/>\nforetold much of what was to come.. and Amergin&#39;s legend of putting an<br/>\nentire field of warriors to sleep..  Equally both engaged in combat more<br/>\nthen once.  Like I said I can respect your characters choice.. but to say<br/>\nthat as a class bards would not use plate armor is like saying a priest has<br/>\nnever raised his hand to defend the faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>\n&gt; commited to convictions.  -=)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ka`Lend<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.  Infact I have on more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then one occasion parited with groups above my exp gain level for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sole purpose of helping them and recording their first visit to a new<br/>\n&gt; land.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unlike many I&#39;m willing to bet I also sing sea chanties on boatrides,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make little poems for each of my songs (lyrics) etc.  I also game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have fought wisps till blue in the face (anyone else pissed at the<br/>\n&gt; nosave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now turned burned out lightstone bull?) and have kited,soloed, grouped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and twisted with the best of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m tired of seeing this roleplay plate mail talk and quite a few<br/>\nothers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; let me give you abit of backround.  The EQ bard seems to me best<br/>\ncompared<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the CELTIC bard.  It&#39;s important to understand the Celtic bard as<br/>\nopposed<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what we have come to call a bard.  The religion of the celts being<br/>\nDruidic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was split in several sections with three primary universal among the<br/>\n&gt; tribes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The preist/mage type the ones we typically see in flowing robes and call<br/>\n&gt; druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that most RPG&#39;s consider.  The judge section Gaelic Brehon (sp) who<br/>\n&gt; administered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clan law and succession issues. And the Bard who recorded the histories,<br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the tales, taught the faith, ran the messages, recorded the liniages<br/>\netc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The celtic bard was by no means some weak pansy musician, nor a figure<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lightly.  The bard seldome directly fought in wars but was certainly<br/>\noften<br/>\n&gt; well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trained in arms and would often run into situations in his travels where<br/>\n&gt; fightin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was needed.  In the period Plate was not an option and so from a<br/>\n&gt; historical point, the bard would not have worn plate, however the Celts<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; invent chain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and that being the strongest of the time would have worn that if they<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; access it (bards of the stonger clans) so there is no reason to say they<br/>\n&gt; would reject plate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for your kindred spirit?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Go to ONElist: where kindred spirits connect and stay connected. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
