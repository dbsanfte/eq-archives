An example was when I was fighting something and was stacking<br/>\n&gt; Chords, Hymn, and Jonthan&#39;s in that order. Even though I did not see any<br/>\n&gt; wince message or orange flare the creature I was fighting died (&#39;A<br/>\n&gt; &lt;creature&gt; dies.&#39; not &#39;You have slain a &lt;creature&gt;.&#39;) from the Chords when<br/>\n&gt; Jonthan&#39;s was pulsing, two whole pulses after the &#39;signaled&#39; one. I think<br/>\n&gt; Hymn will also heal throughout all three pulses as well.

I have not<br/>\nverified this since beta, so there&#39;s always a chance it has changed, but as far as I<br/>\ncan tell you only get the increased heal effect whenever you see the actual words<br/>\n&quot;Your wounds begin to heal&quot;.
