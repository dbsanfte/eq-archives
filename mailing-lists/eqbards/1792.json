Ryan freaked out, calmed down, and then the coders went to<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to an error with the export Monday, the song wasn&#39;t placed at the proper<br/>\nvendors (Freeport and Qeynos guild halls, don&#39;t cry foul, wood elves, by<br/>\n43rd, you should be all over the world with ease, and it just didn&#39;t fit in<br/>\nwith the song &#39;themes&#39; in Kelethin), and isn&#39;t active on the spell tables<br/>\nyet.  Next chance for an export, it should be up and running just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, it&#39;s level 43, and you will like it, a lot.  Just don&#39;t waste it<br/>\nblasting poor rats and bats!  It takes a long while to regen that much mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and to alleviate fears, bard mana is based on...CHA and DEX.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny bard 43rd level, no matter what race, and what his or her choice of<br/>\nstats turned out to be, should be able (barring missed notes) to cast it.<br/>\nMana requirements were very closely tuned, based on the minimum natural<br/>\nstats in CHA and DEX any player would have, at 43rd.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHA or DEX inhibiting items and effects should be avoided if you have<br/>\nbaseline stats in either, as they can potentially reduce your mana to the<br/>\npoint where you don&#39;t have enough to cast.  So, don&#39;t pick on the skunks,<br/>\nand don&#39;t get fatigued! Other than that, you should be just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe natural increase in mana per level still only allows a 50th level bard<br/>\none shot, same as those with exceptionally high DEX and CHA, or using a lot<br/>\nof mana boosting items, so they are not going to be able to sing it much<br/>\nmore often, maybe shaving a minute or so off the recast time, thanks to<br/>\nhaving a slightly larger mana reserve to draw from.  Rather than being OOM<br/>\nafter singing it once, they may have a sliver of mana left.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne note, the 49th level Shaman forty point Dexterity buff, and the 49th<br/>\nlevel Enchanter forty point Charisma buff, when stacked,  boosts your mana<br/>\nless than a bar at 43rd, to give you some indication of the minor impact<br/>\nhigher stat scores have on this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet in the habit of sitting down more often.  Easy to do, just mimic the<br/>\nrest of your party, poor slobs who HAVE to sit between every fight, for one<br/>\nreason or another.  Just like hitpoints, mana regens faster when you are on<br/>\nyour butt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 1:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New Patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;when you say &quot;We&#39;d kicked around the idea around&quot;, does that mean you are<br/>\n&gt;part of the development team?  i know you are level 45+ bard right?<br/>\nanyway,<br/>\n&gt;any info on where the song is found?  i think the 5 bard vendors have been<br/>\n&gt;checked. plus i heard it is level 43, so i want it =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada Silverleaf, Level 43 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: J.M.

Most bard songs are<br/>\n&gt;classified as cantrips, quick little spells that have minor duration and<br/>\n&gt;impact when song once, but add up over time.  This song breaks out of that<br/>\n&gt;mold completely.  The mana use, and the lack of regen, was needed to keep<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt;from being overused.  As the name implies, it&#39;s a last ditch effort on the<br/>\n&gt;bard&#39;s part to end a combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We&#39;d kicked around the idea of the song stunning the bard for 10 to 30<br/>\n&gt;seconds as another balance factor, or using a horn or lute as a consumable<br/>\n&gt;reagent, but neither proved practical, or easy to code.  The change making<br/>\n&gt;bards immune to mana regen was relatively easy to implement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes of just sitting to regen all that<br/>\n&gt;mana once you cast the song, twice that if you remain standing.  And thats<br/>\n&gt;as it should be.  The song rivals harm touch at that level in damage done<br/>\n(A<br/>\n&gt;43rd level SK can do 430 to a SINGLE target), and this song will hit FOUR<br/>\n&gt;targets.  That&#39;s 1600 damage, fast.  It&#39;s use should be limited.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And it might encourage bards to wear more mana and mana stat boosting<br/>\nitems,<br/>\n&gt;so they can have a larger mana reserve to draw from, speeding downtime<br/>\n&gt;between songs a bit.  This is fine, as it means in most cases that they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;have to give up better armor to wear the low or no AC caster tuned garb.<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Douglas  &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bierbower@...\">Bierbower@...</a>&gt; Bierbower<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 5:10 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] New Patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I read it the same way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>\n&gt;possible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of any<br/>\n&gt;change that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana regen for<br/>\n&gt;other party members (or maybe I just read it wrong).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ariell, Karana Server<br/>\n&gt;-the resident &quot;dumb&quot; bard *smiles*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;George Holt wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; in addition there is no way for bards to speed up mana regen...
