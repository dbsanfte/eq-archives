First, <br/>\n<br/>\nEITHER :Chords is not a DOT per se.  Like all our songs that have continuous<br/>\neffect it is a DD at the pulse, <br/>\n<br/>\nOR: and by the Marrs I hope this isn&#39;t accurate, ALL our continuous effect<br/>\nsongs use the DOT logic.  If this is true bards will me majorly effected by<br/>\nthis change should it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it is more likely the former that is true, not the latter.  Even<br/>\nso there will be one huge effect on bards in groups.  No one has mentioned<br/>\nit here, which really surprises me in that we have a great group of clear<br/>\nthinkers generally.  I think this issue makes many people jump to attack or<br/>\ndefend without thought, using emotion as their motivation.  The real problem<br/>\nfor bards if this change occurs will be in the use of Bellow.  Notice that<br/>\nwhen you bellow a monster they will often seem to rush at you afterwards<br/>\nbecause you knocked them back a bit?  This movement occurs quite a bit in<br/>\nmost of my group fights, as does the changing of targets by critters.  Now<br/>\nsince all movement is movement that means that every time a critter changes<br/>\ntargets or rushes back a bit from a bellow he will be immune to a DOT pulse.<br/>\nNow since from what I&#39;ve observed all bard songs pulse at the same time,<br/>\neven when started at different times, one would be led to believe that the<br/>\npulse is a universal event.  If that&#39;s the case then every time you Bellow a<br/>\nmonster will be saved from DOT damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem Verant is trying to solve is kiting.  They think its a<br/>\nproblem, so for the sake of argument lets assume it is for a moment.  The<br/>\nmajor effect of kiting is that it allows you to combat monsters you normally<br/>\ncould not, with little risk.  The main objective is to put that risk factor<br/>\nback in, not to make it impossible.  This could be accomplished very easily.<br/>\nIf they set DOT&#39;s to only do damage when a monster is within a certain<br/>\nrange, kiting would still be possible, but more risky.  If they make the<br/>\neffective range twice the range of the melee attack of the critter, I would<br/>\nthink they would achieve their goal.  Sure you could run around with a<br/>\ncritter on you and kite, but one misstep, one hit tree, one bit of lag and<br/>\nthe critter will get a swing, proabably a bash, and if he stuns you?  Well<br/>\nwe all know the result of getting stunned by a deep red, death.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just my opinions on the matter, but in some ways kiting is an<br/>\nunbalanced advantage.  If they make it dangerous again maybe that advantage<br/>\nwon&#39;t be unbalancing, just another advantage.  If they do it wrong, balance<br/>\nwill definitely be adversely affected.  The biggest problem, as I&#39;m sure<br/>\nmany of us are aware, of a class based rpg is keeping the classes balanced.<br/>\nThis is especially true in an environment as complex as this one, that does<br/>\nnot also have continual vigilance and intervention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHey, just give those giants some rocks to throw and we&#39;ll see how long<br/>\nkiting them lasts then!<br/>\nYeah I can see it now...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHatar begins to hurl a rock<br/>\n\tYou are hit by a rock for 80<br/>\n\tYou are stunned...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
