I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she<br/>\nhad a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; total bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; self till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at<br/>\nlvl 18<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My<br/>\ntheory<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did you have her cast a spell afterwards to see if that mana<br/>\n&gt; was real?  There&#39;s a phantom mana bug with Clarity, where<br/>\n&gt; sometimes the mana bar will appear to fill faster than your<br/>\n&gt; real mana.  But when you cast a spell, the server sends the<br/>\n&gt; client the correct amount, and that first spell seems to use a<br/>\n&gt; lot more mana than it should.  This is a client/server synch<br/>\n&gt; problem of undetermined origin, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>\n&gt; our other songs could cause it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
