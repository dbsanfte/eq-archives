This is the reason why I send this message out<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; 2 list.<br/>\n&gt; Last night when we were having network problem, I was still on as my bard<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; Nfreeport.  I was running then suddenly a GM start asking me these survey<br/>\n&gt; question about the bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not know if it is a she or a he:<br/>\n&gt; Do you still like your bard?  ( I am at lvl 19 right now)<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  I loved the bard and still does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What so special about the bard that you like?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  It is so diversify even though we are not good at any one<br/>\nthing<br/>\n&gt; but we can mostly do it<br/>\n&gt; all at a very low skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you think of the bard compare to SK, Warriors, Rogue, and Wizards?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  I do not know about the other class but I have played as a<br/>\n&gt; rogue.  I played as a rogue originally but after reaching lvl 17 I find it<br/>\n&gt; not as fun anymore.  The skill are broken.  Nothing to look forward to<br/>\n&gt; beyond lvl 17 so I created this bard.  I was not expecting much.  I was<br/>\n&gt; testing out this class but now I loved it.  it takes a lot of patience to<br/>\n&gt; play a bard well because every song is different and each apply<br/>\ndifferently<br/>\n&gt; in different situation.  I still used my lvl 1 and 7 songs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you want to play any of those classes?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  I said not really.  I am having too much fun with my bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does a bard fit into a group?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  People do not understand what a bard does for group.  We can<br/>\n&gt; heal, buff, debuff, speed, and attack also.  But people would rather have<br/>\n&gt; the 3 most important class first before considering the bard: Warriors<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; ( Warriors, Monk, Paladin, SK, Rangers), Clerics, Magic class (Magicians,<br/>\n&gt; wizards, Necromancer)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is the bard favorite weapon?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  We do not have a specific weapon.  We used what ever is<br/>\n&gt; available to us.  But I would not mind having a special instrument<br/>\n&gt; implemented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What extra would you like to see in the bard (Teleportation, some other<br/>\n&gt; stuff I cannot remember)?<br/>\n&gt; My answer:  I would not mind having bind.  It would makes our travel a lot<br/>\n&gt; easier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then the person says thanx and that was it.<br/>\n&gt; I think this person seek me out because there was a lot of complaint about<br/>\n&gt; bard after reaching lvl 20.  Also that I do /guildsay after I do something<br/>\n&gt; amazing like kill 2 orc priest at one time with losing only 1/2 of my<br/>\nhealth<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It is good to be a wood elf bard.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think they (Verant) do care about our opinion.<br/>\n&gt; To the rogues: Maybe it is taking them a long time to implement what they<br/>\n&gt; promise.  Lets keep our finger cross.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All of these answers are my opinion of the class and experience.  I know I<br/>\n&gt; have very little of it because I am only lvl 19.  Only if those mages<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; stop stealing my kills then maybe I might be able to lvl a little faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\n&gt; Hammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\n&gt; Champions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
