Killing him does indeed make you faction with the<br/>\nFreeport Militia bad and yes you can be KOS, but there is an easy way for<br/>\nyou to raise your faction with the people and militia of Freeport.  My<br/>\nfriend was KOS for killing him in hopes of completing the Paladin Quest,<br/>\nhe is not apprehensive.  I also know of Trolls that are amiable in the<br/>\ncity.

The people are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beware, this will make you KOS to the Freeport Militia.  They<br/>\n&gt; are the guards in West and East Freeport.  The guards in North<br/>\n&gt; Freeport are all paladins (except Krazen) which is why you do<br/>\n&gt; not become KOS to them.  This is actually part of a bigger<br/>\n&gt; plot, in which the paladins and the militia are both fighting<br/>\n&gt; for control of Freeport.  Nearly anything that raises your<br/>\n&gt; faction with the paladins lowers it with the militia, and vice<br/>\n&gt; versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually there is one way to raise your faction with the Freeport Militia<br/>\nwithout harming you faction with the paladins.  If you go into the tunnels<br/>\nbeneath Freeport you will bump into a human standing beside a a dwarf.<br/>\nWhen you talk to the dwarf he will mention how much he misses Kaladim.  To<br/>\nalleviate his homesickness you give his human friend some dwarven ale and<br/>\nbang you improve your faction with the Freeport Militia.  BTW if the<br/>\nFreeport Militia hate you, the people of Freeport will hate you also.<br/>\nExcept in North Freeport since the Paladins run that area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
