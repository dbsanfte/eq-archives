If that&#39;s too<br/>\n&#39;unrealistic&#39; for them, why not do the following:  <br/>\n/trust allows someone else to drag and loot your corpse.<br/>\n/consent allows someone to drag and loot your corpse without suffering<br/>\npenalties<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd in a penalty that every item you loot off a PC corpse that you do not<br/>\nhave consent to gives you a major faction hit to that players race and<br/>\nclass.  This lets such things have in game consequences.  To further prevent<br/>\n&#39;mule&#39; abuses, make some percentage of these faction modifications carry<br/>\nover to the characters station id so that every character they play would<br/>\nshare in the responsibility for these anti-social actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
