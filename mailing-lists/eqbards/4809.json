(anyone else notice that when<br/>\n&gt;someone else stirs up that place and gates it stays stirred up even<br/>\n&gt;after they gate?) Usually using an area effect song in that place is a<br/>\n&gt;quick ticket out of the place, with it&#39;s buggy z axis allowing casters 2<br/>\n&gt;floors down to detect and cast on you, but this time it slept a bunch of<br/>\n&gt;ghouls long enough for my party to finish off way more than we normally<br/>\n&gt;could have handled.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this is true as I&#39;ve only been to the lower guk tower a few <br/>\ntimes, but I have repeatedly been warned to NOT use any spells or songs on <br/>\nthe bridge area past the stairs leading to the tower, as it it bugged. I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen it happen but i heard the entire tower can be pulled at once by <br/>\ndoing this?<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 38th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
