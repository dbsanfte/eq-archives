Last night I was killing time waiting for a friend and picked GF up<br/>\non track again.  I decided I&#39;d try to kite him (level 36, MM drums, using<br/>\nFufil&#39;s because the range is sooooo much better than Bellow) and got a<br/>\nnasty<br/>\nsurprise.  Yes, I am faster than him.  No, I am not fast enough to kite him<br/>\n- even very shallow turns brought me into his range (which is a lot farther<br/>\nthan other griffs - more like a giant).  He hits *at least* as hard as HGs,<br/>\nand seems to double attack a lot more.  Well, I ended up in a crumpled blue<br/>\nheap on a hillside in NK, and learned a little humility. = )  I have rather<br/>\na lot of experience kiting (made most of my experience from 15 to 21 that<br/>\nway), and I must admit that this is something toward the top of my &quot;must do<br/>\nsomeday&quot; list - gotta prove to myself I can do it.  On the other hand, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot suicidal, and I&#39;ll wait until 40+ and maybe upgrade to Selo&#39;s Drum<br/>\nfirst... &lt;drool&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n========================================================================<br/>\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\nand reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n========================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
