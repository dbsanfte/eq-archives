WTG!!  Grats!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remember level 20 as the first really great achievement.  And even now I<br/>\n  think it is the &quot;best&quot; accomplishment in the game - getting your first<br/>\n  surname.  When I was level 20, all I knew was that surname really made you<br/>\n  different.  Ya either had one or not.  At that point level 50 was so distant<br/>\n  that it was not even a consideration.  Level 20 and then level 32 - that<br/>\n  defined you as a real bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Skarsol Singzemol<br/>\n  Skarsol Playzemol<br/>\n  Skarsol du&#39;Aria<br/>\n  Skarsol Fortisimo (not sure what that means but sounds cool no?)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: &quot;Rains, Darryl&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dsrains@...\">dsrains@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 03, 2000 2:51 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Surname<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Hiya fellow songsters.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I finally made 20th level yesterday. It has been a long hard trip so far.<br/>\n  I<br/>\n  &gt; don&#39;t see how a lot of you guys move up so fast. I am lucky if I can gain<br/>\n  1<br/>\n  &gt; level per week. Anyway, I was wondering if you have any ideas for a good<br/>\n  &gt; surname. I figured ya&#39;ll had probably seen, or thought about it a lot more<br/>\n  &gt; than I have. I was thinking of using Windsong.
