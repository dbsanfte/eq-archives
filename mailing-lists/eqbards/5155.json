Do you question when<br/>\nyou hit for max damage in melee 5 times in a row? Then why the big fuss over<br/>\nsome missed notes? It happens, I think they have a name for it, bad luck?<br/>\n  It reminds me of the cleric&#39;s list not too long ago. After a patch that<br/>\nnerfed their highest DD spell 10%, there was a lengthy thread about how<br/>\nVerant was TESTING them! Yes, Verant was going to see how much they could<br/>\ntake away before  the clerics would say something :)<br/>\n  So expect a cleric petition on EQVault in a few days, should we expect a<br/>\nbard petition shortly after?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaflay<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tKeith G.

I checked with my enchanter<br/>\n&gt; friend and he thinks he might have fizzled all of 2 times last night, but<br/>\n&gt; noted that after every patch the enchanter boards fill up with this same<br/>\n&gt; paranoid nonsense that resist rates and fizzle rates have changed, and<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; running a few tests they&#39;re always around where they should be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to run some trials tonight, and I suggest before anyone else<br/>\n&gt; makes<br/>\n&gt; accusations of silent nerfing or any other wonderful conspiracies they do<br/>\n&gt; the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And a note about the random number generator, it does -seem- it likes long<br/>\n&gt; strings of failures in a row, but over time, it still comes up statiscally<br/>\n&gt; correct.<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: scott brisko &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 1:20 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Missed notes on songs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just to add one more glitch to the list...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t have the problem of missing notes that often, but when I do, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;seems that I miss a lot of them. The other night it took me 6-7 attempts<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get Selo&#39;s going, which seems like an awful lot of bad random numbers<br/>\n&gt; rolls<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to get at one time.
