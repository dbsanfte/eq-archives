His talk says that he got it from a bard, <br/>\n&gt; that the helm<br/>\n&gt; is only usable by bards, and that the bard said it came from <br/>\n&gt; Sebilis where<br/>\n&gt; all of the class helms are coming from that I know of.<br/>\n&gt; \tIf the quest for the cake turns out to be quite <br/>\n&gt; elaborate and time<br/>\n&gt; consuming then I can see Verant putting this as the reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nOld school buds here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/10/_/451022/_/961028829/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/10/_/451022/_/961028829/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
