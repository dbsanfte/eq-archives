But instead it was decided that the enchanter should get to keep<br/>\nthe item and that I shouldn&#39;t get to roll for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really angry to be treated like this especially as we have just got a<br/>\nnew charm song, the tranix crown would of been great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I would post this here and see whether you guys and girls<br/>\nthink I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 44.8 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
