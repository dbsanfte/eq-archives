As such, we did not<br/>\nplan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, given today&#39;s server maintenance being performed by our Operations<br/>\nTeam, we were able to include a few small updates.  These include some minor<br/>\npolishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard&#39;s<br/>\nVelious teleport spells on merchants.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery soon, we&#39;ll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland<br/>\nE.
