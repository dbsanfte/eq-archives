It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>\ncould have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>\ncharacters, each on a different server:<br/>\n<br/>\nPendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>\nWindsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>\nNona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>\nI just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>\ncharacters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>\nthan I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>\nwell amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************************************<br/>\n          Windsinger Legendmaker on Innorouk<br/>\n               The Wayward Travelers<br/>\n\t  Friends are a Bard&#39;s Best Defense!<br/>\n*******************************************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
