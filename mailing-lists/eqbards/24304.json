Actually, you don&#39;t even have to click to pause it, <br/>\nyou can just click done and come back.  But, once you log, you have <br/>\nto start a new game.  But why would multiplayer be pointless?  In my <br/>\nmind, they would just make it so you have to start a new game with <br/>\nanother player so that both are starting fresh.  I think that it <br/>\nwould be fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad that they added Gems.  I know a while back, many players <br/>\nwere requesting casinos in towns so that they can gamble and play <br/>\ngames.  They said that it would be too buggy and exploitable <br/>\npossibly, but I think that Gems (and other possible future games) is <br/>\na good compromise.  The best things I can see about it are...  Camps <br/>\nwill become much less boring, when you still have to stare at the <br/>\nspell books with pre-35 casters, waiting for group <br/>\nassignments/buffing on raids, etc.  Although, like you said.  People <br/>\ncan die if they aren&#39;t paying attention and just playing Gems.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beatdrop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Gordon Hughes&quot; &lt;ghughes@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; You can resume paused games at a later stage.
