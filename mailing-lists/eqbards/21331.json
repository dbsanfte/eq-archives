I was one of the early traders<br/>\nIllanda Syll - hung about on and off for around 2 years, also had a Bard in<br/>\nDR and I don&#39;t remember her name but think I met Talies as that char.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Bards (except the low one on Test) are deleted - was sort of waiting on<br/>\nthe recent tests to decide what to do - I have an Enchanter that plays well<br/>\nand often gets invited for pick-up groups and is in a guild that does hunt<br/>\ntogether a bit. So .. why is it I still have the urge to play a Bard .. and<br/>\nwhy am I considering throwing in the towel on EQ after seeing Verant&#39;s<br/>\nresponse to testing these songs?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts the tedium.  My Bards have been by far the least tedious to play in EQ -<br/>\nand some of the nicer to do light RPing with.  After a Bard I&#39;m spoiled when<br/>\nit comes to long med breaks or long sit-on-the-tush breaks.   They can solo<br/>\nwith less tedium than most other classes which also group well.  So I&#39;m not<br/>\nbored to tears while I go zone to zone looking for groups, I can kill a few<br/>\nmobs .. shout/ooc for group while I rest .. repeat ... and its not too bad<br/>\nto run quickly to a far off zone should some friends pop up there with a<br/>\ngroup.   But .... is playing a Bard worth the ineffective (broken) songs and<br/>\nthe massive death rate 20s on?  for me not really.  I have played other<br/>\nclasses to respectable levels (up into the really must group range for all<br/>\nbut the other hybrids) and just don&#39;t like them as well as Bards - and its<br/>\ntedium.  I have finished two 5 and 6 novels series reading in the down-times<br/>\nwhile waiting for a group - or while in one.  OK I so *do* read fast - and I<br/>\nalso play odd hours so have to rely on pick-up groups 75% of the time.   If<br/>\nBard isn&#39;t &quot;playable&quot; within my frustration limit window (past about level<br/>\n20)  and the other classes which are quite playable (Enchanter, Necro,<br/>\nWarrior, Shaman, Wiz) and also more welcome in groups (Enchanter, Warrior,<br/>\nWiz even) also exceed my playablity tolerance for tedium (esp after the<br/>\nplaying a Bard).  Aaaaaaa!  Yes, I as well only log on to see friends now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had considered it more likely that Bards would be repaired before the game<br/>\nwas made less tedious.  Tho now it looks like neither.    Perhaps its time.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the dead Menuette, the living Hechicera .. and thier typist who&#39;s getting<br/>\nbored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 6:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] PK problems (was: Horizons) (now REALLY offtopic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 02:38 PM 9/8/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Grief PKing was &quot;solved&quot; by creating a complete duplicate of the UO<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;world where pking is not allowed at all. i.e. Adding a switch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think for me the most interesting part of the Horizons solution was the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;idea that some PK&#39;er could log in one day, walk out of his house and get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PK&#39;d by a random server generated assassin that would always know where<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was.  Talk about just desserts.  Just the idea of having a Venril Sathir<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like mob jumping grief-causers when they were totally unprepared was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;amusing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ahh - but there can be problems with this as well.<br/>\n&gt; Let me share with you a story of the original Talies - Talies Wanderbur, a<br/>\n&gt; Halfling Bard in Dragonrealms...<br/>\n&gt; One night, as they were preparing to open Jadewater Mansion for the first<br/>\n&gt; time, I was waiting around, decked out in my finest (actually, my Trader<br/>\n&gt; Patron&#39;s finest - I was just an outlet store for her unique wares).  As I<br/>\n&gt; scanned the ever-increasing crowd, one face jumped out at me - Muumuu -<br/>\n&gt; well known corpse-robber, and despised by the Bardic community as a<br/>\n&gt; whole.  Most recently he had stolen a poor young Bardess&#39;s recently<br/>\nbonded*<br/>\n&gt; lute, and refused to return it, or any of the other items he had<br/>\n&gt; stolen.  Generally, he just logged when confronted.  Hoping to finally<br/>\n&gt; recover the missing instrument, but knowing that as young a bard as I was,<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t confront him myself, I ran quickly to the Bard&#39;s Guild and<br/>\n&gt; passed through the mystic portal, into the inner sanctum.  &quot;Muumuu&#39;s<br/>\nhere -<br/>\n&gt; I just saw him heading for the bridge!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Nothing like a call to arms to rouse every Bard and their friends.  We<br/>\n&gt; rapidly assembled a posse of 5 including a War Mage with a familiar we<br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; using to track Muumuu&#39;s movements.  Having spotted him in the bad part of<br/>\n&gt; town, we began to make our way there, only to see the Mage suddenly<br/>\nstiffen<br/>\n&gt; and slump to the ground.  One of the Bards who knew him well called it<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Familiar shock&quot; - someone had slain his familiar (a serious offense!<br/>\nLike<br/>\n&gt; killing someone&#39;s puppy!)  Incensed, we rushed to the scene, just in time<br/>\n&gt; to witness Muumuu fleeing in the opposite direction.  We gave chase,<br/>\n&gt; finally cornering him in an alley, where, with weapons drawn, we<br/>\nconfronted<br/>\n&gt; him about the missing items.  Being as low as I was, I knew all I could do<br/>\n&gt; was aim and keep Muumuu under close watch in case he should try to<br/>\n&gt; flee.  Suddenly a burly warrior stepped in and accused us of harassing the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;young trader&quot; Muumuu.  Despite our statements, and Muumuu&#39;s own snide<br/>\n&gt; remarks, the warrior refused to stand aside, and suddenly advanced on one<br/>\n&gt; of our own, slaying him in one blow!  This was a great shock to us all, as<br/>\n&gt; one learns that you NEVER kill someone in town, or the guards throw you in<br/>\n&gt; jail.  Seeing nothing happen to this Warrior, however, and catching Muumuu<br/>\n&gt; backing away from the corner of my eye, I loosed, piercing him through the<br/>\n&gt; throat, killing him on the spot.  An act, I admit now, that was poorly<br/>\n&gt; thought out, and I do regret - did regret the instant I did it, for no<br/>\n&gt; sooner had the arrow left my bowstring, than I was clapped in irons and<br/>\n&gt; dragged off to a cell, while the remainder of my comrades fought the<br/>\n&gt; warrior valiantly.  The warrior, incidentally, was never captured, while I<br/>\n&gt; lost all of mine (and my Patrons) hard earned items (courtesy of another<br/>\n&gt; bug we won&#39;t go into ;).<br/>\n&gt; So you see the problem with NPC-meted justice is that it isn&#39;t always<br/>\nfair,<br/>\n&gt; because NPCs can&#39;t see the real circumstances behind anything - and since<br/>\n&gt; they are programmed by people who make mistakes, they will make those<br/>\n&gt; mistakes over and over again...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; 5 worlds and counting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
