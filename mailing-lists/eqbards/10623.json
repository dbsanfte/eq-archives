The 9/9 is tempting, but it&#39;d cause a hassle whenever<br/>\nnight fell.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, missed notes have been aggrivating me to no end.  My current wish<br/>\nis to pick up a cloak of shadows, but I don&#39;t see that happening anytime<br/>\nsoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor necklace, I&#39;ve got the 5dex one at the moment (cat&#39;s eye gold, I<br/>\nbelieve).  My friend hasn&#39;t gotten to the point where she&#39;s able to make<br/>\nme a BP choker without blinking at the cost (I helped fund her through the<br/>\nearly skill development, considering it a worthwhile investment ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, stuck at 36 through Sunday, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
