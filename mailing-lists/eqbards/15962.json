I have been fighting<br/>\nstuff that is 50-53 (ok, me and 23 of my fiends have).  Last night my cleric<br/>\nasked me to play mana song only when in melee and asked a warrior to stop<br/>\ntaunting (me 48 and war 47; mob 52+).  He said it was just too hard keeping<br/>\nus alive.  That seemed to reduce the &#39;attention&#39; I got from the mobs while<br/>\ncontributing my slashes for 10 and 12.  I switched my Yk to off-hand to<br/>\n*reduce* the amount of procs.  Yes, even though it getst resisted, it still<br/>\ndoes 75dd worth of taunt.  And when the Gorg or whatever finally decided to<br/>\npay attention to me: hits YOU for 320; hits YOU for 412; kicks YOU for 68!<br/>\nHave a nice round!  My bar would blip down 2 bubs in a flash.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I might even try 6 Note and Dragoon Dirk just to avoid that proc<br/>\ntaunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. we speculate that the hate list is pretty short.  so we move everyone<br/>\ninto melee range in hopes that peeps are moved on to and off of the hate<br/>\nlist as much as possible.  talk about bard hate?  one of our enchanters died<br/>\nfast one time and all she did was cast rune 3 or 4 on herself - no melee, no<br/>\nnuking - just buffing and whammo!  Down she went.  In fact, she died lots<br/>\nmore than i did (i may have gone the whole night with either 0 or only 1<br/>\ndeath.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 10, 2000 11:14 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Gold Platted Crappy Weapon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Depends on what you are fighting.
