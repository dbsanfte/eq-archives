Again to draw a Rolemaster comparison (these seem to fit the model a<br/>\nlot don&#39;t they?) it seems to last: <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t#Pulses = Amount Resistance Roll failed by / X<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThus it should seem to last longer on creatures with lower<br/>\nresistance or lower level, but not always as the random factor can kick in.<br/>\nGives a variable length as can be seen but if a roll of say 95 still fails<br/>\nby 40 and X is 10 it would still last 4 pulses on that very green mob.  When<br/>\nthat 96 comes up (open-ended in Rolemaster for those who don&#39;t know) and a<br/>\nsecond roll of say 50 is added to it for a total of 145 the very green mob<br/>\nresists successfully.  This seems to be true but unlike Rolemaster the base<br/>\nnumber needed to resist in EQ, when the target is 7 levels higher than the<br/>\ncaster, jumps to zero so that the MOB cannot fail to resist a spell from<br/>\nsomeone more than 6 levels below it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDon&#39;t have Charm song yet, but does it seem to follow this<br/>\nsame pattern?  i.e. does it last longer on very green mobs than on blues and<br/>\nreds?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 4:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Digest Number 465<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 27 Oct 1999, RaceFace wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How long does the effect of the Lament last after you sing it to the mobs?<br/>\n&gt; Will I have to do it over again when I take on the next mob?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt lasts several minutes for me.
