Dang.  And I<br/>\nknow I have seen the message, &quot;you resist,&quot; and it certainly did seem like<br/>\nthe songs of resistance didn&#39;t do anything anyway (but to be honest I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee how I swing more often juggling Anthem and Whistling with a burst of<br/>\nBellow thrown in).<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting drakes, I always sung Elemental Rhythms, guess I was just wasting<br/>\nmy time.  What a let-down, and I never would have noticed!  Seemed like it<br/>\nhelped once in a while--probably just luck.  A placebo song!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
