I tried out the<br/>\npsalm of mystic shielding plus my base 38 magic resistance. I resisted<br/>\neverything. And i mean everything. Poor guy did 0 dmg to me (might have hit<br/>\nme once if he had tried to use his mace heh). Stuns, blindness,<br/>\nRetribution, etc. Total resists everytime. Inbetween my interrupting him<br/>\nwith pixie strike and my 100% immunity to his spells... he was pretty<br/>\nfrustrated. One nice thing about pixie strike also is that it will stun<br/>\nthem still... so if they are running around like a chicken with their head<br/>\ncut off, this will nail them in their tracks so you can get up the shield,<br/>\nchain them, and then maybe a pulse of verses of victory or the lvl 48<br/>\nlargos or whatever else you want before turning on attack. This was my real<br/>\nfirst pvp attempt ever btw, just didnt expect to whip him so soundly :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
