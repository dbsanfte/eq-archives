We are entering the Gamma Quadrant in hopes of tracking down the<br/>\n&gt; source of this mysterious transmission. Kirk out.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock peers into his scope, green light covers the upper <br/>\n&gt; part of his<br/>\n&gt; face<br/>\n&gt; as waves and lines scramble across numorous monitors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Spock- &quot;Captian, it appears as if this signal is coming from <br/>\n&gt; a planet in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Sony system. A small inhospitible planet full of noxious gasses called<br/>\n&gt; Verant X.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What sort of intelligent life form could live in such a<br/>\n&gt; place? Mr. Sulu, set up the deflector dish array with an ion <br/>\n&gt; pulse to help<br/>\n&gt; pinpoint the transmission source.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Sulu- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lt. Uhura- &quot;Captian, Im getting a much stonger signal now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Onscreen.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the crew is stunned to see a humanoid life form on the screen <br/>\n&gt; smiling at<br/>\n&gt; them all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Hiya gang! I am Abashi from Verant X!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;We intercepted your signal. Are you in need of <br/>\n&gt; assistance?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;No, silly. The signal you intercepted, as you so <br/>\n&gt; quaintly put it,<br/>\n&gt; God I just love roleplaying, was actually an enhancement to <br/>\n&gt; your ship we<br/>\n&gt; were patching to you. You didnt really need to respond.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;I dont understand...enhancement? What have you <br/>\n&gt; done to my<br/>\n&gt; ship? Shields up! Red alert!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh stop..you dont even know if youll like it or not. We just<br/>\n&gt; thought that warp speed was a little too unbalancing. The Klingons and<br/>\n&gt; Romulans dont get to go nearly that fast. Trust me, its only <br/>\n&gt; a small change<br/>\n&gt; to your speed. Maybe 10% to 50%.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Scotty! I want a complete report on all warp <br/>\n&gt; drives. I want<br/>\n&gt; to know what this fiend has done to us!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Scott- &quot;Aye Captian&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh youre not going to start whining now are you? I <br/>\n&gt; just hate it<br/>\n&gt; when people whine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Captian, I am not certian, but it would appear <br/>\n&gt; that our forward<br/>\n&gt; shields have been reduced to almost half their normal power.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? You, you Abashi being, why are you <br/>\n&gt; doing this? We<br/>\n&gt; came to aid you and you attack us?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh gee...you are going to whine now arent you. Well, <br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; just have to call you a whiner then. Whiner!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov, arm all photon torpedo bays and fire!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a moment of scilence...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov?? Where is Mr Chekov? What have you done with<br/>\n&gt; him??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh...well we here at Verant decided that you really <br/>\n&gt; didnt need<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; All he did really was shoot your guns, so we felt for the <br/>\n&gt; sake of balance<br/>\n&gt; that you could live without the extra crewman.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Scott- &quot;Captian..I dont believe my eyes. We left dock with <br/>\n&gt; a full supply<br/>\n&gt; of dilithium crystals, and now were down to almost nothing! I dont<br/>\n&gt; understand what is going on.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Why are you doing this? Who are you really?!?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;I told you, Im Abashi from Verant X. This is my <br/>\n&gt; leader, Brad.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brad- &quot;Hi..I hope you like the new improved Enterprise!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;No I...hey, whered he go??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh, hes a very busy guy. He doesnt like to mingle <br/>\n&gt; with the lesser<br/>\n&gt; beings.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Ive had enough of this. Mr Spock, form an away <br/>\n&gt; team. Were<br/>\n&gt; going down there to meet these _things_ face to face!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few minutes later in the transporter room...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Fascinating, it would appear that half of our crew <br/>\n&gt; has vanished<br/>\n&gt; without a trace, and the only reasoning for this is the <br/>\n&gt; Abashi creatures<br/>\n&gt; word &quot;balance&quot;.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;I know Spock...but what does he mean by it? <br/>\n&gt; What sort of<br/>\n&gt; balance could he mean?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Jim, I got here as fast as I could. I had a <br/>\n&gt; patient that was<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; half there and I&#39;ll be damaned if all of my tools were missing!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Everyone put on your gasmasks...Alright Mr <br/>\n&gt; Scott, beam us<br/>\n&gt; down.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A shrill sound spurs the machine into action as Kirk, Spock, <br/>\n&gt; McCoy, and<br/>\n&gt; three nameless redshirts vanish in a sparkling mist...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Upon materializing onto the Verant X surface loud screams are heard...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Three redshirts- &quot;AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHH!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What happened?!?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;It would appear that they were instantly killed <br/>\n&gt; just as they<br/>\n&gt; materialized onto the surface.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Why? Why are we still alive? I see nothing <br/>\n&gt; around us that<br/>\n&gt; would have done this and left us here.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Theyre dead Jim.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The three survivors look around in astonishment at the unforgiving<br/>\n&gt; surroundings. Craggy rocks jutt out of the surface of the <br/>\n&gt; planet. Various<br/>\n&gt; colors of mist and gas swirl around gaping holes. Hissing <br/>\n&gt; noises and the<br/>\n&gt; bubbling of super heated liquids are the only sounds...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a very primitave intercom loud speaker, Abashi&#39;s voice <br/>\n&gt; pierces the men<br/>\n&gt; like a rusty nail...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Ok guys, how do you like our newest addition to the planet?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;You just killed three of my men damn you!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh dont start whining again please. Just get over <br/>\n&gt; it..its no big<br/>\n&gt; deal.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;No big deal? Where are you! Come out here and face us!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ..brief silence...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A sudden whirring noise is heard and McCoys arms vanish from his body,<br/>\n&gt; *poof*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;My God man! What are you doing to us!?!?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Were making it better. We know what were doing, you <br/>\n&gt; dont. I wont<br/>\n&gt; talk to you anymore if you keep insulting me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Damnit! Im a doctor not a circus freak! How can I <br/>\n&gt; operate with<br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; arms? My patience will all die!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Well, we took away your arms because you were fixing <br/>\n&gt; everyone too<br/>\n&gt; easily. BUT...we did give you three extra toes to compensate for it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Three extra toes?? How is this supposed to <br/>\n&gt; help him or us?<br/>\n&gt; Youve killed off half my crew, youve left my ship crippled <br/>\n&gt; and open to any<br/>\n&gt; attack! What sort of beings are you??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;I told you to stop telling us what is best for <br/>\n&gt; you...we know all<br/>\n&gt; about what is best.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; suddenly Mr Spock starts weeping uncontrollably....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What have you done to Spock?!?!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Nothing...we never touched him. I dont know what <br/>\n&gt; youre talking<br/>\n&gt; about, infact I think youre just making it all up so we will give you<br/>\n&gt; something for free. Your just a whiner!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Im telling you! Hes a Vulcan, he isnt supposed to cry,<br/>\n&gt; laugh,<br/>\n&gt; or have any emotions damn you!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh wait...youre right. We took out his emotions <br/>\n&gt; because we thought<br/>\n&gt; that not having any made him too effective under pressure, so now all<br/>\n&gt; Vulcans will have emotions...but they are only little ones.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock is still weeping like a baby, now curled up on the <br/>\n&gt; ground in a<br/>\n&gt; fetal position, Dr McCoy is running around bumping into walls because<br/>\n&gt; shortly after his arms were taken, his eye lids were made to <br/>\n&gt; only stay open<br/>\n&gt; for 2 minutes every 24 hours....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Damn you!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;I dont know what youre getting all upset about <br/>\n&gt; really. Its all so<br/>\n&gt; things will be better from now on. Trust us.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Scott! Beam us up now!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Scott breaks through on the comlink with a scratchy transmission...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Me Scott- &quot;Captian, Im getting an error from the transporter. <br/>\n&gt; Its telling<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; it cannot beam you up!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? Ok, Abashi...what have you done now??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh, did I forget to tell you?..you need a redshirt <br/>\n&gt; in your party<br/>\n&gt; inorder to beam in or out of here.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What?? Our men died as soon as they teleported <br/>\n&gt; down! How do<br/>\n&gt; you expect us to get out??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Abashi- &quot;I know...its quite the challenge isnt it? Heh heh heh.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mr Spock is still on the ground crying, Dr McCoy has gotten <br/>\n&gt; his leg stuck<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; some sort of crater, and Captian Kirk, sweating profusely yells....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;DAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The end?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zyrixx Daemonix<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; WANT FREE MAGAZINES?<br/>\n&gt; Sample over 500 magazines in 30 categories-- all for FREE at <br/>\n&gt; FreeShop.com, your source for thousands of free and trial offers!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/1610/5/_/_/_/951146032/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/1610/5/_/_/_/951146032/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
