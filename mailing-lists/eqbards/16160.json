I (foolishly :) tried to see if I could solo the<br/>\nfroglok noble in Lower Guk.  I got 4 attempts at it before<br/>\ngiving up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst try, I used my standard lineup - equip lute, Hymn +<br/>\nNiv&#39;s + CoC + CoD.  No good.  He nuked me to half, then<br/>\ncharmed me.  I scurried off while charmed, and when it broke I<br/>\nwas outside his aggro radius.  He didn&#39;t come after me.  But<br/>\nhis pet (whom I&#39;d damaged with my DoTs) did.  I feared them<br/>\nand made it to the zone with about a bubble left.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond try, I switched to Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC + Mystic<br/>\nShielding, on the theory that my 125 magic resist would help<br/>\nme resist some of his nukes and charm.  It worked for the<br/>\nfirst two nukes (resisted), then his third nuke took off two<br/>\nbubbles.  I feared them, ran for the zone while invis, a<br/>\nsee-invis mino attacked me, and I made it to the zone with<br/>\n138 hp left.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird try, I tried weapons + Chain + Fear.  This eliminated<br/>\nthe pet as a factor (of the two fear-paths, the priest/<br/>\ncrusader area was camped, and the area towards the maze was<br/>\nall green to me), and if I could consistently keep up<br/>\nChain/Fear, it would eliminate his spells as a factor (very<br/>\nannoying since enchanter DDs also have a stun that will<br/>\ninterrupt your songs).  Both Chain and fear ended up being<br/>\nresisted too much, he nuked me to half, then charmed me.  <br/>\nAfter the charm wore off, he was outside aggro radius, and the<br/>\npet didn&#39;t attack me again (presumably because I hadn&#39;t<br/>\ndamaged it).  I didn&#39;t have to zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth try, on the theory that I&#39;d just gotten unlucky with<br/>\nresists, I tried weapons + Chain + fear again.  Only this<br/>\ntime, I put up Mystic Shielding before pulling him (most of<br/>\nthe damage I was took before came from the first couple<br/>\nnukes).  Basically the same result - he resisted me too much<br/>\nfor this to be consistent.  Strangely enough this time, after<br/>\nI was charmed, his pet continued to attack me.  :)  Haven&#39;t<br/>\nfigured that one out.  Anyhow, because I was fighting his pet<br/>\nwhile charmed, I didn&#39;t scurry out of aggro range, and when<br/>\ncharm broke he was on me and hit me for 102 with his staff.  <br/>\nI feared them all again and made it to the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I gave up.  I didn&#39;t have enough confidence in<br/>\nmy melee to be able to Fear/Chain him consistently with his<br/>\nresist rate.  With a max melee damage of 100+, I doubted I&#39;d<br/>\nbe able to survive the occasional resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire live side of Lower Guk was empty at 7am.  No<br/>\nplayers were harmed during these tests.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
