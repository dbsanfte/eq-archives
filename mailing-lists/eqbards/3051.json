But the lack of cash is killing me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no clue what I did to give me the faction rating I have.  I<br/>\nentered Rivervale as a lowly level 2.  I hunted a bit in Faydark, then<br/>\ntraveled to Freeport ... hunted a tiny bit there but lag prevented me<br/>\nfrom getting anything good really.  I did manage to get to level 2 and<br/>\nget Discord.  And then I made the trek to Rivervale.  Perhaps it&#39;s the<br/>\ndeity I chose?  I can&#39;t remember which one I chose (although I usually<br/>\nchose the nicest sounding one, lol ... I love Tunare and will chose her<br/>\nif I have the choice).  When I arrived I conned &quot;apprehensive&quot; to every<br/>\nnpc but the innkeeper who conned disinterested but he won&#39;t sell or buy<br/>\nfrom me anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been killing bixies and those little goblin guys ... workers or<br/>\nsomething like that ... anyways, they&#39;re very similar to those annoying<br/>\ngreen men that roam everfrost.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and btw, I&#39;m a SHE not a he. &lt;g&gt;  I had to chuckle at the couple<br/>\nposts that referenced me as a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;him&quot;. ;-)  I&#39;m the cute little<br/>\nredheaded woodelf running around Rivervale (Quellious) in the *very*<br/>\nskimpy bathing suit the EQ developers dressed me in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\nWoodelf Bard, Level 3 (and a half! ;-)<br/>\nRivervale, Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nExpand in consciousness-<br/>\nbe ready to accept anything now,<br/>\nat any time.    --Eileen Caddy<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\nICQ# 1976509<br/>\nAOL IM: weya</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
