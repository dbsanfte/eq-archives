As my name is Celandro Spellsong this<br/>\nseems very suspicious to me.  So I petition the npc for having a name so<br/>\nclose to mine and the gms refuse to change it!  Seems Verant has the<br/>\nability to steal any name they think is good and pervert it to their own<br/>\nuses! So be careful Harmonic, Talies, Shada, Rokenn, and all the other<br/>\nbards on this list.. Your name may be the next to be stolen!<br/>\n<br/>\nCelandro Spellsong<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the look out for that evil npc Shala Stormblade</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
