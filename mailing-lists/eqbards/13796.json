At least they could have fixed<br/>\nit so we beat on the &#39;flute&#39; drum.  Then they&#39;d be halfway there and only<br/>\nneed to change the &#39;flute&#39; into a drum when they do a graphics patch.  Also<br/>\nunless this &#39;animations&#39; guy does other work, he&#39;s been sitting around doing<br/>\nnothing most of the time.  I doubt they have a programmer who just does<br/>\nanimations for the existing game.  If so, he put a bunch of animations in<br/>\nonce, fixed the playing while sitting, and that&#39;s about it since release.<br/>\nAlso the people who could have fixed the other things like our broken song<br/>\ndin&#39;t not fix it because of time constraints.  They didn&#39;t fix it because as<br/>\nfar as they were concerned it wasn&#39;t broken.  Once they decided it was<br/>\nbroken it got fixed pretty quickly.  Same thing with Shamanic Alchemy, etc.<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a resource issue.  All that matters is whether they think<br/>\nsomething&#39;s broken, and it takes 6+ months of customers complaints to<br/>\nconvince them that something they think works is fact broken.  That&#39;s their<br/>\nreal problem.  If we say something appears to be broken their approach is<br/>\nask some programmer if its broken, when they say no it works fine, repeat<br/>\nthat to the customer or ignore them depending on current whims.  Actually<br/>\ngetting them to test to see if it might really be broken takes a ridiculous<br/>\namount of effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody should also point out to Abashi that Microsoft doesn&#39;t put out word<br/>\nprocessors that are missing 5 letters of the alphabet when they release<br/>\nthem, and then claim they are waiting to put those in later.  His comparison<br/>\nof user complaints between Microsoft and EQ was ludicrous.  My company puts<br/>\nout software and we&#39;d for sure be getting customer complaints, in fact<br/>\nlawsuits, if we had half the bugs in our code that Verant does.  I can hear<br/>\nthe help desk now.  &quot;I know it looks like your buying a Tech fund whenever<br/>\nyou buy our Asian Growth product, but its just a graphics glitch.  We can&#39;t<br/>\nfix that in a patch right now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 2:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] WAaahooo!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, &quot;THEY&quot; are not identical modules that do generic EQ &quot;work&quot;.  The guy<br/>\nthat<br/>\ndoes the animations is not the guy who can fix our songs.  He&#39;s not the<br/>\nprogrammer that changed our Bard Taunt.

They consider it broken and that&#39;s all that<br/>\nreally matters as far as Verant is concerned.
