Tom scores again ! In 2 hours I am running &quot;The First Bardic<br/>\nBoot Camp&quot; on Caz-Thule for the Guild I just joined, House of Rising<br/>\nPhoenix. In addition to training all Bards I made up a &quot;Guide BooK&quot; that<br/>\nincludes this kind of information. I also sent an outline to the Guild<br/>\nmembers of a general &quot;Guide Book&quot; for all classes that we could give to<br/>\nMembers and new &quot;hires&quot;. I am sure that every class will want impute and<br/>\nit will be a valuable reference.
