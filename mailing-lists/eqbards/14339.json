The negativity and<br/>\nflames I can do with out BUT...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo offence almighty dictator, but I am left wondering why Harmonic is<br/>\ngetting a warning for something that was clearly a personal e-mail between<br/>\ntwo people and not this list.  SteelWolf should have never posted that to<br/>\nthe board.  It seems to me the wrong person got a warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule #2<br/>\nNo Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>\nbe considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>\nmake sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>\nall human, and no one likes to be called names.
