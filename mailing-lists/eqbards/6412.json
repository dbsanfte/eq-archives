I had never solo&#39;d a con Yellow<br/>\nmob in all my levels before that and was I think 24th or 25th at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we need to hush up about this one before it gets nerfed like the other<br/>\noverused kiting thingy - someone is going to get upset and take this edge<br/>\naway from us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras &quot;the drunken bard&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci (26th for 3rd week now, but I can brew a mean load of Fish Wine)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: CYR, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 13, 1999 11:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] re: Fear/Chain, is not cheesy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;CYR, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; speaking of fear/chain, i was running to rathe mountains and <br/>\n&gt; on my way from<br/>\n&gt; freeport saw a ranger getting wooped by Dorn... well well <br/>\n&gt; well payback time.<br/>\n&gt; I start pounding away at him with my normal buff songs and <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s doing about<br/>\n&gt; the same damage as i am than he is to me, well to hell with <br/>\n&gt; this, i chain<br/>\n&gt; him down and fear him, so i took off about half his health <br/>\n&gt; using fear, this<br/>\n&gt; tactic is great against cyclops when ya get a druid to snare <br/>\n&gt; it, then fear<br/>\n&gt; it and just pound away. Its sad when a level 14 npc is <br/>\n&gt; pounding the hell out<br/>\n&gt; of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances <br/>\n&gt; with him. And<br/>\n&gt; upon zoning into Sro afterwards, i saw terrorantula, but was <br/>\n&gt; alone and not<br/>\n&gt; taking any chances against it, since i would have needed to <br/>\n&gt; charm a giant<br/>\n&gt; against it so it was too dangerous for me and my untrusty ISP.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nothing kills me more then my connectivity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; Sol ro<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 31st level<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBETA TEST expertcity.com&#39;s new online, real-time, technical support service!<br/>\n   Let our live experts help you with your computer now.
