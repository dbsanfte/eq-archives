I too will /feedback the surf-nerf every time I log on, which may<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of folks are having the EQ Blues.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2. Great.  Now I can look forward to being a portable manastone.  Yay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah kinda. Do you know what a mana stone is worth? And you can regen<br/>\n5 casters where a stone can only do one at a time (yeah, they do get passed<br/>\naround but still.)  Maybe it takes 35 to 40 levels for it to finally &#39;sink<br/>\nin&#39; or maybe mid levels is where the classes are finally maturing into more<br/>\ndistinct entities and their roles in groups are better defined because they<br/>\nhave acquired their main powers.  And for bard that means a few specific<br/>\nthings:<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimary:  Mana regen;  Melee buff (Berzerker Krashendo!  Woo hoo!); MR/CR/HR<br/>\nbuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondary: Melee attack (&quot;with dual Yk&#39;s you do a fair amount of damage<br/>\n[said in a surprized tone]&quot;); after combat healing; misc duties to supplant<br/>\na missing primary (crowd control, chain/snare/root, debuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while it seems like you are &#39;forced&#39; into a niche, it really is an<br/>\nimportant role.  Once you get to the point where you are in a group that has<br/>\nsynergy (the whole is greater than the sum of the parts), I think you will<br/>\nbe happy with the results.  A good, well balanced group that has experience<br/>\nworking together can do some amazing things (like survive so hairy fights<br/>\n[&#39;OMG!  we lived!!!&#39;])  And 2 or 3 good groups working together can do some<br/>\namazing things. Dungeon crawl the old fashion way: Kedge Keep - 3 groups,<br/>\nclear to the boss, win and gate out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT un happy being the &quot;portable mana-stone&quot; at all.  My groups love<br/>\nme!  &quot;Hooray!  we get the bard!!!&quot;  &quot;Oh good!  My bard is here!&quot; &quot;Great, we<br/>\nwill have lots less downtime now...&quot; &quot;King room looking for a Bard or<br/>\nEnchanter!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
