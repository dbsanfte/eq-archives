It&#39;s not an elitist attitude.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s simply the design of the game that people your level<br/>\naren&#39;t supposed to be getting lambent armor.  If you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it, then either you need to gain a few more levels, or<br/>\nyou&#39;re playing the wrong game.  If you&#39;re suggesting that you<br/>\ndeserve the armor at L22, then I suggest you email Verant<br/>\nstating your reasons why you think a L22 bard should be able<br/>\nto complete some relatively simple quests for armor that in<br/>\nsome cases is better than that dropped by L35-40 mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat people are really griping about is that there are in fact<br/>\nways around the in-game limitations to what &quot;level&quot; of<br/>\nequipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>\nlike to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a bunch<br/>\nof people who like to play the monty-haul-start-off-with-the-<br/>\nbest-of-everything game.  Unfortunately, we all have them<br/>\nplaying in the same universe.  If you were playing a pen and<br/>\npaper RPG and found the group playing in a style you didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike, you&#39;d pack up and find another group.  That&#39;s where the<br/>\nresentment and bitterness comes from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat and Verant only taking half-measures to clearly define<br/>\nexactly what type of game they want.  This is another of those<br/>\nall-or-nothing issues.  Either you place no restrictions on<br/>\nthose wanting to play monty-haul, or you do everything you can<br/>\nto stop them.  Taking half-measures like proc level limits and<br/>\nmaking some items no-drop just legitimizes the gripes of<br/>\nanti-monty-haul players, while not really getting in the way<br/>\nof monty-haul players.  You create an issue where none<br/>\nwould&#39;ve existed in-game if you&#39;d gone the all-or-nothing<br/>\nroute.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
