Bards are better than Paladins/Rangers in spell combat. If you have any doubt of the above","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1124350951\">Bards are better than Clerics/Druids/Shaman in melee combat.<br/>\nBards are better than Paladins/Rangers in spell combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any doubt of the above statements, duel one using just combat or<br/>\nspells where appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany (most) of the Bard songs improve the entire group.  A solo Bard is like<br/>\nfighting with one arm tied behind your back.  Comparing Bards to any other<br/>\nclass in solo capabilities is not a fair comparison of the overall<br/>\npowerfulness of a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard songs will never be as magically powerful as other casters (pure and<br/>\npriest types).  But Bards have a huge advantage of never needed mana (lvl 43<br/>\nsong excepted).  It is not a fair to compare the effectiveness of a bard<br/>\nsong which can be repeated as much as needed to a spell which comsumes mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>\nunderstand these facts.  If you base your discussion on something to the<br/>\ncontrary, your whole logic chain falls apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
