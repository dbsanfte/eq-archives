The<br/>\nspeeds of the weapons are irrelevant.  If one weapon is better<br/>\nthan another in your primary hand, then it is also better in<br/>\nyour secondary hand.  Yes the faster weapon gets more dual<br/>\nwield checks, but this is exactly canceled out by the lower<br/>\ndamage of the faster weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you have a 6/23 weapon and a 12/45 weapon, and after<br/>\ncomparing both in your primary hand you find the 12/45 weapon<br/>\ndoes 1.1x as much damage as the 6/23 weapon, then the 12/45<br/>\nweapon is better, whether in the primary or secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure you check with a logfile parser first though.  There<br/>\nare nonlinearities in the combat system which make is so a<br/>\n6/23 weapon is not equal to a 12/46 weapon despite the ratios<br/>\nbeing the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
