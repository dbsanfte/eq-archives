My bard has 100 days played and is level 42 (hoping to ding 43 tonight!) but my times are badly  skewed by many nights of falling sleep","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-970198832\">Greetings and Welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bard has &gt;100 days played and is level 42 (hoping to ding 43 tonight!)<br/>\nbut my times are badly  skewed by many nights of falling sleep while zoning<br/>\nor camping or running or simply staying up far too late.  And I spend a lot<br/>\nof my time doing non-exp stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy close fiends who were pretty much power gamers got their first 50 chars<br/>\nthere in about 40 days played. They spent 95% of their time killing mobs for<br/>\nxp.  They did a few quests for good equipment and one night actually did<br/>\nsomething social.  But most of the time they were simply focused on killing<br/>\nstuff for xp.  In fact they re-started chars to have a better balanced group<br/>\nand played all night - every night.  They had wizard chars that could<br/>\ntele-port the group at will.  If Unrest was camped, we tele&#39;d to CT or<br/>\nSol-A. Downtime was very minimal.  And one is a master jeweler who made lots<br/>\nof money and funded many things.  Everyone was always symbol buffed. We got<br/>\nto the point where there was nothing left to buy (yes, even tinkers bags.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA lev 50 in my guild has gotten his halfling warrior twink to 47 in under 10<br/>\ndays played.  He has 2 PC&#39;s so he can play both char&#39;s at the same time and<br/>\nhas been doing some serious twinking with equipment and weps as well a exp<br/>\ncamps.  And he says he is really liking the halfling warrior so much he may<br/>\nmake it his primary.  This guy is obviously quite good and very<br/>\nknowledgeable about mobs and such.  And he has preserved his factions in<br/>\nOgg.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I say &quot;I really need to level - I want to beat so-and-so to level<br/>\n45...&quot;  I get told &quot;relax, who cares about other&#39;s levels - play the game<br/>\nfor your own enjoyment.&quot;  Much of the game is very tedious.  Especially if<br/>\nyou are simply trying to get xp to make a level.  In fact, the better you<br/>\nget or more powerfull your group, the more tedious it becomes.  For sheer<br/>\nterror, you need to be on the edge and stretching your limits.  My high 20&#39;s<br/>\nwere loads more exciting than what I do now.  I am looking at some really<br/>\nboring hours until I can get to 46+ and venture into the planes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut knowing where to go and what to kill and some of the techniques - really<br/>\nhelps alot.  Also having a good guild and regular group makes a world of<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David Nolle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dnolle@...\">dnolle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 10:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Play Time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: David Nolle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dnolle@...\">dnolle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>\n&gt; since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that<br/>\nanyone<br/>\n&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got<br/>\nthree<br/>\n&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>\n&gt; Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>\n&gt; Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>\n&gt; I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>\n&gt; characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>\n&gt; than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just<br/>\nbloody<br/>\n&gt; well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;           Windsinger Legendmaker on Innorouk<br/>\n&gt;                The Wayward Travelers<br/>\n&gt;   Friends are a Bard&#39;s Best Defense!<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
