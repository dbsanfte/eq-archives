Be close enough to \r<br/>\nyour target that it works but not so close they respond to you.\r<br/>\nTarget one then play the song.  they should glow purple similar\r<br/>\nto the accelerando aura and be sad.  I have yet to get this to work\r<br/>\non more then one target.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor money te best options are Wisps which themselves are of\r<br/>\nmoderate worth, their lightstones range from 1-5pp depending on\r<br/>\nthe type. Dervish thieves also have bronze weapons yeilding about 3 plat.\r<br/>\nWith a good set of friends you can try gluck and get netted and woven armor\r<br/>\nto sell to monks and wizards,magician,necros. For around 5 plat.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 20 May 1999 11:01:36 -0700 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      Hello all,\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \t A couple of questions from a new bard on your list. (I apologize\r<br/>\n&gt;      if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most\r<br/>\n&gt;      interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must\r<br/>\n&gt;      say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.\r<br/>\n&gt;      (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?\tIs it an area\r<br/>\n&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step\r<br/>\n&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group\r<br/>\n&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the\r<br/>\n&gt;      Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal\r<br/>\n&gt;      population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing\r<br/>\n&gt;      Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.\r<br/>\n&gt;      I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some\r<br/>\n&gt;      experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter\r<br/>\n&gt;      (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am\r<br/>\n&gt;      rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a\r<br/>\n&gt;      goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      Thanks in advance,\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;      Bujold (Xegony) (look no e.. :))\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!\r<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a>\r<br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
