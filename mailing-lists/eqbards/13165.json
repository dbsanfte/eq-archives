I have refined numbers/stats<br/>\n  since then, if I did post.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cleric of Innoruuk in the PoH has approximately 15000 hps,<br/>\n  as do most common mobs in there do (14k-17k).  So give or<br/>\n  take a few thousand.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It takes about a minute I&#39;d say to drop one on average.<br/>\n  Once I saw one drop in 30 secs, but Tashani + Malosi + ICs<br/>\n  were the reason I believe.  I&#39;ll use a nice round 60 secs<br/>\n  for this discussion.  At any given second during the 60 secs,<br/>\n  the Cleric would be taking an average 250 dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 250dmg/sec and a casting time of 10 seconds for complete<br/>\n  healing, thats 2500dmg that the NPC would have to cast through.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The most I&#39;ve heard a player cast through was recently in the PoF<br/>\n  and it was 600 dmg, and that was a druid gating (a 5 second casting<br/>\n  spell).  His channeling was maxxed at 200.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If 600 dmg is to 200 channelling, then 2500 dmg is to 833 chanelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Needless to say through all the slamming, bashing, pixie&#39;s we stuck<br/>\n  to him, he regained and completely healed.  Damn those NPCs with<br/>\n  800+ channelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
