The agro range of the mobs there is extremely large and there<br/>\nis no buffer whatsoever between where you zone in and the toughest mobs up<br/>\nthere.  There is often a latency of many seconds between the time that you<br/>\nappear in a zone and the time that you are actually given control of the<br/>\ncharacter.  This is killing many, many players.  Discussion on the Guide board<br/>\nhas addressed this, and ideas has been forwarded to the Senior Guides and<br/>\nhopefully to the Developers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re right - Fear, Air, Hate, etc. should be very difficult.  Whether it<br/>\nshould be more difficult than taking out Nagefen or Vox, I dunno...<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 21st song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.

I feel for those<br/>\n&gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.  It<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a new<br/>\n&gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Bard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 4:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of losses<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A &quot;gm exursion&quot;, eh?
