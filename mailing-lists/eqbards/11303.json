The other thing worth considering is, if you could<br/>\nhave (1) item, what would it be off a dragon? I&#39;m sure opinions vary,<br/>\nbut for my guild we generally shoot for everyone getting one dragon/god<br/>\ndrop before we start getting 2-3 for select people. I firmly agree with<br/>\nthis policy, and I was a recipient of a special drop 2 months ago in our<br/>\nfirst victory over Lord Nagafen. I received Selo&#39;s Drums of the March.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also had alot of other nifty things drop off other monsters since,<br/>\nbut there is no way I&#39;d pass up my drums for anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to keep in mind, is who can best use an item. Part of the<br/>\nproblem, like Harmonic said, is that wizard who sees that Earthcrafter<br/>\nis tradeable (druid staff recently fixed from +15 int [duh] to +15 wis,<br/>\ncommon drop on Cazic Thule), and wants in the lotto so he can give it to<br/>\nhis L1 druid. umm, yuck. I really don&#39;t care if people twink other<br/>\ncharacters with items they take their own time getting, but to my<br/>\nknowledge, no one has solo&#39;d a god or dragon yet. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nOn things like this belt, who could best use it would clearly be a<br/>\nmelee-intensive class, such as warrior, monk, or hybrid (I don&#39;t include<br/>\nBard because of our limited melee damage potential at higher levels [no<br/>\ndouble attack]). Bards get a very minimal damage bonus from additional<br/>\nstrength, while an SK, PAL, WAR get several points for the same bonus.<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t want to stir up any controversy by saying that, that is<br/>\nsimply how I see it. Any caster being involved in that lotto is as<br/>\nabsurd as a druid wearing a FBSS and thinking he is a tank *laugh* (ask<br/>\nthe L50s how many druids they know with FBSS though *sigh*). (FBSS =<br/>\nFlowing Black Silk Sash, effect: haste). Alot of the drops off<br/>\ndragons/gods are either very class/race restrictive, or all/all. We also<br/>\nneed to kep in mind so many things are Bard usuable, just because we are<br/>\nversatile.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a level of trust to handle loot such that the most appropriate<br/>\nrecipient gets it, it&#39;s one step up from what classes could reasonably<br/>\nuse it. If this was with groups from several guilds, or with people that<br/>\ndon&#39;t normally play together, for completeness I&#39;d say you should<br/>\ninclude any class that could reasonably use the belt (so Bards should<br/>\nhave been in it too, but not finger wagglers, all/all be darned).<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell the Long-Winded, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Would I bark if I wasnt included in the roll for such a belt?<br/>\n&gt;   Probably.  Would it ruin my day?  No way.  If a person wanted<br/>\n&gt;   it for a secondary or other toon not present in the raid, I<br/>\n&gt;   would chuckle at them.  And I&#39;m sure everyone else would too.<br/>\n&gt;   Dragon loot just doesn&#39;t work like that ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
