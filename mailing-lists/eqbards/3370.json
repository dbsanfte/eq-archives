In addition to cold based protection, it acts as a fireshield for <br/>\neverybody in the group. Everytime a monster hits you, they get damage done <br/>\nto them, at lvl 40 the damage is 6. Great song while fighting multiple <br/>\nmonsters, and is in someways better than discord since it doesnt concentrate <br/>\nall the monsters energy on you, since its not you thats doing the damage to <br/>\nthem, its the person that they are hitting :). It also seems to give <br/>\ninfravision erratically, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt, not too <br/>\nsure about that part. But the damage shield is for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 26: Angstlich\u0012s Apalling Screech<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Effects: NON-PARTY: Fear<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Brass Instruments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Location: Kelethin <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Notes: Warning: area effect song<br/>\n&gt;Rating: [not rated]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: Will cause all monsters in it\u0012s path to flee in <br/>\n&gt;terror, but only for about a minute or so, then they will come back. This is <br/>\n&gt;a useful song if your party is trying to run, but failing, or if a party <br/>\n&gt;member, unable to run, is about to die. This is an area effect Fear spell, <br/>\n&gt;mentioned as a &quot;get out of death free&quot; song, if used at the right time. Just <br/>\n&gt;make sure that your party zones after using this song to avoid problems when <br/>\n&gt;fear wears off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually its most usefull when fighting outdoors with another bard or <br/>\nsomebody that can ensnare. That way the mob is always fleeing at a very slow <br/>\nrate and unable to attack you, while you get hit, after hit, after hit on <br/>\nits backside. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 29: Psalm of Vitality<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Effects: PARTY: Protection from disease and Poison<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Singing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rating: [not rated]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: [none]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure if this one provides a damage shield, cause i havent had time to <br/>\npick it up, but i suspect it does and im eager to go get it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 33: Psalm of Cooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Effects: PARTY: +Fire Resistance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Singing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Location: Any<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rating: [not rated]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same for this one, havent had time to go pick it up (its not in freeport <br/>\nthat i can find). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 34: Lyssa\u0012s Solidarity of Vision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Effects: TARGET: See through targets eyes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Wind Instruments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Location: Erudin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rating: [not rated]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unconfirmed Analysis: <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great for when you want to see where the tank is pulling from so you can<br/>\npull for yourself<br/>\nlater.

Without a drum,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Fire Resistance by 14.
