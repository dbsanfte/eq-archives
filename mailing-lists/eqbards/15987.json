I&#39;m trying to figure out a simpler way to<br/>\n&gt; do this that automatically incorporates the weighting without<br/>\n&gt; requiring you to do the math.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this is what we do.  it isn&#39;t most points wins.  we just added a new tier<br/>\nfor people with 5+ points over the point value of the item.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also suggested scaling the points down so people who go to a<br/>\n&gt; lot of these events don&#39;t have an overwhelming advantage over<br/>\n&gt; people who can&#39;t go as often.  If you have 1-10 points, each<br/>\n&gt; dragon/god trip is worth 1 point.  If you have 11-20 points,<br/>\n&gt; you need two trips to gain an extra point.  If you have 21-30,<br/>\n&gt; you need three trips per point.  etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>our officers disagreed here apparently.  they feel those who put in the most<br/>\ntime should have a large advantage over those who don&#39;t.  more time should<br/>\nequal more items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Planes armor should be relatively simple if you can trust the<br/>\n&gt; people there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this is also what we have done recently.  we are relying more on an honor<br/>\nsystem for armor loot.  e.g. a cleric in our guild, one of the first 50s on<br/>\nthe server, and spending 6 months in the planes, had still not gotten legs<br/>\nor bracers.  meanwhile, every other newly 50 cleric was coming up and<br/>\nreaping tons of cleric armor, including items he needed.  this kinda forced<br/>\nus to reevaluate how to distribute armor.  soon after, legs dropped and<br/>\nanother cleric there who needed them but was not in the planes nearly as<br/>\nlong gladly allowed the veteran cleric to loot.  unfortunately, looks like<br/>\nTyria may have to sit out some carmine lottos =)<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L46 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
