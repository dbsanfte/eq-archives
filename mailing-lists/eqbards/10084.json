And<br/>\n&gt; what about a small<br/>\n&gt; brass trumpet?  How do I get one of those?  I have<br/>\n&gt; seen the parts, but<br/>\n&gt; unless I missed something, I have not see an<br/>\n&gt; assembled small brass trumpet?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the info<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kerouac Dharmabum lvl 25<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s.  low 20&#39;s, try the deepwater doggies in lake<br/>\n&gt; rathe -- great exp, but no<br/>\n&gt; loot!!!
