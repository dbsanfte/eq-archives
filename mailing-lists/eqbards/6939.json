I can&#39;t believe<br/>\nthat any of these get taken seriously by Verant.<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I propose:  Let&#39;s put together a small list of our biggest<br/>\ncomplaints over the next couple of days.  After we&#39;ve hashed them out a bit,<br/>\nI&#39;ll mail them on to Geoffrey Zatkin.  I got a pretty prompt reply out of<br/>\nhim last time I sent him some questions, so maybe we can get some answers<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I will not do is send a list of complaints or demands.  All I want is<br/>\nanswers to when/if certain things will be fixed/implemented.  I don&#39;t want<br/>\nthis to turn into a bitch fest.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to demand new skills or songs, the primary concern is to get<br/>\nthings fixed that are currently broken or missing.  I feel these issues<br/>\nshould be addressed before we go asking for new features.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll get the ball rolling with my standard list of gripes.  If you have any<br/>\nsuggestion/changes/additions, please post them, and lets get some discussion<br/>\ngoing. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>\ngame.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>\nthey are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>\nat least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>\nget them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>\nquesting for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Several of our skills (Hiding, Sneak, Forage, Instill Doubt) cap at such<br/>\nlow levels, that they aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of<br/>\nthese, but if the caps were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>\n1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>\neffect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>\ndoes not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>\nit protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>\nthis song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>\nlooks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>\npatch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>\nregularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>\nexpect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>\nequipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>\nwrists.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>\nimplementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my primary concerns.  In addition, but IMHO less important, but<br/>\nopen for discussion:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>\nmonsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?  Is this<br/>\nintentional or a bug?  <br/>\n<br/>\nb) When a magical effect wears off (i.e. Guise of the Deciever) our songs<br/>\nget stuck.  The /st command does not unstick them in this situation and we<br/>\nhave to resort to speed mashing of the buttons to unstick them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, guess that&#39;s about it.  I&#39;m fairly confident that if we put together a<br/>\nwell-worded message to GZ, we&#39;ll at least get a reply.  Heck, he responded<br/>\nto me in less than a day last time.  I&#39;m not expecting any instant fixes,<br/>\nI&#39;ll be happy just getting some answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease offer up any suggestions you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 41 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
