I never saw much good<br/>\ncasual grouping happen on Tarrew Marr for the Unrest basement, but Cazic<br/>\nwas always great for it. I guess it also depends when you play. When I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t working I&#39;d log in in the day time and usually there&#39;d only be 4<br/>\nor 5 people in Cazic so it made sense to group. Was also fun because we<br/>\nended up with some very weird combo groups then, composed of whoever<br/>\nhappened to be there. That made it fun for me because I could try<br/>\ndifferent song combos to see what was more effective for these weird<br/>\nclass groupings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
