Memmed in Lullaby - AE or not we will see how it works here.  It<br/>\nworked real well on the next couple multi-mob situations.  Now how to get<br/>\nthese 17,18,19 lev tanks to attack the same mob and not each try to fight<br/>\ntheir own.  Even so I was nodding 3 ghouls and a lurking mummy while they<br/>\nwhacked down the 2 dry bones.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond dedth: a bad train bounced us as we were in combat - we were pulling<br/>\nto the wall from the back room and a skel monk and his dbs pals got behind<br/>\nus while we were fighting ghouls.  It happens - like a bad roll.  Gotta keep<br/>\nwatchin more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird dedth: a bad idea.  Well, the Lullaby worked so well lets try Denon&#39;s<br/>\nand a horn.  I bet I can stand here near the tunnel entrance (solo) and kill<br/>\noff several dedth beetles while doing damage to dry and dark bones these<br/>\nguys are pulling off trains.  Oh yeah looking real good - that skellie is<br/>\nreally in a world of hurt - I bet next tick or two and ill get the kill.<br/>\nHmm where is the next update? Am I lagging? wtf?? Only a sliver of hp???<br/>\nRu.....Loading, Please Wait...<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 22st song<br/>\nSelling Swords and Such<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
