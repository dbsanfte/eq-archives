I knew that druids and necros<br/>\noften did it, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis certainly explains a lot, though.  Sooner or later, most of those<br/>\nsoloers get a taste for toys that lures them into dungeons, where they<br/>\nproceed to be completely useless members of a group, wasting a slot and<br/>\noften getting the group killed through sheer lack of ability to play their<br/>\nclass in a group setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving grown up as a bard, I didn&#39;t get to see these bards in action.  I<br/>\nmean, how often do you see two bards in a dungeon group?  However, now that<br/>\nI&#39;m playing an enchanter, I get to see lots of bards.  And what I see often<br/>\ndisturbs me.  They sing haste, even though it doesn&#39;t stack with my haste.<br/>\nThey sing dots in an attempt to do as much damage as possible (soloing<br/>\nattitude, I&#39;m guessing).  They start chaining the mob at the beginning of<br/>\nthe combat.  They practice instill doubt during combat.  They pull out<br/>\ninstruments at innapropriate times.  They cry like children when you ask<br/>\nthem to play mana.  Ask them to keep 2 targets mezzed and they look at you<br/>\nfunny.  In short, the bards I&#39;m grouping with seem so clueless about their<br/>\nclass that they&#39;re actually detrimental to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre these the bards who grew up kiting, charm-kiting or duoing?  When I<br/>\nplayed a bard, I saw how a bard who wasn&#39;t interested in outdamaging the<br/>\nwarriors could uplift a group and make them able to do great things.  The<br/>\nbards I group with now can&#39;t even understand why aggroing a mob is a bad<br/>\nthing, and don&#39;t put those actions together with the cleric shouting OOM and<br/>\nthe resulting evac/run for the zone/death.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of a sad thing to see, really.  And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m harder on the<br/>\nbard class than on others I see not being played very well, because I grew<br/>\nup as one.  But it really is painful and disheartening that when I see two<br/>\nor three people shouting for a group, and one of them is a bard...  Out of<br/>\nhard-learned experience, I&#39;ll take one of the other two people over the<br/>\nbard.  If I know the bard, and know that s/he is a good one, I&#39;ll add him or<br/>\nher to the group.  But if all 3 are strangers, the bard almost never wins.<br/>\nSucks if I pass up a great bard who would have made the night fly by with<br/>\ntons of xp and fun, but the odds are against it.  Chances are the bard is<br/>\none of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t be very helpful in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrei - retired 50 bard (Sacred Fyre - Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\neGroups Sponsor\t<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmail/S=1700056\">http://rd.yahoo.com/M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmail/S=1700056</a><br/>\n560:N/A=567142/R=1/*<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://domains.yahoo.com\">http://domains.yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmail/S=1700056\">http://rd.yahoo.com/M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmail/S=1700056</a><br/>\n560:N/A=567142/R=2/*<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://domains.yahoo.com\">http://domains.yahoo.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.  \t<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.adserver.yahoo.com/l?M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmai\">http://us.adserver.yahoo.com/l?M=176325.1307935.2900315.1248727/D=egroupmai</a><br/>\nl/S=1700056560:N/A=567142/rand=779078703&gt; \t<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
