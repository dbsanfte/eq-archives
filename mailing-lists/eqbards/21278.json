Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if pre-release hype is any indication, then Anarchy Online is going to<br/>\nbe a really good game.  AO will have one feature that looks very promising<br/>\nin regards to quests.  When a player/group receives a quest, then a special<br/>\ndungeon (or whatever term they will use in AO) will be created that only the<br/>\nplayer/group who recieved the quest can enter.  No camping for items,<br/>\nfighting over spawn points, or killstealing concerns.  This feature will<br/>\npromote dungeon crawling as a standard form of adventuring.  The only<br/>\nproblem is that there are no bards in AO, which I guess is appropriate since<br/>\nit is a science fiction setting.  AO is in beta now and should be released<br/>\nbefore year end.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely candidate replacement for EQ for those who like to play bards is<br/>\nUO2.  The developers haven&#39;t released a lot of details on skills, but they<br/>\nhave said that there will be over 1000 different skills.  You would think<br/>\nthat a few of those skills are bardic in nature.  One thing they have<br/>\nconfirmed is that players will be able to select specific &quot;leadership&quot;<br/>\nskills which will convey a bonus to all the other players in the group.  So<br/>\nthat means that the base code does contain ways for a player to affect/buff<br/>\nthe entire party.  I subscribe to the UO2 developers mailing list and bards<br/>\nin UWOO (thats what it is actually called not UO2) is a popular topic.  If<br/>\nOSI/EA releases specific info on how bards will work in UWOO, I&#39;ll forward<br/>\nthem to this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCorrection:  I&#39;ll do some Wall-hunting in Qeynos until I get banned, THEN I<br/>\nwill check on UO (or maybe AC)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
