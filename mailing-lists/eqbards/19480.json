Actually a couple things change for you over the<br/>\nnext 10 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, resists are checked against level difference.  Try it on some<br/>\nblues and it should work better.  I tried it on Broon my first time out and<br/>\nwas very dissappointed in the results - resisted fear and denon&#39;s - I gave<br/>\nup until 35+ when I went after Aviak Avocets with a vengence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, as you go up in levels so do the mobs.  They hit a whole lot<br/>\nharder.  So, you really can&#39;t stand toe-toe with mobs like you used to.  You<br/>\nneed to fear them off and attack them when they are not hitting you.  But<br/>\nyou need to have a level difference advantage and need to have the song for<br/>\na few levels for it to really gain power. Also, finding the &quot;right&quot; mobs -<br/>\nones with low magic hence song resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it gets better - I am sorry I missed what I think would have been a lot<br/>\nof good opportunities.  I tried it when i first got the song - had poor<br/>\nresults and ignored it for too many levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bill Costlow&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 07, 2000 8:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] fear kiting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve only had screech for a little while but have<br/>\n&gt; found that two or three resists and I take huge<br/>\n&gt; amounts of damage from a very angry mob when fear<br/>\n&gt; kiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do these songs get better over time or am I doomed to<br/>\n&gt; resist hell?
