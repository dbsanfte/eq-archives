February 1, 3178-- ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-770014947\">April 24th, 6:00am<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Press Release***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFIRIONA VIE, Kunark. February 1, 3178--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining<br/>\ncommunication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail<br/>\nroute to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean,<br/>\nsouth and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer<br/>\nto the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry<br/>\nand battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King<br/>\nTearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter<br/>\nof the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be<br/>\nnamed the Iksar. The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High<br/>\nPaladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his<br/>\ndaughter to him, lest Veredeth&#39;s life be forfeited for failure. &quot;I cannot<br/>\nallow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the<br/>\nKoada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny,&quot; says King Tearis Thex.<br/>\n&quot;Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not<br/>\nbe outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power. The source<br/>\nsaid, &quot;We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just<br/>\nthat. If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that<br/>\nthey can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is<br/>\nnot without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently<br/>\nslaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined<br/>\nship in the Oasis of Marr. They evidently were not aware that the ship would<br/>\narrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle<br/>\nfrom Oggok and Grobb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDruidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present<br/>\nthroughout the new lands. &quot;The land appears to have been ravaged by some<br/>\nviscous magical storms at one time,&quot; said one follower of Karana. &quot;Some<br/>\nmagics that we have come to count on just do not work.&quot; This phenomenon was<br/>\napparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored<br/>\nto be inhabited by followers of Veeshan. &quot;Only through divine intervention<br/>\ndid I escape that place with my life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe League of Antonican Bards&#39; representative in Kunark met with Galeth<br/>\nVeredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via. &quot;It is my sincerest hope that<br/>\nmany adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the<br/>\nPrincess to her home,&quot; says Veredeth. &quot;Though the dangers in these new lands<br/>\nare formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else<br/>\nthan to reap the spoils.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n###<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Kunark Goes Live*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn&#39;t to your<br/>\nliking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of<br/>\nKunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers. Adventurers who<br/>\nhave installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit<br/>\nthe new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access<br/>\nKunark-related content in general.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have<br/>\nupgraded:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Players may now reach level 60!<br/>\n- Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br/>\n- Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br/>\n- All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process<br/>\nof rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark<br/>\ncreatures are still being worked on. In other words, you might hear a giant<br/>\nmosquito &quot;walk&quot; by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human<br/>\nwhen he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work<br/>\nrequired with a couple of the starting Iksar quests. This may cause you to<br/>\nreach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest. This will not<br/>\nhowever cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free<br/>\nto explore these new quests. We will be finishing them over the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the<br/>\npast couple of weeks while we&#39;ve readied EverQuest for this awesome event.<br/>\nIt has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for<br/>\nlaunch, and your support has been instrumental in this process. We&#39;d also<br/>\nlike to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content<br/>\nmanaged to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while<br/>\nworking to make the game better for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark<br/>\nCD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the<br/>\nshipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nApril 24th, 6:01am<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*K-Patch Required*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program<br/>\ncontrol panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Manual Supplement*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your<br/>\nEverQuest directory are now obsolete.
