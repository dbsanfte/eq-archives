Malaising this thing and putting a<br/>\n  poison DoT on it only gonna piss it off and it&#39;s still gonna be <br/>\n  pounding the crap out of someone.  We had a cleric for healing,<br/>\n  the shaman would be more efficient as a buff and debuff tool imo.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Party dynamics and monster randomness create many different <br/>\n  scenarios which you, the bard or enchanter, need to pick up<br/>\n  on and adapt quickly to.  Having the shaman finish at 20m and<br/>\n  the cleric at 80m creates downtime.  I try to (and this is tough)<br/>\n  based on the mob fought and group makeup, determine the best <br/>\n  role for everyone.  Am I perfect at it?  No way.  But it helps<br/>\n  everyone in the long run if they try things out.  I am always<br/>\n  open to suggestions, although I usually receive very little <br/>\n  input.  (Due to the more commanding role maybe?)  I am always<br/>\n  on the ball when I play, so much so that people are like can<br/>\n  you please play the manasong... and I&#39;m like that&#39;s what you&#39;ve<br/>\n  been hearing for the last 5 mins &lt;g&gt;.  Some people just cannot<br/>\n  keep up with us sometimes.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
