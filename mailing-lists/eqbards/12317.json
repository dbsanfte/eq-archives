A 50 cleric res on one corpse got me back<br/>\nto just over 3.5 bubbles though.

That it was<br/>\ndifficult to tell if the level 31 drop was really bigger than the level 30<br/>\ndrop since the level 30 bubbles are so much bigger than the level 31 ones.<br/>\nSince I saw a bigger drop across levels on non-hell levels (or are they<br/>\nmini-hell levels?)

It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; 30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>\n&gt; decorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely<br/>\nappeared<br/>\n&gt; that he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; dropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when<br/>\npart<br/>\n&gt; of the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then you&#39;re trying to compare level 30 bubbles to level 31<br/>\nbubbles, which is literally apples to oranges.  You have to<br/>\ncompare using the same units.  In my anecdote and my take on<br/>\nyour anecdote, it was level 30 bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll you&#39;ve really shown is that level 30 bubbles are a lot<br/>\nbigger than level 31 bubbles, which we already know since<br/>\nlevel 30 a hell level.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
