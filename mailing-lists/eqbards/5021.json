If anyone else want to test this out or has similar experience with<br/>\nthis, let us know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a typical strategy for me when visiting unrest to go invis right<br/>\noutside the zone, zone in, restart the song, and start shouting for a group<br/>\nand wandering around the courtyard and walls.  This way I would be left<br/>\nalone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with<br/>\nsomething like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join<br/>\nthem, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from<br/>\nthe basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.  Not<br/>\nanymore :-(  Looks like this Bard needs to learn to be a bit more careful<br/>\nfrom now on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
