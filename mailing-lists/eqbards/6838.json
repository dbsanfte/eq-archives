Then he ran away (due to the skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working).  Huh?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow, I am REALLY impressed.

When you beg from a mage pet... does it<br/>\n&gt; give you anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have yet to succeed at it, as my skill is only 1.  :-)  I<br/>\ndid get that 1 point on a failure, so skill gain does not seem<br/>\nto be success-based.  I just thought some of the NPC behavior<br/>\nI&#39;d seen after begging was odd.  Hmm, I have 104 skill points<br/>\nsitting unused.  Maybe I&#39;ll dump some into begging...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe that sneak works for other classes (monk and bard) but only rogues<br/>\n&gt; get the success and failure messages associated with it.  Given the bard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very low sneak scores, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re just failing your sneak all<br/>\n&gt; the time, rather than the skill not working.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I was succeeding.  I tested it by seeing how slowly I was<br/>\nmoving.  I&#39;m curious how they&#39;ve implemented it if it&#39;s not<br/>\nbased on factions.  Maybe it&#39;s based on aggro radius?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I should check is if we can do the hide-sneak<br/>\ncombo that rogues get.  I&#39;ve heard only rogues can do this,<br/>\nbut I have to wonder if people just say that because only<br/>\nrogues have a high enough hide/sneak cap to pull it off<br/>\nconsistently.  (If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, if a<br/>\nrogue successfully hides, then successfully sneaks, he can<br/>\nmove while hidden.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, playing around with these useless skills does make<br/>\ntime on the boat pass more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
