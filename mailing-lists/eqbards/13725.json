On the one<br/>\nhand - less &quot;new&quot; stuff has been added for 46-.  Overcrowding issues aside;<br/>\nfor the majority of us, there is enough &quot;stuff&quot; for 46- to do.  Overcrowding<br/>\nissues aside - there needs to be more &quot;stuff&quot; for 46+ to do.  Maybe not<br/>\neveryone will agree with me on this - but I strongly believe it to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Perhaps if you play the game A LOT (more than I do) and are doing a<br/>\nsecond character - you&#39;d like to see new 46- (the been there done that<br/>\nsyndrome) - but in this case - for all practicle you&#39;re still a 46+ - cause<br/>\nyou&#39;ve built a character up.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Now - no one can argue that the servers aren&#39;t overcrowded.  The<br/>\ncrowding problem affects people of ALL levels.  For us 46- this is a<br/>\nproblem.  For the 46+ it&#39;s a problem.  I supposed the only positive might be<br/>\npeople starting new characters in zones like West and East Commons and<br/>\nprobably don&#39;t have to worry about getting attacked by Griffens and Giants<br/>\nlike I did when I started my character; but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the<br/>\nspots they want to hunt are overcrowded as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think it&#39;s kind of silly for people who think &quot;the crowding issue is<br/>\nworse for my level than others&quot;.  It reminds me of stupid arguments between<br/>\nmusicians who claim their intsrument is harder to play.  To play well - they<br/>\nall are hard!<br/>\n<br/>\n    There&#39;s no easy solution to this.  I heard someone propose putting caps<br/>\non the server when 1500+ come on.  I personally would be damn pissed if I<br/>\nwanted to play and couldn&#39;t get in - regardless of how crowded it is.  This<br/>\nis probably not an acceptable solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I hear they are splitting Fennin Ro up.  Good for Fennin - but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help me.  I can see that opening a can of worms.  If they do that to<br/>\nmy server - I&#39;d hate to find out a lot of my good friends end up on another<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\n    But short of adding a whole slew of new zones (ideally the best<br/>\nsolution) which is impracticle to expect; I really don&#39;t see an &quot;ideal&quot;<br/>\nsolution...<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway - despite my own two-cents - this thread probably should be<br/>\nKabong&#39;d (not much else I can do while waiting for a CAB for a large VB<br/>\nproject to be built)...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
