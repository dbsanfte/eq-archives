Not certain if this is has<br/>\nbeen mentioned before or is common knowledge to everyone so I&#39;ll post it<br/>\nhere as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a Mask of Deception and worship Bristlebane, then you can<br/>\nbuy/sell/bank (but not bind) in the evil outpost in the Overthere zone.<br/>\nThose two combined will raise your faction to Apprehensive with the guards<br/>\nand merchants (at least the ones I conned).  Throw in the carillon and you<br/>\ncan raise your faction to Amiable:-)  I tried this today and was able to<br/>\nroam freely through the outpost.  A big bonus to this is that now<br/>\nBristlebane bards can do the sarnak war braid quest.  This is an awesome<br/>\nquest.  I turned in 4 war braids and got a noticeable increase in EXP (at<br/>\n36th level).  Sarnak war braids are frequent drops so I see myself hanging<br/>\nout in the Overthere for a level or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot certain is agnostics with a Mask can bank there.  Also don&#39;t know if<br/>\npeople with bad Venril Sathir (sp?) faction can do this.  If you have done a<br/>\nlot of fighting in Karnor&#39;s Castle then be sure to /con from a distance<br/>\nbefore you go in.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
