Just<br/>\n&gt; remember, there will *always* be something bigger and meaner<br/>\n&gt; than you in this game for you to fight.  While advancing<br/>\n&gt; quickly may inflate your ego (and I don&#39;t mean that in a<br/>\n&gt; derogatory way), it deprives you of time to explore and<br/>\n&gt; experience things meant for people your current level, good<br/>\n&gt; and bad.  Some day, a level 15 player will gaze at your level<br/>\n&gt; 45 awesomeness, and ask you for advice, and you will be unable<br/>\n&gt; to give him any because at his level you had equipment way<br/>\n&gt; beyond his means.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>\n&gt; immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>\n&gt; sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>\n&gt; for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>\n&gt; to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>\n&gt; by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>\n&gt; be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my opinion.  To each his own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H. Kim<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I realize you don&#39;t exactly like twinkers, but there are several<br/>\ninaccuracies I can think of with that argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, having better equipment doesn&#39;t mean you explore *less*. It<br/>\nmeans (for instance) being able to go to High Hold, or the Eastern Karanas,<br/>\na level earlier than you normally could. Nor does it affect knowledge of<br/>\nequipment- at level 13, you&#39;re either wearing leather, banded, or bronze,<br/>\nwith a quest item or two mixed in (again, the quests are made MORE fun<br/>\nbecause, just maybe, you can now solo the mob that&#39;s eluded you for the last<br/>\ntwo levels, not less.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, 250pp is not 250,000. Yes, that will buy you a set of bronze, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean you must immediately stop looking for better stuff until you<br/>\nmake 10 more levels. On the contrary- it means you can save up money for the<br/>\n*truly* useful items, like some elf hide gloves (if you&#39;re not an elf, that<br/>\nis &lt;G&gt;) or a battle drum. It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>\nactually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least a<br/>\nhundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade skills<br/>\nor even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>\nmuch more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, why is having a full set of bronze, a dirk, and money in the bank<br/>\n(i.e., not having to worry about where your next song is coming from- that<br/>\nwas a very real concern to me at that level) somehow less &#39;noble&#39; or &#39;fair&#39;<br/>\nthan wearing all patchwork except for an admittedly very nice crown on your<br/>\nhead? I freely admit the situation would be very different if this was an<br/>\nactive twink- that&#39;s part of why all my characters are independent of each<br/>\nother. But using a fairly gotten reward to make the next few levels less<br/>\npainful- to, perhaps, get to see High Hold or Unrest a few days ahead of<br/>\ntime- isn&#39;t exactly cheating, at least in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlame away...<br/>\n<br/>\nBrudo (E&#39;Ci)<br/>\nAdar (Brell Serillian, Tallon Zek)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
