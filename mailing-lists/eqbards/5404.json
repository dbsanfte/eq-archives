I camped the Ghost all weekend last<br/>\nweek and we killed him every 20 minutes or so for about 15 hrs, with some<br/>\nHag spawns in his place every once in a while. We must have had 30 bands<br/>\nthough and were giving them away to everybody. I didnt really understand<br/>\nthere amazement having never really camped Unrest before. Then I heard<br/>\nsomeone the next day auctioning one for 200pp, ROFL, and it sold for more. I<br/>\nonly kept one ring myself because I was 1st in line for the boots and we<br/>\nnever got them Saturday. Sunday morning though I was working the hallway to<br/>\nthe Ghost and some Druid cut in front of us clearing the way to the ghostand<br/>\npulled the whole room and the pit and ran. I Chained the Ghost out of the<br/>\ntrain and killed him, and got both the boots and a ring, woohoo!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: CYR, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 20, 1999 5:59 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Crested Spaulders/ Jagged Band<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;CYR, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni myself prefer the bloodstained mantle for the magic resist... though the<br/>\nac is abit lower.

I gave him a tell and was<br/>\n&gt; offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked there by<br/>\n&gt; his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we ran down to<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat back across<br/>\n&gt; the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and I was 100pp<br/>\n&gt; richer.<br/>\n&gt; Today, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his<br/>\n&gt; level 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I<br/>\n&gt; arrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of Bronze<br/>\n&gt; Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked him and<br/>\n&gt; he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in the bank<br/>\n&gt; was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and purchased my new<br/>\n&gt; peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old Amber ring, the 2<br/>\n&gt; bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old Rusty Spiked shoulders<br/>\n&gt; to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I met the Cleric again and<br/>\n&gt; he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter at the Caster Guild because<br/>\n&gt; everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him there and once again thanked<br/>\n&gt; him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am wondering   if The Crested<br/>\n&gt; Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, or maybe I can trade it for<br/>\n&gt; things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, a Second Jagged band,<br/>\n&gt; Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am happy with my current<br/>\n&gt; Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon dirk, so I think that<br/>\n&gt; Armor is the way to go.<br/>\n&gt; Any help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Gleeman, bard of the 18th song - Karana<br/>\n&gt; The luckiest Bard in Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\nFor details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
