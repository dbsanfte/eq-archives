No worries on the Lute, It would have been a stretch <br/>\nto get there.  Although, with the 30 minute timer, I may have had <br/>\ntime to log in a twink, buy a stone, log in my friends wizard, pick <br/>\nup the stone and then TP myself up to Hate in time... let me stress <br/>\nMAY have had time, hehe... My other 2 Wizzie friends apologized <br/>\nprofusely but were either killing Goranaire or raiding Skyshrine. <br/>\nLike that&#39;s more important??  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI still wish a BP dropped for me... er, I mean 2 BP&#39;s, one for you <br/>\nand one for me. :)  (inside joke)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. remind me to park a few Hate stones on my friend&#39;s wizzie. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey go to loot him ┬û sadly for the Warrior ┬û no Hand; but he had 2 <br/>\ncount em 2 Seven String Lutes!
