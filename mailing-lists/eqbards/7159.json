That leaves me just 12 slots<br/>\nfor loot, and I&#39;m not going to give them up for the dozen or<br/>\nso different types of foraged food/drink.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe no-drop change will help, as would a 10 slot box of<br/>\naku-bar or whatever. Another possible change (could we add it<br/>\nto the petition?) would be allowing you to open containers in<br/>\nnon-640x480 resolutions from inventory slots on your hotkey<br/>\npad.  Then I could keep all my instruments in a bag, freeing<br/>\nme to carry 4 more containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
