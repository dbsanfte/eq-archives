There are so many things wrong with handling even a *portion* of<br/>\nthe drop/trade code on the client side.  The best &#39;for instance&#39; i can give is<br/>\nthis list...this thread even.  How many of us are developers, or some related<br/>\nfield?  How many of us would have the skill to hack the client to dupe items in<br/>\nthe way that Kit stated would be possible?  &quot;most of us&quot; would appear to be the<br/>\ncorrect response.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChances are that the client does send a mouse_click message to the<br/>\nserver...either the item on the cursor is sent as a parameter or the server<br/>\nqueries for the cursor &quot;container&quot; and whether or not it is populated, and by<br/>\nwhat.  Then, it can determine what action to take (such as trade with obj<br/>\nX/drop to world/&quot;this item cannot be dropped traded or sold.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever there is some evidence that Lyrnia(sp?)/rokenn&#39;s theory may be<br/>\nfeasable.  I was thinking about casting a spell...how is that handled (client<br/>\nserver wise)?  You cannot drop/trade while casting. Nor can you have a trade<br/>\ninitiated while casting.  Does the Client send a server message &quot;Started<br/>\ncasting&quot; and then a &quot;finished casting&quot; message, in which case the Server would<br/>\nhold the flag. Or (in the case of someone trying to trade with the caster) does<br/>\nthe server try to initiate a trade, and the *client* respond &quot;no, i&#39;m busy&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\nthere is a fairly large number of options available for how this was done...but<br/>\ni suspect that if one were to guess &quot;server side&quot; on most of it, they would be<br/>\ncorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is also a possibility that all the programmer-types here have ignored the<br/>\npossibility of a bad implementation...see the current threads on EQ Forums on<br/>\nthe Illusions+Mez in PVP.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that is *more than enough* input from me i think :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid (retired)<br/>\n24th level half-dark-elf bard :)<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss (retired)<br/>\n30th Circle DE Magician<br/>\nPrexus server<br/>\n<br/>\nHiro Protagonist <br/>\n30th level Wood Elf Druid<br/>\n&lt;Tears of Prexus&gt;:Secretary of Transportation :)<br/>\nMorrell-Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
