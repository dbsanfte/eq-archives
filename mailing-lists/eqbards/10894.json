I love the monster slaying part of EQ, mainly the teamwork<br/>\npart, as a good group of well played characters is the most fun I&#39;ve had<br/>\nin the game, but I miss the socializing part of UO a lot too. I probably<br/>\nspent as much time hanging around the bank in Britain chatting with<br/>\nfriends and meeting new ones as I did in the dungeons. Come to think of<br/>\nit, I probably spent more time in town than out in UO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t, however, miss the backstabbing by random strangers part of UO.<br/>\nI hope someday someone creates a game that has the best of both these 2<br/>\ngames in it.
