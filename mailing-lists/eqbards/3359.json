You should be able to sell it<br/>\nlater to a player for a profit, or to a merchant at a 10%-15%<br/>\nloss, so they do not really cost as much as their price<br/>\nindicates.  While the dirk has dropped the bottom out of the<br/>\ncombine rapier market, the combine longsword and scimitar<br/>\nmarkets are still doing well because several classes that can<br/>\nuse those but cannot use the dirk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are L17 or higher and already have a dirk, a combine<br/>\nfor your off hand can be a good choice for the same reason.<br/>\nIf you ever upgrade your off-hand weapon, you can easily<br/>\nliquidate the combine and get 80%-90% of your money back (more<br/>\nif you sell it to a player).  Unless you need the money *now*<br/>\nfor something else, most combines only end up costing 5-10pp<br/>\nto own.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
