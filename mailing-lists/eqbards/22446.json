If you&#39;re curious, below the *** is how I<br/>\nopted to handle the situation.  Oh yeah and the wizard is down to a bubble<br/>\nof mana at this point having just ported us out of Kithicore before the<br/>\nundead got us both...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think I&#39;ll remain seated for a bit ... at least until that latest<br/>\nroot breaks.  Then, I&#39;ll let you gather the stuff and put it in the<br/>\nbag.  I&#39;m not sure I want to be within arms reach of you at the<br/>\nmoment ... I can see the wheels turning in that devious little mind<br/>\nor yours all way from here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go on, remain seated,&quot; the rogue mutters under her breath just as a<br/>\nskeleton appears, hovering in mid air about a dozen feet behind the<br/>\nmeditating caster.  Beyond the hovering pile of bones, Mead&#39;s half-elven<br/>\nvision picks out another skeleton approaching.  She watches and notes the<br/>\npath it follows would keep it a safe distance from the elves.  Mead smiles,<br/>\na plan having been formulated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Aziev studies her book, the rogue slowly, silently gets out her bow.<br/>\nThe wizard had allowed the Immobilize spell to drop once.  That was<br/>\nmistake.  Mead had been mentally counting down to when it would break<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\n15...14...13...<br/>\n<br/>\nMead observes a tiny twitch in the wizard&#39;s pointy ears as she picks out<br/>\nthe sound of the approaching skeleton.  Then watches as the high-elf&#39;s<br/>\nfeatures relax again, having guaged by sound that the skeleton would keep<br/>\nit&#39;s distance.<br/>\n<br/>\n11...10...9...<br/>\n<br/>\nMead slowly raises the bow and takes aim.  She bites her lip in fear that<br/>\nshe might miss and hit Aziev by mistake.  But it is a chance she&#39;ll have to<br/>\ntake.<br/>\n<br/>\n7...6...5...<br/>\n<br/>\nAn arrow whizzes by Azievs head, knocking the spawning skeleton out of the<br/>\nair.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A-ha-ha-ha,&quot; the skeleton cackles as it charges towards the theif.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second skeleton hears the call and comes charging over.  &quot;A-ha-ha-ha,&quot;<br/>\nthe second skeleton cackles as it lays it&#39;s glowing sockets on a medding<br/>\ncaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nMead holds her breath and braces herself for the mad dash she&#39;ll have to<br/>\nmake if this stunt actually works.<br/>\n<br/>\n3...2...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Embedded image moved to file: pic00754.pcx)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
