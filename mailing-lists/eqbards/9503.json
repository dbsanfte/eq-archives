I ask because<br/>\nthe descriptions of this quest on several web pages say it is for Human<br/>\nSteel Warriors only.  But I have never found a quest that couldn&#39;t be<br/>\ndone with suitable faction adjustments (via Carrillion).  Luckily, I am<br/>\na half elf (one of the races allowed to use the bracer according to the<br/>\nitem description).  Also, can you do it without doing the first part of<br/>\nthe quest?  Or is that required as is implied by the quest descriptions?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, Level 29 bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSteven S.
