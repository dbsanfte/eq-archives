I was<br/>\nstanding outside Solusek A, waiting for some of my regulars to log on so I<br/>\ncould go in and claim my fiery vambraces and my firewalker boots.  Well<br/>\nafter a while nobody had showed, but a couple people I was slightly<br/>\naquainted with happened to be standing around and volunteered to help me<br/>\nout.  They in turn called in a level 50 wizard to come along who also needed<br/>\nan item from Solusek A.<br/>\nNow Solusek A is a pretty easy dungeon for me, but the number of goblins in<br/>\nthere is such that I was very hesitant to go in with only a monk, warrior,<br/>\nwizard and me - No healing.  But hey, what the heck, only live once, off we<br/>\nwent.  Sure, we almost died, but the adrenaline rush I got from being within<br/>\na bubble of death a couple of times was pretty exciting.  Pretty sad when<br/>\nyou&#39;re only healer is a bard :)<br/>\nThe Lavawalker Boots dropped from the first mage that we killed.  The<br/>\nvambraces took about 8 or 9 champions before I got one.  That being done,<br/>\nand our wizard having gotten her whatever heart off a wizard we were ready<br/>\nto leave.<br/>\nThe wizard then stated that she was going to Permafrost to get her next<br/>\ncomponent.  Well, knowing I needed something from there too, I came along.<br/>\nLet me tell you, its pretty easy to clear the king area when you train<br/>\neverything to one place and have your wizard unload her 800+ AoE spell.  I<br/>\njust stood back and watched.  Took about 12 elite goblins before I picked up<br/>\nmy icy vambraces.  (These can be worn by the way, AC8, +5 cold and have the<br/>\nsame colorful look as the new lambent armor.  I started wearing them even<br/>\nthough they are worse than my rubi, just because the look so damn cool).<br/>\nOur wizard got what she needed from her second kill.<br/>\nFrom here, I met up with a druid friend of mine and went to the karanas.  We<br/>\nkilled a few hill giants, but no lambent stones.  Decided to go kill Choon<br/>\nand Froon.  Choon dropped his rune the first time, Froon the second.  Other<br/>\nbards have gotten them both on the first drop.  These runes look identical,<br/>\nbut using the 14th level identify song, you can sort out which is the top,<br/>\nand which is the middle.<br/>\nWell, I now had what I needed to make both boots and arms, minus the lambent<br/>\nstones.  We&#39;d been killing any giants we had come across, but no stones so<br/>\nfar so we decided to try Oasis.  Third giant there dropped a stone (this was<br/>\nprobably the tenth or so giant we had killed that night).<br/>\nWhoo hoo!  Had enough to make one piece now.  Hmmm, boots or arms. . . .<br/>\ndecided on arms, my boots (dwarven workboots) already have good plusses, so<br/>\nthey can wait.  Handed in all my components and was rewarded with lambent<br/>\nsleeves.  AC11, +1cha, +2 to all resistances.  Not too shabby, only 1AC less<br/>\nthan my azure sleeves with some plusses to boot, and such a funky color :)<br/>\nHopefully tonight I&#39;ll get some more stones and be able to make more.  As a<br/>\nside note, a bard on our server tried to make the breastplate, but got<br/>\nnothing.  He says the breastplate quest is bugged, but it could just be that<br/>\nhis faction was too low because I *know* he hailed that efreeti who lowers<br/>\nyour faction when you try and talk to him.<br/>\nAll the components you need to collect are LORE and NO DROP, except for the<br/>\nlambent stones which are just LORE.<br/>\nIf people are interested, I&#39;ll post more info as I find it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartsting<br/>\nLevel 47 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
