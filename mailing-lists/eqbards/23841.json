We had 2 <br/>\n&gt; groups together in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Howling Stones North Tower. One group had a L44 chanter, a <br/>\n&gt; 50s shaman, a 50s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;warrior, 50s cleric all played by 2 people plus a 50s wiz. <br/>\n&gt; The chanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really didn&#39;t function as a chanter and we&#39;d asked them not <br/>\n&gt; to bring her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;along as we had a real working chanter in our group. We got <br/>\n&gt; to the last<br/>\n&gt; &gt;corner before the Crypt keeper&#39;s room and when the monk <br/>\n&gt; pulled it, the whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt;room came. We killed the Crypt Keeper but had alot of mobs on us. Our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chanter was doing his best to pause/mez what he could. Then <br/>\n&gt; the hallway<br/>\n&gt; &gt;started to respawn and we had 8 -10 mobs. Our chanter died, <br/>\n&gt; I was doing what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I could but out numbered by live awake mobs. We called for <br/>\n&gt; gates and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other groups wiz got them out. We all died. The necro in our <br/>\n&gt; group looted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the chanter robe (Siren&#39;s?) off the keeper before he died <br/>\n&gt; and I got the key<br/>\n&gt; &gt;before I died rather than have it poof. The aftermath was <br/>\n&gt; they wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lotto the robe between the chanter twink and the chanter who <br/>\n&gt; died doing CC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We felt this would be very wrong yet they didn&#39;t see it. We <br/>\n&gt; felt the twink,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;while there when the robe dropped, was not being played, <br/>\n&gt; else we probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would not have been wiped out. We also all know that char is <br/>\n&gt; a twink, not a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;primary. I think that robe on a twink would hurt our guild&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; credibility<br/>\n&gt; &gt;somewhat as the twink belongs to the head of the guild. It&#39;s also our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;opinion you can&#39;t function as a good chanter unless the <br/>\n&gt; person is giving the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;character their whole attention. I&#39;d like to hear the <br/>\n&gt; opinion of others on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this. Were we out of line?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The result was I said we&#39;d walk on the guild if they <br/>\n&gt; insisted on lottoing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it. They agreed to give the robe to the other chanter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Excalibur, Xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
