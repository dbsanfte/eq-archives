South East corner of SK in<br/>\nhouse inside a wall use AE to pull him.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to HighKeep - basement of the bank.  Start in the Lookout room & Guard<br/>\nroom until you get a feel for this place.  Soon you will be effective in the<br/>\nWarrior room (stronger goblins - higher level players.)  These goblins<br/>\nrequire groups (occasionally a lev 30 shows and wants to solo them) they are<br/>\nmelee fites for the most part.  Anthem or Chant for the tanks. Binding and<br/>\nchains are welcome.  AE songs are ok in there unless someone has trained<br/>\ngobs to the guards and them they chase the gobs back down - rare but it<br/>\nhappens.  Spawn times are far enough apart that you can heal the group<br/>\nbetween although the pallies will no doubt waste mana healing them selves<br/>\nafter battle - I guess they just enjoy medding.
