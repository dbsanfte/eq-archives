The base AC was the main factor when<br/>\nfighting blues. The rate at which I got critical hit<br/>\nseemed to be the same regardless of armor type. However, when<br/>\nfighting yellows or reds, going from cloth/netted to leather<br/>\nor leather to LJ tunic made a big difference in how often I got<br/>\ncriticaled. Second, the difference did not become large until<br/>\naround level 20. But by 20, the difference between a LJ tunic<br/>\nand a leather tunic was significant regardless of buffs when<br/>\nfighting yellows or reds (and later whites). So the test<br/>\nresults may be both level specific and dependent on the relative<br/>\nlevel of the mob. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother consideration is that Verant has stated that armor has<br/>\nan antitwinking element to it such that you dont get the full<br/>\nbenefit of it till you reach a certain level. Therefore, the person<br/>\ntesting this theory would need to be at least 30 to be certain<br/>\nthat they are getting the full benefit of plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lora Roa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 06, 1999 8:15 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Strength vs Agility<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was the Rogues list this came up on before ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone did tests through naked, PW/leather, Banded/Bronze.  They used<br/>\nbuffs to raise the AC in a lower armor to match thier unbuffed AC in a<br/>\nhigher armor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;d have person with AC X in leather with buffs, and then same<br/>\nperson with same AC X in bronze but unbuffed.  This was done with different<br/>\nAC X&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results posted of the most well designed tests indicated that the<br/>\nprotection factors are rolled into the AC.  The damage and damage pattern<br/>\nwas the same at AC X, regardless of what armor/spells got you to AC X.<br/>\nThis was true for more than one AC X.  Would anyone on this list care to<br/>\nreplicate the tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lora<br/>\nStarling Erollisi<br/>\nMelodie Brell  <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShow your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\nWith a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
