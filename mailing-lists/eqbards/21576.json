I didn&#39;t get a chance to play my bard last night, but did do this <br/>\nfor my cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat &quot;screen shiver&quot; was pretty wild, but it does seem that another press <br/>\nof the hot key does start the whole sequence over again. However, for pulls <br/>\nand healing I love the %t command. Nothing was sweeter than our puller <br/>\nsaying &quot;/g inc %t&quot;, and having our enchanter say &quot;/g Mezzing %t&quot; and me <br/>\nsaying &quot;/g Healing %t&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI convinced my enchanter friend that these are very handy and he loves <br/>\nthem. The &quot;pause&quot; command didn&#39;t really work well for me with a caster, but <br/>\nI&#39;m sure that just needs to be refined.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:44 AM 9/29/00 -0400, Moss wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Whooop !!! I spent several hours last night making macros from socials<br/>\n&gt;and testing them. Ortez [sp?], the green orc in S Ro that heals himself<br/>\n&gt;makes and excellent test subject BTW. Here is what I found with examples<br/>\n&gt;listed below.<br/>\n&gt;   1. The shortest delay with my equipment and my DSL connection I could<br/>\n&gt;get was for all practical purposes      was 30.<br/>\n&gt;      I might get as low as 28, but start &quot;losing&quot; songs out of the<br/>\n&gt;rotation when they don&#39;t have time to get<br/>\n&gt;      up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   2. The &quot;/stopsong&quot; command is essential and takes up an entire line by<br/>\n&gt;itself. This has a limiting effect on how many songs your can<br/>\n&gt;practically use. TWO. You CAN make a macro to sing 3 songs but the last<br/>\n&gt;song will stay on and you will have to stop it manually. ....Well, there<br/>\n&gt;is a way around it but if you don&#39;t have excellent timing you either get<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;Chat screen shivers&quot; , when it shakes telling you you have<br/>\n&gt;conflicting commands trying to be processed or the first song seems to<br/>\n&gt;drop out of the rotation. My attempt at a single 3 song macro looks like<br/>\n&gt;this. Resist messages did not stop the macro for continuing. Missed<br/>\n&gt;notes MAY HAVE messed up the timing though... I do know that if I missed<br/>\n&gt;a note the macro continued but the timing seemed thrown off enough that<br/>\n&gt;the following song had trouble coming up. Not sure about this yet but<br/>\n&gt;the solution was easy. Wait and hit the macro again to resynch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  3SNG (Macro name, 3 song)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong (to stop the last macro or song that is presumable still going<br/>\n&gt;on)<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/cast 4 (Chant of Flame) Note.. no pause line needed.. it just plays on<br/>\n&gt;anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  3. Suddenly last night I was able to twist FOUR songs 80 percent of the<br/>\n&gt;time ! Never been able to do that with my machine before ! I think this<br/>\n&gt;is because Macros remove any Keying errors and inefficiencies in timing<br/>\n&gt;from my twisting :) The trick here was to set up 2 macros of 2 songs<br/>\n&gt;each.... Run Song and 3 Chants. Run song might flicker but often the<br/>\n&gt;icon would just stay up. I tried putting in a line like /say Hit it<br/>\n&gt;again Sam ! as a visual indicator a macro was done but found that it<br/>\n&gt;just took time away and you knew from the Icon greying/light when a<br/>\n&gt;macro was finished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BTL 1 (Label for &quot;Battle song 1 macro)<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 8 (run song)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils chant)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BTL 2 (name of second macro)<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 5 (Chant of Fire)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  4. They most popular use of the new macro will be the Run/Levitation<br/>\n&gt;combination. You CAN keep the Tracking screen UP !!! using a macro<br/>\n&gt;similar to the one below. Note, Lev FIRST (just in case) and the line to<br/>\n&gt;give yourself a visual signal in the chat window the macro is done. I<br/>\n&gt;found I had at lest 12 seconds grace before having to refresh the macro<br/>\n&gt;if I got distracted. (Why do I feel that unless I want invisibility, I<br/>\n&gt;am not going to be using the level 51 Selo&#39;s Song of Travel much ?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FlyMe (Macro name)<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 6 (Levitation. Put first because I don&#39;t want my teeth<br/>\n&gt;jarred :)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 8 (Run song)<br/>\n&gt;/stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/say Fly Me ! (Chat Screen visual cue for when tracking screen covers<br/>\n&gt;your song icons)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  5. I also made Macros combining Heal Song, Mana Song and Niv&#39;s so I can<br/>\n&gt;keep Mana up while healing the party which reduces keystrokes.<br/>\n&gt;  6. I found that &quot;/pause 30&quot; on a line by itself MAY be required if your<br/>\n&gt;mixing Cast and Say type commands in some situations. The &quot;/pause 30&quot;<br/>\n&gt;line ALWAYS has to be the first statement of a line even though it is<br/>\n&gt;executed after the second statement. Whenever I tried to make a line<br/>\n&gt;with more than 2 statements in it I got garbage. This should be further<br/>\n&gt;investigated to be sure. Might just be me :)<br/>\n&gt;  7. Finally, if you want to switch songs between battles, say to drop<br/>\n&gt;out a chant for a Heat shield, a simple right click on the icon brings<br/>\n&gt;up the macro and you only have to retype one line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I am sure more sophisticated programmers out there can come up with<br/>\n&gt;better Macros :) but I hope this will help you get started. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
