Yeah I still owe you something for that, hmmm.  I gave<br/>\n  my last one away =(  But I&#39;ll get one from Sog or drag myself<br/>\n  into the throne room for another.  Can you send me a list of<br/>\n  some other things you were looking for privately?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d sure like to try that axe and see if it&#39;s better than my St-o-Wr.

But that said, the proc aint bad at all.<br/>\n  I use one for practice only, now that I&#39;m 200 1hb I really don&#39;t<br/>\n  need to practice with it anymore, since 1hb is not the most<br/>\n  powerful weapon class we can use for the time being.  But for the<br/>\n  final decision, I dunno - axe for looks?  staff for slight dmg<br/>\n  increase, pending the proc goes off enough?  Maybe axe for casters <br/>\n  to interrupt them more? I dunno.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There&#39;s a Tier&#39;Dal Rapier thing that bards can wield but mine is rotting in<br/>\n&gt; the bank. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  My tainted teir&#39;dal rapier (5/19, dex2 agi5 dis-5) is collecting dust<br/>\n  too. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
