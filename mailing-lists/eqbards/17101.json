He was attacked 54% of<br/>\n&gt; the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bit misleading.  Your melee could be 95% that of the<br/>\nranger (and the SK&#39;s 101%) and you could get the same results.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d be better off turning on all attack messages, then<br/>\nparsing the file afterwards to figure out damage/sec and<br/>\ndamage_taken/sec figures.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
