I&#39;m always<br/>\n&gt; looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp<br/>\n&gt; to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a<br/>\n&gt; group&quot; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in<br/>\n&gt; the area.
