It&#39;s pretty aggravating if after you&#39;ve done this<br/>\nand are resting, someone just waltzes in to take the named or<br/>\nprize mob - something he couldn&#39;t have done if you hadn&#39;t done<br/>\nthe clearing before him.  It&#39;s likely the gnolls they killed<br/>\ntwo rooms away fled there and they had to chase them.

Usually<br/>\nthe high levels are after the named shamen and commanders,<br/>\nleaving plenty of nobles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good place if you&#39;re good about keeping an eye out for<br/>\ngriffons and hill giants in West Comonlands.  The young<br/>\nkodiaks and kodiaks there give pretty good experience, the<br/>\noccasional wandering wisps will give good loot, and if you<br/>\never get in trouble there&#39;s lots of open space to flee/kite/<br/>\nheal/zone.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever died in West Commonlands,<br/>\nand the griffons and giants do a good job of keeping the riff<br/>\nraff out.  There are dervish and orc camps there too, but they<br/>\nare tough to crack without a group (7-9 mobs usually).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
