What levels is it good for exactly? Like mid 30s?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I went there at 30 and I&#39;m within a bubble of hitting 35 tonight.  I&#39;m a<br/>\ncasual player (couple of hours a night at most) and have been there for<br/>\nabout 3 weeks now. Like you, I had been in Frontier Mountains doing the<br/>\ngiants, but it was quickly becoming FarmQuest, with everyone after Loops.<br/>\nDalnir (on my server at least) has less than 20 people in the zone at peak<br/>\ntimes - you&#39;ll find mostly casters and monks there.  Casters because of<br/>\ntheir self-bind and monks because there&#39;s some nice loot for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first floor is good for high 20&#39;s (at a push) to 33 or so.  I&#39;d stay<br/>\nthere for now until you find a regular group you&#39;re comfortable with... that<br/>\nfirst trip down to the 2nd level can be a bit daunting.  On the first floor<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find Ravenous Nibblers (pure melee), Gyrating Goo (melee but have a<br/>\nstrong poison DoT) and various Coerced beasties such as Gnomes, Goblins,<br/>\nIksar, Erudite, Tier&#39;Dal and Dwarves.  Most of them are casters, so have<br/>\nRhythms handy or get interrupting them with Pixie Strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second floor is an absolute joy from 32-37.  I&#39;m 34 and everything still<br/>\ncons blue.  I&#39;ve been grouping with a 38 necro and most of the Kly (Sarnaks)<br/>\nwere still blue to her.  There&#39;s some excellent loot to be had there too,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m all about the exp right now. :)  Notable beasties are the Imprecator<br/>\nhimself (he drops one of the Ancient Coins for the Tambourine quest), and<br/>\nLumpy Goo (who drop Graven Sandals and Fighting Batons).  The Imprecator<br/>\nroom is an absolute blast once you break that spawn cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to note about Dalnir is the non-aggro mobs.  Some of the Nibblers<br/>\nand Goo will happily let you stroll past.  It helps to learn which ones and<br/>\nwhere are non-aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend getting a good map of the place - try Allakhazam&#39;s for some<br/>\nlinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
