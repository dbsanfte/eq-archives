Thats not where<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m getting at all.  My annoyance comes from every time Verant feels<br/>\n&gt; compelled to keep the dragons challenging for the current crop of lvl<br/>\n&gt; 50&#39;s.  They are not considering the people who aren&#39;t there yet...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I know, Matt.  I had to throw it in though, because as of recently<br/>\n  a lot of high level players are giving the majority of good players<br/>\n  in that level range a bad rap.  That wasn&#39;t geared to you, just as<br/>\n  a general comment to the L1-L40 populace.  I&#39;m one of the friendliest<br/>\n  L50s on our server when it comes to helping people out.  And people<br/>\n  are surprised, which concerns me.  I would like to dispel this elite<br/>\n  visage that people give L50 players.  It simply does not hold true<br/>\n  for me.  And it applies to our conversation in that when you make<br/>\n  L50 the dragons (all 10 of them, doh /tease, sorry) will still be an<br/>\n  option to you, I guarentee it.  I&#39;m me first, badass L50 second ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ryan/Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
