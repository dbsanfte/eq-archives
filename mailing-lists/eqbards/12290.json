Yesterday I got four straight missed notes when trying to start up<br/>\nselos.  I had just logged into the game, wasn&#39;t in combat, and had no lag<br/>\nproblems.  If there is a base chance of 5% for missing a note, the chances<br/>\nof me failing to start selos on four straight attempts was 0.00000625 (5% x<br/>\n5% x 5% x 5%).  I think the random number generator was definately not<br/>\nacting very random on this occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On a second but maybe related note, I believe the random number genrator<br/>\n&gt; may be flawed in the game.  I see too many long runs of unlikly events<br/>\n&gt; (both good and bad).  This would be far from unheard of, as random<br/>\n&gt; number generators are eseentially impossible to code.  (People just<br/>\n&gt; write code that approximates random number generartion).  I did a study<br/>\n&gt; of the random number generator built into the 8088 (basically the<br/>\n&gt; original IBM PC) processor.  (I used a few different languages to try to<br/>\n&gt; eliminate any effect they had on it).  I basically graphed a &quot;random&quot; x<br/>\n&gt; and y cooordinate, drawing a line from point 1 to 2 to 3, etc...  The<br/>\n&gt; plots always followed similar patterns... Weird, eh?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
