At least it doesn&#39;t cost me any mana<br/>\nto reapply them.  Also, once you get a feel for how long it<br/>\ntakes your group to kill a mob, you can stop your Chants and<br/>\nwade in with your weapons for a little extra damage.  For the<br/>\nfolks I&#39;m usually with, that happens on the second application<br/>\nof the Chants in Fear, and when the mobs are at half hp in<br/>\nHate.  From that point on, the Chants I&#39;ve put on will last<br/>\nmost of the remainder of the fight, so I go ahead and switch<br/>\nto weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mode, and on everything else I twisted the Chants.  I noticed that on mobs<br/>\n&gt; that I was able to stick the Chants on consistently, we always got the<br/>\n&gt; experience (2 tanks, cleric, druid, bard, and non-nuking enchanter) -- I<br/>\n&gt; stopped taking counts after we got the first 4 of 5.

Every time one of those has died to a DoT<br/>\nfor us, the corpse has poofed.  I usually try applying two<br/>\nChants at the beginning of a fight with TTs, then switch to<br/>\nmelee.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
