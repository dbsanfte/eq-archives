These items are<br/>\ndeity items linked to Tunare.  My bard is a wood elf but I chose Bristlebane<br/>\nsince I figured the god of rogues was more fitting for a bard than Tunare.<br/>\nSo does that mean I can not equip these weapons since I don&#39;t worship<br/>\nTunare?  And if I can&#39;t equip weapons crafted by wood elves, could I equip<br/>\ndeity weapons crafted by halflings who worship Bristlebane?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
