I believe it&#39;s not too far distant from the buying<br/>\nprice.  I suppose someone may unload at a lesser cost because they are<br/>\nencumbered heavily, at the source of the new armor, but I figured it was a<br/>\nlong shot at best and decided to just wait until I could buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the breatplate for low 800&#39;s.   That&#39;s with Cha 113 and<br/>\nCharismatic Charillion to Amiable.  Faction seems to play a MUCH higher role<br/>\nthan Cha...
