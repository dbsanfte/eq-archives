Ok easy, so far.<br/>\nWHEN do you start the second?<br/>\nDo you start the second immediately when the icon for that song comes up? Do<br/>\nyou start it immediately when you see the expected text in the textbox? (If<br/>\nit sounds stupid, I&#39;ve actually seen so many times where the icon does NOT<br/>\ngo up at the same time as the words appear in the text box). Or do you click<br/>\na song, don&#39;t wait for anything and click the next song right away? Do you<br/>\nstart the first song, and wait to start the second until the graphics for<br/>\nthe first song take effect? (i.e. the little blue sprinkles for Hymn, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWho knows, maybe I have been doing it wrong all this time (smile)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Whoever mentioned &quot;Mixing&quot;, I like that! It fits perfectly into &quot;music&quot;<br/>\nterminology, and is short and easy, and doesn&#39;t sound as silly as<br/>\n&quot;twisting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTim</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
