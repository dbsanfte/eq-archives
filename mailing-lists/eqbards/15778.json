Song combat<br/>\nmeans you save money on expensive weapons (unless they are gifts).  This<br/>\nmoney can go towards better armor and your songs (instruments are cheap :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not certain that four song weaving is beneficial over three.  I tried<br/>\nthrowing in either bellow and/or chains with some twists.  Unless you can<br/>\nminimize the time with just 3 song coverage (to one second or less), you<br/>\nare probably losing more in terms of efficiency than you are gaining with<br/>\nextra damage or slow down effect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you zone into EK from Highpass, and go all the way down to the end of<br/>\nthe ramp, take a left, pass the named gnolls (carefully), there is a big<br/>\nhill made of<br/>\nrock which is crawling with rock spiders.  Usually, these are plentiful<br/>\nand non camped.  Locate one, insult it with bellow, and lure it to an<br/>\nisolated area (the zone edge nearest this mountain among the trees is<br/>\ngood).  Then twist away.  In general, stick to the spiders who /con low<br/>\nblue rather than high...it makes a big difference.  If you get poisoned<br/>\nearly, take the spider to the barbarian guards in the village, and don&#39;t<br/>\nhesitate.  Make sure not to sing AE&#39;s around them :o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tended to run later rather than earlier, and it was a while before I<br/>\nlearned the benefit of picking low blues...so I took some lumps.  If you<br/>\ncan find a single partner to hunt with (somebody who can cure poison,<br/>\npreferrably), you&#39;ll do really well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSinistral of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 6 Mar 2000, Talies the Wanderer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, so I&#39;ve got some good suggestions for where - now how about some <br/>\n&gt; HOWs?
