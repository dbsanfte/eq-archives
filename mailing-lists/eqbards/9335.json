I looted it, thanked the <br/>\nOgre that had supplied the kill, and sped off on my merry way.  Later, <br/>\nhowever, I took a closer look at it.  It looks just like a Griffene charm, <br/>\nis bard-only, +3 CHA.  But it&#39;s a Grinnene Charm, not a Griffene Charm!  Is <br/>\nthis a typo, something to trick the inattentive bard out of our hard-earned <br/>\nmoney, or just something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone seen this before?  I don&#39;t blame the Ogre for false advertising.. <br/>\nFirst of all, he&#39;s an Ogre... heheeh, and secondly I didn&#39;t have to pay <br/>\nanything for it...  But I&#39;d sure like to know if I&#39;m wasting precious bank <br/>\nstorage for just a piece of cheap jewelry... lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn<br/>\nBard of the 19th Song<br/>\nE&#39;Ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
