I agree","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-502225883\">This is the whole patch and some general discussion from Alan and Brad.  I<br/>\nlike the idea of more xp bonus for grouping and certain underused dungeons.<br/>\nI agree we will see how exactly &quot;Working as intended&quot; is defined this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnip from Alan:<br/>\nWe&#39;ve got a lot of changes planned for the next patch. Changes for hybrids,<br/>\na change to the way that movement spells work (specifically Root), and a bug<br/>\nfix for Lure spells (among many other things). First and foremost I want to<br/>\nexplain the fix to Lures. Right now (before the patch), creatures that<br/>\nshould not get a save versus Lure spells are getting saves based on their<br/>\nlevels. This has been broken for a while. We fixed it on test before<br/>\nChristmas, but this is the first patch since then, and the fix should go<br/>\nlive with the patch. Basically, Lures will become less resisted after the<br/>\npatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe changes to hybrid disciplines and powers are as follows. Hopefully these<br/>\nwill be the last.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Resistant Discipline will last five minutes instead of one minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Holyforge Discipline will lasts five minutes instead of two minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Sanctification Discipline will last fifteen seconds instead of ten<br/>\nseconds<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Lay on Hands will have increased healing for each level after forty of<br/>\nthe paladin. After forty it will do approximately twenty points per level<br/>\nmore (for levels 41-60).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Normal Harm Touches will save as all or nothing. There will be no partial<br/>\nresists.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Harm Touch will increase ten points per level for levels one through<br/>\nforty. From levels forty-one to sixty it will increase thirty points per<br/>\nlevel instead of twenty<br/>\n<br/>\n7) The Harm Touch discipline will increase Harm Touch damage by fifty<br/>\npercent instead of twenty-five percent<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Weaponshield discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Leechcurse discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Deftdance will have its duration increased from ten to fifteen seconds<br/>\n11) Puretone will have duration increased from two to four minutes<br/>\n<br/>\n12) Hybrids will no longer reset weapon timers after casting a spell<br/>\n(further explanation below)<br/>\n<br/>\n13) Trueshot discipline damage calculations will be changed (further<br/>\nexplanation below)<br/>\nWe will also be giving Hybrids a new spell at level fifty.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the further explanation:<br/>\n<br/>\nTrueshot damage was messed up. Basically it was giving low damage bows too<br/>\nmuch damage and high damage bows too little damage. We are making the damage<br/>\nmore in line with the base damage of the bow. This will reduce the damage of<br/>\nthe discipline for some and increase it for others, depending on the type of<br/>\nbow you were using.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the timer/casting thing... As it is now, casting a spell while using<br/>\na<br/>\nweapon will cause your weapon swings to be delayed by the casting time of<br/>\nthe spell. So, making up numbers here, lets assume you would swing your<br/>\nweapon every ten seconds. If you were to cast a five second casting time<br/>\nspell directly after a weapon swing, then your next swing would occur<br/>\nfifteen seconds after the last one (adding the five seconds for the spell).<br/>\nFor hybrids, this will no longer happen. So if your weapon takes ten seconds<br/>\nto swing, spell casting will no longer increase that swing time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMovement Rate Changes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works.<br/>\nEssentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means<br/>\nthat Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That&#39;s the<br/>\nprimary change. But there is also a side effect to this change.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that<br/>\nenhance movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are aware that this will be seen as a &#39;nerf&#39;. However, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>\nthat most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break<br/>\nroot, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan<br/>\n<br/>\nend snip<br/>\nand snip from Brad:<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\nWell, we&#39;ve been giving all of this (the downtime issue) a lot of thought<br/>\n(as have you all). I&#39;ve been thinking about the issues in two separate<br/>\ncontexts: 1. What could be done with EQ to make it better in this area? and<br/>\n2. What could be done in the future to make MMOGs but probably not to EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, focusing on #1 for the time being, here are a few things we might try<br/>\nshort term:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The post that probably disturbed me most (actually, I didn&#39;t respond to<br/>\nit because I wanted to give it more thought) was the one that claimed many<br/>\nclasses could advance more efficiently soloing than in a group, but that<br/>\nsoloing inherently involves more boring downtime, so therefore we encourage<br/>\nboring downtime for those who want to play efficiently with that subset of<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, EQ has always been a game focused on grouping, with a subset of classes<br/>\nthat could solo if the player chose, but soloing was supposed to be slower<br/>\nand probably less exciting. No, we don&#39;t &#39;hate&#39; the solo player or some<br/>\nsuch, but we think it might be impossible to make a great grouping and great<br/>\nsoloing game (oh no, I probably just started a new gigantic thread with that<br/>\none -- if so, please start it somewhere else so we don&#39;t get too confused,<br/>\nthanks). So, we designed most of the game in terms of balance and content<br/>\naround grouping. But, if we&#39;ve erred and some classes can solo and gain<br/>\nexperience more quickly than were they to group and these players feel<br/>\ntherefore compelled to solo when they might be happier grouping, then we&#39;ve<br/>\ngoofed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this end, we are seriously considering significantly increasing the<br/>\ngrouping experience bonus, where the more people in your group, the bigger<br/>\nthe exp. bonus you get.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Risk vs. reward, especially in dungeons. One of the very easy ways we<br/>\ncould &#39;revamp&#39; underused zones would be to increase the experience you get<br/>\nacross the board in that zone (in case some of you didn&#39;t know, there&#39;s<br/>\nsimply an experience modifier field in each zone header). What does this<br/>\nhave to do with downtime? Well, it indirectly helps out, because one would<br/>\nadvance more quickly in these dungeons, and one could also recover<br/>\nexperience loss due to death more quickly in these zones. For example, would<br/>\nlow to mid level players head to Najena were that zone to give out<br/>\nsignificantly more exp.? (Yes, that&#39;s a question to all of you)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Lastly, we may consider more teleport spots, perhaps with soul bound<br/>\nkeys. Maybe. My inclination is no, but we&#39;re going to seriously debate it<br/>\ntoday.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and on a semi-related note, many of you have concerns over our<br/>\nannouncement of our plans to revamp old world zones using techniques similar<br/>\nto Kunark and Velious. Though Absor alluded to this, I wanted to be very<br/>\nclear: this does not mean necessarily increasing the difficulty. Our attempt<br/>\nin general will be to keep the style and difficulty levels of the old world<br/>\nzones pretty much the same. We realize that old world zones, Kunark zones,<br/>\nand Velious zones are different also in difficulty and types of groups<br/>\nrequired to adventure in them. I think this is a good thing -- players with<br/>\ndifferent play styles, time available, etc. can focus on different areas of<br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we want to do with many of the old world zones is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nAdjust the experience gained (as mentioned above).<br/>\nRandomize existing loot (to hopefully help camping issues)<br/>\nCompletely re-do pathing from scratch on some of the bad ones (Mistmoore<br/>\ncomes to mind). We know more about pathing now, and MAYBE we can make some<br/>\nof these tricky dungeons better -- but no promises (we can&#39;t change the<br/>\ngeometry, after all).<br/>\nAdd some cool quests.<br/>\nAnyway, these are our thoughts going forward, but nothing is set in stone<br/>\nyet, so we&#39;d love your feedback as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Brad<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd 2nd snip<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting huh?  I got these through an email from a friend so I am not<br/>\nsure where they came from.
