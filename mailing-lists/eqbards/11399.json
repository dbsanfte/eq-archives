I was wondering if it is the rare or the common drop and<br/>\nabout how much it sells for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast evening I was on my way out of North Freeport and just as I was about<br/>\nto zone I caught someone auctioning one for 400pp, so I went and grabbed it.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is a good price but I didn&#39;t care much because I was<br/>\nable to turn around and sell my medium steel helm for 333pp so I pretty much<br/>\nbroke even on the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you think this helm compares as a choice at my level (35) with other<br/>\nsimilar headgear like the Crested Helm, the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>\nthe Lambent Helm? I really can&#39;t get enough magic resistance and the +35 hit<br/>\npoints is nice when combined with my lambent BP giving me an overall bonus<br/>\nof 60 hit points, which laughably is like a &quot;free hit&quot; from most of the<br/>\nstuff I am fighting now.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments, suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
