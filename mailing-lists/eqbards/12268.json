For some of their<br/>\ncomponents, they need things that spawn in the world.  However, it takes<br/>\nthem hours to appear, and if one person picks it up, another cleric has<br/>\nlots their shot (so to speak).  I feel damn sorry that they have to camp<br/>\nBilge for their breastplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI very much doubt they will make our quest armor any more difficult to<br/>\nobtain.  I see it (the armor) as, not only our midlife wardrobe, but also<br/>\nour identifier.  If you see someone wearing purple, you know they&#39;re a<br/>\ncleric.  Colorful robes are magicians.  Warriors are garbed in pale blue.<br/>\nRogues can be most often found in black.  And what was that deep blue<br/>\nstreak that just flew past?<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
