Being an old AD&D type, I <br/>\nlooked to that as a model. AC was used as a modifier to the &quot;chance of <br/>\nhitting roll&quot; not a damage modifier.The way the DM rationalized it to me <br/>\nwas thus &quot; When 2 beings are 2 feet away from each other, slashing or <br/>\npoking at each other with sharp, pointy things, it is likely that each <br/>\nattempt will hit. The roll we make to check for a &quot;damaging&quot; hit is to see <br/>\nif you were struck in an unprotected area which would cause damage. If the <br/>\nroll fails, it is assumed that the blow struck you in an area that was <br/>\nsufficiently armoured to prevent damage.&quot; Hence, as your AC increased, the <br/>\nchance of a damaging blow being landed dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Of course, this may have absolutely no bearing on how it works on <br/>\nEQ, but it was a good excuse to harken back to my youth. I thank you for <br/>\nyour consideration and bid you farewell.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwen - Bard - The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
