Can anyone fill me in<br/>\nplease?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, on crowd control, how do you fellow bards handle groups of 4+<br/>\nmobs? I can easily handle mobs #2 and #3 with charm, but if no one is<br/>\nsmart enough to root #4 the group is in trouble. Mezz isn&#39;t reliable,<br/>\nespecially while trying to control a pet, and there&#39;s usually no room<br/>\nindoors to kite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
