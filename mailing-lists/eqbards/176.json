I noticed that the effect of Chant went up as my<br/>\n&gt; singing improved, and again as my skill with a drum increased (only<br/>\n&gt; small improvements, mind you).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One other thing I have noticed.  The time it takes to scribe a song in<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spellbook increases based on the level of the song.  For me (6th level),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memorizing Chant of Battle only takes a few seconds but memorizing Hymn<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Restoration takes about a minute.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is true.  Being of the 10th level, I am able to memorise Chant<br/>\n&gt; in seconds but Anthem takes me about a minute.  Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; used to take as long as Anthem does now, but it is closer to Chant<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This can be a pain in the butt since,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everytime you get killed, you have to rescribe your spells.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t you mean re-memorise?  Your songs/spells stay permanently<br/>\n&gt; scribed into your song/spell book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assume, and hope, that as your singing ability increases the time it<br/>\n&gt; takes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to scribe songs in your spellbook proportionately decreases.  Can anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provide a definitive answer?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I have never had to re-scribe a song, I cannot provide help.  It<br/>\n&gt; does seem to be constant, but I have purchased my songs as soon as<br/>\n&gt; they were available, so if scribing was related to level, I likely<br/>\n&gt; would not notice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my<br/>\n&gt; disappointment<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I did not purchase the Warsong, as I do little soloing.<br/>\n&gt; Do not underestimate the effects of a couple of extra STR and AC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And RE: Anthem versus Chant<br/>\n&gt; Anthem is a singing song, giving maximum benefit while swinging your<br/>\n&gt; mintaur axe.  To get the most from Chant you need to equip your drum<br/>\n&gt; and punch the opposition.  In a party of tanks this may not matter,<br/>\n&gt; but as a person who prefers small groups (2-3), the extra hits from<br/>\n&gt; my axe help lots.<br/>\n&gt; Hence Anthem is worthwhile even when alone.<br/>\n&gt; Also, +10 STR is great (at level 10 singing ability).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could someone please let me know what Warsong gives you (exactly) and<br/>\n&gt; what instrument it uses?  Please include your level and skill in sing/<br/>\n&gt; instrument (if any) if possible.  I am curious as to whether it is <br/>\n&gt; worth the boat ride to purchase this song for the small amount of<br/>\n&gt; soloing I do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mully<br/>\n&gt; Half-elf bard from the realm of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; Currently residing in Freeport<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\n&gt; Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\n&gt; Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n&gt;           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
