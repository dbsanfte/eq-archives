Velk has *a lot* of hp&#39;s.  Our fights with him<br/>\ngo for 15+ minutes. We log hits as best we can.  He does more damage to us<br/>\nthan we do to him but we have better healers!  Also, we res folks in battle<br/>\n- sometimes 2 or 3 times.  In a long fight, you will need to do alot of<br/>\ndamage to him. 500k seems high iirc - more like 200k but if you fight him<br/>\nfor 40 minutes... he is gonna regen a lot more hps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 05, 2001 3:34 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Changes on Test for all Classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that Velketor the Sorcerer has 500k,  ick<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
