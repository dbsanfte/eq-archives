We&#39;ve been talking to the live team and dev team,<br/>\ncurrently only a few pieces of Singing armor sets are ready and they do not<br/>\nhave any stats / effect included in the data file YET.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon these new armors will have stats bonus like imbured / lambent (but<br/>\nbetter), and some pieces will even have process like JBoots. These new armor<br/>\nlooks apple green, not exactly as good looking as imbured IHMO but it&#39;s<br/>\nstill a charming color nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the new weapons, many of you should already noticed these weapons<br/>\nhave better damage / delay ratio than our planer weapons, and it is indeed<br/>\nVerant&#39;s intention to replace planer gear with Kunark gears.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night 3 groups of us spend over 4 hours hunting in Kunor&#39;s Castle, the<br/>\nitem drop rate is very nice, the mobs are not too hard (more like planer<br/>\nlevel mobs) but they come very often and usually comes in group of 4 to 5.<br/>\nWith 3 enchanters we did ok and got some very good loots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the new strategy of Verant to try fixing camping problem is this,<br/>\nfast mob respawn and with good item drop, so everyone will get their chance<br/>\nat items without camping sites for months. This is a very good start and I<br/>\nreally hope this would breath some new air into EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here you go, I hope this info would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 27, 2000 2:33 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Kunark: first impressions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; not that they aren&#39;t very nice, but the new singing steel <br/>\n&gt; bard armor so far<br/>\n&gt; has been AC only with no stats.  the boots are only AC 18, <br/>\n&gt; and gauntlets<br/>\n&gt; were found that are only AC 14, with no stats.  i&#39;m in the <br/>\n&gt; mood for some new<br/>\n&gt; unique weapons, but i will probably keep in my full set of <br/>\n&gt; imbrued cause<br/>\n&gt; looks always come first over stats! =)  plus with the exp <br/>\n&gt; being so slow,<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;ve got enough to worry about than getting another ste of armor, ugh!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L51 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The one that I&#39;m REALLY trying to get right now is a good <br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend (another bard) got a pair of AC18 bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only boots plus some stats that are the same color as the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hero bracer out of Kunar Castle :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; RIVER BELLE CASINO - $25 FREE! <br/>\n&gt; Download the FREE Software, <br/>\n&gt; Open a Real Account and WIN!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/956871117/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2968/7/_/451022/_/956871117/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
