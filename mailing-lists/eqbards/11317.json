Here s what I ve found thus far: After killing a bunch of DE","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-368799299\">I&#39;ve had a guise for a couple of levels now (I&#39;m 37th) and have been fairly<br/>\ncareful with it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found thus far:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter killing a bunch of DE guards in Nektulos Forest (I&#39;d reckon around<br/>\n30-50) I&#39;m completely KOS in the Forrest and in Neriak itself with the Guise<br/>\non.  I kinda wish I handn&#39;t killed the DE guards, because it would be<br/>\nconvenient to be able to use Neriak, but hey...  The DE guards have &quot;KILL<br/>\nME&quot; signs taped on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can use the vendors and Hail the guards in EC with the Guise up, although<br/>\nmy faction goes from &quot;kindly&quot; to &quot;apprehensive&quot;.  I suspect that a complete<br/>\nnewbie who is indifferent to them would, in DE illusion, go from<br/>\n&quot;indifferent&quot; to &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never killed any Troll or Ogre guards in my career and I can now<br/>\nsafely shop and bank in both Oggok and Grobb.  The vendors there are<br/>\n&quot;apprehesive&quot; or perhaps &quot;dubious&quot; to me.  It seems like I *have*<br/>\ncontributed a couple of hits (and thereby received the faction adjustments)<br/>\nto a couple of Ogre Guards, but not more than two for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reluctant to fire the Guise up in Freeport or Qeynos, but I<br/>\n*think* I&#39;d be ok with most folks.  I&#39;m concerned because the Guise seems to<br/>\ndrop your faction 2 notches that if I stumbled across a vendor or guild<br/>\nleader that was only &quot;dubious&quot; when I was level 1 that I had since raised to<br/>\n&quot;indifferent&quot; that he would drop back to &quot;scowling&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, using the Guise is taking a bit of cautious experimentation, but I<br/>\n*can* use Grobb and Oggok.  It&#39;s been *very* useful to be able to shop and<br/>\nbank in Oggok from Cazic-Thule and Rathe Mts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 37th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be attacked by<br/>\n&gt; the guards<br/>\n&gt; and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally looked<br/>\n&gt; upon kindly<br/>\n&gt; or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep all your<br/>\n&gt; faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the guise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is, is it useful in any way to by disguised as a dark elf when<br/>\n&gt; attempting to enter the evil aligned cities or is the mask&#39;s illusion just<br/>\n&gt; some nice eye-candy that gives you infravision?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Faras </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
