Every one of<br/>\nthem says the same thing: low and mid levels aren&#39;t worthy to lick high<br/>\nlevel&#39;s boots, high levels are the Gods, and should be treated as such (my<br/>\nloose, but, i think, accurate interpretation of your posts here).  You&#39;re<br/>\nhigh level, live with the consequenses.  No one promised you endless<br/>\nexcitement, perfect hunting zones, and new territories at level 50.  You<br/>\nknew, pretty much from the start, that level 50 was the pinnacle.  You&#39;ve<br/>\nreached the end (well maybe not the end, but more like a pause, until the<br/>\nexpansion comes out) of your journey in EQ.  Why not do a little bit of<br/>\nexploring now?  Im sure you haven&#39;t seen ALL of Norrath.  Why, the last few<br/>\ndays have been quite enjoyable for me, hiding out in Runnyeye, exploring<br/>\nthe parts of it (still going in invis tho) that I was too afraid to see<br/>\nwhen I was of &quot;proper&quot; level to hunt there.  Found a merchant (wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nsell to me, go figure), a banker (killed one before I thought to try and<br/>\nactually &quot;bank&quot; there!-- it works!), a really nifty Slime Elemental that<br/>\nwas a little tricky to get to at first, and a gelatinous cube that I have<br/>\nyet to find, as well as some underwater passageways that I still have yet<br/>\nto explore.  Also, try trade skills, or doing some RP events for your<br/>\nguild, or just enjoying the company of the friends you have made in EQ.  <br/>\nOh, and another thing: puh-lease trim your messages to the smallest amount<br/>\nof quoting possible.  Its only good netiquette.<br/>\nCan we have a plonk or kabong or something on this thread here?<br/>\n<br/>\n/piss and vinegar mode off<br/>\n<br/>\nElwe Lay<br/>\n36 Songs (just last night-- yeah!)<br/>\nBard of the Kinship of Valor<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\nStill feedbacking the Surfing Nerf every day...<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\nMessage: 12<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 24 Jan 2000 21:04:43 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh that was 2 months ago roughly I guess when  he stated that the majority<br/>\nhad a 30-40 level char. By now it&#39;s easily up to 35-45 probably higher. So<br/>\nno your wrong and again their aren&#39;t problems at mid level you just want<br/>\nsomething to be added for it for the hell of it we don&#39;t we want it to be<br/>\nless crowded and able to hunt in zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n-------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
