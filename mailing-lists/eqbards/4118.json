I felt great when I was able to afford<br/>\n&gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that<br/>\n&gt;until after level 10.

The other <br/>\nnight while in East Karana, I was hunting for my next gorge hound victim, <br/>\nwhen a gnome warrior ran up to me and asked me for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was almost dead and lost, so I grouped with him and took him to the <br/>\nvillage by the Beholder zone to heal him.  Lo and behold when I actually <br/>\nlooked at him, I was shocked.  I am level 20, he was blue to me.  Yet he had <br/>\nrubicite, a unicorn shield, other items I can&#39;t remember now, but are just <br/>\nas rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, I would assume that the driver of the char had another higher <br/>\nlevel char with which he&#39;d twinked the lower one.  This was clearly not the <br/>\ncase.  The guy didnt know where Qeynos was, he was lost in East Karana, and <br/>\nhad no idea that the stuff he was sporting with such innocence was so hard <br/>\nto come by.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO someone totally ruined the game for this guy, and he will never even <br/>\nknow it.  Not only has the thrill of the loot been taken from him, among <br/>\nother things,  but other players will make his life a hard one because he is <br/>\ntwinked.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
