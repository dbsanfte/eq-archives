While Verant may classify<br/>\nincreasing the range an &quot;improvement&quot;, I had no problem with the effect<br/>\nradius of the song as it was.  The radius of the song has always been large<br/>\nenough to allow binding of all the mobs in the general vicinity of where I&#39;m<br/>\nfighting at.  I sure as hell don&#39;t want to aggro additional mobs that my<br/>\ngroup isn&#39;t fighting.  It may not be that big a deal in outside zones but in<br/>\ndungeons this could turn out to be nasty (assuming z-axis bug is still in<br/>\neffect for bard songs).  Anyone know if this song will aggro mobs through<br/>\nwalls in a dungeon?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLargo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>\nbehavior.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
