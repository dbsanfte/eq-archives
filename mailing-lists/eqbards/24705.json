That rep, in consultation with the other members of his class,<br/>\ndetermines the loot order for no-drop class-specific equipment.  Whether this is at the individual item<br/>\nlevel (e.g., a list for Imbrued BPs is separate from that for Imbrued Greaves), or just a rank order<br/>\n(player1, player2, player3 - when player1 loots something he drops to the end) is up to the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nDroppable class-specific stuff is awarded by the officers, usually following the directions of the class<br/>\nrep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll multi-class stuff is called by the officers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get an item upgrade, and your old item is droppable, you surrender the old item to the guild to be<br/>\ndistributed to another primary unless all primaries have something equivalent or  better.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to be actively on a raid to loot an item unless nobody else can (or wants to), in which case we<br/>\ncan start logging on alts and absent primaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds kind of free-form and complicated, but it has worked pretty well.  Some players have argued that<br/>\nthe officers reward themselves more than is &quot;fair&quot;, but I never felt that way.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
