A sign on the Paladin guild that<br/>\nsays, &quot;Deepwater Knights.  Followers of Prexuz&quot;.  It was spelled with a &quot;z&quot;<br/>\nnot an &quot;s&quot;.  It is possible that you MAY be taking a faction hit against<br/>\nthem *shrugs*.  I know if you kill the fish in the paladin/cleric pool in<br/>\nQeynos you take a faction hit against their god Rodcet Nife.  This does<br/>\nmake you KoS with the paladins and clerics in Qeynos.  All I can say is<br/>\nzone in to Erudin, con some paladins and leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:25 AM 3/14/00 -0300, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ericka &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andre.junqueira@...\">andre.junqueira@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello there guys =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been soloing NPCs from Kerra Island (the Catman people) for a while.<br/>\n&gt;They are really, really good exp at 18th lvl, not hard to solo, non<br/>\n&gt;carters, some of them spanw alone, fast spanw rate (no more than 5minutes)<br/>\n&gt;and a decent loot (around 4gp plus a skin worth 2gp).
