Being as you are L21 however, you probably won&#39;t be grouping<br/>\nwith too many as they probably are all higher level than you. As to<br/>\nother servers, a newer server might have some smarter players, but<br/>\nafter the first few weeks they would probably outlevel you as well.<br/>\nSigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is part of why I have grown tired of the game. Given there&#39;s not<br/>\nmuch to do at L49 where I am now, I&#39;ve tried starting new characters<br/>\nboth on my own server and on new servers, and I really find the run of<br/>\nthe mill people I can find to group with to be extremely bad at playing<br/>\nthe game (in general, there obviously are exceptions) As I was in with<br/>\nthe group of people who were among first to make 50 on my server, I am<br/>\nused to playing with people who are extremely good at playing their<br/>\ncharacters and understand how to play well with other characters as<br/>\nwell. I can really sympathise now with the frustration of people playing<br/>\nlower level characters trying to group as it&#39;s much harder to find good<br/>\nplayers to group with from what I can see, unless you run across some<br/>\nexperienced players playing their other characters, and they are likely<br/>\nto outlevel you quickly so you won&#39;t be able to play with them for long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
