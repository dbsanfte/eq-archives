The way I read it, casters<br/>\nbeing able to bind in a dungeon zone is a bug.  That would seem to indicate<br/>\nthat Verant&#39;s original intent was that casters could only bind in cities and<br/>\noutdoor zones.  I&#39;ve never heard that discussed anywhere before so that lead<br/>\nto my confusion on his statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not even be that big of a deal anyway.  Most casters I know bind<br/>\nthemselves in the zone right outside the dungeon entrance, i.e. bind in<br/>\nLavastorm if they are adventuring in Sol B.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We are also considering making it such that casters cannot bind in<br/>\n&gt; Expansion dungeons (the fact that they can now is actually a bug that is<br/>\n&gt; too late to fix for the rest of the world). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Brad <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Attachments have been removed from this message]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
