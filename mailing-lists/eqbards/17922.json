I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; quite content to just do the maid and butler room, and leave the hall and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kitchen alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t tried soloing there.  Maybe I should.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what level you can solo it, since I didn&#39;t try it solo until<br/>\n50.  Basically, I just invis into the butler room and do a CoC, Hymns, CoD,<br/>\nNiv&#39;s twist, switching to CoC, Chains, CoD, Chains when the mob is about<br/>\nready to run.  If the gargoyle is a flouting, I&#39;ll throw in a Charm every<br/>\nfew rounds, but that&#39;s mostly just to mitigate damage intake.  If it&#39;s a<br/>\njeering, I just AE both spots at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, pull the mob that&#39;s right outside into the butler room and finish it<br/>\noff with the AE twist.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, standing at the butler end of the maid/butler hallway, pull the<br/>\nclosest hall mob to the butler room, and AE it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPull the second maid/butler hall spawn to butler, AE it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you&#39;re left with just the two maid room spawns.  You can either (1)<br/>\nstand in the hallway green-pull the gargoyle (about 40% of the time the<br/>\nmaid/ph comes anyway), (2) lament the gargoyle and pull the maid/ph, or (3)<br/>\njust take them both at the same time in the maid room, like you did the<br/>\nbutler room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI generally don&#39;t have any problems with this technique, although a caster<br/>\nwill rarely take me down to a bubble.  I&#39;ve only had to zone once (make sure<br/>\nyou chain/pixie the mob, then fire up invis as you head out, so you don&#39;t<br/>\ntrain the castle).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Butler and Maid are rather easy, compared to their placeholders.  The<br/>\nButler may lead with Harm Touch, but after that my health stays steady.<br/>\nBoth die quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the cooks are still up, pull the mobs you&#39;re fighting as far away from<br/>\nthe kitchen side of the room as possible, so the cooks don&#39;t keep healing<br/>\nthem (although, the healing is rather minute).<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to leave the cooks alone unless I have a partner.  At 50, one is<br/>\nusually green and the other is usually blue.  I can pull them individually,<br/>\nbut the Harm Touch combined with their melee can really hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;m writing this, I just realized I haven&#39;t taken advantage of Chain/Fear<br/>\nin close fights at all in these rooms.  Dumb bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re 47+ (maybe lower; that&#39;s when I first duo&#39;ed the rooms), you&#39;re<br/>\nbetter off soloing than you are having a partner below 47.  The reason is,<br/>\nif you do get a runner (note: don&#39;t have runners) at 47+, you simply heal up<br/>\nwhile you wait for the mob to return; you can also chase it down past the<br/>\nkitchen.  If you have a partner who is below the &quot;green pull&quot; threshold, and<br/>\nyou have a runner, the castle is coming for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a partner, realize that buff songs/spells (ie, healing) will<br/>\nwork if one of you is sitting in each room.  A healing teammate is nice<br/>\nbecause you can pull out your Chants line to make the kills faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
