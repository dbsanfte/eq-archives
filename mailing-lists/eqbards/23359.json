They can make music with song and their<br/>\ninstruments can make (some) songs better.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the songs and if they are string, percussion, wind or brass, they<br/>\nwill be enhanced (have more power) when you sing them and have the<br/>\nappropriate instrument equipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome instruments give more power than others (in the same class: wind,<br/>\nstring, etc.)  The instruments bought in stores (from merchants) are the<br/>\nbase line.  See this for a chart of the instruments:  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqsongs.com/Instruments.htm\">http://www.eqsongs.com/Instruments.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqsongs.com/\">http://www.eqsongs.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBards at your level can learn the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; -- it&#39;s actually a<br/>\ncantana-tada-tina(tm) ;)  You can play a series of songs and do more damage<br/>\nto mobs than if you were to use your weapons.  You can learn to swap<br/>\ninstruments for maximum effect.  For example:  play Chords of Dissonace with<br/>\nlute; Heal song with lute; swap lute for brass horn and play Denon&#39;s<br/>\nDischord. Rinse, repeat.  Setting up a hot key pallette with your melee 2<br/>\nslot and 2 inventory slots helps with the swapping.  And once you get<br/>\ncomfortable, you can just leave the swapped out instrument on your mouse<br/>\ncursor.

I was<br/>\nscared from too many times singing chords to Corporal Lancot and just<br/>\navoided these good songs for way too long.

I&#39;m currently<br/>\nlevel 21 - actually now that I think about it, I&#39;m level 20, I died<br/>\nyesterday :(. Is just using my weapons in battle normal for my level? Should<br/>\nI expect to be using my instruments a lot more often when I hit a certain<br/>\nlevel?<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord uses Brass instruments and I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t used the song yet. Is it a useful song? I don&#39;t really like to sing<br/>\nAE songs in battle since it causes problems right quick - although I do like<br/>\nLargos as it has a pretty small radius. Are all of our good songs going to<br/>\nbe AE? Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord would be awesome if I could sing it<br/>\nwithout fear that I&#39;m going to pull everything in the zone...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
