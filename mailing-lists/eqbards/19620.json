We typically start up top,<br/>\ndrop down, hit the reaver room, crawl to the library, take 2 spawns, then<br/>\ncrawl to the church and camp there. We&#39;ve seen the raider every single time<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, we camped the library for tomes. In one night we saw 3 raiders.<br/>\nThey seem to be on at least twice the normal spawn for the dungeon. Spawn on<br/>\nthe dungeon is about 15-20 min. So if you have a raider spawn when you get<br/>\nthere, expect to wait 30-40 min for the next one. I&#39;m also guessing there<br/>\ncould be phs so that would mean if you got a ph, it would be 60-80 min in<br/>\nbetween.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, he&#39;s there a lot. If you want the coin, I suggest bringing a group<br/>\nand holding the library for 2 hours, I&#39;d virtually guarantee you leave with<br/>\na coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
