Cooperation is sometimes<br/>\nlimited and we have whole guilds of folks that simply don&#39;t play well with<br/>\nothers. Rule of thumb is whoever gets there first and god help you if you<br/>\nget wiped out first try. Dragons on Xegony usually die pretty fast, although<br/>\nVox is a bit off the beaten track and can be up a bit longer than most. I<br/>\nwould guess the aveage lifespan of a dragon on Xegony to be no more than a<br/>\ncouple hours. You may consider parking a toon that can track in Perma.<br/>\n My advice is still to try and get into Ragefire camps for red scales and<br/>\nwatch for Gore as much as possible. If you can get into a Vox/Naggy raid, do<br/>\nit. It will probably take you several levels before you have all the pieces.<br/>\nHelping people with Gore/Vox/Nag/Trak/Rage gets your name known and brownie<br/>\npoints built. You will need them if you spot Vox up and when you get ready<br/>\nto spawn Trak for your last step. My guild has some Vox level toons and we<br/>\nneed a frost book for one of our main paladins. If you spot her up one<br/>\nnight, give me a tell and we will see who  we have that can come help.<br/>\nWe did finally get Kaas&#39; epic finished this weekend. Ever had the luck to be<br/>\nsitting in Trak&#39;s lair, waiting on the undead bard only to have Trak spawn?<br/>\nWhat fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
