Have you ever<br/>\n&gt;kited a SG up and down the coast in Oasis?  If not then you are probably<br/>\n&gt;doing things right.  I myself have died to irresponsible kiters numerous<br/>\n&gt;times.  What occurs is the fact that the kiter with JBoots or SOW starts<br/>\n&gt;to outrun the MOB.  The mob still continues to chase you but it will mob<br/>\n&gt;anything near it.  Trust me I know, I have died to it while looting a dead<br/>\n&gt;mob, looting my corpse, while a druid ran by me and even while medding in<br/>\n&gt;the desert.  Now was this druid kiting?  Of course she was because she was<br/>\n&gt;having a discussion with some other druids and necros about kiting the<br/>\n&gt;giants in Oasis.  Let me say that kiting is not bad when done properly,<br/>\n&gt;when done wrong it it is downright detestable and those people should<br/>\n&gt;suffer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
