I unequiped my two bracers that provide AC8 (I think)<br/>\n&gt; and took a look at my AC total and it dropped by 15 points.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; this is just a guess but it is possible that the material value is<br/>\n&gt; factored into the AC total, so a piece of AC5 mesh(like chain) adds 8 to<br/>\n&gt; your overall AC and AC5 plate adds 10 to your overall AC.  Thereby making<br/>\n&gt; it quite viable to go for a full suit of plate armor, since this will tip<br/>\n&gt; the scales in your favour for damage resists.  Can anyone verify this<br/>\n&gt; hypothesis?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The character AC numbers have little to do with the armor AC numbers.  The<br/>\nreason is historic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn early beta, the character AC number was simply a sum of all the armor AC<br/>\nnumbers.  Verant had intended to hide ALL numbers in the game originally<br/>\nand in an effort to obfuscate the character AC number they changed it from<br/>\na simple sum to a percentage.  A value of 100 equivalent to a 50th level<br/>\nWarrior with maxed stats in the best possible armor (but without buffs).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this meant that small changes in the AC percentage didn&#39;t show.<br/>\nSince it was anti-climatic to put on your first piece of leather and see<br/>\nno change in the character AC number, they instead made the scale in<br/>\n1/1000ths instead of 1/100ths.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, they never did get around to hiding the numbers on the items,<br/>\nmaking Libretto and similar spells much less useful and adding a lot of<br/>\nconfusion about character AC vs armor AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe that the AC number only shows part of the armor stats, and<br/>\nthat there are more complex effects than just the raw AC...  I have no<br/>\nexperemental data to prove or disprove this theory though...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Speaking of beta, just got my Asheron&#39;s Call beta letter today.  I think<br/>\n    I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s possible to be anything like a Bard in that system...<br/>\n    I suspect I&#39;ll just end up as some sort of tank-mage.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
