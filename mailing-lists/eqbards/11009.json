I am new to this list, but not a new<br/>\nbard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on<br/>\nInnoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a<br/>\nhurry to level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level 31<br/>\nsong, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>\nmessage I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>\nfloating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>\nthe song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>\ncycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>\nthat it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>\njust acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did<br/>\nnot function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>\nthis song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rosha Crist<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Attachments have been removed from this message]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
