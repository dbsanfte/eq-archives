Turns out the guy who <br/>\nblurted it out over guildsay was full of shiite as I had suspected. =P<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lute still (sadly) has no special effect for String songs. I personally <br/>\nthink they should make it at least 15% more powerful than a store-bought. <br/>\nWould be worth the pain in ass it is to acquire, aside from the new quest <br/>\nbeing implemented tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I kill the offshoot of my thread?
