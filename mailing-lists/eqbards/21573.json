I have the Star of Odus - guild brother got it<br/>\nfor me and delivered it to me so I didn&#39;t have to boat over to Erudin = ).<br/>\nI am now officially collecting the coins.  One thing you mentioned below was<br/>\nturning in Drolvarg fangs.  I assume this is a quest we can do similar to<br/>\nthe Blackburrow gnoll fangs of way back when except here the xp seems pretty<br/>\ngood.  Where do you find Drolvargs, what level do you need to be to hunt<br/>\nthem (you are 40, but were you solo or in a group with higher or lower<br/>\nmates), how did you hunt them (charm kite, chant kite, both, group,...) and<br/>\nfinally, who do you turn them into?  And when you said 3 pixels, did you<br/>\nmean 3 xp bar sections?  If so, wow!  Please, if others have info on<br/>\nDrolvargs, please share it with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Original Message:<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 27 Sep 2000 09:39:23 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Tambourine Quest Details....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i just got my tamborine last night and i must say im<br/>\n&gt; a happy camper, it gave<br/>\n&gt; me 2 pixels in level 40! that and i handed in 56<br/>\n&gt; drolvarg fangs at the same<br/>\n&gt; time, so i got 3 pixels for all of that stuff,<br/>\n&gt; needless to say i was happy<br/>\n&gt; the bloody captain was finally where he was supposed<br/>\n&gt; to be.

Please post the links and maybe even some<br/>\nof the how to(if you haven&#39;t already).  Kit and Windleaf, great ideas for<br/>\nmissed notes.  I almost played around with the new stuff last night, but I<br/>\nknew you all would have some great ideas here today.  Way to go(again)!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nPie<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal Message:<br/>\nMessage: 9<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 28 Sep 2000 14:18:03 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI will tell you what has changed - voice recognition.  The moment<br/>\nthe EQ team started down that path, most of these command line changes were<br/>\ninevitable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat you guys need are programmable keyboards&#92;keypads.  I have a<br/>\n58-key programmable keypad I use to do all sorts of things -- its primary<br/>\nuse however is to give me direction keys on BOTH ends of the keyboard, as<br/>\nwell as a better layout for hotkeys, etc.  Not to mention I can switch<br/>\nhot-key banks, and press a hot key button with a simple push of a key.<br/>\nSince the implementation of all these keyboard commands, I can do damn near<br/>\nany command or sequence of commands in EQ with my keypad at the push of a<br/>\nsingle button.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe price range of the programmable keypads on the internet is<br/>\nanywhere from 24.95 (a cheap 20-key type) on up.  There are two available<br/>\nfrom one particular company in 20 ($85) and 58 ($130) key models that allow<br/>\nkey labeling and everything .  If you guys are interested I can post some<br/>\nlinks for your perusal.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
