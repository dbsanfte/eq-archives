The<br/>\nonly reason I stopped using Forage is now with the ease of summoning food I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to keep a whole backpack to store all the different kinds of<br/>\nforaged food.  Otherwise, yes... 1 vote here for using Foraged.  In my<br/>\nexperience, it&#39;s good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nHide is a different story... I have it hotkeyed but would never rely on it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s fun for parlor tricks.  : )  I don&#39;t mind it failing most of the time,<br/>\nit&#39;s just not knowing if it&#39;s failed or not that&#39;s a bad design.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
