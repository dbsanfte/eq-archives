No one<br/>\n&gt;forged stainless steel in those days.  (Come to think of it, maybe the EQ<br/>\n&gt;plate is made of stainless steel.)

It&#39;s far superior in<br/>\nquality to the material from &quot;oh so long ago&quot;,  but there are NUMEROUS<br/>\nperiods we could be discussing here.  Greek-style Bell Cuirass, to Spanish<br/>\nhalf-plate.  Gothic armor to ribbed plate.  But steel has been around MUCH<br/>\nlonger than I think you are aware.  Ancient Assyrians knew how to make it.<br/>\nThe Chinese were forging steel during the Han dynasty (400 BC)  But history<br/>\nis neither here nor there - we&#39;re playing a fantasy game ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I think platemail, I picture full plate - of which numerous examples<br/>\nstill remain (not the least of which were several suits belonging to Henry<br/>\nVIII, a VERY large man, if his armour had anything to say about it.  This<br/>\nwas forged with steel (though not the stainless and spring steel my<br/>\nroommate is using), and worked to a specific set of dimensions, made for a<br/>\nsingle owner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole idea of a knight being knocked off of his horse and dying<br/>\n&quot;trapped like a turtle&quot; is patently absurd, and far far from the truth.<br/>\nEven the heaviest of armour could still be sat up in, and no warrior in his<br/>\nright mind would wear so much that he could not maneuver in combat. This<br/>\napplies in our game as well.  Like the EverCrest comic a couple of weeks<br/>\nago, with the Wizard in full plate.  &quot;WTF?&quot;<br/>\n;)<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
