Makes sense<br/>\n(to me), since even a lowly hand drum increases the speed of selos.  Even a<br/>\nlowly mandolin increases the effect of Hymn.  I think a drum that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nenhance the percussion song just violates every aspect of the idea of the EQ<br/>\nbard, and how our &quot;magic&quot; works.  The only way I see offhand to fix this, is<br/>\nfor there to come to light a quest that would cause the drums to work.<br/>\nWhile that would make drums that don&#39;t work understandable, I hardly think<br/>\nthat would be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Essam Khairullah [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olgwinn@...\">olgwinn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 6:43 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Drums of the Beast - walking?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I just tried out Selo&#39;s on the Drums of the Beast.  While weilding these<br/>\n<br/>\ndrums and playing either version of Selo&#39;s doesn&#39;t work.  Even walking <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help.  You run standard run speed and walk standard walk speed, as <br/>\nthough you weren&#39;t playing Selo&#39;s at all.  In fact, weilding a sword and <br/>\nsinging Selo&#39;s gives you SOME improvement in speed, but as far as I can <br/>\ntell, Drums of the Beast and Selo&#39;s are 100% incompatible.  I even made <br/>\nmention of that fact in an email to the Developers Corner on the official EQ<br/>\n<br/>\nmessage board earlier this week, but of course it could have been routed to <br/>\n/dev/null for all the difference it made.  It hasn&#39;t even been posted, much <br/>\nless responded to.  And it was quite a professional non-rant... hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am led to one conclusion.  I read an email somewhere, I don&#39;t even <br/>\nremember where, may even have been here, that the new high-level weapons, <br/>\narmor, misc. drops lately have all been items that are really incredibly <br/>\ngood, except for one stat that ruins it.  So each item has a drawback that <br/>\nmakes you really have to think whether you will use it or not.  In effect, <br/>\nallowing them to create lots of new items for us to drool over without <br/>\nactually making them overpowering.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bug with the runspeed <br/>\nrolling over, but I&#39;m sure that Verant will consider the incompatability of <br/>\nthese drums and Selo&#39;s to be a &quot;feature&quot; as part of the &quot;Vision(tm)&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>\nsure it won&#39;t bother them one bit that this particular &quot;feature&quot; only <br/>\naffects a handful of players and they&#39;ll save money by not having to fix, <br/>\nerr, &quot;enhance&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s my 2cp worth.  It would be nice if it worked, but it&#39;s such an <br/>\nawesome drum otherwise, I&#39;m not really going to complain.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nCrimson Legacy<br/>\nBard of 54, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
