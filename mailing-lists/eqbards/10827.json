I<br/>\nused my wizard (level 42) and had a level 50 wizard helping clear<br/>\nas many solusek goblins as we could.  For 5 hours there was also<br/>\nanother group in the king room clearing that and several<br/>\nother nearby gobs, that were helping me look for boots.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlucky I guess, almost all the other items were under 30 minutes,<br/>\nI still need both items for the helmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nLudvaraman (aka Ludde)<br/>\nLevel 27 bard<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have seen a couple of comments on how hard Icy Greaves are to get.<br/>\n&gt; This example matches my own experience, that they were easy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went to king room twice. Once there was a group there i asked about<br/>\n&gt; looting icy greaves, they said they needed 4 pair (no bards in group...<br/>\n&gt; go figure). That night I returned and got in a group camping king room,<br/>\n&gt; they had cleared the room, next round (2nd or 3rd elite) I got greaves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you decide to go to the room invis, beware, the Goblin Wizard can see<br/>\n&gt; invis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt; 32nd Bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>\n&gt; &gt; on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; this quest, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
