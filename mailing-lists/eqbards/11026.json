Stop being so paranoid that <br/>\n&gt;Verant hates your class only.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ummm actually, no, sorry.  Levitate is only broken for people who need to <br/>\nrefresh it constantly to use it.  Other classes are now limited to their 5 <br/>\nor 10 or 20 minute duration, whatever the case.  Bards are now limited to at <br/>\nmost 18 seconds of flight.  This is not the same thing at all.  The purpose <br/>\nof the song is to allow people to travel in places they otherwise couldn&#39;t.  <br/>\nOther classes still can with levitate, bards can&#39;t.  Do casters fall to the <br/>\nground every 18 seconds when levitating?  No.  Thus yes, it does affect only <br/>\nour class.<br/>\n<br/>\nRumor has it that this patch was intended to fix a problem with the Pegasus <br/>\nCloak (off Quillmane in SK - I think the item name is something like that).  <br/>\nIt seems that by hitting the proc (unlimited charges) over and over you <br/>\ncould rise very fast into the air.  Verant, in their infinite wisdom, fixed <br/>\nthis problem by making it impossible to refresh any levitate effect.  Had <br/>\nany bard-players been on the develpoment team you would think (I certainly <br/>\nwould, in any case) that the obvious effect on bards would be, well, <br/>\nobvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE /bug this and /feedback this until they fix it.  Do not stop because <br/>\nyou heard a rumor that it was unintentional, or because they say they will <br/>\nfix it soon.  The more they hear from us, the more it will be a priority for <br/>\nthe development team.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\nfrustrated red-headed stepchild</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
