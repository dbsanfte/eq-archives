They are not even long lasting.  In<br/>\ngeneral, the effects we create only last for a few seconds after we stop<br/>\nsinging or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it is a permanent<br/>\nchange to the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one exception to this is the charismatic catillion, which lasts until we<br/>\nzone...and that somehow makes sense.  I picture myself going into town and<br/>\nsinging to a merchant who loves the ballads of my adventures and tells all her<br/>\nfriends about me.  As soon as I leave town they forget all about Sarsa and<br/>\nlisten to the next Bard who comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there was a bind song it could only keep us bound for as long as we sang<br/>\nit.  Not practical.  Even if we did get a permanent bind, could you imagine<br/>\nhow loud the other melees would scream?  If all 7 melee types died in Guk and<br/>\ndied in Freeport at the same time and started running back, who would arrive<br/>\nfirst without outside aid?  The bards of course!  We already have the<br/>\nadvantage over all other melee classes in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, it makes more sense for all hybrids EXCEPT Bards to be able to<br/>\nbind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarsa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
