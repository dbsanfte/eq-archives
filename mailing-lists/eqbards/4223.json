I have no<br/>\nidea what a RTS is, real time strategy?  I have probably heard the<br/>\ndefinition of it, and forgotten.  If a salesman pitches me his products in a<br/>\nlingo that I don&#39;t understand, it is a bad sales pitch, and I won&#39;t be<br/>\nbuying anything from him.  He lost a sale.

Bah!  Speak english for crying out<br/>\nloud!  I spend enough time learning other features of the game without<br/>\nhaving to memorize vocabulary lists at night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
