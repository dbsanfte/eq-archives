Raw data is raw data.  It&#39;s NOT the<br/>\nleast bit useful to a beginning bard.  Seeing 40 lists of people&#39;s stats is<br/>\nnot going to educate someone on the ramifications of low strength up the<br/>\nroad.  If they don&#39;t know that 75 str means you can&#39;t wear bronze already<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll figure that out if they see 40 posts of people with 90+<br/>\nstrength.  If you want to help young bards - put together of FAQ (This list<br/>\nneeds one bad - but I do confess I&#39;m too lazy to do it myself!)  If you want<br/>\nthis to be useful - then perhaps asking people to post WHY they selected the<br/>\nstats they did - particularly if they restarted their char.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve participated in several Internet Email Mailing lists that have gone<br/>\nfrom great-to-mediocre-to-worse and then I sadly drop out.  &quot;Surveys&quot; on the<br/>\nlist has been problem on some.  I believe answers to surveys belong OFF of<br/>\nthe list and in private Email.  Anyone interested can request the info from<br/>\nthe person taking the Survey.  The person building the survey will then post<br/>\nthe results and everyone is interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bandwidth.  I AM on several other lists.  When I have to download<br/>\n85-150 emails off my mailserver - it takes a significant amount of time.  I<br/>\ngo out of town and for several days and that number snowballs.  If 250<br/>\npeople respond to a survey on a 250 person list that&#39;s 62,500 emails.<br/>\nCertainly this isn&#39;t going to have any impact on the Internet as a whole -<br/>\nand perhaps not even OneList&#39;s server.  But if 62,500 emails doesn&#39;t<br/>\nconstitute SPAM - I don&#39;t know what does...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn-My-Humble-Opinion - this is one of the best lists I&#39;ve been on.  As of<br/>\nlate my rating of it has dropped a bit.  We&#39;ve had a few flame wars and the<br/>\ntwinking subject that seemed to refuse to die.  Mailing lists constitute a<br/>\n&quot;Community&quot; (read Esther Dyson&#39;s 2.0 about this - it&#39;s a great book).<br/>\n&quot;Communities&quot; need rules.  I&#39;m am absolutely willing to accede to the will<br/>\nof the majority.  My vote - keep survey raw data to private email keep it<br/>\noff the list.  If the majority of the group disagrees - I&#39;ll happily shut up<br/>\n(or unfortunately leave if I find that 90 pct of the postings don&#39;t interest<br/>\nme anymore as had happened on other Mailing Lists I was on)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly - please don&#39;t take this as a flame - I respect your opinion  - I just<br/>\nrespectfully disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 01, 1999 12:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Base Stat Survey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James Schuldes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stop with this bandwidth b.s. - the internet is made out of huge<br/>\nbandwidth.<br/>\n&gt; Even 200 emails on bard stats is not gonna make your modem light blink.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Boring to you is another issue - but dont say bandwidth when you mean<br/>\n&gt; boring.  Delete or filter stuff you dont wanna read.  (hehe you can prolly<br/>\n&gt; &quot;killfile&quot; me and save half your &quot;bandwidth&quot; &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is valuable info for young bards here -- when you are young is the<br/>\n&gt; time to know how you compare.  For example, with my lowly 75 in str - I<br/>\nCANT<br/>\n&gt; carry a full set of bronze.  If you wanna be a bard and wear plate and<br/>\nwear<br/>\n&gt; bronze plate, then you better have alot of str.  I got lots of str booster<br/>\n&gt; and am bearly able to walk around with a minimal amount of stuff and all<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; visible bronze pieces except boots - cant wear with being encumbered from<br/>\n&gt; the git go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if there are young bards out there who want plate, then they need to<br/>\n&gt; know - cuz a restart at level 5 is LOTS better than a restart at level 15.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel P.
