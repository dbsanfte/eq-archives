I mean Kaz, if it was as easy and beneficial as you describe<br/>\ndon&#39;t you think a lot<br/>\nof Bards would be doing it? There&#39;s a lot of people on this list that have<br/>\nplayed them for 2+<br/>\nyears and while very few of us may be &quot;hard-core&quot; gamers, the majority of us<br/>\ncan key mash with the<br/>\nbest of &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious if any of the BOTB competing Bards, especially those that made<br/>\nit a couple rounds,<br/>\nhave any comments. This would kinda be the acid test. If they, the truly<br/>\nhard-core crowd, twisted<br/>\nfour or more songs when efficiency, effectiveness and quick thinking were<br/>\nall needed for survival,<br/>\nthen I would think more seriously about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Christopher Sanders &lt;christopher.sanders@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;tt&gt;<br/>\nA macro cannot adjust to a missed note, and becomes a liability in the<br/>\ncase&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nof repeated missed notes.&nbsp; I tried it, a while back.&nbsp; You can&#39;t<br/>\npick up&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nwhere you missed a note.&nbsp; The social has to start at the beginning<br/>\nagain,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nonce you manage to stop it, and start it again.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nA macro also cannot change the math (since you like math) involved, in<br/>\ncast&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ntimes, and duration times.&nbsp; While I haven&#39;t sat down and formulated all<br/>\nthe&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\npossible combinations (I&#39;d rather spend what little free time I get<br/>\nplaying&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nthe game), I&#39;m relatively certain that there is no combination of songs<br/>\nthat&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nallows for a true, no dropped effects, 5 song twist.&nbsp; You will get<br/>\ndropped&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\neffects, and, in my opinion, any &quot;twist&quot; that inherently drops<br/>\neffects, is&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nno twist at all.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nFeel free to continue to disagree, however, you can&#39;t change the fact<br/>\nthat,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nif dropped effects don&#39;t matter, then we can all twist 8 songs<br/>\neffortlessly.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nAtonal&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n-----Original Message-----&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nFrom: KAZ [mailto:kazvorpal@...]&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 15, 2002 9:05 AM&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nTo: eqbards@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] twisting 5, added note&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n--- John Grady &lt;john_grady@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is funny.
