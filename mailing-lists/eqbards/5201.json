My<br/>\n&gt; regrets that your Brass skills are poor, perhaps a little practice is in<br/>\n&gt; order.

If you&#39;ve done testing, then show<br/>\nus<br/>\nthe numbers.  So far everyone who has posted numbers, as far as I can tell,<br/>\nis<br/>\nshowing perfectly reasonable missed note rates.  If you have evidence to the<br/>\ncontrary, if anyone does, we can start to reasonably believe there&#39;s a<br/>\ndifference, but most people seem to not be experiencing what you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it is server specific, btw, since John Kim, who also says his<br/>\nmissed note rates are up, is on the same server as I am, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nexperienced it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\nFor details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
