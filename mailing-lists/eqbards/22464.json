I noticed that in-game, you cannot add bindings like shift-numpad#, or alt-numpad#, but it supports it, you just have to change it in the ini file.  Also, in game (at the keyboard mappings page), you left click on the first binding spot, and to access the second binding spot, right click on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn important thing to note....be sure you unbind any keys that are using SHIFT-NUMPAD#....else the game will execute both commands at the same time.   (Oh yeah...I&#39;m using &quot;bind&quot; to refer to keyboard assignments...it&#39;s an old Quake habit of mine :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed some stuff that they didn&#39;t put in the patch message.<br/>\n1) They moved CTRL-# casting to ALT-# casting (too near the Winblows key)  (but this can be rebound to ctrl-#)<br/>\n2) ALT-casting now works for Bards<br/>\n3) A lot of the / commands (like /sit /camp) now work while we&#39;re singing songs.<br/>\n4) You can use one hot key bank for your full inventory and two slots from your equipment list (like melee 1 and 2)...since you can open backpacks in full screen mode, there&#39;s no reason to go to the inventory screen now.<br/>\n5) there&#39;s a bunch more keyboard shortcuts like CTRL-B for spellbook, CTRL-D for disband, CTRL-I for invite/follow, CTRL-S for sitting/standing, etc...check your keyboard mappings in game, or read the ini file : )<br/>\n<br/>\nCouple more things that I like about the patch...the turning off attacking on autoassisting (our cleric tends to un-mez every mob sometimes when she&#39;s trying to heal :)   Since I&#39;m so used to using 6 keys for spells, etc, I can use the next four keys for my weapons and inventory (I&#39;m compulsive about always knowing what I have in my hands...this way I can see it on all my hotkey banks : )     108 new socials means we can do a lot of fun stuff  (for you jokesters...get someone to make you a suit of brown plate armor...then run around poking ppl and saying &quot;Can&#39;t catch me &#39;cause I&#39;m the Gingerbread Man!&quot;  (hehe...or Woman : )).<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ve talked enough....happy hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, happy on Tarew Marr.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
