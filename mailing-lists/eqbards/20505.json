Since the chain nerf, I have not tried using it.  My<br/>\nold crew with the SK who used to insist on doing the Darknessing has not<br/>\nbeen together in quite sometime.   Currently, I group with a cleric and we<br/>\ndo the root/dot/nuke thing.  The cleric roots and refeshes root often while<br/>\nI sing DoT&#39;s with my Selos drum.  When they (spectres in TT) get low, the<br/>\ncleric will stun, banish undead, stun to prevent them from gating.  Although<br/>\nthe ones we have been camping, dont gate all that far.  Funny thing is, if<br/>\nthey are rooted and gate, they are still rooted when they re-appear at their<br/>\nbind points - heh.  So, I just keep Dot&#39;ing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Tomerrilin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS.
