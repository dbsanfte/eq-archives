Not only that, the frequency with which mobs were<br/>\nbreaking out of song effects seems to have increased (either<br/>\nthat or the random number generator is really crappy).  I mean<br/>\nat level 29, you&#39;d think a green drybone wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\ninstantly break out of four Chains in a row.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Another feature I would like to see is a pop-up to one side that has all<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; pet commands. Anytime you have a pet to control either you have this popup<br/>\n&gt; or a button like social that lists all the pet commands.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you right-click on a social button, you can rename and<br/>\nreconfigure it.  Create buttons for all your favorite pet<br/>\ncommands and put them on your hotkeys.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
