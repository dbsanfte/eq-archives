IMO it is <br/>\nbroken and also IMO should be one of our defining songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to see from the song is the ability to go to places <br/>\nBards are not normally able to go, such as the Troll/Orge cities. It <br/>\nis our function after all to document the history of Norrath,record  <br/>\nthe stories of all races, and to bring a song to many different faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will feedback this tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anybody else found level 11 to be a bit of a wall? I am finding it <br/>\nhard going.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Walsh, Video Coding Group<br/>\nTeltec Ireland, DCU, Dublin 9, Ireland<br/>\nTel     : +353-1-7045477<br/>\nFAX     : +353-1-7045092<br/>\nE-mail  : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:walsht@...\">walsht@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
