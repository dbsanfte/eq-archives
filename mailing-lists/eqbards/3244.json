Then, they started camping it to get everyone in<br/>\ntheir guild a Rubicite Breastplate, which also comes from the Avatar. Well,<br/>\nthe Claw is a lot more common on the Avatar than the Rubi is, so they have<br/>\ngotten a surplus of claws.  I was their second customer almost 2 weeks ago,<br/>\nand the &quot;I have a neato unique weapon&quot; feeling has worn off as I now see<br/>\nquite a few people around mid 20th level running around with one. Asking<br/>\nthem, they, too, paid 500pp for one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought mine for 500pp. I had almost 2000 pp in the bank, and from what I<br/>\ncan tell, money is practically USELESS in this game. There&#39;s nothing I can<br/>\nBUY that is better than what I have. I am a foraging god, so food and water<br/>\nI never have to buy. The only expenditure I have is for my new song every<br/>\nlevel, and I can find loot for that enough within 30 mins of when I log on.<br/>\nSo, some people have said, &quot;Tallonn, you paid 500pp for that claw??? But it<br/>\naint that GOOD!!&quot; to which I reply &quot;My friend, just what the heck else am I<br/>\ngonna spend all my money on?&quot; I give tons of money away to lower level<br/>\nplayers (all my silver and copper goes to young ones). So the only thing I<br/>\nhave to do with my money is buy an ocassional item from someone, like the<br/>\nclaw. I am not powerful enough to get one myself. I also have bought<br/>\nRubicite armor for ridiculous amounts. Why? Well, the camping is becoming<br/>\nattrocious. This is probably my biggest pet-peeve about the game, the huge<br/>\nabundance of camping. You get 18 people all stuffed in the throneroom in<br/>\nCazic Thule, and you&#39;ll see &quot;fun&quot; at its best. People are grouchy, people<br/>\nare greedy, people cry when they think you grabbed a lone sentinel you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have, and then you have groups that come there with the sole<br/>\nintent of kill-stealing.  So, don&#39;t camp, go somewhere else. And just like<br/>\nsomeone else here mentioned, those areas are quickly becoming overpopulated,<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I digress. I am good at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is the claw WORTH it to YOU? That is for YOU to decide. I think it is<br/>\nworth 500pp. In my opinion, it&#39;s better than a Tommy, better than a Whip,<br/>\nand neck and neck with a Dirk. I know that since I have started<br/>\ndual-wielding a claw and a dirk, my stamina has NEVER, EVER dropped below 4<br/>\nbubbles, while with the Tommy, I was always at half stamina within a few<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lastly, the claw just looks so dang cool. Vain, I know, but to me,<br/>\nlooks are important. (Smile)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper&#39;s worth<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - Bard of the 34th Verse<br/>\nBertox<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 09, 1999 12:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Demon Claw (Bladed Thulian)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, is a demon claw worth 500 pp?
