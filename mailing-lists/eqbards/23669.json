Fighting in the same zone<br/>\nfor an extended period of time bores me.  However, I have been trying to get<br/>\na Harmonic Dagger and/or Partisan from Karnors to upgrade my weapons.<br/>\nCurrently I am using a Journeyman Walking Stick and Martune Rapier.  The JWS<br/>\nis a good weapon for bards since it procs Tashani.  I need to upgrade the<br/>\nMartune Rapier though.  There are a lot of other zones I can get EXP in, but<br/>\nat least in Karnors I can get good EXP plus a chance at getting one of the<br/>\ntwo weapons.  With that said, I am about to give up on actually ever looting<br/>\na Partisan or Harmonic Dagger.  I&#39;ve killed the caller of Sathir so many<br/>\ntimes I have lost count.  He has dropped the kunzar cloak every time.   Have<br/>\nnever been able to get into a hand/jail group to camp the drolvarg warlord<br/>\nfor the HD.  So I&#39;m thinking, for a change of pace, to instead head to<br/>\nSebilis and hopefully get some Singing Steel pieces instead of upgrading my<br/>\nweapons.  However, if Sebilis at 51 is over my head, then I will stick to<br/>\nKarnors.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

For those of you with a lot of<br/>\nexperience hunting in that zone, would like your feedback.  Since all of the<br/>\nmobs there will be 45+, I assume Pixie Strike will not be that effective.<br/>\nNot certain how well Charm will work.  I know once I get to 53 and get SoT<br/>\nthen crowd control will be a lot easier.  But until then, how effective will<br/>\nI be at performing crowd control in Sebilis?  Would it be smarter to hang<br/>\nout in Karnors and other zones until I get to 53 and head to Sebilis then?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
