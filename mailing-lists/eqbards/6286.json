What I was talking <br/>\nabout is NOT killing guards in the newbie zones, but actually going into the <br/>\ncity zone.  This is something completely different and much more dangerous, <br/>\nespecially when the ninja shopkeepers join in.  I saw one of these Ninja <br/>\nMerchants kill a Hill Giant in East Karana last (I have no idea how the <br/>\nfight started).  She was double punching the HG for 132 yikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Richard Ashkettle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richard_ashkettle@...\">richard_ashkettle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Level 50 options was:RE: [eqbards] Instruments vs. Melee quandry<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1999 11:34:29 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Richard Ashkettle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richard_ashkettle@...\">richard_ashkettle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK,<br/>\n&gt;BEFORE this gets KABONG&#39;d..and it will, no doubt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You have hit on my PERSONAL PET PEEVE.  NOTHING annoys<br/>\n&gt;my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>\n&gt;zones and killing the guards there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>\n&gt;Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>\n&gt;guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>\n&gt;level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>\n&gt;players running to them is around level 1 to 3.<br/>\n&gt;I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>\n&gt;(with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>\n&gt;enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>\n&gt;high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>\n&gt;lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>\n&gt;Shada...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>\n&gt;must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>\n&gt;  All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>\n&gt;BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Windolas Stormsong (MM)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
