He offered<br/>\nme a helluva lot of money for it all.  I laughed in his face.  Told him that I<br/>\nhad been working on completing the quests ever since they came out in the patch.<br/>\nNo way was I gonna sell it and do the quests all over again.  He bumped his<br/>\noffer by 1000PP.  Put him on the /ignore list.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night was running through EC on my way to Solusek Temple to complete the<br/>\nlambent breastplate quest.  Someone was auctioning a lambent breastplate for<br/>\nsell.  Sent him a /tell that I was interested in knowing his asking price.  He<br/>\nsaid 3000-5000 PP or items of equal trade. Also told me that he had already sold<br/>\nthree breastplates for that price.  I would have thought that they sold for no<br/>\nmore than 1000PP.  Only cost me 270PP to buy the two rubies.  Guess these newbie<br/>\nbard twinks have a lot of money to throw around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  The wizard no doubt has a L5 bard he&#39;s ready to twink up.  Everyone wants to<br/>\n&gt; play a bard now, it seems.
