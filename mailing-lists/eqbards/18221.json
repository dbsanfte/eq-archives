I grouped with a guildmate<br/>\n&gt; and had her go to the top of the ramp to the Paladin guild in FV.  I then<br/>\n&gt; ran down the bank to the base of the tower so that I was directly<br/>\nunderneath<br/>\n&gt; her.  I then played HoR.  She felt no affects.  I then ran about 1/2 way<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; the bank and had her walk down the ramp.  Still no affects.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil<br/>\n&gt; I came back up to her level that her wounds started healing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FYI,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tomerrilin </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
