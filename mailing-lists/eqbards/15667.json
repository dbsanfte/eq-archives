You have<br/>\nto mention that when the healer heals you, the extras will be<br/>\nall over *their* healer.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>\n&gt; actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>\n&gt; It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>\n&gt; damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>\n&gt; engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>\n&gt; speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>\n&gt; tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>\n&gt; they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if everyone is assisting and the extra mob is going to<br/>\nbeat up on the bard anyways, you might as well play Largo&#39;s.  <br/>\n:)  So I don&#39;t see Largo&#39;s as having any effect on the<br/>\ncomparison.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real unknown in this is how much better is a real tank at<br/>\ntanking than a bard.  If a real tank can take 75% the damage<br/>\nof a bard or less, then it makes more sense to fight both at<br/>\nonce.  That&#39;s for evenly splitting your resources though.  <br/>\nThe best strategy would be one tank on the extra, everyone<br/>\nelse fights the primary target.
