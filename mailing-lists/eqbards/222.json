If you plan on staying right around Freeport for a while and do not<br/>\nplan on travelling then you could probably do without the drum. If you want<br/>\nto travel far distances then the drum is very nice to cut the time down (not<br/>\nto mention a greater ability to outrun darn near anything). For now the lute<br/>\nwill only boost your heal by 2 hps a pulse and increase the damage (and<br/>\nrange?) of Chords.<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Daniel P.

I am a half-elf Bard on<br/>\nXegony.  I have been operating in the Freeport areas mostly - and hope to<br/>\nstart some travelling in the near future...<br/>\n<br/>\n        I JUST made level 8 and have a few questions.  Since I just made 8<br/>\nand can develop String Instruments - should I sell my drum after getting the<br/>\nlute?  Is there any need for both?  (Obviously a concern is carrying slots).<br/>\nIs there a difference between the lute and the mandolin?<br/>\n<br/>\n        Lastly - I am always short of money.  Most of my money goes to<br/>\nsongs - my armor is pretty thin.  Any suggestions for making money.<br/>\n<br/>\n        I apologize if these questions have been answered many times<br/>\nbefore - as I am new to the list.  If there is a searchable archive<br/>\nsomewhere - please point me there!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n    Slyde<br/>\n    AKA Dan Sniderman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
