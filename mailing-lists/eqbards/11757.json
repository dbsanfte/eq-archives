Does the first one to lvl 50 get a cookie that no one told<br/>\n&gt; me about?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The measure I&#39;m using is the total sum of enjoyment across all<br/>\nplayers.  You are mistaking that for competition.  Because I&#39;m<br/>\ntaking into consideration the other guy&#39;s enjoyment of the<br/>\ngame, you are mistakenly thinking I&#39;m worrying about him to<br/>\ncompete with him (or he with me).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, you are looking at this as a competition. So what if it&#39;s crowded? I<br/>\n&gt; hunt what I can, when I can - if someone else gets it, oh well. Mobs are<br/>\n&gt; good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>\n&gt; area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>\n&gt; somewhere else to hunt.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is self-contradictory.  On the one hand, you say &quot;so what<br/>\nif it&#39;s crowded?&quot;  On the other you say if it&#39;s too crowded,<br/>\nyou just logout.  If your attitude towards it is &quot;so what,&quot;<br/>\nthen why do you logout?  You are trying to claim this isn&#39;t a<br/>\nproblem, when your actions clearly indicate you feel it can<br/>\nbe enough of a problem for you not to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I regularly visit areas that are WAY under my level. I also regularly save<br/>\n&gt; low level players from trains or certain death - I ENJOY doing that. Is my<br/>\n&gt; presence depriving them of the joy of death? Do you think my presence there<br/>\n&gt; is resented? If it is, I&#39;ve never heard anyone remark on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:)  I enjoy doing that too.  But I hardly think we&#39;re<br/>\nrepresentative of the majority of the playerbase.  EQ is a<br/>\ngame about killing mobs, and that&#39;s what most players do.  The<br/>\nbenefit or harm due to a change in the game has to be judged<br/>\nbased primarily on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you let what another has affect YOUR enjoyment - that is a problem of<br/>\n&gt; yours you need to address. Does your neighbor having a nicer car than you<br/>\n&gt; bother you? A bigger house? A better income? Does it really affect you<br/>\n&gt; adversely?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re still missing my point - that direct and indirect<br/>\ninteractions are unavoidable and affect the overall enjoyment<br/>\nof the game by the playerbase.  You pretend that it is an<br/>\ninternal problem, or that it&#39;s too small to matter (&quot;affect<br/>\nyou adversely).  Like I said, I&#39;m thinking based on the sum of<br/>\nthe enjoyment of all players.  Something that a significant<br/>\nnumber of players (who may or may not think like you) perceive<br/>\n(internally) to be a problem, IS a problem.  Something that an<br/>\nindividual player may not perceive to be an adverse problem,<br/>\nmay in fact be an adverse problem with the game as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
