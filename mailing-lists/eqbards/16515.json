We had 47 war, 48<br/>\nbard, 50 clr, 50 sha, 48 clr, 49 mnk.  Over-kill, I guess.  The druid we<br/>\nwere sharing the spawn with (play nice ;p) suggested we try the Dark<br/>\nAssassin since we heard shouts across the zone about his location.  Since I<br/>\nwas the only one with tracking, I took off to find him...<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly tells the group, &quot;so what is he?&quot;<br/>\nAtaras tells the group, &quot;level 50 rogue and lots of hit points&quot;<br/>\nSylly tells the group, &quot;ugh, backstabs&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I find him and cast chain. He resists and chases me.  I let him get<br/>\nclose enough for one round and although I missed the scroll, I was down 2+<br/>\nbubs in a flash.  I Selos back to the group and got a heal. Then back to<br/>\nfind him again.  This time I was real carefull to selos pull him. Run -<br/>\nlook - run - look keeping him well outside of melee but still within agro.<br/>\nWe took him down in a long fight.  Chain/Fear is what I used and it worked -<br/>\nie very few resists.  He was malosi as well so maybe that helps?  Malosi<br/>\nlowers his magic resists?  He dropped a combine dagger and Bloody Dirk:<br/>\nDamage 6, Delay 22.  +3 str, +3 dex.  Wt. 1.  Effect of Disease Cloud.<br/>\nmagic, lore item.  Rogue only.  Heh, combine dagger was rather prophetic<br/>\nbecause that is what happened to it later in the evening - someone clicked<br/>\ncombine instead of done.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, you are not level 47-50 but here is a tip (for those 35 and up ;p).  I<br/>\nused tracking to find him - straight forward enough.  Then used tracking to<br/>\nfind my group.  I keep tracking on a hot key pallette and open the box and<br/>\njust click track.  The first track item is one of your party members and<br/>\npre-selected.  I can get a heading back to my group with an angry mob<br/>\nchasing me quickly and easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chains for pulling?  Depends on the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From my days in Sol A, we<br/>\n&gt; learned quickly that you don&#39;t want to be SoW&#39;ed when pulling and you WANT<br/>\n&gt; that mob stuck on your back... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
