To bring this a bit back to the theme of the list,<br/>\n&gt; has anyone else noted that even though the chant scrolls say they are<br/>\n&gt; percussion, playing a drum doesnt appear to make a darn bit of<br/>\n&gt; difference? I tested chant of flame and chant of ice on myself with my<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore drum and playing a drum makes no difference either in the<br/>\n&gt; damage taken or the amount of resistance lowered.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
