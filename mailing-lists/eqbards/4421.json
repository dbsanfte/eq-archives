Last weekend my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1421106608\">Roop,<br/>\nI had the almost exact same thing happen to me the other day on Bristlebane.<br/>\nListen to this and I swear you will pee all over yourself.<br/>\nLast weekend my cleric friend and I were in EK doing the lion/crawler/hound<br/>\nshuffle when towards the end of the fight with one of these critters my<br/>\ncleric friend healed himself and we hear someone shout CHEATER!<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, I just ignore shouts as spam and go about business as usual.<br/>\nhowever, looking around I noticed the source of the shout was staring<br/>\ndirectly at my cleric friend and said *Cheater* again. We&#39;re all, WTF? This<br/>\nguy con&#39;d  Red as Lenin to me so, at first I was taken aback and wondered<br/>\njust what he was talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes? we ask him. Just how and what are we doing to cheat?<br/>\nI was dumbfounded.<br/>\nThe guy says, You cast heal on yourself!<br/>\n&lt;blinks&gt;<br/>\nWTF you talking about, man?<br/>\nThe guy says, That is IMPOSSIBLE! I am a level 30 cleric and can&#39;t cast<br/>\nspells in combat! You CHEATED. I get interrupted all the time so it is<br/>\nIMPOSSIBLE.<br/>\n&lt;blinks again&gt;<br/>\nChanneling, we say.<br/>\nCHANNELING? What is Channeling? he asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a long story short, suffice it to say Mr. Level 30 Cleric had never<br/>\nheard of Channeling and had about a gazzillion practice points saved up for<br/>\nthat *Special Training* he apparently dreamed of spending them on.  He has<br/>\nnever spent a practice point in his life.<br/>\nJESUS H CHRIST! Can you imagine his down time for meditating?<br/>\nYes, we did school him on training points and channeling/interruptions.  But<br/>\nbeing the * fu**ing bitch *  (his own words) that I am, made a complete fool<br/>\nout of him in the process.  I usually dont do that sort of thing because I<br/>\nhate to be at the recieving end of someones ridicule as much as the next<br/>\nguy, but CRIMINY! Level 30! And to boot he was being a total ass to us, and<br/>\ncalled us Cheaters. If he would have been nice and asked how we were doing<br/>\nsuch a WONDOROUS THING as being able to cast spells in combat, I would have<br/>\nnot made him feel so small.<br/>\n<br/>\nM Steele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;singing hymn.  I sauntered over and said, &quot;You know, that song would be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;more effective with an instrument.&quot;  He replied, &quot;Ya, but I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt;carrying all that stuff.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Carrying all that stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;A bard who doesn&#39;t like carrying instruments???&quot;  And he just said, &quot;Yup.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;But a mandolin weighs absolutely nothing!  But the songs are much more<br/>\n&gt;effective when played, singing them is like like like....  I couldn&#39;t say </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
