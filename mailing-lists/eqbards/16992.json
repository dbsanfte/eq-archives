I think these events<br/>\ncause a reappraisal of what buffs you currently have on, and<br/>\nthe spdata.eff file lists song effects without instruments.  <br/>\nSo when your buffs are reappraised, the song effects get set<br/>\nback to non-instrument values (need to test this with a buff<br/>\nsong).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s usually not a problem because our songs refresh so<br/>\nquickly.
