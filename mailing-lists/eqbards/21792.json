Each level of a bard should be considered when <br/>\nmaking an evaluation. I remember groups loving my level 10 bard and how <br/>\nlittle downtime the group experienced with Hymn. That&#39;s probably the best <br/>\nthing I feel about bards is their ability to reduce downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I agree with Kitasi about bards being totally nerfed to the point <br/>\nof ineffectiveness. Verant has stated that the Bard&#39;s mezmerize will never <br/>\nbe as effective as an enchanters.  As a matter of fact, at level 40 in City <br/>\nof Mist, I can really only effectively reduce the number of mobs attacking <br/>\nmy group by 1 (with charm) and have him attack a mob that is currently <br/>\nbeing engaged by my group. Unlike an enchanter, who would be able to <br/>\neffectively mez 2 or 3 of them. It does seem that the higher level up a <br/>\nbard goes, the less effective a crowd controller they become.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have a lot of fun with my 40 bard. I still am mostly in pickup <br/>\ngroups (part time bard who only plays at most 3 hours) and those groups all <br/>\nlove having me. Most don&#39;t realize I can charm and help with crowd control <br/>\n(of course they all know about clarity). I did some pulling (lament still <br/>\nworks nicely), some charming mobs off of our healer, and then battle <br/>\nbuffing. When there&#39;s not an enchanter around, the tanks all pray for my <br/>\nCelerity to speed their attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, after I told my enchanter friend about how lousy bard mez is, he <br/>\nmentioned that they should at least give bards a way to slow down the mobs <br/>\nattack. I laughed and said that we get both target and AOE slow down songs. <br/>\nI haven&#39;t sung Largo&#39;s in a long time, due to aggro problems. But I may <br/>\nthrow that in the mix and see how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you really wanted to play a character that is the best of class <br/>\nin what they do, then a bard is not for you. Bards are versatile and can <br/>\nhelp every group they join. I find I have to tell my groups what I&#39;m doing <br/>\nfor them to give them a better appreciation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I really thank those who posted some of their various &quot;macros&quot; for <br/>\nweaving. I&#39;ve found that the one for &quot;Hymn and Clarity&quot; weaving for <br/>\ndowntime is great. My weary fingers thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:27 AM 10/11/00 -0700, Jeffrey Sue wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;heh, the bard&#39;s flexibility only increases up to about level 52.  once you <br/>\n&gt;start fighting<br/>\n&gt;52+ mobs, you lose the ability to crowd control with charm.  so you made <br/>\n&gt;it all the<br/>\n&gt;way to 31 and make sweeping generalizations about the flexibility and <br/>\n&gt;effectiveness<br/>\n&gt;of a bard?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 09:57 AM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think the &#39;at some point&#39; means when they are working on EQ2.
