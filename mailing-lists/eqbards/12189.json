You can be fighting in the<br/>\nroom just fine and - whammo a train arrives.  You can blow a spawn time (or<br/>\nsimply not keep time) pull the GIBS and now 5 bad skellies and a couple<br/>\nfroggies - ugh. <br/>\n<br/>\n(switching zones here to Sol-B)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonic bats are bad yes but in your upper 30&#39;s/low 40&#39;s you will meet them<br/>\nwhen you go to Sol-B.  We had 3 40&#39;s bard cleric ranger, a 42 druid, a 44<br/>\npal and a 36 war.  We camped the Nobel room.  Our 36 war (lev 50&#39;s twink)<br/>\ndecides to pull from the bat room.  Ok doing good for a couple pulls -<br/>\nsonics are blue to me at 40.  Then the pull from Hell.  3 sonics and a fire<br/>\nbeetle (? - not lava duct crawler but the weaker bug)!!  So, I go into mez<br/>\n(pixie striking) mode and elemental for MR and we fight them. One by one we<br/>\ntake em down.  Just as we get the last one - the room spawns and after the<br/>\nfirst greater kobold we get a soluesk kobold.  Turns out to be a non-stop 6<br/>\nkill fight.  Ugh - everyone is OOM, Pal used LoH (lay on hands) on someone,<br/>\nwe are all less than half hp in the end. Yeesh.  Damn glad I carry jasper<br/>\nand bloodstones now!  Gave a stack to the cleric and asked him to buff _all_<br/>\nof us. (Yes, Harm - the cleric was Bate, the Pal was Adluh and the 36 war<br/>\nwas - yup yup you guessed it Sense (Sensorama&#39;s twink) ;p)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are level 40??? Hehe - woo hoo you made my day!!   Sylly is level 40 too<br/>\nand hehe caught ya!  (Well ok you are still ahead but that&#39;s pretty scary<br/>\nno?)  Hell - yes - xp is slow unless you get a good group and go to good<br/>\nspots.  Greater Kobs in full party&#39;s are not good xp.  GK&#39;s with a higher<br/>\nlevel partner (me and a 46 druid and some times just 1 other tank type) do a<br/>\nlot better.  And I was in the second bat room with a full group and all but<br/>\none 36 pal were co or higher all the way to 47&#39;s - and we fought there and I<br/>\ngot one-half bub in 2 to 3 hours.  Lots better than the Nobel camp and<br/>\nseemed safer - although they kept talking about something called &quot;the nox&quot; -<br/>\nbut these were some very good players - not a &#39;pick-up&#39; group by any means.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, December 27, 1999 12:28 PM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re: Re: Grrrrrrrr!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 27 Dec 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [ Pulling GIBs ]<br/>\n&gt; We did this 3 times.
