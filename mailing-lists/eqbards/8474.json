The zone is huge, and well suited to staying out of<br/>\ntheir melee range with Accelerando.  The tricky part is<br/>\ncharming the winner.  I charmed Choon, and when he dropped to<br/>\nabout 5% hp, I switched to Froon who was still at about 30%.<br/>\nWell, Choon put up quite a fight, and Froon finally won with<br/>\nabout 2% hp remaining.  Oh well, at least that made him pretty<br/>\neasy to chain/fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be sure you know where the ogre camp is and stay away.<br/>\nChief Goonda seems to have a huge aggro radius (so do Choon<br/>\nand Froon for that matter).  Goonda moves at SoC speed, and<br/>\nwas able to slowly catch up to me (L36 with a mistmore drum)*.<br/>\nI had to Chain him to lose him, which was a problem because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have him targeted.  When I switched to an external view<br/>\nso I could target him behind me, I ran into a tree and he got<br/>\na couple hits for 80+ on me.  Yow!<br/>\n<br/>\n* I think SoC is just 2.0x normal running speed.  I&#39;m<br/>\ncurrently slightly faster than 2.0x normal running speed with<br/>\nmy MM drum.  But I&#39;ve noticed while playing my other<br/>\ncharacters that NPCs can slowly catch up to me, probably due<br/>\nto lag or some &quot;fix&quot; on Verant&#39;s part to assure NPCs chasing<br/>\nyou can always keep up with you.  So SoC on an NPC is slightly<br/>\nfaster than 2.0x normal running speed for a PC.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
