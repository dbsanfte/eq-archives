I know summoning water <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t such a big<br/>\n&gt; deal, but my evil friends are sometimes out or nearly out of <br/>\n&gt; food and water<br/>\n&gt; when I hook up with them. Being a baker, I usually have food <br/>\n&gt; I can give them,<br/>\n&gt; but being able to summon water for them would sure be nice. <br/>\n&gt; Does the water<br/>\n&gt; poof when you log like mage summoned water?
