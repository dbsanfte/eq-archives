We<br/>\nspeculated this could be the evil races dock to the new land, much like the<br/>\nSouth Ro dock. I haven&#39;t been to North Ro myself to confirm.<br/>\n<br/>\n I bought the 49th song in Erudin and used it this weekend. We were in Hate<br/>\nand CoM with another guild so no definitive results. We couldn&#39;t tell if we<br/>\nhealed less. The song does have some taunt factor, I noticed some mobs would<br/>\nwhack me at least once when it cycled, but not every time. The Concert Hall<br/>\nhas a list of Velious songs, it included the new 49th song proir to it&#39;s<br/>\nintroduction so probably have to take that list as a possibles list for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
