He spawned on the first floor.<br/>\nHere is the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI as a 19th Human Bard, was in a party with one 20th lvl Paladin, a 23rd<br/>\nlevel Bard named Elsin (great guy) and three other mid - low twenties<br/>\ncharacters.  It was my turn to pull, so I was using my newly aquired<br/>\ninvisibility, ( I find it works on most blue undead ).  I stepped into the<br/>\nBuilding from the left side patio door, and just inside I saw the Lesser<br/>\nBlade Fiend.  It consisded of about a dozen various weapons/shields swirling<br/>\nin a tornado-like fashion.  I looked at it for a bit, it /con&#39;d high blue to<br/>\nme at 19th.  I diddn&#39;t look like it was pulled to this spot, it looked like<br/>\nit spawned there, (it was standing where spawns normaly apprear).  I stood<br/>\nthere in awe for a bit telling my party what I had found, they started<br/>\ntelling Get It.. Get It.. so I did.  We killed it quickly, and when it died<br/>\nall of the weapons and shields fell to the ground.  As the lowest member of<br/>\nthe party I was getting the usual slim pickins, but no one wanted the<br/>\nPugius.  It is now an excellent addition to my Dragoon Dirk.  I feel like a<br/>\nblender...:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 19th Level Human Bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 10:33 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Mysterious Weapon (semi-spoiler)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMonths ago I bought the Pugius Dagger to dual wield with my dragoon dirk<br/>\nsince the delay was so low and it works vs magic only monsters.  I was a<br/>\nshish-kebob machine doing 10 damage with Pugius and 12 damage with Dragoon<br/>\nDirk for as much as 22 straight melee damage about every 2.2 seconds.  The<br/>\nSilvery War Axe that fetches 400pp on the PC market has an attack delay of<br/>\n22 and damage 6 vs the Pugius&#39; delay 21 damage 5 and they weigh the same.<br/>\nThe Bladed Thulian Claws have an attack delay of 19 and damage of 5.  Pugius<br/>\nis an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>\nwith piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is this weapon found?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>\nUnrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>\ntold they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I see<br/>\nanyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?
