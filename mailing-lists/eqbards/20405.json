The first is along with<br/>\n&gt; chains--you chain/fear/chain/fear (rinse repeat) while you and/or your<br/>\n&gt; party cast and hack at its back.  This only really works in wide-open<br/>\n&gt; places, obviously.  The second is as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  When<br/>\n&gt; you get stuck in a really bad situation (say you are in a dungeon and no<br/>\n&gt; one can get the mobs off the druid/wizzie long enough for them to cast<br/>\n&gt; evac), you sing fear, the mobs go flying away, and you have just enough<br/>\n&gt; time to affect your escape. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
