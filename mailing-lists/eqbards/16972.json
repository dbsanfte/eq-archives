I got one that<br/>\nI use in the Planes.  I can stand in the melee and not worry about getting<br/>\nexcessive attention.  With 6 Note and Yk, I would draw attention and take<br/>\ndamage.  Then I went to 6NB and Dragoon Dirk.  Then I got the Shimmering Orb<br/>\nand enjoy the ac boost and can pretty much melee the whole time. My personal<br/>\nopinion is that my greatest value to my group and our team is my delivery of<br/>\nmana.  If i die, it&#39;s a big waste of time and mana and adds to instead of<br/>\nreducing the down time.  Plus I am totally sick of dying.  Sure 49/50 res<br/>\ngets you 80-90% xp back but 4 deaths with exp res&#39;s is still over half a bub<br/>\nand at 48 thats *hours* of boring camping blues.  So my focus is on survial,<br/>\nmana delivery and what ever additional buffs or resists are required.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Taunt on the orb is huge, and it goes off a lot.
