Otherwise,<br/>\n&gt;   you aren&#39;t gonna get anything else out of the game.  I&#39;m having great<br/>\n&gt;   fun doing dragon planning and raiding planes.  After you make L50,<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, and you can<br/>\n&gt;   enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>\n&gt;   often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>\n&gt;   you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t stress going on one as soon as you get invited. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not the final destination I&#39;m in it for, I want to have fun getting there.  And<br/>\ndragon raids are FUN!  I went on my first around the beginning of 45.  I&#39;m<br/>\nstill working my way through 45 &lt;sigh&gt;, and got to help kill Naggy last night.<br/>\nAt the last Vox raid, I got *incredibly* lucky and won the roll on a Runed<br/>\nBolster Belt.  I&#39;ve made a bunch of 50 friends.  (And okay, a few enemies<br/>\nsince I won that belt. :) )  Right now I consider myself a junior member of the<br/>\ndragon run teams.  I do exactly what people tell me, watch and learn, and<br/>\nhope I don&#39;t get hit by much.  Once its over, I go back and kill kobolds for a<br/>\nwhile and work on leveling for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess theres two ways you can do it.  You can look at leveling as a chore you<br/>\nhave to go through to win the magic bullet that is level 50, slogging through<br/>\nkobold after kobold, bug after bug, or you can do your best to make leveling<br/>\nfun and interesting by breaking it up with lots of non-leveling activities  such<br/>\nas dragon runs, romances, newbie helping, or whatever...  I know which way<br/>\nI&#39;m doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin, 45th bard of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
