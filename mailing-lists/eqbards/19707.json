[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 13, 2000 8:54 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] A possible way to make Disarm Traps useful?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted this idea to the gameplay boards, what do you fellow bards think<br/>\nwould something like this be work?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like the idea of making Disarm Traps a skill that actually does<br/>\nsomething hit the link below and add your ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nDisarm Traps, the bane of EQ programmers?<br/>\nHere&#39;s an idea on how to make a viable use of the skill without changing the<br/>\nbasic nature of the world. True it doesn&#39;t involve interaction with the game<br/>\nenvironment, but I thought that was the problem anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is fairly simple. Start off by making an item called An Ornate Box.<br/>\nIf you examine it it appears to be a container with 4 slots that weighs 5.0<br/>\nlbs. If you click on it to open it however instead of opening it casts a<br/>\nspell like a magic item. The spell is cast on the holder of the item and<br/>\ncould be a poison DoT, a lightning DD, or whatever trap you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe change to Disarm traps would be to allow the item to make a check on<br/>\nDisarm Traps when attempting to open it. If the skill check is a success<br/>\nthen the trapped chest is replaced with a different item that represents the<br/>\ntreasure inside, much in the fashion of the Combine button changing the item<br/>\ncombined into a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be a feasible solution to making Disarm Traps useful, and would<br/>\nno doubt greatly increase the call for rogues since only they and high level<br/>\nbards could open these mysterious treasure boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051630.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051630.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
