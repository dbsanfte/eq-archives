If they would fix our broken or useless songs we would be fine.  Most<br/>\n&gt;of the weakness I perceive in the bard class is not because of Verant&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;vision of a bard.  It is mostly because Verant has made melee classes so<br/>\n&gt;much less common than casting ones through some of their decisions.  EQ is<br/>\n&gt;definitely a caster&#39;s game powerwise.  Melee characters might get all the<br/>\n&gt;neat toys, but caster&#39;s get all the things that make playing easier.  If I<br/>\n&gt;played with less casual players maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue.<br/>\n&gt;Every time I get in a melee heavy group we have a great time and I can<br/>\n&gt;contribut enormously.  In a caster heavy group all the weaknesses of the<br/>\n&gt;bard class come to the forefront, and if there&#39;s an enchanter present I feel<br/>\n&gt;pretty useless.  Unfortunately caster heavy groups seem to outnumber tank<br/>\n&gt;heavy ones by about 5-1 at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ahh, we are pretty much a god class with the way that songs work currently, but<br/>\nshhh, don&#39;t tell anybody.  it just depends if you are willing to play within the framework<br/>\nthat is provided, and be a little creative on how you deal with different situations.  that&#39;s<br/>\nwhy i like my bard, there&#39;s a lot of problem solving with a lot of different tools (hey, i&#39;m<br/>\nan engineer, heh), and that&#39;s a lot of fun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;         Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/451022/_/962294548/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/451022/_/962294548/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
