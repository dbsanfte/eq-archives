It was certainly not a shark. Yet when I swam to where it was, there<br/>\n&gt;was nothing there (I was to dumb or dumbfounded to /con it).

While I have yet to go all &quot;Ahab&quot; and devote my life to hunting one<br/>\n&gt;down, it is nice to hear I am not alone in this rare sighting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, has anyone ever swam to the bottom of the lake in West Commonlands? I<br/>\n&gt;swam to the bottom and was teleported to the zone wall it shares with East<br/>\n&gt;Commonlands. The text sayed that I was being moved to a safe place or<br/>\n&gt;something like that. It has happened repeatedly and I swear that I saw<br/>\n&gt;something down there too, though, alas I do not recall the /loc of the<br/>\n&gt;object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This list is a wonderful source of information, but it took another mermaid<br/>\n&gt;sighting to get me to leave Lurkerville.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cleaver<br/>\n&gt;Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right under the docks in Qeynos, there is a square opening, if<br/>\nyou swim down into it, you are teleported to the inland end of<br/>\nthe dock.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
