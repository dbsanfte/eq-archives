Well, last<br/>\nnight in Mistmoore this did not appear to be the case.<br/>\n I was running around when I was rooted by<br/>\nsomething--maybe dark offerer or whatever.  Anyway<br/>\nSelo&#39;s was on and did NOT break root.  It is possible<br/>\nthat I got rooted and stunned which killed my song<br/>\nbefore the next pulse.  I got out of the root and was<br/>\nblasted about 2 jumps from the zone. Arghhh.  Anyway,<br/>\ncan anyone verify the root thing?  I&#39;ll try to<br/>\nexperiment with a rooter tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
