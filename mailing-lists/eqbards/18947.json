I&#39;m currently level 14 and<br/>\nhave been thinking heavily of travelling to Kunark.  At the moment, my<br/>\ndruid hubby and I are taking a whirlwind tour of Antonica to gather my<br/>\nupcoming songs (up to level 18) and to have a taste of what the<br/>\ncontinent has to offer before taking the long boat ride.  We fought in<br/>\nN. Karana the last couple of days, and will probably go visit<br/>\nLavastorm next.  We fought plenty of caimans in the Oasis at level 12,<br/>\nso will probably not visit there this time around.  Our plans in<br/>\nKunark are to travel to the Fields of Bone.  I just hope we survive<br/>\nthe run getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaladen, as I am also on Luclin, send me a tell.  Who knows, maybe we<br/>\ncan venture into Kunark together?<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Wood Elf Bard of 14 songs<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
