The up side it seems is that 45 max is for sung, some people<br/>\n&gt; are getting upwards of 95 rune per 3 second pulse (with <br/>\n&gt; K-lute). What I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t understand is why people think it&#39;s crap. *boggle* It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stack with Niv&#39;s, is this really such a problem? It&#39;s all defense,<br/>\n&gt; Niv&#39;s is balance, there&#39;s a time and place for all things. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thinking about Cantata strategies (not that I&#39;ll break 51 <br/>\n&gt; much less get<br/>\n&gt; that high), does Hymn stack with Cantata? If so then Cantata + Hymn +<br/>\n&gt; Shielding sounds like a damn fine backup healer position. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just playing my bard wrong *shrug*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ninev Rudeflute<br/>\n&gt; 47th Chorus of Karana<br/>\n&gt; Lore Keepers - E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
