For this reason, bards are the best class <br/>\nfor saving newbies from trains.  And yes, it is also very good for twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby can be very useful if you have a rogue and healer in your group and <br/>\nfighting multiple mobs.  While you sleep the rest of the mobs, the rogue can <br/>\nbackstab the one you are fighting and the cleric can heal you.  But I <br/>\nusually don&#39;t use lullaby unless there is a healer in the group and everyone <br/>\nin the group knows what the ASSIST command is for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes I know that.  What I was wondering was if someone has<br/>\n&gt;fought a mob past half dead (at which point it would normally<br/>\n&gt;be almost impossible to pull the mob off him), can you fire up<br/>\n&gt;the song and mob will now attack the bard or the next person<br/>\n&gt;to attack him?  That&#39;s what I was trying to figure out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nevertheless, even if this effect exists, hatred for the bard<br/>\n&gt;seems to be excepted (stuff you put to sleep for a long time<br/>\n&gt;will attack you until they die even though someone else is<br/>\n&gt;killing it), which kinda makes it useless except for a<br/>\n&gt;twinking exploit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
