I can think<br/>\nof a hundred retorts - but it&#39;s not appropriate here...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the ballots - a poorly defined user-interface is a poorly designed<br/>\nuser interface.  The intelligence or educational level of the user isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to compensate for that.  We have the same type in here in Cook<br/>\nCounty - as the Republicans point out - BUT for everything except judicial<br/>\nretention - you never go left-right-left-right - all the candidates for an<br/>\noffice are on one side of the ballot - and the opposite side is blank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI AM college educated - and voted many times - and when I got to the<br/>\njudicial part (which has options on both side) - it IS very confusing - and<br/>\nI realized I screwed it up.  But I figured &quot;It&#39;s just judges - most people<br/>\ndon&#39;t vote on those - who cares&quot;.  And it didn&#39;t matter - to remove a judge<br/>\nit requires 60 percent of the voters to vote no - and not a single has lost<br/>\ntheir job in many many years (great system there)...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat ballot in Palm Beach Florida was very poorly designed.  I guess that<br/>\nguy can always get a job working for Verant...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Joanna Wright [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Centiera@...\">Centiera@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 12, 2000 7:04 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Test Problem fixed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe, the real irony here is the same type of ballot<br/>\ncard is used in Al Gore&#39;s home county.
