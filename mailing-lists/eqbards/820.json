It only cost me about 300 plat total<br/>\nfor the full set.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the additional Armor Class rating, I believe platemail absorbs<br/>\ndamage from more kinds of attacks, and absorbs it better. (See other post).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want some easy loot in a safe dungeon, go to Paw. At level 18 you<br/>\ncan solo the whole place, but still get exp from captains, commanders, and<br/>\nthe high shamans. Snakeskin armor and the sought after runed totem staff<br/>\nare your rewards. I bring back 100 plat worth of loot on every trip. And on<br/>\nFenin Ro the zone goes neglected. I have never seen it with more than 20<br/>\npeople, and very often I am the only one there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:45 AM 5/17/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MIKE.J.MOTT@...\">MIKE.J.MOTT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>\n&gt;level.
