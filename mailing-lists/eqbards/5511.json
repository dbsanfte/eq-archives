And apparently learned the<br/>\nsecret to getting him to spawn (spoiler below).

If you talk to him,<br/>\nthen ask about his kind - Trumpy appears almost<br/>\ninstantaneously in the bar (assuming he&#39;s not already<br/>\nwalking around somewhere). From what I was able to<br/>\ntell, 3 times and then you&#39;re KOS in the bar by<br/>\nTrumpy&#39;s buddies - which isn&#39;t a big deal, except<br/>\nthat the bouncer comes after you for causing trouble<br/>\nin the bar.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
