I have tried clearing the skelly<br/>\n  &gt; camp in SK in an effort to get him to spawn but no luck.  Does he only spwan<br/>\n  &gt; if the quest is initiated?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I killed Lord Grimrot in a group of three L35s (the badass Grim, not<br/>\n    the weaker one... two spawned, L25 and L35)  The L35 Grimrot carrys<br/>\n    a no-drop scythe that procs something (usable, but for a quest).  I<br/>\n    heard the rumor of the quest connected to him and Mistmoore, I never<br/>\n    followed up on it.  He has since been removed from the game.  I&#39;ve not<br/>\n    seen him since I was in my L30s.  Either he got really, really rare<br/>\n    and no one has cleaned the camp long enough or he&#39;s poofed.  My guess<br/>\n    is the latter.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
