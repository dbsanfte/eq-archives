Running all the way across West Karana has<br/>\nalways taken about a bubble of stamina, and still does (as of<br/>\nabout 2 weeks ago).  It just takes less time for me to cross<br/>\nthe distance now, so you lose stamina faster over time, but<br/>\nit&#39;s the same stamina drain for the distance covered.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
