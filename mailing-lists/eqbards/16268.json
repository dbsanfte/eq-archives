We have a cleric in our guild that we always count as a 1/2<br/>\nwarrior + 1/2 wizard when deciding if our group is balanced.  He once sent a<br/>\nscreenshot to the guild-list from an adventure where several people died do<br/>\nto lack of healing and wondered how with two clerics that happened.  The<br/>\nanswer presented by his screen was very telling, at level 15 he had only 7<br/>\nspells memorized, 1 heal, 3 summoning, 2 DD, and gate.  Needless to say we<br/>\nwere in shock.  In the middle of a romp thru Najena, this guy has summon<br/>\nfood, summon water, and that Hammer spell memm&#39;d.  What a maroon.  His name<br/>\nappropriately is Banestrike.  We have trained him to be a bit better, but<br/>\nhe&#39;s still not really a cleric and we never count on him as such.  It<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t surprise me one bit if he is specialized in evocation.  He&#39;s the<br/>\nonly cleric I know who though Befallen was way too tough a dungeon.  Of<br/>\ncourse since he was using his generic DD&#39;s instead of his undead specific<br/>\nones (which he hadn&#39;t bought yet) I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2000 10:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] re: Class Balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Mar 16/00, Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMusson@...\">CMusson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Example of agressively stupid:<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in my early 20&#39;s I met a cleric in Mistmoore who told the group he<br/>\nplanned to specialize in evocation and had chosen a cleric because<br/>\nWizards couldn&#39;t wear enough armor.
