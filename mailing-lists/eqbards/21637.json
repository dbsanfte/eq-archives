Taking that into consideration, they also have backed off<br/>\nthat stance somewhat since using a gamepad to twist songs (and it is NOT<br/>\nreliable in a battle due to missed notes, lag etc.) can offer relief to<br/>\nsomeone who is suffering from a physical disability, a repetitive stress<br/>\ncondition etc..  I think the best guideline to go by is to NEVER leave your<br/>\ngamepad alone with a repetive &quot;macro&quot; going when you are not at the<br/>\nkeyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally use a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, which has software that allows<br/>\nyou to program in extremely long series of keystrokes (my heal&#92;mana sequence<br/>\nlasts 10 minutes and my levitate&#92;selos sequence lasts 20 minutes).  Other<br/>\ngamepads allow programming keystrokes and also have an auto-fire button,<br/>\nwhich would be better suited to this application.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big thing about using a gamepad to twist is you have to stop it from<br/>\ntwisting to say anything. Also if you are using it for travel, and you miss<br/>\na couple notes in a row trying to play levitation, well lets just say its<br/>\nnot the fall that kills you - its the sudden stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertoxxulous, Bard of the 37th Composition, Defenders of<br/>\nAleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
