I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>\nrelease server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes, we<br/>\nhave a lot of button pushing to do.

IE:  We have to know exactly what to have memorised in<br/>\nany given situation to reach peak effectiveness.  All other classes, for the<br/>\nmost part, have to memorise basically one set of spells with a small<br/>\n&quot;alternative&quot; subset.  Bard song lists change on a area, group makeup, group<br/>\nsize basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are harder but we don&#39;t push any more buttons nor are our jobs any<br/>\nmore difficult (and in some cases our jobs are downright easy) than other<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Big Daddy Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 11:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] getting new friends<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They hit a single button ever few rounds, we double hit buttons ever 3<br/>\n&gt; seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is a HUGE difference (my tertiary character is a monk).
