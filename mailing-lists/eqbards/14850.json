My bard was fun to play up to L39.  After that the songs became less useful, and poorly designed.

Bards are designed to be very valuable party members (and less so as a<br/>\n&gt; powerful solo class.) So, the more fun you can have with people and partys,<br/>\n&gt; the more you will enjoy your bard.  But it will take alot of time and an<br/>\n&gt; enormous amount of dedication. And you will die, alot!  Hehe, so dont get<br/>\n&gt; discouraged and dont pay too much attention to the problems of other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  My bard was fun to play up to L39.  After that the songs became less<br/>\n  useful, and poorly designed.  Level 39 was also the level when you<br/>\n  miss your first song, simply because they haven&#39;t created it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not going to sugar coat it like Sylly did, because that&#39;s not<br/>\n  how this game works.  The bard is incomplete, poorly tested, and<br/>\n  very difficult to play in all situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Regardless of the lack of solo ability, your contribution will diminish<br/>\n  as your level increases past L35.  You can roleplay and party all you<br/>\n  want, but you can do that with any class or any character.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you don&#39;t pay attention to &#39;problems&#39; of other people then you<br/>\n  will not get sound advice on what it&#39;s like to be a bard.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n  play any other character except my bard.  My druid twink is something<br/>\n  I toy around with but don&#39;t take seriously.  I want Verant to make<br/>\n  the bard more key to groups by giving them songs that exceed the <br/>\n  use of purely mana or purely speed.  I love my bard, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n  play any other class if I had to start over.  But if you choose<br/>\n  this road, it&#39;s long and very frustrating.  Regardless of whether<br/>\n  you die a lot, you&#39;ll find as you begin to level is your songs <br/>\n  don&#39;t really make you any more popular or necessary.  Our songs<br/>\n  have a niche, but are easily outlived and surpassed by other <br/>\n  spells from casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There may be a few naive bards out there who think they are gods<br/>\n  at L50, or that they are perfect, but the high level bard is far<br/>\n  from perfect.  I&#39;m not alone, other people share this opinion:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love my bard, I&#39;m just confused and frustrating because my focus<br/>\n  and scope drastically decreases over time.  My usefulness is limited<br/>\n  and my songs/skills are often plagued by side effects and bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
