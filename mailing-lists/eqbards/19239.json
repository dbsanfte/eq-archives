I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>\nmodem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.  On about<br/>\nhalf those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>\ndisconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\nshowed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>\nseen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>\nat work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>\nsources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>\ngame was totally unplayable last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n\tSomewhere in Warsliks Woods, only wish I knew where<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The servers were down for an emergency patch today.<br/>\n&gt;Coincidence?

Last night was the first time in four<br/>\nmonths that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>\nbefore I had to reboot my computer.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
