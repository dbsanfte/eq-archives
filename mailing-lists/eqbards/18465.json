I was dropping Blues fast, mixing in a<br/>\n&gt; fear chain every so often... Then, yesterday I was switching from my<br/>\n&gt; lute, had the pointer over it and the Drum went &quot;Poof&quot; !!!<br/>\n&gt;   I backed up and searched the ground in a panic. Nothing there !!! I<br/>\n&gt; petitioned and when the guide finally showed up her attitude<br/>\n&gt; initially was &quot;Tough Toenails&quot;.. I finally talked her into reporting<br/>\n&gt; it to Verant as a possible Bug and if they review my log I MAY or may<br/>\n&gt; not get a replacement. Moonflower is Disconsolate.. I love that drum.<br/>\n&gt;  Now the question is... at level 42, what are the chances of getting<br/>\n&gt; a Drum of Selos March as a replacement ?  ..rare drop off Nagafen ?<br/>\n&gt; Any tips ?<br/>\n&gt;       I appreciate any advice you guys can give me,<br/>\n&gt;       Moonflower Bllue, 42 Bard<br/>\n&gt;       Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Bids starting at $7 for thousands of products - uBid.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3027/10/_/451022/_/957991686/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3027/10/_/451022/_/957991686/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
