I<br/>\ngot together a good group and went in to get my two bard quest items.<br/>\nWe headed for the king room, and managed to break the spawn (thank you<br/>\nLament).  We camped the room for about 4 hours.  Almost everyone in the<br/>\ngroup had some quest item they wanted, and I was the only bard.  Well,<br/>\nto make a long story short, after killing at least 25 solusek champions,<br/>\n5 sol mages, 6 sol shamans, 25ish inferno goblins.  Not a single one of<br/>\nus got a quest item.  Are these supposed to be that rare?  Are we just<br/>\nin the wrong place to find these items or what?  We got a couple<br/>\nmediocre items off the king, but I didn&#39;t get any of them (lost the<br/>\nroll).  To add insult to injury, just as I was saying I needed to go (I<br/>\nhad already stayed up 2 hours late), we had a bad pull, and half of us<br/>\ndied.  And I awoke to......Greater Feydark.  Heh... Oops.  Thank god for<br/>\nrevive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight?  Did they nerf it with the latest patch or something?  Or<br/>\nhas it always been this rare for them to drop the quest items?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrustrated,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, Level 29 bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSteven S.
