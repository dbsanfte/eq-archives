And I posted a reply on the Sony board.  And<br/>\nI<br/>\ntried not to whine TOO much.  But I sure do hate killing my friends :(.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love playing my bard.  I have played her almost exclusively for the last<br/>\n18<br/>\nmonths and I still have a lot of fun.  The bard class suits me and I have<br/>\nhad<br/>\nsome amazing times when everything went right and I saved my group.  But<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\ngetting harder and harder to do that hehe.  Still, I am not going to give<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I got this mental image that I wanted to share here (and I am<br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto date myself here)...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are watching TV late at night, or bowling on Sunday afternoon maybe, and<br/>\na<br/>\ncommercial comes on for (drumroll please...) the Ronco Fish-O-Matic!<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks, this is 68 fishing tools in one!  You can leave that heavy, extra box<br/>\nfull of tools at home, just slip one of these beauties in your tackle box<br/>\nand<br/>\nyou are set!  It&#39;s shiny!  It looks great!  Be the envy of your friends!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you buy one and head out on your first fishing trip.  And guess what?  It<br/>\nsorta works.  It almost does what they said.  You have to put extra effort<br/>\ninto<br/>\neverything, and you have to be really careful because it isn&#39; very sturdy<br/>\nand<br/>\nyou might break it.  And even when you are careful from time to time it just<br/>\nsnaps and you get a nasty cut.  But it isn&#39;t JUNK exactly....<br/>\n<br/>\nYou getting where I am going with this?  LOL that&#39;s right - bards are the EQ<br/>\nequivalent of the all-in-one Fish-O-Matic.  We do work OK much of the time,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nya gotta be really careful.  And if you can afford to haul the real thing,<br/>\nyou&#39;d be better off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a wry smile and a jaunty salute,<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n54 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
