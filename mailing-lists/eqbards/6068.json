The other Bard should<br/>\nhave Accel&#39;d them out of there. If the 16th Bard couldnt hit it<br/>\nmuch, you would have been whiffing like a minor leaguer at 13th<br/>\nlevel. As for escape, its not your job to sacrifice your life<br/>\nwhen they had every opportunity to run themselves. That amounts<br/>\nto them saying, &quot;Why should we run?

I was sharing the<br/>\nsisters bandit camp in Lesser fay with a group of 3 others.  All of the<br/>\nother players were 15-16 level and in a group, and consisted of a Ranger,<br/>\nBard, and a Magician.  At the time I was 15th level and am quite capable of<br/>\nsoloing the camp while alone, so I wasen&#39;t milking off them.  We had a good<br/>\nthing going and were being very friendly to one another untill something odd<br/>\nhappend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was waiting for my spawn, when I heared the sounds of battle behind me.  I<br/>\nfigured that they were killing a giant spider or somthing in between spawns<br/>\nas I often do.  But something didn&#39;t sound right.  I turned around to see<br/>\nthe 16th level Bard and the 15th level Ranger, attacking a named Brownie.<br/>\nMy jaw dropped as I asessed the situation.  The brownie was hardly hit at<br/>\nall and the two where below half health already.  Now was my time for snap<br/>\ndeciscions.  Should I help out, or should I bug out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[SNIP]<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up stopping for the night to try think of anything I could have done<br/>\nbetter, it all happend so fast.  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin 16th Human Bard<br/>\nBrell Server<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
