Thanks Ranian Ranian, I am just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2060844710\">Can someone send me there downtime macro for weaving Mana and healing? I<br/>\nthink I need to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nRanian<br/>\n<br/>\nRanian,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just catching up with the many emails of late.  Downtime macro I use:<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n/pause 30, /cast 3<br/>\n/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n/cast 4<br/>\n/e sings a soothing tune<br/>\n<br/>\nI always stopsong at the beginning of my macro since most time I already<br/>\nhave a song up that needs stopping.  My pause 5 is time I need to recover<br/>\nconsistently.<br/>\n<br/>\nCast 3 is either Cantana or HOR depending on group makeup(Cantana for<br/>\nheavier caster group and HOR for heavier melee).  My pause 30 is for my<br/>\ntiming of casting time for buff icon to come up before next song.<br/>\n<br/>\nStopsong again and pause to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\nCast 4 is Chorus of Clarity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy emote is just let everyone I group with know what I am doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI leave Clarity song going for two pulses and hit the macro again.  If I<br/>\ndon&#39;t pay attention or go afk for a sec, clarity continues to play = happy<br/>\ncasters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I use three macros during combat.  Based on my own experience<br/>\nand knowledge gained from this list, they are only 2 line macros.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach combat macro uses this base structure:<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n/cast x  (where x is the number of the song you want to cast).<br/>\n<br/>\nI label them Fight 1, Fight 2 and Fight 3.  If I need a different song, I<br/>\neither edit the macro to a different song already memmed or mem in the right<br/>\nsong.  What does this do for you?  I only have to hit three keys to twist<br/>\ninstead of six(don&#39;t have to stop a song anymore).  I only use 2 line macros<br/>\nin case there is a problem and I need to do something else.  Macros can&#39;t be<br/>\nstopped(that I know of) so long macros can cause a problem.  (ie, you just<br/>\nstarted a long macro, then big bad mob spawns on cleric, you want to charm<br/>\nit, but ack! you can&#39;t due to the macro must run its course... you can see<br/>\nthe potential problem)<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\nBard of 39 Songs<br/>\nThe Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
