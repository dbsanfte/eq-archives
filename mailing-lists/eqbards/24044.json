It mostly seems to be<br/>\nrhetorical debate; or perhaps the comment that people are exaggerating too<br/>\nmuch.  Keep in mind that  - like analogies exaggerating the opposite of what<br/>\nyou are arguing is also a rhetorical device.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean this as a flame to Whee, (by singling him out); but the<br/>\nargument (if I&#39;m not following it correctly I apologize in advance) seems to<br/>\nbe that the thread is Whee one side and everyone else (who participating in<br/>\nthe thread) on the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) DDD - are you saying that this IS a useful song?  That 99 pct of the<br/>\nBards are wrong - that it is VERY useful; or simply that it is very slightly<br/>\nuseful and we are &quot;ridiculously exaggerating&quot; by saying something is<br/>\n&quot;completely&quot; useless instead of &quot;very marginally&quot; useless.  Not MUCH of an<br/>\nexaggeration there if you ask me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The PvP thing was argued a bit - but someone pointed out how Verant has<br/>\nmade it very clear they claim they are specifically tuning this song to<br/>\nbalance bards across the board.  There has been no indication that this is a<br/>\nPVP.  While it could be a &quot;stealth component&quot; of the tuning a) I doubt it<br/>\nand b) it&#39;s not taking the issue at face value especially considering the<br/>\nwhole &quot;Class Balance&quot; threads<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Bards are over powered.  You haven&#39;t really spent much time arguing<br/>\nthat - and I&#39;m not quite clear on your argument for that.   Perhaps it is<br/>\ndue to soloing ability.  I despise soloing and never do it.  Personally - if<br/>\nyou were to judge EQ as a solo game; it is VERY poor.  Any single-player RPG<br/>\ngame rings around EQ as a single-player game.  If I felt like single-player<br/>\ngaming I&#39;d play BG2.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the argument was spent on time arguing percentages - but that was<br/>\npretty much arguing 1+2 I guess...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thread kind of reminds me of the Monty Python Argument sketch - the<br/>\nargument SEEMS to be going nowhere just argument for arguments sake (that&#39;s<br/>\nan exaggeration too by the way)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - I don&#39;t mean this as a flame - or even negative in any way - I&#39;m<br/>\njust intellectually both intrigued and very confused at the same time as to<br/>\nwhat is REALLY being argued...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
