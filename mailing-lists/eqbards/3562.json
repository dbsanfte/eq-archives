There&#39;s one of three possiblities for<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n1.  Level - It may be that as you level, as with other songs, Solon&#39;s tune<br/>\ngrows in strength ( ie duration of the charm)<br/>\n2.  Charisma - I&#39;ve acquired two opalline earrings over the past 6 levels or<br/>\nso, boosting my charisma by 10 points, so perhaps as with an enchanter<br/>\ncharisma effects duration of and resistance to charm<br/>\n3.  Lag - ever since Rallos has moved to CerfNet or whatever isp currently<br/>\nsupports its connection, we&#39;ve been plagued with packet loss no less than<br/>\n1.6 %  and occasionally as much as 30 %  all constant.  Could be it just<br/>\nisn&#39;t updating the charm wearing off as quickly as in a lag free<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when I was level 24, I inquired about this song on this list and<br/>\nsomeone told me it only works on mobs 25 and under due to the relatively<br/>\nrecent charm changes.  That is not true, it works well with even red mobs<br/>\noccasionally.  It&#39;s my only real defense against Hill Giants because, as you<br/>\nhad said, the range on this sucker is incredible.  Soon as a Giant gets<br/>\nwithin bellow range, that&#39;s just about enough range for them to hit me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to note is, just as with any other charming spell, the mob<br/>\nwill not leave you alone once it&#39;s been charmed.  I&#39;ve twinked my friend<br/>\nquite a bit with the help of this.  -=)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
