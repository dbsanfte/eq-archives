The damage from<br/>\n&gt; this song is, to put it mildly, outlandish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve actually been dropping Beserker&#39;s for CoD (yes, the level<br/>\n&gt; 2 song) if there&#39;s only 1-2 tanks in the party.  Their job is<br/>\n&gt; to soak up damage, not dish it out.  Rogues are an exception.<br/>\n&gt; I figure the extra damage from CoD (with a lute since I<br/>\n&gt; already have it equipped for CoC) provides more benefit than<br/>\n&gt; the slowdown with Chain or Binding would.  I still keep Chain<br/>\n&gt; loaded for runner control though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Standard songs in AE-capable locations is Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC +<br/>\n&gt; CoD (you have more leeway with the DoTs since they last 3<br/>\n&gt; pulses).  If we&#39;re not taking much damage, I may substitute<br/>\n&gt; Beserker&#39;s for Niv&#39;s or Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm..  50HPs a tick is definitely higher than either my average or mean<br/>\ndamage with Dawnchanser and Ykesha.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo setting aside party buffs for a moment and looking at the songs purely<br/>\nfrom a HP perspective (lute equipped) where &#39;m&#39; is mob and &#39;p&#39; is player<br/>\nit&#39;s:<br/>\n<br/>\n  CoC  +   CoD  +   Niv  +  Hymn  =<br/>\n(m-50) + (m-17) + (p+14) + (p+19) =<br/>\n<br/>\n-67 to m and + 33 to p. (with some estimated numbers)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s definitely non-trivial dmg, but as you know the mobs we fight at our<br/>\nlevel routinely hit even the tanks in excess of 33 dmg.  Hell it&#39;s three to<br/>\nfive times that.  So while the healing is nice, it&#39;s obviously not a<br/>\nsubstite for someone dressed like a grape.  Although it might let ya solo a<br/>\ncouple of SKs, that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to try this attack method, however, I&#39;m on analog modem and PII<br/>\n400.  Weaving three songs is normally pretty easy, but four leaves<br/>\nsignificant gaps.

I was in a party of<br/>\nthree (50 Cleric, 50 Druid and myself) and I was soloing the room.  Honest.<br/>\nThe Cleric and Druid were maxxed at 50 and they were healing and doing 49%<br/>\ndmg to the mobs and letting me solo for experience.  Heck I &quot;solod&quot; a<br/>\nBloodthirsty Ghoul.  Anyhow, a bugged and stuck frog took the long way<br/>\naround on one of my pulls and brought about 7 frogs including a wizard.  I&#39;m<br/>\nyelling evac before I even get back to the group.  With Screech going and<br/>\nfrogs running back and forth from me we literally had time to stand there<br/>\nand talk about whether or not to attempt them before finally evac&#39;ed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo *any* other classes have AE Fear?
