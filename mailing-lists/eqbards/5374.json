I have a pearl, and need to find a jewler.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even after level 20. I<br/>\n&gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and almost always over<br/>\n&gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will have up<br/>\n&gt; to 1000 to<br/>\n&gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats a pain<br/>\n&gt; is getting<br/>\n&gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. This is why I<br/>\n&gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for awesome<br/>\n&gt; items I or my<br/>\n&gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
