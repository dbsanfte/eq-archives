Well, you need magical weapons to hit<br/>\n&gt; certain monsters and &quot;combine&quot; weaps are ones you can purchase.  A combine<br/>\n&gt; dagger goes for about 33pp, long sword and scimitars about 62pp.  They are<br/>\n&gt; sold at the gypsy camps in North Karana, Lavastorm and Rathe Mountains.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all 3 places, I&#39;d say Rathe Mountains is the safest although perhaps<br/>\n&gt; furthest one to get to.  Lavastorm has lots of fire elementals that can<br/>\n&gt; attack and they are nasty.  North Karana has griffins and lions and such<br/>\n&gt; that come right thru the gypsy camp.  Rathe Mts has far fewer monsters so<br/>\n&gt; very close to the camp but it woould be quite a trek to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I bought my Combine Longsword early in my bardic career in Oasis near at the<br/>\ngypsy camp there.
