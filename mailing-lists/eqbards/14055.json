Unfortunatly, <br/>\nbetween March and Today, I played 5 characters that I will likely never play again.  Learning <br/>\nthis game took alot of time for me, as I had limited time to play due to family and time <br/>\nschedules varying.  Everytime I found a &quot;click&quot; they would out level me and move on  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally settled down on my 2nd Bard, a Wood Elf and stuck with it.  There are definate <br/>\npeaks and lulls in my life as a bard.  Ie.  Being lvl 23 for 2 weeks??  why??  dunno.  I actually <br/>\nleveled through lvl 30 faster than I did lvl 23 even though I died 8 times at lvl 30  :(  Life is <br/>\ntough at times.  Anyways, Lvls 27-30 took 2 days of about 5-7 days each.  Why? steady <br/>\nblues and no deaths.  This seems to be the key in all things.  It seems that this game gets <br/>\neasier with time, I certainly think so.  As you get higher, you play with more compentant <br/>\npeople.  Sure, you understand the game if you play to 20, but beyond that is where the <br/>\nlearning begins.  Certainly it will continue for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for rambling, I suppose what I want to say as well is that having a high level character <br/>\nhas nothing to do with having the Power Level Tendancies.  Often being in the right place at <br/>\nthe right time and meeting the right people will level you beyond your wildest dreams all the <br/>\nwhile you are having a great time goofing off on the down times.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynnx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ** Original Subject: RE: [eqbards] (OT) Lower level discrimination was Play Time?<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Sender: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Date: Mon, 31 Jan 2000 08:37:14 -0600<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ** Original Message follows... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I wanted to answer this, and quote things from the message<br/>\n&gt;   but I haven&#39;t the energy.  I&#39;ll tell you this much:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I made level 50 after 9 months, Verant suggested it would take 12<br/>\n&gt;   months to make level 50.  I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average <br/>\n&gt;   bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>\n&gt;   take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt;   this way.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.
