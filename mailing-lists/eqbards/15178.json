The Dirk has the best dam/delay ratio of any weapon even<br/>\nclose to how easy it is to obtain.  I keep at least 1 of each type (1H<br/>\nslash, 1H Blunt, Piercing) on my Bard at all times and rotate them<br/>\nregularly, trying to keep ALL my skills maxed.  There are some good weapons<br/>\nof ALL types around and you never know which will be available to you.<br/>\nStart early by keeping your skills maxed and you&#39;ll be ready to use whatever<br/>\nthe best weapon is available to you at that time.  With dual wield this is<br/>\neven easier to do, being able to work on 2 skill types at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention that you should raise your piercing skill? : )<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
