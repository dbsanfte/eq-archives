If you also don t have a GOOD up-to-date virus ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1402642980\">Having a DSL connection and NOT have a firewall is the same as leaving the<br/>\nkeys in your car overnight.  If you also don&#39;t have a GOOD up-to-date virus<br/>\nprotection you may already have been infiltrated.  Make sure you have the<br/>\nlatest Virus update and run a full disk scan.<br/>\n<br/>\nDSL is always on - and usually has a fixed-IP address.  That makes you very<br/>\neasy to find.  To make things worse - there are viruses like the QaZ virus<br/>\nthat use infected machines as attack points - and search similar IP<br/>\naddresses for security holes - and then will install itself on that<br/>\nmachine... I have DSL and get on average about a dozen attacks at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is especially true if you use EQ.  A friend of mine who has DSL and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a firewall had his EQ account hacked.  The guy was able to sniff<br/>\nout his Station name and password and logged on to his EQ character and<br/>\ntried to sell all his items.  Fortunately he was a well known player - and<br/>\nsome friends gave him a tell asking why he was selling the items they knew<br/>\nhe USED.  The way the guy responded made it clear it wasn&#39;t him.  They<br/>\nreported it to a guide who immediately kicked and locked the account.<br/>\nFortunately for Uuena - this happened fast enough that the guy didn&#39;t have<br/>\ntime to actually sell anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would IMMEDIATELY get a firewall program.  By the way - if you&#39;re<br/>\nreally paranoid - never publicly post what firewall you are using.  There<br/>\nare potential holes in any firewall - and if someone knows what product you<br/>\nare using they can exploit that knowledge...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gordon Hughes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ghughes@...\">ghughes@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 06, 2000 10:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT: Recommendation for a home firewall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I am running on a DSL connection, would I gain any benefit from using a<br/>\nfirewall such as Black Ice?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pc isn&#39;t networked (yet) and I&#39;m wondering if I need that sort of<br/>\nsecurity.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use Black Ice defender.
