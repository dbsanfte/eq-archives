Try to have someone who can pull singles, either from<br/>\nknowledge of the zone or high enough archery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area behind the music room is somewhat safe.  I went in with a 50<br/>\ndruid who knew the area very well, so I just let him do his thing.  For<br/>\neveryone in guilds, see if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s experienced in<br/>\nMistmoorian pulling, and make sure they come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went in a week ago to help a paladin get his Soulfire hilt.  The SK that<br/>\ndrops it is in the jacuzzi room, which we reached via the secret room<br/>\nentrance to the castle.  While sitting around waiting for him to spawn, I<br/>\ngot HT&#39;d.

Then at least 20 more gargs, ancilles,<br/>\nushers, thought spoilers all piled into this teensy room.
