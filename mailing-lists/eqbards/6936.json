We get a different song every level.  Sure, not<br/>\nall of them are useful, but at least every song is different.  We have 50<br/>\nsongs (or will if they ever get around to adding the missing 4 or so) and<br/>\nthere is almost no overlap.  Each song has a pretty unique effect such that<br/>\nI am still finding a use for my level 1 and 2 songs at level 41.  Many of<br/>\nour songs become more powerful as we level, making low level songs still<br/>\nvery viable at very high levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, look at casters.  They get maybe 8 to 12 spells every four<br/>\nlevels (assuming the &quot;pure&quot; casting classes).  However, every 4 to 8 levels<br/>\nmany of their spells are replaced with more powerful versions of previous<br/>\nones.  This actually leaves for very little variety.  You won&#39;t find a level<br/>\n50 mage still using a level 4 pet.  That spell has become useless.<br/>\nComparing us to casters by saying they get a couple pages of spells every<br/>\nfew levels doesn&#39;t seem reasonable when you consider how many of their<br/>\nspells are rendered completely useless by a more powerful version.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I didn&#39;t like your idea, but I meant no offence.  Its like a<br/>\nmage saying all their pet spells should be replaced with more useful things,<br/>\nand just make their low level pet get more powerful with levels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you look at it this way, I don&#39;t really see how casters have more<br/>\nspells to chose from than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 41 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 11:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are not casters.

We get *one* &#39;mystical power&#39; per level<br/>\nwhereas other characters get *multiple* &#39;mystical<br/>\npowers&#39; per level. These &#39;mystical powers&#39; are the<br/>\nbackbone of our class just as they are the backbone<br/>\nof the other classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that fit your requirements a bit better? The<br/>\ncomparison isn&#39;t silly at all. We only get one<br/>\nsong per level. It would be nice to have that only<br/>\nsong be worthwhile. The poster I replied to was<br/>\ncomparing a caster having a useless &#39;power&#39; to our<br/>\nhaving a useless &#39;power&#39;. I was pointing out that<br/>\nwhen we have a single useless &#39;power&#39; it&#39;s not the<br/>\nsame as a caster since they get more of these to<br/>\nchoose from than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing silly in that.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
