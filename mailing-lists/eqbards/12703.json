Lets assume after they code the fix equipping a drum will<br/>\nnow increase the damage of the DOT and the amount of magic resistance the<br/>\nmobs loses.  I think we should remind them to remember the MM battle drum<br/>\nwhen they code the fix.  Singing Furfil&#39;s with the MM battle drum equipped<br/>\nshould increase the DOT and magic resistance amount 20% (I think thats what<br/>\neveryone says it increases resist songs by) more than with a normal drum<br/>\nequipped.  Based on their track record, if we don&#39;t remind them they will<br/>\nprobably forget about including the MM battle drum as part of the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion<br/>\n&gt; aspect <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken.
