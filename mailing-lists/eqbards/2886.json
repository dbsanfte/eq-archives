They flourish on the Hill Giant<br/>\nmountain.  You can set up camp near the sign to High Hold (where the Paladin<br/>\nstops) and lure to there.  Not great loot, but great experience.  Crag&#39;s are<br/>\nabout level 18 - 20, so bring a friend or 2.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nBroon also spawns very close there, so be careful.... Or.... when you&#39;re a<br/>\nlittle higher level (he&#39;s 23) with a little higher group, bring justice to<br/>\nhis ugly homer simpson looking skull.  :)  Seems we were the first on Xegony<br/>\nto have this idea (yesterday) and I expect it to be sorely camped in the<br/>\nnear future... : /<br/>\n(again horrible loot tho, so maybe not).  We did it with a Level 23<br/>\nMagician, a Level 21 Magician, and a Level 20 Bard (me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol - Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;4.
