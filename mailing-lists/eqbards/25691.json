I have played the song for hours, leaving my character logged in overnight and only gone up 5 to 10 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften people would see me at the FV platform (near the food/water selller near the bridge) idling my time away.  I don&#39;t know if VI considers it cheating to do it, but it was my only way to train up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least this all was required before the latest release.  Used to require you wielding the instrument to go up in skills.  I&#39;ve seen my skills increase, the last couple tics to max 250 when not using the appropriate instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElanna 55th Bard, Innorruk.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  The Arena off of Lake Rathe is also another good place to practice for those that need to play the AE brass song early on.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
