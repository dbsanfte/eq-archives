Verant was smart enough to figure out that<br/>\nall the rangers killing Meldrath for the quest causing the<br/>\nhero to spawn would cause (A) lots of dead newbies, and/or<br/>\n(B) lots of people with hero bracers.  So they changed it so<br/>\nthe hero no longer spawns when you kill Meldrath.  (They also<br/>\nupgraded Meldrath to mid-high 30s, and lowered the mino guards<br/>\nto 20s.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, he used to spawn when Meldrath was killed.
