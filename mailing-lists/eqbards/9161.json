I<br/>\nwas holding the final, crucial piece after a week of<br/>\nquesting.  I was in High Hold Pass, the meeting was an<br/>\nhour away, so I start burning towards Lesser Fey with<br/>\nthe final ingrediant.  After the zones, the boat trip,<br/>\nrunning throung Greater Fey, all the guildsay is<br/>\nbascially &quot;is he here yet&quot;.  I&#39;m blazing, I look down<br/>\nto grab my drink, I look up and I&#39;m leaping from the<br/>\ntop of the wizard gate at full speed.  This was back<br/>\nbefore high level clerics where running around all<br/>\nover the place.  The guild decided to go ahead without<br/>\nme, as I was bound in HHK.  I was soooooooo mad.  Now<br/>\nit seems funny, but man...<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n<br/>\n--- David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just thought I&#39;d share this little tid-bit of idiocy<br/>\n&gt; with y&#39;all....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just yesterday, I finally decided to go get my<br/>\n&gt; Lambent Bracer (my first<br/>\n&gt; lambent piece). I contacted my druid friend and had<br/>\n&gt; him gate me to<br/>\n&gt; lavastorm.  I entered the temple and made my way to<br/>\n&gt; the two quest NPC&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; (forget their names).  I was checking and<br/>\n&gt; re-checking, to make sure I had<br/>\n&gt; the correct components/cash.  I was asking about all<br/>\n&gt; the Lambent pieces -<br/>\n&gt; insuring that my list was still up-to-date.  As soon<br/>\n&gt; as I typed the &#39;a&#39; in<br/>\n&gt; lambent, I started attacking the female NPC.  I made<br/>\n&gt; a futile attempt to<br/>\n&gt; flee, but I made it no further than 10 paces before<br/>\n&gt; I became worm food.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My friend asks : &quot;What are you doing in Greater<br/>\n&gt; faydark?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I respond : &quot;You won&#39;t believe what I just did...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Needless to say, that was about the single dumbest<br/>\n&gt; thing I&#39;ve done in this<br/>\n&gt; game yet.  Since I was feeling pretty bad about<br/>\n&gt; myself (I must admit it was<br/>\n&gt; pretty hilarious though) I wanted to see if any of<br/>\n&gt; you fine bards had<br/>\n&gt; boneheaded experiences of your own to share.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Desmei Sightblinder<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 30 Bard [Povar] - I did, eventually, get my<br/>\n&gt; bracer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
