You could, at level 30, walk around in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the undead simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far above them in level.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING the undead.  They still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which means they can see you.  They just won&#39;t agg because you are higher level than them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia the amused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
