And spend<br/>\nsome time on Hot Key management a favorite of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     Keep Jaxon&#39;s Jig of Vigor on your spell list. If you stamina falls<br/>\nbelow a third in a long fight you will need to play it to remain<br/>\neffective. The faster you kill the less damage you take.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt 6)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  At level 28 I am still using my PGT and love it. It is not unusual for<br/>\nme to look up and see most of my team at half health in a heated fight<br/>\nand I am still hardly nicked, even sometimes when playing lullaby if the<br/>\nPGT is Procing (casting invulnerability ) well. Keeping Dex above 100<br/>\nand having good stamina helps. I am experimenting with Thullian Claws I<br/>\njust got and my old standby the Dragoon Dirk, switching them out in both<br/>\nprimary and secondary slots with the PGT.... but that is another<br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) And what are some good hot keys to have set up as I&#39;m just learning the skill?<br/>\n&gt; Pava, Bard of measure 16 Silent Dragons Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Ok, Hot Key management. First off we have 6 banks or &quot;pages&quot; of hot<br/>\nkeys to setup. Each page has 6 &quot;slots&quot; in pairs of 2 you should map to<br/>\nyour key pad so that reading right to left 1 and 2 are the top, 3 and 4<br/>\nare the second pair and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank One : This is the primary and I want it to be the one I use to<br/>\nquickly switch weapons and instruments.<br/>\n          Slot 1: drag your Primary melee slot here, the one with your<br/>\nlead weapon.<br/>\n          Slot 2: drag an Secondary melee slot here. This is where you<br/>\nwill be putting your instrument.<br/>\n          Slot 3: drag an empty inventory slot here where you will dump<br/>\na weapon (faster than bagging it. I <br/>\n                  will explain later). I use the bottom right slot #6 as<br/>\nit is the last to fill in looting.<br/>\n          Slot 4: drag the inventory slot where you will keep your<br/>\nShralok Pack :) or large bag (back                           packs are<br/>\ntoo heavy to use) with all your instruments and weapons inside.<br/>\n          Slot 5: drag your &quot;sit/stand&quot; button here.<br/>\n          Slot 6: I drag my &quot;assist&quot; social button here so I can easily<br/>\nmodify it during down time to add in <br/>\n                  the name of the designated Tank ( /assist Killer ) and<br/>\nswitch targets in combat if I am in                    the middle of<br/>\nweapon changes.<br/>\n  The beauty of this set up is it&#39;s speed. To go from weapons to<br/>\ninstruments click on the bag. Notice it opens just above and off to the<br/>\nright of the hot key bank. Very convenient. Click on Melee weapon in<br/>\nslot 1 picking it up. Move it over the instrument you want and click.<br/>\nThey switch. With your lute or what ever on your pointer now moving down<br/>\nto the left click on Melee slot 2 switching it into that slot. Now STILL<br/>\nMOVING IN The same direction you can dump the secondary weapon into the<br/>\nempty inventory slot 3. Why not put it back in the bag ? because<br/>\nminimize your chance of dropping it by staying over the Hot Key bank,<br/>\nthe slot is closer than the bag and you don&#39;t have to change directions<br/>\nto get there. I can change from weapons to instruments in literally 2<br/>\nseconds and the reverse motion to get weapons back is just as fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bank Two : No question. This is where you will drag the spells you want<br/>\nto play in combat.<br/>\n            Use slots 1, 2 and 3 for your main songs you are &quot;twisting&quot;,<br/>\nAnthem, Largos, Shield.. whatever.<br/>\n            Slot 4, corresponding to keypad 4 is the next easiest key to<br/>\nget to and that is where I put my<br/>\n            Chain song. Brusco&#39;s Bellow and (heaven forbid) Run song are<br/>\nother good options here.<br/>\n            Slot 5 is where I myself put heal. For me is is easy to go<br/>\nfrom a 1,2,3 pattern to a 1,5,3             pattern.<br/>\n            Slot 6- The ever required ASSIST key goes here.<br/>\n            Odd stuff like lullaby, that I am going to have to just keep<br/>\npunching, I access from the                   regular on screen bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank Three : Your &quot;Get out of Town&quot; Bank. Could be bank 6 but put it<br/>\nwhere you can get to it fast and                      since I have a<br/>\nmouse in one hand its a lot faster to click an arrow than find and punch<br/>\n2 keys <br/>\n             simultaneously to get to another bank. <br/>\n            Slot 1 /corpse ...may you never need it. But having it on<br/>\nthis key makes it very convenient for                    continual<br/>\npunching while running past that Hill Giant with your body bouncing<br/>\nalong behind :)<br/>\n            Slot 2 Run song<br/>\n            Slot 3 Heal song<br/>\n            Slot 4 Sense heading<br/>\n            Slot 5 /Loc<br/>\n            Slot 6 Forage<br/>\n<br/>\nBank Four : This is my &quot;Fun&quot; bank with animation&#39;s like &quot;Shiver&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;laugh&quot;, &quot;dance&quot; and I also have my guild                button here<br/>\nthat reads &quot;/who all Rising&quot; so I can see who is where for grouping.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank Five : Your choice. You might set this up for doing your DD/AEO<br/>\nsongs and instrument swap out keys as in             bank. I&#39;d put<br/>\nDenon&#39;s, Chords of Dissonence and Bellows on 1,2 and 3 with the melee<br/>\nand inventory slots<br/>\n            in 5 and 6 for easy swapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank Six : No question for a level 28 Bard. Your Charm Bank needs to be<br/>\nclose to your battle banks.<br/>\n           This is easy. Charm song in slot 1 followed by Pet command<br/>\nkeys /Pet guard me and /Pet Kill <br/>\n           Slot 4 holds my Heal song. /Pet guard here and /Pet back off<br/>\nare slots 5 and 6. I am still                    experimenting with<br/>\nthis. Input welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope this helps and I know that some others will have schemes that<br/>\nthey like better but I have tested this one and why reinvent the wheel<br/>\nwhen you don&#39;t have to.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Moonflower Bllue<br/>\n    House of the Rising Phoenix<br/>\n    Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
