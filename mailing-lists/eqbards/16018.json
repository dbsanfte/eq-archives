Especially the Erudite Paladin. For one<br/>\nthing, the disadvantages were supposed to be coupled with advantages, as<br/>\nin the large race warriors being KoS and having a large experience<br/>\npenalty, but as we&#39;ve found out, the increased stats of the large races<br/>\nare effectively meaningless, giving them nothing except a slightly<br/>\nlarger hp advantage over smaller warriors. At the same time, we&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat smaller races with their higher agility likewise recieve no<br/>\nmeasureable improvement in avoiding taking damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, even if stats mattered, the Erudite Paladin get&#39;s no<br/>\nadvantage at all to balance out their pathetic stats. So really all the<br/>\nshield will give the paladin is an increased carrying capacity, which in<br/>\nthe case of a planes ready character means they can wear something other<br/>\nthan a thick banded belt, and a few more hp. And a nice chunk of AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAFAIC, the AC would be the only thing to complain about, if there are no<br/>\nsimilar shields for Paladins of other races.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Mar 13/00, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, 11 Mar 2000, Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i have 2 friends who have done this.  a cleric started an erudite paladin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just because of the shield from hate (paladin now level 46) and a shaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend created a druid to gate around and get him herbs for alchemy (druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now level 44, not bad since alchemy just started).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really dislike that shield (35 AC, +20 str, +20 sta,<br/>\n&gt; ultravision).
