Personally, I&#39;d put off going there until<br/>\n&gt; everywhere else you can possibly hunt is green. At mid-high 30&#39;s I think<br/>\n&gt; the king room in perma is still quite blue. I&#39;m not sure when the exp<br/>\n&gt; tapers off in the king and other deep areas in Sol A, but I&#39;d check<br/>\n&gt; there.
