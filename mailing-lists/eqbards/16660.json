The<br/>\n&gt; number of people in your group will make a big difference in<br/>\n&gt; the group&#39;s ability.  The biggest jump is going from 1 person<br/>\n&gt; to 2 people (double the hp, double the damage output = killing<br/>\n&gt; stuff twice as fast with half the downtime).  So when your<br/>\n&gt; bard leaves, the drop in your group&#39;s effectiveness is not<br/>\n&gt; just due to lack of a bard, it&#39;s also due to lack of a 4th<br/>\n&gt; group member.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, don&#39;t let my bard hear this, I was figuring it out to encourage<br/>\nher...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real basis of comparison is when the wizard isn;t there.  (The<br/>\nparty obviously loses huge amounts of effieciency without a real tank<br/>\nand healer, ie the cleric and warrior).  I would say our xp is equal<br/>\nwith or without the wizard (we kill enough to equal the xp she takes),<br/>\nbut your explanation of how damage ratios change (and I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>\nabout that as long as I&#39;ve been here) kind of explains that.  Also we<br/>\nstruggle to add a good player when she leaves.  And even if they are a<br/>\ngood player, it takes time to adjust them to the way we play.  (We use<br/>\nsome unusal techniques at times, we like to experiement, my personal<br/>\nfavorite is tryiong to get extra mobs to agro on the wiz so she can run<br/>\naround and root them)<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, at lvl 20 a wizard cannot come close to a warrior in damage right<br/>\nnow.  The Langseax quest is easy for 2 lvl 20&#39;s (we did it with the<br/>\nwarrior and my bard for ease of travel and finding the bear, a druid<br/>\nwould make it even easier), so I put that as the non twinked lvl 20<br/>\nwarrior weapon.  In big fights (where the wizard blows out all her mana)<br/>\nshe keeps pace with him, but in the small fights, theres no comparison. <br/>\nWe were figuring out how many hp Broon had (we were bored while<br/>\nmedding).  In that fight (which we went total overkill for, since we<br/>\nthought he was going to be much harder), the warrior did about 45%, the<br/>\nwiz about 40% and the bard about 15%.  (Bard was singing anthem, hymm,<br/>\nbinding, and we gave the warrior credit for all his damage, some %<br/>\nshoudl actually be given to the bard)  (Heh also, yes I have become a<br/>\ntrue pansy cleric, I wear a blue and gray jumpsuit, and sit on my duff<br/>\nfor 90% of the combat)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
