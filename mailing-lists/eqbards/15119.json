I sent<br/>\nfeedback and petitioned.  The GM who answered submitted a bug report.  I also<br/>\ncontacted Shada and a few others to ask them if they noticed and to submit something<br/>\nif they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI unfortunately have no hard baseline against which to compare.  Would someone who<br/>\ndoes please repeat a test?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a happier note and to address someone who asked about the minotaur hero: I<br/>\ncompleted the quest last night.  When I arrived in Steamfont a druid gentleman was<br/>\nwaiting for the hero and said he had been there 4 hours and missed the one spawn<br/>\nwhen he left briefly.  He soon logged and I was very fortunate because the hero<br/>\nspwaned when I had been there less than an hour.  So that is two heroes in about 5<br/>\nhours.  I know people were camping Meldrath and I was killing minos in the maze for<br/>\nsomething to do and with slight hope it would help.  Perhaps I was just very very<br/>\nlucky; perhaps killing the minos did help.  Either way I am very pleased =).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh one other thing: GrimFeather drops lambent stones, did you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n//Maravana Vireo<br/>\n//50th Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\n//Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
