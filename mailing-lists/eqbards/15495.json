(This is an awesome<br/>\nplace to go from 12 - 15).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go south you will come to a large undead camp. The camp has 3 Giant<br/>\nSkele spawns, 3-4 Dry Bones, 2-3 Barbed Bones, and a bunch of regular<br/>\nskeles. Occasionally you will see Skeletal Monks there too. This area (if<br/>\nyou go around the wall) will link up with Hill Giant Hill. In the center of<br/>\nthe area you will find basilisks and drakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a decent map of the area:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html\">http://www.eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the 28th measure<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 28, 2000 11:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Rathe Mtns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some exploring in Rathe Mts - its one heck of a zone.  Get a map if you<br/>\nare so inclined because it&#39;s as bad or worse than Steamfont and ButcherBlock<br/>\nwith &#39;dead end&#39; canyons, etc. But here is a quick run down...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Lake zone, if you go to the right and follow the wall, you will find an<br/>\nundead camp.  It also has a gnome necro (or mage? pet caster I think.)<br/>\nVariety of undead spawn there. You can keep going and follow that wall til<br/>\nyou get to the gypsy camp.   By now you will have circled almost the Homer<br/>\nPlateau.  Clops and GSkels spawn on sides and top and in the valley floor.<br/>\nHeh, my 27 - now 28 wizard has been busy dutifully KS&#39;ing them from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt gypsy camp, you can either cut back to the lake zone (or from lake zone,<br/>\ninstead of going around Homer Hill, you could have cut to the Gypsys) or go<br/>\naround the cornor hugging wall on right to see some Inns & Shops. If you<br/>\nhave a dragon scale and lots of money, Karim Darkforge will make you some<br/>\npretty good armor &lt;g&gt; otherwise stock up on bloodstones & jaspers (oh yeah,<br/>\nwant to change gold and silver to plat? Buy a combine wep from the gypsy and<br/>\nsell it back for a 10% exchange rate.)  And if you skirt behind the inns and<br/>\nkeep going down the path, soon you pass the named bugs and if you keep going<br/>\nslightly left-ish, you will see on the right a path over a rock where likely<br/>\nmobs will be &#39;stuck&#39; and spinning.  This is &quot;the stuck rock&quot; or &quot;spinning<br/>\nstone&quot; and if you go through that pass and kind hug right wall soon enough<br/>\nit opens and there is a plateau ahead and a path to right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat plateau is Hill Giant Hill.  With HG, Homers & GSkells. Actually all<br/>\nover in this area are HG, Clops & GSkels. So those are some places to<br/>\nexplore.  Find a spot on edge to camp and pull stuff to your camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go back out by stuck rock and keep going - over more ricks and stuff<br/>\nbut straight-ish, soon there is the zone to Feerot. And you will be going<br/>\nthis way to get to Cazic Thule in about 5 more levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 47 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwhite@...\">pwhite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 28, 2000 9:44 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Rathe Mtns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwhite@...\">pwhite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hunted Giant Skeletons over the weekend near the entrance to Lake Rathe.<br/>\n&gt; I was in a low 20&#39;s group of 4 and the xp was great.
