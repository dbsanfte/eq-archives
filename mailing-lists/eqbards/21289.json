As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>\nthan my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far several issues are unaddressed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>\nis. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>\nwe can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>\nmore effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>\ncan prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>\nresist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>\nthink we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I propose...<br/>\nI&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>\nLullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>\ncritter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>\non. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>\nacurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>\nwell as the log file.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nMinstel of Norrath<br/>\nTribunal Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
