A dry bones skeleten is standing there, takes a<br/>\nlook around, spots me out of a crowd of 30 camped players sitting against<br/>\nthe wall, and makes a b-line for me.  We handily dispatched him and all got<br/>\na good laugh.  30 seconds later.  *Creaaak*, opens the door.  A reanimated<br/>\nhand is standing there, sniffs the air, spots me again and makes a run for<br/>\nme, completely ignoring everyone else.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happened four or five times before we were forced to zone.  My puller<br/>\nwas pretty happy that his job was so easy, until a flock of GDBs came<br/>\nrunning and we had to run.  I hadn&#39;t even been into the house that night to<br/>\nstir anything up.  This has happened to me on several occasions.  Its pretty<br/>\nfunny as long as its something you can handle, but a pair of hags hunting me<br/>\ndown for no apparent reason isn&#39;t a pretty sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, life as a bard :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n26th level bard<br/>\nErollosi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 3:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Center of attention<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>\nactually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>\nbut a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>\nwhinning about the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>\nsongs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>\nsure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>\ndammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric. <br/>\nWell, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>\nwhole new places.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>\nbashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>\nand loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>\nroom.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>\nmelodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>\nmistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>\nthan 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>\ndo you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>\n5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>\nlong walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>\nstuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>\ndo you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>\na sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>\nheck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>\nsafer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>\ntrust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>\nbones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>\nI chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>\none.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>\nmonks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>\nthe wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>\na profanity.  So I come back from butchers block. <br/>\nFighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>\nfacing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>\nstone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>\nanthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>\ncasting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>\namong the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>\ncan&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>\ndungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>\nzone running :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n21rst song<br/>\nE Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
