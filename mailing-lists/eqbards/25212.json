Also - when I&#39;m in a group without<br/>\neither an enchanter or a shaman (but WITH a snarer was very common when I<br/>\nwas in a small guild without either) - and I&#39;m doing hastes and slows -<br/>\nthose are both singing songs - so I&#39;d use weaps regardless.  Point being -<br/>\neven if you do prefer insts over weaps - there are situations where you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe tanking and the better weaps you have in those situations you&#39;ll be in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as upgrading instruments; well I&#39;ve found that 90 pct of the time I&#39;m<br/>\nusing Drums and Lute.  At your level you are better off trying to camp your<br/>\nupgrades (7-String Lute in Hate and Naggy Drum - get your red scale before<br/>\nyou hit 53).  The Lute is No Drop - so you can&#39;t trade for one if you<br/>\nwant...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo again - as I said in my prior note - camp the Velious Armor, camp the<br/>\ninstrument upgrade, buy weapon upgrades.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 10:12 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Level 49 bard seeks equipment advice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot for the advice.. I asked mainly because I am unsure if keeping<br/>\nthe haste gloves are the most bang for the bucks considering the other gear<br/>\nI have.. Furthermore I often feel that my damage output with weapons really<br/>\ncant stack up with what I add to a group with my instruments. So improving<br/>\nmy own haste have never been _that_ important to me. Am I way off on the<br/>\nfeeling that improving haste isent a main issue for us bards?<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I considered trying to trade these gloves for are:<br/>\n- Better weapons<br/>\n- Better armor (singing steel BP *grin yeah right*)<br/>\n- Better instruments??<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Im still in doubt what will be the most bang for my bucks *shrug* Its<br/>\nthe first time I have had an item this valuable...<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to recap what I currently have:<br/>\nInstruments: Nostrolo tamborine, Mino horn,<br/>\nStorebought brass horn, Lute of<br/>\nthe Gypsy Princess<br/>\nPrimary Melee: Ykeshan War Club<br/>\nSecondary Melee: Short Sword of the Ykesha<br/>\nRanged Weapon: Runed Bone Fork<br/>\nEar: Opalline Earring<br/>\nEar: Opalline Earring<br/>\nNeck: Orc Fang Necklace<br/>\nFace: Mask of Deception<br/>\nHead: Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap (Dropped Version)<br/>\nOr Guardian helmet AC11 some stats<br/>\nShoulder: Tattered Mantle<br/>\nFinger: Silver Fire Emerald ring<br/>\nFinger: Silver Fire Emerald ring<br/>\nWrist: Lambent Bracers<br/>\nWrist: Lambent Bracers<br/>\nArm: Sleeves of the Ancients<br/>\nChest: Lambent Breastplate<br/>\nBack: Cloak of the Ice Bear<br/>\nFeet: Singing Steel Boots<br/>\nLegs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\nWaist: Thick leather apron/Troll hide belt<br/>\nHands: Singing Steel Gauntlets<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 17. juli 2001 16:28<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Level 49 bard seeks equipment advice<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; allakhazam lists this item at 18K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe 10K is more realistic.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FBSS is only haste and goes for 8K (average price)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This item has AC and +3 to **ALL** resists.  The<br/>\n&gt; resists make it a great item for dragon raids.<br/>\n&gt; (And for that reason you might want to just keep this<br/>\n&gt; item...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The item is rare at the moment and that may<br/>\n&gt; artifically increase the price.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>\n&gt; that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>\n&gt; any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>\n&gt; speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>\n&gt; posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>\n&gt; for that information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>\n&gt; song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tyunes Stratevarius<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 51 Songs<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*snipped my first mail*<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
