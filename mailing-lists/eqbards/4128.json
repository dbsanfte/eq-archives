I was doing songs and<br/>\nwaiting for a friend so I was there a bit.. This guy asked no less than 20<br/>\npeople and was there before I got there and after I left. The worst part is<br/>\nthat you could watch as he actually got a lot of stuff from people. (You<br/>\ncould see him put it on) I know people like to be nice, as do I, but what&#39;s<br/>\nthe point of this person playing the game?

You can give an item to a monster and if they get<br/>\nkilled, it&#39;s still on the body to recover? If so that&#39;s a completely<br/>\nfantastic idea and I&#39;ll start doing that immediately with all the rusty<br/>\nstuff I find and maybe the occasional tidbit. Thank you!!!! (No sarcasm<br/>\nwhat-so-ever, this is a really great idea!) By the way, if this actually<br/>\ndoes work - is there any kind of time limit as to how long it&#39;ll stay with<br/>\nthe monster?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
