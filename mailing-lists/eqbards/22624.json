The following changes were made:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum<br/>\nor below the minimum.<br/>\n- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of <br/>\nthe slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br/>\n- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified <br/>\nwhenever the volume slider was moved.<br/>\n- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association <br/>\nwith mipmapping.<br/>\n- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the <br/>\nwrong slot.<br/>\n- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those <br/>\ncarried by dwarves. <br/>\n- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of <br/>\nexperience in slight disagreement with the server.<br/>\n- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that <br/>\nwould do around one million points of damage if left to its <br/>\nown devices.<br/>\n- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable <br/>\nby anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up<br/>\nfollowing the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god <br/>\nof fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name<br/>\nif not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing <br/>\n&quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust hope they didn&#39;t mess with invis song and sneak/hide breakage.  <br/>\nIf anyone gets on(I didn&#39;t), let us know anything you discover.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
