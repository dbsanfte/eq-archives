I am posting some of<br/>\nmy discoveries as I find them to encourage people to explore them before they are too easy. I have<br/>\nalready posted about Fire Drakes in Lavastorm, Wisps in Eruds Crossing, Aqua Goblins in Ocean of<br/>\nTears and everything Kithicor (ALWAYS a good bet for mysterious adventure, there is a bizarre hidden<br/>\nstory in that woods, over on Crossroads of Norath/Discussions we have a little Kithicor fan club). I<br/>\nam not including loot and only the most important survival instructions so it will still be an<br/>\nadventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeerot: (12-15): Get bound in the Arena, take a boat (do NOT swim) to the entrance to Rathe<br/>\nMountains (notice the gypsies you can sell your loot to when you get overloaded in the Feerot,all<br/>\nthe loot in this zone is HEAVY) and go from temple to temple outside Cazic-Thule. Hop inside to ask<br/>\nif anyone wants to sell a Lizardscale cloak (&quot;trash loot&quot; on Rubicite carrying mob - AC 8, w 2.5, +5<br/>\ndex 60-75pp) but be prepared to die if you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAviak Village, Lake Rathe: 13-14: Get bound in the Arena, everyone there is waiting on the Aviak<br/>\nGuards, and the other Aviaks are free for the taking. there is a shop to the south at which you can<br/>\nsell.<br/>\n<br/>\nOasis(15+): Blue Camens and even blue crocs. Great exp but zero loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep posting these places as I find them. And I would love to hear anyone elses discoveries<br/>\nof areas that matched with their level well. I STILL have to go back to the Ocean of Tears and find<br/>\nmore, also I only quickly swung by the Barbarian Northlands and there is SO much to discover...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Scarlet Moon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
