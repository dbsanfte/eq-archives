I once<br/>\nmentioned the bard I grouped with who never played anything but Hymn<br/>\n(constantly, even when everyone was healed), Accelerando (of course), and<br/>\nBellow.  She only bellowed in battle, and you know... bellow is probably the<br/>\nleast effective of any of our battle songs.  Bellow gives that instant<br/>\ngratification, it&#39;s very noticeable... but really isn&#39;t that great.  She<br/>\nsaid &quot;bellow is the only one that works for me.&quot;  How innane!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I saw something tonight that truely shocked me.  I was literally<br/>\nspeechless.  Had damaged myself falling, and decided to heal up by the zone<br/>\na bit before heading on.  Targeted a bard a bit off, and saw he was quite<br/>\nhurt, noticed his con around level 18 or 19.  I realized he was sitting,<br/>\nsinging hymn.  I sauntered over and said, &quot;You know, that song would be much<br/>\nmore effective with an instrument.&quot;  He replied, &quot;Ya, but I don&#39;t like<br/>\ncarrying all that stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrying all that stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A bard who doesn&#39;t like carrying instruments???&quot;  And he just said, &quot;Yup.&quot;<br/>\nBut a mandolin weighs absolutely nothing!  But the songs are much more<br/>\neffective when played, singing them is like like like....  I couldn&#39;t say<br/>\nanything.  I just said, &quot;Looks like somebody picked the wrong class....&quot; and<br/>\nzoned in disgust!  Then crashed!  My client was agast too!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like a warrior saying he doesn&#39;t like wearing all that junk, or a mage<br/>\nsaying he doesn&#39;t like learning all that stuff.  Eeeesh... that has to be<br/>\nthe dumbest bard I&#39;ve ever seen.  One of those people who probably picked<br/>\nthe class to be a warrior with a personal SoW.  He gives all of us a BAD<br/>\nname, just pray he solos exclusively!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Solidarity bard brothers and sisters, we must educate the masses to our<br/>\n&gt;usefulness, especially our fellow bards like the one I ran into in Unrest<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Sunday.
