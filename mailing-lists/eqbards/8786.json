Its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage ratio is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have any stat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be found?  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only one I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got it...so any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ruldaas Riverdance </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
