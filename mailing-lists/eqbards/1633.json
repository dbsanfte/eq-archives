To auto-follow another<br/>\nplayer, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;.  You must be grouped with<br/>\nthe character in order to successfully carry out the command.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Changes<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Bard spell &quot;Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge&quot; will now require the use of Mana.<br/>\n- No spell or effect that accelerates the process of mana regeneration will<br/>\nwork on a Bard.<br/>\n- Tuyen&#39;s Songs now have range.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now that 38,43 and 46 are apparently working, any of you high level<br/>\nbards have<br/>\nthe straight poop on them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular what&#39;s your take on Dirge?  How does the damage it does<br/>\ncompare<br/>\nwith the best damage song we have before then?  Looks like they made sure<br/>\nit would be used only once in a long while, is it powerful enough to even<br/>\nhave memorized?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard 400+ dmg, how does that compare to other casters DD/AOE spells at<br/>\nthat<br/>\nlevel?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that the two Tuyen&#39;s have a range, does anyone have numbers on them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen the Curious bard of Povar &lt;g&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
