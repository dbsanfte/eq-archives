Had a good laugh last nite.  actually saw 2 different groups<br/>\n/auctioning in S Karana for tanks.  One group went so far as to offer double<br/>\nlooting for any tank that would join them.  They were still auctioning an<br/>\nhour and a half later.  Still think people aren&#39;t bolting from tanks to<br/>\nbinders?
