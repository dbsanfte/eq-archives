Level difference also affects how much damage you take when you get hit and how able you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-91072834\">The main factor in sticking a song (or spell) is level difference.  Level<br/>\ndifference also affects how much damage you take when you get hit and how<br/>\nable you are to endure it (ie you have more hp at higher levels and probably<br/>\nbetter armor.)  So, you want to factor those things in when you engage in<br/>\ncombat. To my thinking, the risk/reward ratio is too flat.  Killing reds<br/>\ndoes not reward you for your risk.  Killing blues has much return on time<br/>\ninvested.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. In NK, it seems that killing griffawns helps increase the chance of<br/>\ngriffeene (also griffon & GrimFeather too perhaps).  There is a spot near<br/>\nthe named Treant where fawns and feenes seem to spawn.  Look for a tower<br/>\nthing and they spawn near there. Kill kill kill.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I did not have luck charming stuff until level 35 or so.  Partly due to<br/>\nsome bad experiences early on and not really learning how - so I quit<br/>\ndieing - err trying - well both.  Eventually, I learned to keep Selos going,<br/>\nto charm, attack then run away.  Charm, run, rinse repeat.  Also, I learned<br/>\nto zone a bad pull.  Also, learned /w all cleric 30 50 and /tell hello, are<br/>\nyou busy?<br/>\n<br/>\nRathe Mts has some strange pathing problems.  The clops near the lake zone<br/>\nare probably easier to deal with and the zone is close by.  Whereas the clop<br/>\nnear the hg&#39;s are further from the zone, nearer to more stuff that will agro<br/>\n(hg&#39;s), and that area has some bad pathing issues (and mobs that will<br/>\nteleport to you when the pathing is bad).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion for level 27 is to try some Clops near the lake zone and be<br/>\nready to run.  Also, I&#39;d think that rooks and harriers in SK would be good -<br/>\nand lots of wide open spaces to run around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Choon vs Froon  seems to be a Bardic rite of passage.  If you have a<br/>\nhelper with SoW or Selos, things will go much better the first few times.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 24, 2000 10:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Charming Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well spent most of my time this weekend trying to get Charm fighting<br/>\ndown with Griffawns and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Griffenes in NK. I have a couple of questions:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. I noticed (and assume) that killing Griffawns got the Griffenes to<br/>\nspawn. Are they like Cyclops<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the Rather Mtn&#39;s were you have to basically kill everything (bears,<br/>\netc) to get more to spawn?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.

Do I have a reasonable shot and charm fighting<br/>\nthese 2 against each other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These 2 were my very first experiment the moment I got the song at level<br/>\n27 (after trying for 10 minutes<br/>\n&gt; to get some help to take them out I was just curious if I could get it to<br/>\nstick and was very surprised<br/>\n&gt; when it did).  Took awhile to finish off the winner, but it fun and I got<br/>\nmy lambent vambraces and boots<br/>\n&gt; out of the deal.
