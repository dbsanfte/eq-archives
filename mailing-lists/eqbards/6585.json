I had the fortune to kill one while camping in the courtyard.<br/>\nSomeone pulled a train from the basement that included a bunch of nasty<br/>\nstuff.  My group watched it run by while sitting along the wall.  The train<br/>\nheaded to the zone chasing the party that started it.  The Lesser Blade<br/>\nFiend was at the end of the train.  Our party attacked it and killed it with<br/>\nrelative ease.  It is one of the coolest looking monsters I have seen in the<br/>\ngame.  It looks like an air elemental with several swords that swirl around<br/>\nand around.  Imagine an invisble cuisinart and you get the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>\n&gt; told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; anyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?  Who knows the<br/>\n&gt; mysterious secret of the origin of the Pugius Dagger?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
