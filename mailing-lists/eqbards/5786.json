Our necromancer keeps getting more and more int, but she is<br/>\nstill stuck with only (hehe, only) 2000 mana (after much testing). So i<br/>\ncould play the song but it wouldnt help her total mana... so to me the song<br/>\nis completly useless. This is all feedback from the casters, i cant<br/>\nactually determine this myself obviously. <br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 bard of Tunare<br/>\nand the newly minted Enoch, lvl 19 necro :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Seems I&#39;m arguing about this everywhere I go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;People have this mistaken assumption that more mana = more<br/>\n&gt;spells.  That is not the case.  The amount of mana a caster<br/>\n&gt;has determines the number of spells he can cast without<br/>\n&gt;resting/meditating.  The mana regeneration rate determines how<br/>\n&gt;many spells he can cast over a given period of time.  You can<br/>\n&gt;have 100 mana or 1000 mana, if your mana regeneration rate is<br/>\n&gt;unchanged you will still cast the same number of spells/hour. <br/>\n&gt;Thus, more mana is advantageous in a single fight; it is not<br/>\n&gt;advantageous over the long term (if you use that advantage in <br/>\n&gt;a single fight, you pay for it with longer downtime).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;e.g.  Your party tries to take and hold a room.  The cleric<br/>\n&gt;has 500 mana.  You attack and are only able to clear the first<br/>\n&gt;half of the room before the cleric is out of mana and must<br/>\n&gt;meditate.  The cleric meditates.  By the time he is at full<br/>\n&gt;mana, the portion of the room you&#39;ve cleared has respawned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The typical reaction to this type of scenario is &quot;damn, we<br/>\n&gt;could&#39;ve done it if we&#39;d only had more mana.&quot;  This is not so.<br/>\n&gt;Say the cleric had 1000 mana.  You attack and are able to<br/>\n&gt;clear the entire room, with the cleric finishing OOM.  The<br/>\n&gt;cleric meditates.  By the time he is at 500 mana, the entire<br/>\n&gt;room has respawned, and now the scenario is identical to the<br/>\n&gt;previous.  More mana lets you take the room once where you<br/>\n&gt;could not before (single fight), but it does not enable you to<br/>\n&gt;hold the room (long term).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>\n&gt;situation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>\n&gt;Start singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>\n&gt;the fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>\n&gt;in for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>\n&gt;spells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>\n&gt;the effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>\n&gt;advantageous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
