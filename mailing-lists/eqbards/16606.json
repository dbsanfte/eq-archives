There are bards<br/>\nthoughout history that have built into our collective minds the power and<br/>\ncharacter of the bard. I would think it would be nice to have some of THOSE<br/>\nabilites.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. I like the Pied Piper idea. And it IS practical in a way. Imagine<br/>\npulling a small mob away to an area suitable for mesmerization and general<br/>\nextermination. Or pulling a group off a poor, poor caster beleagered by<br/>\ncreatures the tank could slap into submission (if they could get to them).<br/>\nCombined with a memory wipe, that song alone would have none bards crying<br/>\nabout the bards power being to high.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Everyone seems to be debating on the merits of invisibility to undead,<br/>\nwhether we have it or not, do we want it or not, etc. Perhaps a song or two<br/>\nthat deal strictly with undead would not be uncalled for. Imagine a song of<br/>\nLife that lowers the aggro range of undead to zero or allows them to realize<br/>\nthey are dead and, in their despair over their pathetic existence, set them<br/>\nto attacking each other instead of living players. Wouldn&#39;t that be a sight?<br/>\nIt could even require a special type of strings (my, my, could all those<br/>\nvarious packs of strings and instrument bodies scattered thought the game<br/>\nbecome USEFUL?).  Silver strings for instruments that affect the undead.<br/>\nSeveral bards utilized silver strings for just that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3.  Songs of Youth could do nothing but make the creatures forget how old<br/>\nthey are. Useful? Ummm, perhaps not. Then again, if they forget all they&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned for the last five levels, that could turn a level 50 into a level 45<br/>\nor a level 65 into a level 60, thus making it easier to remove from the<br/>\nparty&#39;s path.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4.  Songs of the Season.  Spring could regenerate, heal, remove the effects<br/>\nof spells for a growing.  Summer could reduce all cold based damage and<br/>\nability to cast cold to minimal use.  Fall,  the slowdown of creatures with<br/>\nthe snare of leaves, the interuption of casters by wandering thoughts.<br/>\nWinter, The opposite of Summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5.  The Song of  the Path.  If cast soon enough and with enough time, leads<br/>\nthe soul back to the body much like the clerics reserect does. The main<br/>\ndifference would be the amount of time it would take (perhaps a minute of<br/>\nreal time) and how soon it needs to be cast. Perhaps it would need to be<br/>\nsung within 10 minutes, before the spirit gets to far away.  That would make<br/>\nan interesting delinma. Do they reserect a fallen player and quit party<br/>\nsupport or let them go until a cleric can spare the mana? This would not be<br/>\na general replacement for the cleric spell, only a limited copy.<br/>\n<br/>\n 6.  Song of Material.  A song whose only purpose is to make things more<br/>\nlike what they are. (What?) Shields are more shieldlike, swords are more<br/>\nswordlike, armor...well, I&#39;m sure you get the drift. It could add an<br/>\nadditional 3 or 4 points to all item stats. A weapon goes from damage 12 to<br/>\ndamage 15. A breastplate goes from 22 to 25.  It would make items that proc<br/>\nwant to proc more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, these are just off the top of my head. I&#39;m sure similar songs<br/>\nhave been discussed before and tossed away. With all the discussion, I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming the main songs bards seem to want are binding and invis to undead.<br/>\nPerhaps when I am higher, they will be the only songs I will feel we are<br/>\nmissing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
