I guess I just have gotten tired of<br/>\nbeing lied to by Verant.  &quot;Oh yes we test thoroughly, even for bards&quot;  Yet,<br/>\nit takes not 2 minutes to prove that the change they put in for Sonorous<br/>\nClouding does not work.  How can the person who is supposed to be the font<br/>\nof all knowledge for spells not know how they work?  And if he doesn&#39;t, why<br/>\ndidn&#39;t he bother to take the time to find out?  Its not like this was an off<br/>\nthe cuff post to a board at random.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean seriously.  What purpose is served by answering our questions if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t take the time to give the correct answers?  If all they do is tell us<br/>\nhow something is supposed to work without ever bothering to check and see if<br/>\nmaybe they made a mistake and it doesn&#39;t work the way they think it does,<br/>\nwhat good does it do?  Its not like this is an isolated incident.  If any<br/>\nother entertainment venture repeatedly insulted your intelligence, lied to<br/>\nyou, and refused to address mistakes, would you still support it?  I doubt<br/>\nit.  The NFL is a good example.  The NFL is pretty cool entertainment-wise.<br/>\nWould I think so if my representative team was the Cincinnati Bengals?  No,<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be interested any more then either.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Joshua R.

Wind instruments have no effect on the MR<br/>\nDebuff of Pixie Strike.  This is a fact known by anyone who has sung Pixie<br/>\nwith a flute equipped.
