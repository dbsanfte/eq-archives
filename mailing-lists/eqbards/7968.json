He just asked me<br/>\nto keep singing my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him<br/>\nfor several hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this<br/>\nhe said he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I<br/>\nneeded exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me<br/>\nand initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he<br/>\nsaid yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a<br/>\npair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could<br/>\nsee via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good<br/>\nfor my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I<br/>\nshould wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>\ntwinking but dont want to be called a cheat.
