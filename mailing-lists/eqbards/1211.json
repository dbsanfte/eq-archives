For the levels infered, <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;assume Upper Guk was meant. If you have hunted the live frogluks in Upper<br/>\n&gt;Guk and have gotten bad factions with them, you now have a real problem<br/>\n&gt;getting into Lower Guk at higher levels. You must cross Upper Guk to access<br/>\n&gt;lower Guk for the undead frogluks (and all the really cool goodies down<br/>\n&gt;there, like did you ever want to be a dark elf bard?) once you get into the<br/>\n&gt;30&#39;s levels.<br/>\n&gt;Our take on upper guk is that it was intented as a evil races dungeon<br/>\n&gt;primarily since they are born with bad live frogluk factions. A person in<br/>\n&gt;our guild has that problem and he has to get someone to invis him to get in<br/>\n&gt;and out, everytime. This sounds simple til you start counting deaths also.<br/>\n&gt;The only people who must kill live frogs are the hapless paladins, if they<br/>\n&gt;want to get one of their holy swords, the Ghoulsbane. How do I know this? <br/>\n&gt;My<br/>\n&gt;husband is a L40+ paladin and lives in lower Guk after painstakingly<br/>\n&gt;doctoring his factions thru getting a ghoulsbane. I do see others in game<br/>\n&gt;hunting there and the few I have talked to had no idea that lower guk<br/>\n&gt;existed. This is so far the only split dungeon we have found. So think very<br/>\n&gt;hard before you hunt upper guk.<br/>\n&gt;Brilinnia on Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Solusek&#39;s Eye is also a split dungeon, because the two zones were <br/>\ncalled solusekA and solusekB. I thik Verant recently renamed B to something <br/>\nelse (I forget). Everyone thought it was a brand new zone, but it was just a <br/>\nname change on an old zone. SolusekB is supposed to be pretty much like <br/>\nLower Guk as far as difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
