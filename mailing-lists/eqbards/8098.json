If my fatigue bar gets to 1/2, it&#39;s pretty certain that the tanks <br/>\nare down, also, and I really don&#39;t want to suffer the speed penalties of group <br/>\nfatigue in an extended fight, so I twist it in for awhile.  Even in other <br/>\ncircumstances, I will swap Jig in during downtime between fights if requested.  <br/>\nWhy not, if it makes people feel better.  I don&#39;t think that we require all <br/>\neight slots to be full of precisely the right songs in order to win fights, and <br/>\nI&#39;ve never died thinking to myself &quot;if only I had song X memorized, I would have <br/>\nlived&quot;.  I&#39;ve died for 100 other reasons (at least)!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your second point, I *always* tell other people how to play their <br/>\ncharacters, especially if they are unused to Bards.  I&#39;ve died FAR more often <br/>\nfrom other player&#39;s lack of playing sophistication than from having the Jig <br/>\nmemorized.  I do try to make my instruction impersonal and non-judgemental, but <br/>\nI would be a fool to assume that other players know what they&#39;re doing.  <br/>\n(Actually, I&#39;ve been that fool many times over, I just finally learned the <br/>\nlesson.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, if they are NOT being impersonal and non-judgemental, I DO leave.  Even <br/>\nif they are mistaken in thinking that I&#39;m an idiot (I leave that to others to <br/>\njudge), I don&#39;t want to fight with a group that believes that that is the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
