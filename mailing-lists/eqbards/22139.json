I&#39;ve seen lots o singing steel<br/>\ndisappear this way too but now am keeping track!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a sad note, Tani is all of a sudden dying in 30 :(  Died twice *pouts*...<br/>\nthose mobs in Frontier Mountains are MEAN!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice on weapons :) I&#39;ll work my way towards those!<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 57th !!!!!!!!!!!!

The spine I am <br/>\n&gt; not familiar<br/>\n&gt; with, the Walking Stick I have and use because I like the <br/>\n&gt; effect message:<br/>\n&gt; &#39;somemob01 glances nervously about&#39; (tashan). The &#39;claw <br/>\n&gt; thing&#39; sounds like<br/>\n&gt; Sainey&#39;s Claw which I also have and use because it adds 10 <br/>\n&gt; AC.  Some next<br/>\n&gt; step bard weaps are: Sionache&#39;s Partisan 9/19 piercing, <br/>\n&gt; Symphonic Saber 11<br/>\n&gt; 23 with the effect that lowers you on the hate list.  Jade <br/>\n&gt; mace 9 18 is good<br/>\n&gt; too but maybe a bit harder to get as they are usable by other classes.<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Dagger is 10 21 - awesome.  breath of Harmony 10 18 <br/>\n&gt; effect: Niv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Preservation - uber.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All of these weps are normally obtain by level 50+ groups in <br/>\n&gt; the Kunark<br/>\n&gt; Dungeons.  The bard only ones tend to get traded off or passed down.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 17, 2000 12:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Suggestions for a Level 30<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious on weapons too..
