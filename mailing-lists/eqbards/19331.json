How do you get around the problem where the<br/>\ntarget is faster than your charm&#39;s melee and you have to take a hit<br/>\nbefore your charm can start the combat?  It&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;m<br/>\nnot soloing the giant camp in Frontier Mtns right now.  I can get one<br/>\ncharmed and sic it on a second but when the charm breaks and I have to<br/>\nrecharm my thrall the other giant gets far enough away that I have to<br/>\ntake a hit (ouch) to keep it in place long enough for my pet to hit it.<br/>\nAm I doing something wrong or should I start mixing in chains on the<br/>\ntarget or what?  Aanndd.. at best (w/o cha bracers and lambent) my<br/>\ncharisma tops out at 133, that&#39;s with 2x cha rings, 1 lambent bracer, 1<br/>\nlambent gauntlet, +9cha neck and +13 from my MoD (yea yea, i didn&#39;t<br/>\nallocate any cha at start...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kevin L.
