I would just like<br/>\nto say that you have to be carefull with files that you dovnload because<br/>\nthere are new versions of Backorifice (I think that Backorifice 2000 is the<br/>\nlatest) and netbus. This new versions can&#39;t be decetded by some older<br/>\nantivirus programes so if you aren&#39;t sure if your antivirus can detect them<br/>\ndownload bodetect and netbus detector from internet.

You might want to make sure you don&#39;t have a crackable password.<br/>\n&gt; Where I work, we had a hacker problem and we were told to use a<br/>\ncombination of<br/>\n&gt; letters and numbers, and not to use a common name, or any variation of our<br/>\n&gt; name or userid&#39;s in the password.

Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Monday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Norrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out for a run.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Strange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;maybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Strange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;park here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Even stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>\n&gt; &gt;growing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Oh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Immediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enter the world as my wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Same routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Freeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;disappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>\n&gt; &gt;outside of this room.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not on both my main characters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;explanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;consent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;persons unknown.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;provided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;promptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>\n&gt; &gt;killing the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;money, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;account was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;demonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;game.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>\n&gt; &gt;continues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for tonight at least.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Freeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;explain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Saldara<br/>\n&gt; &gt;High Elf Wizard (21), Mith Marr server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Melaniel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
