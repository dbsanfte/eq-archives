Which is<br/>\n  perfect for a party of low 20s.  While the preacher drops some<br/>\n  nice things, you won&#39;t find a war axe or icy legs here.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That area is beyond the two gates past the flag room.  In<br/>\n  the King Throne room, you&#39;ll find most goblins are L20-25,<br/>\n  the elites L25-L30, and the named goblins are L27-L33, where<br/>\n  King Thex&#39;Ka IV is the highest (hits for double 70).<br/>\n<br/>\n  The elite goblins will drop the icy greaves, and the elite<br/>\n  honor guard will drop the silvery war axes 1h/2h.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This area requires a minimum L25 full group to tackle effectively.<br/>\n  And even then, it&#39;s definitely a challenge until you are <br/>\n  around L35.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope this helps, and maybe answered some questions, maybe =)<br/>\n  Then again, I could have read your post all wrong.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
