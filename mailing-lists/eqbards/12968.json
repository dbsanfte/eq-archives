This bard was possibly the worst one I&#39;ve ever<br/>\nseen.  She played Bellow during fights.  That was IT most of the time,<br/>\nexcept when she played Lullaby.  When there was only one mob.  I rarely even<br/>\nsaw Hymn being played between fights.  Her group had mostly meleers as well.<br/>\nDuring the couple hours I was there soloing, I seemed to get an awful lot of<br/>\nkills.  I&#39;m almost glad she didn&#39;t know what she was doing, because they<br/>\ncould have prevented me from getting any, if she was capable. :)  I&#39;m not an<br/>\nexpert, but it still made me wince.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gaelaian Galaenor, bard of the perpetual 22nd, Tunare.<br/>\n-Raean Bloodyhands, monk of the 23rd pummelling, Tunare. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
