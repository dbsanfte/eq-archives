Own DEX<br/>\nboosting items? Naw.....) Actually, I dumped as many of my starting points<br/>\ninto DEX as I could, and then added 2 Cutthroat Rings, Snakeskin Gloves, and<br/>\na Dragoon Dirk....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat skills are made better by high DEX? Does this affect my AC any? (I<br/>\nwondered if it did though, because I bought 2 Brass Earrings, rated at 2AC<br/>\neach, and when I put them on, they actually gave me a total of 7AC<br/>\nincrease...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI beleive that I read somewhere that Mana for Bard&#39;s is DEX/CHA based...Is<br/>\nthis correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLueln<br/>\n10th Rank<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
