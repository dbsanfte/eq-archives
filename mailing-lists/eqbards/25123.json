I&#39;m just starting the quest, so not much help with<br/>\nthe instrument question. But glad to see another Bard epic on Xegony.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question for you though, did you get the scales from Naggy and Vox?<br/>\nI&#39;m really tired of waiting for those raids (most of my guild is above or<br/>\nbelow the caps) but I hear the alternates like Gore are near impossible.<br/>\nI&#39;m kissing 52 and just want to keep trucking to 55 without worrying about<br/>\nthe darn scales!<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\nThe Commune, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Rebecca Small &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finally done with my epic!

I do have a<br/>\nquestion that I have not seen a clear answer on: is the epic as powerful<br/>\nas<br/>\nall our best instruments or stronger in string, lesser in percussion?
