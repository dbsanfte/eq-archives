Either nobody understands /assist, they don&#39;t trust my<br/>\nlullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one nightmarish pull<br/>\n(&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of Oasis) in which I died<br/>\nbecause nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the virtual chalkboard<br/>\nand went though it step-by-step:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I type MEZ<br/>\n2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>\n3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>\n4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound on me between naps<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>\neverybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It was<br/>\nlate so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>\nsituation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>\nconvinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out of there if<br/>\nI don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>\ncause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>\ngraduating to more mature groups where satisfaction comes from watching a<br/>\ngood plan come together, rather than marvelling that we didn&#39;t die when we<br/>\ndeserved to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro of the 17th Song<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Who decided that non-SoW&#39;d trolls make good pullers? The ten minutes<br/>\nours was away selling I pulled and we killed twice as many mobs with little<br/>\ndowntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 28, 1999 1:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Newbie questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This simple tactic seems to be the hardest think for hybrid tanks to<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n&gt; I have seen even mid 30&#39;s (typically in HK where it is after all &quot;safe&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t have to be really skilled to survive) not follow this really<br/>\n&gt; simple yet effective proceedure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It works!
