I do like the non-crowded<br/>\naspect of weekdays - but I SHOULD be doing programming work (as I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen making as much in the music biz as I used to &lt;sigh&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Time of day:<br/>\n        see above<br/>\n<br/>\n Longest stretch of continuous play:<br/>\n        about 12 on a weekend a couple of times<br/>\n<br/>\n Way to have game sounds:<br/>\n<br/>\n        Pretty low - but maybe lowder now that I got those SB-Live tips.<br/>\nHad to keep it low when I first got the games &#39;cause my two cats freaked at<br/>\nthe Spider sounds - but they&#39;re used to it now<br/>\n<br/>\n Distance to sit from display:<br/>\n<br/>\n       Hehe grabbed my tape measure 26.5 inches (21&quot; monitor baby!)<br/>\n<br/>\n TV show to have on:<br/>\n<br/>\n       I almost always have TV on - anything heavily dialog based so I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to worry about looking at it.  I&#39;d say &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot; on HBO has<br/>\nto be the best..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Music to listen to:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Been listening to a lot of James Brown these days - but I&#39;m mostly a<br/>\njazz guy and listen to a lot Classical.<br/>\n  Berlioz Symphony Fantastique would be pretty cool  in Unrest<br/>\n<br/>\n Beverage (non-alcoholic):<br/>\n<br/>\n    Diet Coke and LOTS of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n Beverage (alcoholic):<br/>\n     When I&#39;m out drinking (and on gigs) I prefer Vodka-Tonics (Ketel One or<br/>\nSkye preferably).  But I don&#39;t drink much at home.  I used to drink beer at<br/>\nhome - but my taste for beer has diminshed substantially after I made the<br/>\nmistake of spending a month in Europe.  Even microbrews are pretty mediocre<br/>\nin comparison.  And exported brew - why do they have to put the &quot;suck&quot; in it<br/>\nbefore shipping it to the USA?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Health Food:<br/>\n<br/>\n    The closest I get to health food is the baked potato chips they sell at<br/>\nthe &quot;Healthy&quot; Grocery stores.
