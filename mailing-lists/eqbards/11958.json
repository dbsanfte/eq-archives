So, once you get<br/>\nhim - should be no trouble.  That being said - look out for them other SG&#39;s.<br/>\nUgh - con blue to me at 38 but sheesh they hit really hard and have some<br/>\nhigh MR (resists me - ugh)  And on top of all that - they can teleport to<br/>\nyou.  Yes, stinking things will get &quot;stuck&quot; on dunes or whatever and the<br/>\nanti-safe zoning code will teleport them to you.  I died in my current level<br/>\ncuz of just that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMe 38 bard, a 32ish bard and 34ish necro tried to kill one.  Other bard<br/>\ndied, I was under a bub and carefully running for Oasis thinking I got it<br/>\nmade cuz Habib is clear across the zone when whammo! You have been slain...<br/>\n(tried to use my squad ring but think it did not fire becuz selos was up)<br/>\nGrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow had I been smarter - I woulda conned him and determined he was not the<br/>\none I wanted (although I am not sure I am gonna see a green SG quite yet -<br/>\nmaybe) and if he was not the one - just let the DE Smiths take care of him.<br/>\nHe is pathed close to them and they will kill him pretty easily.  Then wait<br/>\nby the Derv camp for the next spawn. I waited around one day for like 3<br/>\nspawns and did not see the Kiliji SG (supposedly his id is &quot;sand giant&quot;<br/>\ninstead of &quot;a sand giant&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow why the heck am I doing this in the first place???  Well, a young bard<br/>\nin my guild wants one really bad so... I am helping.  But you would be<br/>\nbetter off going to Permafrost and trying to get into a group doing the King<br/>\nroom - get yourself a Crystaline Blade - much better than Kiliji (wt 8 is a<br/>\nhvy beast) or getting a Silvery War Axe - prolly better.  But still I think<br/>\nthe Staff of Writhing is the best damage application tool for bards in their<br/>\n30&#39;s - and yes I am still looking for a Obsidian Shard but use my Dragoon<br/>\nDirk while I look.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. some guy said he got one in 2 hours of camp time. also when you are<br/>\nthere look out for the Ancient Cyclops - if you have helpers that would a be<br/>\na very rare spawn and he has jbootie stuff - I think??  But more importantly<br/>\n- the Terrorantula spawns in that zone - look out for that beast - he will<br/>\ngive a full party of mid 30&#39;s a real good fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tedwardscanni [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edwardscanni@...\">edwardscanni@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, December 16, 1999 12:39 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Time for a new weapon<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;edwardscanni&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edwardscanni@...\">edwardscanni@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell I think I am getting tired of my measly well balanced<br/>\nlong sword,and I<br/>\n\t\tthink its time for a new slasher :)<br/>\n\t\tI was thinking of the Brazen Brass Kilij and was<br/>\nwondering-how common is the<br/>\n\t\tsand giant with the plans for this quest-is he camped?<br/>\n\t\tCan he be camped?<br/>\n\t\tI hate to say, I have been in high keep so long,I forget<br/>\nwhat the rest of<br/>\n\t\tthe world is like(blinks in the sunlight as he steps outside<br/>\nthe keep).<br/>\n\t\tI never really hunted much in Ro-went to Guk for the first<br/>\ntime last<br/>\n\t\teek( pretty sad for my level)-never been to CT,or MM.
