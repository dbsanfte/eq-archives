Late<br/>\n30&#39;s/lo 40&#39;s I wanted more damage and figured out Obsidian Shard with 30dd<br/>\nproc is off had wield-able so I set forth trying to get one.  I was with a<br/>\ngroup (later to become my guild) and turned down a runed falchion.  They<br/>\nmust have been kinda astounded when I told them my StoW and Obsid Shard is<br/>\nbetter than RF and whatever in off hand.  Heh, some 40 minutes later they<br/>\nported me off some where and presented me with an Obsidan Shard. I presume<br/>\nthey did some trading with the RF or whatever.  That was a good combo for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nLo to mid 40&#39;s I became 2YK compliant.  In my 47/48 merry go round, I got a<br/>\nFlowing Black Silk Sash and became rather dangerous (to myself anyways heh.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo something obtainable for you might be a Staff of Writhing (75dd proc) -<br/>\nuse with dragoon dirk until you can get an obsidian shard (30dd proc).<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Melaniel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@...\">everquest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 13, 2000 11:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Girls just wanna have fun .....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Melaniel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@...\">everquest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nope, not a cue for a bad song, but a combat question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now they&#39;re all fast weapons and very light so I can fight all day<br/>\n&gt; with barely a pause.  But also low damage, a 12 here, a 16 there, and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s it.  So maybe I should be looking to improve on them, to give<br/>\n&gt; me a feeling I&#39;m doing more than nibbling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m hoping to hear from everyone else what weapons you are using,<br/>\n&gt; and how you feel they compare to what I&#39;ve got and to what other<br/>\n&gt; supposed (phooey!) hybrids are doing. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
