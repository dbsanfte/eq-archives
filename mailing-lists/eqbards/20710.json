I think it is<br/>\nbecause the game itself requires so much logistics discussion. Logistics can<br/>\nbe diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data much less gussying it<br/>\nup, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends to sound pretty OOC.<br/>\nGuildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there is no premise at all of<br/>\nsharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location. How do you RP for more<br/>\nthan a short span when one person is in the Field of bone as an Iksar and<br/>\nanother in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>\nplayer to quit playing a secondary and come help... Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>\npossible to counter the effect, just that it is hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
