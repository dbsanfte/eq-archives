Namely, A Druid, A<br/>\n&gt; Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>\n&gt; and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have<br/>\n&gt; had a problem that I as a<br/>\n&gt; bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt<br/>\n&gt; Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>\n&gt; once I would be the one ending battle with most of<br/>\n&gt; my health, while my<br/>\n&gt; partner was near death.  This is nice but<br/>\n&gt; unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>\n&gt; would have a terrible time trying to get my share of<br/>\n&gt; dammage.  I think that<br/>\n&gt; some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a<br/>\n&gt; lot of resists from<br/>\n&gt; Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I<br/>\n&gt; think that there is some<br/>\n&gt; other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a seperate note,  I did group with 2 other bards<br/>\n&gt; in unrest once.  WOW...<br/>\n&gt; that was cool, and I can attribute not getting all<br/>\n&gt; the attention, due to<br/>\n&gt; multiple bards.  What fun.  If we had one more bard<br/>\n&gt; we could have been the<br/>\n&gt; Beatles :)  I also dont think I have ever seen Sooo<br/>\n&gt; many icons for Buffs on<br/>\n&gt; my screen :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sevin Tercet 20th Human Bard<br/>\n&gt; on Brell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 23, 1999 11:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] The surefire way for a bard to<br/>\n&gt; avoid being a mobs<br/>\n&gt; main target<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night, at the suggestion of a few people from<br/>\n&gt; this list, I ventured for<br/>\n&gt; the first time to South Karana to hunt aviaks.  I<br/>\n&gt; had been in South Karana<br/>\n&gt; before to complete the Qeynos bard quest but had<br/>\n&gt; never fought anything<br/>\n&gt; there.  I joined a group that consisted of five 28th<br/>\n&gt; level players, four of<br/>\n&gt; which were casters.  The fifth person was a 28th<br/>\n&gt; level bard (Cherlas).  To<br/>\n&gt; avoid overlapping songs in combat, we agreed that<br/>\n&gt; she would sing the level<br/>\n&gt; 25-28 songs while I would sing anthem, chain, and<br/>\n&gt; anything else appropriate.<br/>\n&gt; We were camping at the top of the village where<br/>\n&gt; avocets, harriers, rooks,<br/>\n&gt; and darters all spawn (very quickly).  I fought with<br/>\n&gt; this group for almost<br/>\n&gt; two hours.  Me and the other bard were the default<br/>\n&gt; tanks.  For the first<br/>\n&gt; time in a long time, I was no longer the center of<br/>\n&gt; attention.  In almost<br/>\n&gt; every fight, the 28th level bard would pull and get<br/>\n&gt; the aviaks initial<br/>\n&gt; attention.  When one of the casters unloaded on the<br/>\n&gt; aviak, they often found<br/>\n&gt; themselves the center of attention.  I, on the other<br/>\n&gt; hand, almost never got<br/>\n&gt; attacked the entire night.  The most health I ever<br/>\n&gt; dropped to was about 50%.<br/>\n&gt; This happened when an avocet spawned while we were<br/>\n&gt; in the process of<br/>\n&gt; fighting a rook and a harrier.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Moral of the story: Two bards in a group can be lots<br/>\n&gt; of fun.  The lower<br/>\n&gt; level bard also has the luxury of not having to<br/>\n&gt; worry too much about getting<br/>\n&gt; continually whacked on.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 23 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends-<br/>\n&gt; send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
