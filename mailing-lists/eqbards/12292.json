Too many people in a zone and you sit around bored because there aren t enough mobs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1595172251\">I think there is an inherent Catch-22 in the way Verant designed the game.<br/>\nToo many people in a zone and you sit around bored because there aren&#39;t<br/>\nenough mobs to go around for everyone.  Not enough people in the zone and<br/>\nits not safe to go very deep inside due to increase chances of starting a<br/>\ntrain.  Case in point was my party in Mistmoore the other night.  Zone<br/>\nconsisted of three low 20s parties camping the lake area, one party in the<br/>\ngraveyard, and my party in the courtyard.  Around 20-25 players total in the<br/>\nzone.  My party consisted of 46 warrior, 40 cleric, 39 paladin, 39 druid, 36<br/>\nmonk and 30 bard (me).  We were all in the same guild and sole purpose was<br/>\nto get a piece of granite from a gargoyle for the paladin (armor quest).  I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t getting any experience due to the 46 warrior but wasn&#39;t worried about<br/>\nit.  Had the entire courtyard to ourselves but could never get a good handle<br/>\non it.  By the time we cleared out the courtyard and medded up, it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsafe to try a pull from the castle because the mobs in the courtyard we<br/>\nkilled first were due to respawn shortly.  A couple of times we tried<br/>\npulling from the castle and ended up starting a train.  This was primarily<br/>\ndue to the feign death nerf.  Everytime the monk tried to get a single pull<br/>\nhe ended up getting multiple mobs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be nice is if the spawn rate in a zone scaled based on zone<br/>\npopulation.  Using MM the other night as an example, the mobs around the<br/>\nlake would spawn quicker since there were more low 20s groups camping them.<br/>\nIn the courtyard, the mob spawn rate slows down since there is only one<br/>\nparty camping them.  Not certain how this would be programmed but if it is<br/>\nfeasible it would help advance the dungeon crawl method of adventuring in<br/>\nthe zones wih a small number of people in them.  As it stands, there doesn&#39;t<br/>\nappear to be anyway to go deep inside Mistmoore unless there are several<br/>\ngroups all working together.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On another note, does anyone have any advice for pulling in MM or a good<br/>\n&gt; place to camp?  I was wiped 3 times there last night alone from really bad<br/>\n&gt; ugly looking trains that seemed to include the WHOLE castle, all of them<br/>\n&gt; coming out through the graveyard (which I had imagined would be safer).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, Prexus has officially grown up I think.  1700 people on it last night<br/>\n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to hunt in Sol B or in Lower Guk (EVERYTHING<br/>\n&gt; was camped)... But when I got to MM, there were only about 12 people in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; zone... now I know why.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
