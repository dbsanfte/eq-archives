They have come up with some formulas that<br/>\n&gt; explain much of the hell level and hell level +1 effects.  Based on their<br/>\n&gt; formulas (which are only a guess) I think the difference in experience loss<br/>\n&gt; can be explained.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; lvl, exp needed, exp lost  (examples made up)<br/>\n&gt; --------------------<br/>\n&gt; lvl 29    5000    500<br/>\n&gt; lvl 30    10000   500<br/>\n&gt; lvl 31    2500    500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you can see, the experience lost is linear, while the exp needed for hell<br/>\n&gt; level takes a big jump, and there is a dip afterwards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A death at 29 costs you half a bubble.<br/>\n&gt; A death at 30 costs you a quarter of a bubble.<br/>\n&gt; A death at 31 costs you a full bubble.<br/>\n&gt; But the total experience loss is the same in each case.<br/>\n&gt; (based on the made of example above)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since experience for HL+1 is so much less than HL, the same amount of<br/>\n&gt; experience loss will result in a bigger percentage of the bar.  You are not<br/>\n&gt; really losing that much more experience numerically, but just graphically.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can test this yourself by measuring how long it takes to make up from a<br/>\n&gt; death in HL vs HL+1.  The time to regain the lost experience should be<br/>\n&gt; roughly equal, therefore the loss is roughly equal.  Your bar dropped more<br/>\n&gt; in HL+1, but you regain it faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wayne </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
