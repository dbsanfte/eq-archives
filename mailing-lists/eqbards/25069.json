I&#39;ve spent most of my<br/>\nhigher levels soloing or duoing, and this weekend, I ventured into Sebilis.<br/>\nWow, what an education.  When we had a chanter, life was all fun... he<br/>\nslowed, messed and hasted.  I really didnt have to do any work but when I<br/>\nwas the crowd control.. well, wow.. its really hard to mes things and then<br/>\nstill fight the target mob.  I started to get the hang of it though and<br/>\nfound outside views really help a lot.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy question is, what is up with the 53 mez and chanter mez?  I found out the<br/>\nhard way (i.e. group death spree) that they don&#39;t seem to stack!?!  But my<br/>\n53 mez seemed to overwrite the 59 chanter mez???!!! Whats up with that?  Am<br/>\nI wrong here?  What am I missing?<br/>\n <br/>\nTani, 53rd Bardette<br/>\nHalana, 60th Shammykins<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n <br/>\nP.S. Been a while, missed you all!
