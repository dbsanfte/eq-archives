You really get to see the world. Try traveling even more, its fun<br/>\nto see the reactions of players when you tell them in halas that you&#39;ve<br/>\ncome from kelethin, and even more when you tell the people in oggk or<br/>\ngrobb(well outta the guards&#39; views atleast) where you&#39;ve come from. The<br/>\nbards are supposed to travel, and IMO any class should see the world.<br/>\nYou might not level as fast, but saying that you&#39;ve visited every city<br/>\nby level 10 or so can turn quite a few heads. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Daniel P.

Sniderman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slide@...\">slide@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had JUST made level 8 - and at first was pretty annoyed at not having easy<br/>\n&gt; access to the song.  I found a high level bard to lead me to Kelethin and<br/>\n&gt; the bard&#39;s guild (he needed the 11th spell).  The trip was long and boring -<br/>\n&gt; but it gave me an opportunity to practice my lute playing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After getting the Bard&#39;s guild in Kelethin - confirmed I didn&#39;t have enough<br/>\n&gt; cash to buy it (which I expected) - so I figure what the hell - I&#39;ll try to<br/>\n&gt; meet some people and operate out of the area.  I had a great time - met new<br/>\n&gt; people, saw new sights, and killed new critters.  The Steamfont Mountains<br/>\n&gt; are particularly cool.  The windmills are particularly impressive (ooc -<br/>\n&gt; makes me want to go back and visit Holland again).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it wasn&#39;t for that - I&#39;d probably still be operating out of E Commons and<br/>\n&gt; N. Ro - and not &quot;see the world&quot;.   OOC - I think it&#39;s a smart design feature<br/>\n&gt; by the makers - as it forces you to play the bard - roaming the world,<br/>\n&gt; seeing the sights meeting new people...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The more I play this game - the more I like it - and the less I liked my UOL<br/>\n&gt; experience.  I like the social interaction of online - and I really NEVER<br/>\n&gt; met anyone in UOL - too worried about getting jumped and your stuff stolen.<br/>\n&gt; And (at least while I was online) the buddy list thingy never worked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A lot of people complain about the quirks of the Name filter - but I<br/>\n&gt; ultimately like it.  I got bit - It rejected &quot;Slide&quot; which I&#39;ve played on<br/>\n&gt; many an online (and solo) game - but big deal - in this land the spelling is<br/>\n&gt; different and hence &quot;Slyde&quot;.  I&#39;ll gladly give that up to never see<br/>\n&gt; &quot;k3W1d00dZ&quot;!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, April 25, 1999 8:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Songs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe that the bards in the back room of the guild hall sell a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; smattering of songs. I know that the 8th level song, Lament, is only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available in Kelethin as is 11 and 13 I think. A few higher level songs<br/>\n&gt; seem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available at all bard guilds but most of them will be hidden in other<br/>\n&gt; remote<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sure, tehre are some lists around on the internet listing the locations of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most of the songs but I think it is more fun to ask fellow bards in-game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where they might be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good Journey,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Heather [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathers24@...\">heathers24@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 7:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Songs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Heather &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathers24@...\">heathers24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I am new to this list and have read two digests so far.

I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leader<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; directly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8th level Bardess<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Show mom you love her.
