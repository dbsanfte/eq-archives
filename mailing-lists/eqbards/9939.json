What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am <br/>\n&gt; wearing the shin<br/>\n&gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I <br/>\n&gt; have never seen<br/>\n&gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be <br/>\n&gt; a rose tinged<br/>\n&gt; silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly <br/>\n&gt; get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>\n&gt; examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The <br/>\n&gt; wood elf females<br/>\n&gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged. <br/>\n&gt;  Is this the<br/>\n&gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose <br/>\n&gt; color is normal<br/>\n&gt; then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
