I also figured<br/>\nthat since we get Dodge (even though it&#39;s capped ridiculously low), this<br/>\nmight prove of some interest to the bardic community.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It seems one guildbro of mine (lvl 35 ranger named Fandrall) decided to<br/>\ntest out the effectiveness of Agility vs. AC.  He and another guildbro (also<br/>\nlvl 35 ranger named Mezzevil)  found a nice quiet spot and began the<br/>\ntesting.  Mezz (the test subject/sucker... heh!) wore his best AC outfit<br/>\nwith no Agi buff items (AC about 697 and Agi about 110), and let Fandrall<br/>\nsmack him around a good bit.  Next test, Mezz stripped down to his BVD&#39;s,<br/>\nand again, Fandrall smacked him around (AC was 480, Agi 110).  The third<br/>\ntest had Mezz wear his best Agi buff items with as little AC impact as<br/>\npossible (AC was 515, Agi 166... 56 point Agi increase).  Fourth test was to<br/>\nkeep all Agi items on, and put the rest of his AC items back on (AC 671, Agi<br/>\n166).  A fifth test was done with same items as test #4, but attacker hit<br/>\nfrom behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results?  A quote from Fandrall&#39;s post:<br/>\n&quot;1) Armor class STRONGLY impacts how much damage is done on a given HIT, but<br/>\nhas nothing to do with whether a hit occurs or not. This is true with both<br/>\nhigh or low agility (high and low being defined as 110 and 166 for this<br/>\ntest). Agil was held constant while AC was allowed to change dramatically,<br/>\nif you compare values between tests 1-2 and 3-4.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Agility did not significantly increase the percentage of times that dodge<br/>\nor parry occurred. There was an increase, but it was within the limits of<br/>\nwhat could have occurred based on randomness (limited sample). I could get a<br/>\ndefinitive answer if I swung at him 50 thousand times, but I tested his<br/>\npatience as it is ;p (btw I am also a level 35 ranger, but that is mere<br/>\ncoincidence.... I maintained constant stats for all trials so I could have<br/>\nbeen any mob, but identical for all trials).<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Agility also did NOT significantly affect the number of times I missed<br/>\nhim. Again, there was a slight difference, but not statistically<br/>\nsignificant. I was disappointed at this result..... seeing how much time and<br/>\nmoney I&#39;d spent acquiring agility items that sacrificed some AC. It&#39;s<br/>\npossible from others who have spoken that my agil difference in the test<br/>\nwasn&#39;t large enough, or didn&#39;t cross enough &quot;boundaries&quot;, if such things<br/>\nexist. (shrugs)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Of the four trials, the lowest damage per SWING ratio was in trial #1,<br/>\nmax AC, low agil. Even case #4, with just SLIGHTLY less AC, and 56 more<br/>\nagility, had higher ratio of damage per swing (5.3 to 5.0). This takes into<br/>\naccount misses, so it&#39;s the best measure of &quot;how much damage am I taking&quot;,<br/>\nregardless of whether it&#39;s a few big ones or many smaller ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) The fifth trial showed that getting hit in the back isn&#39;t any more<br/>\ndamaging than getting hit in the front, from a damage-distribution sense.<br/>\nHOWEVER, I found out that you cannot dodge or parry any blow that comes from<br/>\nbehind you. The miss rate was pretty consistent with trial 4. So you do get<br/>\nhit with more damage when attacked from behind, but only because you can&#39;t<br/>\nparry or dodge. (Since Riposte only happens at 35, it&#39;s a non factor in this<br/>\ntest.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be (as I pointed out in a bump to John&#39;s post on the EQ boards)<br/>\nthat some of the states are broken?  This would certainly explain why the<br/>\nfolks at Verant are extremely hesitant to talk about them.  (and don&#39;t start<br/>\ntalking that &quot;black helicopter&quot; crap either ya bunch of reprobates ;pppp ).<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing his Short Sword of Morin (6/22) and Dragoon Dagger (6/23... in<br/>\noff-hand) with Piercing skill at 176 and 1H Slash at 177, Fandrall&#39;s Dirk<br/>\nhit for an average of 2 POINTS lower than the sword even though they have<br/>\nthe same damage rating.  Could it be that Piercing weapons do less damage<br/>\nthan Slashing ones?<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting...<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
