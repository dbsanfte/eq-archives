Her Fear is hard to resist and he slow takes out any melee <br/>\npower that isn&#39;t perma-feared.  It&#39;s been said that melee&#39;s HAVE to <br/>\nbe 58+ to even stand a chance of resisting anything, so LEVEL matters <br/>\nmuch more than resists.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a pre-Velious Dragon, so remember she&#39;s only got 32k hps.  Her <br/>\nCH will heal up to 10k.  She&#39;s also an ICE Dragon, who is very <br/>\nsusceptible to FIRE.  Wizards, Mages, Druids, even Rangers have fire <br/>\nbased spells.  Gather up as many of those classes as you can, lower <br/>\nher FIRE resists a bit for good measure and blow the *&#@ out of <br/>\nher.  My plan called for ~20 Wizards, Mages and Druids and she would <br/>\nbe dead in less than 10 seconds from the first synchronized blast.  <br/>\nTo do her in this way, you don&#39;t even need much tank support... just <br/>\none 60 Warrior (with some healing support), really, to hold her <br/>\nattention so she doesn&#39;t claw apart your nukers while they get into <br/>\nposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nRetired on Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
