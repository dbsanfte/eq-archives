People who do this impact _everyone_.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s why... I am a bard, I have to work hard for the exp<br/>\nI get.  I can barely solo greens anymore, forget about tactics<br/>\nlike fear/chain and charm, they will only get you killed.  You<br/>\nare playing the wrong class if you want to solo.  75% of your <br/>\nsongs have the effect &quot;PARTY&quot; in them, learn to use them.  You <br/>\nwill never be a soloer, our songs are not geared for that line<br/>\nof work.  Instead, you have to group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow grouping is great if you have time, stable group, etc.<br/>\nOtherwise, you hover and do odd tasks and maybe a few quests,<br/>\nuntil you can find a decent group.  While these druids are out<br/>\nin full force, powerleveling past you.  So where do you come in?<br/>\nHow does this affect you?<br/>\n<br/>\nTry going to earn your first pair of rubi legs.   Try to go<br/>\nacquire a bloodclaw.   Try to get your favorite item.  You can&#39;t.<br/>\nBecause these powerleveling jokers have long surpassed you and<br/>\nare now camping the goodies, that you should be after.  Kiters<br/>\ncan outlevel us, and thus pickup the goodies before we can work<br/>\nour way there.  This is the imbalance.  I&#39;ve watched druids get<br/>\ntwo plus levels per day, kiting.  Now instead of a handful of<br/>\nlevel 35 people, the whole server is flooded with level 35 druids,<br/>\nnecros, shamans... anyone who employes the risk-free kiting tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about risk.  Our fear/chain is not reliable enough to <br/>\nuse to make tons of exp.  One resist could mean certain death.<br/>\nIf the druid runs out of mana, hell, the thing is snared, you can<br/>\noutrun it no problem.  Snare is that reliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheesy or not, druids are beginning to populate more and more<br/>\nof the servers, because they are extremely easy to level with<br/>\nvery little risk.  Thus increasing the traffic in areas where<br/>\nother players who worked very long and hard to get where they<br/>\nare at are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am _not_ for eliminating kiting...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they want to fix druid kiting and make it more like bard<br/>\nreverse kiting (ie risky), they need only make snare less<br/>\nreliable (random shorter durations).  That evens the playing<br/>\nfields, introduces more risk, and everyone is happy, including<br/>\nme the non-soloable, hard-working bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 35th hell.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
