Our Melee &quot;Skills&quot; have never been<br/>\nmuch better than pure casters.  And there were always some freakin brutal<br/>\nweapons available to casters that were 2h blunt (Gatorsmash maul comes to<br/>\nmind for shaman).  The weapon field was a TAD skewed in our favor but the<br/>\nbottom line was that our melee ability isn&#39;t much better than that of a<br/>\ncleric, shaman or druid.  All four of them get 4 offense/defense points per<br/>\nlevel (to our 5) have only slightly lower dodge caps (75 or 80) and can wear<br/>\nequivalent armor (Cleric armor is actully just as good, if not better).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, sure we were &quot;Better&quot; at melee.  But we were FAR from &quot;Good&quot; at melee.<br/>\nWe have always been a VERY poor substitute for any of the &quot;melee&quot; classes in<br/>\nthe game.  Early in final, as Kit has said, a lot of bards who hadn&#39;t been<br/>\nbeyond level 20 yet were adamant that bards were only slightly worse at<br/>\nmelee than other hybrids.  Which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are the &quot;Caster&quot; hybrid.  The others are &quot;Melee&quot; hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywayz, Kit is right.  A lot more bards understand themselves better these<br/>\ndays ;)  It&#39;s actually nice to think back to some of the rather humorous<br/>\nassumptions that newbie bards used to start with ;)  Now days most newbie<br/>\nbards (the good ones anyway) get educated by the best (those on this list)<br/>\nearly on and learn how to be very effective bards indeed.  I would say that<br/>\noverall the quality of bards has improved because of the bards on this list<br/>\nand, to a slightly lesser extent, the bards on the Concert Hall.  Rokken&#39;s<br/>\nsite, Caster&#39;s Realm and Concert Hall have all become excellent resources<br/>\nfor bards.  When I started barding we didn&#39;t have anything but word of mouth<br/>\n(usually in the chat area when servers were down).<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nLevelling since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our melee skills pre kunark were much better than druids or shamen based<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our selection of weapons. post kunark, with the discovery of some brutal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>2h<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; blunt items, the scales are more balanced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
