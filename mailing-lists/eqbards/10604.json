I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I&#39;m some power-leveling freakazoid.  That&#39;s the <br/>\namount of exp that I feel GOOD about on those occasions when I&#39;m camping something <br/>\nfor just that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit that I have a goal of at least one level per weekend, but playing ALL <br/>\nweekend, as I do, that usually breaks down as:  15 hours to level, 10-15 hours to <br/>\nmess around, 10 hours to solo one of my secondary characters (I get exhausted much <br/>\nfaster playing in groups).<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to my friends, I&#39;m a snail.  I&#39;m now frequently grouping with the <br/>\nsecondary characters of my early-days party members.  One guy, with only one <br/>\ncomputer in his house, has a level 50 warrior and a level 27 Enchantress, and his <br/>\nWIFE has a level 34 Cleric!  And they work full time!<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\nBisibiku, enchantress 11, Innoruuk<br/>\nAangie, warrior 11, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Grief - I&#39;m happy with that over a couple weeks time - and that&#39;s being on<br/>\n&gt; a LOT too. Just not that concerned about leveling - got other things to do,<br/>\n&gt; people to see, songs to sing, drinks to down - when it happens, it happens.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I consider it good when I can net a bubble in 3-4 hours, so perhaps I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;demanding as you!  ;)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
