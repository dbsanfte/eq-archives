But the strangest thing is that<br/>\nthey<br/>\ndon&#39;t immediately kill me, and only particular guards are aggressive to me<br/>\n(like<br/>\none guard with ONE name, maybe two).  I was standing around for awhile, and<br/>\nI<br/>\nthink perhaps whatever I had attacked might have been drawn to guards and<br/>\ndone<br/>\nits little area effect damage thing, though it was off at the time.  But<br/>\nwhat<br/>\npuzzles me is the fact that I will return to guard area, after no combat and<br/>\nhealing up for up to 5 mins, and a guard will come and lop my head off for<br/>\nno<br/>\nparticular reason.  I am definitely reporting it as a bug, the same thing<br/>\nhappened to my monk when he attacked an orc near guards.

How much does a diety effect your actual<br/>\n&gt; abilities<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and inter-race relations?
