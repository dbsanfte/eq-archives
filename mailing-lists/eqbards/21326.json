Normally, on the weekend, I&#39;d rather play<br/>\nEQ than read about it. ;)  But today, I had to do something. I&#39;ve just made<br/>\na post to our Bard Thread on the Everquest message boards. We&#39;re up to nine<br/>\npages of mostly well written posts.  And still Verant doesn&#39;t understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I love playing my bard. And I hate to see all the effort that has been<br/>\nput into this class by skilled and intelligent people like Kaeria, Rokenn,<br/>\nTalies, Shada, and many other less accomplished but equally experienced<br/>\npeople go to waste.  I have 7 other characters that I can play but my<br/>\nfavorite character of all is my weak, underappreciated, struggling bard that<br/>\ncan occasionally tip the scales in the favor of life rather than death for<br/>\nmy groups. I want all the problems that have been created by Verant to be<br/>\nfixed.  I want someone working at Verant to understand the core ability of<br/>\nour class - our songs - the way so many players do. And I don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nmake that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n    If anyone on this list has any ideas how we can get Verant to<br/>\nacknowledge and address the problems with our great class, *please* tell me<br/>\nwhat I can do and how I can help. The only avenue available seems to me to<br/>\nbe the message boards.  Please post something. Even if it has been repeated<br/>\nagain (and again and again) in many different ways by many different people,<br/>\nmaybe someone&#39;s wording or turn of phrase will make the difference and turn<br/>\non a lightbulb in someone&#39;s head at Verant and they will look again.<br/>\nProbably not. But please post anyway. I don&#39;t want to see my role models of<br/>\nbardhood disappear. Maybe it&#39;s time for the bards to start making some noise<br/>\nrather than continuing to die quietly...?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time, dedication, advice and support.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nAanluil Lumiaria<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Please, if you reply to this message to eqbards, cut out any<br/>\nunnecessary stuff in your reply so our friends on the list don&#39;t have to<br/>\nread this very lengthy post again and again and again. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nP. P.S. Here is my post from the message boards.  Please post what you<br/>\nthink, write about the stuff I have forgotten and add your voice to the<br/>\nboards:<br/>\n<br/>\n----------message board post follows----------<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night at peak time on the Erollisi Marr server there were over 1800<br/>\npeople online and a &#39;/who all bard 30 60&#39; came up with 16 bards who weren&#39;t<br/>\n/anon.  Is there a problem with the bard class? No. Well, not really. Well,<br/>\nactually there are many little problems with the bard class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why are so many players upset and quitting their bards over such<br/>\nseemingly minor problems? After all, every class has some problems with<br/>\nit... and it&#39;s necessary for classes to be different to promote class<br/>\ninterdependence. This must be yet another typical class envy post, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nW R O N G !<br/>\n<br/>\nI started my bard one month after Erollisi Marr was created. In the past<br/>\nyear, I&#39;ve seen *so many* little problems with our songs.  And, like many<br/>\nfine players I&#39;ve met, I tolerate them.  I work around them.  I laugh<br/>\nruefully and shrug that something so obviously broken yet so simple to fix<br/>\nwasn&#39;t tested, or was somehow overlooked and I keep playing. I love my bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has never been an easy class to play.  You don&#39;t have power like a<br/>\nwizard. Or soloability like a druid or necro.  You don&#39;t have heals like a<br/>\ncleric and can&#39;t tank like a warrior, paladin, shadowknight or ranger. I&#39;ve<br/>\nplayed all those classes. I know. Yet still I love my bard, despite all it&#39;s<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bard, you get nerfed with the hybrids, your songs get broken when<br/>\ncaster songs get adjusted, your melee capability is FAR behind any other<br/>\nhybrid&#39;s ability and unlike other hybrids, you don&#39;t get a full set of<br/>\nspells. Instead, you get one *song* per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs are NOT spells. They can&#39;t be cast then forgotten. Beneficial songs<br/>\nonly affect group members. Direct damage songs are much weaker than even a<br/>\nwarrior&#39;s BASH skill. Area effect spells get you killed because your tanking<br/>\nability is nearly as weak as a caster. In fact, my druid can tank better.<br/>\nEverything about the class is weak to begin with. Yet I love my bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy play such an obviously weak class? What do bard&#39;s *have* then, if we<br/>\ndon&#39;t get anything to compensate for the hybrid XP penalties, the weak<br/>\ndefensive ability, weak melee ability and limited spell selection? etc. We<br/>\nhave our songs. The benefit and bane of our existence. Our songs, the core<br/>\nraison d&#39;etre of a bard, is why so many bards are quitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany great players of bards have put a lot of effort into exploring,<br/>\nunderstanding and testing our songs and they have generously shared their<br/>\nknowledge and experience; what type of instrument each song can use, which<br/>\nsongs require an instrument, which songs stack with which other songs, which<br/>\nsongs overwrite other classes&#39; spells. The main focus of being a bard, is to<br/>\nuse your songs to enhance a group. It&#39;s vital to know how your songs can<br/>\ncombine, affect, and enhance other classes. Therein lies the reason *so<br/>\nmany* bards (and other skilled players who really understand a bard&#39;s role)<br/>\nare upset. Verant shows a complete lack of *understanding* about the bard<br/>\nclass that they miraculously created.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis latest debacle with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby is an issue that has been<br/>\nongoing for *nearly a year* and during that time, more and more problems<br/>\nwith the class have been inadvertently introduced by patches to other class<br/>\ncapabilities. These problems *added* to the existing problems with the class<br/>\nwhich remained unaddressed. And each time a new inadvertent problem occurs<br/>\nbecause of a patch, many fine bards have put their heads together and tested<br/>\nthe songs thoroughly and discovered the problem and have even hazarded<br/>\nguesses about the code causing the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time a new problem is introduced and old problems remain unadressed,<br/>\nFACTS about the way the songs work have been presented politely, clearly and<br/>\nprecisely to Verant so that they can fix the problems they keep creating.<br/>\nAnd every time, Verant *ignores* the hard work and dedication bards have put<br/>\nin trying to keep this class working properly throughout the changes that<br/>\ninevitably break things in subtle and complex ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, after many polite reminders, they quickly &#39;test&#39; the songs using<br/>\nmodified eqclient programs that DONT SHOW WHAT THE PLAYERS SEE (eg secondary<br/>\nresist messages), they &#39;test&#39; certain functions of a song and not the other<br/>\nfunctions of the very same song (eg see invis), they &#39;test&#39; the changes in<br/>\nconditions under which the problem doesn&#39;t occur (eg lullaby by level 15<br/>\nbard vs level 15), and then they CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE TESTED IT and that the<br/>\nsong is &#39;working as intended&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll these problems are ON TOP of the myriad of little problems with the<br/>\nclass that bards have been patiently waiting to see fixed; missing songs<br/>\n(the CORE of the class remains incomplete), the bard drum animation, BUGS<br/>\n(such as the song that causes a dark elf to lose his natural infravision),<br/>\nand other such problems that have existed SINCE THE GAME STARTED and have<br/>\nyet to be repaired, addressed, or even acknowledged.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sad that so many wonderful, intelligent, thorough, polite and<br/>\ndedicated players have been treated so poorly. I understand why so many<br/>\npeople have quit playing the bards they love and why some people feel that<br/>\nit has gone too far and they must quit this great game. And like most bards,<br/>\nI secretly keep hoping that someday, maybe someone at Verant with a little<br/>\nbit of patience and intelligence will pay attention to the many posts we&#39;ve<br/>\nmade. That someone at Verant will *read* and try to *understand* what has<br/>\nbeen written by bards rather than glancing briefly at a post and thinking<br/>\nthey understand what was written then proving by their responses that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nParadoxically, bard players have never been a vocal group of people. We<br/>\ngenerally play bards because we believe in the rightness of dialog and<br/>\ncommunication rather than making the bigest bang, the loudest squeak, the<br/>\ngreatest noise. If anyone at Verant reads this post, REALLY reads this post,<br/>\nI hope they stop and think and try to understand what has been written by so<br/>\nmany good people before me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
