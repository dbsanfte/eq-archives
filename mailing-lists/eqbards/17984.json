Also Innoruk was killed Friday and Monday night.  <br/>\nThey can be killed.  All i did was to keep the party resistances buffed for <br/>\nboth mobs, and we (about 36-50 depending on night) won the fights with few <br/>\ndeaths.  Not sure if anyone has said it yet, but the Evensong mace appears <br/>\nto be the common drop, so keep up that 1hb skill! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewdeur Fflamson, lvl 49, Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Btw, I would love to know when (and if) anyone takes out Maestro after<br/>\n&gt;the mid-week patch last week, and how it was done.  The uber-players in<br/>\n&gt;my guild are of the opinion that he&#39;s been bumped to L63.  Their<br/>\n&gt;consensus is that Cazic Thule is a pansy compared to the new improved<br/>\n&gt;Maestro.  I&#39;m sure this opinion has nothing to do with the fact that he<br/>\n&gt;smoked us twice.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk, born cynic<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
