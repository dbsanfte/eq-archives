A<br/>\n&gt; paladin, rogue, and I did pretty well in Cazic like this,<br/>\n&gt; picking off one or two (sometimes three) of the lesser mobs.  <br/>\n&gt; I had my songs that could taunt, the rogue had backstab, and<br/>\n&gt; the paladin was doing some nice damage with his SBH and double<br/>\n&gt; attack.  We certainly had to stay more alert during combat,<br/>\n&gt; monitoring each others&#39; health and backing out or taunting as<br/>\n&gt; needed, but were able to do pretty well there (didn&#39;t die, got<br/>\n&gt; lots of loot and experience).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having a healer basically lets you be a little more sloppy<br/>\n&gt; with distributing damage, and take a little (or a lot) more<br/>\n&gt; risk in wandering away from the zone or fighting things you<br/>\n&gt; might not be able to beat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
