For example, we need lambent stones for each of<br/>\nthe armor pieces.  Will other classes also need lambent stones for their<br/>\narmor quests or are the components they need completely different than ours?<br/>\nThe same question applies to the special loot items we need.  I hope that<br/>\neach class has their own unique components required for their quest.  You<br/>\nwould assume that if lambent armor is bard only then only bards have a need<br/>\nfor lambent stones.  However, everyone knows that you can&#39;t assume anything<br/>\nwhen it comes to EQ.  Can anyone provide confirmation on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
