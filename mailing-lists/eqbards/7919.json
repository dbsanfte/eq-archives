Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>\nas a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>\nbut there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>\nof them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>\ntrue gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>\ngiving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>\ninto the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>\nreal joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>\nenchancement.
