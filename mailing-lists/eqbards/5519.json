I usually want to help whenever I<br/>\ncan and admit I have even foolishly helped someone get their corpse from the<br/>\nheart of the Ogre Camp.  I didn&#39;t die, but I probably should have.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\nmany people were amazed who saw this lone bard racing across W Karana with 8<br/>\nor so ogres in tow.  I let them take a rest stop at guard tower number two<br/>\nwhile I raced on to the zone.  I imagine they made short work of the poor<br/>\nguards there, but hey that&#39;s why they get hazard pay!  Hopefully they paused<br/>\nat tower one or their way as well, &#39;cause after I zoned back in from Q Hills<br/>\nthe remains of their angry band were meandering back towards the camp.  Its<br/>\namazing how easy it is to loot a body in the middle of a now empty ogre<br/>\ncamp, no one goes near the place to bother you!<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 1:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Corpse Recoveries<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How would others have handled this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly as you did. There&#39;s no bank there to store<br/>\nyour items in. There&#39;s absolutely NO reason for you<br/>\nto have put yourself in jeopardy like that. If it<br/>\nwas a friend, I would have gone to Qeynos, banked my<br/>\nstuff and came back - but for someone you just know<br/>\nby seeing occasionally, and you were getting ready<br/>\nto log out? &quot;Best wishes..&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo corpses are worse than one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do others have experiences where players feel<br/>\n&gt; like just because we can located we&#39;re somehow<br/>\n&gt; *obligated* to do so regardless of the<br/>\n&gt; circumstances or dangers?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask someone to<br/>\nhelp me retrieve my corpse in a horribly dangerous<br/>\nsituation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>\nI asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>\nthem what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>\neven answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>\nthey backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>\nthere. I thanked him and let him go. No use making <br/>\nhim die too.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\nJoin our community member news update at <br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
