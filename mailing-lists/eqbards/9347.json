I really have to force myself to scan my<br/>\nhealth bar. in fact, I scan my healer&#39;s health bar more than my own.  the<br/>\nteam needs to keep him alive and he will keep us alive.  this makes a huge<br/>\ndifference in how effectively you can do your job - whether its crowd<br/>\ncontrol, tankage, or mana song.<br/>\n<br/>\nkeep tryin and try to get a group going that plays on a regular basis and is<br/>\nwell balanced group of classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tOperaman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, October 28, 1999 3:48 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Newbie questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Operaman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby)<br/>\nwith pickup groups<br/>\n\t\tat my level (16-19).
