We<br/>\ncaused probably one of the biggest trains in the history of<br/>\nMistmoore.  From what I could tell, the music room, negotiator<br/>\nroom, piano/window room (and stuff outside), and all the mobs<br/>\nin the little nooks and crannies in between came pouring out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plateu in front of the castle is easy to break (go in<br/>\ninvis to the far side, drop invis, and lull everything you<br/>\nsee, then pull).  The mobs just inside the gate (there are 2-4<br/>\nof them) are easy as well, as are the two gargoyles in the<br/>\ngrand hall/lobby.  You got this far:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; group.  I have been in a group once that actually<br/>\n&gt; managed to fight their way into the lobby (with<br/>\n&gt; the stairs going to second floor, etc.) but then<br/>\n&gt; we couldn&#39;t figure out how to reasonably go much<br/>\n&gt; further due to large clusters of mobs at such odd<br/>\n&gt; angles that lament wasn&#39;t really doable, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Plus the fact that everyone was scared out of<br/>\n&gt; their minds because of the stories of bad pathing,<br/>\n&gt; trains, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.  Be glad you didn&#39;t try it.  I got to this point, tried<br/>\nto come up with a way to lament the mobs but couldn&#39;t.  So I<br/>\nhad a ranger try casting harmony.  That&#39;s when we started that<br/>\ntrain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem isn&#39;t that lament or harmony don&#39;t work - they<br/>\ndo.  The problem is that the pathing is so screwed up that the<br/>\nmobs take circuitous routes.  You pull the mob in front of the<br/>\nmusic room, and instead of following you, it will circle<br/>\naround the entire music room, out the back door, through the<br/>\nnegotiator room, then through the lobby, incidently pulling<br/>\neverything it meets along the way.  There *might* be a way to<br/>\npull it semi-safely (I suspect you can pull the negotiator<br/>\nroom by itself), but I&#39;m not going to risk getting other<br/>\ninnocents killed in trains figuring out how.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several ways to safely get to the music room.  By<br/>\nfar the easiest is to have a high level person pull.  We had a<br/>\nL48 person do it, but I hear a L47 can do it as well.  Most of<br/>\nthe stuff won&#39;t aggro on a person this high, so he can pull,<br/>\nthe mob can go through its convoluted pathing, and it won&#39;t<br/>\ntrigger any extras.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have a high level person, someone in wolf form<br/>\nwho hasn&#39;t played much in Mistmoore can pull just a few at a<br/>\ntime (I think agro radius is linked to faction).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have any of these, you have two options I know<br/>\nof.  First is to invis your party and go back into the<br/>\nkitchen.  Kill the three mobs there, clear the hallway, then<br/>\nthe maid and bulter rooms.  Then comes the hard part - using<br/>\ninvis to move around, lull the gargoyles in front of the<br/>\nnegotiator room.  Once they&#39;re lulled, you can position<br/>\nyourself to lull stuff inside the negotiator room (the agro<br/>\nradius extends beyond the door so don&#39;t get too close).  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll get 1-3 mobs at a time.  If you&#39;re not so<br/>\nlucky, you&#39;ll get the entire negotiator room, the three mobs<br/>\nin the alcove beyond it, and a couple gargs (which is the<br/>\nmonster pull I described in my other post).  Once the<br/>\nnegotiator room is clear, you can start to crack the music<br/>\nroom.  I haven&#39;t gotten this far, so I can&#39;t help you beyond<br/>\nthis point.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other option is go in the back way, through the jail.  <br/>\nClear up to just before the pool room.  If Xicotl is not up,<br/>\nyou can clear the pool room, then pull the room down the<br/>\nstairs.  If Xicotl is up, you&#39;re probably best off invising<br/>\neveryone and just going down the stairs to the next room and<br/>\nclearing there.  After that is the piano room - make sure you<br/>\nfight away from the windows or you&#39;ll pull the entire outside<br/>\nas well.  Clear the outside if you want to be safe.  Then the<br/>\nalcove just before the music room.  After this I&#39;m not sure,<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve seen other groups pull the music room from here so it<br/>\nmust be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a theory on another way to pull.  I was invis and had<br/>\nSoW on, and started what should&#39;ve been a train.  All I got<br/>\nwas three mobs.  I think what happened is that after I<br/>\ntriggered the first mob and it started its screwed up pathing,<br/>\nmy invis kicked in making me indifferent to everything else.  <br/>\nSo the castle didn&#39;t get aggroed when the three mobs passed by<br/>\nthem (kinda like how green mobs won&#39;t trigger if you let a<br/>\nrunner get away).  I haven&#39;t really tested if this is what is<br/>\nreally happening, so use it at your own risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this becomes much easier of course if another group has<br/>\npartially cleared the inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have it, pretty much all I&#39;ve learned about<br/>\nthe castle in Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
