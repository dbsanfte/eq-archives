Everything below is<br/>\nfrom memory so if someone else remembers the post correct me if I left<br/>\nsomething out or misstated the original posters comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster had a theory about the effect of equipping a lute while<br/>\nsinging lullaby.  Like other bards have commented, the poster had noticed<br/>\nthat mobs were still attacking him even though they did not resist the<br/>\nlullaby and should have been sleeping.  In one combat he decided not to<br/>\nequip the lute and instead just sang the lullaby.  He noticed that the mobs<br/>\nstopped attacking him while they were asleep.  The song appeared to work<br/>\nlike it was supposed to.  The poster then stated a theory that perhaps<br/>\nlullaby has two effects that mobs have a chance to resist, similar to DDD.<br/>\nWith DDD, you get the area of effect DOT plus the lowering of the mobs AC<br/>\neffect. If the mobs fails one resist but makes the other then the song gets<br/>\nfully resisted.  The posters theory was that lullaby had two effects and in<br/>\norder to get both of them to work you have to equip the lute.  Singing the<br/>\nsong only has one effect of putting the mob to sleep.  Mobs only get one<br/>\nresist check.  Singing the song while equipping a lute puts them to sleep<br/>\nplus nixes the hate list.  Mob gets two resist checks.  If the mob makes one<br/>\nthe song doesn&#39;t effect him.  In this case there is a bug that still gives<br/>\nyou the &quot;head nods&quot; message when you should get a resist message.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t had the chance to test this for myself so I thought I would throw it<br/>\nout and see what everyone else thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
