I<br/>\n&gt;can verify this because on my second trip I saw the rock that I had swam to<br/>\n&gt;just before the boat zoned.  Now that I am in the water, I have two choices.<br/>\n&gt;How would you &quot;Roleplay&quot; this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can try to swim to Butcherblock or swim all the way back across the Ocean<br/>\n&gt;of Tears to the dock to catch the next boat.   I realize that Butcherblock<br/>\n&gt;is much closer.  So I use my Sense Heading and examine the sun/moon to<br/>\n&gt;figure out which is East.  Then I head in the opposite direction (because<br/>\n&gt;the zone was put in backwards).  Soon I realize that I am not making any<br/>\n&gt;progress.  There is some invisible shield blocking my progress.  The boat<br/>\n&gt;passes through this shield with no problems.  Well, I&#39;ll swim back to<br/>\n&gt;Freeport.  After a long swim I find the same shield is blocking Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;OK, so I&#39;ll hail the boat as it comes by and the boat will stop and rescue<br/>\n&gt;me.  Here it comes.  Everyone on the boat sees me and is yelling.  But the<br/>\n&gt;boat doesn&#39;t stop.  No one bothers to throw a rope down to me.  It just<br/>\n&gt;leaves me in the ocean.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You might think that was roleplaying, but I don&#39;t.  Even if I accepted your<br/>\n&gt;mythical wave that &quot;knocked&quot; me off the boat, I still can&#39;t do any of the<br/>\n&gt;other things that I would want to do that would extract myself from this<br/>\n&gt;situation.  I consider the game&#39;s roleplaying options &quot;broken&quot; at this point<br/>\n&gt;so I see no problem with using /loc in this situation, even for the die-hard<br/>\n&gt;roleplayers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I actually /petitioned a GM and got moved to the island with the dock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Boat Problems<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In my mind I can justify gadgetry that is intended as part of the game or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is separate from the game but can in a reasonable way be considered part of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the game, such as this mailing list or externally obtained maps.  Mailing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;lists and maps are straightforward ways for people to exchange information<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;My problem is using programming internals to further my ability to beat the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;computer program.  That&#39;s not the game I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;disassembling code to decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>\n&gt;&gt;programs of my own, or getting playing hints by printing out all the text<br/>\n&gt;&gt;messages from the software.  That&#39;s playing the computer system, not the<br/>\n&gt;game.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;/loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a game world feature.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This is an old, familiar argument.  I&#39;ve had it before about exploiting<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rule glitches in live roleplaying games.  Some people do because they get<br/>\n&gt;&gt;more power.  Others won&#39;t because they want to play the fantasy game, not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the external rules.  I&#39;m of the latter group and as a game rules designer<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tried to eliminate the abilities of the former.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Bob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt;Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
