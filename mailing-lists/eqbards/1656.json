So, you are going to be number one on their hit list.  Also,<br/>\nyour hp is lower than the tanks.  So a given amount of damage to you will be<br/>\na higher percentage of your total hp than the same amount applied to a tank.<br/>\nAll of the mobs will want to hit you and maybe the one other party member<br/>\nwho is hitting them.  So, the tanks will be fighting one mob while you will<br/>\nbe fighting all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet some things (rings, etc.) to add dex so that you can dodge more hits.<br/>\nTry to get your party to attack fewer mobs at one time - I know sometimes<br/>\nthey all get pulled in - but sometimes a cleric can lull a few while you<br/>\npull the other one or two away.  The party can gang the one or two then come<br/>\nback for the lulled ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you guys all attacking the same mob and ganging the toughest one first?<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to get party members to follow even simple tactics but learning to<br/>\nuse the assist command will really help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tReece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, June 08, 1999 8:15 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\tEQBards<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Utility of Lullaby and<br/>\nInvisibility songs<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;m only 14th level and with deadlines for my graduate<br/>\nthesis quickly<br/>\n\t\tapproaching, it may be a long time before I get the chance<br/>\nto discover the<br/>\n\t\tanswer to these questions for myself so I&#39;m gonna go ahead<br/>\nand ask them now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tEveryone knows the bard is #1 on the hit list for enemy<br/>\ncreatures.  In my<br/>\n\t\tmost recent skirmishes with the Dervish Cutthroats, I<br/>\ncontinually found<br/>\n\t\tmyself taking the brunt of the damage even though there were<br/>\ntanks in the<br/>\n\t\tgroup.  Even when I tried to back up and quit attacking due<br/>\nto low health<br/>\n\t\tthe cutthroats continued to attack me even though I was<br/>\ndoing no damage to<br/>\n\t\tthem.  The end result is that I ended up dying a couple of<br/>\ntimes when other<br/>\n\t\tmembers of my group ended up taking either zero or little<br/>\ndamage in the<br/>\n\t\tfight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI am hoping that when I gain the ability to sing the Lullaby<br/>\nand<br/>\n\t\tInvisibility song my survivability rate will vastly improve.<br/>\nHere is how I<br/>\n\t\tassume they work so would like confirmation if my<br/>\nassumptions are correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFor the Lullaby, if I am getting attacked by more than one<br/>\ncreature, I<br/>\n\t\tassume that I will be able to sing the Lullaby while in<br/>\ncombat, put them to<br/>\n\t\tsleep, and then either attack them one at a time or gain<br/>\nenough time so I<br/>\n\t\tcan safely run away (I know this is cowardly but hey in the<br/>\nend you got to<br/>\n\t\tlook out for your own well-being:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFor the Invisibility song, I assume that if I turn off the<br/>\nAutoAttack, start<br/>\n\t\tsinging the song, then I and the rest of the party will<br/>\nbecome invisible.<br/>\n\t\tParty members who continue to attack the creatures will<br/>\nbecome visible upon<br/>\n\t\ttheir next attack.  If I continue to sing the song and never<br/>\nattack again, I<br/>\n\t\tassume that I will be safe for the duration of the combat.<br/>\nThis all assumes<br/>\n\t\tthat the creatures I am fighting can&#39;t detect invisibility.<br/>\nAlso, if I am<br/>\n\t\tsinging the Invisibility song and not attacking the<br/>\ncreatures, and then<br/>\n\t\tstart twisting a song that benefits the party like Hymn or<br/>\nAnthem, will I<br/>\n\t\tstay invisible.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks <br/>\n\t\tGaltin<br/>\n\t\tE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tGot an opinion?<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tMake it count!
