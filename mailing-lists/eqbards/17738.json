(Didn&#39;t at least one of say you like being presented<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with challenges that cause you to find new ways of playing a character?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In truth, if the mage were level 11 I&#39;d still place bets against you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry.  They&#39;ve got some pretty good pets.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t have many tools at level 11.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s an anything-goes fight (which I&#39;d assume it is if a<br/>\n&gt; level 15 is fighting a level 11), I would kick in Accel, wait<br/>\n&gt; for him to order his pet to attack me, then quickly drag the<br/>\n&gt; pet out of command range and through a bunch of hostile mobs<br/>\n&gt; (arc your path so you don&#39;t go through the mobs but the pet<br/>\n&gt; does).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t want to be quite so dirty, I&#39;d drag the pet away,<br/>\n&gt; run back and attack the mage, drag the pet away again when it<br/>\n&gt; returns, repeat.  You can use Warsong and melee to hope to<br/>\n&gt; interrupt his casting, or Accel to try to get out of range<br/>\n&gt; before his spell fires (note that neither consumes mana, so<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d be relying on fizzles to deplete his mana).  And if the<br/>\n&gt; pet roots you...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The key I think is that you can stay out of attack range and<br/>\n&gt; heal indefinitely, while he cannot (gotta run out of bandages<br/>\n&gt; some time).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
