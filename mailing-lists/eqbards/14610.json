Roamers do not drop equipment<br/>\n  anymore (the percentage is so low that statement can be applicable)<br/>\n  Secondly, it&#39;s something to do -- and people have been saying that<br/>\n  the new Hate is not doable, which clearly isn&#39;t the case.  Do the<br/>\n  bugged spite golems suck?  They sure do, once you encounter it your<br/>\n  mission is over.  But you can still try up to that point, which was<br/>\n  my point ;)  (If you are lucky, two wizards can IC the pet when it<br/>\n  arrives, thus forcing the spite to create a new unbugged pet.  But<br/>\n  this requires a full party sacrifice as you are rushed)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tLooking around Azarack island, it seems that the spawns are spaced<br/>\n&gt; far enough apart to combat drop in.  We&#39;ll see, when my guild gets over<br/>\n&gt; their recent apathy for doing anything big we&#39;ll probably be back in sky.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I believe Vektor key&#39;d in and was instantly swarmed.  Many changes <br/>\n  have been introduced in this new Sky version; I wouldnt doubt that<br/>\n  Verant has increased the difficulty of the area to prevent players<br/>\n  from getting too far before expansion.  Again, to my knowledge no<br/>\n  server has gotten very far in Sky after the recent upgrade.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tOne of the major failings I&#39;ve seen with non-LoD dragon raids is<br/>\n&gt; that the invite have generally been to people &quot;45+&quot;.  Honestly, that&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; good enough.  The difference between 24 level 45+ people and 24 level 50<br/>\n&gt; people is enormous.  If someone wants to organize a dragon raid, the<br/>\n&gt; people who go should be restricted to 49+, and the number of people kept<br/>\n&gt; under 30.  Make those * hard * caps, and resist the urge to invite<br/>\n&gt; additional friends to come.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Well, I completely agree with you here, however I have almost no<br/>\n  say in the matter when I see L44 rogues and L39 warriors at the<br/>\n  events.  I also suggested that (from this list) people be required<br/>\n  to have a certain degree of resistance or they would not be allowed<br/>\n  to participate.  Again, very little control of the matter, since <br/>\n  I&#39;m not a recognized leader on the server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve done Vox twice recently with 1 bard.  I think our equipment<br/>\n&gt; is getting to the point where bards are more of a bonus than a necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  That was my issue with resistances and where exactly a bard fits into<br/>\n  the dragon picture.  In the end, bards are not necessary for dragon<br/>\n  attacks, despite what Verant seems to believe.  While you will not<br/>\n  break 200 resistance without a bard, does 200 mean anything more than<br/>\n  150? more than 100?  Most planar gear is irrelevant to cold resist,<br/>\n  most suits get one piece that gives +10, some with two bracers that<br/>\n  give +5 to +7.  A warrior in full indo only gets +14 to cold.  The<br/>\n  rings, the crown, the fork, the cloak, etc are what give the most<br/>\n  significant contribution to cold, and then add the resist spell on top.<br/>\n  A warrior is looking to have a base(25/35) + items(84) + spell.  So at<br/>\n  most you are going to get around the 160-170 range sans bard.  Is that<br/>\n  enough?  I dunno, I&#39;ve been in there with 230, didn&#39;t make much <br/>\n  difference to me.  Yet, bard instruments drop from dragons, where <br/>\n  honestly, bards are just kinda an afterthought nowadays even in <br/>\n  groups who are not as decked out in cold gear.  They&#39;d rather have<br/>\n  another cleric or another warrior in the bard slot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This confusion over resistances is what Verant needs to dispel.<br/>\n  I&#39;d like to feel useful during a dragon attack, but not if adding<br/>\n  another 60 or so resistance isn&#39;t helping.  Or there may be a hard<br/>\n  resistance cap that we don&#39;t know about it makes bards look less<br/>\n  useful in the grand scheme.  We already know Verant screwed casters<br/>\n  on the 200 wis/int limit.  How long did that go unmentioned while<br/>\n  some wizards were boasting 230/240 int.  Oh btw, any int over 200<br/>\n  is useless.  doh.  hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m willing to bet that there is the same thing at play here.<br/>\n  We just don&#39;t know it yet.  I have yet to see for myself the<br/>\n  impact of high resistance on dragons, though I would agree<br/>\n  using it wont hurt me, I still want to know the formula involved<br/>\n  with checking and using the resistance number in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
