If I have something already<br/>\ntargeted (whether player or mob), I get bugged alot.  It&#39;s easy for<br/>\nme to keep my Target clear, but unfortunately, it&#39;s hard for my<br/>\ngroup. :/  Is there a command to clear your Target?  It&#39;d be nice to<br/>\ntoss that into the /assist hotkey.  Also, if I /assist too early<br/>\n(before the tank hits autoattack), I usually get something targeted<br/>\nthat&#39;s halfway across the zone.  It&#39;s strange.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve run into the same cranky Enchanters, heh... I know it must get<br/>\nfrustrating on a very large raid because there&#39;s so many people who<br/>\ncan possibly make a mistake, but they do need to understand<br/>\nthat /assist doesn&#39;t work 100%.  They need to play a Melee class to<br/>\nsee how it works before screaming at everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO, my biggest complaint is when the main tank goes AFK or is busy<br/>\ndoing something!!!  Nothing is more annoying than hearing someone<br/>\nchew out the whole raid about using assist properly, when the freakin<br/>\ntank can&#39;t do his job!  I&#39;ve started adding a /bonk or /bleed to<br/>\nmy /assist hotkey, so I&#39;ll bonk or bleed on the target, or on nothing<br/>\nREPEATEDLY if the tanks not doing his job.  And I mean repeatedly.<br/>\n&lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox looks for something to bonk!<br/>\nDarkfox bonks uber_mob_who_drops_phat_lewt00 on the head!<br/>\n<br/>\nGratz on 50, Slyde!<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nFinally closing in on 53 on Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
