Seems<br/>\nto me that most people here are actually adults.  :)  Anyway, enough patting<br/>\non the back, I have a quick question.  Just made level 16 last night hunting<br/>\nin Crushbone.  I got a few more kills for insurance sake and set off to get<br/>\nthe Ayre.  Went to High Keep, got the song, scribed it, memorized it, and<br/>\nwent back to Faydwer.  My question is, what if I were to die enough to lose<br/>\na level?  Would I lose the song completely, just not be able to memorize it,<br/>\nor what?  Haven&#39;t seen any discussion on this and was just wondering if<br/>\nanyone has experienced this yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are on Veeshan give me a tell and say hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurik<br/>\n16th Bard<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n(No witty description for Kurik yet)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
