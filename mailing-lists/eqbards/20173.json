I was invited to join them.  So<br/>\nour group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us bards were around<br/>\nlevel 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs for all of us<br/>\nto twist 3 songs each.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than that, he was just<br/>\nmedding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  He commented<br/>\non that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>\nthe ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was the enchanter.<br/>\nJust thought it was funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nBard of 26 Winces<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
