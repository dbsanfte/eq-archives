I very much enjoyed clomping him with a few others. When I went to CB, it<br/>\nwas 7 am eastern, and there were only 3 people in the zone higher then level 15.<br/>\nA level 17 wiz, a 21 ranger, and myself, a 19 Bard. We grouped together, had to<br/>\nclear the entire castle ourselves (not really that hard, all the legionaires were<br/>\ngreen at 19th) then kill the royal guard. Fortunately for us Dvinn spawned after<br/>\nwe&#39;d been able to bring Crush and the Prohpet into the main throne room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seriously doubt I am the only one who likes to get special item firsthand, and<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean by paying for them. I found the whole time I spent getting the<br/>\nDragoon Dirk to be alot of fun. Yes, we killed DVinn a second time so that the<br/>\nwizard could have one, and I was wow&#39;d by the fact the dagger had better stats<br/>\nthen my Combine Long Sword. But as long as fighting the upper caste of Crushbone<br/>\nisn&#39;t reduced to sitting and waiting for them with 20 other players, I must say<br/>\nit was a VERY rewarding fight from an enjoyment perspective. Take THAT Dvinn! And<br/>\nDorn watch out, you&#39;re next! *smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
