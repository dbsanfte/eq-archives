And if it&#39;s<br/>\nlow at all, it&#39;s certainly not too low to be useful.  I think it&#39;s perfect<br/>\nfor what they intended.  They intended it to be not as good as a full<br/>\nfledged forager would have.  I forage way more than enough food, and just<br/>\nslightly less than enough water to keep me alive.  So I can forage enough<br/>\nberrires and fruit and such to give to my brewing friends, and still have<br/>\nplenty of food to eat.  I don&#39;t mind that I have to buy water every so<br/>\noften, since characters without forage at all have to do it a lot more<br/>\noften.  I think those who think it is useless are either too lazy to press<br/>\nthe button often enough, or have a case of sour grapes (or is that berries?)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, Half-Elf bard of E&#39;Ci  Capped at 40 forage, and grateful<br/>\nto have forage at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:20 PM 9/24/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 10:57 AM 9/24/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GGillan@...\">GGillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far.
