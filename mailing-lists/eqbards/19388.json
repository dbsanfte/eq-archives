Usefull if you get an &quot;add&quot; while chant<br/>\nkiting a single.  Your&#39;s is good for dealing with crowds.  I have fired off<br/>\nfear in a couple dungeons in Kunark - pathing gets real wierd and I have<br/>\nonly done it as last ditch move after evac or zone has been called.<br/>\nOutdoors, it prolly works better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing you do want to watch for is the &#39;agro accumulation&#39; effect.<br/>\nIf you start seeing faction messages from stuff that you are not killing,<br/>\nbeaware that you are getting transferred to other mobs hate lists.<br/>\nSometimes large, spontaneous trains have been created this way.  I harken<br/>\nback to the days in Unrest pulling to the wall because we were too low to<br/>\nhold rooms in the house.  Zone out every 20-30 minutes was the rule - more<br/>\nlike superstition.  But it sure seemed like after 45-60 minutes the next<br/>\npull would be a real dooozey!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.
