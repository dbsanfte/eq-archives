At<br/>\nfirst, I thought maybe it wasn&#39;t the same thing. I checked the stats, tho,<br/>\nand it has the same stats as the &quot;Demon Claw&quot; I have seen so many speak of.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it is an effort in Verant&#39;s part to remove &quot;Demon&quot;, &quot;Devil&quot;, or any<br/>\nother type of &quot;no-no&quot; word from their game. Or perhaps it is just an attempt<br/>\nto give a neat weapon a neater name (Smile).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only wish was that we could use TWO of these, run around like wanna-be<br/>\nWolverine super-heroes.
