Any of the rooms/places where you<br/>\ncan kill bats and bugs.  I had a healer (cleric) in the group and the puller<br/>\nwould bring as many as he could.  With 3 mobs, playing lute for Chords of<br/>\nDisonance, Chords of Cessation, swap to horn for Denons, rinse repeat.  By<br/>\nthe tine the first mob was dead, the second would be nearly down to half<br/>\nhealth.  By the time the 2nd one was dead, the third one would be way below<br/>\nhalf health.  You do need a healer but the efficiency of AE DoT songs shines<br/>\n- and the dragon/god instruments really help.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn other occasions, I will use the Vox horn with Berserker&#39;s to add some<br/>\ndramatic STR stats when ppl in the group are begging for str buffs (rogues,<br/>\netc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 13, 2000 9:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Elfson the Dargonslayer Part2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter our successful hit on Nagafen we decided to take on Lady Vox and the<br/>\nIce Giants last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne complete heal (doh!)
