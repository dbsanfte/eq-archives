Maybe you should take into consideration that many of us read the<br/>\nentire post and then, with considerable experience of Verant&#39;s past<br/>\nhistory on positive changes, discounted that part completely. We&#39;re<br/>\nstill waiting for the improvements to PoS that they promised they&#39;d look<br/>\nat 5 months ago. Verant has a long, consistant history of foot dragging<br/>\non postitive improvements. As well, 5 mobs is really a stretch. The mere<br/>\nfact that they admit to specifically tuning 5 mobs to expected use of<br/>\nthe BP shows they had an expectation of it being used when designing<br/>\nencounters in Velious, and many more than 5 show this, from my guild&#39;s<br/>\nexperiences in fighting them<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m actually in agreement that the BP was overpowered, but only in that<br/>\ncomplete heal is the most unbalancing spell in the game. What I&#39;m not in<br/>\nagreement with is blindly accepting everything VI says. I would have<br/>\nthough someone playing a Bard would have more experience with VI&#39;s<br/>\nability to distort the facts at will.
