Let your imagination a<br/>\n&gt;bit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>\n&gt;MIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>\n&gt;for a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sadly, no. There is no &#39;music&#39; per se. At one point early in world, the<br/>\ngods talked of offering this possibility, but I do not expect it any time soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>\n&gt;to read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>\n&gt;to type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>\n&gt;command macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll give you a quick answer and access to a longer one here, about<br/>\ntechnique. In the short, you can use macros, but you&#39;ll probably find them<br/>\nwoefully inadequate for a song of any length. Also, although I wished we<br/>\nhad some better command for &#39;singing&#39;, having to type each line kind of<br/>\nsimulates true skill required  in performance, if you treat typos as missed<br/>\nnotes and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more of my rambling about performance, see a writing I provided for our<br/>\nstudents in the Soerbaird library:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com/iona/singingconcerts.htm\">http://www.soerbaird.com/iona/singingconcerts.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nListen and Live!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
