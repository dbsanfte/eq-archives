I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>\nI was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>\nsilly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>\ninto him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>\ndirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>\nweapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>\ndid.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>\ninterrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>\nwas getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>\nenough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>\ntoo powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>\nof envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>\nnever felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 2 Aug 1999, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work!  Granted, I was in an ingredible laggy zone, was experiencing a great<br/>\n&gt; amount of packet loss, and the wizard was running around, slippery little<br/>\n&gt; bugger (half the time I&#39;d see him standing one place when in reality my<br/>\n&gt; client was wrong and he was somewhere else).
