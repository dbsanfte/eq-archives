For me 20-27<br/>\nwere the worse levels, I felt like I was useless (MM fustration, lack of<br/>\ngood groups, as has been said the learning curve part, a/k/a dying, sucks)<br/>\nbecause I was reduced to doing the pets.  But I got over it and just<br/>\ngrounded out 25-27 there, at 27th I hit Cazic (*love* that place, TR is one<br/>\nof the best camps peroid), at 32nd I hit upper guk (a vastly untapped pit of<br/>\nxp), at 35 the BR to get over hell (did it in 2 night ;), at 37 (did 36th<br/>\nthe same night) the undead tower and from there on out the live keep and<br/>\nusual named undead froggies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it funny now that I think about it to see the &quot;lguk&quot; people and the<br/>\n&quot;solb&quot; people? =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n[Tork@Nameless]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
