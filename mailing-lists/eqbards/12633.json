Someone said that 125 doesn&#39;t have any impact, but 225<br/>\n&gt;   does.  heh.  It&#39;s my opinion, as I have seen with every single other<br/>\n&gt;   mob in this game that regardless of resistance, you are gonna be<br/>\n&gt;   lucky and unlucky at times on damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is that so hard to believe, that 225 would make a difference where 125 does<br/>\nnot?  or did i read that wrong.  you&#39;re killing me, Harm!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hell, ice goblin wizards<br/>\n&gt;   can still cast their stupid shock spells on me for almost<br/>\n&gt;   full dmg, despite the fact I play mystic shielding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t they be ice-based spells, where mystic shielding is MR only?  my<br/>\nwiz has a frost shock spell at level 24 and an ice shock spell at 34.  i&#39;m<br/>\nassuming they would cast something like that being ice goblin wizzies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m not downplaying resistances, but there is some luck factor<br/>\n&gt;   involved which skews everything at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sounds like you are =P<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   LoD had one bard (blue to me, poorly equiped) Sagnaria (sp) and<br/>\n&gt;   Weadeneye... that was it.
