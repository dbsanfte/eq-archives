After an extensive review of combat head injuries in<br/>\npast wars, the newly redesigned U.S. Army helmets look a lot<br/>\nlike the German WWII helmets (better protection around the<br/>\ntemples and back), minus the spire on top.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you try on a plate helm, you may decide the banded/BI<br/>\nhelm look is not so bad. :-)  As alternatives, you could get<br/>\na leatherfoot skullcap (quest turning in a dirk, +10 to<br/>\ncharisma) which has the look of leather.  Or you could get a<br/>\nfine silk turban from Hatar (L20 sand giant, rare spawn,<br/>\nturban is AC 10 and does not show up on your avatar).  Be<br/>\nprepared to pay though - high fashion comes at a price.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
