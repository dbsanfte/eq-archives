So they can<br/>\neither float away from danger, or get down on the ground and attack, but<br/>\nthey can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tParalto of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: scott brisko [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess would be that in the orignal design you could levitate and attack<br/>\nfrom on-high with little or no risk when attacking a melee only mob. When<br/>\nthey went in to &quot;fix&quot; this and created our little z-axis bug, they really<br/>\nhad no way to effectively block mob&#39;s at different elevations or through<br/>\nfloors and walls from getting hit with songs/spell effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasicially what Verant would have to do is implement some sort of colission<br/>\ndetection code that would stop the songs effects from passing through the<br/>\nenironment where their are barriers (walls, floors). Of course if they got<br/>\nreally fancy they could try to model sound waves and how they would bounce<br/>\noff the surfaces. Imagine singing Denon&#39;s down a long echoing corridor!<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
