It&#39;s obviously nothing compared to a song like Verses of<br/>\nVictory or Hymn of Restoration. I&#39;ve had planes pulls come in while mana<br/>\nregen was being played that walked passed me. I can&#39;t recall ever being<br/>\nmobbed for only playing that song. If I go afk, even if a pull might be<br/>\ncoming in, I&#39;ll leave mana regen playing for the fight, so I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nif it&#39;s just a matter of someone else having a higher aggro factor in<br/>\nthe room than me or what.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; dunno if i thought about it or just did it instinctively, but like you<br/>\n&gt; said<br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t play any buffs during pulls.  i play mana song all the way til<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; pull is in, then i start up with buffs.  pretty sure mana song is no<br/>\n&gt; taunt,<br/>\n&gt; right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L35 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
