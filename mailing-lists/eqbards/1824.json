Using mana for DDD was just a way of putting a<br/>\nrather long delay on it.  They could&#39;ve given it to as a skill<br/>\nthat cycled every hour or so (like Lay Hands), but it makes<br/>\nmore sense to make it a song and use mana to incorporate the<br/>\ndelay.  (They could&#39;ve just greyed out the song icon until the<br/>\ntime had cycled, but then you&#39;d end up memorizing the song,<br/>\nthinking &quot;#&!@ it still hasn&#39;t cycled,&quot; and forgetting it for<br/>\nanother song.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral combat skills (e.g. monk special attacks) are<br/>\nexclusive of each other - if you use one, it starts the delay<br/>\ntimer for all.  Having multiple one-shot bard songs which used<br/>\nmana would be the same thing, except we have a nice blue<br/>\nprogress bar showing when we can use it again instead of<br/>\nhaving to glance at our watch and note the time every time we<br/>\nuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe *only* reason I&#39;d like meditate is so that it doesn&#39;t take<br/>\nus 10 times longer to memorize a song than it does for a<br/>\nspellcaster to memorize spells (if you haven&#39;t played a<br/>\nspellcaster, you auto-meditate when memorizing and the bar<br/>\nmoves in huge increments of about 20% - takes about 4 seconds<br/>\nto memorize the most difficult spell you have).  When my<br/>\ncleric friend and I died, she memorized her spells, conjured<br/>\nup a new hammer of wrath, crossed two zones to get from the<br/>\nbank to the gate (where I was), and I was still memorizing my<br/>\nsongs.  Surely after memorizing these songs so often, we&#39;d get<br/>\npretty good at it?  Just one point in meditate - that won&#39;t<br/>\nhelp mana regeneration will it?  Please please pretty please?<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
