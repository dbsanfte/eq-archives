I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>\n&gt;you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>\n&gt;players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>\n&gt;real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>\n&gt;anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Infiniti<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is happening because you are on a pvp server i think. I jumped on <br/>\nRallos Zek during beta while my regular server (Fennin Ro - BLAH) was down <br/>\njust to see what it was like. Of course i was getting beat up by some pk <br/>\nmonk in the newbie zone, but after i made lvl 2 it actually was kinda fun. I <br/>\nwould sing dissonance and strafe around him, and he couldn&#39;t keep up with me <br/>\n(quake skills CAN be useful in EQ I guess when fighting other players).<br/>\nI also was talking to a group who wanted me to join them and had wince on. <br/>\nThey were panicing cuz they didn&#39;t know why they were takng damage (all of <br/>\nthem). Of course after I joined the group they no longer took damage. You <br/>\njust have to be careful with it on Zek.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 14th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
