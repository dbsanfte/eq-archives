They will never be able<br/>\nto do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally ignore<br/>\nthe lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the game<br/>\nfar too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new stuff.<br/>\nAlthough those players play the game more they don&#39;t pay any more than the<br/>\nlower level players.  I have lost close to 20 guild members just in my guild<br/>\nbecause they were tired of Verant only doing things for level 46+ players.<br/>\nEventually at this rate Verant will only have those level 46+ players left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 21, 2000 9:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually you get to play a new class so not boring.

This might keep you guys<br/>\n&gt;busy until expansion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My points about neglecting 46- level characters is still valid however.<br/>\n&gt;Since this game has been out, players have consistently begged Verant to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>add<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;more quality quests to the game.  With the exception of the class armor<br/>\n&gt;quests, most of the other quests for low and medium level characters flat<br/>\n&gt;out suck and aren&#39;t worth the time and effort.  Is it too much to expect<br/>\n&gt;that as the game evolves over time, Verant will make improvements to all<br/>\n&gt;aspects of the game?  You yourself stated the 50 level players are bored so<br/>\n&gt;thats why they start twink characters.  It sure would be nice if those<br/>\n&gt;twinks had something different to look forward to (new items and quests).<br/>\n&gt;As it stands now, all they get to do is the stuff their 50th level<br/>\n </span></blockquote>character<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;has probably already done countless times over.

This is a major problem and they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; need<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just complaining<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that they don&#39;t get anything new added.

I assume the 200+ class<br/>\n&gt;&gt; specific<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;items Abashi referred to were the 84 quest reward items and the 252+/-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; quest<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;components.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Rant on:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; do.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;With the exception of the class armor quests added a few months back and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;loot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (past<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;few months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;aware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium<br/>\n&gt;&gt; level<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;characters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Verant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;45- characters. Am I out of line thinking this way?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Caveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;usuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Its also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;high level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Rant off<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;32 bard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
