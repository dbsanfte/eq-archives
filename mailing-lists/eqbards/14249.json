I think this claim is valid,<br/>\nas we have way too much evidence to show that no testing is done on the<br/>\nbard before patching at all. Even testing of changes specific to the<br/>\nbard. What other explanation is there for the fact that they go live<br/>\nwith code where new bard songs don&#39;t work, levitate changes completely<br/>\nbreak the bard levitate song and other problems we&#39;ve seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting thing I haven&#39;t seen anyone comment on. Last<br/>\n(emergency) patch they said they had to put in some changes half<br/>\nfinished when they put in the fixes for the network code, i.e. the necro<br/>\npet changes. Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>\nthey don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>\nallow patching of the currently running code so they didn&#39;t have to go<br/>\nlive with partly finished changes?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
