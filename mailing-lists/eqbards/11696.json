On a similar","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-514828434\">I read a long time ago on this list (think John Kim posted it) that lizzies,<br/>\ngiant skeles, etc are indeed placeholders for giants in Rathe Mtns.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a similar note, I think the same holds true for the bears and lizards<br/>\nthat spawn near the Lake zone. I was there last night with a cyclops hunting<br/>\ngroup.  After we killed all the cycylops that were there, there was a long<br/>\ntime before another cyclops ever appeared.  Whole bunch of bears were<br/>\nwalking around though.  I remembered the placeholder post from a while back<br/>\nso we killed several grizzlies and kodiaks.  Within a couple of minutes, a<br/>\ncouple of cyclops spawned.  Everytime a bear spawned afterwards we killed<br/>\nit.  As a result, It was nonstop cyclops slaughter all night long.  Only<br/>\ndown time was when the casters had to med.  One other cool thing about<br/>\nhunting cyclops near the lake zone.  If you have a good party (we had five<br/>\npeople, all high 20s/low 30s and well-balanced classwise), you can kill<br/>\nTarskuk nonstop.  Tarskuk is a NPC cyclops that I think is somewhere in the<br/>\n30s.  As soon as you kill him, he immediately respawns.  Once again, the<br/>\nonly downtime you will incur is for casters to med.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I make 30th level, I plan on making this spot my home until I get out<br/>\nof hell level.  I heard that Highkeep basement was the best place to safely<br/>\nget out of 30th hell level because of its safety factor but I think camping<br/>\ncyclops by the Lake zone in Rathe may actually be better (assuming you<br/>\ncanget in a group).  You have the zone for the safety factor plus the<br/>\ncyclops spawn rate is much faster than pickclaws.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Steven S.

I couldn&#39;t see any evidence that lizzies are placeholders for<br/>\n&gt; giants.  Killing many didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; increase the spawn of giants.  The giant skels definitely are, however.<br/>\n&gt; Seriously though, with me and<br/>\n&gt; that 45th level wizard working the hill (and I&#39;m pretty sure we were the<br/>\n&gt; only ones there) there were no<br/>\n&gt; hill giants or skeletons on that hil.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave Gaines wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say a level 45 wizard can do a good job of keeping<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; HGs cleared or not.
