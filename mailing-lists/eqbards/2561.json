I am still on this<br/>\nlist but my level 26 bard languishes. I have<br/>\nfound I need a game that I can have some fun<br/>\nin for 40 minutes and then turn it off if<br/>\nneed be. EQ is an awesome, incredible game,<br/>\nbut if you are even a little power hungry<br/>\nlike I am it can become insanely demanding<br/>\non your time. I can distinctly recall when<br/>\ngames that offered 100 hours of potential<br/>\nadventuring were considered great in terms<br/>\nof entertainment value for the dollar. EQ offers<br/>\nat least a thousand hours (if you consider<br/>\ngetting 50th an endpoint/goal), and for me<br/>\nit&#39;s just too damn much. Figure that you<br/>\nspend about 2,000 hours a year working for<br/>\na living at 40 hour work weeks and you begin<br/>\nto see the ridiculously slow pace EQ has.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I would love to get level 50,<br/>\nslay every monster several times (not 300), and<br/>\nhave a lot of fun. The problem is I can&#39;t devote<br/>\nmy life to eq, and if there was a way to cheat<br/>\nin order to accelerate my adventures/progress<br/>\nthrough the game, I would find it tempting to<br/>\nuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, keep up the interesting messages -<br/>\nI am now experiencing eq vicariously<br/>\nthrough your stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nBerk, mostly retired level 26 bard of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjb@...\">jjb@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjb@...\">jjb@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 28, 1999 6:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] EQ slang<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjb@...\">jjb@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Well hot damn, that means when I get lung cancer from smoking all these<br/>\n&gt; years that I can sue the people who made them! It&#39;s not MY fault that I<br/>\n&gt; bought them in the store, not my fault I lit a bunch of crushed up plants<br/>\n&gt; held together with chemically treated paper, which the paper is held round<br/>\n&gt; with glue, then stuck the fiberglass type material in my mouth and sucked<br/>\n&gt; on it while the opposite end was glowing red. Woohoo, using SaTaN, ahem,<br/>\n&gt; excuse me, s8n&#39;s, logic, I&#39;m bound to be a millionaire.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  OR<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  when you grow up you&#39;ll be able to tell the difference between right and<br/>\n&gt; wrong, between knowing what&#39;s the correct course of actions<br/>\n&gt; without someone<br/>\n&gt; telling you what they are. Or maybe some other kid wanting to blame<br/>\n&gt; everyone else for thier bullshit will shoot you (so they can be as cool as<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;gangsta&#39;s&quot;) and your parents can sue the company that made the gun.<br/>\n&gt; (since it won&#39;t be the kid who pulled the trigger&#39;s fault, no need to even<br/>\n&gt; put him in jail)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 06:30 PM 6/28/99 EDT, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrS8N@...\">MrS8N@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are<br/>\n&gt; certain creatures<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who get caught in walls when you lure them there and then you can slowly,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;surely, bellow them to death.  I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question<br/>\n&gt; are mostly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found<br/>\n&gt; this spot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them<br/>\n&gt; and get on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that<br/>\n&gt; I--or anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is<br/>\n&gt; using your head<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of wacko<br/>\n&gt; &gt;powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass<br/>\n&gt; &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.<br/>\n&gt; Play how they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and<br/>\n&gt; epitomy of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only<br/>\n&gt; problem I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple<br/>\n&gt; people mind your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you<br/>\n&gt; see someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;playing the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cooter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;21st no matter how I got here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;We&#39;ve just added a &quot;NO ATTACHMENTS&quot; option.
