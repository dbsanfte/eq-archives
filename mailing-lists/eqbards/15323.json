The guy claiming it worked great for him in Runnyeye<br/>\nposted a logfile with a sample size of 456 (good enough for<br/>\nme).  He got a 10% primary resist rate, and a 28% secondary<br/>\nresist rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would support the theory that there&#39;s a sign error in the<br/>\nsecondary resist check - r goes up as R goes down.  But since<br/>\nr+R = approx constant, the song still seems as ineffective to<br/>\nyou.  Please do the test and send me the logfile.  Even if<br/>\nyour overall resist rate is the same as mine, the difference<br/>\nin r and R may be enough to prove a sign error.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
