Try the spider webs near FV zone as there&#39;s lotsa<br/>\nwidows/recluse there. As well as roaming petrified birds there with other<br/>\nstuff.  Sadly, I&#39;ve found that in the wee hours of the morning dreadlands<br/>\nand karnors have been the easiest spots to find a group/solo. Which ever was<br/>\nmy mood that morning.  I know there are better spots but I don&#39;t like<br/>\nwasting my time running around/gating in order to get to  these spots and<br/>\nseeing that they&#39;re camped.  One of these spots being the bloodgills in lake<br/>\nof ill omen. They&#39;re great xp and you can tank them and go toe to toe with<br/>\nthem. I finished my level 49 on them.  Have about 6 ancient coins sitting in<br/>\nthe bank from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: March 5, 2001 4:14 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] High Level Blues<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, anyone have good spots for experience at 48-50ish?
