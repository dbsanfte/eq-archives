I was corrected. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know there have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been petitions and letters sent to GZ and such, but I haven&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; participated in any of them as of yet. Normally I just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feedback any opinions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i have on the game, but even as a write one I feel like I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasting my time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If anyone has a current petition why don&#39;t you add the skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cap and ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parry to be added to bards on it. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
