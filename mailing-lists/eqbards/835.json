I am tired of +attack spd, +AC, dmg etc.  Chant of Battle <br/>\nand Anthem de Arms are almost indestinguishable in effect as far as I <br/>\ncan tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is <br/>\nbetter to use then the other.  Chord of Dissonance gives me no <br/>\nindication of much much dmg I do and if I choose not to juggle then I <br/>\ngive up STR and AC to use it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I am trying to decide what the right song or combination of <br/>\nsongs to use are based on the situation and verant (I hate them) gives <br/>\nus no idea what the songs actually do.  As most of our songs work on <br/>\nthe group as a whole it is nearly impossible to determine whether I am <br/>\nhelping or my teammates or if they just happen to be making good die <br/>\nrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I have just taken to juggling between anthem, chant, and CoD <br/>\nwhile wading into battle.  Just made 12th but have not purchased many <br/>\nsongs above 7th lvl.  Asside from healing (with mandolin) during or <br/>\nafter battle my groups have not been overly enthused about the bard <br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy with the class have intrument and song juggling down pat be <br/>\nhave no clue as to when to sing and wade in or stand back and play?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last note is it true that song 11 and 14 do not work.  If so that <br/>\nreally blows.  We only get 1 song a level (most of which are truely <br/>\nuseless I only use 4 songs now and I am 12th level for cripes sake and <br/>\nnow I get double screwed at 11 and 14th?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Richard A.
