The few times it worked it kept one mob standing<br/>\naround for about 10 seconds. If that&#39;s all it does, I dont see why you&#39;d<br/>\nuse it instead of charm, which basically does the same thing with the<br/>\nadded bonus that you can have the mob attack it&#39;s friends for those 10<br/>\nseconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone found some use for Pixie Strike I may have missed?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
