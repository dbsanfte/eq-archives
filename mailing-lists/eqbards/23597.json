I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1791578785\">actually you&#39;re right, the hall is echoing alot of whining lately more and<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fix this and fix that threads are becoming a wee bit too heavy.  I<br/>\npersonnally just want to be left in peace. I&#39;ve grown accustomed to playing<br/>\nwithout songs that are broken/not working well.  If they fix em fine, if<br/>\nthey dont fine as well.  Feel like the info request threads are being thrown<br/>\noff first page so fast because of &quot;balancing&quot; threads.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, on another note, all you old bards out there, I was in beta 3-4,<br/>\nMinkin&#39;s creation date is april 99 and still isnt 50 (nearing though) with<br/>\nabout 40 days played.  So I&#39;ve seen all the nerfs and all the crap.  Hell<br/>\nwhen i got around level 35 got so sick of hell level i made a necro and got<br/>\nit to 50 in 17 days.  Eventually, they lowered bard hate, fixed a few things<br/>\nand nerfed a few others.  All in all, big deal, the class is better off then<br/>\nit used to be by a landslide and it kind of saddens me to see there are some<br/>\nout there that badly represent the class, but that doesnt mean they&#39;re the<br/>\ngeneral population. <br/>\n<br/>\nA whiny clueless voice is more probable to get your ears attention then a<br/>\nsoothing whisper of wisdom and sadly, that is what happens on message<br/>\nboards.   Go to any board and start 2 threads, one stating that &quot;such and<br/>\nsuch is great&quot; and another stating &quot;such and such sucks&quot; and i guarantee you<br/>\nthat the second one grows to monster proportions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\n47 bard<br/>\nA Sol Ro bard that migrated to Ayonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gordon Hughes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ghughes@...\">ghughes@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: January 26, 2001 4:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Chances are the bard is one of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;be very helpful in the group.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find any of those Bards here.  I&#39;m of the opinion that<br/>\nthis list is one of the last bastions of the serious Bard on the net.  Even<br/>\nthe Concert Hall is slipping into the depths of whinedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us here know the differences between a good and bad Bard.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nmean to sound uncaring of your predicament, but you&#39;re preaching to the<br/>\nconverted.  Your attitude to Bards is typical of many people who have<br/>\nsuffered at the hands of a few bad apples.  Since you&#39;ve already gotten to<br/>\nlevel 50 yourself, why not invite one of those Bards you so frequently pass<br/>\nup and offer to teach them a few tricks of the trade?  No-one likes to be<br/>\ntold that they&#39;re doing wrong, but if you offer ways to improve their<br/>\ntechniques, making the group more efficient, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a much<br/>\nbetter time of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
