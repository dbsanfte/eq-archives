The screenshot of the gypsy lute says +5 Sv <br/>\n&gt; Magic which makes me want one simply for that fact.  I&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; curious if anyone gets their hands on this, if maybe this is <br/>\n&gt; the equal to the Mistmoore Battle drum (I know this is <br/>\n&gt; probably just a fantasy. . . but hey, this is a fantasy game huh? =).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now as to this lute in relation to the quest.  I do not know <br/>\n&gt; where the Gypsy Lute comes from except one a person said, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;off a named gypsy musician&quot;.  I do not know if this person <br/>\n&gt; is in Mistmoore.  I would hope so.  The quest [clue] of &quot;a <br/>\n&gt; Gypsy Lute from the Castle of Mistmoore,&quot; is otherwise wrong. <br/>\n&gt;  And while EverQuest is an amazing game, we&#39;ve all had our <br/>\n&gt; own experiences with Verant that a mistake like this wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; surprise us.  I just hope they reimburse Shada and others <br/>\n&gt; that encountered this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kassao, 27th Bard of Tarew Marr&#92; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
