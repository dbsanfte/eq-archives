VERY","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1482511177\">This is an interesting discussion, and it would be interesting to verify<br/>\nthis.  I only have an 85 cha, and my bellow hardly ever gets resisted<br/>\neither.  VERY occasionally a yellow will resist, and reds more than that.<br/>\nWith whites and below, I&#39;d say my bellow does max damage 80% of the time.<br/>\nI am currently level 17.  I would suspect the CHA to factor into charm more<br/>\nthan anything else, so maybe this doesn&#39;t really apply to bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:48 PM 5/19/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wed, 19 May 1999, Scott Pickle wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but when using bellow, I tried kiting a yellow<br/>\n&gt;&gt; beetle, and was never once resisted. In fact, I don&#39;t recall having been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resisted with bellow. I maxed out my charisma when I created a character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, that&#39;s been my experience too (110 chr).  I just figured<br/>\n&gt;it was normal.  Ever since I got bellow, I can only think of a<br/>\n&gt;handful of times it&#39;s been resisted by a yellow.  A lot of<br/>\n&gt;times I can use it on reds as well, though high reds (stuff<br/>\n&gt;that singlehandedly nearly wipes out my party) usually resist<br/>\n&gt;it, but I still get a fair number in.  Interestingly, those I<br/>\n&gt;do get in are often near the low end of the damage range,<br/>\n&gt;which supports the guy&#39;s claim that resist and damage are<br/>\n&gt;linked.  Last night I was flabbergasted because a green wisp<br/>\n&gt;resisted bellow three times.  That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had a<br/>\n&gt;green resist it, and suspect Verant cranked up their magic<br/>\n&gt;resist to make it harder to farm them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I suppose the other way to test is to go fight a skunk and get<br/>\n&gt;that nasty -30 chr, and try things then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resistance or &quot;fizzling&quot; a problem with some of you? I seldom miss a note.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Missing notes when you start a song seems to be tied more to<br/>\n&gt;instrument skill.  When you first get a new skill, you will<br/>\n&gt;miss notes a lot.  I *think* dex is tied into how well you can<br/>\n&gt;hold a song when you&#39;re hit.  I have to restart my song every<br/>\n&gt;3-4 hits fighting blue-yellow mobs (stuns excepted) at 90 dex.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
