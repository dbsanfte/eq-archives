In fact, many<br/>\nrangers with yaks would get eaten for lunch by fire giants or dragons<br/>\nbecause they taunted so much, but upon switching to waks, they would often<br/>\nnot only last longer, but sometimes even survive the fight. Finally many<br/>\nrangers who don&#39;t have the mistwalker or the fluxbladed axe choose waks for<br/>\nthe planes since the yak proc is resisted so much and draws undue attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted though, if you have the HP or the AC to survive the additional taunt<br/>\nfactor, yaks are the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

Was Claw Hype<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSar I dunno about Bards, I&#39;ve never bothered with Yaks myself ;)  But as a<br/>\nRanger I can guarantee that a Y&#39;kesha vastly out damages a wakizashi.<br/>\nRangers have done a lot of testing of log files, combat durations, solo<br/>\nfights, what they can and cannot kill with the various weapons etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to re-hash those discussions here but suffice to say the<br/>\nY&#39;kesha, every time, out dammaged the Wakizashi by enough that we all agreed<br/>\nthat we were better off with a Y&#39;kesha over a Wakizashi.  The Wakizashi&#39;s<br/>\ndmg output is not significant enough during a fight to out-dmg a y&#39;kesha<br/>\nonce the Y&#39;kesha procs.  Remember, Rangers have Dual Wield AND Double<br/>\nAttack, so they tend to proc more often than us when using them.  My Ranger<br/>\nproc&#39;s between 3 and 5 times a fight.  So 3*70 or 5*70 additional dmg.  Many<br/>\nrangers average higher (My ranger&#39;s dex is horrible (&lt;80)) and I still<br/>\nregularly proc 5 times a fight.  A ranger with 100 dex will *regularly* proc<br/>\nbetween 4 and 7 times a fight. Sometimes more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao!  As I said the rangers discussed it.  The numbers may be different for<br/>\nBards since we don&#39;t have Double Attack or the Rangers THAC0 table and thus<br/>\nhit a LOT less often.  But I suspect people will find that the Y&#39;kesha will<br/>\nstill edge the Waki&#39;s out in dmg.  Though not by nearly as much as it did<br/>\nfor rangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this clears up my post ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ L<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 31, 2000 11:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Waki or Yaki... Was Claw Hype<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My prime reason for chucking my yaks is the taunt factor. I am usually on<br/>\n&gt; larger raids lately where any taunting onto me is usually not a good<br/>\nthing,<br/>\n&gt; and best kept to a minimum (i.e., &quot;an ire ghast feels the force of ykesha,<br/>\n&gt; an ire ghast hits YOU for 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hits YOU for<br/>\n&gt; 120 points of damage! an ire ghast hi....a_purple_cleric says to the<br/>\nparty,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;aw geez there goes my mana&quot;...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other than that they weigh half as much as a Ykesha, they are no drop (no<br/>\n&gt; worries of them slipping between the cracks of my hotkeyed inventory<br/>\nboxes),<br/>\n&gt; and yes they DO look nice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as damage comparisons: I have to completely disagree with the<br/>\nnotion<br/>\n&gt; that Yaks will SIGNIFICANTLY outdamage Waks even if you only get 1 proc.<br/>\n&gt; Waks will generally do more damage OVER TIME. This means little if you are<br/>\n&gt; fighting short battles. In longer fights (such as against 45+ mobs) the<br/>\nproc<br/>\n&gt; vs. wak ratio debate loses steam. When you go to the planes almost all of<br/>\n&gt; these factors come into play. You are dealing with mobs that have upwards<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; 12K hp. Most fights are quite long, the majority of Ykesha procs are<br/>\n&gt; resisted, and the Yaks suck stamina quite nicely in long drawn out fights.<br/>\n&gt; Of course any bard with his mandolin will twist Jig in as needed in any<br/>\n&gt; fight. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I fully agree that it&#39;s personaly preference. Some people live by the<br/>\nproc,<br/>\n&gt; others live by the ratio. After having been beat down more than enough<br/>\ntimes<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve decided to shitcan my Yaks that I&#39;ve owned and loved for 6+ months.<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; let me tell you, my cleric spends a LOT less mana on me, and can worry<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; about keeping the real tanks alive in my party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 50th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Kevin L.
