As for the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1276429843\">It works for me everytime, except for the Aviak merchant in South Karana.  <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t work on him because those Aviaks at SK have NO faction.  As for <br/>\nthe merchant in Oasis, are you talking about the gypsies?  Or the one in the <br/>\ninns?  I think they both have faction, maybe you were on the botherline of <br/>\ndubious and threathening.  So after you play the song, you are still on <br/>\ndubious but almost apprehensive.  If you make it to apprehensive, they will <br/>\nsell to you. But if all else fail, just sneak up to him and buy/sell.  Sneak <br/>\nwill make every merchant indifferent to you.  Every rogue knows this trick!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How are you people using the charismatic carillion?  I have never had it do<br/>\n&gt;anything for me.  After reading all these messages I thought maybe it had<br/>\n&gt;been fixed, so I tried it on a merchant in Oasis of Mar who conned dubious<br/>\n&gt;and refused to sell to me.  I equipped my mino horn, targeted the merchant,<br/>\n&gt;played the carillion, and conned her again.  Still dubious.  Right clicked<br/>\n&gt;her, she still refused to sell to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am level 35 with wind skill either maxed out or close to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
