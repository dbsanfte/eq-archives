On eight <br/>\ndifferent occasions, I have had a negative effect disappear as soon as <br/>\nthe song did its first static charge pulse.  This has only happened on <br/>\nthe first pulse of the song, it has only removed DOT buffs (from Necros, <br/>\nSKs or Shamen), and it has often failed to remove DOT buffs, but the fact <br/>\nthat eight negative buffs have disappeared on the first pulse suggests to <br/>\nme that it may actually be working (it may just be relatively worthless). <br/>\nOr I may be the delusional victim of a misleading, albeit unlikely, <br/>\nseries of coincidences.  ;P   Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
