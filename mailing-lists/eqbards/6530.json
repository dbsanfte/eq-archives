He is now 26th level and I&#39;m a 23d.  He is great at leading a group<br/>\nin combat, both with his spells as well as his tact.  In almost every<br/>\nsituation the two of us group together, our groups have worked like fine<br/>\ntuned engines.  Only when something bad like someone dropping a train on us<br/>\nwill anyone die.  I&#39;ve found only a few other people as good as him at being<br/>\na group leader.  I would also like to think that I&#39;m pretty good at it (I&#39;m<br/>\nin the Army in RL so if I&#39;m not good at leading people your tax dollars are<br/>\ngoing to waste:-).  With that said, if I find myself joining a group with a<br/>\nleader who does not lead or people object when I make suggestions, I am wary<br/>\nabout remaining in the group.  If they keep doing stupid stuff I will<br/>\npolitely leave the group.  If I think my chances of staying alive are pretty<br/>\ngood I will tough it out and hopefully educate them about grouping with a<br/>\nbard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sigh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;Crier stares into the distance imagining what it would be like to have a<br/>\n&gt; group listen to her advice.&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
