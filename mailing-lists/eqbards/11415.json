I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with me - that he<br/>\n&gt; tested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the casters to get<br/>\n&gt; full mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; used up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked the Bard why<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; was doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>\n&gt; words - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>\n&gt; obviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>\n&gt; (Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win situation - if you<br/>\n&gt; tried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have looked like sour<br/>\n&gt; grapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you wanted to!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: G.W.
