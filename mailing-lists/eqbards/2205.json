Lesson one<br/>\nlearned<br/>\n<br/>\nGrouped with a neco in Najena.  Fell in the trap and our group survived<br/>\nthe baddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly to have the injured halfling attack the necros pet.  the necro<br/>\nFeigned and I started invis.  We are fine, right?  nope the invis<br/>\nlapsed on the necro and the halfling attacks him.  he feigns again. <br/>\nnow the halfling is attacking me...  <br/>\n<br/>\nHad to bolt for the exit as I don&#39;t want bad halfling faction. <br/>\nEveryone was following but, in the mess one of the other party members<br/>\ngets stunned and left to die to the nasties of najena.  We were<br/>\nbasically lost and looking for a way out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nthose terrors kill quickly when you are alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 21 Jun 1999, CMai wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Question about the invis song:  Is it possible to<br/>\n&gt; hit something then run far<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away but not zone and hit Invis, will the mob that<br/>\n&gt; u were hitting find u?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nope.  A mob that&#39;s aggressive to you will see you<br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; invisibility (although if you run far enough away<br/>\n&gt; from many<br/>\n&gt; mobs, they will give up chasing you although their<br/>\n&gt; aggressive<br/>\n&gt; radius to you remains enlarged).  In fact, if you<br/>\n&gt; are playing<br/>\n&gt; the invisibility song and any member of your party<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; attacked, you will immediately be attacked because<br/>\n&gt; (1) you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; a bard, and (2) you cast a beneficial &quot;spell&quot; on<br/>\n&gt; someone who<br/>\n&gt; was just attacked so the mob is now aggressive to<br/>\n&gt; you too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because of (1) it&#39;s actually not uncommon for one of<br/>\n&gt; my party<br/>\n&gt; to briefly become visible, the mob(s) charge him,<br/>\n&gt; and the next<br/>\n&gt; pulse they all retarget me because I&#39;m a bard.  What<br/>\n&gt; can I<br/>\n&gt; say, get good armor.  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You really have to watch out for (2) if you&#39;re in a<br/>\n&gt; group with<br/>\n&gt; mixed factions.  If your paladin friend has to kill<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; corrupt guard at the Freeport bank and your song<br/>\n&gt; pulses on him<br/>\n&gt; while he fights, you will lose faction along with<br/>\n&gt; him.  If<br/>\n&gt; your troll buddy gets whacked by the guards and one<br/>\n&gt; of your<br/>\n&gt; songs pulses before he dies, the guards will be<br/>\n&gt; after you<br/>\n&gt; next.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
