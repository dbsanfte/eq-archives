It&#39;s much safer than people make out <br/>\nto be. Folks have one sour experience and they tend to aggrandize their <br/>\ndifficulties, aggravated by the frustration they may have felt at the time. <br/>\nNot that I haven&#39;t had my share of crappy times... ;)<br/>\nIn general I&#39;ve found traveling to be one of the more rewarding things to <br/>\ndo in this game, for me personally. Go for it, my reccomendation is to not <br/>\nstick to zone borders. Get your sense heading up, do a nice big zig-zag <br/>\npattern across new zones, just to make sure you see a good chunk of the <br/>\nlandmarks and inhabitants, have your drum in hand and just... go... ;)<br/>\nGo.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tBob Stewart [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, May 13, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Kelin&#39;s Lament<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:45 AM 5/13/99 -0700, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I used to run back and forth from Freeport to Qeynos all the time (for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;different reasons)...sometimes I&#39;d go to Qeynos and return to Freeport the <br/>\n&gt;same day.

It would be helpful to hear of the<br/>\nadventures of other experienced travellers to help set my own expectations<br/>\nproperly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fears are 1) getting lost, and 2) getting in overwhelming trouble from<br/>\ngetting into an area that&#39;s just too tough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
