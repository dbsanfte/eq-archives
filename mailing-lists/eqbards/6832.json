Ignoring for the moment that there <br/>\nare no traps in the game to disarm, does anyone know how we&#39;re<br/>\nsupposed to disarm traps when we don&#39;t get locate traps?<br/>\nRelying on a rogue to locate the traps for you is pointless<br/>\nsince he&#39;ll be better at disarming them.  And finding traps by<br/>\ntriggering them is also pointless since once they&#39;re triggered<br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to be disarmed (unless of course they&#39;re<br/>\ndesigned to be continuous, which would seem to make locate<br/>\ntraps useless).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been using instll doubt and actually had it work a couple<br/>\ntimes.  Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>\ndoubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>\nstandard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>\npoint of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>\nsaying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill <br/>\nworking).  Huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing around with beg as well.  Apparently you can<br/>\nbeg from monsters and mage pets, but not ships and PCs.  I<br/>\ntried begging from a merchant and a guard in East Commonlands.<br/>\nIn both cases, they immediately killed a wandering monster<br/>\nnearby.  It might&#39;ve been coincidence, but I have to wonder.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen guards kill players for begging from them before, so<br/>\nI was expecting them to attack me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak...  I&#39;ve heard rogues say they use sneak to make<br/>\nmerchants indifferent to them.  I can do the same thing with<br/>\nhide, but haven&#39;t been able to do it with sneak, even when I<br/>\nsneak successfully (move like a glacier).  I&#39;ll have to test<br/>\nit by trying to sneak past some mobs.  I suppose it&#39;s possible<br/>\nthe skill is broken for non-rogues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hit 35 this weekend.  By my timings, 34 with a mistmoore<br/>\ndrum is just short of running twice as fast as normal, 35 with<br/>\na mistmoore drum is just a hair faster than twice as fast. <br/>\nI&#39;m getting quite a few /tells from younger bards and druids<br/>\nand shamen asking how the h*ll I run so fast.  :-)  One<br/>\ndownside is that I&#39;m taking damage again from falls while<br/>\nrunning over rough terrain.  Perhaps we should add to whatever<br/>\npetition is going around to have our cap on safe fall increase<br/>\nby one point per level or so?  Or they could just increase the<br/>\ngravitational constant of the universe so that we stick closer<br/>\nto the ground *snicker*...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
