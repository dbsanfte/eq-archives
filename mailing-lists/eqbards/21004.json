Mind you, EQ doesn&#39;t exactly<br/>\npush the average computer to the limit.  The driver junkies are usually the<br/>\nones trying to squeeze every last fps out of UT and Q3.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with &quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot;... something the Verant Spell<br/>\nteam have yet to learn (he said, bringing things slightly back on topic ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde: apologies if I assume anything I shouldn&#39;t, but did you ensure that<br/>\nthe 5.33 drivers were completely removed before installing 6.18?  Which<br/>\ncard/cpu/mobo combo do you have?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, if you&#39;re only playing EQ, stick to 5.33.  I noticed *zero*<br/>\ndifference with the new drivers. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
