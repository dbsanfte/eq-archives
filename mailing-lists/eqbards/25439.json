I think that they have (stealth<br/>\nnerf) changed this recently.  Only last week, I had first hand<br/>\nexperience<br/>\nwith a 56 warrior who has sta way over 100 and when his sta bar<br/>\ndepleted,<br/>\nyou could see a noticeable slow down in his attack speed (and when he<br/>\ngot a<br/>\nsta replenish buff, you could see it get noticable faster.) Even so, I<br/>\nwould<br/>\nreccommend to ppl starting bards that they max out sta then put the rest<br/>\nin<br/>\ndex or str (forget cha - your cha is prolly fine and easy enough to<br/>\nboost<br/>\nwith jewel craft bracers etc.) Sta adds hps and every little bit helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nVirtuoso<br/>\n&lt;Mercenary Force&gt;<br/>\nSomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercenaryforce.com\">http://www.mercenaryforce.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
