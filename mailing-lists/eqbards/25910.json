The thing for me - I&#39;ve always played<br/>\nPC games since my first computer - and Apple 2+ that I bought in 1981.<br/>\nThere were already console games by that time -and it&#39;s always been clear<br/>\nthat PC games are better in some ways - and consoles better in others. I<br/>\nthink arguing the superiority argument is stupid.  They are different - and<br/>\nsome people prefer one - others like both.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Console ports to PC&#39;s keep that console look-and-feel - and the FF<br/>\ngames especially so.  If you don&#39;t care for that type of game - it&#39;s not<br/>\ngoing to do much for you...<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I play EQ so much - that there&#39;s no point to buy other games.  I<br/>\nhave Civ3 on my hard disk.  Civ 1 and 2 were my favorite games of all time.<br/>\nI stayed up all night playing them.  I&#39;ve never gotten a Civ3 game out of<br/>\nthe medieval era...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: KAZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kazvorpal@...\">kazvorpal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 19, 2002 10:34 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] OT - Final Fantasy X<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; coordination.

Since solving any<br/>\npuzzle is just a matter of time, I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s worth the trouble. I<br/>\nprefer games with a more &quot;organic&quot; feel, which are complex enough to not<br/>\nappear a series of problems, but a sort of abstract set of conditions which<br/>\none must gradually master. Civilization is the best example of this (Alpha<br/>\nCentauri, especially), and even StarCraft (but not the lesser realtime<br/>\nstrategy games), and of course EverQuest. Oh, I loved Star Control 3, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nCoffee contains water...so does your pee<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.IAmKaz.com/\">http://www.IAmKaz.com/</a><br/>\nE-Mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KazVorpal@...\">KazVorpal@...</a><br/>\nAIM/Yahoo/AOL Instant Messenger: KazVorpal<br/>\nICQ#: 1912557<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
