I survived all the LD&#39;s, including the last one.  Unfortunately now<br/>\n&gt;for all I know I may be standing inside the Giant fort in Warsliks<br/>\n&gt;Woods.  I<br/>\n&gt;logged back on far enough to see where my character was and whether he was<br/>\n&gt;naked or not and then gave up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;None of the suggestions in the banner had any effect on the lockups by the<br/>\n&gt;way.  I tried them all.  I wish they would just actually fix the problems<br/>\n&gt;instead of always saying reinstall Directx 7.0a.  I have a friend who has<br/>\n&gt;been plagued with mobs turning into male humans, including the boat!  You<br/>\n&gt;can not ride a boat that is a male human btw.  She is also plagued with<br/>\n&gt;occasional crashes that force a hard reboot as well.  Every call to tech<br/>\n&gt;support has received the same mantric response.  &quot;Delete you character .opt<br/>\n&gt;files.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reinstall Directx 7.0a.  Reinstall your video drivers.&quot;  None of these has<br/>\n&gt;had any effect.  Ever.  She even reformatted her hard drive and reinstalled<br/>\n&gt;everything from scratch, no change.  For the past three months camping a<br/>\n&gt;character causes a crash of EQ to the desktop 75% of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I too experienced these same problems in the same zone, Kit (btw, nice<br/>\n&gt;chatting with you last night).  I&#39;ve only gone LD a total of 3 times before<br/>\n&gt;in the last year of playing.  Last night I went LD twice.  The last time I<br/>\n&gt;went LD, I ended up dying.  It was at this point that I gave up for the<br/>\n&gt;night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gilgurth<br/>\n&gt;Bard of 24 Winces<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kimes, Dean W.

I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;been disconnected more than once on any given night since I got my cable<br/>\n&gt;modem 6 months or so ago.  Last night I was disconnected 12 times.<br/>\n&gt; On about<br/>\n&gt;half those occasions I was disconnected and left at the &quot;You have been<br/>\n&gt;disconnected&quot; screen while EQ locked up the computer forcing a hard reboot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was apparently not alone in my difficulties.  A /who in Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\n&gt;showed 60 characters present, but 23 of them were LinkDead.  I have never<br/>\n&gt;seen so many LinkDead characters in one zone before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did anyone else have troubles?  Was there perhaps some other network issue<br/>\n&gt;at work or was this caused by the patch?  If it wasn&#39;t caused by external<br/>\n&gt;sources and isn&#39;t fixed I guess its back to Asheron&#39;s Call for me, as the<br/>\n&gt;game was totally unplayable last night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Kit<br/>\n&gt;      Somewhere in Warsliks Woods, only wish I knew where<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The servers were down for an emergency patch today.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that<br/>\n&gt;were causing<br/>\n&gt;people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first<br/>\n&gt;time in four<br/>\n&gt;months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>\n&gt;before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4821/10/_/451022/_/959956193/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup<br/>\n&gt;Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.<br/>\n&gt;Install today:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4874/10/_/451022/_/959957311/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4874/10/_/451022/_/959957311/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Buy Long Distance with your GROUP and SAVE!!!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4123/10/_/451022/_/959957851/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4123/10/_/451022/_/959957851/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
