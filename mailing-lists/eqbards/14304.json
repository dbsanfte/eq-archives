The<br/>\n&gt; letter was in a proper tone (i.e. not a whine or rant) to illicit a response<br/>\n&gt; from Verant.  The content of the letter was based off of months of research<br/>\n&gt; and testing by bards on this list and the Concert Hall.  Every issue<br/>\n&gt; discussed in the letter was a legitimate problem that every experienced bard<br/>\n&gt; knew to be true.  This letter had such an impact that GZ decided to devote<br/>\n&gt; an entire Arch Mage answers column to bards. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Yeah, you all stop tooting my horn (so to speak).  Admiral Rokenn and<br/>\n  John(tm) are the single and foremost knowledgable and practical bard<br/>\n  posters on the list as far as raw information goes.  And Kitasi for<br/>\n  his testing of things over and over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anytime someone has a question about bards, I rattle off the EQ Song<br/>\n  Analysis website.  Which I must add, Rokenn has done an excellent job <br/>\n  at maintaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some guy stopped me last week and asked if I was the Harmonic from<br/>\n  eqbards, and the contributer to song analysis.  I told him yeah, and<br/>\n  the guy wanted to get a screenshot of himself next to me...<br/>\n<br/>\n  jeez, I don&#39;t have _that_ big of an ego that needs stroking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pretty weird... I mean I&#39;d take a picture with a friend if we<br/>\n  were at say Old Faithful in Yellowstone, but with a bard in the<br/>\n  EQ game?  It was flattering, but I had to kill more deepwater <br/>\n  goblins.  And plus I was starting to get scared, hehe... stalker!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
