Everyone likes clerics, and<br/>\n  why wouldn&#39;t they?  The fact that you get to stare at a wall all<br/>\n  night doesn&#39;t balance the fact that you are needed so much, I guess<br/>\n  I meant to say.  You have some of the most desired basic traits,<br/>\n  yet you are like an outcast sitting in a corner.  I always try to<br/>\n  make conversation with my cleric under those circumstances.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  got to imagine it&#39;s pretty damn boring.  In hate, there&#39;s like the<br/>\n  &#39;Clerics Corner&#39; where they all sit facing away from battle, it&#39;s<br/>\n  kinda funny, but sad at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tAccording to him he &quot;picked the people he knew would win the<br/>\n&gt; fight&quot;.

It doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>\n  to not utilize the people and evaluate the groupings.
