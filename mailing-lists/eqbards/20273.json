I hate all the<br/>\n&gt; button pushing too, but I dont see how it is worse<br/>\n&gt; than the other melee classes, and the upside is we<br/>\n&gt; dont have to stare at a spell book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got a few characters & while they&#39;re all low levels it&#39;s pretty clear<br/>\nwhat sort of keyboard & mouse skills I&#39;m going to need to play each.  The<br/>\nbiggest difference between the twitching of the bard and that of the other<br/>\nclasses is the focus needed on timing.  For example, a warrior hits taunt or<br/>\nkick or something, waits for the button to pop back up, and hits it again.<br/>\nA bard hits a song, counts to three, hits it again to stop the song,<br/>\nhopefully just as the effect is happening, waits for the songs to un-grey<br/>\nthemselves, and starts the next.  Add in missed notes, resists & the like<br/>\nand we have more we need to pay attention to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I find song juggling far easier than mouse-targeting.  I admire<br/>\nenchanters who use single-mob mezzing effectively.  THAT is a b*&^%.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
