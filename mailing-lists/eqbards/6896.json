All secondary skills should cap somewhere between<br/>\nabove average and just below Master.  I really think our secondary skills<br/>\nshould cap at 100, the last point of &quot;Excellent&quot; before you reach &quot;Master&quot;<br/>\nand halfway to the 200 &quot;double master&quot; that others get as a cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many reasons why #2 should really be addressed that we have all<br/>\ndiscovered throughout the course of our playing since Final release and some<br/>\nhave only become more obvious over time, after other game changes, and as<br/>\nmore players go beyond their skill caps points in level.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n  E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
