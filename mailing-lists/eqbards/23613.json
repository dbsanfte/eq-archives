You as a 35 bard will not be contributing very much to the fight so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-598252741\">A 53 SK and 52 Shaman MIGHT be able to kill the hunter/forager, but it will<br/>\nbe very tough.  You as a 35 bard will not be contributing very much to the<br/>\nfight so it will be up to the two of them.  My regular group when I did the<br/>\nhunter/forager cycle consisted of me at 47, another bard 50th level, 49<br/>\ncleric, 55 warrior and a 50 enchanter.  One of the bards would track and<br/>\npull the hunter/forager.  Once we brought it back to camp, one bard would do<br/>\nnothing but chains/fear the entire fight.  Even though we got chains/fear to<br/>\nstick most of the time, if the cleric had not been there, the warrior<br/>\nprobably would have died since he took a lot of damage in between fearing.<br/>\nYour SK can darkness/fear, but the shaman might not be able to keep the SK<br/>\nhealed up when fear breaks. With the group combo I listed, it would take us<br/>\na couple of minutes to kill the mob.  With your group, it will take even<br/>\nlonger, even if the SK and shaman summon pets.  IMO, you need a couple more<br/>\n45+ folks to do the hunter/forager.  With the extra folks, you would also be<br/>\nable to kill some of the named mobs if they happen to appear.  With just the<br/>\nshaman and SK, you won&#39;t be able to take on any named mob, which are all<br/>\nhigher level than than the hunter/forager.      <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW unless you are extremely lucky, the hunter or forager will not show up<br/>\non track when you zone in.  If thats the case, you will have to run<br/>\nthoughout the zone to find them.  If you get lucky, they will show up on<br/>\ntrack further in the zone.  If you get unlucky, you will have to manually<br/>\nlook for them by left clicking on mobs to target them (there are a ton of<br/>\nfrogloks in the zone so the hunter/forager are easy to miss).  One time my<br/>\ngroup had finished doing the forager cycle so we moved over to start looking<br/>\nfor the hunter so we could complete the key quest.  No one else was in TT<br/>\nhunting them so I knew the hunter was out there somewhere.  I ran around for<br/>\n15 minutes or so and never found him.  No matter where I was at in the zone,<br/>\nthe hunter never appeared on track (no named mobs either).  Suddenly out of<br/>\nthe blue the hunter attacked me.  While taking him back to the group, I hit<br/>\ntrack.  Even though he was right behind me, the hunter still did not show up<br/>\non track.  The reason he didn&#39;t show up on track even though he was right<br/>\nnext to me was because there were 20 other mobs within tracking range who<br/>\nhad spawned after he did.  Bottom line is that it can be a pain in the arse<br/>\nto find the hunter/forager if they don&#39;t immediately show up on track. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris.holden@...\">chris.holden@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris.holden@...\">chris.holden@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2001 6:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Sebilis Keys<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it will be me 35 bard, Shaman 53 and Sk 52 (told you I was helping out<br/>\nhigher levels) so I am not sure how much of a problem it will be for<br/>\nwandering<br/>\nmobs etc. They may bring more people and I get to be the<br/>\nmanabattery/tracker/magic resist buffer. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the info so far everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ranian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n|--------+---------------------------&gt;<br/>\n|        |          &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot;|<br/>\n|        |          &lt;Wendy_Cranfill@m|<br/>\n|        |          axtor.com&gt;       |<br/>\n|        |                           |<br/>\n|        |          01/26/01 10:32 AM|<br/>\n|        |          Please respond to|<br/>\n|        |          eqbards          |<br/>\n|        |                           |<br/>\n|--------+---------------------------&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-|<br/>\n  |<br/>\n|<br/>\n  |       To:     &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n|<br/>\n  |       cc:     (bcc: Chris Holden/Technology/Equifax)<br/>\n|<br/>\n  |       Subject:     RE: [eqbards] Sebilis Keys<br/>\n|<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are, in essence, two &quot;lines&quot; with the hunter and forager and they are,<br/>\nindeed, instant spawns.
