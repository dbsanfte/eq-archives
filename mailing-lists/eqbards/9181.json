Generally the people who do this have<br/>\nsignificantly more down time than I do (mine is nearly zero) so I usually<br/>\njust wander off to somewhere else immediately.  I can then come back a<br/>\nlittle later and voila!, the whole camp is there again and the guy looking<br/>\nfor the choice mob is staring at it and its buddies.  I then lament the<br/>\nothers, kill the choice mob and start to wander off again.  They quickly get<br/>\nthe point generally and ask me to stick around and help them but agree to<br/>\ngive me first choice on any mob that spawns.  The few people I have run into<br/>\nwho don&#39;t have the sense to do this when they otherwise could not &quot;break&quot;<br/>\nthe spawn I usually just leave to their fate and move on.  I imagine this<br/>\nwill get worse though as I go up in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 9:52 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Newbie questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 27 Oct 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n&gt; It will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>\n&gt; you just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.
