This is one Shxxty zone.  I really dont like it either. Some<br/>\nof the worst pathing and agro problems here as in any zone I have been in,<br/>\ncurrently.

Gore dropped a set last time we<br/>\nkilled her also. I even saw someone auctioning a set in DL a couple days<br/>\nago. Wish I could recall the name for you. Sebasttian even offered me his<br/>\nwalrus drum when he got the Selos drums from Gore, not realizing I already<br/>\nhad Selo&#39;s drums and didn&#39;t lotto on purpose. You&#39;ll get drums, don&#39;t sweat<br/>\nit!<br/>\nAs to keeping vox from Ch&#39;ing, our theory is to have all the tanks on the<br/>\nsame side to cause her to move. The moving is supposed to interrupt her<br/>\nspells. We&#39;ve been susccessful with this the couple times I was along.<br/>\nI have heard the spawned Trak is the same as the Real Trak in drops and<br/>\npower, but I have not fought him personally.<br/>\nAS for epic, I am more concerned now with the lycanthrope skull and phin&#39;s<br/>\nbackbone. Is the warlord in Karnor&#39;s the only mob that drops the skull? How<br/>\nrare a drop is it? I really hate Karnor&#39;s and have put this off too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
