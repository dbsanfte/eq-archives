I would not be surprised if someone could level from 1 to 50 with<br/>\nout ever leaving this zone. :)   And for the mid levels teens to high 20&#39;s I<br/>\ndo not think there is a better zone in the game.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTo find mobs that will be tasty in the low to mid teens you need to go the<br/>\nNE shore of the lake.  Going NE from here is a wide valley that leads to<br/>\nCabilis.  As you get closer to Cabilis the mob levels drop, till you get to<br/>\nthe guards then they get high real fast ;)  There is a nice camp in the<br/>\nvalley of Forsaken Iksar that would be perfect for your level range (loc<br/>\n3250, -1800).

So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a <br/>\n&gt; wide turn <br/>\n&gt; &gt; back while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I <br/>\n&gt; deposited the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; extra mob back where we were originally fighting and we <br/>\n&gt; finished him <br/>\n&gt; &gt; off.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Heal Kiting&quot; rocks :o) I used it all the time on the south <br/>\n&gt; shore of Eask<br/>\n&gt; karana against Gnoll Reavers. Without SoW it goes like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Selos, autorun<br/>\n&gt; Arm drum to get distance<br/>\n&gt; switch to lute<br/>\n&gt; alternate selos and hymn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; keep them close enough to keep chasing you, I *think* their <br/>\n&gt; healing rate is<br/>\n&gt; the combat one when chasing not the faster non-combat rate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tsengu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; WIN A TRIP TO SPACE OR $50,000!
