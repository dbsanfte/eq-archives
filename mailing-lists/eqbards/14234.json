I am a half-elf bard on E&#39;ci who started in Qeynos and spent<br/>\nthe first 8 levels between Quenos and Blackburrow, a lot of time in<br/>\nBlackBurrow.  Not only do these pictures bring back bittersweet memories of<br/>\nmy younger years, I remember when Lullabye was useful too.  I also remember<br/>\nwhen they changed it so that it would only affect at most 4 mobs instead of<br/>\nas many as were in the song radius.  Ahhh the good old days.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 03, 2000 10:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] How Lullaby used to be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I was roaming around the net and I found these old pictures Sylly<br/>\n&gt;   took.

Full bronze which I worked<br/>\n&gt;   my ass of for from the first wave of L50s on Innoruuk.  This is<br/>\n&gt;   when a bronze bp would run about 75-100pp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I put over 20 gnolls to sleep, ranging from scrawny to elite.<br/>\n&gt;   I lost maybe 2 or 3 bubbles of health for the 2 or 3 mins I stood<br/>\n&gt;   there holding them still.  That&#39;s right, completely still.  Hardly<br/>\n&gt;   anything attacked me, they stayed asleep until I stopped playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   This is how it used to be.  Verant (and GZ) blatantly lied that<br/>\n&gt;   they haven&#39;t adjusted this song since release.  I tried to sleep<br/>\n&gt;   off a few skeletons yesterday and I could not keep the group <br/>\n&gt;   controlled at all.  The programmers didn&#39;t just put in the failed<br/>\n&gt;   to mesmerize message, about 4 or 5 months ago they definitely F&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;   this song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
