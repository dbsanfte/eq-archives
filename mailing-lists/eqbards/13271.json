I got thru level 20 buy hunting in Highhold<br/>\nKeep.  I would get my name on the Main Room List and<br/>\nthen go to the gnoll side of Highhold Pass and solo<br/>\nthe various spawns there until my name came up.  I<br/>\nwent from 1/4 bubble into 20 to a sliver left to level<br/>\nlast Sunday. Only one death in that time due to a<br/>\ncouple of our casters deciding to duel between spawns<br/>\nand were therefore low on mana when a guard spawned. <br/>\nI got level 21 the next night after about 4 kills.  So<br/>\nlevel 20 was relatively painless for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go someplace that isn&#39;t camped (at<br/>\nleast on Mithaniel Marr) then pick up one other person<br/>\nnear your level and go to the Undead Isle.  This is<br/>\nthe first island to the right when facing the ocean<br/>\nfrom the dock at the Sister&#39;s Isle.  You can recognize<br/>\nit because it is barren rock.  You have to kill the<br/>\nGreater Skeletons to get the Gargoyles to spawn.  The<br/>\nGargoyles will range in level from low blues to<br/>\nyellows for a level 20 character.  With 2 people you<br/>\nshould be able to pick up about 1/2 a bubble an hour<br/>\nwith no deaths.  There are 4 spectres at the very top<br/>\nof the island.  Aggro those and don&#39;t even bother to<br/>\nrun because your dead, but this will never happen with<br/>\na little bit of caution.  As an additional benefit the<br/>\nGargoyles drop eyes that you can sell at the Sister<br/>\nIsle for 9.5 pp each with &quot;Kindly&quot; faction.  My<br/>\nhunting partner and I made 45pp in about 2 hours there<br/>\nthis past weekend.  Also the Gargoyle death animation<br/>\nis one of the best I&#39;ve seen so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin,<br/>\nBard of the 21st Song,<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Donny Dane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane@...\">ddane@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got my bard to 20th level...<br/>\n&gt; I played 20th level for about 6 weeks ( a couple of<br/>\n&gt; hours a night).  Every<br/>\n&gt; death cost me about a week of play time.<br/>\n&gt; One group I was in, let me die 3 times, with no one<br/>\n&gt; else near death (2<br/>\n&gt; clerics!), so i bailed.  I&#39;ve nearly lost 20th, now,<br/>\n&gt; and have pretty much retired my bard.  (Who ever<br/>\n&gt; said 20 wasn&#39;t a hell<br/>\n&gt; level???).  I&#39;m playing my DE Enchanter now (up to<br/>\n&gt; 9th level)<br/>\n&gt; Leveling the enchanter is much easier than it was<br/>\n&gt; with the bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would LOVE to continue playing my bard, but I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t figure out how to get<br/>\n&gt; experience, and keep it, especially in pick-up<br/>\n&gt; groups.  Unfortunately, most<br/>\n&gt; of my guild has surpassed me in levels, and I no<br/>\n&gt; longer get xp if I group<br/>\n&gt; with them.  I would love to power-level up to around<br/>\n&gt; 25 or so, and join my<br/>\n&gt; guildmates, but I have been unable to find anyplace<br/>\n&gt; that is not camped to<br/>\n&gt; the hilt on Solusek Ro.  The aviaks are consistently<br/>\n&gt; camped, both in South<br/>\n&gt; Karana and Lake Rathe.  Solusek A is a death trap. <br/>\n&gt; Likewise, with Unrest<br/>\n&gt; and the Cauldron.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone out there has some novel ideas on how to<br/>\n&gt; find stuff to solo power<br/>\n&gt; level with, I would love to hear it.   But, for now,<br/>\n&gt; MacGrough is retired<br/>\n&gt; (sitting in ButcherBlock after 2 deaths in<br/>\n&gt; Cauldron).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt; 20th Song Bard - Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n&gt; Aazure<br/>\n&gt; 9th Spell Enchanter - Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: G.W.

Its<br/>\n&gt; difficult to find a good group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; during this time because this is also the weed out<br/>\n&gt; period - worse that<br/>\n&gt; hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that<br/>\n&gt; class in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At anyrate, your position is clear (push past<br/>\n&gt; these levels as quickly as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possible) and while boring, doing the noterious<br/>\n&gt; deepwater goblin pets of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lake Rathetear will get you though it, and will<br/>\n&gt; get you out of your rut.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2<br/>\n&gt; pets still run by every 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mins.  As someone here stated before [referring to<br/>\n&gt; hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the<br/>\n&gt; ogres on the hill if<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in<br/>\n&gt; a group and go to work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You have a convient zone line if something goes<br/>\n&gt; wrong and a food and water<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vendor literally next door.  You can kill the<br/>\n&gt; bandits on the other side of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the gut handily for lunch money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Trust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in<br/>\n&gt; about a week with modest<br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; songs, powered by your new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher levels, will be more effective and desired<br/>\n&gt; in a group (for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; record, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have<br/>\n&gt; mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; pay me to forget the<br/>\n&gt; song.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just like insurance, ya hope you never have to use<br/>\n&gt; it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home without it.).  I suppose there is an argument<br/>\n&gt; to go through these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels the traditional way, but I did that the<br/>\n&gt; first time around -- it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; painful and in the end the only valuable<br/>\n&gt; lesson/tactic/govering principle<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that<br/>\n&gt; again!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have fun and good luck,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -GW<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project<br/>\n&gt; gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         You can even make money by referring<br/>\n&gt; friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a><br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
