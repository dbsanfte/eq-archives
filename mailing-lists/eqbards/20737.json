We have a druid guildmate who refuses to SoW or bind<br/>\nanyone who does not give him libations first.  He claims that without the<br/>\nproper offering of wine,  the gods may not favor his spell.  If they<br/>\ncontinue to whine, he says ok I&#39;ll try and then casts a damage spell on<br/>\nthem.  When they get the &quot;protected&quot; message, he sighs and tells them that<br/>\nthe gods will not let him give them the spell without the proper libations<br/>\nfirst.  I&#39;ve seen several people walk away convinced that this was indeed<br/>\nthe case and return later with new-bought alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 27, 2000 9:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] new guild and new server?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I love this and plan to steal the idea for my own<br/>\n&gt; shaman!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I enjoy this...but the reactions you get are often<br/>\nless than appreciative:<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior: SOW me please<br/>\nFenryr: &quot;Thows a handful of bones on the ground and<br/>\nstudies them carefully&quot; -- Spirits say give elven wine<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\nWarrior: I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nFenryr: Then you must qet some.
