For instrument songs<br/>\nthe bonus would increase what you could do without an instrument but<br/>\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t equal what you could do with one.  For other songs it<br/>\nwould just give a way to help those out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m with you right up til the end.  that would be totally unbalancing to<br/>\nhave an<br/>\ninstrument double the effect.  actually on further thought it would be<br/>\npretty <br/>\nunbalancing period.  can you imagine singing 3 chants with the drum effect<br/>\nand being able to dual wield yaks?  plus you&#39;d be able to mix instrument<br/>\nsong<br/>\ntypes and get the maximum usage out of the songs without having to switch<br/>\ninstruments and at the same time have the bonus of using weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
