Just Chain &#39;em, then Screech, rinse, and repeat.  Also,<br/>\nif you pull more than one MOB, make *sure* you get the Chain to stick, then<br/>\nhit Screech, and watch the other critters run off, leaving you alone with<br/>\nyour victim (and with the way things aggro in Ill Omen, if you fear the<br/>\ngroup off, then move backwards a few yards, that should effectively put you<br/>\nout of the rest of the groups&#39; aggro range so you can kill them one by<br/>\none... oh yeah, when healing, don&#39;t sit down unless you want them to &#39;port<br/>\nright on top of you).  Keep in mind, this is not an exact science, as<br/>\nsometimes the whole group, or portions may come back, but if you do it<br/>\nenough, it will work most of the time.<br/>\n    Also, Screech is AE, so be careful that you don;t get any other MOBs<br/>\ncaught in it (learned that lil lesson while fighting Icy Orcs in Perma...<br/>\ndamn that Iceberg :oP )<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n31<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, May 10, 2000 11:32 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Our two main weapons...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech...
