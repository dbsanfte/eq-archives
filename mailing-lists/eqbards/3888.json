","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1078062058\">Well, having recently made 15 (and now 16 and 17 - all in 2 weekends) I got<br/>\nexcited about the Lullby - as someone had been telling me - was it you<br/>\nHarmonic?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways - I tried it out and had some good success with it.  But my<br/>\nenchanter friend keeps telling me she will be the crowd control expert and<br/>\nmy sleepy song is not reliable (she heard that the mobs have a chance to<br/>\nresist it - and to her that means break out and attack).  So there we were<br/>\nrunning the river from East Karanas on our way to South Karanas and as we<br/>\npass the raider camp (all green and a couple blue cons), I go can we try out<br/>\nmy sleepy song.  So, eveyone - me 16, enchanter 18, ranger 17, & druid 18<br/>\nagree to give it a go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my way running back from Highhold with the ranger who used to be my<br/>\nfriend but now wont even talk to me, I had a chance to asses what went<br/>\nwrong....<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, - them green and blues - were lots of them.  And bunches of them<br/>\nwere casters.  So to answer your question - what is worst is a swarm of<br/>\ngreen casters!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - I fired up the song and played my lute but the mistake was running<br/>\ndown to them to start the attack.  I should have attacked the edges and<br/>\npulled on one - then if the whole camp jumped me at least they would be<br/>\nclose and under the spell.  As it was - I attacked then got them mad and<br/>\ncasting without getting close enough to put them all to sleep.  Only a<br/>\ncouple came over to fight - the rest just stood off and casted on us and<br/>\nbuffed their buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I died and the ranger died but the enchanter and druid survived and<br/>\nfinished off the rest of the raiders. Grrrr,  now I have to go back and get<br/>\nsome revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on I did get to show my enchanter friend how it really does work.  We<br/>\nwere down in SK working on aviaks and got an unexpected double or triple<br/>\npull.  This time I did manage to hold them quite well and the party was<br/>\nsmart enough to fight only one at a time.  So I think I was able to build<br/>\nsome respect for the Lucid Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some major differences between how an enchanter can do it and how<br/>\nand when we use it.  The enchanter can target and mez just one - ours is AE<br/>\nand you need to be aware of the ramifications of that.  Also, the enchanter<br/>\ncan mez then memblur.  We do this a lot when a pesky green joins a melee.<br/>\nMez it and kill off the big mob. Then blur it and walk away.  It goes on its<br/>\nmerry totally forgotten how much it hated us.  If we put something to sleep<br/>\n- we go to number one on their hate parade when they wake up.  That can be<br/>\nused to your advantage though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mob decides to lock on to your caster, and you can&#39;t taunt it off<br/>\nwith attack or bellow, you can try the lucid lullaby.  If you can make it<br/>\nnod - it forgets about that nasty old caster and turns back on you - it<br/>\nhelps if the caster will stop stabbin it while you nod it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d really like to hear some more tips about using this and other bard<br/>\nfighting skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 15th   no 16 no 17th level!<br/>\na.k.a.
