Like I said, I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; something about the mouse acceleration freaking out when one<br/>\n&gt; &quot;instant&quot; the mouse is here, and the next &quot;instant&quot; (after the<br/>\n&gt; hard drive and CPU have done the data transfer) the mouse is<br/>\n&gt; all the way over there.  I don&#39;t have the problem when I turn<br/>\n&gt; with the keyboard, but the turn rate doing that is much lower.<br/>\n&gt; The problem is much less pronounced in glide mode.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
