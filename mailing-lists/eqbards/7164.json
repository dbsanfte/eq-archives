Killed this, killed that, got<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; got that, had goofy fun with a small group of folks. Which is all fine,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; not very creative sounding. Then on the very same day friends from Siege<br/>\n&gt; Perilous start sending me emails out of the blue...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For all the thrill of EQ hunting, visuals, for all the total rockingness<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the Bard class...I am left feeling like I am not creating what I want to<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; creating in an online world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In UO I raised huge armies (more than anyone else actually) got whole<br/>\nshards<br/>\n&gt; in an uproar, wrote a lot of story, all without one bit of help from OSI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And now once again I am off to Siege Perilous, where have gathered some of<br/>\n&gt; the best story people from all the shards. The Imperium, The Sinful, the<br/>\n&gt; Temple of Monadain, Shadowclan orcs, the Mordain sisters and more. I go<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; to revive Tengu the Summoner, but to reinvent him. (Heeee! I just HAD to<br/>\nsay<br/>\n&gt; that *laughs*).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back to the old stinky interface the old stinky spawn, the old stinky<br/>\ncombat<br/>\n&gt; system...all those I can live with, but I can&#39;t live without large scale<br/>\n&gt; creative community. And all the biggies of large scale creative community<br/>\n&gt; are on SP. So off I go. It&#39;s been a total blast, I will miss the Bard<br/>\nclass<br/>\n&gt; most of all...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep your lutes dry and your blade polished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin a.k.a Tengu<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
