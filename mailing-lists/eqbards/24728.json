If I use MOB A to finish the fight, I get half exp (As<br/>\n&gt;far as I know -- I believe this to be true.). If I let charm drop and<br/>\n&gt;kill MOB B, MOB B will disappear and I will get NO exp. Why is this?<br/>\n&gt;Simple, 1500 HP of damage is assigned to a MOB (remember the guards<br/>\n&gt;in the newbie areas?) If you are outdamaged by a MOB, say bye, bye to<br/>\n&gt;the exp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gaelthorne,<br/>\n&gt;Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aren&#39;t you supposed to charm your victim before you kill it to clear it&#39;s <br/>\nexp history list?
