","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1338599329\">Hail Roop and bards!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was an excellent list indeed. I&#39;m compiling a smilar list for the<br/>\nSoerbaird and love to hear what other bards have done with songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question I pose to all you bards out there: The Charismatic Carillon--<br/>\nI know a few of you have posted that you use this song, and that it has at<br/>\nleast a minimal affect, but I have not even seen that much. My thinking is<br/>\nthat the song has not yet been giving the blessing of the gods (it is bugged).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, could some one advise me of the appropriate way to use this song? Do<br/>\nI murmur it to myself, or do I serenade the shopkeeper with whom I wish to<br/>\ndo business? Do I initiate the trade immediately after I sing, or do I wait<br/>\na moment? How long do I have?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would advocate that this song is more effective than it currently is, for<br/>\nat the moment it seems to be making no difference in my buying. Of course,<br/>\nI am a VERY charming fellow already, and maybe I have found a limit to the<br/>\namount dashing good looks can affect purchasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen and Live!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
