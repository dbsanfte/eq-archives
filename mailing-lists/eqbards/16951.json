The mobs are running away and other people only get added to the<br/>\nhate lists if they attempt to attack.  Once the offending parties zone the<br/>\nmobs will continue to run until fear wears off and then will mosey on back<br/>\nto their spawn spots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really can&#39;t see how using dirge to clear the path for evac is useful:<br/>\nIn the same 3 seconds you could either hit 4 mobs and yourself for 300-odd<br/>\ndamage or clear away a good 90% of the mobs for the duration of the evac.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
