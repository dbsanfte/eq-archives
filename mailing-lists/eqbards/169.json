It is a good place to relax and<br/>\nincrease ones skill in swimming, I went from a 2 to a 18 in about 10<br/>\nminutes. Anyway, as I was swimming I heard a desperate 4th level wizard<br/>\nasking for help in finding his body. I felt I would help.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI met him at the west gate, and spoke which him. He had been ambushed by a<br/>\nKodak bear in the west commons. the attack had left him with nothing but his<br/>\nspells. He asked for some food and help in finding his body. I gave some<br/>\niron rations and water. I was low my self, but I gave him what I could. the<br/>\nrun would be quick. I then used my Acceleration song and grouped with him so<br/>\nwe could run there faster and be able to outrun any danger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlas upon Reaching the divide at the edge of the west commons disaster hit.<br/>\nMy link to the server crashed. And I could not get back on. I tried for half<br/>\nan hour! and nothing. I fear he was left in the western commons without<br/>\nweapon, armor, or food other than the meager rations I gave. My heart sunk<br/>\ninto my boots...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI am sick over leaving him to fend for his self. I wish I knew what<br/>\nhappened to him. Did he try and succeed in finding his body?  Did he return<br/>\nto the city and look for me? Or find another that could help him? Please if<br/>\nanyone meets a 4th level wizard in the city of Freeport named Ceen, or hear<br/>\ntell of him, Please let me know if he is OK. Or if possible, if you meet him<br/>\nplease tell him how sorry I am for being forced out of the realm, and that I<br/>\nwish to make it up to him in some way. I am truly heart sick for losing my<br/>\nward, and feel very melancholy over abandoning him like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlas I now fear helping others, for having the same happen to them. for I<br/>\nhave no way of telling him it was unavoidable. So please, if anyone can,<br/>\nrelay my message...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- SnowLynx, [Most sad] gentleman bard of Freeport...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
