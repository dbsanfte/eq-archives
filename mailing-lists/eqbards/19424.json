The reward for the Test of Steel on the Rathe was posted to EQlizer.<br/>\nIts pretty awesome.  I doubt anyone below level 50 could win any of these<br/>\nevents anyhow.  Every event I&#39;ve been to has been completely dominated by<br/>\ncharacters over level 40 regardless of the inappropriate nature of their<br/>\nlevel with respect to the event.  As a result the npc&#39;s were given powers of<br/>\ninstant death and invulnerability.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey need to create a level flag for zones that prevents people over a<br/>\ncertain level from entering while an event is happening so that they could<br/>\nactually hold events for people under 50th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/empower_ring.html\">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/empower_ring.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 9:17 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Test of ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does appear that once again, Bards have been left out.
