Last night, for a change of pace, I<br/>\ndecided I&#39;d play my Gnome Enchanter and make some coin.  I logged in,<br/>\ndiscovered I was right next Butcherblock entrance of Greater Faydark.  And<br/>\nthere were people hollering for binds.  Oh joy!  So I ran as fast as my<br/>\nstubby little legs would carry me, only to discover they&#39;d already gotten<br/>\nbinds.  No biggy.  I set up camp, medded in preparation, memorized the<br/>\nnecessary spells only to have someone plop down next to me and shout &quot;Free<br/>\nbinds, next 5 minutes!&quot; *mutter* okay, so I waited.  5 minutes later, he<br/>\nleft, and I auctioned &quot;Binding for donations in Kelethin area&quot; (figuring, I<br/>\ncould get to either &quot;major&quot; bind point in a brief period.)  for the next 2<br/>\nhours I auctioned.  Not one taker.<br/>\nSome days I should just stay in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point was not how depressing that was.  The point is that tonight,<br/>\nI&#39;m going back, gonna play someone else or somewhere else, and I will have<br/>\nfun.  And if not, well, EQ can sleep while I do other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n(BTW, While I was there some guy auctioned 2 Combine Long Swords for 15<br/>\nplat. ACK! I asked him twice but apparently he&#39;d already been besieged :P<br/>\nOh well.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
