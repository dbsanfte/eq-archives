We get called that by other<br/>\nguilds alot more than we refer to ourselves as that :P.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think Innoruuk has it good.  The top 6 or 7 guilds are close<br/>\nenough that alot of stuff is done by consensus and we don&#39;t have anyone<br/>\ndoing any of the things that FoH is accused of doing on a consistent<br/>\nbasis.  Sure, every guild (OBS and LoD included) tries to pull a stunt now<br/>\nand then, but no one really cares in the long run, cause no one really has<br/>\na monopoly on anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
