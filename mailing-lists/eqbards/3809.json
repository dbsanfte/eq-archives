I have<br/>\nbags/boxes in my other four slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes it very easy to switch instruments/weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering, is there any trick to keeping those inventory slots open<br/>\n(i.e. free of random loot) without manually having to put every item into<br/>\na bag? I bought a mandolin and horn to fill 2 more slots, but there&#39;s<br/>\nstill 1 empty slot (which needs to stay empty, so when I swap out 1<br/>\ninstrument, there&#39;s room for a shield + weapon). Anytime I look anything<br/>\nit gets automatically dropped into that slot, which is very annoying when<br/>\ntrying to switch weapons later.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully there&#39;s some good tips out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, =)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
