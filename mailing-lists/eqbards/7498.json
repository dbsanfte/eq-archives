For those people who have made up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-123827924\">I think one of the reasons a lot of us are sick of arguing this <br/>\npoint - it&#39;s a &quot;hot-button&quot; topic similar IRL to abortion...  For those <br/>\npeople who have made up their mind and have strong feelings on this <br/>\nissue there is little anyone is going to say that will change their <br/>\nbeliefs one iota.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I personally don&#39;t have strong personal opinions one way or another; <br/>\nexcept that I&#39;m convinced that Verant&#39;s position is very hard and they <br/>\nwon&#39;t budge on this.  JM Caprozzi (sp?), wrote about this.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nclear exactly how good of a source he was on this; but I expect pretty <br/>\ngood; talked about the internal debate at Verant .  According to this <br/>\ninfo; this was one of the most contentious issues on the design team.  <br/>\nMany were against expanding the binding to the point where it&#39;s at now.<br/>\n<br/>\n    One of the issues I recall he listed for bards (and some of the <br/>\nother classes that don&#39;t have bind) not getting it - was the idea that <br/>\nsince we don&#39;t have to regenerate mana for our primary fighting ability <br/>\n- we don&#39;t have the potential down-time between combat and <br/>\nhypothetically can fight continuously.  The caster types with bind could <br/>\nnever do this; hence the need for a balancing factor.  [DON&#39;T ARGUE THIS <br/>\nPOINT WITH ME - THIS IS NOT MY BELIEF]<br/>\n<br/>\n    So bottom-line; what value are petitions here?  I think they are <br/>\nuseful on issues where Verant doesn&#39;t have a strong opinion, or is <br/>\nwavering; but I doubt that Verant will change their philosophy of how <br/>\nthey think the game should work based on a petition.  The only thing <br/>\nthat I could see that would cause them to change their core design <br/>\nphilosophy if the number of subscribers and hence cash-flow dropped a <br/>\nsignificant amount - with letters, etc saying that the binding issue was <br/>\nwhat led the player to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This IMHO is why Ultima Online is adding non-PVP zones.  I <br/>\npersonally know of at least a half-zone (or more) people including <br/>\nmyself who left UOL because of PVP issues.   Money speaks.  But I doubt <br/>\nthat this is a deciding issue for whether people will continue to pay <br/>\n$10/hour for EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n        What would be really nice for Verant; despite their desire to <br/>\nkeep the game mechanics hidden -  would be to have a chat session; or <br/>\nsimply posted a document discussing their high-level philosophy of the <br/>\ngame.  The Designer Dragon guy at Origin was great about this when the <br/>\nPVP debate raged on.  I believe EQ proved him wrong (i.e. he said NO ONE <br/>\nwould play on PVP servers if non-PVP was available).<br/>\n<br/>\n    As far as future discussions of Bardic Binding; Personally I would <br/>\nlove it if all classes could be bound anywhere.  I don&#39;t think bards <br/>\nshould have the ability to bind themselves.  But more importantly; I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think Verant will ever change their position on it.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nenough people will quit the game over it to FORCE them to change.  I <br/>\nthink any further discussion is a waste of breath (not that people&#39;s <br/>\nopinions are worthwhile or valid, it&#39;s simply a waste of time because we <br/>\naren&#39;t going to convince Verant).  I&#39;m certainly not going to quit the <br/>\ngame over it; and no one will be able to convince me to do so (at least <br/>\nnot over this issue...)<br/>\n<br/>\n    To be true to my word - this is the last time I will post on this <br/>\nissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde, 23 (almost 24!) of Xegony<br/>\nOrder of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
