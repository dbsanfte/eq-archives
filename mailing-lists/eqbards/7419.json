Once our charm wears off,<br/>\nthe pet has no master to return to, and suicides.  Since our charm duration<br/>\nis so short, there&#39;s not really a need to bother with invisibility.  Fear<br/>\nwill also work.  I hear rooting, then moving a certain distance away also<br/>\nworks.<br/>\nNot sure about charming the owner of the pet, but I believe the pet still<br/>\nattacks you.  Frankly, the pets I encounter do so little damage, I&#39;ve never<br/>\nreally payed attention to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 44 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 4:44 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Charm song and pets (was More stealth nerfing)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I get some clarification on how the charm song now works against pets.<br/>\nBased on how I interpret this thread, you can&#39;t charm a pet while the<br/>\ncaster/owner is still alive.  However, once the owner dies, you can now<br/>\ncharm the pet. When you charm the pet, if you want to get rid of him fast,<br/>\nyou can then sing the invis song and the pet will destroy himself.  Is this<br/>\ncorrect?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you charm the owner of a pet, will the pet start attacking the mobs<br/>\nyou are fighting or will he continue to attack your party? <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of e&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I can verify that this is true.  I&#39;ve been fighting a lot in Solusek B<br/>\n&gt; lately, and regularily charm pets so that we don&#39;t have to bother killing<br/>\n&gt; them.  When the master is still alive, you are greeted with the message<br/>\n&gt; &quot;That NPC cannot be charmed&quot;.  Once the master is dead, no problem.<br/>\n&gt; Another thing to note, the pet often won&#39;t suicide if there are other MOBS<br/>\n&gt; around, even if they&#39;re not the master.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not too bad if true.  in my groups those pets are just pesky and<br/>\n&gt; usually ignored til the owner is dead anyway, so we can just charm him at<br/>\n&gt; the end of the fight and avoid the pain of having to kill it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; eq.castersrealm.com says you can charm pets after the owner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been killed.  Still not perfect, but better than not being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to charm at all.  Apparently this is aimed at PvP, where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magicians were being annoyed by bards and enchanters charming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (and instakilling with invisibility) their pets.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
