A combination of lament, charm<br/>\nand other level 50 bard capabilities allow them to do rather well against<br/>\nsub-35 mobs. The amount of time it took for her to get the darn firewalker<br/>\nboots to finally drop.  At level 38, with my brothers level 35 druid, I was<br/>\nable to hold the King and the Torturer for hours and yes, I was getting XP<br/>\nfor most of the spawns in there.  Throw in my wifes level 36 warrior at the<br/>\ntime and there was no danger to us at all... at least until I got greedy and<br/>\nwent for the high shaman too.  Talk about a train from hell.  Thank god<br/>\ndruids get evac!  What a combo, evac and fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
