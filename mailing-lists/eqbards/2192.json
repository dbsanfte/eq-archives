I picked two trees and ran between<br/>\nthem four times under different effects, measuring the time<br/>\nwith a stopwatch:<br/>\n<br/>\nNo speed enhancement :  12.1 12.1 12.1 12.1<br/>\nSoW : 8.7 8.7 8.7 8.7<br/>\nSelo&#39;s, no drum : 8.7 8.9 8.9 8.8<br/>\nSelo&#39;s, with drum : 7.4 7.4 7.4 7.4<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a L20 SoW is barely faster than a L21 Selo&#39;s without a<br/>\ndrum, but Selo&#39;s blows it away with a drum.  Selo&#39;s is also<br/>\ngetting close to twice the speed of just plain walking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to time Selo&#39;s with a drum while running backwards.<br/>\n:-)  From the times I&#39;ve done it to druids and shamen, I&#39;d say<br/>\nSelo&#39;s running backwards with a drum is pretty close to Selo&#39;s<br/>\nrunning forward without a drum.  SoW is faster, but barely.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
