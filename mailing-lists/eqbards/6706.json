They were<br/>\ndefinitely separate items and did not stack with one another (much like the<br/>\nold berries and fruit that have been around and have the same graphic).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other bards on this list found any of the unique new forage items yet<br/>\ntoo?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - my forage is maxed at the cap, 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  New!!
