It isn&#39;t the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s the EFFECT that the song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this *effect* that carries over into the next song.  If the next song is a toe-tapper, the audience may still feel a little sad for a while even as they start tapping.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStargazer, Erudite Enchanter - Fennin Ro (and frustrated bard)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nwhat is the roleplaying\r<br/>\naspect of it.  personally i sing one song, because in reality i can\r<br/>\nonly sing one song.  if roleplaying doesn&#39;t matter to you fine, but\r<br/>\nthis is just an observation for all you rpers like me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
