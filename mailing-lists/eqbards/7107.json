It was my first post to the list and I<br/>\nthought I had a legitimate issue and was very happy to read the varied opinions<br/>\nfrom the list members. Some of the opinions and play styles differ from mine.<br/>\nThat&#39;s cool. I can understand their motivations and now I am better for it.<br/>\nMaybe my future party members may be better for it as well. That doesn&#39;t sound<br/>\nmuch like a troll to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to lurk mode where nobody knows your name.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n* SNIP *<br/>\n<br/>\nHey! Don&#39;t do that!  I started this thread, but I&#39;m not the guy that said troll<br/>\n(tho I believe he was just making a joke).  This has been a great discussion,<br/>\nand without you it would have been much less fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are willing to reason, and never resort to cheap shots.  And as a huge<br/>\nbonus, you can admit when you may have made an error!  Wow, talk about a bonus<br/>\non any discussion list.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
