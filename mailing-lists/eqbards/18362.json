Not looking for a name or  specific <br/>\n&gt;location , but in my search ( solo ) , this would help a lot.    There is a <br/>\n&gt;kind of zone divider on one side is frogs and mantraps and other such stuff , <br/>\n&gt;and then there is that gate , and the spectral / treasure hunter side . could <br/>\n&gt;you possibly say which side its on , in either case there is still a ton on <br/>\n&gt;either side. but it would really help.  I wanna find this sucker on my own , <br/>\n&gt;but its getting old hehe. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you don&#39;t want to answer this on the list you can email me privately at <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevikazzam@...\">kevikazzam@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think it gives away too much , and would be a great help to me <br/>\n&gt;In anycase thanks for your time. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ulaien Firesong <br/>\n&gt;lvl 51 bard of Trakanon .....errr....Tunare :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
