Rangers don&#39;t get plate, but they get double attack, archery and<br/>\n&gt;kick.   And so on and so on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards wearing plate is, I think, a good thing.  I&#39;m not sure if the mob AI <br/>\n&gt;is working as intended, or not.  I know in P4, if I so much as hummed a <br/>\n&gt;ditty under my breath in Greater Faydark, I would have, what seemed like, <br/>\n&gt;every orc in the zone on my tail.  It seems this as been toned down some.  <br/>\n&gt;Or maybe, since they are all green to me now, they steer clear of me when I <br/>\n&gt;do make the occassional visit home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From a different perspective, there was a discussion on the druid board not <br/>\nlong ago about druids wearing plate.  At higher levels, if a druid heals a <br/>\nparty member, this results in the druid pulling at least one mob off the <br/>\ntank (sometimes all, this has happened to my druid).  Druids cannot wear <br/>\nplate, their AC is a joke. They aren&#39;t tanks, but druids are supposed to be <br/>\nable to melee some. Yet, their spells will draw the monsters onto them in <br/>\nsplit second.  Clerics wear plate just for this reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt very well may be this is why Verant decided to allow bards to wear plate. <br/>\nBecause they knew a bard&#39;s songs would instantly put him at the top of the <br/>\nhate list.  If the monster AI, is in fact, working as Verant intended it to, <br/>\nfillet of bard is a then considered a mob delicacy, and we should have the <br/>\nplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the great thing about EQ, is that we are all free to decide how <br/>\nwe want to roleplay our characters, and there is no rule that says anyone <br/>\nhas to wear plate if they don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
