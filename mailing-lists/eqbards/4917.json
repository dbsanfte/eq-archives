This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone except for<br/>\nCazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>\nkilled all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>\ninteresting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore them. At this<br/>\npoint we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us and if another<br/>\nserver could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we launched our assault<br/>\nand imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better come over and<br/>\nhelp him. At this point various profanties where uttered as we realized our<br/>\nfatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread showed up on the<br/>\nspot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had several high<br/>\nlevel magicancs and necros which set their pets on the henchmen. With this<br/>\nborrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal losses. Killing<br/>\nhim was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>\nDefinatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>\n<br/>\nUpdated bestiary: <br/>\nPhoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to TWO random<br/>\nclass specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these guys and TWO<br/>\ndropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff. <br/>\nCazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him was so much fun<br/>\ncause that was a big let down. <br/>\nNightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>\nblindness. Woopydo. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and boots (which i<br/>\ngot) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves or breastplates<br/>\nyet :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
