Use your invise song and hit guk and perma to<br/>\nget shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>\nboth dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>\nlore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and thay<br/>\nwilling let you loot and watch your back. Good luck to you you will need 110<br/>\npp to by gems to do quest.  Maybe another 100 pp if you buy your lambert.<br/>\nLambert stones are acutiong around 100 pp ( i will not pay that im to<br/>\ncheep )<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

I have in the neighborhood of 850pp.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of barbed,<br/>\netc.  A few pieces of bronze.

I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the<br/>\nequivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question<br/>\nis - is it worth it?
