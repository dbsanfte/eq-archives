We got lost big <br/>\n&gt; time in there,<br/>\n&gt; its a very cool layout for a dungeon and was fun running <br/>\n&gt; around lost in it,<br/>\n&gt; seems very big, we killed a librarian and got a tome (6int 6 wis) and<br/>\n&gt; basically ran around killing everything in sight. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But anyways, thats not the main reason i writing this email, my main<br/>\n&gt; question is where do i go to get the coin (and whats it from) from the<br/>\n&gt; xolvarg or wahtever he&#39;s called  and also, what the hell is a Spectral<br/>\n&gt; Pestle for from the spectral guardians.... they&#39;re no drop <br/>\n&gt; and alakazams has<br/>\n&gt; no info on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One last question, anything else i should pick up while im there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Minkin 37 bard<br/>\n&gt; -Rakka 52 necro  &lt;-- he&#39;s camping the place as its easier for <br/>\n&gt; him then the<br/>\n&gt; bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.
