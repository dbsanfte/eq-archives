It&#39;s really<br/>\nquite simple:  Anytime the thread skews completely away from Bards and/or<br/>\nthreatens to become (or has already become) inflammatory, I request that we<br/>\nstop discussing it (which is all the Kabong! is - I&#39;m not going to<br/>\nunsubscribe someone because they responded to a Kabong!ed thread).  The<br/>\nlast thread I Kabong!ed primarily because I&#39;ve seen that same thread<br/>\ndegenerate over and over into a campers/twinkers suck/you suck/no you suck<br/>\nflame war, and since the topic really wasn&#39;t Bard-specific, it seemed<br/>\nappropriate to Kabong! before we had our own li&#39;l weenie roast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only human, and I&#39;m not a fascist dictator - if I make a decision you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like, tell me about it.  Tell me that you want to discuss this topic,<br/>\nor get some input from the group.  As long as we don&#39;t start flinging<br/>\ninsults, I&#39;m a happy camper ;)  Erm.. twinker... erm... nevermind.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nModerator<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. For those of you who may not be aware, our original forum moderator<br/>\nand creator, Toren, has left the list.  I am in the process of acquiring<br/>\nfull moderator status on it.  We have 380+ members right now, and I&#39;d<br/>\ncertainly like to see us continue to grow.  We also have 5MB of space for<br/>\nuploading Bard-related files, if anyone needs to.
