And easy enough to test, if you doubt me.  Put a<br/>\nrusty bastard sword (or some other very slow 1h weapon) in your offhand, and<br/>\na dagger in the primary.  Time the pierce attacks.  They will go off every 2<br/>\nseconds (provided the dagger you use is a 20 delay weapon) without fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Mr. Kim may be confused at what I was stating.  The speed of each<br/>\nweapon, in each hand, is the basis for each roundtime, and I apologize if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make that clear enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as weapon speed in the offhand, it does matter, and it can be a huge<br/>\nadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, the chances each individual swing is the same, no matter what speed<br/>\nweapon you use, but a faster weapon simply nets you many more swings, and as<br/>\nsuch, yields many more chances to activate.  Simply put, probability is in<br/>\nfavor of more successful attack resolutions with more speed.  Combat has a<br/>\nlarge random component, it makes sense to weight it as much as you can in<br/>\nyour favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one reason the exceptionally fast weapons such as the Demon Claw<br/>\n(5/19) CAN NOT be used in the offhand.  They are simply too fast and do to<br/>\nmuch base damage, so in order to maintain balance for the level range they<br/>\nare found at, they were tagged primary only.  There are more efficient<br/>\nweapons that can be dual wielded, but that efficiency is counterbalanced by<br/>\nthe higher delay, making them less effective in the secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Fun Bob &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 12, 1999 5:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Not really Bard specific<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dual Wield uses the weapons speed of your slowest weapon....<br/>\n&gt;So if you have a dagger with a delay of 6 and a axe with a delay of 15 or<br/>\n&gt;so, your dagger also has a delay of 15 now<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Saturday, June 12, 1999 11:48 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Not really Bard specific<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;On Sat, 12 Jun 1999, J.M.

HUGE.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;d disagree with this.  If you&#39;re using different speed<br/>\n&gt;&gt;weapons, the dual wield check seems to be asynchronous with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;your primary weapon.  I&#39;ve watched several times as my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;off-hand would swing, pause, primary, pause, off-hand, pause,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;primary, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If this is correct and the dual wield check is made every<br/>\n&gt;&gt;swing cycle of the off-hand weapon, then the weapon speed does<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not matter.  If your dual wield goes off 30% of the time, then<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it will increase your damage 30% regardless of what the weapon<br/>\n&gt;&gt;speed is.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;*Most* of the times dual-wield succeeds it seems to be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;sychronized, so there may be more to it.  Perhaps it only goes<br/>\n&gt;&gt;asynchronous after a successful dual wield, and after a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;failure the next check is synchronous with your primary hand?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;That seems a rather convoluted way to program it; but if<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that&#39;s the case, then Mr. Capozzi is correct, although the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;increase in damage is not quite HUGE :-), and this advantage<br/>\n&gt;&gt;becomes less the better you get at dual wield.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;&gt;John H.
