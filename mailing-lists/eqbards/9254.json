Some of these I&#39;ve blatantly<br/>\nripped off from others (wish I could give credit, but I can&#39;t remember the<br/>\nnames.  You know who you are).<br/>\n<br/>\n* A song that drains all the bards mana (requires full mana?) and teleports<br/>\nthe entire group to a random bard guild.  Basically a bard &quot;evac&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n* A party CHA increasing song.  This would have some interesting uses.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Chords of Chaos : Radius effect that would randomly alter non-party<br/>\n&quot;hate-lists&quot; and targets.  Some MOBs might frenzy on the bard (or any other<br/>\nrandom party member), some MOBs might attack other MOBs, some MOBs might<br/>\nflee, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas... anyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
