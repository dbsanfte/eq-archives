All I have to say is three words:  Events, Dragons, Planes. I don t give a rat s behind about normal terra combat.

We have the<br/>\n  songs and powers already for standard mob combat.  I want to be useful<br/>\n  for big things, not exp/item farming.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Everyone in their brother is gonna do clops/dino/bugs, etc to earn<br/>\n  lots of fast exp (not to mention any new zones in Kunark).  Those<br/>\n  creatures we already have the capability of defeating right now.<br/>\n  I can fight seafuries until I&#39;m around L55.  Sure it&#39;s boring, but<br/>\n  it&#39;s steady and easy exp.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If 3 or 4 of our songs incapacitated us in some way and were<br/>\n  tremendously powerful ...so powerful all groups would want a bard...<br/>\n  then yes, I&#39;m willing to give up being able to chain-sing those<br/>\n  songs and keep them manabased.  (Mana = time directly anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we had a song that x2 /all/ damage from the party, there&#39;s no<br/>\n  way that isn&#39;t going to be controlled.  Recycle time doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n  with us, our songs are all alike.  The manabar is used as a time<br/>\n  cycle control.  So, double damage to the party at no cost?  Just<br/>\n  as a regular song?  F&#39;no, Verant would never allow it.  But if it<br/>\n  cost like 50 mana per tick, that&#39;s 120 seconds of straight singing.<br/>\n  /Plenty/ long enough to kill a dragon or god.  If I had this song<br/>\n  right now and could only play it 2 mins before I ran out of mana,<br/>\n  I bet I&#39;d be in a dragon/god group /every,every,every/ time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not fighting skeletons or polar bears anymore.  There&#39;s no reason<br/>\n  to upgrade our existing songs, they should grow with us in the <br/>\n  expansion.  We need brand new songs that use mana control for very<br/>\n  powerful effects.  And like I said, that&#39;s only a quarter of the <br/>\n  songs as an estimate.  The rest would be standard no cost songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
