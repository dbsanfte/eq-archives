The Blade Fiend spawns in<br/>\nthe room just inside the porch near the back left side of the House.  I know<br/>\nthis because, I currently own two of these wonderfull daggers that I got<br/>\nmyself both times.  Both times the Lesser blade fiend spawned in the same<br/>\nspot.  He is a rare spawn.  I got one dagger when I was 20th level (over a<br/>\nmonth ago) and another one just last night :))<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currenly duel wielding the Dragoon Dirk in my primary hand and the<br/>\nPuguis in my off hand.  My second Puguis is in the bank :)<br/>\n<br/>\nClearing out the rumors :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet &lt;Mischief&gt;<br/>\n23rd Level Human Bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ben Wilson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruldaas@...\">ruldaas@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 15, 1999 3:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Pugius Dagger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ben Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruldaas@...\">ruldaas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a friendly bard for only<br/>\n<br/>\n25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its damage ratio is <br/>\njust a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>\nincreases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?  It <br/>\nlooks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>\never seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so any <br/>\nhelp would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>\ngraphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRuldaas Riverdance<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
