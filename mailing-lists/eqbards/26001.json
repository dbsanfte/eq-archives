It is bard only and a horn graphic but it is only range<br/>\n&gt; &gt;equipable. It has a clickable slow and a load of awesome stats. I think it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dropped off something or other in VT. They logged me on to loot it so it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would not rot. They say it&#39;s effect doesn&#39;t stack with our slow song. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;haven&#39;t had a chance to test it yet. They also got the ancient mana song<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me. I have not had the time to play in the last couple weeks due to an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;avalanche of RL stuff. Nothing bad, just loads of various crap that leaves<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little time to play. I hope to get back in the swing when PoP comes out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also if you haven&#39;t heard, another nifty bard/rogue item drops in Fungus<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Grove. It&#39;s a cloak that goes in the ammo slot with a rightclick self<br/>\n&gt;invis.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is off the named guy that spawns when you do the ring, which is a ton<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of fun btw and doable with a group.
