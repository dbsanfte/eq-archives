Yellows and reds may resist too much.  Could still<br/>\n&gt; work but you make take a lot of damage.  Against blues I don&#39;t lose much<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; all with this technique.  Start off with chain, then fear and then start<br/>\n&gt; whacking them from behind.  I&#39;ve been using Furfils as the 3d song to<br/>\ndebuff<br/>\n&gt; their resist rate.  Bellow might be a good option for you.  Biggest thing<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be concerned with is that you don&#39;t aggro a second mob while chasing the<br/>\n&gt; first one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a similar note:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Grouped with another 35 bard last night on E&#39;ci in Frontier Mtns.  Lots of<br/>\n&gt; blues in their for us to fight.  Told her I intended to use the chain/fear<br/>\n&gt; technique.  She had never heard of the technique before.  She told me not<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; pull any casters.  I told her to continuously pixie strike the caster to<br/>\n&gt; interrupt their casts.  With both of us doing it we shouldn&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; problems.  She said 1) I weave 4 songs ALL the time, never just one and 2)<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; never fight casters if I can avoid it.  I then asked her if she read this<br/>\n&gt; list or Concert Hall board.  Said she didn&#39;t have time for message boards<br/>\n&gt; and hated mailing list spam.  I tried my best to tell her about some of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; tricks bards could use to defeat mobs.  She said BAH I&#39;m a tank.  I<br/>\nlaughed<br/>\n&gt; to myself.  Pulled a mob and was killing it easily when another mob joined<br/>\n&gt; in.  She just kept swinging away on first mob so I backed out, charmed the<br/>\n&gt; second one and had it finish off the first mob.  Then noticed she had quit<br/>\n&gt; the group.  Was already low in HPs so decided to zone instead of fighting<br/>\n&gt; the second mob.  Saw her on the other side and tore into her.  She said<br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; dropped the group because I backed out of the fight and she was taking all<br/>\n&gt; the damage.  I asked her if she was aware of how our charm song was used.<br/>\n&gt; She said BAH our charm song was a wasted song and that she never used it.<br/>\n&gt; On a whim I asked her what her max charisma was.  She came back with 89.<br/>\n&gt; She then started to criticize me for trying to use &quot;bard tricks&quot; to defeat<br/>\n&gt; mobs instead of pure melee.  At that point I decided she was a lost cause<br/>\n&gt; and I wasn&#39;t gonna try to educate her anymore on how to play a bard.  It<br/>\n&gt; just strikes me as odd that at this stage of the game you still find<br/>\nplayers<br/>\n&gt; who have no freaking idea how to play their class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
