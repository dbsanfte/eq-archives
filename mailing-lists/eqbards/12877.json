At the time, I was around 24th level.  I remember it well because I<br/>\nwas in Unrest at the time we had the discussion.  At 24th level, I could<br/>\nwalk around the outside and first floor of Unrest fairly safely.  About the<br/>\nonly thing that could see thru the invis was a carrion ghoul or higher.  I<br/>\nleft Unrest and didn&#39;t go back until I was 30th level.  Last week I went all<br/>\nthe way to the ghost room without getting attacked.  Along the way I passed<br/>\na dark terror, werebat, barbed bone skele and festering hag.  Don&#39;t think<br/>\nthe first two are considered undead but the last two are for certain.  I<br/>\nknow for certain the barbed and festering hag conned indifferent to me,<br/>\nindicating they didn&#39;t see thru the invis song.  Of particular note is that<br/>\nthe barbed conned blue to me while the hag was even.  When I was 24th level,<br/>\nthese two were both higher level than me and definately saw thru invis. IMO,<br/>\nI think bard invis working against undead, at least the ones in Unrest, is a<br/>\nfactor of both your level and randomness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Verant decided to give us universal invis to undead somewhere down the<br/>\nroad, to me the solution is simple.  Make it where the invis song, when<br/>\nequipping a magical flute, works against undead.  Of course this would<br/>\nrequire them to add a magical flute into the game other than those dropped<br/>\nby gods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; I hate to say this but Invis to undead is pointless.  Sonorious<br/>\n&gt; Clouding -IS- invisibility to live or Undead with modification to level.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; active.  As soon as I dropped it I was attacked.  I have walked through<br/>\n&gt; befallen with the same results.  I have no doubt that our clouding is a<br/>\n&gt; universal invisability and was intended as one, there for we do not need<br/>\n&gt; invis vs undead.  I think the problem is that many of you who have had<br/>\n&gt; troubles with this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; of range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become visiable,<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; are trying to hide from undead levels much higher then you where it I<br/>\n&gt; guess<br/>\n&gt; resisted the song.  I personally would like to see a true mem blur song..<br/>\n&gt; except GZ and crew are more worried about enchanters and balancing us to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; lesser the ever present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief,<br/>\n&gt; then the actual usefulness of bards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Adon Draigcanwyr 23 chorus of Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Child of Cathar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t buy into the theory that mobs get a saving throw to detect<br/>\n&gt; invisibility.  If they can see invis, they see invis.  If they can&#39;t, and<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re wearing it, you&#39;re invis.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested thru the toes of<br/>\n&gt; Ice Giants in Permafrost to recover a friends corpse at level 27.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; also<br/>\n&gt; been seen (unknowingly) and drew a train of undead to the Blood Pool in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest around the same level (can&#39;t think of any mob in the path that was<br/>\n&gt; major red to me).  I was the ONLY one in my group, and I assure you that I<br/>\n&gt; did nothing to break invis.  There may be some invis to undead aspect to<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; songs, but it&#39;s not because the mob gets a saving throw.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
