My friends and i<br/>\nhad made a trip to Everlost and met an ice boned skeleton.  That was the<br/>\nfirst time i saw the message &quot;you try to slash an ice boned skel but he is<br/>\nINVULNERABLE!&quot;  Ack!  what is that?  Well, you need magical weapons to hit<br/>\ncertain monsters and &quot;combine&quot; weaps are ones you can purchase.  A combine<br/>\ndagger goes for about 33pp, long sword and scimitars about 62pp.  They are<br/>\nsold at the gypsy camps in North Karana, Lavastorm and Rathe Mountains.  Of<br/>\nall 3 places, I&#39;d say Rathe Mountains is the safest although perhaps<br/>\nfurthest one to get to.  Lavastorm has lots of fire elementals that can<br/>\nattack and they are nasty.  North Karana has griffins and lions and such<br/>\nthat come right thru the gypsy camp.  Rathe Mts has far fewer monsters so<br/>\nvery close to the camp but it woould be quite a trek to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great magical weapon is the Dragoon Dirk. They are sold fairly often<br/>\nfor 40 to 60pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs (yes still - but Innie died and i am only a bub from<br/>\n49)<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; a HQ bear skin I&#39;d looted.
