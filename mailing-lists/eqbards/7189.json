Brangwen, is<br/>\nit possible that you are playing with the mino horn<br/>\ninstead of with the flute? It has been told that using<br/>\nthe mino horn causes the bard not to dance. I can<br/>\nunderstand since blowing through a horn ripped from<br/>\nthe head of a mino would hardly make me want to dance.<br/>\nThat is why I play my flute, even when I&#39;m not<br/>\nunderwater!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
