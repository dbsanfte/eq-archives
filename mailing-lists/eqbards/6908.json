I have never even purchased the 14th level song. <br/>\n&gt;  I just wrote<br/>\n&gt; it off as useless.  I will have to purchase it and try it out.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe that since this song now has at lease some effect, that they<br/>\n&gt; probably wont even consider replacing it.  If they were to <br/>\n&gt; start adding more<br/>\n&gt; and more lore to items, I think that this would fit our class <br/>\n&gt; more than<br/>\n&gt; anything else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I imagine sitting in a tavern or at a player congregation <br/>\n&gt; point.  Examining<br/>\n&gt; rare items for players and relaying the story to them.  It <br/>\n&gt; could be really<br/>\n&gt; cool.  Heck, we could do that now and non-bards would never <br/>\n&gt; know.  I can see<br/>\n&gt; it now, it would be like the psycic hotline *grin*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Newbie:\tHey can you tell me the lore on this minotaur axe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bard:\t\tSure, lets take a look at it.....( rubs the axe on his<br/>\n&gt; forhead )  Ahhhh.. Its comming to me now... .. this axe belonged to a<br/>\n&gt; minotaur...   oohh  a very lonely minotaur...  Oh no..   The <br/>\n&gt; minotaur&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; parents have split up and now he is very sad... oh wait.. I <br/>\n&gt; think.. ermm...<br/>\n&gt; yes.. the original owner of this Axe is dead!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Newbie:\tOooohh.. Wow....cool...

Just last night I pulled out several items in <br/>\n&gt; my bank that <br/>\n&gt;      had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on <br/>\n&gt; them.  To my <br/>\n&gt;      surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems <br/>\n&gt; that any item <br/>\n&gt;      that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra <br/>\n&gt; info with the <br/>\n&gt;      song.  Nice touch.  Don&#39;t know when they implemented this but I <br/>\n&gt;      finished 2 quests last night with the help of this song and will <br/>\n&gt;      finish the third when I get to Qeynos.  This song is <br/>\n&gt; still not a real <br/>\n&gt;      heavyweight but it actually works now and more <br/>\n&gt; importantly Verant is <br/>\n&gt;      actively using it so they will not be receptive to removing it.  <br/>\n&gt;      Perhaps the level 22 song.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      your suggestions<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      1 and 2  Great ideas!<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      3.  They&#39;ll never do it but would be nice.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      4.  I seem to have a perpetual taunt stamped on my <br/>\n&gt; forehead. &lt;gr&gt; I <br/>\n&gt;      certainly don&#39;t need a taunt song.  <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      5.  see 3 above<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      Another great idea they&#39;ll never do.  A song that acts <br/>\n&gt; like the ranger <br/>\n&gt;      track skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________ Reply Separator<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Petiton to replace level 14 song<br/>\n&gt; Author:  Non-HP-g4mntofcr (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>) at <br/>\n&gt; HP-ColSprings,shargw5<br/>\n&gt; Date:    9/21/99 2:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it <br/>\n&gt; back from the <br/>\n&gt; list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end <br/>\n&gt; up getting it <br/>\n&gt; posted twice.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Fellow bards,<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; I came into work today and there were relatively few messages <br/>\n&gt; on the list. <br/>\n&gt; In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the <br/>\n&gt; following proposal.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets <br/>\n&gt; submit a petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are <br/>\n&gt; aware, the song <br/>\n&gt; currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already <br/>\n&gt; identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The <br/>\n&gt; only situations I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; have heard of the song providing any additional information <br/>\n&gt; is when it is <br/>\n&gt; sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the <br/>\n&gt; head used to be <br/>\n&gt; attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you <br/>\n&gt; are turning in <br/>\n&gt; the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses <br/>\n&gt; for this song.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a <br/>\n&gt; song to replace <br/>\n&gt; it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the <br/>\n&gt; power of the new <br/>\n&gt; song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think minor <br/>\n&gt; versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved. <br/>\n&gt;  The new song <br/>\n&gt; should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request <br/>\n&gt; that everyone <br/>\n&gt; submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level <br/>\n&gt; song should be. <br/>\n&gt; Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which <br/>\n&gt; ones we think <br/>\n&gt; have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit <br/>\n&gt; the petition <br/>\n&gt; to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked <br/>\n&gt; in the order we<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; vote on.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; 1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and <br/>\n&gt; Hymn.  The <br/>\n&gt; power of the song can either be the same as the two original <br/>\n&gt; songs or toned <br/>\n&gt; down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; 2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge <br/>\n&gt; skill.  The <br/>\n&gt; amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get <br/>\n&gt; when you sing <br/>\n&gt; Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an <br/>\n&gt; instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect <br/>\n&gt; of the song.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; 3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards <br/>\n&gt; guild.  This <br/>\n&gt; song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it <br/>\n&gt; in order for <br/>\n&gt; Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in <br/>\n&gt; outdoor zones (no<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a <br/>\n&gt; high skill <br/>\n&gt; level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you <br/>\n&gt; miss a note and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of <br/>\n&gt; time before you <br/>\n&gt; can try it again.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; 4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond <br/>\n&gt; that or normal <br/>\n&gt; bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters <br/>\n&gt; are getting <br/>\n&gt; mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if <br/>\n&gt; someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; 5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think this <br/>\n&gt; one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can <br/>\n&gt; include it if <br/>\n&gt; thats what everyone wants.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any <br/>\n&gt; modifications to these <br/>\n&gt; that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise <br/>\n&gt; this Thursday for <br/>\n&gt; the next week.
