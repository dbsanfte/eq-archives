(smile).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The Fear Plane... great loot, great XP... HARD monsters.... <br/>\n&gt; or so that&#39;s all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve &quot;heard&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You enter the zone, instant death. You enter the zone, <br/>\n&gt; instand backstabs for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;400-800 points. You enter the zone, you can&#39;t leave except <br/>\n&gt; by Evac and even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;THAT only works 10% of the time. The list of horror stories goes on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;WHAT is TRUTH? Can you fight at the zone and flee if it gets bad? How<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;different&quot; does magic work? Do our songs work??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ANY info and tales appreciated!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tallonn - 38th Verse<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bertox<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ******<br/>\n&gt; THIS IS GONNA BE JUST CHOK FULL OF SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IF <br/>\n&gt; THIS SORT OF<br/>\n&gt; THING RUINS YOUR FUN. <br/>\n&gt; ******<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alright, i fancy myself some sort of veteran on the fear <br/>\n&gt; plane after quite<br/>\n&gt; a few expeditions. Its hard. I die frequently being a bard of <br/>\n&gt; the 48th lvl.<br/>\n&gt; Most are stupid deaths like the expedition splits up and i <br/>\n&gt; get ganked. A<br/>\n&gt; few are just bad luck where 3 things show up and you get <br/>\n&gt; nailed too fast<br/>\n&gt; for even a loh. When you zone in you will be on a hill top. <br/>\n&gt; 90% of the time<br/>\n&gt; nothing will be near you and you can safely sit there for an <br/>\n&gt; hour. ONE time<br/>\n&gt; i zoned in and got backstabbed for 400 by a scareling who <br/>\n&gt; then teleported<br/>\n&gt; me away from the hill (never that far, but if you havent been <br/>\n&gt; there you can<br/>\n&gt; run the wrong way and get into a lot of trouble). I died <br/>\n&gt; shortly after when<br/>\n&gt; i got back to the hill and he ganked me from behind again with another<br/>\n&gt; incredible backstab. My team zoned in right as a died. Ah <br/>\n&gt; well, after at<br/>\n&gt; least 30 zone ins, thats only happened once. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right after you get into the fear plane and everybody is <br/>\n&gt; there, i recommend<br/>\n&gt; heading south ( i think south) to the corner of the zone. Its <br/>\n&gt; just down the<br/>\n&gt; hill and instead of running the risk of being hit from all 4 <br/>\n&gt; directions,<br/>\n&gt; you only have to worry about one and a half. Then have some <br/>\n&gt; adventurous<br/>\n&gt; soul pull to there. Haromony or the bard lull or a high lvl <br/>\n&gt; enchanter can<br/>\n&gt; really help with pulling, otherwise you might get more than <br/>\n&gt; one which is<br/>\n&gt; bad. Two sucks. Three you better have three full groups. 4, <br/>\n&gt; start thinking<br/>\n&gt; evac. All of my fear plane expeditions have involved three <br/>\n&gt; full groups,<br/>\n&gt; with everybody 40+. This makes it fairly safe, though at <br/>\n&gt; least one person<br/>\n&gt; dies every hour. personal gates and evac all have the same chances of<br/>\n&gt; succeding as everywhere else. I have witnessed no wierd behavior from<br/>\n&gt; spells or songs, everything works as before. I especially <br/>\n&gt; loved it when i<br/>\n&gt; used appaling screech on Cazic Thules fright henchman and he ran.<br/>\n&gt; Delightfully ironic. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A quick mob run down and some tactics :<br/>\n&gt; Spiders drop cryosilk which is for the magi classes. The robe <br/>\n&gt; is incredible<br/>\n&gt; and like nothing you have ever seen. Plus they drop a mage <br/>\n&gt; shield thats<br/>\n&gt; like the shimmering orb. <br/>\n&gt; Scarelings teleport you randomly around and like to backstab <br/>\n&gt; for outrageous<br/>\n&gt; amounts of damage. The teleport is never that far, but if you get<br/>\n&gt; disorientated and run the wrong way.... They drop nothing <br/>\n&gt; special that we<br/>\n&gt; have found(besides high lvl words and runes, which are super <br/>\n&gt; common in the<br/>\n&gt; fear plane, our lvl 50 necro just got her 49th lvl pet spell, <br/>\n&gt; and all the<br/>\n&gt; wizs have their ice come runes). <br/>\n&gt; Phantasms fear you which can cause all kinds of problems. <br/>\n&gt; They drop nothing<br/>\n&gt; special<br/>\n&gt; The little toads drop grey shaman armour and fear you also. <br/>\n&gt; The worry wraiths drop the purple cleric armour and do <br/>\n&gt; something called<br/>\n&gt; gravity flux. If you have levitate then you get thrown up <br/>\n&gt; like 10 feet and<br/>\n&gt; you float down. If you DONT have levitate then look forward <br/>\n&gt; to upwards of<br/>\n&gt; 600 pts of damage from the fall. Bards are AWESOME for these <br/>\n&gt; because we<br/>\n&gt; just turn on the group levitate song and nobody gets hurt and <br/>\n&gt; you dont ahve<br/>\n&gt; to worry about the visible levitate bug. <br/>\n&gt; Glare lords. Avoid these at all costs, they have a rain spell <br/>\n&gt; that can wipe<br/>\n&gt; out an entire party in no time. if you are getting rained on <br/>\n&gt; by a glare<br/>\n&gt; lord MOVE. Otherwise you will die, and die fast. They drop <br/>\n&gt; nothing special<br/>\n&gt; that we have found<br/>\n&gt; Boogeymen. My personal favorite :), they drop the gold bard <br/>\n&gt; only armour.<br/>\n&gt; Boogeymen will fear you, but other than that they are a <br/>\n&gt; pushover. So far we<br/>\n&gt; have found arms, gloves, and boots (boots i got myself). <br/>\n&gt; Shiverback gorillas. my second favorite cause they just hit <br/>\n&gt; hard and dont<br/>\n&gt; do any crazy stuff like all the other mobs. They drop monk <br/>\n&gt; only armour like<br/>\n&gt; gloves that give serpentsight and a very visually unigue set <br/>\n&gt; of greeves. We<br/>\n&gt; got 1 monk in our group that has almost the entire set and it <br/>\n&gt; looks great. <br/>\n&gt; Amgdylan warrios drop the russet armour which is usuable by all plate<br/>\n&gt; wearing classes including rogues and rangers. It looks like a sort of<br/>\n&gt; copper or bronze sheen.  Great stuff. <br/>\n&gt; Amgdylan knights drop the black shadow knight armour. They ht <br/>\n&gt; so watch it<br/>\n&gt; Gorgons drop the green chain armour for druids. Got almost an <br/>\n&gt; entire set<br/>\n&gt; already for one druid and it looks great. These guys stun for <br/>\n&gt; a long time<br/>\n&gt; so carefull pulling them. <br/>\n&gt; Tentacle Tormentors. Drop the green plate for rangers. These <br/>\n&gt; guys are just<br/>\n&gt; like the ones found in najena, have your back to a wall when <br/>\n&gt; fighting them<br/>\n&gt; Dracolich. So far he has dropped the bone razor (awesome <br/>\n&gt; rogue only dirk),<br/>\n&gt; staff of undead legions (necro only staff), and some other <br/>\n&gt; staff that i<br/>\n&gt; forget which only ogre and troll shamans can use. <br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule. Havent killed him yet cause the zone keeps <br/>\n&gt; crashing for us<br/>\n&gt; everytime we almost have it cleared. Mass deaths always cause <br/>\n&gt; everytbody<br/>\n&gt; logs in one at a time and gets slaughterd. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So is it worth it? Definatly, the items are just incredible <br/>\n&gt; there. If its<br/>\n&gt; armour, its no drop though. Thats all i can think of right now :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 48 bard of tunare. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes there is a gate out btw, but its just inside the castle <br/>\n&gt; so i heavily,<br/>\n&gt; heavily recommend evac :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
