They re doing what you re suggesting.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-474442991\">I understand what you&#39;re saying, but aren&#39;t the people saying &quot;Price Check<br/>\non a XXXX!!!!&quot; asking around on their server?  They&#39;re doing what you&#39;re<br/>\nsuggesting.  Also, if you notice the reasoning (after the approximate prices<br/>\nI listed) took into consideration some of the &quot;Are you happy&quot; type of<br/>\nquestions you asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do understand the concept and the flaws in the &quot;priceguide&quot;<br/>\nsystem, and you can peruse the actual bids and weed out the obvious fakes.<br/>\nI do not believe that the priceguides are THE price for any item.  But, I<br/>\nknow that Xegony is one of the original servers, thus sharing more similar<br/>\neconomies to more servers than any that came later.  Starting with this<br/>\nprice as a guideline is a safe bet.  It was a little easier pre-Kunark to<br/>\nask around the server as the items had been around for awhile and more<br/>\npeople knew their approximate value.  With all the new items from RoK, it<br/>\nmakes it much more difficult to even know WHAT exists out there, much less<br/>\nknow the value for it.  I am surprised constantly by the new items I loot<br/>\nand have to consider whether the item is a &quot;cash item&quot; or a trade item.  And<br/>\npeople I ask many times have no clue to the price and actually ask me the<br/>\nstats! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several things that establish a price.  Obviously Supply and<br/>\nDemand are the biggest.  How badly somebody wants an item is a 3rd.  A high<br/>\nend Ranger Only sword would go for more than a Bard Only sword with the<br/>\nexact same stats.  Why?  There are more rangers than bards.  If both those<br/>\nsame items were pre-Kunark they&#39;d go for less on an aged server than a new<br/>\nserver.  Why?  There are more items in population.  If you look closely and<br/>\nconsider the flaws, the pricing guides all take this into consideration<br/>\nobviously as these are (hopefully) REAL trades.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the other statement someone made about buying a car... I would<br/>\nalways check priceguides and alternatives first... I may be happy with the<br/>\nprice, but I would sure be pissed off to find out after it was too late that<br/>\nI was ripped off.  Even if I could afford the payments and they didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto high at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used the priceguides as just that, guides, for a long time now, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve had lots of success with it.  I&#39;ve had people send me tells saying,<br/>\n&quot;You&#39;ll never get 30k in trade value for an Arbitor&#39;s Longsword&quot;... I laugh<br/>\nto myself and tell them, &quot;Okay&quot; and proceed with dealing with the person<br/>\noffering that or more.  If there is no person offering that or more, then I<br/>\nobviously would lower my standard, but what they&#39;re telling me is THEY would<br/>\nnot pay that for the item.  That&#39;s perfectly fine... I&#39;ll trade it to<br/>\nsomeone else. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Selo&#39;s Drum... I&#39;d more than likely use my tambourine and try<br/>\nto loot the selo&#39;s drum than trade 15k in value for it... But, I&#39;d be ALOT<br/>\nmore open to trading 15k in value for it if I knew that it was a typical<br/>\nprice and I wasn&#39;t being ripped off.  It&#39;s on my list of WANTS, but there<br/>\nare many items on that list and I only have a limited &quot;budget&quot; to work with.<br/>\n:)  I will probably only see ONE Arbitor&#39;s Longsword in my Bardic life... I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to throw it away for JUST Singing Steel Gaunts, even tho I<br/>\nreally, no REALLY want them. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, in case anyone doesn&#39;t know ~ means &quot;approximately&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, these are just my opinions, I don&#39;t presume to think that everyone<br/>\nor &quot;anyone&quot; shares them, but I do know there is reasoning behind them. :)<br/>\nYMMV<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRandy Keith wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No offense but all those sites out there with &quot;Priceguides&quot; are worthless.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want to get an idea what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something is worth.

You&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Keep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
