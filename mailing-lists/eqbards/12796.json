The few replies<br/>\n&gt;it generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think and maybe it is<br/>\n&gt;something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  The command<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells you who all is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that zone.  As it stands right now, you can only find out who is in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>zone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;you are currently in.  This command would be a tremendous benefit to every<br/>\n&gt;player in the game, especially those without teleport and gate<br/>\n </span></blockquote>capabilities.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here is a prime example of its usefulness.  You log in to play and are in<br/>\n&gt;Highpass.  Not much action there so you decide you want to go to either<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule or Permafrost.  Getting to Cazic requires you to cross six<br/>\n&gt;zones.  Getting to Perma requires you to also cross six zones.  If you are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;class that has to run the entire distance, lets assume its gonna take you<br/>\n&gt;about 30 minutes to get to either place.  You decide to go to Permafrost<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;when you arrive there isn&#39;t anyone in their for you to group with.  You<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wasted at least an hour of playing time (30 minutes to get there plus the<br/>\n&gt;time to now run to Cazic).  Time spent needlessly running is not fun, no<br/>\n&gt;matter which class you play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A /who command that allowed you to see the zone population of zones outside<br/>\n&gt;the zone you are presently in would prevent a situation like this occuring.<br/>\n&gt;While still in Highpass, you type in /who permafrost.  You could then send<br/>\n&gt;/tell messages to someone in the zone near your level to see if you can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>join<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;their group.  If you don&#39;t have luck with Permanfrost, you can then type in<br/>\n&gt;/who cazic and try there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>\n&gt;Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by adding this<br/>\n&gt;/who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement it is that it<br/>\n&gt;is too hard to code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
