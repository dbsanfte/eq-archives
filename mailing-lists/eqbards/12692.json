When nothing else to sing, boost stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nJig of Vigor for that tired SK who can barely lift his 2h sword after<br/>\nfighting 3 undead frogloks to finish the fourth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric for when you feel like helping younger players, and<br/>\nfor when corpses oddly vanish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccelerando for travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHymn of Restoration I will often mix with Clarity at a ratio of 1:3<br/>\n(counting messages).  A warrior who&#39;s only a bubble down on health,<br/>\nsitting waiting for the next pull, or an enchanter who took a few hits, no<br/>\nneed to waste the cleric&#39;s (or druid/shaman&#39;s for that matter) hard-medded<br/>\nmana when a few button pushes and a few seconds is all it takes (restoring<br/>\n~50hp over the duration of 1 pulse).<br/>\n<br/>\nLament for pulling.  Pool room Solusek B, I use it liberally to break up<br/>\nspawns, to pull singles so I don&#39;t have to deal with needing crowd control<br/>\nand instead can buff or debuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhythms and psalms for resistances, damage shield is negligible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharismatic Carillon to complete quests or raise/lower prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBellow lasted at most 8 levels for me.  Someone said long ago that there<br/>\nwill come a time in every bard&#39;s life they put bellow aside for a more<br/>\neffective song.  Having heard that before reaching level 12, I was<br/>\nstrongly aware of just how ineffective the bardic kick becomes when<br/>\nmeasured against what could be sung instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nCataloging Libretto for the new quests.  Most recent use was to identify<br/>\nwhich Rune of Ivy a guildmate had.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby I put aside for Pixie Strike for a few reasons.  Often I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant the extra attention it gave, and the strike&#39;s mez lasted longer than<br/>\nthe lullaby&#39;s.  Yes, there is the given problem with false notification<br/>\n(or perhaps now better termed unnotified failure), but even with it I can<br/>\nalways use this song effectively with 1 or 2 extra mobs.  My charisma is<br/>\nbase 146, and I always ask for a charisma buff from an enchanter or shaman<br/>\nif present.  Now if there is an enchanter, they are of course the crowd<br/>\ncontrol diva, but just last night in the pool room, our puller (who was<br/>\nchallenged by the group cleric to get him OOM) brought in a Solusek<br/>\nshaman, 2 or 3 greaters and the Noble.  By the time we had beaten down a<br/>\nfew, the enchanter called OOM, and I took over the job of mezzing till we<br/>\nwere down to 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nAquatic Ayre I keep mem&#39;d as backup in Kedge.  It&#39;s not practical in a<br/>\ngroup situation under most circumstances (there was this time hunting with<br/>\na mage in OOT, we hid offshore and this song allowed him to med up some<br/>\nmana underwater, but that was a fairly unique situation), but can be<br/>\nuseful if exploring wherever underwater, or simply practicing swimming.<br/>\n<br/>\nDischord, Chords of Dissonance and the Chant series have never played a<br/>\nlarge role in my songbook.  Sure, I did the chords/discord thing back when<br/>\nsoloing Reavers gave experience, but the AE dots were put aside when crowd<br/>\ncontrol became more important, and the targetted dots don&#39;t give enough<br/>\noomph to be worthwhile in general.  That they can lower resistances makes<br/>\nthem good to carry in specific cases where your group has casters but<br/>\nnoone who can debuff (rather negative buff than simply remove buffs), but<br/>\nthen this has been the bard&#39;s job all along, to fill in the gaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Tangent: I always say that in a perfect world, the bard is superfluous,<br/>\nbut since perfection is rarely attainable in ad hoc groups, the bard<br/>\nbecomes useful.]<br/>\n<br/>\nShauri&#39;s Clouding was useful to hide parties from trains in live side<br/>\nlower guk, Unrest, Mistmoore, etc.  However at higher level camps, trains<br/>\neither aren&#39;t an issue or can see through invis.  The song remains useful<br/>\non a personal level throughout.<br/>\n<br/>\nLargo&#39;s melodic binding is the most underappreciated song in our<br/>\nrepertoire.  Some fights are short enough not to warrant enchanter/shaman<br/>\nslowdown, but weaving this in will reduce damage taken significantly.<br/>\nMultiple mobs pulled?  Sing a little binding, give the enchanter time to<br/>\nget his thralls placed with less chance for interruption.  No enchanter or<br/>\nshaman in group?  Binding becomes the song du jour.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a similar vein, Chains can be used as speedown when no druid, ranger,<br/>\nnecro or SK are present.  Also quite useful when running after mobs who<br/>\nthe snarer forgot to snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nMellifluous Motion is fun to play with people who don&#39;t know it&#39;s coming.<br/>\nYou should have heard the screaming when I accidentally hit this one<br/>\ninstead of hymn after a fight. -.-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody I didn&#39;t have a use for before, and still<br/>\ndon&#39;t now, especially with Antimagic Aria (targetted cancel magic).  I&#39;ll<br/>\nadmit I haven&#39;t had much use for the Aria either, but I did like being<br/>\nable to remove the Guise after I&#39;m done with it&#39;s ultravision effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord is a godsend to all human bards.  You don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow dark Norrath can be if you&#39;ve never walked it as a naked human<br/>\n(&quot;Follow the path?  What path?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nScreech.  Enough said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of the Sirens I gave up as a means of crowd control.  Sure it&#39;s nice<br/>\nhaving one of the extra mobs on your side for ten seconds, but after that<br/>\nit&#39;s all over you like Laffy Taffy in your cousin Amy&#39;s hair on a hot<br/>\nSunday family picnic.  Better to strike it out of commission altogether,<br/>\nand save the charming for Giant excursions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAria of Eagles, more fun than useful, although can make traversing<br/>\nwater/hilly zones less tedious/painful (avg Lavastorm trip for me deals<br/>\n250 non-melee, sometimes up to 400 if I&#39;m lucky; once I overshot the wall<br/>\nsolB is on, and was rather grateful to spash down in the lava below as the<br/>\nfall would have killed me :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity.  Staple, but don&#39;t let casters think it&#39;s better than it is.<br/>\nSlowing the mob with binding or chains will have the tanks requiring less<br/>\nhealing, which is more effective than a pulse of mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolidarity of Vision to learn new areas via the puller&#39;s eyes.  It&#39;s<br/>\nsusceptible to the same bugs all bind sight spells are, but works well<br/>\nenough in flattish areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirge is somewhat of a joke.  My first test of it was on a Freeport guard,<br/>\nit did a whopping 44 points of damage for 4.5 bubbles of mana.  Nice<br/>\nthought, but impractical overall, especially when it takes up a rather<br/>\ncrucial song slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nCassindra&#39;s Elegy for trade skills.  I for one am looking forward to my<br/>\nnext level. -.-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy looking for a group shout varies, but often is something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanter/druid/shaman/ranger/warrior/wizard/paladin/shadowknight (aka<br/>\nBard) seeking ensemble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate reading about how weak we are, how this or that should be changed<br/>\nor increased or whatever.  I knew my dodge cap when I took this job, I<br/>\nknew I wouldn&#39;t be the meleer my friends are, heck I just broke 1000hp<br/>\nbase last level.  Sure a bard&#39;s job changes slightly as they level, but<br/>\nit&#39;s the same as other classes.  Clerics in their teens nuke, enchanters<br/>\nare always seen with pets trailing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, 43rd composition in progress<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
