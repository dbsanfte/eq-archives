You want to cheat and cut<br/>\nin line, you deserve whatever you get by doing<br/>\nso. There&#39;s no way in Norrath that I&#39;d even<br/>\nconsider helping a level 35 player that didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow where the Karana&#39;s were or that Giants<br/>\ndon&#39;t &#39;give quests&#39;. They deserve anything evil<br/>\nthat happens to them in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I was level 5 I knew where every<br/>\nzone in the game was. I hadn&#39;t been to them<br/>\nall of course, but I knew where they were. By<br/>\nlevel 7 I&#39;d made the trip from Felwithe to<br/>\nErudin. A level 35 that didn&#39;t know? Hrmph.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t help cheaters. If you want to, feel<br/>\nfree. But you&#39;re doing nothing more than<br/>\nletting them know it&#39;s ok to be an idiot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
