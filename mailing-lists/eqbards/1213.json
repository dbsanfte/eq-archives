The only reason to upgrade to <br/>\nsteel was to save about 2 pounds of weight. The medium steel breastplate <br/>\nweighed more than the small bronze breastplate, with the same armor class, <br/>\nso it was useless to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I decided that saving 2 pounds of weight was worth 800 platinum. I <br/>\nstarted with only a 70 strength, so every pound is critical, and I had <br/>\nmanaged to build my bank account up to 1100 plat.  None of the players at <br/>\nmy level were selling anything for platinum -- all the higher level magic <br/>\ngoodies are auctioned as &quot;trade only.&quot;  So I didn&#39;t have anything better to <br/>\ndo with the money.  (By the way, if any of you are on Solusek Ro and have a <br/>\nGladius, Band of Flesh, or Traveller&#39;s Backpack available for sale or <br/>\ntrade, I&#39;m very interested.  I can offer an Ivory Bracelet, Savant&#39;s Cap, <br/>\nor Lizard Scale Cloak, or might be able to arrange a three-way trade for <br/>\nsomething else you want.  And for low level struggling bards on Solusek Ro, <br/>\nif you need help with something or a bit of cash to get you over a hump, <br/>\nfeel free to give me a call.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saving up now to convert my small bronze helmet into a small steel <br/>\nhelmet.  I just hope it&#39;s not as ugly as the bronze one!  Every other race <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen gets really cool looking bronze helmets.  The wood elf <br/>\nversion, according to my guildmates, makes me look like a push-pin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been making 50 plat or so per night-long lizard slaughter in Cazic. <br/>\n All weapons carried by Defenders and up are fine steel, selling for around <br/>\n5 plat to vendors or more if you take the time and trouble to find a player <br/>\nwho wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
