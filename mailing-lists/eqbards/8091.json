If<br/>\nthey continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>\npeace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>\nsong slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance of<br/>\ndying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.  Therefore, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me how to<br/>\nplay mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, the occasions where I run into people who don&#39;t believe me<br/>\nwhen I tell them the Jig has no effect on mana regen are becoming relatively<br/>\nfew.  I assume thats because the other bards on E&#39;ci (Faras, Kitasi, Aloro,<br/>\net al) have spread the word and a lot of people are now aware of how the<br/>\nsong works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;When people ask me to play Jig to increase mana, I use a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;condensed version of Talies explanation and they usually <br/>\n&gt; &gt;accept it.  If they don&#39;t, their problem not mine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I know Jig, a song intended for other purposes, does<br/>\n&gt; nothing for mana (has been tested and timed) you cannot <br/>\n&gt; dump that type of attitude out on your party.  As a bard<br/>\n&gt; you are responsible for group coordination through tactics<br/>\n&gt; and song, unless an enchanter has that current role in your<br/>\n&gt; group.  You also, imo, are there to keep the group solidly<br/>\n&gt; happy - with humor/jokes/antics.  If someone in my group <br/>\n&gt; asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>\n&gt; notion mind you) - I will happily do it.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>\n&gt; to mislead them, but if it makes them feel better, most of<br/>\n&gt; the time the extra security makes them play sharper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s called the Placebo Effect, a proven psych theory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 38th unchained melody.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
