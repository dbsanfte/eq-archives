When I was doing<br/>\nthe squad ring quest, I accidently gave the sherriff three<br/>\nRunnyeye warbeads and one shattered warbead, thus not getting<br/>\ncredit for turning in four.  After that I concentrated on orcs<br/>\nin WC and just turned in belts for about a week.  While in<br/>\nMisty to turn in the belts, I killed a goblin to save someone<br/>\nelse and got a Runnyeye warbead.  Curious to see if this would<br/>\nqualify as my 4th, I turned it in and sure enough I got<br/>\nexperience for having turned in 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, does anyone know how to raise faction with the clerics in<br/>\nRivervale?  It&#39;s annoying having to use a faction raising<br/>\nspell every time I want to recharge the ring.  They took out<br/>\nthe faction gains/losses for recharging/getting the ring when<br/>\nthey made it no-drop.  I suppose I could just destroy them and<br/>\nget another from the marshall, but I don&#39;t want to lose the<br/>\nring if they ever raise the faction requirement to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
