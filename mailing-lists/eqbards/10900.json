It works very well, fits all the patterns.<br/>\n  The top half is the maximum dmg, the lower half is the swing in secs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (DMG * MULTIPLIER + 1) / SPEED<br/>\n<br/>\n  MULTIPLIER = (LEVEL/10) if LEVEL &lt;= 20 then the MULTIPLIER is always 2.<br/>\n  SPEED      = (DELAY/10)<br/>\n<br/>\n  thus you get this formula to calc dmg/sec:<br/>\n<br/>\n  (DMG * (LEVEL/10) + 1) / (DELAY/10)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -------<br/>\n<br/>\n  A level 5 warrior with a 7/38 axe:  (multiplier is 2, level &lt;= 20)<br/>\n<br/>\n  (8 * 2 + 1) / (38/10) = 4.47 dmg/sec<br/>\n<br/>\n  A level 50 warrior with same 7/38 axe:<br/>\n<br/>\n  (8 * (50/10) + 1) / (38/10) = 10.79 dmg/sec<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  These are just maximum&#39;s per sec, averages need number of rounds,<br/>\n  dodging, monster parry/block, etc...  But you can assume the same<br/>\n  monster will block/parry/riposte you no matter what weapon you are<br/>\n  using, so that is a wash.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finally maxdmg/sec formula:<br/>\n<br/>\n  (WEAPON_DMG * (PLAYER_LEVEL/10) + 1) / (WEAPON_DELAY/10)<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
