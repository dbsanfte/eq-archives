Crawford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 02, 2000 3:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Drop Flags<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been a programmer for years.  Obviously some of you have as well.<br/>\nYou&#39;re over-analyzing this though.  All they&#39;d have to do is add one flag to<br/>\nthe client and one check to the drop process.  All in all roughly 4 lines of<br/>\ncode to do it clunky.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Flag on client<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd Flag<br/>\n<br/>\nCanDropItems = Binary<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd code to drop check<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen clicking in view area<br/>\nIf Isareaempty = no then opentradewindow<br/>\nElse<br/>\nIf CanDropItems = No then keepitemonmouse<br/>\nElse<br/>\nDrop Item<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the most elegant pseudocode but it should get the idea across.<br/>\nSure I may not have their exact process down but this would be a VERY easy<br/>\npatch to put in regardless of how they have it coded.  Even if the hook<br/>\nisn&#39;t already there it&#39;s 1 flag easily added to the engine.   It&#39;s not a<br/>\nmajor change to how the engine works.  They added the Destroy box in a 40kb<br/>\npatch during beta and I guarantee that wasn&#39;t in the client then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, Gordon has stated on at least 2 occasions that I can recall<br/>\nthat they have something like this on the &quot;list&quot; but it&#39;s not high priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
