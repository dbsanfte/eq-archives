Bards seem to<br/>\nbe affect less by this than other classes, but they are still affected. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout the internet sites and other helpful characters, we would never<br/>\nknow what some of our new songs/spells do(or don&#39;t do). EVERY other RPG<br/>\nI have ever played gave you a list of your spells and told you what they<br/>\ndid (at least in general).<br/>\n<br/>\nMany bard songs are self-evident, if not by title, then by the first<br/>\ntime you sing them, some are not so obvious. heck, the best bards on<br/>\nthis list sometimes argue about the effects of some of our songs, and<br/>\nthe worst ALWAYS seem to KNOW that the song has some other affect. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the best examples of this come from my other class, the druid.<br/>\nAt first level, I got &quot;Burst of Flame&quot; and &quot;Flame Lick&quot;, both are<br/>\nEVOCATION, both scribe with the little fire symbol. How am I suppossed<br/>\nto know what the do? How many bad spells do you have a margin for at<br/>\nFIRST level?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear people shouting all the time &quot;what does (insert spell here) do&quot;?<br/>\nWhy should we have to do this? why no spell book detailing the effects<br/>\n(or at least saying Level9 direct damage, etc.)?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
