First off, the<br/>\ndifference between good play and bad play in this game can be worlds apart<br/>\nbut there is this _huge_ middle part of merely mediocre play that a lot of<br/>\npeople fall into.  Most ad-hoc or pick-up groups are gonna be very mediocre.<br/>\nMost of the time, groups fite 1 or 2 mobs - the occasional bad pull and you<br/>\nhave to contend with crowd control. The occasional train and you need to<br/>\nevac.  You don&#39;t really see a lot of mid 20&#39;s trying multiple group raids -<br/>\neven though there are prolly good spots for this (Upper Guk, CT Tae room,<br/>\nAvatar room?).  So, it&#39;s not til mid 40&#39;s where you have the occasional<br/>\nplace where 2 6-packs are needed.  And then Dragon raids where it requires<br/>\nmultiple groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people just muddle their way to 50 - you don&#39;t get more xp for<br/>\nbetter play - you do get xp for just mindlessly killing guard after guard<br/>\nafter guard, or frog or kobold or spec or Cyndrella.  How many ppl ding 50<br/>\nin a Mistmoore Castle raid?  How many ppl lose xp in Planes raids?  But any<br/>\nways my point is  you don&#39;t _need_ to be good to get to the next level - you<br/>\nmerely need to endure (mostly boredom). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that brings us to the wiz-bang.  Last knight I was helping some friends<br/>\nin CT.  They were a mid-20&#39;s group and were camping the fish bowl (brown<br/>\nroom?) - this round room on the way to some temple - it was the first time<br/>\nfor me there so I was not real familiar - it might be on the way to the<br/>\navatar&#39;s room.  So they were SK, War, Druid, Bard, Wiz, Wiz. I was<br/>\nbabysitting and trying to pull singles for them.  Well the wiz bang would<br/>\nopen every time with his biggest nuke and take a beating.  And them I pulled<br/>\n2 and we got a room spawn.  Ok, should be no problem - I can pixie 2 of them<br/>\neasily or even attack and tank &#39;em.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got 2 lizzies messed nicely while they fight the other one.  Well, the<br/>\ntanks are fighting the other one and Mr Wiz-bang decides to nuke a mezzed<br/>\nliz - gimme a break!  Even after wards when we tried to talk about it - he<br/>\ntold us he just decided to nuke one of the mezzed ones as his way of helping<br/>\nkill it.  Who knows why this seemed like a good idea to him?  When we said<br/>\nassist the puller - he had no clue what we were talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd ya gotta remember that some players are real life 14 year&#39;s old.  Yes,<br/>\nlevel 50&#39;s can be 14 - although they are prolly lots closer to 15 &lt;g&gt; And I<br/>\nhave even run into the situation where I meet someone and get told &quot;this is<br/>\nsonso&#39;s brother...&quot;  Meaning its his older/younger playing the account<br/>\n(farming for some item - hehe.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I have taken to saying and it seems to help people lower<br/>\ntheir defenses when it&#39;s their turn to accept a tip is: &quot;Hey guys, if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see you medding or I forget to play heal song - just feel free to yell<br/>\nat me and say &#39;Sylly!  need mana/heal song&#39; and remember to say &#39;Sylly -<br/>\nStop song&#39; before you run to pull or before you cast invis - ok?&quot;  I try to<br/>\nset the tone a bit lighter so they can see I am willing to listen to them -<br/>\nmaybe they will listen to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJohn Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jht@...\">jht@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 15, 1999 1:15 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Song Taunting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: John Tatsukawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jht@...\">jht@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI can say from personal experience that it is annoying when<br/>\nother people are<br/>\n\t\ttelling me what songs to play, especially since I still hear<br/>\n&quot;play the jig&quot;<br/>\n\t\tfor mana.
