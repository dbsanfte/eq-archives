Maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nbroken, maybe there&#39;s a cap on the price benefits for charisma<br/>\nat 110, maybe it only helps with really expensive items.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is AC 2, which is not bad so it might be a good item to<br/>\nhave if we can verify any of the charisma effects that we&#39;ve<br/>\nspeculated about.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
