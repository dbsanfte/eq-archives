Our guild is planning an outing<br/>\n&gt;there this weekend and I would appreciate some advice on strategies and<br/>\n&gt;locations for hunting there.  We are going to try to take down the predator<br/>\n&gt;as well, would that be within the capability of a full group of 22-29&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt;(avg level 26).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I only ever hunted from the Fur Room (as described in those emails) so I can<br/>\nonly talk about that. My technique for pulling was:<br/>\n<br/>\nGo out looking playing Elemental Rhythms, carrying a lute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a wizard was in the pull I would switch to a drum, for the return trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nChain to pull, then Back to Elemental for the run back to the room.<br/>\nElemental during a wizard pull really seemed to save me a lot of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery, very often I would get stunned, you just have to breath deep and hope<br/>\nyour back is to the wall and wait it out, the Cleric would be waiting for<br/>\nme(gotta love a really diciplined group that trusts each other)...that is<br/>\nwhere the lute came in, the instant I would get unstunned I would start<br/>\nrunning and fire up Largo&#39;s Binding or Lull. When I got back to the room,<br/>\nstart with CoD, DDD, Binding, Anthem for the tank. or when using weapons<br/>\nAnthem, Elemental, Binding, Lull.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the main rule is never ever ever let any fire goblin get behind you,<br/>\nthey all (er, pretty sure all) backstab huge. Keep your back to the wall at<br/>\nall times. You can&#39;t always help that while pulling, so make sure you are<br/>\ngoing to have a heal waiting for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
