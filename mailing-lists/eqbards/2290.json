After two nights<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; grouping with a friend to kill the hermit in SK (he&#39;s around lvl 21-23 I<br/>\n&gt; think, and is at -5411, -2646), I now have enough to buy a Dirk (just<br/>\n&gt; shelled out 50pp on banded so I&#39;m rebuilding my funds).  Speaking of Ye<br/>\nOlde<br/>\n&gt; Hermit, he gives out a cracked flute and the first sheet of the WInds of<br/>\n&gt; Karana (to give to the bard at the water fountain in SK), does anyone know<br/>\n&gt; if this quest works, or where the other sheet(s) are?<br/>\n&gt;     Also, is any particular instrument better than any other?
