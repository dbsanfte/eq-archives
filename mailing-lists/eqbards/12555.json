They are all L50,<br/>\n  and have the best stuff in the game.  They know exactly what to do with<br/>\n  less than 25 people.  For that, I respect them.  But that&#39;s about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All other guilds who have attempted Vox have failed, and failed<br/>\n  badly.  From what I understand you have to have to right people.<br/>\n  Since the pool of available people is large on most servers, why<br/>\n  in the world would you pick a knowledgable lower level person over <br/>\n  a knowledgable higher level one?
