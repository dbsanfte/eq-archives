Our effects (not that I&#39;m likely to get the<br/>\nitems) are parlor tricks compared to what the other plate wearing classes<br/>\nget.  Our armor&#39;s AC is lower than all the other plate wearing classes and<br/>\neven lower than the ranger armor.  How does this make any kind of balance<br/>\nsense?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to figure out where they got the idea that we would have a<br/>\nuse for Enduring Breath (we have the spell and are guaranteed never to be<br/>\nout of the radius) and Summon drink (we are one of only 3 classes to get<br/>\nforage).  It&#39;s bizarre.  Seems to me like another case of:<br/>\nQuestion: \t&quot;We have no idea what effect to put on Bard armor&quot;<br/>\nAnswer: \t&quot;Hmmm, me neither, hey that fishbone earring is popular,<br/>\ngive them<br/>\n\t\tEnduring Breath, and Summon Water goes well with that theme&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tback to being annoyed I guess<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the boots and gloves<br/>\nis so powerful that they made the AC lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When these items started dropping they had the same AC and no effect at<br/>\nall.<br/>\n2) How is Enduring Breath and Summon Drink better so much better than Fury,<br/>\nSnare, Cancel Magic (just some of the effects I&#39;ve seen on other class<br/>\nspecific items) that is requires a lower AC than Rangers who can&#39;t even wear<br/>\nplate?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least if we accidentally summon way too much water, we have enduring<br/>\nbreath so we won&#39;t drown.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to look on the bright side,<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 52 Minstrel of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
