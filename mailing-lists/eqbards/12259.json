I took out a judicator in Cazic-Thule the other day solo and it<br/>\nnever got a single heal off, 5 clean interrupts and then it died. I<br/>\nthink the only cleric more difficult in Cazic is the Cenobite, and I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t lay odds on him stacking up 1 on 1 well against a 50 Bard<br/>\neither.
