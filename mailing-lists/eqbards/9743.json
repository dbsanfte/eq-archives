He said<br/>\nthey were uncertain whether they would extend the cap to 60 - and give new<br/>\nskills, abilities, with each level -or- extend it to level 75 and break-up<br/>\nthe enhancments (I personally think they should go to level 75).  He also<br/>\nhinted at the idea of classes being able to borrow certain skills and<br/>\nabilities from other classes (like being able to bind, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s going to be weird when the expansion comes... it will be interesting to<br/>\nsee how they handle it.  Obviously, a lot of combat related stats are going<br/>\nto have to be tweeked.  With the current caps, there is no way that a group<br/>\ncould tackle a level 75 MOB (our dodge skill is going to be sooooo pathetic<br/>\nin awhile - unless it gets raised).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 31 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
