The clerics who were not quite believers in the Bard Hate idea,<br/>\nwerent prepared, and werent monitoring me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMob hate is also apparent in Blackburrow to some extent, my first Bard I<br/>\ndidnt know any different , I later took another class in and was amazed at<br/>\nhow much easier it was, and how little I got trained.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut by far the worst experience Ive seen, to the point of laughability was<br/>\nin Splitpaw. When I was 9-10th level I went in with a full group of 6, with<br/>\n2 tanks, a cleric, a shaman, a caster and myself.<br/>\nEVERY pull , every wandering Mob, Everything ignored the tanks the casters<br/>\nand made a beeline to me, I was very upset, the others couldnt believe it.<br/>\nIt got to the point that they couldnt effectively hunt because they were too<br/>\nbusy trying to take mobs off of me and keep me alive.  I eventually left<br/>\nbecause I felt like i was kinda holding them back.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Andy Simpson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gohorns@...\">gohorns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, July 05, 1999 8:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bards and Mob Hate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Andy Simpson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gohorns@...\">gohorns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the mobs in Unrest just hate us.
