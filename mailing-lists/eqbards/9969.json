The<br/>\nproblem (like most grouping  problems) are usually the worst in &quot;pick-up<br/>\ngroups&quot; and nonexistent in regular and guild groups.  Otherwise most systems<br/>\nwork pretty well.  When doing FFA&#39;s I tell people to count five corpses then<br/>\nloot the sixth one (assuming a six-member party).  With &quot;honorable&quot; people<br/>\nit works pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\n    What galls me the most are the rash of characters named &quot;Aaaba&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Aaada&quot; (the three a&#39;s is NOT a typo here).  Obviously these character names<br/>\nwere decided purely to go first in alpha loot.  With a character name<br/>\nstarting with &quot;S&quot; I&#39;m usually one of the last to loot.  Even in &quot;honorable&quot;<br/>\ngroups - when we do the 5pp or item loot - I often don&#39;t get my turn.<br/>\nHowever - I usually am with my guildmates who will split their share with me<br/>\nin those cases - often even when I don&#39;t ask!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
