One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had been using<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.

The tower in the<br/>\nundead part of Lower Guk is well known for this. As to whether it&#39;s<br/>\nbeing worked on, as it&#39;s been bugged it&#39;s probably on their todo list<br/>\nbut the only indication we ever get as to whether they are actually<br/>\nworking on it is when announcements show up in the test server patch<br/>\nnotes that they think they have fixed it. I guess they feel that<br/>\npublishing a list of known bugs with the priority of the bug fix would<br/>\nnot be to thier benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
