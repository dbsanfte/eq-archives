They&#39;re placeholders for eachother<br/>\ndepending on who you&#39;re hunting.  *smirk*  I believe other named spawns<br/>\nare in that same set too.  All hearsay tho as I&#39;ve never done it<br/>\nmyself, just watched key hunts from over a shoulder.  More word of<br/>\nmouth is the Mask of Obtenebration (erudite mask) is from Howling<br/>\nStones off of Venril Sathir&#39;s counterpart there, the one you lose<br/>\nfaction with.  I&#39;ve seen one in action once and may I say, I think<br/>\nerudites (females at least) look damn goofy in full lambent.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Rudeflute<br/>\n35th, yes.. still 35th a month later<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
