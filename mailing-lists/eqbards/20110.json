Our enchanter cast aoe stun when we were killing fairies on<br/>\nthe first island of Sky and got almost every quest mob from the inside<br/>\nof the island on his butt instantly. I think the only factor that has<br/>\nany effect is if mobs are below you in the dungeon or not. Some places<br/>\nthat seem ok may just not intersect with other mob holding areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant (Brad) has said at least one place that I&#39;ve seen that checking<br/>\nthe z-axis is just something they can&#39;t do in the current server engine.<br/>\nToo much cpu. Given that I&#39;m 99% certain the game runs on Sun servers<br/>\nand if it was spec&#39;d when they started developing, the servers it was<br/>\nspec&#39;d for aren&#39;t even sold anymore, I really think they probably could<br/>\nhave the cpu for it now if they really wanted to do it but that&#39;s what<br/>\nhe has said.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy am I 99% certain it&#39;s running on Sun? Look at Verant&#39;s current job<br/>\nofferings. The Sr. Sysadmin position says your duties involve <br/>\n&quot;Configure, deploy and maintain game server hardware to power our<br/>\nMassively Multiplayer games&quot; While Unix experience is required, NT<br/>\nexperience is only prefered. As a side note, from what I&#39;ve heard they<br/>\npay, getting a sysadmin with a Cisco ticket is a total fantasy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
