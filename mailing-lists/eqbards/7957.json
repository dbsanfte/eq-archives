Every caster<br/>\n&gt; class gets at least 1 option to avoiding engagements on corpse retrieval,<br/>\n&gt; many get 2.  One is invis, the other is root.  Yes, some classes don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; these spells until lvl 9 or 16 or so, but that&#39;s not really the point.<br/>\n&gt; The difference between the various melee classes and the various caster<br/>\n&gt; classes don&#39;t really begin to show themselves until around this time<br/>\n&gt; anyways.  If one tries to argue that a melee class can get to their corpse<br/>\n&gt; easier than a caster because a level 1 warrior has more hp than a level 1<br/>\n&gt; wizard, that argument is completely invalid when discussing the two<br/>\n&gt; classes as a whole.<br/>\n&gt; Given that one (repeatedly suggested) option is for melee-types to keep spare <br/>\n </span></blockquote>weapons/armor in the bank (a reasonably significant cash investment, especially early <br/>\non), there is one other way in which ALL caster classes can protect themselves from a <br/>\nvery early level:  their PET.  Yes, it has a component cost and yes, it would need to <br/>\nbe cast in every (dangerous) region, but it is like having your own sacrificial lackey <br/>\naround to take attackers off of you.  If your only purpose is to get away, any <br/>\nattacking monster will shift its attention to the pet almost as soon as the pet starts <br/>\nhitting it, giving you a free and unimpeded run.  If you&#39;re lucky, you might even get <br/>\nexp for it.  I don&#39;t see melee types getting a free tank in order to save their own <br/>\ntushies.  I&#39;ve used this method to great advantage with my Enchantress.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
