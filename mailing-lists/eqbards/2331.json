So you could be standing there and sing it over and <br/>\nover again.  I can hold a blue critter in place indefinately without taking <br/>\nany damage.  For charm song, you have to wait until the charm wears off and <br/>\nif you time it right, you maybe able to recharm it before it throws the <br/>\nfirst punch at you.  It requires really good timing and hope that the <br/>\ncritter does not resist your charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso for the charm song, once it was charm, it will FIX on you when he wakes <br/>\nup.  Almost nothing can pull him off you.  As for pixie, it doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\ncare who put it to sleep, when it wakes up, it just attacks whoever was <br/>\nhitting it or whoever he was hitting when he was put to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now Pixie Strike (formerly pixie chase) might work for that. It seems to<br/>\n&gt;be sort of a targetted lullaby, but the few times I&#39;ve used it I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;noticed if it cleared the hate list, in fact it didn&#39;t seem to be all<br/>\n&gt;that useful at all. The few times it worked it kept one mob standing<br/>\n&gt;around for about 10 seconds. If that&#39;s all it does, I dont see why you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;use it instead of charm, which basically does the same thing with the<br/>\n&gt;added bonus that you can have the mob attack it&#39;s friends for those 10<br/>\n&gt;seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone found some use for Pixie Strike I may have missed?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt;Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
