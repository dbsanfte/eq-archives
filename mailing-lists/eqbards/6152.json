I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hatar is a spawn so rare, I, and most people I know, have never seen<br/>\n&gt; him. He spawns in either Oasis or S Ro (so I&#39;ve heard) and I used to<br/>\n&gt; check tracking every time I passed through there. I even auctioned that<br/>\n&gt; I would pay 100 plat for a tell from someone when he was sighted and<br/>\n&gt; never once got a message. I lucked out and got one from someone who did<br/>\n&gt; stumble across him, and I traded a serpantine bracer for it. I&#39;ve only<br/>\n&gt; run across 3 of them on Tarrew Marr, counting the one I have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; Drawing is held each week through September 17.
