Can anyone give me any advice<br/>\non how best to approach this mob and his surrounding friends? I know there are 4 CWG&#39;s around and<br/>\neither a 5th wanderer or the Lava Elemental. But I have seen nothing on the web of how to approach<br/>\nhim. And few people I have spoken with seem to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group will be:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard (me) Level 29 or 30, depending how much I get to play, but lately the Steel Golem area in Cazic<br/>\nhas been a level every 4-5 hours. :-)..<br/>\nTroll Shaman Level 41 and Pet.<br/>\nTroll SK Level 40<br/>\nOgre Warrior Level 34<br/>\nHafling Druid Level 31.<br/>\nMaybe another Cleric if they can make it. Only level 26 though or anyone else we can pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions I have:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Can I lull pull to get 1 or 2 at a time? I have never killed a CWG or a gnome but the evils have.<br/>\n2. Will I be able to stun the mobs or do I need another couple of levels?<br/>\n3. I know the CWG&#39;s are very resistant to Magic and mostly melee but can they be charmed?<br/>\n4. Can this group take and hold the room?<br/>\n5. Any other advice? My spell selection will probably be Psalm, Hym, Charm, Pixie, Anthem or Chant,<br/>\nLullaby, Lull, and Group invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would rather send it to my home email feel free as I am asking for some spoiler advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanian Aeleroth</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
