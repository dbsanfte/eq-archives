Each gem has a specific  <br/>\n     magical effect. (plus str, plus ac and magic resist, pus str and dex  <br/>\n     for example)  This gem can be combined with 4 different types of  <br/>\n     enchanted metal for increasing effect.  silver, electrum, gold and  <br/>\n     platinum in order of strength.  Thus a cat&#39;s eye gem combined with  <br/>\n     gold is better then the same gem with electrum  (7 vrs 4) This is a  <br/>\n     VERY expensive trade to work your skill up in and most jewelers are  <br/>\n     only doing gold and that with about half the gems.  The more powerful  <br/>\n     the gem the higher skill level that is needed.  I have yet to see any  <br/>\n     platinum made jewelry.  Each plat bar costs 110pp and your probably  <br/>\n     familiar with how many failures it takes to build up your skill at any  <br/>\n     trade.  A failure destroys the metal and gem...  (lets see, a platinum  <br/>\n     bar (110) and a ruby(120) ooops failure,  thats 230pp down the drain)<br/>\n      <br/>\n     So gold jewelry is better then electrum with the same gem.  To make it  <br/>\n     even more confusing the type of item changes depending on the metal.   <br/>\n     A certain gem combined with silver may be an earring but with gold a  <br/>\n     necklace.  There is no hard rule for the level of bonus but this is a  <br/>\n     ROUGH guide  <br/>\n      <br/>\n     Metal     stat Plus    hp/mp plus<br/>\n     silver      2-3           5<br/>\n     electrum    3-5           10<br/>\n     gold        4-7           15-20<br/>\n     platinum    5-?           20-35<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Better gems may have more then one effect.<br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n     If you ever get a black pearl or a diamond as loot DON&#39;T sell them!<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Save them till you find a good jeweler and commission him/her to make  <br/>\n     jewelry for you.  Those two gems are tops as far as I can tell and are  <br/>\n     only available as loot.  Most gems can be bought from vendors but not  <br/>\n     the very best ones.  Black pearls add to both str and dex and diamonds  <br/>\n     add to 4 different things!   <br/>\n      <br/>\n     There are many web sites with this info but I though I&#39;d give you all  <br/>\n     a quick refresher.<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Bujold<br/>\n     19th level (stuck here forever it seems)<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Charisma boosting items (possible spoilers)<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-lordartos (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    8/19/99 6:02 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\nAbout the bracelets, you said you have electrum cat&#39;s  <br/>\neye, which is funny because mine are golden cat&#39;s eye,  <br/>\nbut they are +7 each.
