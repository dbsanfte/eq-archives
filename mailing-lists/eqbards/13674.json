I stated that Verant&#39;s main<br/>\nfocus should be on fixing what is broke in the game and then adding new<br/>\nquests/items for all levels 1-50.  This benefits everyone and is a<br/>\nlegitimate problem.  Just because you don&#39;t agree with me doesn&#39;t it isn&#39;t<br/>\nlegitimate.  Your only concern is overcrowding for level 50 players.  Fixing<br/>\nthis benefits only a select group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis issue be easily settled if Verant would conduct a poll when you log in.<br/>\nI&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t use that capability more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (surprised this thread hasn&#39;t been kabonged yet)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Either way the prohblem of the matter is you have people complaining over<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; legititment problem and then you have people complaining they never get<br/>\n&gt; something new. So I&#39;ll put this simple see the diffrence? See who deserves<br/>\n&gt; the change?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
