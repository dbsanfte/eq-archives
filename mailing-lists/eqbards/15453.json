If<br/>\nVerant hopped the clue train and made the rolls appear in yellow or red<br/>\nthere&#39;d be no way to cheat.  As it is, emotes and rolls are the same color.<br/>\nDuh.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheetr creates an emote that produces the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nCheetr says &#39;Blah, blah...  I hope I win.&#39;_______<br/>\nCheetr could have rolled any number from 1 to 100<br/>\nbut this time he made sure it was a 98.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust make double sure that NO ONE in a roll has &quot;said&quot; anything prior to the<br/>\nroll itself.  If anyone has, reroll, perhaps using the method below:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe leader of the group randoms a number 1 to 100 and then the group rolls<br/>\nto that.  That way no one can use the emote cheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeader rolls 1 to 100 and gets a 43.<br/>\nEveryone else does a /random 1 43 for the winner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the 1-6 Alpha method is that if the leader and someone in<br/>\nthe group are wooking in cahoots, the randomer could make sure his buddy won<br/>\nthe roll for the item that he really wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n[47 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One way I&#39;ve heard of people cheating is to use the space wrap trick.<br/>\n&gt; You could type something. i.e.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never win these things&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;lots of spaces until your  text<br/>\n&gt; wraps to the next line&gt; then<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blah has rolled...... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
