When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>\n&gt; right away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>\n&gt; few levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out for<br/>\n&gt; help.  I had to run to the zone with Croon and Froon chasing me but he got<br/>\n&gt; his corpse.  After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n&gt; That is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; I have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>\n&gt; depending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; invite them and speed them up for no charge.
