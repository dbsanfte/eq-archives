He was first complaining<br/>\nabout being bored.  Twisting Cantata in during combat and singing it in downtime, he wasn&#39;t getting to<br/>\nheal anybody.  (Rogues rock).  Then he realized that he could nuke.  Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 55 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I love the fix they did to mez.  I had a four person group in Seb tonight that handled 7 frogs (five<br/>\ninitial, two adds) with no Enchanter and no Cleric.  Mez seems to last a little longer than the normal<br/>\nsong, I can sing a full five during a twist, which lets me control 3-4 things with 1-2 resists.

The health regen is quite<br/>\n&gt; impressive when I am singing the lvl 55 cantana with the 7 string lute in<br/>\n&gt; hand during downtime, especially if another group regen spell is active on<br/>\n&gt; the party.
