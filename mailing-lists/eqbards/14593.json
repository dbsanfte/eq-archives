I&#39;m saying you cannot squeeze that many more people into<br/>\n  one fight.  They are making it so you need more and more people to<br/>\n  do certain things.  And it will come to a point where you bring so<br/>\n  many people who are needed to do a dragon, that they all will go<br/>\n  linkdead.  Verant cannot keep upping the dragons like this, next<br/>\n  thing you know the dragons will be shouting out people&#39;s names.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you bring 24 elite L50s to a dragon fight in full planar armor<br/>\n  and resist gear, you had damn well better win.  Verant completely<br/>\n  plays down the fact that L50s are the highest and most experienced<br/>\n  players in the world.  I should be like Bard from the Hobbit.  <br/>\n  Oops, I don&#39;t get Archery... nm.  heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leveling people.  To be honest all the high levels being bored is<br/>\n&gt; speeding my level progress right now, as they are often around to help<br/>\n&gt; me when I do something stupid (like die deep in Befallen) and they (at<br/>\n&gt; least for me) are often genrorous with equipment...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  It seems that&#39;s all I&#39;ve been really doing lately in my spare time.<br/>\n  Helping out people.  Handing out bronze and money.  Doing quests <br/>\n  for people who are less fortunate.  Can&#39;t really buff people, but<br/>\n  I can hang around and make sure the little peeps are doing ok.<br/>\n  I&#39;ll camp permafrost and grab some coronets and pass them out to<br/>\n  monks, or some axes/blades to younger bards who show great prospect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the items to make Lambent Gauntlets, anyone here need them<br/>\n  on Innoruuk?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
