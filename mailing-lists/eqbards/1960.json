There are some nasties to look out for...Basically anything that comes out of the castle is nasty.... <br/>\n<br/>\nEmperor Crush - The dude that runs the whole show. If you take him down, you get a real nice piece of small magical ringmail...<br/>\nRoyal Guard - A orc ROGUE if you believe it...I do, because his backstab is brutal<br/>\nLord Darish - Haven&#39;t met up with him often (Even as my level 15 Warrior alter ego) Not sure what good he is...<br/>\nThe Prophet - An oracle on steroids...<br/>\nEmisarry - The orc with a mission...To whack you over and over and over with his spear. Really, he&#39;s quite good at his job...<br/>\nAmbassador D&#39;vinn - Dark Elf with an attitude. This is THE bad guy of the whole area. Not sure what level he is, but it usually takes a group to nuke him. Awesome dagger (Dragoon Dirk) to be found when he falls though (Hint: If you&#39;re not on his hate list, don&#39;t attack orcs near him...He might ignore you if you&#39;re not fighting!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two are found elsewhere and are of note, because they can get hard to kill at lower levels...<br/>\n<br/>\nTrainer - Found WAY on top of the hill overlooking the castle. People camp this area heavily because he will drop a Shiny Brass Shield (AC10, +10vsMagic, Lightstone)<br/>\nTaskmaster - Slaver Boss. Has a nice leather whip to reach out and touch someone with...Actually found behind the castle.<br/>\nRondo - Dwarven Bandit found in the mines. He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good reason to ice him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the crew to be found around (in order from easiest to kill to hardest to kill IMO) are Pawns, Centurion, Oracles, Slavers, and Legionnaires. At your level, this will pretty much be the meat of your hunting. If you are soloing, don&#39;t even step foot on the island that has the castle unless you&#39;ve got your drums at the ready. My piece of advice...Learn where the Legionnaire&#39;s spawn and avoid (unless you can take a Legionnaire) and avoid the mine unless you&#39;re with a group, or there is already one camped inside. Occasionally if you kill a slaver, they drop keys. Use these keys to gain the appreciation of the slaves scattered around the area. If you give a slave a copper piece, he will read the number of his shackles so you can match the keys up....<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\n9th Rank, Kelethin Branch<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Michal Hobson <br/>\n  To: EQBards <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 15, 1999 18:27<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] What a beautiful day!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hail and well met friends in song!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just had the most righteous day of adventuring.  Using my newly acquired Kelin&#39;s I gained over half a level towards 11 in just under 3 hours!!!<br/>\n  This may seem small to some but when I remember that it took me 2 weeks to get from 7 to 8 it makes me jump for joy.  We camped derv&#39;s and orcs all day in E. and W. Commons.  Rather exciting!!!  Anyway just letting my joy sound out!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Keep up the helpful posting here bards.  It is a true godsend.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Weiland of Freeport<br/>\n  Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S.  Where is a good loot grabbing spot for lvl&#39;s 10 and 11.  These songs are getting expensive and its getting to be time for an armor upgrade.<br/>\n  Seems like the loot was dry today.  Even at the derv camp. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
