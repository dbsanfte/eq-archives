We&#39;ve beaten<br/>\nMaestro with the same group many times, so we thought no problem (24 of us<br/>\nat the time, we normally fight with 18 and get a couple more during the<br/>\nnight).  Our monk pulls great in this zone and can get Maestro single even<br/>\nwhen his room is full.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe thought it was a fluke, so we tried again and got spanked again.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot even sure what went wrong the first two times, although we talked about<br/>\nit and it seems that the clerics didn&#39;t use stun all that often.  Stunning<br/>\nthis sucker helps a lot, but even then we couldn&#39;t explain how badly we got<br/>\nowned.  So we made sure one of the clerics inthe 2cleric groups was chain<br/>\nstunning.  Still didn&#39;t help, although this time it was close.  Then we<br/>\nthought it was because he was duel wielding that gave him such an edge,<br/>\nsince we had recently gotten owned by Cazic when he was duel wielding a a<br/>\nbloodmoon (whatever the warrior only weapon is) and a Soul Leach.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe think it had much more to do with the group balance than anything else,<br/>\nand maybe group size.  We had 24, fairly unbalanced groups (no wizards, no<br/>\nnecros, no druids, 1 mage, 2 shaman, 9 warriors, 6 clerics, 2 enchanters,<br/>\none pally, one rogue, one monk, and one &lt;very happy at the end of the<br/>\nnight&gt; bard).  We brought up 2 wizzies, a necro, an SK, and 2 clerics, and<br/>\nhe died pretty quick the 4th time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nHmm,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild went to PoH Friday night.  By 4am, we had cleared everything (110+<br/>\nkills) and had the maestro all alone.  There were about 25 of us and we<br/>\ntook<br/>\nhim without any problems.  One clearing pull that agro&#39;d an outside patrol<br/>\ngroup smooshed us lots harder than he did.  Our pullers brought his guards<br/>\n2<br/>\nat a time and we did them before hitting him.  He was definitely a red to<br/>\n50<br/>\nmob but did not seem as tough as Naggy or Vox.  It has been nearly 10<br/>\nlevels<br/>\nsince I have see the dragons so I hope you are right.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
