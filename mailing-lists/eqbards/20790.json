At any rate, I went to the Field of Bone at 8,<br/>\nbringing only my level 9 song, surely I would die before 10 and could grab<br/>\nAnthem from my bankbox in Firiona Vie then. Well, I did have to make a trip<br/>\nback to Kelethin to train dodge, but I am now level 11 and have yet to die.<br/>\nField of bone is great, highly recommended for 9-12. Hunt the area between<br/>\nthe Swamp zone and the pit for 8 and 9, the pit itself for 10-11. <br/>\nI have also been taking the oportunity to sing some Iksar folks songs in<br/>\n/shout, to mixed reviews, they are not a very musical race (they attribute<br/>\nthis to having no ears). Here are a few I have found so far:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s what makes you not a mammal<br/>\nThat makes you dear to me<br/>\nYour color patches are my favorite fun<br/>\nWhen your flashing red and yellow<br/>\nFor all the world to see<br/>\nMy heart starts beating like I&#39;m layin<br/>\non a hot rock in the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother:<br/>\n<br/>\nYour lips are soft,so soft my love, <br/>\nit&#39;s almost as if you are molting<br/>\nMy battle scars, and slight fungus collection<br/>\nmust surely leave you shy unto bolting<br/>\nBut you caught my eye e&#39;en before you grew limbs<br/>\nand I set out to win you or die<br/>\nAnd I built you this nest, and just look at these grubs!<br/>\nOh please wag your tail or I&#39;ll cry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
