Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have a dirk, whip and tomahawk, I would say ditch the whip and use the<br/>\ntomahawk and the dirk, as the whip isn&#39;t a very good weapon, damage ratio wise.<br/>\nThe effect is nice, but it doesn&#39;t proc enough to make up for the general<br/>\nweakness of the weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of which weapon should go in which hand, in terms of pure damage, the<br/>\ndirk should go in your primary hand, and the tomahawk in your other.  If you are<br/>\ntanking though, reverse this, as the tomahawk will proc more often in your<br/>\nprimary hand, and you want that sweet magic skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
