There<br/>\nare 2 spawns just around the corner, 3 on the next island (although 1 is<br/>\nalways green) and 3 more in the Nokta room to the left of the island coming<br/>\nfrom the zone line. (There are 3-4 more down the right hand tunnel but a<br/>\nbroken LoS causes problems with breaking the spawn.) I got through 35, 36,<br/>\nand 37 solo here Lamenting them and pulling to the zone line. At 37 I could<br/>\nrotate through all 8 for about half a bubble of experience I think. Spawn<br/>\ntime on each of em is about 16-17 minits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 6:08 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Don&#39;t laugh at this question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 24 Feb 2000, Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Was wondering if there is a good place for me to solo at 35th level?<br/>\nSpent<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could try Lower Guk, live side, near the zone.
