Many things seem to go for hours (days?) without every<br/>\ntriggering; then the RNG goes nuts and pops many many times in a row.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nhad two people so far claim it was &quot;easy to get&quot; and three (counting me)<br/>\nreporting it difficult.  My good friend Darkfox who&#39;s on my server and this<br/>\nlist has also reported it&#39;s a &quot;Semi-Rare&quot; spawn...<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent about four hours there.  Hooked up with a group 50-55 who were after<br/>\nthe named guy at the Church to get a fang for a quest for a key to get into<br/>\nHowling Stones and to explore the zone.  They cleared the library - no<br/>\nfailed raider - no coin.  They had moved on by the time I got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after I joined them - another group came in to camp the library.<br/>\nThey were there a good three hours (by the time I moved on) maybe longer.<br/>\nUnless they were bullshitting me (which I doubt) - they didn&#39;t get a single<br/>\nFailed Raider - and nothing else dropped the coin.  They had a bard in their<br/>\ngroup - so I was hoping they&#39;d get two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt they were bullshitting.  If they did get a bunch and were hoarding<br/>\nthem for various reasons; they fairly got the room while my group was<br/>\ncamping elsewhere - why would they lie?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know the rules of random sampling - a 2 hour sample of a 30 minute<br/>\nspawn is 4 samples - you got a 50 pct hit.  Another group got six tried and<br/>\n0 pct hit... (Plus my groups sample - they cleared the room only once<br/>\nthough)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n43 Bard of Xegony<br/>\nStill Needing his Kaesora Coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 9:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: MM Drum misadventure and Nostrolo Tamborine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;cough&gt;bullshit&lt;cough&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKaesora is virtually deserted on Inny. Like I posted, been there 2 times<br/>\nnow.  First time, cleared into the Library and presto there was the coin<br/>\nguy.  Second time, cleared library, no coin, cleared the other stuff in the<br/>\narea, library re-spawned and we got the coin guy.  Less than 2 hours.  Might<br/>\nhave been the 3rd time to clear the Library but seems to be a fast 30 min<br/>\ntimer in that zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
