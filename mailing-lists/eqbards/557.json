Also, I have recieved tips, though<br/>\nrarely, most I think was 5pp once.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is nothing wrong with setting up a &quot;business,&quot; as was the original<br/>\nidea.  If I am a bard and I make it a point to be at the Kaladim<br/>\ndock -every- time the ship rolls in, roughly every 14 hours, I am not going<br/>\nto the trouble to do this out of charity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost high level characters have reams of pp to spare, let alone 5gp.  One<br/>\nbard hauling enough people for such a low fare could make a good venture of<br/>\nit.  Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s greedy or anything else, he made an effort to be<br/>\nthere, he should expect compensation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise if a bard set up a service between Freeport and Qeynos, and did<br/>\nnothing but make the trip back and forth, what do it for free?  I say no, go<br/>\nahead and charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow helping someone out if you&#39;re headed that direction, or bored and want<br/>\nto explore, this is an entirely different matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;NeXuS&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nexus@...\">nexus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I always tell people that I work on Doanations or offerings. I have never<br/>\n&gt;said I will cjharge 1 pp etcc because I had seen a friend say that and once<br/>\n&gt;he got the fare to his corpse he just left and did not even pay for it. If<br/>\n&gt;you make the other person feel that you are helping from the kindness of<br/>\n&gt;your heart they feel compeled to help you in turn.

When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>\n&gt;&gt; right away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>\n&gt;&gt; few levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; help.

After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from<br/>\n&gt;him.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>\n&gt;&gt; depending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But<br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I<br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; invite them and speed them up for no charge.
