Berserker + BoC 20 delay. *and yes, boggle*<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I won&#39;t be able to get my hands on my FBSS anytime soon. If anyone<br/>\nout there with one would care to do the same tests, that would be nice.<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty certain the same results will show with any other haste item.<br/>\nSo its either some kind of bug, or simply how its designed.<br/>\nHowever, if it were just limited to the BoC, that wouldn&#39;t mean a whole<br/>\nlot anyways. There will never be level 10 bards with &#39;em to take full<br/>\nadvantage of it and sing Anthem with it, but oh well. Interesting none<br/>\nthe less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings up a gripe, we have a song for expansion that I believe was<br/>\nposted as +45% attack speed with no stats. Thats utterly useless, much<br/>\nlike SLTW is if you already have a haste item. Perhaps we can get it<br/>\naltered?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
