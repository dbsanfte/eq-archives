I&#39;ve got a ykesha for my<br/>\n&gt; primary, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m willing to do that camp again for a while.<br/>\n&gt; The ebw seems like a good choice for a secondary weapon anyway since its<br/>\n&gt; faster than the ykesha, and off hand proc&#39;s never seem to happen much for<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, not having a whole lot of experience with MM, I know how to get to<br/>\n&gt; the maid and butler rooms, but I&#39;m not really very familiar with spawns<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; aggro radius&#39; in there, I was just wondering if anyone can offer any<br/>\n&gt; advice.<br/>\n&gt; Where is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or should I<br/>\n&gt; bring<br/>\n&gt; along anyone else?  About how long does it take on average to get both<br/>\n&gt; fangs?<br/>\n&gt; Any advice would be helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt; Level 50 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
