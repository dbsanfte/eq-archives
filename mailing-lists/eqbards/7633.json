A few of the suggestions<br/>\nwere bard related.  Some of the issues the guy suggested are already covered<br/>\nin the letter to GZ that Elwyn has written.  One suggestion wasn&#39;t and bears<br/>\nconsideration for inclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writer suggested making the radius of Selos, Invis song, and Underwater<br/>\nbreathing song zone-wide versus a short radius centered around the bard.<br/>\nThe reason being that it is potentially very dangerous for the bards&#39; group<br/>\nmembers if they move outside the radius of the song, especially the levitate<br/>\nsong.  I don&#39;t think asking that Verant to change these songs to affect the<br/>\nentire zone has much chance of ever succedding.  However, asking them to<br/>\nincrease the radius of levitate and underwater breathing is definately<br/>\nsomething that would make life easier on our group members and therefore<br/>\nhave a higher chance of getting improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t think this would be a class balance issue because it does absolutely<br/>\nnothing to improve the combat/survivability capabilities of the bard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
