Also, how<br/>\nmuch more do we incur if we are chose not to be a human?  In other words,<br/>\nwhat are the percentage hits for the following:<br/>\n   1) Human Bard<br/>\n   2) Woodelf Bard<br/>\n   3) Human Warrior - just as a comparison (I&#39;m assuming that this race and<br/>\nclass would incur no penalties.  So the other items (1 and 2) would be a<br/>\npercentage increase form this race/class, i.e. A human Bard would require<br/>\nXX% more experience to level when compared to a human warrior).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n Steve</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
