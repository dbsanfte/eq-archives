I don&#39;t want all our songs<br/>\nmana-based.  It doesn&#39;t fit how bards work.  I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t like the<br/>\nsong ideas and think our new songs will be as good as they should be, I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to rely on mana to be able to do sing them.  I think Dirge should<br/>\nhave had a timer reset like LH, HT, or DA instead of using our mana.  When<br/>\nthey implemented the song, GZ said he only used mana to limit how often we<br/>\nused it.  It was not really a mana-based song, they just used mana as a<br/>\ntimer instead of doing it the right way (couldn&#39;t they keep the song slot<br/>\ngrayed out like divine aura until they wanted us to use it again?).  And if<br/>\nthey did that right, we wouldn&#39;t even be talking about songs using mana<br/>\nright now cause it never would have happened and we never would have thought<br/>\nof it.

Needless to say the song is a waste.  It requires<br/>\n&gt;   mana, but for the wrong reason. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
