When I did my fang first I was<br/>\nplaying my level 52 wizard.  I was dubious to Xalgoz but he talked to me<br/>\nand gave me the quest.  So I turned in my parts and he said he would not<br/>\naid beings like me.  I got a GM to restore my parts since Durgoz actually<br/>\ndid give me the quest text.<br/>\nI then brought a 49th Enchanter along with me to charm him.  Even though<br/>\nDurgoz was green to the both of us he resisted the charm, started attacking<br/>\nthe enchanter.  Resisted every root that I attempted to cast on him.  I<br/>\nkilled his pet.  He resisted every nuke I put on him, continued to resist<br/>\ncharm and mez from the enchanter.<br/>\nThe fight ended when both the enchanter and I found ourselves on the other<br/>\nside of the zone line, quite beat up and licking our wounds.  All we manage<br/>\nto do was to kill his pet.  I&#39;m sure he is probably killable with melee<br/>\nmethods but don&#39;t try that charm stuff on him, he dosen&#39;t like it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
