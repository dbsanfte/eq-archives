That s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know (including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-516501820\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Well, this is were the grouping aspects of EQ take over.  Yes we have songs <br/>\n&gt; that lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which is <br/>\n&gt; why my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>\n&gt; &lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want to go <br/>\n&gt; into the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they are <br/>\n&gt; so easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do not <br/>\n&gt; get a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they are <br/>\n&gt; difficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to group <br/>\n&gt; in the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the <br/>\n&gt; game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>\n(including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>\nHowever, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>\nlevels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>\nyour other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>\nYes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>\nhard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>\n&quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>\nthat&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted. <br/>\n<br/>\nKind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>\ndoes damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>\nthe extra 40% resists..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
