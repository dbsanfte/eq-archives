Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 14, 2000 6:45 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] I posted this to the Everwhatever boards and to<br/>\nthe Concert Hall<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking the mez songs require an instrument isn&#39;t enough.  They&#39;re mez songs,<br/>\nso it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going<br/>\nto be attacking anything anyway, which is the only thing that requiring an<br/>\ninstrument prevents us from<br/>\ndoing.  The problem is that Verant believes that the AE mez effect is too<br/>\npowerful.  I don&#39;t know if they<br/>\nfeel it can be exploited (they seem to be incredibly hung up on the &quot;no<br/>\nmana&quot; thing), or if this is just a<br/>\nclass balance thing between Bards and Enchanters, but they aren&#39;t going to<br/>\nfix AE mez.  It will never<br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s disturbing to me are three things:<br/>\n1.  Their testing indicates that the resists are lower than any of our<br/>\ntesting indicates, which suggests<br/>\nthat:  a) they&#39;re lousy testers or b) they have a different client or c)<br/>\nwe&#39;re all idiots.  Their<br/>\nconclusion, of course, is going to be c), which means that they&#39;re going to<br/>\nbe pretty dismissive of<br/>\nanything we say.<br/>\n2.  They slapped the SAME secondary resist rate that they used to neuter the<br/>\nAE mez song onto the single<br/>\ntarget songs.  They seem to believe that this hasty, ill-thought-out<br/>\ndecision is pretty much fine, which<br/>\nsuggests a serious deficiency in their ability to balance Bard songs<br/>\nappropriately (as if that isn&#39;t<br/>\nobvious by now).<br/>\n3.  They&#39;ve been promising for a month now to look into the single-target<br/>\nmez songs at the first possible<br/>\nopportunity, and even at that level of priority have not managed to get<br/>\naround to it.  Abashi&#39;s post<br/>\nsuggests that they&#39;ve significantly lowered the priority level of this<br/>\ntesting, which means it is likely<br/>\nto be a cold day in you-know-where before they get around to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 53 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here is a constructive idea that would likely make most bards happier,<br/>\n&gt; return these songs to a being a viable option, and maintain Enchanters<br/>\n&gt; current position with respect to crowd control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Make the songs in question require an instrument much the way that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sonorous<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Clouding currently does.
