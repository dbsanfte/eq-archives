(I apologize<br/>\n&gt;      if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most<br/>\n&gt;      interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must<br/>\n&gt;      say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.<br/>\n&gt;      (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Welcome to the list! I too was surprised that (currently) there are no <br/>\nflames going on and it seems everyone is getting along fine - no complaints <br/>\nhere!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area<br/>\n&gt;      effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a <br/>\n&gt;step<br/>\n&gt;      by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>\n&gt;      of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m waiting for the answer to this myself =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;      (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am<br/>\n&gt;      rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a<br/>\n&gt;      goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Bujold (Xegony) (look no e.. :))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on where you currently are hanging out. I was mostly in Beholder <br/>\naround that level with a group. Hunting minos for their axes and a horn (for <br/>\nlater use). Also spent quite a bit of time in the North Ro desert. If you <br/>\nare on Faydwer  I would say try for Crushbone, the Lesser Fay bandits, the <br/>\nButcherblock Orcs, or maybe the Steamfont skeletons (I think your a little <br/>\nhigh for the skellies though?). Near Freeport, I would suggest Desert of Ro. <br/>\nLots of wandering mobs. Near Qeynos I would suggest Blackburrow. I also hear <br/>\nWest Karanas has some good hunting grounds, though I have never tried there. <br/>\nActually tons of other places to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
