If you climb to the top <br/>\n&gt; and leap, you can <br/>\n&gt; just reach the wall.  By running and leaping, you can get <br/>\n&gt; around to most of <br/>\n&gt; the city walls and rooftops.  The graphics there are <br/>\n&gt; unfinished, and I have <br/>\n&gt; a nice overhead shot of me standing on the wall watching the <br/>\n&gt; moon rise <br/>\n&gt; BENEATH me - a bit vertiginous, that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, ok, I climb a lot, just to see what&#39;s up there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know whether this is possible for you non-woodelves <br/>\n&gt; or not.  My <br/>\n&gt; friend Bayrn, a high-elf cleric, tried over and over but <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t climb to <br/>\n&gt; the top of the tree.  I wonder whether we woodelves actually <br/>\n&gt; are better at <br/>\n&gt; climbing trees? = )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aloro (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
