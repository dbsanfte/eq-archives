Based on the recent statements by GZ, there are<br/>\na couple of strikes working against us in regards to the Pixie Strike song.<br/>\nFirst off, because it has two effects (mezmerize plus magic resist debuff),<br/>\nmobs have an increased chance to resist it.  This is similar to how CoD and<br/>\nDDD work.  CoD only has one effect (AE DOT) while DDD has two (AE DOT and AC<br/>\ndebuff).  Mobs resist DDD a lot more than CoD.  Example: I can regularly get<br/>\nCoD to stick against ogre bouncers (with a very high MR).  I don&#39;t even<br/>\nwaste my time trying to get DDD to stick.  Second strike is the second<br/>\nresist check mobs get against pixie strike (and lullaby).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you combine the higher chance to resist because pixie strike has two<br/>\neffects plus the two chances to resist the song outright, this song is not<br/>\nreliable as we would like it to be.  I propose we submit a petition to<br/>\nVerant requesting that they nerf pixie strike and remove the magic resist<br/>\ndebuff.  In this case, the nerf would be an actual improvement in the songs<br/>\nutility.  The mobs still get a second chance to resist but the base resist<br/>\nchance is lower because they are only resisting one effect (mezmerize).<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Can someone confirm when the MR debuff aspect of pixie strike was added<br/>\nto the song?  IIRC, some of you have posted that it was not originally a<br/>\npart of the song but was secretly added with a patch a few months ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually its 49.75%  That&#39;s the original 25% plus 33% of the remaining 75%<br/>\n&gt; (24.75%) for a total of nearly 50%.  Its still ugly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK I got one for Dean and John.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We all know that mobs get a second resist check against pixie strike and<br/>\n&gt; lullaby.  Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; resist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>\n&gt; overall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
