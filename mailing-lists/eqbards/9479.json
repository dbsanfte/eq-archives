I tried Dvinn at 25th or 26th and was<br/>\nso stupid/cocky that I didn&#39;t even get bound.  Man did he smack me down.<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  &quot;You have entered the Arena&quot;  Doh!  This is the<br/>\nreally odd part: A 43rd level Druid that I&#39;d helped the day before IN KERRA<br/>\nISLE of all places happened to see me die IN CRUSHBONE and gave me a<br/>\nteleport back to my corpse.
