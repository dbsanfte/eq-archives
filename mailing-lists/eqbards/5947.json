So that is a new change, and it&#39;s in the game proper <br/>\n(I wasn&#39;t playing on the test server).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they left the change as it is now, but add the ability for the target of <br/>\nSoW to manually cancel it (self-only) by left-clicking the icon (the way <br/>\ncasters can cancel buffs they cast on themselves), it would solve the <br/>\nproblem in short order, I think. Would still keep grouped bards from ruining <br/>\neverything if they panic and hit Accelerando (because SoW would still <br/>\noverride), but would also allow bards who are flying solo, escorting a small <br/>\ngroup of newbies or have just left a group [or just got buffed by a <br/>\nless-than-astute, but well-meaning shaman or druid] to use Accelerando to <br/>\ntheir benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a wise man once said, oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Juke<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] SoW vs. Accelerando conflict<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 01 Sep 1999 14:33:07 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 07:23 PM 9/1/99 +0000, &quot;Jukeboxie the Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jukeboxie@...\">jukeboxie@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;snip story about SoW overriding Accelerando&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If it&#39;s been like this for a while, sorry.
