A lot of people, especially the shamans, are really<br/>\n&gt; disgusted if<br/>\n&gt; everything Abashi stated was true.  To sum up what he said in very general<br/>\n&gt; terms, DEX and AGI have no impact whatsoever on combat skills like dodge,<br/>\n&gt; block, riposte, and parry.  DEX has no impact on improving your chance to<br/>\n&gt; get a successful hit.  There was more to his post but DEX and AGI I think<br/>\n&gt; are the two stats everyone was primarily complaining about.  One<br/>\n&gt; person even<br/>\n&gt; posted that for the melee classes, since stats are almost<br/>\n&gt; meaningless, EQ is<br/>\n&gt; more a first person shooter than a RPG.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If its true that primary stats don&#39;t really affect combat skills<br/>\n&gt; that much,<br/>\n&gt; I wonder how important resist rates are?  I would really hate to find out<br/>\n&gt; that they aren&#39;t important in successfully making a resistance roll as we<br/>\n&gt; think they are.  Black helicopter sighting here:  the other night I was in<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore and my party decided to pull a negotiator that was wandering.  I<br/>\n&gt; equipped drum and weaved both elemental and guardian rhythms.  That raised<br/>\n&gt; my magic resist rate to well over 100.  Myself and three other<br/>\n&gt; people in my<br/>\n&gt; party still got charmed by the negotiator.  I had told everyone beforehand<br/>\n&gt; that I would have both songs up for the entire fight so none of us were<br/>\n&gt; likely to get charmed.  To say the least I wasn&#39;t the most<br/>\n&gt; popular person in<br/>\n&gt; the group after that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 30 bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sadly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
