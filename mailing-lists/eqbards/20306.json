Question is:<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know what chipset is on your board?  If it&#39;s an Intel BX-440 Chipset<br/>\nit will support processors all the way up to the PIII - 1000 so you could<br/>\nfeasibly just upgrade your processor to a PIII and stick another 64mb of ram<br/>\nin it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if it&#39;s an older board, with all you&#39;ve done to it already, you&#39;d be<br/>\nbetter off just getting a board, processor and another stick of 64mb ram.<br/>\nIt&#39;ll save you a ton of money over buying a whole new system when you only<br/>\nreally need a memory and processor upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 12:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Newbie Bard needs hunting suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Something wrong with a PII 200 with 64 MB RAM?

I feel like I&#39;m<br/>\nsinking<br/>\n&gt; time and money into a junk car at this point.
