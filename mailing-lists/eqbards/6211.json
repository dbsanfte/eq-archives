I need advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail and well met fellow bards of Norrath,<br/>\n <br/>\nI come to you today with several small problems looking for assistance and<br/>\nadvice.  When I first joined this list, you all seemed to think that the<br/>\nmajor component of a bard&#39;s attributes was Charisma, so on all of the<br/>\nsuggestions I axed my human bard with low charisma (who&#39;s body I could not<br/>\nrecover anywho) and made my half-elf bard with a whopping 110 starting<br/>\ncharisma.  Anyway.....<br/>\n <br/>\nThat has now come back to bite me in the ass.  I am now at level 20<br/>\n(FINALLY!!!!!!) and am in search of bronze plate.  Unfortunately, med bronze<br/>\nseems incredibly rare (and expensive-I still haven&#39;t found the cash cow that<br/>\neveryone talks about hehe) to purchase.  So I am now in Permafrost where the<br/>\nbronze lives.  So now I have 3 pieces-breastplate, sleeves (vambraces,<br/>\nwhatever) and a mask.  Only problem is that now I am only 10 from my total<br/>\ncarrying weight (which is a whopping 82 buffed).  I plan on just getting the<br/>\nvisible pieces, minus the boots-they just seem so uncomfortable.  With a<br/>\npair of greaves, one bracer and the helm, I shan&#39;t be able to carry anything<br/>\nanymore!<br/>\n <br/>\nHere are my questions:<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease tell me of STR items it would be possible for me to get.  (I have one<br/>\nring (I forget what kind) +2, and a purity belt, and a spiked collar.)<br/>\nPlease bear in mind that I am poor (50pp in the bank on a good day) and I<br/>\nlike to live.<br/>\nAlso if any other people out there know off the cuff, who drops the greaves<br/>\n(bronze leggings) and the bronze helm in Permafrost.  Is it a named somebody<br/>\nor is it a random thing?<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you all in advance!<br/>\nWeiland Spellsong<br/>\n20th chorus bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\nDisciples of Truth</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
