The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; *that* great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading about<br/>\n&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, well, I&#39;m level 39 now so cash comes in more freely. Giants drop<br/>\n0-35plat usually, might wipe out a few dozen giants in a day. Most any<br/>\nmonster I kill drops 4 plat in cash, plus fine steel a third of the time<br/>\n(another 5 plat), plus occasional bronze (which is sold for 20plat or<br/>\ngiven away).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with that, it&#39;s safe to say that without paying attention at all to<br/>\nloot, it&#39;s easy to make 100 plat a day.
