One said it was exactly the same as the mana stone, and one<br/>\nagrees with your numbers of 50 hp and 25 mana.  So, I&#39;m assuming I was<br/>\nmisinformed, and I stand corrected.  However, both were quick to bring up<br/>\nthat to use cannabalize effeciently, they have to cast it 20 times, which<br/>\ntakes like 2 to 3 minutes.  Mana stoning 20 times takes about 15 seconds,<br/>\nand the rest of the time could be spent medding.  So in the end, the mana<br/>\nstone is better, according to both of them anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
