My question is: Is this<br/>\n&gt; true?  And if so, how much more experience are we talking about?  Is it<br/>\n&gt; worth the night vision and foraging to play wood-elf bard with the increased<br/>\n&gt; experience needed to level?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I play a half-elf bard but I&#39;ve found that this kind of question is<br/>\nmore a case of personal preference.  After all, do you want to level<br/>\nfaster but in return have to carry a lightsource around at all times like<br/>\na human does?  Or do you want to be able to wear small and medium armors<br/>\nlike a wood elf can?  Or would you want to be accepted (not necessarily<br/>\nliked) in elven and human lands like a half-elf can?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all personal preference based on what your goals are for your<br/>\ncharacter, or at least that&#39;s my view.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrei the Half-Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nLife without bears would be unbearable.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
