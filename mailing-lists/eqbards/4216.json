Very very<br/>\nvery few people don&#39;t know what RTS is. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re gonna learn<br/>\npretty fast when playing. Therefore I consider it common knowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my book, it&#39;s the same as acting as if it&#39;s bad for me to say &#39;the<br/>\nranger guild&#39;. Someone out there, somewhere, might not know that the<br/>\nranger guild is in Surefall and Kelethin. So therefore, according to the<br/>\nno-acronyms logic, I should explain the locations of them since someone<br/>\nmight know them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you get into explaining everything because someone somewhere<br/>\nmight not know it..<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
