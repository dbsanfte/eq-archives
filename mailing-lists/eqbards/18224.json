The Brae giants are<br/>\n&gt; green at 45 up to the Patriarchs<br/>\n&gt; and Steaps (sp?) which are blue at 51.  The Brae are pretty easy and make<br/>\n&gt; up the bulk of the giants while<br/>\n&gt; the Patriarchs hit DARN hard and really takes a good party to take out (we<br/>\n&gt; had 2 warriors levels 51 and<br/>\n&gt; 46, a 51 shaman with the new slow spell  which works AWESOME, a 45 druid,<br/>\n&gt; a 42 rogue and me and we still<br/>\n&gt; had both warriors under 2 bubbles of health when we got the AC25 tunic).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course the REAL good stuff drops on the Pats, but the steaps and brae<br/>\n&gt; drop the weapons and tunics that<br/>\n&gt; you would want to sell to the vendors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Daniel P.

You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of<br/>\n&gt; new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items including a ring AC10 +10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about EVERY class and race except<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which<br/>\n&gt; goes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great with her Efreeti ring on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leather so it is hilareous to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; protect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe.  The key though is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; human/euradite only.  Both items<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now the best and coolest websites come right to you based on your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unique interests. eTour.com is surfing without searching.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And, it&#39;s FREE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956935959/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956935959/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Now the best and coolest websites come right to you based on your <br/>\n&gt; unique interests. eTour.com is surfing without searching. <br/>\n&gt; And, it&#39;s FREE!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956936484/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/451022/_/956936484/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
