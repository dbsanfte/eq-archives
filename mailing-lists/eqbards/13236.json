An OOC<br/>\ncomment was made as follows: &quot;I never thought I&#39;d read about a exploit<br/>\non eqbards and see it being used in-game by a bard on that list&quot;. Three<br/>\nmembers of your group replied they were not using any exploit, but you<br/>\nwere, since I am familiar with the exploit, and you WERE using it. How<br/>\ndo I know? I made the OOC comment, I was on another character. I never<br/>\nsent you any tell, and never said you would be banned, as that is not in<br/>\nmy power to do so. A member of your party commented &quot;exploits are part<br/>\nof the game&quot; to which I replied &quot;and it is a part of the game, that when<br/>\nused, is bannable without warning&quot;. This has been stated by Karana&#39;s<br/>\nGM-Lead (Mennix) over server broadcast before, you may ask him how he<br/>\nfeels about people using the cazic temple pathing exploit to verify this<br/>\nshould you feel like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want you to feel you didn&#39;t have a face for your accuser,<br/>\nwhich is me. I don&#39;t know whether you read this list before using the<br/>\nexploit at the Cazic temple or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact your<br/>\ngroup was using the exploit, and had been doing so for quite awhile<br/>\nbefore I commented on it. Had you truely been naive to what you were<br/>\ndoing, I suspect any ooc comment from your group would have been along<br/>\nthe lines of &quot;where?&quot; not &quot;no we aren&#39;t!&quot; as was the case with groups in<br/>\nother areas of the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo paraphrase John Kim, he said, &quot;some people view the pathing bug<br/>\n(exploit) as an annoyance, others as an opportunity. Obviously I will<br/>\nnever agree with you on this issue, since I view bugs and exploits<br/>\nabusing them as an annoyance, while you view them as a opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nBeatdrop Battledrum wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Beatdrop Battledrum&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Beatdrop@...\">Beatdrop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry about responding so late to this, I just got caught up on the<br/>\n&gt; list.  All this weekend I was hunting in Cazic and one night 4 of us<br/>\n&gt; were doing the Temple.  There was a group at the top and one on the<br/>\n&gt; outer area so we stayed on the first rung of the temple and were<br/>\n&gt; pulling when we noticed this bug.  Mind you, I hadn&#39;t read the list<br/>\n&gt; yet, so I didn&#39;t hear about this exploit.  One pull, we had two<br/>\n&gt; lizards and one started to run when we had it to the sliver, so he was<br/>\n&gt; heading down the last flight of steps where we killed him.  The other<br/>\n&gt; group watched us fighting there on the steps for this pull and after<br/>\n&gt; the fight I get a /tell from one of the members suggesting that I<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t use that exploit.  WTF?  What exploit?   He wouldn&#39;t tell me<br/>\n&gt; and I slightly forgot about it.  Then while our ranger kept trying to<br/>\n&gt; pull and couldn&#39;t get the lizzies to follow him, I decided to try a<br/>\n&gt; charm pull, which did make it so I can pull the lizards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few minutes later on OOC, the same guy that had sent me the /tell<br/>\n&gt; and one of his guildmembers, were basically accusing me of exploiting<br/>\n&gt; telling me I was gonna get banned, all because of the fact that I am a<br/>\n&gt; bard and the exploit was posted on this list... which he said later on<br/>\n&gt; in OOC.  I tried to explain what I was and wasn&#39;t doing but they<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t listen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a side note, I don&#39;t feel that this list is appropriate for posting<br/>\n&gt; exploits.  I don&#39;t want to know about them nor do I want to use them.<br/>\n&gt; Just because it was posted here, a few people were accusing me just<br/>\n&gt; because I was a bard fighting in the area of the exploit.  So please,<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mind the spoilers, but I am sure other people on the list<br/>\n&gt; including myself don&#39;t want to hear about exploits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~Beatdrop Battledrum &lt;Platinum Sphere&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Child of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; Karana Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
