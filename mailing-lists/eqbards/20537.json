Go down the tunnel there until you<br/>\nare knee deep in the water, equip your trumpet and begin singing.  I<br/>\npracticed there for 8 hours unmolested last week.  The only difference<br/>\nbetween what you will do and what I did is that I used Screech instead of<br/>\nDDD.  I don&#39;t believe your results will vary though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sunski@...\">sunski@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sunski@...\">sunski@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 18, 2000 9:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Practicing Brass in Kunark<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve read a lot of posts about where to practice DDD/brass <br/>\nskills, but I&#39;m afraid I deleted them all and now need the <br/>\ninformation.  You see, I had decided (having been there and verified <br/>\nthe safety) to do it in the Arena in Lake Rathe.  Well, 18 came and I <br/>\nam in Kunark.  I am not going all the way to Lake Rathe just to <br/>\npractice! <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said that they think brass skills are checked even when this <br/>\nsong is sung without an instrument.  I am convinced that person <br/>\nwas right.  The number of missed notes I&#39;m having is just astounding <br/>\n(frequently 20 or more in a row).  I realize that missed notes are<br/>\nnot <br/>\nuncommon for a new song, but this is ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if you have suggestions, please make them somewhere that a <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; level 19 can get to.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyressa (god I hope I put a point into brass before I came over here)<br/>\nThe Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBTW: Did you buy that new car yet?<br/>\nIf not, check this site out. <br/>\nThey&#39;re called CarsDirect.com and it&#39;s a pretty sweet way to buy a car.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6847/13/_/451022/_/963926783/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6847/13/_/451022/_/963926783/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
