Eventually, we scraped<br/>\ntogether enough folks to make a decent raiding party but all the old<br/>\n&#39;issues&#39; came back to haunt us: i.e. ineffectiveness of &lt;49 level folks; not<br/>\nenough 50&#39;s; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings were going pretty good and most of the folks had arrived and we we in<br/>\nad hoc groups - just hanging around slapping the IGD and the first couple<br/>\nIG&#39;s.  A level 51 Rogue decided to &#39;check things out&#39; and some how agro&#39;d<br/>\nthe whole lair.  He yelled over /gu &quot;DONT HEAL ME!&quot;  He was gonna eat a<br/>\ndeath but either a guest or someone just missed the call and attacked<br/>\nsomething.  Well, that began one of the most chaotic and uncontrolled<br/>\nbattles that I have ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were like 5 or 6+ IG&#39;s inc Priest of Nagafen and Magus, two icy<br/>\nterrors, a wooly spider and of course the king room gobs respawned and<br/>\njoined the battle.  Clerics and other casters were getting interrupted by<br/>\nthese green pests while an epic battle took place.  People were ungrouped<br/>\nand just calling for heals and whatever.  Thank the gods that most of these<br/>\nfolks had alot of playing experience and this was not their &#39;first time.&#39;<br/>\nFolks knew enough to try to root and separate as best they could under<br/>\ntotally insane conditions.  Everyone was playing their finest desparation<br/>\ntactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the dust settled, we stood around for a bit saying &quot;I can&#39;t believe<br/>\nwe won that!&quot;  We lost about half the troops but we prevailed in the end.<br/>\nAfter that, we buffed for Vox and charged her in the lair.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nwe just did not have enough of everything to take her down.  She chealed on<br/>\nus and eventually killed us all.  In the post battle analysis, if the one<br/>\nrogue with the Ragebringer had not LD&#39;d, if we had more than 2 enchanters to<br/>\nsieve, if we just did more damage fasster... yadda, yadda. Vox 1, &#39;twinks&#39;<br/>\n0.  But there is always next time!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. a 53 cleric took 2 deaths from the gobs to &quot;die down&quot; a level so she<br/>\ncould fight Vox.  Things you thought you&#39;d never hear on guildsay: &quot;WOOT! I<br/>\njust lost a level!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jay schultze [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 19, 2000 1:58 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Epic quest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe non-technical term we use for how we kill Nag/Vox is &quot;gimps&quot;. I bring my<br/>\n<br/>\n49th Rogue to raids. At least half of the people involved in our raids are <br/>\n&lt;53 secondary characters. We almost always have 53+ <br/>\nclerics/shamans/enchanters present to buff us, though, and I usually bring <br/>\nthe bard for pumping mana into the buffing team.
