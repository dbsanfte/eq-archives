Could it be we might have someone represent us that has a clue now?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Many of my people brag that they have been granted the best traits of their<br/>\nparents. Perhaps. But we also bear the burden of that heritage. Neither<br/>\nHumans nor Elves love us, yet we must find our way in their society. Often<br/>\nenough this isolation breaks our spirit. We have never found our own<br/>\nsociety, and therefore can find no place to call home. But for some, myself<br/>\nincluded, this has been a blessing. We are not restricted by racial<br/>\nboundaries, and have the pleasure to claim all of Norrath as home.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  -  Absor, Half-Elven Bard <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nForgive my happiness, i know bards aren&#39;t suppose to be all cheery and<br/>\naffect their entourage in a positive way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
