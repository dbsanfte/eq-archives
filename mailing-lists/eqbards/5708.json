I usually end up with the latter and the two wandering<br/>\npatrols of 6 Cents and 2 Legionnaires total would be disastrous to have walk<br/>\nin and get agro, the 2 legos I can handle, adding the 6 cents is suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&#39;Just my 6 cents worth&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t Kitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 26, 1999 2:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Some Information on Our Songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:46 PM 8/26/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Place 5: I can&#39;t imagine the nightmare this would cause in Crushbone as<br/>\n&gt;every green Centurion in range started stunning me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Strange, Kitasi, I hunt in Crushbone a lot, and while I&#39;m careful to keep<br/>\nan eye on what&#39;s around me, I frequently will stand next to a mass-melee<br/>\nwith the Lullaby going, just to irritate the orcs ;)  While I often end up<br/>\nwith 4-8 angry orcs on me, it&#39;s never more than I saw (they don&#39;t &quot;come out<br/>\nof the woodwork&quot;) and usually I don&#39;t have any real problem with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder what I&#39;m doing differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\nFor details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
