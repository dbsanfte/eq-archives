All of my friends <br/>\nand guildmates are typically bound in Freeport to go to Cazi but we will be <br/>\ngoing in from Lake Rathe. After thinking about the logistics of bringing a <br/>\nwhole group that far, getting bound in Freeport then going to Cazi, I think <br/>\nwe will not. We are currently bound in Arena, which is a basically empty <br/>\nzone right off Lake Rathe. This means we will have to cross the Rathe <br/>\nMountains and come to Cazi from the spectre side but having made the run <br/>\nfrom Cazi to Lake Rathe once, I think it may be the closest bind point and <br/>\nshortest run back. The casters of course will bind to whatever suits them, <br/>\nhehe.<br/>\nBrilinnia, waiting on second name :)<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
