What a view!<br/>\n&gt; Tons of new critters and some re-hashed(old art) familiar ones with<br/>\n&gt; different names.<br/>\n&gt; The one that caught my eye was a Dracolich. H-U-G-E bone dragon-type<br/>\nthing!<br/>\n&gt; I am assuming it would eat me really fast so I just stayed my distance and<br/>\n&gt; took a few pictures.<br/>\n&gt; There is a castle surrounded by a lake of fire. Not your regular lava here<br/>\n&gt; bud. This is FIRE. Looks really cool.<br/>\n&gt; Looked around for about 30 minutes carefully avoiding ALL creatures<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; everything cond Red as Lenin to me (of course).<br/>\n&gt; Took about 50 megs worth of Screenshots. I especially like the one where I<br/>\n&gt; top a hill and bump into Cazic Thule himself. YIKES!<br/>\n&gt; Run away!  Lord Thule begins shouting something about infidels and such,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; I had no time to chit-chat with him, for these big-o-ape-like guys named<br/>\n&gt; Shiverbacks took an interest to me along with their buddy the<br/>\nPhantasm(looks<br/>\n&gt; like a fat spectre).<br/>\n&gt; I saw a wisp-like critter, but was not close enough or in a stable enough<br/>\n&gt; state of mind to target it to get its name. However, I DID see an<br/>\nanimation<br/>\n&gt; next to it. Hmm. Wisp pet? Cool!<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll have to go through my SS&#39;s to get the name of most of these, as I am<br/>\n&gt; posting directly after logging off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have fun!<br/>\n&gt; Oh, BTW I used my 13th level gnome magician to run around in there because<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; wanted to bind inside in case I got killed so I would not have to run all<br/>\n&gt; the way back. =) SCARY!
