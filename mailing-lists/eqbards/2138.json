This song is also a death-trap for us if we have<br/>\nuninformed or uncooperative party members.  Don&#39;t assume anything about<br/>\nnew party members.  Tell them how the song works and make sure they<br/>\nunderstand the /assist command (telling them to assist someone is not<br/>\nsufficient--if they don&#39;t know about the command).  Also make sure any<br/>\nspellcasters in your party that have Damage Over Time spells do NOT cast<br/>\nthem on the mobs that you are singing lullaby to.  This subtlety might<br/>\nescape them, and again result in your death or severe beating.<br/>\nEverytime their spell pulses the monster will wake up, and my experience<br/>\nis that it will still be more angry about being put to sleep than it<br/>\nwill about the damage from the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRuss Fuja wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi fellow mistrels and other friends, I guess I have never really<br/>\n&gt; figured out how to use the lullably song correctly.  I wonder if<br/>\n&gt; someone could detail a play by play on how it might be best used<br/>\n&gt; against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter.  I<br/>\n&gt; honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok<br/>\n&gt; things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is<br/>\n&gt; an area effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what? Thanks<br/>\n&gt; for any help y&#39;all can give!!!
