Weeeeeelll - apparently, an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; of those two <br/>\n&gt;songs is a slight magic resistance debuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I noticed no change to my MR when I used Pixie Strike on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>myself.  Will have to test it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed this a few days ago while messing around in HK basement.  At level<br/>\n<br/>\n32, wind skill 165, Pixie Strike lowered my magic resist by 6.  It&#39;s not a <br/>\nlot, but it could certainly account for the ease with which the song is <br/>\nmaintained once a target is stricken.  Fufil&#39;s lowers MR by 10 at the same <br/>\nlevel... so (just a thought) in some cases where you&#39;re in a caster-heavy <br/>\ngroup it might make sense to weave Pixie Strike and Fufil&#39;s to lower the <br/>\ntarget&#39;s magic resist by quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this note, I have heard rumors that the damage done to players (and to <br/>\none&#39;s self) is only a fraction of the damage done to monsters (2/3 being the<br/>\n<br/>\nnumber I have heard most often).  Can anyone confirm or deny this rumor?  If<br/>\n<br/>\nit is true, then Fufil&#39;s and Pixie Strike combined will lower MR by 25 (10 <br/>\nfrom PS, 15 from Fufil&#39;s)... which is rather a lot, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
