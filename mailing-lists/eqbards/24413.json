This one doesn&#39;t seem to.<br/>\nThis song is supposed to stay gray until the interval for recast is done,<br/>\nbut the other icons should ungray when the song cycle is finished.<br/>\nEssentially, the icons should work like a clerics DA/DB. I&#39;ve waited well<br/>\npast the normal time that the other icons should come back up and they all<br/>\nstay gray. It took me awhile to notice because I usually do twist and just<br/>\nthrow that one in when something is running, and my normal macro has<br/>\nfinished it&#39;s cycle of songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe, 55 forever!<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
