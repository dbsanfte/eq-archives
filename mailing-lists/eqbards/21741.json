I noticed that even this mail list isn&#39;t very secure <br/>\nin that it does not mask your IP address that you sent your email from. If <br/>\nyou send email from the same computer you play Everquest on, and use a <br/>\nclient like Microsoft Outlook (or Eudora), then it&#39;s quite likely you are <br/>\nbroadcasting your IP address (kinda like I am, but this isn&#39;t my home <br/>\ncomputer).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone has your IP address, they can try all sorts of attacks and try <br/>\nto sniff out your password, unless you have a firewall.
