When and where did this ridiculous idea get started?  Back in<br/>\nNeverwinter Nights (the original on AOL), the only penalties to dying were:<br/>\n<br/>\nA.  You were sent back to the nearest zone entrance of the zone you were in<br/>\n(Where there was an picture of a gate to the zone next to it, which began<br/>\nthe term &quot;being gated&quot; or &quot;hitting the gate&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nB.  Any items you didn&#39;t have equipped, you MIGHT lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nC.  You MAY have to go the the temple in Neverwinter to get any adverse<br/>\nspell effects removed (Like a Feeb)<br/>\n<br/>\nDid this create mayhem and chaos?  Nope.  Did it take away from the<br/>\nenjoyment of the game?  Again the answer is no.  It actually ADDED to the<br/>\nfun  (I know that&#39;s a hard concept to grab in this time of &quot;game balance&quot;,<br/>\nbut please try to imagine it).<br/>\n<br/>\nWould no exp loss ruin the game for folks?  Only for the power-gamers who<br/>\ncan&#39;t get past the idea that maxxing out their character(s) doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nyou&#39;ve &quot;won&quot;.    Will this ever be implemented?  No chance in hell.  Why<br/>\nbring it up?  Just to throw it out there for discussion (if anyone feels<br/>\ninclined to catch it :o)   )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n27th on The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
