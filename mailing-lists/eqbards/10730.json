Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>\nimmediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>\nSoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>\nonly the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Yes Unrest is famous for trains.  None of the ones I have seen were<br/>\ncaused by speedy runners but by stupid parties.  Its the lower level,<br/>\ngreater incompetence, and large agro radius that causes horrible trains in<br/>\nUnrest.  The more pickup groups that are in a zone the more trains there<br/>\nare.  The worst trains of all occur in Guk where it is underground.  Being<br/>\nabove ground is not the train causing factor at least in Unrest, never spent<br/>\nany time in Mistmoore so not sure about there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 29, 1999 5:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Selos and trains underground<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; had zero chance of escape and the caster&#39;s had zero chance of death.

They are not concerned about you avoiding a train.  They don&#39;t<br/>\nwant you pulling huge trains to zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>\n&gt; not I fail to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Instantaneous travel doesn&#39;t cause the train to keep running to zone.  Fast<br/>\ntravel allows someone to lead the entire dungeon to the<br/>\nzone exit, causing many people to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about some of the worst zones for random deaths from trains,<br/>\nMistmoore, Unrest, BlackBurrow.  All these zones are &quot;outdoors&quot;<br/>\nand allow speed effects.  The trainmaker can run fast and make it to zone,<br/>\nand lets everyone else deal with the trainwreck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are usually less trains to<br/>\nzone (there are exceptions).  This is because the person<br/>\nwho gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make it to zone.  They will<br/>\ndie 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nA caster gating out has the same effect as death.  The monster drops the<br/>\nplayer off the hate list.  Unless someone else is also on<br/>\nthe hate list (or too close), the monster will return to it&#39;s normal spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
