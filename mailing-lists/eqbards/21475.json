This spell&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>\n&gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>\n&gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>\n&gt; value decreased.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
