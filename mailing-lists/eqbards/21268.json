Looks like we were both right, Kit :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Guys, all the planes are going to get an item upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral other older dungeons are going to be revamped too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFA style quests for every class are almost finished and in early testing<br/>\n(the weapons look really cool, btw -- I was checking them out today).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, rumor has it, the FA may very well be upgraded too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Veeshan&#39;s Peak items, I&#39;ll bring up this issue at the next tuning<br/>\nmeeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brad &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone is trying to ressurect your hopes_and_dreams.  Do you accept?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think she was referring to the massive trade skill upgrades that are<br/>\nunderway.  They look really cool, too bad my smith is a wood elf, sigh.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;A_kitasi_00 dashes YOUR hopes for 10000 points of non-melee damage.<br/>\n&gt;Your hopes_and_dreams have been slain!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Kyrisha<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ROFLMAO!!!  Sorry to cause you pain.  Could be there is some tie-in between<br/>\nthe two though, and some of the new materials for smithing may be required<br/>\nin the new weapon quests!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
