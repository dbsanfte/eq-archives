As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how much<br/>\n&gt;PP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>\n&gt;component by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>\n&gt;paid for it.

Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>\nacquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>\nwant the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>\ntakes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel is <br/>\nthe right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>\nthe looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad in <br/>\nthere own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>\nbonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>\nmarket to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending on <br/>\nthe item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop caring <br/>\nabout how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
