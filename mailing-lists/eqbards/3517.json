I find it shocking that you<br/>\nhave had trouble with this service.  In my experience, if you use the /who<br/>\nto find someone who is able to perform the service and the /tell them a<br/>\npolite IC request for aid (I usually ask if I might have a moment of thier<br/>\ntime and then describe myself as newly arrived and in need of thier aid to<br/>\nreattune my soul to the area) most are more than willing to help.  I have, I<br/>\nbelieve, only had one or two turndowns with this method and those were<br/>\nindividuals who were already part of another group and on thier way to find<br/>\nsomething to kill.  In about 95% of the cases, the caster in question has<br/>\nnot asked a copper for thier help and some even refused the small donations<br/>\nwe have been able to offer.  This has worked with all the classes capable of<br/>\nthe service, including druids, shamans and most especially clerics.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
