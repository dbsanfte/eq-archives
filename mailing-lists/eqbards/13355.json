I&#39;d much rather<br/>\nbe a real  Hybrid with additional _defensive_ skills, rather than given bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ll take either.  The end of the original post says that we get the<br/>\ndownside of both types.  Fixing either is fine with me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni think he is using a bind argument in order to really say we could use just<br/>\n1 more defensive skill, such as parry.  i agree that we should get parry and<br/>\nhave it capped around the same as our dodge (125?).  it would just put us<br/>\none very small notch towards a melee class, which i do think we are far more<br/>\nthan a cleric or shaman.  i&#39;ve always thought we should not get bind, and<br/>\nall the reasons for and against have already been gone over a million times.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L37 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
