I really suggest the<br/>\nlist at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rpgdungeon.com/\">http://www.rpgdungeon.com/</a> or any of the lists that include a<br/>\nreview of the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Chant of Battle <br/>\n&gt;and Anthem de Arms are almost indestinguishable in effect as far as I <br/>\n&gt;can tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is <br/>\n&gt;better to use then the other.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anthem is MUCH better than Chant.  It&#39;s more noticeable in groups, but the<br/>\nAnthem speeds up your attack speed - something Chant does not do.  Trust<br/>\nme, tres valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Chord of Dissonance gives me no <br/>\n&gt;indication of much much dmg I do and if I choose not to juggle then I <br/>\n&gt;give up STR and AC to use it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Given a choice, I&#39;d burn Chords out of my songbook completely.  What a<br/>\nwaste above 10th.  At 12th, you should purchase, memorize and use the<br/>\nBellow.  It may not seem like much (max of 7hp per &quot;hit&quot;) but, first, that<br/>\nadds up, and second, you can juggle it really nicely with the Anthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Currently I have just taken to juggling between anthem, chant, and CoD <br/>\n&gt;while wading into battle.  Just made 12th but have not purchased many <br/>\n&gt;songs above 7th lvl.  Asside from healing (with mandolin) during or <br/>\n&gt;after battle my groups have not been overly enthused about the bard <br/>\n&gt;class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, first off, skip Chords completely from now on.  Use Anthem and<br/>\n*something else* during combat, unless your team starts to get a bit<br/>\ntrashed.  If you can, back off, start the hymn to help heal a bit.  Before<br/>\ncombat, the Lament (used WITH instrument) is a VERY powerful tool indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One last note is it true that song 11 and 14 do not work.  If so that <br/>\n&gt;really blows.  We only get 1 song a level (most of which are truely <br/>\n&gt;useless I only use 4 songs now and I am 12th level for cripes sake and <br/>\n&gt;now I get double screwed at 11 and 14th?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, but the way I understand it, everything that we&#39;re screwed on will get<br/>\nfixed or replaced in the next 6 months.  And, just for comparisons sake,<br/>\nI&#39;d like you to check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/enchantes.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/enchantes.htm</a> -<br/>\nThe Spellsongs for Bards in DragonRealms (a text-based massive mud)  This<br/>\ngame has been around for over 5 years, but look at how much they still<br/>\ndon&#39;t have working...
