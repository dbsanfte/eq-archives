This song was relatively but not entirely useless until<br/>\nVerant modified level 19 to be not just invis but invis/see invis.  At which point, they never bothered to<br/>\naddress the fact that this made level 24 pointless.  So looking at the weakness of 24 to justify the<br/>\nweakness of DDD isn&#39;t a good comparison.  Particularly since Verant just explicitly modified DDD to make<br/>\nit &quot;good&quot; in their way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Verant has never in any way indicated that DDD was tuned with PvP in mind.  In general, their<br/>\napproach is to make songs/spells work differently on blue and red servers in order to balance for PvP.  In<br/>\nthe absence of any other information, I am forced to assume that they believe that this song is balanced<br/>\nfor blue server play.  I couldn&#39;t disagree with them more.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeffrey Sue wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; well, for all the wood elf and half elf bards or bards with mask of deception or<br/>\n&gt; guise of the deceiver, they don&#39;t get a song at level 24 then (ultravision song).<br/>\n&gt; how about if we compare the ratio of human bards with no mask to the total<br/>\n&gt; number of bards with the ratio of pvp players to non pvp players? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
