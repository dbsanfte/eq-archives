The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>\n&gt;been removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>\n&gt;I almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>\n&gt;people felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>\n&gt;that this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>\n&gt;point regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>\n&gt;song in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>\n&gt;comments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;send in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt;Level 43 Bard<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another thing you might want to add is it is near impossible to stack your<br/>\nhigh level songs (I miss on average 20-30 notes a fight trying to twist<br/>\ncessation and cresendo) So if ya think you are smashing buttons now just<br/>\nwait =) Maybe add in that our instrument skills should not be capped at 200<br/>\nbut 250 or 255.. (Why on earth would they want to cap us in these skills??)<br/>\nI am fearing the thought of stacking Cessation and Verses...<br/>\nAs for skills the only one I am partial to is track...nice high cap ; )<br/>\nmaybe hide would be good if they didn&#39;t cap it insanely low.<br/>\nKarnek D&#39;Jester<br/>\nL48 Bard of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
