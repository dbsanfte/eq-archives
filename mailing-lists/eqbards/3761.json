They don&#39;t want <br/>\nto penalize people too harshly with exp so they decided that when you die, <br/>\nyou lose a few of your best items and a percentage of your money.  How&#39;s <br/>\nthat for not penalizing people to travel?  You all complain now at what <br/>\nEverquest does.. be grateful that it&#39;s the best game of it&#39;s genre at the <br/>\nmoment.  Nothing even comes close to it and I doubt anything will for a <br/>\nwhile.  Yes, it has its quirks.  And yes, it&#39;s taking a long time to fix <br/>\nthem all.  But would you have preferred waiting another year while beta <br/>\ntesters worked out all the bugs or enjoy playing the game now and live with <br/>\nthe bugs as they get fixed.  The more people are playing the more bugs are <br/>\nfound quicker and resolved quicker.  Now, there&#39;s just a matter of priority <br/>\nas to what to fix first.  And quit trying to make every frigging class the <br/>\nexact same as the other class.  You want to be able to bind?  Play a damn <br/>\nspell caster.  You want to be able to run fast?  Play a damn bard or shaman <br/>\nor something.  You want to dish out lots of DD?  Play a wizard.  Just quit <br/>\nyour whining and be grateful that you can&#39;t do exactly the same thing as <br/>\nevery other character in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just so tired of hearing people wanting their characters to be god so <br/>\nthey can kill everything in site.. go play Doom and enter god mode if you <br/>\nwant to do that and see how much fun it is after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my pipe blowing,<br/>\n<br/>\nPietree</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
