I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>\n&gt; of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>\n&gt; this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>\n&gt; this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>\n&gt; instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>\n&gt; a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>\n&gt; tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>\n&gt; on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>\n&gt; to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>\n&gt; frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My understanding of this, based on conversations with some GMs and high level bards<br/>\nas well as my own experience is that missed notes is related to dexterity, not<br/>\ncharisma.  It&#39;s hard to notice a difference, because it&#39;s surely just a few<br/>\npercentage points, but I feel like I miss fewer notes with a grotesque mask on than<br/>\nwithout.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
