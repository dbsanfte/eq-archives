I have<br/>\na request.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am level 35.  My guild is level 55+.  However, leaving my guild is not an<br/>\noption.  They are truly my friends, as much as any friend I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>\nLeaving them would be like leaving family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time, when I was closer in level to them, however, I don&#39;t get a<br/>\nwhole lot of playing time, and never have.  As a result, I&#39;ve been<br/>\noutlevelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy request is simple.  I&#39;m missing huge portions of the game, being limited<br/>\nstrictly to pickup groups in such everyday places as FM and OT.  I&#39;m missing<br/>\ndoing the truly fun and dangerous stuff like Nurga, Droga, Dalnir, Guk, etc.<br/>\nbecause I have no one to raid with.  I&#39;m sick of the safe, boring, pull kill<br/>\npull kill pull kill exp grind sitting on the side of a hill, with the only<br/>\ndanger being wandering Dragoons and inept groups.  I want to dungeon crawl.<br/>\nI&#39;m sick of dying due to ebay pullers (no offense to ebayers in general,<br/>\njust ebayers who don&#39;t at least start a new char to learn on before<br/>\nsubjecting the rest of us to inept high level characters).  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\ndeaths....as long as I can sit back while I&#39;m &#39;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&#39;ing,<br/>\nand say, Damn, that was AMAZING!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you will have me, please consider me when doing mid-level raids.<br/>\nIf any of your guilds are of the appropriate level, I&#39;d be glad to drop by<br/>\nyour message boards and post a note, to introduce myself.  Just send me a<br/>\nlink.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal Steelstring<br/>\nMachin Shin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
