The catch is, sometimes the<br/>\ncasters cast see invis on themselves or other mobs.  So far,<br/>\nI&#39;ve had the vampire oracle, a thought defiler, and Lasna see<br/>\nme at some time but not others.  I&#39;ve also had a gargoyle and<br/>\ndeathly usher see me.  (&quot;see me&quot; = /con ready to attack even<br/>\nthough I&#39;m invis.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re going to take a group in invis, I&#39;d recommend going<br/>\nsolo first.  /con everything along the route to make sure they<br/>\ncan&#39;t see you, or just run the route ready to yell &quot;TRAIN&quot; if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t mind training other poeple.  If you make it through,<br/>\nthen probably nothing along the way has see invis and it&#39;s<br/>\nsafe for your group to go through.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, the vampire oracle has a larger aggro radius<br/>\nthan other mobs.  There&#39;s a spot in the castle that I thought<br/>\nwas safe - no wandering mobs moved close enough to aggro on me<br/>\nthere while I was visible.  Then someone started a train, the<br/>\nvampire oracle came by, and saw a party member who was<br/>\nstanding there and redirected the train towards him.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
