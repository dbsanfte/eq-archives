Not to trivialize such<br/>\nthings,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t see how high-minded issues of balance of power can be used in<br/>\n&gt; this situation to make the idea of assisting her seem ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not.  I&#39;m saying it&#39;s really unnecessary to assist someone<br/>\nfor an event of this nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to draw up an analogy.  When you were in grade<br/>\nschool, you probably played kickball or soccer during recess.  <br/>\nNow, if your parents were suitably rich, they could&#39;ve hired a<br/>\nWorld-Cup-class player to play on your team during recess to<br/>\ninsure you&#39;d win.  But what&#39;s the point of that?  The goal of<br/>\nthis event is to have fun, not to win.  While it&#39;d be nice if<br/>\nshe can win, and if she can scrounge up nice equipment from<br/>\nfriends I have no problems with that, I don&#39;t see any need for<br/>\nme to run over and dump a ton of L45 gear onto her.  Surprise<br/>\nthe people there by winning with strategy and guile.  If you<br/>\nwin twinked, most people will probably just be disgusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if this were her first dragon raid, I&#39;d be more than<br/>\nhappy to lend her a ton of resist gear.  But in a dragon raid,<br/>\nthe primary goal is to win, and having fun secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
