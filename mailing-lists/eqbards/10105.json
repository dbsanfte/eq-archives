That is not a fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are the only person I know who does not know the difference between a<br/>\nfact and an opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Bards eventually become better than Shamans in melee, but not at level<br/>\n17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>\nthe numerous stuns I received.  All shamans have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>\nup, but it is still sufficient to stun a 17th level bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are better than all hybrids in magical power?  Under what microscope<br/>\ndid you determine that?  At lower levels its obviously true as the other<br/>\nhybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets examine them at higher levels.<br/>\nPaladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3 minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>\nand it takes them less time than that to meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>\nget Revive at their utmost level of spell use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>\nRangers probably have the weakest line of spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>\nthough they do get Wolf Form, cool but not overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>\nspells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness DoT line is devastating as it<br/>\ndestroys our best defense, Acellerando and it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>\nThey also now have the lifetap series.  All this aside their Harm Touch<br/>\nalone is a devastating if slow to recharge weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>\nnumber of spells than the other hybrids do though.  Are our abilities<br/>\nobviously better, I would not say so.  Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>\nbetter in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.  Even if we were better it<br/>\ncertainly would not be 5-6 times better and that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>\nrelate to us in terms of melee skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow since I have stated that bards magical abilities might not be so much<br/>\nbetter than some of the other hybrids, rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>\ntruly weak, feel free to call me a liar.  That will just be one more<br/>\ndefinition you will need to look up on Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>\n&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo further turn your argument around: <br/>\nBards cannot beat any caster consistently in pure magical combat. (though<br/>\nI&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>\nBards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee type consistently in pure melee<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of those statements however true prove we are weaker than those<br/>\nclasses any more than yours prove we are equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>\nare weaker than several of the other classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>\noverbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>\nthink a realignment of our skills would suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>\nmodifications to our spells other than including the missing ones and fixing<br/>\nthe broken ones.  An added melee skill like Parry which succeeds more often<br/>\nthan Dodge, and some raised caps on skills that are currently of debatable<br/>\nusefulness would help as well.  Most Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>\nself-sufficient characters while we are definitely not designed to be very<br/>\ncapable on our own.  We do best in groups due to the nature of our spells.<br/>\nIt is this very grouping nature that further undermines the usefulness of<br/>\nour other skills as there will often be present others in the group whose<br/>\nskill so far overshadows ours in those other areas that we might as well not<br/>\nhave the skill at all. There is no benefit to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>\nLocks when there is a rogue in the group with more than double your skill.<br/>\nIf we were meant to be characters who could function on their own and do<br/>\nnearly everything, if not well, that would be different.  However, we are<br/>\nnot.  We are meant to group and for every member we add to our group some of<br/>\nour skills become superfluous just as our magical powers become more potent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n1.
