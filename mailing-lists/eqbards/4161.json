Most people only hand off their<br/>\narmor to their 2nd and 3rd characters when they are done with them.  I doubt<br/>\nthey will get rubicite for example, and hand them down to one of their<br/>\ncharacters, then go back and try again for some rubicite, and had that down.<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that there are not some that do this, but from what I heard<br/>\nabout camping for rubicite it is an experience in frustration and most sane<br/>\nplayers would not do it again if they absolutely didn&#39;t have too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJohn Kim[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, July 22, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eqbards] Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER* (sort of)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 22 Jul 1999, Kyle Q wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I just had to reply to this, and then I&#39;ll let the subject drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forever. Enough has been said about twinking. I have to say, you have to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a real jerk to give somebody flak because they are twinked. This is<br/>\n&gt; called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JEALOUSY folks. Get over it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>\n&gt; multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>\n&gt; a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>\n&gt; to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>\n&gt; depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>\n&gt; increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>\n&gt; jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>\n&gt; out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (And I&#39;ll repeat what I said last time:  The real meta-issue<br/>\n&gt; behind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>\n&gt; because the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
