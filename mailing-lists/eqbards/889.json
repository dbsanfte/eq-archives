Example: The other day while<br/>\nwaiting for the boat in Butcherblock an friendly Enchantress<br/>\ncast a couple of Cha buffs on me raising my natural good looks<br/>\n(Cha 105) to 141. When I got off the boat in Freeport I<br/>\nnoticed a dark elf NPC hanging out on the rocks near the dock.<br/>\nShe con&#39;d as a dangerous blue, which normally would spell<br/>\ndeath for my at 18th level. But I decided to chance it, to my<br/>\nsurprise the battle went quickly with none of my Bellows being<br/>\nresisted and all of them hitting for max (10) damage. With<br/>\njust my base Cha of 105 I have had my bellow&#39;s resisted by<br/>\ngreens and have never seen a battle were even a majority of<br/>\nthem would do max damage. So all you enchanters out there keep<br/>\nthose charisma buffs handy for your team&#39;s bard. It will work<br/>\nwonders.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Rokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
