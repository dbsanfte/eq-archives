As far as I <br/>\nknow, there is _NO_ (double emphasis on that one :p) possible way for <br/>\na computer to generate a pure random number.  But, there are many <br/>\nways to &quot;fake&quot; a random number, some better than others.  (In my <br/>\ncollege statistics classes we used the random number tables in the <br/>\nback of the book... Open the page, point to the number.. Voila!)  I <br/>\ndefinately agree with Slyde and all those who say Verant&#39;s RNG is <br/>\noutta whack a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said... I don&#39;t have firsthand knowledge of Kaesora, but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see any point in why the guy would have lied to me.  I offered <br/>\nhim 50 pp for the coin based on what he said, but he ended up giving <br/>\nit to me for free.  So, it wasn&#39;t like he was trying to UP the <br/>\nprice.  There could be many things going on... Servers could <br/>\nobviously be slightly different in spawn %&#39;s... Or, more than likely, <br/>\nthe actual spawn % is somewhere between Slyde&#39;s and the guy who gave <br/>\nme the coin&#39;s experience with it AND those who&#39;ve gotten it easily.  <br/>\nThose on Xegony just had an unlucky weekend... Can I still switch to <br/>\n7th Hammer??? :p<br/>\n<br/>\nTo go slightly off topic here... I find it very amusing watching a <br/>\ngroup as each spawn of a rare mob or ph happens.  We were in Dalnir&#39;s <br/>\ngoing for the Necklace of Superiority this weeked for about 12 hours <br/>\ntotal.  We saw 2 drops the first day in 6 1/2 hours and no drops the <br/>\n2nd day in 5 1/2.  (I had heard the group that was there the night <br/>\nbefore us had gotten 1 in 8 hours.)  We got the first necklace after <br/>\na little over 2 hours time.  As the 2nd segment of 2 hours <br/>\napproached, people started talking about how it must be set on a &quot;10 <br/>\nspawn timer&quot;.  (Spawn time is 13 minutes if you want to do the math <br/>\nat home :p)  After that 2 hours expired, it turned to &quot;We&#39;re due for <br/>\nit to spawn&quot;.  Now, I get caught up in this myself (especially when <br/>\nyou&#39;re totally bored camping greens, when the only thing that even <br/>\ngives exp is the mob you&#39;re looking for), but this is the kind of <br/>\nthinking that causes people to go broke in Vegas. :p<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the few samples (I admit, it&#39;s not large enough of a sample size <br/>\nto really tell.. would need several hundred spawn cycles), I&#39;m <br/>\nputting my money on The Kly being a 5% spawn.  And just try <br/>\nconvincing those of a superstitious nature that if you go 19 kills <br/>\nwithout The Kly that you really, no _REALLY_ don&#39;t have a better <br/>\nchance of seeing him on the next spawn. :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is: the RNG turned up a 334 on a /random 1 392 and I <br/>\nwon the 2nd Necklace!!!  Now I&#39;ve got the headache of trying to <br/>\ndecide whether to keep it, or trade it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
