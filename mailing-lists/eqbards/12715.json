I cannot seem to make it to him without<br/>\nhitting multiple Gazz spawns (and a Ton Warrior).  I seem to remember<br/>\nbeing able to get to him failry easily way back in my troll warrior<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also ran into a repeated problem of a Froglok Apprentice, who would<br/>\nagrro on our warrior (lvl 13, rest of us are 14).  This is nothing<br/>\nunusal, however this wily frog would hit our puller with a DD spell,<br/>\nthen Run and get help (the circular room before the room with all the<br/>\nweird scoffolding).  We would never do a point of damage to him before<br/>\nhe ran.  <br/>\nThe only counter we had to this was for me to go pulling with the<br/>\nwarrior so I could stun then root the appretince (and then let my pet<br/>\nsmush it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this pretty bizarre (intelligent) mob behavior.  Is this<br/>\nnormal?  Any better ideas of how to deal with it (having your only<br/>\nhealer go on a pull is not a real great idea, IMHO)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
