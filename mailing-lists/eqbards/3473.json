To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and ask the cost for a<br/>\nnight.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it cost, say 1 plat,<br/>\nplayers could still undercut the merchants, but other players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nSOL.  This would still encourage players to work together to get bound in<br/>\ncertain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are inconvenient at<br/>\nbest.
