Things that 2 days ago<br/>\n&gt; I could charm, fear, or chain with now problem were<br/>\n&gt; now getting 3 or 4 resists in a row.  Things like<br/>\n&gt; lizard men in cazic and aviaks out at KFC (Karana<br/>\n&gt; Fried Chicken).  All things that conned blue to me,<br/>\n&gt; but were seemingly unimpressed with my vocal a talent.<br/>\n&gt;  Am I out of my mind?  I didn&#39;t have any charisma<br/>\n&gt; items one (except for my veil) so my charisma was only<br/>\n&gt; 95.  Could that be it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a more humourous note, I was passing through the<br/>\n&gt; Rathe Mountains and saw that big skele so I chamed<br/>\n&gt; him, he was standing by an orc shaman so I told him to<br/>\n&gt; attack it.  The fought, the charm wore off, and before<br/>\n&gt; the skele came at me, the shaman cast SOW on it. <br/>\n&gt; Couldn&#39;t believe it.  So I recharmed the skele who<br/>\n&gt; then made short work of the shaman.  Me and my pet ran<br/>\n&gt; down the road where couple of trolls where camping<br/>\n&gt; lizard men.  As soon as they heard the big feet o<br/>\n&gt; stompin, they scattered.  Had to send them a tell to<br/>\n&gt; let them know he was my pet.  My biggest complaint<br/>\n&gt; about the charm song is that it&#39;s so freakin fun that<br/>\n&gt; I spend 50% more time goofing off.  Oh well.  One more<br/>\n&gt; question, do you not get exp for a creature your pet<br/>\n&gt; kills? Twice I had a rook kill another rook and got no<br/>\n&gt; exp for it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Llewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I level like old dwarves make love, slow and sloppy&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
