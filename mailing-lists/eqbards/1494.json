It&#39;s risky,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ve found that to be a better way to save everyone than<br/>\n&gt; try to make sure they&#39;re all under the effect of Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; as they try to run away.

You can&#39;t be.<br/>\nHow can you say &#39;starts to attack your L10 party?&#39;.  One round and<br/>\nyou guys would be all but dead!  In the time it takes for the mage<br/>\nto stop meditating and stand up, he would be dead.<br/>\nYou sound like you are saying &#39;if you can get away in the first<br/>\nround or two of battle, you&#39;ll be OK&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say, &#39;if you say for the first round of battle, chances are you<br/>\nwill die&#39;.  Given the amount of time it takes to physically turn<br/>\nand run, equip instruments and fire up songs, you have LITTLE<br/>\nchance of survival at L10.  Hell, I&#39;m L13 and have only survived<br/>\nonce, and that was because I had accelerando and the drum going<br/>\nalready!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience there are only two types of encounter your group<br/>\ncan have with a super-monolith (side note - to me &#39;mob&#39; means<br/>\n&#39;more than one&#39;, monolith means &#39;one big one&#39;) such as an SG.<br/>\nEither you see it coming and keep out of its way, or you don&#39;t<br/>\nand a large proportion (approaching 100%) of your party gets<br/>\nsquished.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen an SG coming, equipped my drum and fired up accelerando,<br/>\nturned and run, and STILL been squished!<br/>\n<br/>\nMully<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
