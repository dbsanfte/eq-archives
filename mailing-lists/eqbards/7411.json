If it will work, its a possible<br/>\nway for bards to get bound in evil cities and safely return to their corpse<br/>\nif they die.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStep 1: Bard has two flutes in his inventory.  One is in a container and<br/>\nanother in a main inventory slot.<br/>\nStep 2: Bard groups with someone who can bind and gets bound in an evil city<br/>\nright next to the zone border.<br/>\nStep 3: The bard and the person who bound him go into the next zone, i.e.<br/>\nInnothule Swamp, Feerot, and duel right next to the zone border to the evil<br/>\ncity.  Bard lets the other person kill him in the duel.<br/>\nStep 4: Bard reappears in evil city, goes to the zone where he is killed,<br/>\nand loots everything from his corpse except the flute in the main inventory.<br/>\nBard sings invis song, using flute that was in a container, to get past<br/>\nguards and goes adventuring.<br/>\nStep 5: If bard dies while adventuring, he can then loot his corpse to get<br/>\nthe second flute, sing invis song, and safely get back to his corpse. <br/>\nStep 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 to get another corpse with spare flute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never dueled anyone so am not certain how it works.  I assume you<br/>\nappear at your bind point when you get killed in a duel.  I also assume your<br/>\ncorpse remains in place (duration based on your level) as long as there is<br/>\nequipment still on it.  This procedure also assumes that the bard doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget attacked and killed in the evil city while he is waiting to appear (i.e.<br/>\nduring LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  <br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
