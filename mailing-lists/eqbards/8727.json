In<br/>\n&gt;particular the Alligators were dropping a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot;, both were<br/>\n&gt;ALL/ALL and had NO stat bonuses.  Obviously quest items.  They were<br/>\n </span></blockquote>frequent<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;drops too.  After everyone in our group had a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot; we<br/>\n&gt;simply couldn&#39;t loot the alligators anymore and instead received messages<br/>\n&gt;saying something along the lines of &#39;You already have one such item in your<br/>\n&gt;inventory!&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;SO - If it is the case across the board that LORE items, once looted by an<br/>\n&gt;individual, cannot be looted (or even destroyed!) off of a mob by that same<br/>\n&gt;individual, you are going to see a LOT of free lore item calls from groups<br/>\n&gt;camping things like the Lizzy Fanatics in Cazic (mudwater runes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Again, my group left a trail of Alligators with Steins and Shovels on them<br/>\n&gt;because we COULDN&#39;T loot or destroy these items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone else encountered this LORE item behavior?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong - 26th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject lol.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
