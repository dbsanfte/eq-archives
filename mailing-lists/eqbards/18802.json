It really doesn&#39;t make much sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in answer to the whole AC thing.  I&#39;m not so concerned about our AC<br/>\ncompared to other things we can wear.  I&#39;m concerned about our AC compared<br/>\nto classes that are restricted from wearing plate.  There is no way under<br/>\nthat model that Rogue and Ranger armor should have the same AC as Bard<br/>\narmor.  I agree it doesn&#39;t have to be as high as Warriors, but it should be<br/>\nhigher than chain.  I suspect that the Clerics are in the same boat here<br/>\nthough I haven&#39;t paid any attention to their armor stats...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 52 Minstrel of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
