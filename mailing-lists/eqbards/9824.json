It was<br/>\ngiven to enchanters back when they were widely regarded a<br/>\nbroken class.  I&#39;d consider it a slap in the face that they<br/>\nget it before we do, if not for the fact that it stacks with<br/>\nbard Clarity and thus has only a positive effect on the<br/>\nplayers (aside from bards being slightly less desired in<br/>\ngroups).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part I agree with you that we don&#39;t *need* these<br/>\nskills to cap higher.  However, a lot of the early portion of<br/>\nthe game is spent in pointless button mashing to work up a<br/>\nskill to where it&#39;s considered &quot;usable&quot; by most players.  Our<br/>\nskill caps in many cases fall below that point.  e.g. Rogues<br/>\nlove to hit hide when a train is coming because they&#39;re<br/>\nvirtually guaranteed that it&#39;ll work.  OTOH, bards are<br/>\nvirtually guaranteed that it won&#39;t work so they don&#39;t bother<br/>\ntrying.  I&#39;d like to see it succeed often enough to make it<br/>\nworthwhile to at least try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attack speedups of Anthem/Celerity/Verses behind halved is<br/>\nanother gripe.  Halving Anthem I don&#39;t have much problem with.  <br/>\nAround that level (16), the enchanter&#39;s Quickness speeds you<br/>\nup by 20% and takes 80 mana.  A L16 enchanter (say 120 int)<br/>\nwould have to use virtually all his mana to cast Quickness on<br/>\n5 other party members; the bard&#39;s Anthem was doing the same<br/>\nthing.  So it made sense to halve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that this doesn&#39;t really scale.  They recently<br/>\nhalved the speed of Verses of Victory (L50 song), and from<br/>\nreports I&#39;m seeing it&#39;s gone from a 45% speedup (same as<br/>\nenchanter&#39;s L49 Swift) to about a 23% speedup.  A typical L50<br/>\nenchanter (say 170 int) will use a bit more than half his mana<br/>\nto cast Swift like the Wind (250 mana) on 5 party members,<br/>\nplus has Clarity to help him recover from it faster.  The<br/>\nsituation was nowhere near as unbalanced as it was with the<br/>\nAnthem/Quickness comparison.  In fact, a L50 enchanter could<br/>\ncast Alacrity (25% speedup, 115 mana) on 5 party members for<br/>\nabout a bubble and half of mana, and that would be *faster*<br/>\nthan our nerfed Verses.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted Verses does have stat buffs as well, but I think it&#39;s<br/>\nclear the imbalance was not as bad as with Anthem.  Verant<br/>\njust took the methodology they used to balance things at L16,<br/>\nand applied it to L50.  They probably should&#39;ve reduced our<br/>\nspeedups by a flat amount (say 10%) across the board.  But<br/>\nbecause they halved it, you get the ridiculous situation where<br/>\na L24 spell is faster than our L50 song.  Also, if this had<br/>\nbeen like Clarity and the effects stacked, then I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a problem with it.  But because they don&#39;t stack, it in<br/>\neffect takes away from what we have to offer to a group if an<br/>\nenchanter is present.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
