You&#39;re not going to find one awesome string instrument that does affect the mana regen portion of Cantana where others do not.  You can simply take a store bought lute, test for any increases and adjust that for all instruments with higher bonuses.  There&#39;s no secrets or surprises here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ah, ok.  Erp, how do we know it does not increase mana regen though?  I&#39;ve seen tests about the songs before, and how they stack, but I don&#39;t recall seeing whether a different stringed instrument would afftect the song differently.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">     ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) <br/>\n    To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n    Sent: Saturday, May 05, 2001 11:07 AM<br/>\n    Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: 55 Songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know it is less than Kelin&#39;s, so maybe 25% bonus give or take?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Shada<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt; Gaelthorne (who still has not run numbers on the Lute of the Howler)<br/>\n    &gt; Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
