If the high level<br/>\npeople hadn&#39;t killed all the &quot;good&quot; NPCs (I assume you mean<br/>\ngood-potential-loot NPCs), the low level people probably<br/>\nwould&#39;ve died a lot more.  Of course my server (Karana)<br/>\ncrashed before the culmination of the event (210 people in<br/>\nKithicor will do that).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends who stuck around afterwards and played a bit in the<br/>\n&quot;new&quot; Kithicor say most of the mobs there were blue-yellow at<br/>\nlevel 40.  Seems Verant is trying to give the L40-50 folks<br/>\nmore areas to play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat *was* amusing was a lot of the high level folks had the<br/>\n&quot;it&#39;s blue, kill it&quot; attitude so ingrained that they ended up<br/>\nkilling NPCs that were on our side.
