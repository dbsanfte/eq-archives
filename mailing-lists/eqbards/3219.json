I&#39;m approaching 17th and have even<br/>\n&gt;     procured a Dragoon dirk in anticipation of dual wield but my friend<br/>\n&gt;     feels it is more advantageous to carry my SB shield saying that the<br/>\n&gt;     additions damage form the occasional (why?) second strike does not<br/>\n&gt;     outweigh the defensive bonus of the shield.   I end up tanking about<br/>\n&gt;     half the time so this is an important question.<br/>\n&gt;          My friend was on beta so I usually trust his judgment. (And he is<br/>\n&gt;     also one of those power gamer types that always calculates everything<br/>\n&gt;     to the nth degree.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;          So let me know what you all think.  Shield or dirk? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
