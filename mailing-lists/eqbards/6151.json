So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; research into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game<br/>\nas a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you<br/>\ndevelop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your skills more fully.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Where is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My<br/>\nguess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>\n&gt; will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>\n&gt; upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>\n&gt; L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>\n&gt; see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>\n&gt; party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>\n&gt; damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes when I&#39;m in a bad mood I think that if it wasn&#39;t for the mana<br/>\n&gt; song, Bards would be lower on the list for getting in a group than a<br/>\n&gt; rogue in most people&#39;s eyes. (assuming both characters are played well<br/>\n&gt; by people who are fun to have in your group)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
