Then last nite i was given a Tenticle whip by a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guildmate and WOW !!!!! I was hitting about every 2 sec. in fighting a<br/>\n&gt; Giant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spider I was getting 3 to 4 swings to every 1 of the spiders.  I must say<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that if ye have the means(17pp) pick one up.
