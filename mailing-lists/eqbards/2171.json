Lately I&#39;ve been hunting in Steamfront Mountains. I&#39;m always looking for a group to hunt mino&#39;s (great exp, and their axes sell for 4pp to other players). Whenever I do a &quot;/ooc Level 10 Bard looking for a group&quot; I get no response. Even when there are other level 9-11 players in the area. Are we bards no longer a valuable asset in a group? Has anyone experienced this?<br/>\n <br/>\n Tanthalias<br/>\n Half Elven Bard<br/>\n 10th Level<br/>\n Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
