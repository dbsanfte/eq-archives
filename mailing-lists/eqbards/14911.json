The escaped<br/>\nSplit Paw gnolls pay nary a bit of attention to the blue bardette as she<br/>\nstreaks by. Oh sure, they scowl but alas, lack the will necessary to<br/>\nactually attack.  A walled compound appears on the horizon.  This bard has a<br/>\nmission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe doors in wall have been foolishly left unlocked.  The front door on the<br/>\nother hand is securely latched.  Our bardette goes to the rear of the cabin<br/>\nand finds that she can sit very close the joint between the wall and the<br/>\nchimney and peer in through a crack just well enough to catch a glimpse of<br/>\nthe hermit.  And then she plays a song that no one in the area can resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she has his attention and hails him, he responds in a very mean and<br/>\nnasty manner. He asks who has the audacity to enter his house (we presume he<br/>\nextends his definition of house to his whole property.) (Author&#39;s note: we<br/>\ndid not happen to capture the actual dialog but you can get it in person by<br/>\nhailing him.  I wonder if they did not intend for there to be some &#39;secret<br/>\nway&#39; of actually entering the house but it is yet undiscovered or not<br/>\nimplemented. As there are barrels placed such that you can easily get on the<br/>\nroof, perhaps they had planned a pitfall through the roof as the way to get<br/>\ninside. But then never did it as it would mean having also some way to get<br/>\nout of the house.  Or a death trap for those too young to kill the hermit?)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:29 2000] a hermit tries to kick YOU, but misses!<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:30 2000] a hermit punches YOU for 2 points of damage.<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:31 2000] You miss a note, bringing your song to a close!<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:31 2000] Your song ends.<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:32 2000]<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:33 2000] a hermit punches YOU for 2 points of damage.<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:35 2000] a hermit&#39;s eyes glaze over.<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:39 2000] You say, &#39;what winds of karana&#39;<br/>\n[Sat Feb 12 19:14:40 2000] a hermit says &#39;So you seek the two Song Sheets.<br/>\nIf you truly want them you will help the cause of the Unkempt Druids.
