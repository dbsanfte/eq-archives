I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>\n&gt;had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with &gt;this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Every caster class has this problem actually. Yes i think we could use at <br/>\nleast a couple more slots for songs. I don&#39;t think bards have it quite as <br/>\nbad as Shamans though - they have a SLEW of AWESOME buff spells and if they <br/>\nwant to uber-buff party members they normally end up switching spells out <br/>\nEVERY time they buff. That would terribly irritate me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I can safely say that I will almost always have Selos and Hymn of<br/>\n&gt;Restoration memorized.  Anthem or Warsong is another automatic.  That<br/>\n&gt;leaves me with 5 slots for all the remaining 18 songs I know.  If the<br/>\n&gt;choice is hard now, I can&#39;t imagine what its like later on down the<br/>\n&gt;road.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still manage and don&#39;t really have any problem with song selection at 37. <br/>\nI have Selo&#39;s memmed when outdoors, but will swap it with Pixie Strike or <br/>\nsomething while indoors. Hymn of Restoration is pretty much obsolete if you <br/>\nare grouped with healers and have mana song. Now that I have Celerity and  <br/>\nstack it with Chant of Battle I never touch Bellows.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 37th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
