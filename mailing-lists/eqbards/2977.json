Any npc that will sell to me looks at me <br/>\n&quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and <br/>\nfound one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n(couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my <br/>\nloot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even <br/>\nafford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit & <br/>\npatterns for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale <br/>\nwho will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t <br/>\nanyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move <br/>\non to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from <br/>\nRivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives <br/>\nthe directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re <br/>\nnot easily reversed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\nWoodelf Bard, Level 3<br/>\nRivervale, Qeynos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just <br/>\nthat ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\nICQ#1976509</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
