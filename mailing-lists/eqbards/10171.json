IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT <br/>\n&gt; THE DELAY IS<br/>\n&gt; ON THE WEAPON YOU HAVE IN YOUR SECONDARY HAND.. Many people I <br/>\n&gt; know use a<br/>\n&gt; really low delay weapon in their primary and the higher damage, higher<br/>\n&gt; delay weapon in their secondary, because they&#39;ll get that many more<br/>\n&gt; chances to swing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IIRC, it first checks the delay on your secondary weapon... then it checks<br/>\nyour dual wield score.  If you pass your dual wield check, then you&#39;ll swing<br/>\nwith your secondary.  For that reason, it is advantageous to use a really<br/>\nquick weapon in your secondary slot (at least for raising your skill).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 32 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
