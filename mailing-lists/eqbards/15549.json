Months ago when<br/>\novercrowding wasn&#39;t as big a problem, singing AE songs in a dungeon zone was<br/>\nsuicide because you were likely to start a massive train due to the z-axis<br/>\nbug.  Nowadays, mobs in zones like LGuk are pulled usually within seconds<br/>\nafter they spawn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point.  Last Friday I was camping the assasin room in LGuk for over<br/>\nfour hours.  There was at least 70 people in the zone at all times.  We<br/>\noften had 5-10 minutes of downtime in between fights because we couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfind anything to pull.  I strongly considered singing DDD (still need to max<br/>\nmy brass skill:-) but could not convince my group that it was safe to do so.<br/>\nI even used the argument that in the rare event it did aggro a mob behind a<br/>\nwall, since there were relatively few mobs on track we should be able to<br/>\navoid starting a train.  It might have even been useful in helping us pull.<br/>\nThat argument didn&#39;t work either and we ended up having a lot of downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n35 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
