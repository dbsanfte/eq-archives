I&#39;m approaching 17th and have even <br/>\n     procured a Dragoon dirk in anticipation of dual wield but my friend <br/>\n     feels it is more advantageous to carry my SB shield saying that the <br/>\n     additions damage form the occasional (why?) second strike does not <br/>\n     outweigh the defensive bonus of the shield.   I end up tanking about <br/>\n     half the time so this is an important question. <br/>\n          My friend was on beta so I usually trust his judgment. (And he is <br/>\n     also one of those power gamer types that always calculates everything <br/>\n     to the nth degree.) <br/>\n          <br/>\n          So let me know what you all think.  Shield or dirk?<br/>\n     <br/>\n         On another note &quot;Elf skin gloves&quot; !!!  eeuch!  Isn&#39;t that a bit <br/>\n     grisly.  Don&#39;t know if I could bring myself to wear them,  I&#39;ve <br/>\n     adventured with too many elves, I would feel guilty.    <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold 16th Bard,<br/>\n     Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
