Depending on your server, they <br/>\nmay be camped all the time or never camped. I don&#39;t remember if I had to <br/>\nbellow/kite one a bit to get it&#39;s life down before I started all instrument <br/>\nattack on it, probably depends on your equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get to this island, you get on the boat at Freeport. Once in OOT, hop <br/>\noff at first stop (Sister Island). Then swim South by Southwest and you&#39;ll <br/>\nsee the island. You&#39;ll need to clear the skels to get gargoyles to spawn. <br/>\nIncidentally, before you camp, leave a couple of gargoyles on the island. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll kill the skeletons so that the next person just has gargoyles.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just need to be careful as to where you kite them as bellow/kiting can <br/>\nbe monotonous. Good money and exp though.

I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;looking for a NEW zone that a Level 23 bard can successfully solo - AND GAIN<br/>\n&gt;EXP - without spending a lot of time on CR&#39;s.  I&#39;ve been hunting in Dagnor&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Cauldron on Veeshan but the goblins are far between and it&#39;s been slow<br/>\n&gt;going.  One advantage (or disadvantage) is the zone is ALWAYS empty, only<br/>\n&gt;peeps passing to Estate of Unrest ever appear.  I&#39;ve had troubles hooking up<br/>\n&gt;with friends due to RL hours and stuff so grouping if kindof out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been travelling to BB and GF to help out the newbies and work on my<br/>\n&gt;skills but the experience isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;ve been to SK and LoIO which was<br/>\n&gt;fairly successful, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone of similar level.  But I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;looking for something NEW!  --  Any suggestions?  Locations?  Just drawing<br/>\n&gt;on all you highbies overwhelming knowledge.. /bows.<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Also -- as I recommended to my guildies.. make sure you change the<br/>\n&gt;EQCLIENT.INI file to support DirectX8 and log into the Test Server to make<br/>\n&gt;sure you&#39;re system requirements are up to snuff.  I had an older system that<br/>\n&gt;was running XP on a 3Dfx board (no current drivers available due to<br/>\n&gt;out-of-business) and it choked when I tried this.  Directions for making the<br/>\n&gt;change are in the patch message (you DID read them, right?).  The update to<br/>\n&gt;DirectX8 will happen whether you upgrade to SoL or not, better to test now<br/>\n&gt;and get the bugs worked out then the day they make the switch over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my 2cp..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bard-on dudes (and dudettes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~Drewt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
