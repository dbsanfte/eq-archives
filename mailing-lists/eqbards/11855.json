(I&#39;m level 24).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this works both ways, I try not to tell strangers directly how to play<br/>\ntheir characters. I bug my friends all the time and give them<br/>\npointers/advice, but it would be touchier with strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your level, it sounds like any mistake could be quite fatal. At any<br/>\nlevel, we all know how hard it can be to get together a real good group that<br/>\nworks like a well oiled machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut heck, this is all just a game. Isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nLol, nevermind, we&#39;re all reading these posts, so we know how serious we<br/>\ntake it. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually like to &quot;kid&quot; someone when I see someone doing things I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink they should do. It&#39;s different if it&#39;s something that will get the<br/>\ngroup killed, I will tell them directly, and if they don&#39;t listen, give them<br/>\nthe heave ho to a jig. :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s good to take into consideration other people&#39;s playing styles. I<br/>\nknow I can be very manipulative and kind of uptight about having everything<br/>\n&quot;just right&quot;. My wife tells me so. :-P So I try to be considerate and relax<br/>\nand play my little tunes and have some fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I really do enjoy reading all of these posts. Gives me something else<br/>\nto do during work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong, 24th song Mandolinier, Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 15, 1999 9:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Song Taunting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   So, the other day in SolB - the usual bat/bug group formed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Made 48th as I predicted, but I found that I was controlling<br/>\n&gt;   the group more so than I have ever before.  And well, some<br/>\n&gt;   L50 people decided to be &#39;back seat bards&#39; - which I promptly <br/>\n&gt;   disbanded them.  Had to tell the shamans to stop piercing the<br/>\n&gt;   bats for 5 and 6 dmg, and sit their pretty arses on the floor<br/>\n&gt;   to med.  Had to get the cleric on the floor a few times too.<br/>\n&gt;   Had to plan spell attacks, since the shaman was trying to <br/>\n&gt;   malaise the bat and poison it, before drowsying it.  Just <br/>\n&gt;   little things like that tend to make me wonder how these<br/>\n&gt;   people made L45+.  I mean if you wanted to swing a sword<br/>\n&gt;   or pierce with a spear, you shoulda decided that 40+ levels<br/>\n&gt;   ago.  If medding is boring, or you wanna raise your X skill<br/>\n&gt;   then I politely ask that those people either cease or leave.<br/>\n&gt;   Sounds strict, but when you have people&#39;s lives in danger,<br/>\n&gt;   and monsters that can hit in the 100s, I&#39;d like the cleric<br/>\n&gt;   to be medding for heals rather than bashing something with<br/>\n&gt;   a hammer and doing &lt; 10 dmg, mostly wiffing.  Then you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;   got these clerics that must nuke no matter what, &lt;rolls eyes&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;   Wasn&#39;t a good night, like the one before, to say the least.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   Some idiot wanted me to twist manasong in battle, when we only<br/>\n&gt;   had one caster and no snarer.  heh.  Chains alone basically is<br/>\n&gt;   a job in itself on these LDCs and lava beetles.  The same idiot<br/>\n&gt;   got fussy cause I wasn&#39;t playing the &#39;healsong&#39; for him during<br/>\n&gt;   multiple mob pulls.  (Without an enchanter, I become a shotgun<br/>\n&gt;   pixie striker - and that is in fact a full time job)  Making<br/>\n&gt;   two lava beetles disappear from battle with pixie strike is<br/>\n&gt;   a huge challenge.  But this dude kept ranting about how I should<br/>\n&gt;   be healing him at 6 or 7 hp per tick, heh.  So he takes a hit<br/>\n&gt;   for 102 and I heal back 7 of that - whooptiedoo! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The next pull, I agree to show him what happens when I just<br/>\n&gt;   &#39;speed him up and heal him&#39; as he put it.  2 sonic bats, and<br/>\n&gt;   1 lava beetle show up.  I start berserk, no problems.  They<br/>\n&gt;   stick on the tanks.  I twist healsong, and instantly I am<br/>\n&gt;   swarmed...  down two bubbles in less than 3 seconds.  Already<br/>\n&gt;   proven my point, then begin to attempt to recover this f&#39;up<br/>\n&gt;   with pixie, the guy is asking where the speed and heal are.<br/>\n&gt;   After all the things were killed, I located the hotkey bank<br/>\n&gt;   with my Disband button and clicked it for him.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   o Manasong seems to have very low taunt if any at all.<br/>\n&gt;   o Berserk may or may not get the attention of creatures,<br/>\n&gt;     it seems to depend on how close I am to the unconfronted<br/>\n&gt;     mobs.<br/>\n&gt;   o Hymm is absolute instant aggression.<br/>\n&gt;   o I would imagine Binding, and other AE songs like Lullaby<br/>\n&gt;     would create a fair amount of aggression too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make $$$ by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
