Even with my HIGHER cap as<br/>\na Wood Elf, any time I would find hiding useful I just would never use it.<br/>\nWhy?  Hide and I&#39;d more likely be killed than saved.  Very very likely<br/>\nkilled.  One can depend on hiding failure at our cap, with no way to tell<br/>\nsuccess.  So hide stays hidden in the skills menu, never hotkeyed.  O, and<br/>\nthanks for the sneak, just in time for the song which replaces it!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m certain Safe Fall a bard would find more useful than a monk.

Why give us the ability to forage if<br/>\nthe skill cap is 40.  The whole point for foraging is that it can take the<br/>\nplace of buying food.  So you can rely on it to meet all you dietary needs.<br/>\nI am a lvl 14 bard and my forage is maxed.  I use it constantly and very<br/>\nrarely do i ever get any rewards for my persistence.  I say we all ban<br/>\ntogether and e-mail Verant demanding they increase the skill lvl.  I mean<br/>\nwhy not, it&#39;s not like we can use the skill to make any money at it... LETS<br/>\nBAND TOGETHER FELLOW BARDS AND DEMAND VERANT TO ADD THIS TO THE NEXT<br/>\nPATCH.....<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sing loud and proud fellow bards...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
