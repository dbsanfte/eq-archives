Worse than the useless songs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2050541130\">IMHO:<br/>\n<br/>\nYa know, you are exactly right.  It would not unbalance the class.  But ya<br/>\nknow what? It would be almost totally useless.  Worse than the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>\nsongs we got now.  Time and again I have mentioned that when you reach level<br/>\n30ish and most of your playing is with a group and most groups at this level<br/>\nhave clerics, it does not much matter where you are binded!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, dying really is miserable above 30.  Die one time and you lost a<br/>\ngood 2 or 3 hours of work to get the xp back.  You can lose one quarter of a<br/>\nbub of xp in a single death. So, you get smart and you dont die as much.<br/>\nWhen you do, your cleric will rez (ressurrect) you.  He targets your corpse,<br/>\nasks you if you are ready so he knows you are not zoning or running around<br/>\n(you should be re-memming your songs), casts the spell on you and you get a<br/>\nyes / no dialog box, you click yes and get Loading, Please Wait...<br/>\n<br/>\n(BTW - this usually happens after a 20 or 30 min CR &lt;corpse retrieval&gt;<br/>\nsession as the others in your group who survived - the clerics bind nearby<br/>\nand gate before they die if possible - go back in and drag the corpses to a<br/>\nsafe place to rez. And 20 or 30 min is for like mid 30&#39;s - mid 40&#39;s and up<br/>\ntheir CR&#39;s take much longer if its a bad death - or so I am told. So where<br/>\nyou are binded makes little difference - you can run back and even be in the<br/>\nzone before they get you dragged out to a safe rez spot.  And then they will<br/>\nrez you even if you are right there in an attempt to get some of your xp<br/>\nback.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you appear next to your corpse with the &quot;rez effect&quot; (str, sta, health<br/>\ndrained and 0 mana).  You loot and get your stuff and hang out while the rez<br/>\neffect wears off.  It does not matter where you are binded.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a good group at these levels, you have someone who can teleport<br/>\nand thus someone who can bind.  So, at the end of the action, he generally<br/>\ngates people to where they need to go and slaps a bind on you if you want<br/>\none.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, if you are a solo monkey and think that 3am middle of the week is a<br/>\ngood time to explre the Kerran Isle cuz you have never been there in in 44<br/>\nlevels or you heard from your level 42 ranger pal that the Mino Hero spawns<br/>\nat 2:56 am Eastern time if you give the gnome guard some muffins and really<br/>\nwish you had a bind inside Kaladim cus you are gonna make some Tumpy Tonics<br/>\nthere - them ya a bind song would be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the most part, it&#39;s totally useless at the &quot;high&quot; levels.  Even at<br/>\nthe &quot;mid&quot; levels, and even at most times of day, you can get binds in<br/>\n&quot;popular&quot; places pretty easily.  Where bind would be usefull is for bards<br/>\nwho do alot of travelling at lower levels - like 8 to 18 (getting self-bind<br/>\nat 16 to 18 with a full mana burn and group bind - everyone in group at one<br/>\nshot with a full mana burn would be a value to the bard class.) <br/>\n<br/>\nBy my 20&#39;s, if there&#39;s a binder in zone, I can usually use normal say&#39;s and<br/>\nhave a nice conversation that leads to a bind.  If the guy&#39;s a high lev,<br/>\nthere usually no need to pay him. If the guy&#39;s a lo lev who just got his<br/>\nbind power and is still happy to show it off, I usually over tip him.  If<br/>\nthe guy wants to be paid up front, I don&#39;t even let him bind me and usually<br/>\nask how much he thinks I should charge to taunt the next mob off him when he<br/>\nneeds some help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nArrgh - i hate these threads on bards getting bind!<br/>\n<br/>\nBard DO NOT _need_ binding power (any more than any other class that does<br/>\nnot have it.) They especially do not need it at higher levels where it is<br/>\nsuperfulious for several reasons (rez, group gaters, groups with 2 or 3<br/>\nbinders, many friends.)<br/>\n   <br/>\nSylly - the bard!<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI still greatly doubt that a high level binding<br/>\nsong would be unbalancing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
