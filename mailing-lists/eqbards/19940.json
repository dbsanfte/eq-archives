I found out this morning when I tried to log in to play on test<br/>\n&gt;for a change.  It&#39;s never been my primary server (ok it was while I was<br/>\n&gt;powerlevelling myself to 50 there) so it&#39;s no big deal.  But it was my only<br/>\n&gt;50 char :(  My character on Saryrn is only 44 as of now.  It was nice to be<br/>\n&gt;able to say I had a 50.
