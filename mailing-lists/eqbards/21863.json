A tank<br/>\nwatching his hits will see an occasional bigger than usual number. I&#39;ve<br/>\nmet lots of tanks who will argue until they are blue in the face that<br/>\ntheir damage really is higher with a STR buff, dispite never once having<br/>\nactually turned their logging on and tested it with one of the log<br/>\nanalysers out there. I&#39;ve been leveling a warrior up when I&#39;m too burned<br/>\nout on the 55+ exp grind and I&#39;ve found criticals, dispite the<br/>\nimpressive numbers, account for about 3% of all hits, regardless of<br/>\nbuffs. I haven&#39;t spent the time to do exhaustive testing on STR because<br/>\nI&#39;ve already seen two well done studies that have me convinced. One of<br/>\nthose studies was also the first to really show the &quot;magic&quot; number bonus<br/>\nthat made the moss covered twig so out of balance, something even Verant<br/>\nwas appearantly unaware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidently I popped over to the Backstage to read Kaearia&#39;s messages on<br/>\nthe issue.
