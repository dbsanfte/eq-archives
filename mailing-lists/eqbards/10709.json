Monks out damage warriors only until the warrior gains some<br/>\n&gt;good<br/>\n&gt;weapons around 15th level or so.  After that the warrior often out<br/>\n&gt;damages<br/>\n&gt;the monk, but the monk takes less damage.  The reason for this?  The<br/>\n&gt;monk<br/>\n&gt;having no offensive items to spend money on is free to spend all his<br/>\n&gt;funds<br/>\n&gt;to acquire better defensive items.  The two do seem to balance out with<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;warrior doing more damage but the monk taking less.  Despite not being<br/>\n&gt;able<br/>\n&gt;to wear heavy armor our group monk who is 2 levels lower than me has<br/>\n&gt;nearly<br/>\n&gt;the same ac I do, and I have only one piece of armor with an AC below<br/>\n&gt;banded<br/>\n&gt;and several at plate or higher.  He takes way less damage than I do and<br/>\n&gt;until he is 35th level will probably never die again except in very rare<br/>\n&gt;circumstances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;good<br/>\n&gt;one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.<br/>\n&gt;A<br/>\n&gt;piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention<br/>\n&gt;bard<br/>\n&gt;only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is<br/>\n&gt;useless<br/>\n&gt;after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What<br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know what it would be.  Are there even any other items on mobs<br/>\n&gt;below<br/>\n&gt;30th that are bard plus a few others?  Shimmering Orb, great for looks<br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt;with dual wield is it useful?  Anyone know of anything else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items,<br/>\n&gt;why<br/>\n&gt;is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th<br/>\n&gt;level?<br/>\n&gt;There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and<br/>\n&gt;screaming<br/>\n&gt;mace available for bards at my level.  The only 1HS weapons available<br/>\n&gt;are a<br/>\n&gt;Polished Granite Tomahawk and a Barbed Leather Whip.  They don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt;begin<br/>\n&gt;to compare to our Shadowknight&#39;s Dark Reaver.  The primary weapons<br/>\n&gt;carried<br/>\n&gt;by every member of our group is better than either the PGT or the BLW.<br/>\n&gt;Why?<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s a good question.  Since we don&#39;t have anybody near my level who<br/>\n&gt;is a<br/>\n&gt;melee class (or hybrid other than the SK) its really puzzling.  Our<br/>\n&gt;mages<br/>\n&gt;carry Glowing Wooden Crooks or better, at 150pp not hard to see why.<br/>\n&gt;The<br/>\n&gt;shadowknight has a dark Reaver and I&#39;m using the same primary as the 7th<br/>\n&gt;level ranger, a dragoon dirk.  At 25pp who would blame him?  A good 1HS<br/>\n&gt;weapon on the other hand cost 400pp+.<br/>\n&gt;Why does this inequity exist?  Because in truth their are far more good<br/>\n&gt;piercing weapons per piercing user than 1HS per 1HS user.  All the good<br/>\n&gt;1HS<br/>\n&gt;weapons at the mid-levels are either warrior or paladin or ranger only.<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;could currently get thru quests at least 6 weapons I cannot use.  The<br/>\n&gt;quests<br/>\n&gt;are easily doable for a group of my level or close (21st).  I can get no<br/>\n&gt;decent weapons via quest that I can use except the Screaming Mace that I<br/>\n&gt;did<br/>\n&gt;9 levels ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Believe me if anyone can refute this and offer me a solution to where I<br/>\n&gt;might find a better weapon obtainable I&#39;d be glad to hear it.  I get<br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt;tired of having my own guild members laugh, &quot;you still using that little<br/>\n&gt;sticker?&quot;  I suppose I could buy a PGT, but at the 250pp they go for on<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;it hardly seems justifiable.  Any suggestions out there?  I currently<br/>\n&gt;own 4<br/>\n&gt;magical piercing weapons (don&#39;t ask), and 2 magical 1HB, but only a<br/>\n&gt;combine<br/>\n&gt;Scimitar for 1HS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi Ireallyshouldthinkupalastname of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &quot;materialistically inclined? not usually, but all those guild<br/>\n&gt;posts,<br/>\n&gt;sheesh!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; CONCLUSION<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some<br/>\n&gt;items<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can be. It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an<br/>\n&gt;intuitive<br/>\n&gt;feel<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses,<br/>\n&gt;classes,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by<br/>\n&gt;running<br/>\n&gt;&gt; simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you<br/>\n&gt;expect.<br/>\n&gt;Then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real<br/>\n&gt;world<br/>\n&gt;&gt; usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use<br/>\n&gt;this?<br/>\n&gt;Is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you<br/>\n&gt;made<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the right decision.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This guy is like a god.  When I read his stuff, I get more<br/>\n&gt;  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>\n&gt;  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>\n&gt;  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were<br/>\n&gt;  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>\n&gt;  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
