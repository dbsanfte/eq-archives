Because those two songs allowed them the most Fun ever in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d never guess which two of our songs they picked, rarely used.  One of<br/>\ntheir favorites was Jig O Vigor.  Heheh, the other was Aquatic Ayre!  We<br/>\nwere swimming around in Oasis, fighting aqua goblins... and it was a BLAST!<br/>\nI tend to agree with them: those two became my favorite songs!  Giant ogres<br/>\nswimming over my head, we hadn&#39;t seen the sky in hours, many folks kept<br/>\nrepeating they never had so much fun in Everquest.  Neither did I!<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in some boring group in Oasis sitting around on the beach, suggest<br/>\neverybody dive in!  You won&#39;t regret it.  Great loot from those aqua<br/>\ngoblins, too,<br/>\nmight I add!  Sold a lot of bows and leather....<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was a great experience, that was the reward, I must find more aquatic<br/>\nplaces like that!  O the zone was packed and competitive, yet we had the<br/>\nwaters all to ourselves.  LOL, imagine someone going down there to fetch and<br/>\nseeing a group with a bard in the murky depths and muttering, &quot;Damn<br/>\ncampers!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
