I am 920ish AC (iirc) now without songs<br/>\nor buffs (Froglok Scale BP, Imbrued Greaves and SS everything else.) Cougar<br/>\nears and Mith Torque, Guise of Deceiver (could prolly do better here),<br/>\nObulous mantle, Cloak of Shadows (prestige and +dex) and Sainy&#39;s Claw for<br/>\n10ac.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured that with GRM in &#39;real groups&#39; or Psalm of Mystic Shielding - I<br/>\nwill be fine when I need MR.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave I noticed anything remarkable?  Not really.  I have been helping my<br/>\nwizard level by pulling snow cougars.  I use shield of songs (rune buff)<br/>\nthen time my mez with his nukes. Mez lands right after his nuke.  Got bored<br/>\nand tried to explore Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Managed to agro 3 things, run<br/>\nto the wrong mirror, and died - all this on the first floor too!. /sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, my ac 5 hp 55 rings get passed to my rogue, I have ac 6 hp 66 ones<br/>\nfor back up.  Also carry black plat pearl for dex if I get mad at missed<br/>\nnotes and some Opal ones (poison resists?) if people get bored and want to<br/>\nkill Sev or Trak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 15, 2001 10:09 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Ring Recommendation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worn the 5ac, 55hps rings for a long time now, and recently <br/>\nupgraded to the velium 6ac, 65hp rings.
