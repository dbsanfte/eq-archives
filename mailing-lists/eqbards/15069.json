I&#39;m nearing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the magical L17 and dual wield, and I&#39;m wondering what are the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; most effective weapon? I was thinking of combine longswords <br/>\n&gt;&gt; for a while, but it seems now-adays with my fine steel <br/>\n&gt;&gt; longsword I&#39;m missing 2/3 of my swings anyway (exaggeration<br/>\n&gt;&gt; alert!). Recently switched to a fine steel short and even <br/>\n&gt;&gt; though I went from 12 dmg per round to 8, I&#39;m missing a lot<br/>\n&gt;&gt; less. There is obviously a balance to be reached, so my question<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is .. high delay : high damage? Or vice versa?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Get a logfile parser.  Fight the same mobs for a long time<br/>\n&gt;(i.e. camp a spot).  Use one weapon half the time, use the<br/>\n&gt;other weapon half the time.  Parse your logfile and figure out<br/>\n&gt;which one you do better with.<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.

From the what has been posted,<br/>\nit seems Sylly has had luck with piercing weapons (low damage/delay)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, my piercing skill is... one. So, any advice on good<br/>\nslashers or blunt weapons? ( I have a feeling blunt weapons are<br/>\nadjusted by Verant to have lower damage/delay ratios than equivalent<br/>\nslashing weapons. )<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Hire</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
