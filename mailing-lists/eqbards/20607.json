If I m injured","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1172993634\">Another thing that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is timing the recharm.  As soon as<br/>\nyour pet is charmed and sent to attack, you should start up a song.  If I&#39;m<br/>\ninjured I use Hymn, otherwise I use Selo&#39;s.  As soon as it pulses, I stop it<br/>\nand start a second song.  Selo&#39;s for sure this time.  As soon as it pulses I<br/>\nstop it and count to 4 or 5 slowly, as in 1 one thousand 2 one thousand...<br/>\nbetween the 4 and the 5 I will start the charm song.  Usually I will get a<br/>\ncharm wears off followed by a glazed message before the mobs have taken more<br/>\nthan a couple of steps toward me.  If I get a resist I will pulse Selo&#39;s<br/>\nagain before trying another charm to avoid getting pounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;ve started doing is...  as soon as the pet is recharmed I<br/>\nwill run past the mobs and turn to face them again.  This way I do a better<br/>\njob of avoiding wanderers, and usually end the fight at approximately the<br/>\nplace it started.  I&#39;ve tried using other views but find them less<br/>\nimmersive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my pet has won, I will wait for the charm to wear off, lead it a little<br/>\ndistance from the corpse, recharm it and issue a /pet guard here command.<br/>\nThen I can go loot the corpse without getting jumped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mistake I often made at first was going to find another mob and charming<br/>\nit to kill off the first pet.  The problem with this is that the first pet<br/>\nwill completely ignore second pet and attack me.  If I ran the second pet<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be in melee range, so I usually ended up zoning.  Now I just<br/>\nchain/fear my original pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been my experience that it&#39;s not a good idea to charm a magic user,<br/>\nespecially one that can heal.  It will heal it&#39;s opponent somewhere along<br/>\nthe way.  I&#39;m not sure if it does it before it can be recharmed or while<br/>\nit&#39;s charmed, I just know it get&#39;s the job done.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
