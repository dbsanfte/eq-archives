There will be lots of warrior types resting up on either side of<br/>\nthe zone line. Offer to group with them temporarily to help them heal.<br/>\nThis is a quick way to make lots of friends there, some of whom might<br/>\ndecide later that they&#39;d like a bard along just for the heal song.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo up and coming bards, try doing this even earlier, like L6 as so as<br/>\nyou get your heal song. The bard is a grouping character so, IMO, it&#39;s<br/>\nreally important you both learn to play in groups as early as possible<br/>\nand start building up a circle of friends who appreciate what a bard can<br/>\ndo as early as you can.
