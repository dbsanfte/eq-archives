The extras love to go for <br/>\nbards and will put you under fast. Don&#39;t be in puller group (ever). Normally <br/>\nwe will have a puller group, CC group (crowd control), and caster group. <br/>\nPuller is all tanks + cleric + monk puller. CC group is all enchanters <br/>\n(usually 2 or 3) + cleric + tank (to taunt mobs off enchanters while they <br/>\nmez stuff) + a druid or sham. Caster group is obvious. Cleric if possible in <br/>\nwith casters, otherwise use druids/shaman should be ok if nukers aren&#39;t dumb <br/>\nand nuke too early. Bards are in any group but pull group.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoison resist helping with Maestro is a myth IMO. Our fave Maestro strategy <br/>\nis to have a high level warrior tank the shit out of it with everyone else <br/>\non Maestro&#39;s backside to avoid the brunt of his lifetap proc (theories on <br/>\nthis abound, but we believe it is cone-shaped from the his frontside). You <br/>\nwant big nukes for this guy. Have nukers engage around 60% and drop him or <br/>\nat least get him to fleeing. Maestro should be pretty pissed at the original <br/>\ntank by then. If your casters nuke too early he will ping pong all over and <br/>\ngenerally rape your nukers and clerics, lifetapping everyone in the process. <br/>\nAs a bard, I found that instead of meleeing or singing resists, the best <br/>\nthing for me to do was to continually sing Jonothan&#39;s Provocation with a <br/>\nhorn on the main tank. Worked like a charm. We killed Maestro w/18 ppl <br/>\ntonight (not to mention the rest of Hate).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are meleeing, never use your autoattack key. For the time that you <br/>\nare in the planes, forget that your autoattack key exists. =) Always always <br/>\nuse only your assist key. You shouldn&#39;t be swinging your weapon unless you <br/>\nhit the assist key.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, if you are in Fear and Cazic Thule is up, good luck not getting <br/>\ndeathtouched. Bards have it bad there. =( Bards are kick ass pullers though, <br/>\nwhen Cazic is dead. Any mobs that can cause you to be deathtouched you <br/>\nshould hold off on singing til maybe halfway thru the fight. This includes <br/>\nDread, Terror, Fright, Dracolich, and Cazic. Even then expect to eat DT. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori{Legion}<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Mott, Mike J.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, I am almost ready for some plane hunting myself, and should be <br/>\n&gt;going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up in early November.
