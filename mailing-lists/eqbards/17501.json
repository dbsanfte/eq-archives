But it&#39;s also where you meet people who are just learning how to<br/>\ngroup (unless they are second characters but you can usually tell from their<br/>\nequipment.)  So, while you find groups, you will find some bad groups too.<br/>\nAlso, you are &quot;on the bottom of the food chain&quot; in these zones.  Meaning,<br/>\nyour level is low compared to the monsters and ther rest of the players.<br/>\nIt&#39;s also the first time you are meet mobs that hit really hard for their<br/>\nlevel thus necessitating groups to fight them.  And being a bard, you dont<br/>\nhave a lot of hit points to stand toe-to-toe with them.  So, at level 20,<br/>\nthe risk is high.  If you go in the late 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s (heck, I even<br/>\ndinged 39 there), you are stronger and more on top of the food chain.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther alternatives are:  Highkeep and Mistmoore.  Highkeep is popular and<br/>\nprobably crowded so you may need to pick different times of day to go there.<br/>\nIt requires groups (although you may see some solo fighters but they cant<br/>\nhold a room solo). You can bind in the zone - its a city. Mistmoore is a<br/>\ncrazy place.  Lots of trains that are very rough.  But low levels have a<br/>\nbetter chance here because there are spots off the train tracks (unlike<br/>\nCazic where the trains come right through the courtyard.)  If you can get a<br/>\ngroup and camp along the wall behind the lake, you can pull mobs to you and<br/>\nget good exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome ideas for you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Pollock &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjp@...\">jjp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 08, 2000 3:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Cazic Advice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just became a newly minted Bard of 20 songs, and have read (a Cleric<br/>\n&gt; guide, I believe) that I could start adventuring in Cazic.  The guide<br/>\nlisted<br/>\n&gt; as one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>\n&gt; group skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>\n&gt; before with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>\n&gt; level 20?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of<br/>\nrogues<br/>\n&gt; around, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>\n&gt; the Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you very much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dilvish<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 20 songs<br/>\n&gt; Povar Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
