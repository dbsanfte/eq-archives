Been busy getting things done in my current zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mynthi Davissi is an enchanter.  If it&#39;s a two man operation like I had and<br/>\n&gt; your Druid gets charmed, expect a couple of Starfires to hit you.  As a bard<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s your job to make sure that your Magic Resist is as high as you can get<br/>\n&gt; it when fighting her.  Even so, as John Kim noted some months ago he got<br/>\n&gt; charmed with his MR over 200.  Expect a charm or two to happen and be<br/>\n&gt; prepared to run for the zone creating one of those epic MM trains or die.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re in a larger group you can probably deal with a charm better than<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re in a smaller group.  My 50 Druid was charmed more than once.  Load<br/>\n&gt; Pixie Strike and be prepared to use it to interrupt Mynthi and other party<br/>\n&gt; members should they get charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBenoit St-Hilaire<br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsthilai@...\">bsthilai@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
