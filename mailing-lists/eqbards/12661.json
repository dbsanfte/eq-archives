This seems to <br/>\nsupport the idea that they simply have a higher-than average intelligence <br/>\ncheck against that spell, or that the &quot;random&quot; (hehehe) number generator <br/>\njust acted up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else I have noticed - bardic invisibility seems to be superior to <br/>\nany other single concealment spell (invisibility or invisibility to undead <br/>\nspells) insofar as it fails less often.  Many&#39;s the time I&#39;ve wandered Cazic <br/>\nor Unrest, dancing through the halls while around me monsters stood waiting. <br/>\n  I don&#39;t ever recall anything in either of those zones seeing through my <br/>\ninvis.  Could be that our invisibility has a lower-than-average intelligence <br/>\ncheck...<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
