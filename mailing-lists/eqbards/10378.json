I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; seen them for sale in all three places.  Krak sells them, as well.  To get<br/>\n&gt; Krak to sell to you, as dubious, use the &#39;sneak&#39; method.  Get a successful<br/>\n&gt; sneak going, and he will be indifferent to you.  Right click, and viola,<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; can sell/buy with Krak.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, for your brass skill...Get lots of food and water, then go to the<br/>\n&gt; Arena, off of Lake Rathe.  (Into the water from zone, off to the right,<br/>\n&gt; where an Avi is (sometimes) sitting on a dock, near two Chicken Huts).<br/>\nGet<br/>\n&gt; bound or not...doesn&#39;t matter.  Zone into the hallway, and step away from<br/>\n&gt; the zone, to be nice to all the fine folks coming here to get bound.  Have<br/>\n&gt; DDD memmed up, equip that horn, and start...c&#39;mon, start...i mean<br/>\n&gt; start...after all those missed notes, get DDD started.  Sit or stand,<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, now IRL, go away for a while.  Go to bed, go to work, go get<br/>\nsomething<br/>\n&gt; to eat...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From one practice point in brass (which should have given me a skill of 12<br/>\n&gt; (lvl 11 + 1 practive point), since I put my point into it when I could) it<br/>\n&gt; took me approximately 4 hours to max my brass skill at 95 for level 18<br/>\n&gt; (5*lvl + 5).  I have heard of some doing it in closer to 2 hours, and some<br/>\n&gt; taking longer.  IF you did NOT put a point into brass at 11, and waited<br/>\n&gt; until 18th, your skill increases will be faster, since you don&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; overcome those hard-to-get 7, and may shorten the time required immensely.<br/>\n&gt; If you put alot of practice points into it, it should reduce the time as<br/>\n&gt; well.  Due to the clumpy number generator, though, these times may vary<br/>\n&gt; greatly, just due to lags in improvement and large jumps in improvement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other areas, which I don&#39;t consider to be as safe to do this:<br/>\n&gt; Far back in the cave behind Shady Swashbuckler, in East Commons  (someone<br/>\n&gt; could screw up, attack him, and lead him your direction)<br/>\n&gt; Newbie area, out by zone line - sitting near one of the zone lines in<br/>\nfront<br/>\n&gt; of the gates of a city - again, someone could drag a guard out far enough<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be affected, and they kill quick.<br/>\n&gt; Just over zone line from WFP into NRO.  Dark Elf - &#39;nuff said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All in all, Arena seems to best place to do this.  Only players there, and<br/>\n&gt; usually only those coming to bind.  Just step out of the way, maybe around<br/>\n&gt; corner, and no-one will notice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good Luck<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; MacGrough<br/>\n&gt; 19th Song Bard and PROUD owner of his first Lambent armour<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 20, 1999 7:43 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] The old brass problem<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;chris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the reason there is unfinished horns is the same reason why<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are lute strings. as you may know there has been rumors that there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill we will get eventually if they ever get it working that allows us<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; create instruments. Problem is going to krak the aviak merchant is I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dubious to him. So I guess Ill just have shout out for someone with<br/>\n&gt; faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to look for me.
