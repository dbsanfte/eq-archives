Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash, <br/>\n1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to <br/>\nkeep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise <br/>\na few points each level and then stop. Does this skill <br/>\ncap lower per level than the other weapon skills? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Yes, I am pretty sure it is something like 3x per <br/>\n </span></blockquote>level and there is a cap around 40 or so.  Others can <br/>\nconfirm this as I can&#39;t find the old message.  I wish <br/>\nI had kept my H to H up, at level 17 it&#39;s pretty <br/>\ndangerous using it a low level.  As you  get higher it <br/>\ngets harder to max out your weapon skills. you might <br/>\nwant to pick two to concentrate on. (any else agree - <br/>\ndisagree?)<br/>\n     <br/>\nSecond question is about being interupted while <br/>\nplaying. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive <br/>\nme if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know <br/>\nmuch about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off <br/>\nafter a skeleton that conned white to me. I was <br/>\ninterupted alot. This had not really happened before at <br/>\nleast not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill what <br/>\nhelps prevents Bards being interupted like Channeling <br/>\nis to Magic user casting? If not what is? BTW I beat <br/>\nthe skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s the bash attack that Skellies have.  They are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>one of the first monsters that have bash that you run <br/>\ninto (like the warrior skill bash) and you should just <br/>\nget used to it.  It interrupts your song.  Nothing you <br/>\ncan do about it.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nThird (almost done :) on getting a new song about how <br/>\nlong is it level wise or skill wise before you can <br/>\ncount on playing that song well? Is there such a time? <br/>\nAnother thing that surprised me was that I mess up <br/>\nplaying that Heal song alot more than any of the other <br/>\nsongs I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As you go up in level the songs get easier to sing. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>So the most recently acquired song is always the <br/>\nhardest to start but gets easier as you level, ect., <br/>\nrepeat.<br/>\n     <br/>\nLastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5 <br/>\nfrom the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute <br/>\nas well. Is there a difference in these two for <br/>\nplaying purposes? Or are they just two options for <br/>\nstring instruments?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The effect seems to be identical (anyone?) but the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mandolin weighs a lot less so buy it if you can <br/>\nafford it since weight becomes critical when you <br/>\nstart getting heavy armor. (BTW, you want banded <br/>\narmor next and it&#39;s getting dirt cheap what with <br/>\neveryone going to plate and a surplus of smiths.)<br/>\n     <br/>\nMany thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Kobias<br/>\n     Lvl 6 Bard<br/>\n     Innoruuk<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">      &gt; Bujold  17th circle<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       Xegony ( and Happy at being able to answer a question for a <br/>\n     change....)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
