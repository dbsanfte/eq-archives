I only get the digest, so I have not seen anyone else&#39;s<br/>\nresponses to my questions(if there were any).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get to Velious - There is a new pirate and dock in North Ro just<br/>\nsouth of the Barb fisherman.  Hail him and he talks of ice, adventures and<br/>\nopportunity.  Ask What opportunity and he talks some more about ice and<br/>\nrelated topics.  I am camped in North Ro now.  In reading more of the 12<br/>\ndays, seems like levitate might be useful going among the Icy<br/>\nFingers(islands) when you first land in Velious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat race - My guild on The Nameless is aligning with the dwarves.  As<br/>\npeople who are home early get their CD&#39;s and log on, post to the list if you<br/>\nget the time how initial trip over is(and if from North Ro) and what<br/>\nmobs/NPC you can walk up to without getting attacked.  Can you bind at the<br/>\ndocks?  And any other useful info.<br/>\n<br/>\nLatest patches - Sense traps and disarm traps.  My opinion is we now became<br/>\neven more popular and should not lack for a group.  Unfortunately, since my<br/>\nskill in these suck(never used), I hope I don&#39;t kill myself learning.  What<br/>\nlevel do we get these(I forgot to check on my skills last night)?  Where is<br/>\na good place to practice disarm trap without getting killed?  How do you<br/>\npractice/activate it - do you target the trap or is it area effect or what?<br/>\nCan you do sense trap anywhere to build up its skill?  Any help on this is<br/>\nmuch appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTried to get my copy of SoV last night - no luck.  The EB clerk told me he<br/>\nwas having to fend off all the EQ addicts all day and that there was nothing<br/>\nI could do to talk him into giving out a copy yesterday.  The nerve - EQ<br/>\naddicts!  Well, maybe a little...  Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you in Velious,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 3<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 4 Dec 2000 10:40:23 -0500 <br/>\n   From: Cook Miller-ETOP03 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Scars of Velious<br/>\n<br/>\nDecided to move to an upcoming topic of many future digests - SoV.  I hope<br/>\nto pick up my copy today at EB in a nearby mall (preordered a while back and<br/>\nif not able to talk my way into a copy today, then tomorrow).  So, my<br/>\nquestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get there?  Reading the 12 days of Velious on the main EQ site,<br/>\nit seems to say Odus.  Here is the statement:  &quot;We have received recent<br/>\nreports from Ak`Anon that a new continent has been discovered.  New marine<br/>\ntechnology recently developed by the gnomes enabled the Ak`Anon Marines to<br/>\nbreak through the Frigid Barrier to the south of Odus and in doing so, they<br/>\ndiscovered lands previously unknown.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat race do you plan on aligning with?  I think my guild is going to<br/>\ndefinitely align with the Coldain Dwarves by initially killing giants.<br/>\nDragons will probably be left alone, at least for a bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone looked into the latest patches to see what they contain if more<br/>\nthan just new character models?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other good information out there?  Email threads on one of the forums?<br/>\nInside info from test?  Looking forward to finding out what you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
