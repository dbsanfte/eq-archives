That&#39;s all I could type<br/>\n&gt;  after being pummelled for 400 dmg.  Really get&#39;s the pulse<br/>\n&gt;  going...damn adrenaline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Speaking of exciting, I got the chance to pull Sir Lucan<br/>\n&gt;  last night.  About 12 people or so, all L45+ and they decide<br/>\n&gt;  I should be the poor loser who pulls him.  (I&#39;ve never fought<br/>\n&gt;  nor pulled him before, hell I had to actually track him to<br/>\n&gt;  locate his spot.)  Wouldn&#39;t you know, one roaming guard, two<br/>\n&gt;  posted guards, one Brother Gentry or something and Sir Lucan<br/>\n&gt;  himself.  3 closed doors, 1 winding passageway to make an<br/>\n&gt;  escape.  Yuck.  I had reso, words, symbol ~1900 hp.  Preparing<br/>\n&gt;  to get the worst beating of my life, I ran in opened two of<br/>\n&gt;  the doors, pulsed selo&#39;s, pixied lucan (just to get him pissy)<br/>\n&gt;  and made a run for it.  The paladins in the group were joking<br/>\n&gt;  about how they&#39;d watch me slowly lose hp and die.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  No such luck for them.  I think Lucan&#39;s personal guard hit<br/>\n&gt;  me once for 100, and Lucan himself hit me for double 75 -<br/>\n&gt;  only after warping ontop of me.  I beat them out of the<br/>\n&gt;  guard house so fast that they warped after I cleared<br/>\n&gt;  the front gates (smooch smooch battle drums).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  During the Lucan fight, I tossed everything I had at the guy<br/>\n&gt;  and right before the party wiped him out, I zoned out.  Was<br/>\n&gt;  a pretty fun night, and I still can visit the bard guild in<br/>\n&gt;  Freeport &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
