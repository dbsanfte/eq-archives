However, at the end<br/>\n&gt; of the night, the gm<br/>\n&gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining<br/>\n&gt; the situation.  Hopefully<br/>\n&gt; that will help matters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The character who actually stole it was Razel,<br/>\n&gt; although he said it was his<br/>\n&gt; &quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole<br/>\n&gt; the items.  I am told<br/>\n&gt; that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken<br/>\n&gt; advantage of as well but I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t know what to believe.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The funniest part of the story is that Razel<br/>\n&gt; actually gave a friend of mine<br/>\n&gt; all his druid items for me to hold as collateral. <br/>\n&gt; However, when my friend<br/>\n&gt; tried to trade them to me, one of the items was a<br/>\n&gt; full LIght Burlap Sack<br/>\n&gt; (which is lore).  When we hit trade, the items in<br/>\n&gt; the bag and the bag itself<br/>\n&gt; poofed.  And of course the gms won&#39;t believe this<br/>\n&gt; either - they say my<br/>\n&gt; friend kept the items but I know he did not.    So,<br/>\n&gt; now I will have to<br/>\n&gt; replace all this guys items as well.  I&#39;m told that<br/>\n&gt; there is a fairly well<br/>\n&gt; known bug with lore containers poofing but I did not<br/>\n&gt; have any knowledge of<br/>\n&gt; that before...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway thanks for the support friends :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tani/Hally<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM&#39;s will help with the bags of stuff disappearing<br/>\ndurning a trade. Just state to them that you traded<br/>\nthe bug of stuff, please specifiy to them exactly what<br/>\nwas in the bag. Also make sure and tell them that you<br/>\ndid not set the bag on the ground. It is a known bug<br/>\nto the GM&#39;s that this is happening.<br/>\nThis happened to me the other night, and the GM<br/>\nreplaced everything in the bag except for one item.<br/>\nThis was much more than I had expected and was very<br/>\npleased that I got anything back at all.<br/>\nGood luck all and remember, the GM&#39;s may surprise you<br/>\nonce in a while:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sing<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
