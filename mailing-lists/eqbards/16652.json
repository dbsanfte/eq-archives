Actually you might as well<br/>\nbe right though.  From the parsings I&#39;ve done a mob will. regardless of<br/>\nlevel, hit you for 80% of its max or more 80% or so of the time it hits you<br/>\nfor more than 1.  As you go up in levels you should see more misses and more<br/>\nhits for 1, at least thats what my logs have shown so far.  The amount of<br/>\nhits I see between 1 and 80% of max hasn&#39;t changed much for most mobs<br/>\ndespite gaining 12 levels since I started checking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 22, 2000 12:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] UPDATE 2 - we&#39;re getting there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>\n&gt; appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>\n&gt; teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>\n&gt; per hit. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Giants have and will always hit for ~96 dmg.  Your level makes<br/>\n  little difference in the amount of the attack.  Yes, they miss<br/>\n  you a lot more often, but a L42 ice giant&#39;s consistant hit is 116,<br/>\n  it was 116 when I was L14, and it still is 116 at L50.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Regardless of level the monster will strike usually in the upper<br/>\n  80% of their damage range unless they outright miss you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
