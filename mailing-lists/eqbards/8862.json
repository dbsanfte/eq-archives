Usually a goblin or three at the<br/>\nhole in the wall.  Just past it at the ledge, there are 2-3<br/>\nmore goblins.  Jump down to the door.  Open the door, 2 more<br/>\ngoblins.  Next door opens to a room with a gate.  2-3 more<br/>\ngoblins.  After that it&#39;s a bunch of long hallways straight to<br/>\nthe king room and Sol Mage room.  There is (AFAIK) one Sol<br/>\ngoblin that wanders these halls, but they&#39;re otherwise<br/>\nclear.
