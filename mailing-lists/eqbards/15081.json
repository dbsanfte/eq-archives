And most humans have <br/>\n&gt;found a way to deal with the night vision by lvl 24,<br/>\n&gt;unless there is a recent death involved...  That&#39;s what I mean when I say <br/>\n&gt;useless...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm I do not think the recently deceased Human who is bumping around in the <br/>\ndark would agree with you here...  Also people with dark video equipment <br/>\n(graphics card and/or monitor) find this useful as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There is no doubt alot of our songs are specialized, like the psalm &gt;series <br/>\n&gt;and such... but, there are about 6 uselss -  they are TOO specialized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MMM,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In Dueling and PvP this song is great.  Also handy to quickly get down from <br/>\nvery high places without dying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Disenchanting,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This song is useless so 1 point for you. :p<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Identify<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try to complete the Lambent armor quests without this one.  Also i have a <br/>\nfeeling that many more quests will have items in the future that need to be <br/>\nidentified.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;jump right to mind, am I to toss the lvl 24<br/>\n&gt;song into that same heap now?  Can they be used, yes... are they<br/>\n&gt;useful - I have not found them useful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because you find something useless does not mean the rest of us do.  I <br/>\nknow of people that even find Disenchanting Melody useful.  Usually in a <br/>\nMelee heavy group without a buffer from what I have heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I just think that if Verant is gonna limit our songs to 50, and then<br/>\n&gt;not really implement 50... that there shouldn&#39;t be that many lemons...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kerouac Dharmabum<br/>\n&gt;lvl 34<br/>\n&gt;Rodcent Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
