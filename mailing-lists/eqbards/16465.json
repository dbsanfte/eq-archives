I suppose it<br/>\ndepends on your usual groups, but I tend to keep getting groups with no Rangers or Druids, and trust me,<br/>\nChains is a LOT better than nothing.  I usually don&#39;t bother to throw until they start to run, unless<br/>\nwe&#39;re in real train danger (I use Largo&#39;s in battle).  Heck, last night I was with 2 Rangers in the Sol B<br/>\nKing Room, we pulled several multiple-MOB groups, and I had to Chain to stop the stuff at the end.  And<br/>\nthese are level 45+ Rangers, mind you.  Better to cover yourself.  As with all our songs, it works better<br/>\nthe higher-level you are, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, although I missed Charming two Giants against each other (never had the patience to find two of them<br/>\nat once), I&#39;m now Fear/Chaining single SGs, Specters and kobolds.  A little tedious, but better than no<br/>\nexp!  I fear/chained Terrorantula last night, even.  Note:  Fear has such a small radius, that you have to<br/>\nstand right *under* this spider to make it work.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 46 songs, Innoruuk  (woo hoo!  planes capable!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - And yeah, my guild refers to the Necros in the guild as &quot;BS Necros&quot;.  I took it as a mark of pride to<br/>\nbe referred to as a &quot;BS Bard&quot; the other day.  hehe.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
