If you think it would generate some<br/>\nintersting conversation, by all means post it there.  (Just make sure I get<br/>\n50% of all the royalty checks, hehehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have given a decent amount of though to the repercussions of the &quot;horse&quot;<br/>\nidea.  I don&#39;t think it would affect druid&#39;s and wiz&#39;s too much.  They would<br/>\nnot take the place of boats (which I hate too, but thats another story).<br/>\nThey only would go to zones on the the continent you are currently on.  I<br/>\nthink they are pretty wedded to their idea of putting distance between<br/>\nvarious continents (I somewhat agree with them here, somewhat).  The horses<br/>\nwould be limited.  Probably only originate in cities and end in outdoor<br/>\nzones.  Perhaps on Antonica (where their is some business for druids/wiz&#39;s<br/>\nporting across the continent), they could be limited to something like a 4<br/>\nzone radius. Something to keep it from stepping on the porter&#39;s toes too<br/>\nheavily.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
