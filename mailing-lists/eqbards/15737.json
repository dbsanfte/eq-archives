Hit the MS website and found 2 hot fixes<br/>\navailable for download :)  After installing EQ I launched it and got a<br/>\nmessage saying that no 3D device was found.  So I headed over the the Nvidia<br/>\nwebsite and downloaded the newest W2K drivers for the TNT-2.  Installed the<br/>\nNvidia reference drivers and it fired up just fine.  I am having some sound<br/>\nproblems though.  The sounds are way too load, esp in 3D sound mode.  It is<br/>\ndo bad I have had to bump my sounds realism down to shut off 3D sound, as<br/>\npeople walking by me are deafening.  I checkd the SB Live! site and there<br/>\nare no new drivers yet for W2k.  Overall it was a pretty painless upgrade<br/>\nand it installed alot faster then I thought it would.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
