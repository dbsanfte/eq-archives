I have a Diamond Viper V550 RIVA<br/>\nTNT card and was using the most current Diamond drivers for the card.  I<br/>\ninstalled the Nvidia Detonator drivers at the recommendation of Verant Tech<br/>\nSupport (thats right, they actually responded to my email).  I have had no<br/>\nproblems with lockups since I installed the Detonator drivers.
