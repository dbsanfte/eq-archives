Thats actually one of the more<br/>\nimportant ones =)  I&#39;ve been kiting yellow gorge hounds at level 15 (just<br/>\ngot 16) and wasn&#39;t able to tell if weaving selos/bellow/cod was better than<br/>\nselos/bellow/bellow (using strings).  Any help is appreciated...oh, anyone<br/>\nknow if I would be able to kite griffawns like this?   I hear they run the<br/>\nsame speed as hounds, and I never actually get hit while kiting...I just<br/>\nsorta run around in a circle to the beat of my own footsteps =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nTaluvil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
