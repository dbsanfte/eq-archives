In fact,<br/>\n   I dont give two hoots about adjustments to the snakes in <br/>\n   Qeynos Hills, I wanna test out SolB and LGuk changes.  I <br/>\n   wanna experiment with higher level songs that they tweak.<br/>\n   I want to make sure that they dont break songs that work<br/>\n   normally when trying to tweak other game elements.  Being<br/>\n   a level 1 bard, that would be hard to do.  Plus, I&#39;ve got<br/>\n   a few level 10 characters on the TestServer from GM buffing,<br/>\n   but that&#39;s the farthest I&#39;ve been promoted to on there.<br/>\n<br/>\n   How would you all suggest that I get my current bard&#39;s <br/>\n   data transported over to the TestServer and offer myself<br/>\n   up to test various game elements.  I&#39;m keen to the logistics<br/>\n   of the game, I know most of the formulas, most of the expected<br/>\n   effects of things.  I know the zones fairly well, I am well<br/>\n   versed in ways people skirt obstacles, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The problem is where do you start?  Who do you contact?<br/>\n<br/>\n   I think it would be sweet to get a handful of bards on <br/>\n   our respective servers to duplicate their characters<br/>\n   onto Test and work out a few things for Verant, since <br/>\n   their Q&A is lacking badly.  I wouldnt mind spending an<br/>\n   hour a week, just farting around with new changes on the<br/>\n   server.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Being level 1, or even level 10, doesnt offer much for<br/>\n   testing anything out.  Hell being level 25 really doesnt<br/>\n   either, since most of the songs they tweak are above that.<br/>\n   I&#39;d love to test the new songs when they decide to implement<br/>\n   them.  Play around with them, give feedback.  After all,<br/>\n   it&#39;s too late to check them out once they are live.  And<br/>\n   I&#39;m convinced /feedback -&gt; /dev/null.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
