I found him,<br/>\ncomepletely by accident in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron one<br/>\nnight. A friend and I were leaving unrest. I was 18th<br/>\nlevel, she 21. He promptly killed both of us, twice.<br/>\nOnce when we wandered into him, and once when we came<br/>\nfor our bods. I had no clue what he was then, or how<br/>\nrare he was. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
