Like when you are waiting for the last<br/>\nteam member to arrive. We used to just join up and head in at this point and<br/>\nalways ran into a shroom train. Now we camp out (EVERYBODY thx bard agro<br/>\ntransfer) right before going in and voila, havent seen a shroom since (well<br/>\ntill we went actively looking for them anyways :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote the above info might be pure bull sheet and just random luck on our<br/>\npart... hardly scientific :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 54 sucks. Mah god it was painful. Finally made 55 and lemme tell you, i<br/>\nwoulda rather gone through 51-53 again than 54. Though the new xp patch<br/>\nhelped a ton, before it was just too painful to contemplate. Anyways 55<br/>\nseems to be a lot easier, i am already half a bubble into it after just a<br/>\nfew hours pulling like mad in skyfire with a rogue/necro to back me  up :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 55 Bard of Talisman, Tunare.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 25, 2000 11:32 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Exp & Seb question -- was Re: AC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not bad in a group with everyone higher level than you.  i think<br/>\n&gt; before the patch it took me about 4 hours to get half a bubble, and the<br/>\n&gt; other night i got 3/4 bubb in the same time.  but now in 54 it is just<br/>\n&gt; extremely slow, worse than 51.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L54 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Compared to what it was - yes, I guess so but I spent 8 hours<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yesterday in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sebilis with a full group (granted there were 2 54&#39;s, another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who became 54,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 53, 1 52 and me 51) for 1 bubble of exp.
