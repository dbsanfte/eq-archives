My<br/>\n&gt;question is where can my group and I hunt there (I&#39;m 21, the group<br/>\n&gt;ranges to 26) fairly safely?  (The idea is to be in the zone for a while<br/>\n&gt;and /auction WTB MM drum.  Anyone have a clue what those would go for?)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Khelan, bard of 21 songs<br/>\n&gt;GuildMaster Divided Loyalties<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMHO, Mistmoore is better with few people -- as long as you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave anyone incompetent trying to hunt the castle. The castle trains<br/>\nare what really kill you. We head for zone if we see anyone in<br/>\nsteel armor, or anyone hunched over out in the courtyard. That&#39;s castle<br/>\nstuff and WAY too high for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20, Anna and I are staying out in the courtyard (down the ramp from<br/>\nthe zone... There is a pathing problem trying to get things up to the zone<br/>\nthat makes that not a good place to fight. If you fight up on the hill<br/>\nnext to the lake, then you might manage to avoid attracting the attention<br/>\nof some of the castle trains if you&#39;re VERY quiet and lucky.) Occasionally,<br/>\nshe will try a pull, with a full group, of a glyphed from the graveyard.<br/>\nI do not know what level these are, but just one is a good fight for us,<br/>\neven with groups ranging up to about 25. It may depend somewhat on<br/>\nwhat classes are the various levels. You might want to start in the<br/>\ncourtyard<br/>\npulling from the graveyard, and only move to the graveyard if you&#39;re<br/>\nhandling that<br/>\npretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, the last time we were in Mistmoore, the 25 druid/paladin team with<br/>\nus<br/>\nwas anxious to move to graveyard. We chose not to because Anna and I were<br/>\nnot comfortable enough with survivability there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 15 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Freeport)<br/>\n/<br/>\nMeara, level 15 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&lt;lvl 5 paladin&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
