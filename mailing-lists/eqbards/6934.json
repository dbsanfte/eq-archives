This comparison is silly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you wish to nitpick, then you are correct. We&#39;re<br/>\nnot casters. But we have the equivilant of spells<br/>\nin our songs. We get *one* &#39;mystical power&#39; per level<br/>\nwhereas other characters get *multiple* &#39;mystical<br/>\npowers&#39; per level. These &#39;mystical powers&#39; are the<br/>\nbackbone of our class just as they are the backbone<br/>\nof the other classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that fit your requirements a bit better? The<br/>\ncomparison isn&#39;t silly at all. We only get one<br/>\nsong per level. It would be nice to have that only<br/>\nsong be worthwhile. The poster I replied to was<br/>\ncomparing a caster having a useless &#39;power&#39; to our<br/>\nhaving a useless &#39;power&#39;. I was pointing out that<br/>\nwhen we have a single useless &#39;power&#39; it&#39;s not the<br/>\nsame as a caster since they get more of these to<br/>\nchoose from than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing silly in that.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
