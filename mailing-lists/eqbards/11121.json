Perhaps Verant decided that having an already up and running<br/>\nAccelerando break Root was not unbalanced, as it would no longer be a get<br/>\nout of jail free like it used to be.  The only time this feature would help<br/>\nyou ws if you were already running away when you were Rooted, or you were<br/>\nRooted by a hidden caster while you were running.  Heck, physical damage now<br/>\nhas a chance to break Root, you gonna suggest that&#39;s an exploit and anyone<br/>\nwho&#39;s Root is broken by getting smacked or blasted should just stand there<br/>\nand take it despite becoming unRooted?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: M Sanford (Maev) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 1999 4:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Un-Broken Song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;M Sanford (Maev)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis IS a bug.
