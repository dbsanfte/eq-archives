No one forces them to do a /guildremove!  I was one of the orginal members of a guild on Innoruuk called &quot;Higher Arts of Arcane&quot; (sp)   I left that guild in a heart beat when it came time to group and &quot;guild members&quot; come first!  though I played with the party more than 3 weeks straight and got bumped because of guild rules!  Now, instead of bitching about the guild rules, I dropped the guild I was in and joined all my friends guild.  Immediately I got things that I have been struggling to get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point. YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PLAYER STEALING.  It is a choice.  Yes, My x-guildmaster had a problem. It was quickly solved after I took anonymous off and he was nearly 20 lvls below me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Papa Legba <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 11, 2000 3:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [eqbards] Race to 60 (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ahhh we have gotten to another peev of mine...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Guilds stealing players.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This term makes no sense to me.  How do they steal a player?  DO they<br/>\n  sneak into your guildhall in the middle of night, creep into DuckFoo&#39;s<br/>\n  room, hold a nocked Ashenwood bow to his head and tell him to leave?<br/>\n<br/>\n  No?<br/>\n<br/>\n  They convince DuckFoo that joing their guild is better for him than<br/>\n  staying in his old guild.  DuckFoo then decides that the gains for<br/>\n  joining the new guild outweight the loyalty he holds to old guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wheres the problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Its with DuckFoo or with his old guild.  Either DuckFoo is leaving<br/>\n  behind good friends, and trustworthy companions for the allure of more<br/>\n  power.  Or, his old guild was not providing him with what he wanted from<br/>\n  a guild.  In the first case I say &quot;Shame on DuckFoo, and you deserve<br/>\n  whatever happens to you.&quot;  In the second, I&#39;d say its a good thing<br/>\n  DuckFoo left and everyone is probably better off.  I don&#39;t see where the<br/>\n  new guild has done anything wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you aren&#39;t getting from a guild what you want, then you should<br/>\n  leave.  All the better if its to a guild which will give you what you<br/>\n  want/need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I want to be in a guild with people I like and I&#39;m friends<br/>\n  with.  Hopefully also with a decent amount of people my level, so I can<br/>\n  more esaily find groups.  Other people may want other things.<br/>\n  -- <br/>\n  We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Matt DeBarger<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
