But DS is pretty insignificant.  By that<br/>\nI mean during those 3 minutes of Puretone, 1 rogue would have doubled<br/>\n(or more) the damage of the DS you created.  Overall if the whole raid<br/>\nis DS&#39;d, like with the diamonds, it is free damage.  If a bard is<br/>\nsinging DS, they are not singing something else (yes I would be singing<br/>\nRondo too of course for the DS and ATK with epic), and again if they lag<br/>\nor die the DS is gone.  Sure the intent is to keep that rogue or that<br/>\nbard alive, if the rogue dies he is doing no damage.  But all things<br/>\nbeing equal, if you do keep both alive, the rogue has doubled or tripled<br/>\nthe damage the bard contributed with DS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you will not always have the equipment or people you want<br/>\nor need, I am just talking best case scenario, the most efficient way to<br/>\nkill what you are after.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaisi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 24, 2001 10:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, does the VP Mage Staff block Rondo or Psalms?
