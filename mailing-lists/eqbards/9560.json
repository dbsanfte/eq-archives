Qeynos Hills, which was the<br/>\nother undead spawn area, and Kithicor (to a lesser extent, were mostly for<br/>\nnewbies btw 4-7 level.  So said newbie in Qeynos heads for his normal<br/>\nhunting grounds and BAM, Varsoon the undying hits you for 47pts of damage.<br/>\nThese 4-7 level players in Qeynos have no other place to hunt. I think they<br/>\nhave a right to complain that they lost their hunting area.  RV residents<br/>\nstill have Misty Thicket so should have less to complain about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is whining about dying in a fair fight.  You know when you go into<br/>\nUnrest that you are taking your chances. But Q Hills? I am a level 15 Bard<br/>\nand made it safely through the Hills only because I had Selo&#39;s and my drum<br/>\nequipped.  Incidently, I zoned into the Hills and immediately got hit by<br/>\nVarsoon, and this was at about 3 p.m. EQ time on Monday.  It was crawling<br/>\nwith undead, so during the day there was no respite in the Hills!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d let you know<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean, Bard of the 15th Song<br/>\nCrimson Legacy<br/>\nTailor, Baker, Brewer, Smith and Beauty Queen<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Strange, I&#39;ve complained about dying due to all the undead spawns in Unrest<br/>\n&gt;at least a hundred times and no on ever listened, why now?  I can&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt;fight the undead in Kithicor (err that were in Kithicor) and I think its<br/>\n&gt;ridiculous to complain about dying due to them.  I traveled thru during the<br/>\n&gt;height of the undead rush yesterday and was never even hit.  A pity that<br/>\n&gt;people are so whiny because things are not easy instead of complaining<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;the things that are actually broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
