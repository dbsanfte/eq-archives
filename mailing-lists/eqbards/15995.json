I play a &quot;Ranger&quot; that I<br/>\ncreated.  He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>\nFAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>\nare supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>\nyards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for secure trading that IS an issue but then again I was never a big fan<br/>\nof &quot;secure&quot; trades.  I&#39;ve never been rooked and items are pretty easy to get<br/>\nso most people don&#39;t bother trying to run a scam.  Remember, this isn&#39;t<br/>\nevercamp.  You can get the same nice items as anyone else from totally<br/>\ndifferent places.  You don&#39;t have to camp mob XYZ to get item WWW anymore.<br/>\nSo the &quot;secure trading&quot;, while an issue, doesn&#39;t seem to be as big a factor<br/>\nas it is in EQ (where you have to camp 24+ hours for some items at a camp<br/>\nthat has waiting lists 36hours  long)<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I&#39;d say they both have pro&#39;s and con&#39;s.  As I said, I haven&#39;t quit<br/>\nEQ but if I don&#39;t see any of my friends who I play with online I head<br/>\nstraight to AC.  (Did I mention I can have ICQ up in the background and<br/>\nALT-TAB to it if someone buzzes me to get my but on EQ? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKinda nice.  And worth taking a look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Will Day [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willday@...\">willday@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, March 12, 2000 8:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Trying out Asheron&#39;s Call (Way off topic but I<br/>\nhad to post this)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Will Day &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willday@...\">willday@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA short time ago, at a computer terminal far, far away, Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Last year I tried out Asheron&#39;s Call beta and really hated it.  The<br/>\n </span></blockquote>graphics<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;sucked, the interface was kludgy etc.  So when final came along I didn&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the game.  I was totally un-impressed.  Needless to say my tune has changed<br/>\n&gt;now.  I tried it out this past two weeks while I was on a business trip...<br/>\n&gt;All I can say is &quot;I&#39;m impressed&quot;.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the nitty<br/>\n&gt;gritty but I&#39;ll post some of my impressions that I got from the past 2<br/>\n&gt;weeks....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I picked it up last weekend when it was $25 at Best Buy.  To answer the<br/>\nrecent question: yes, you get a free month.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been fixed, why<br/>\n&gt;it was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The detail in the update reports did impress me quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost verything else you pointed out was pretty nice, too (landscape<br/>\ngraphics, dynamic world, skill sets, less paranoia of players advancing).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the character appearance, though, I have to agree with another post I<br/>\nsaw somewhere: it&#39;s a nice idea, but you rarely ever see people&#39;s faces, so<br/>\nit&#39;s a lot of design effort gone (mostly) to waste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>\n&gt;reported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.  There&#39;s not a<br/>\n&gt;single bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, this is what killed it for me:<br/>\n - no secure trading (did they never play Diablo?  how long ago was that?)<br/>\n - no banking (everything is on your person, or on player named &quot;Will&#39;s<br/>\nMule&quot;)<br/>\n - the first-person mouselook is entirely unusable.  There&#39;s no mouse<br/>\n   acceleration setting, and the horiz and vertical are fixed at entirely<br/>\n   different settings, so turning is slow, but your head keeps snapping up<br/>\n   to the sky or down to the ground.  Then, if you move forward and try to<br/>\n   turn while running forward, it _stops_ and does the turn, and you have<br/>\n   to press &#39;forward&#39; again.  Entirely, utterly, unusable.  You have to<br/>\n   play the game third-person, with the keyboard, which completely kills<br/>\n   any immersion factor for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m not entirely convinced on the better support from listening to<br/>\nplayers; I&#39;m sure these have been reported over and over since the beta<br/>\nstarted, and are pretty major design flaws IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things I&#39;ve heard about but didn&#39;t get far enough to see:<br/>\n - no group health display<br/>\n - unbalanced heavily towards magic and archers, and against melee<br/>\n - no guards, so people can have fun pulling monsters into the town square<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nWill Day     &lt;PGP mail preferred&gt;     OIT / O&E / Technical Support<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willday@...\">willday@...</a>            Georgia Tech, Atlanta 30332-0715<br/>\n  -&gt; Opinions expressed are mine alone and do not reflect OIT policy &lt;-<br/>\nThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary<br/>\nSafety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.<br/>\n    Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania Assembly, Nov. 11, 1755<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
