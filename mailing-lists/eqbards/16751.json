What is the other?  I had let my pierce skill<br/>\nslack quite a bit, so I got out my dirk and a FS dagger.  That was the first<br/>\ntime I had used two piercers at one time.  With the quickness spell from an<br/>\nenchanter friend of mine, I was a quisinart.  Also I liked the rogue look<br/>\nthat it gave me.

Eventually I moved to<br/>\n2<br/>\n  slashing weapons.  And now at 36, I&#39;m back to 2 piercing weapons :)<br/>\n<br/>\n        Basically, once you hit 17, you&#39;ll be dual wielding the rest of your<br/>\n  life.  I don&#39;t know any bard that uses a shield (though it is possible)<br/>\n<br/>\n        Don&#39;t forget your 1h blunt also.  Mine is only about 120 now,<br/>\n  instead of 185 where all my others are.  It&#39;s just that to me, no 1h blunt<br/>\n  weapons are really that good, so I haven&#39;t really botherd with it much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
