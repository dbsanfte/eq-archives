Fennin Ro was the first server, and the one most of<br/>\nus spend time on. We have long debated how to handle this, and ultimately,<br/>\nwe are seeking qualified, interested people who will lead the Soerbaird<br/>\ninitiative on their home servers. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in the process of deciding how this structure would work, and any<br/>\ninput fellow bards (and even non-bards) have, would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of us have noticed with great interest the high quality of roleplay<br/>\nevents happening on other servers. During P4, it was concluded that Fennin<br/>\nRo would be *the* roleplay server. Much to our delight (and sometimes<br/>\ndismay) RP is just as strong if not stronger elsewhere. This is quickening<br/>\nour desire to work out the multiple server issue. That said, the reality is<br/>\nthat you have to be neither a Soerbard, nor a bard to contribute works in<br/>\nIona Hall (our public library).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you on other servers have an interest in leading the Soerbaird<br/>\neffort on your server, you should send email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:soerbaird@...\">soerbaird@...</a> or<br/>\nfill out a Soerbaird application on our web site.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and about the memorizing thing... this is an IC requirement. It&#39;s<br/>\ndifficult to type in your ballads quickly and without error in EQ - the goal<br/>\nbeing to not bore your audience with long lapses and tons of typos. The IC<br/>\nrepresentation of typos or long pauses are missed notes and forgetfulness<br/>\nrespectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dendall, Ollave of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 10:53 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] About The Soerbaird (delete if you aren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 26 May 1999, Scott Pickle wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As this was brought up publicly, I shall answer it publicly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - The entry fee is 10p not 100p Yeesh!
