There was a dark<br/>\n&gt; elf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;necromancer named Nixx Nenix roaming Paw.  I was just coming out after<br/>\n&gt; &gt;successfully defeating Shaman Ren Rex and saw a dark elf swimming.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over time<br/>\n&gt; (DOT).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out and the DOT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571 hit points at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level 19).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cwelenas, Minstrel of the 8th Chord<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Angarth Bladedancer, Warrior of the 21st Tier<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Periissem ni periisem&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; G4[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reply To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, July 23, 1999 3:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [eqbards] New NPC in Highpass?

I was camping the Mucktail<br/>\n&gt; site<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see<br/>\n&gt; messages<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard)<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; both<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM<br/>\n&gt; (oops,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; smiting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC<br/>\n&gt; before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be<br/>\n&gt; prepared<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to run.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; controlled<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; NPC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; CPT Tom Reece<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; G4 Maintenance Officer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 655-4978<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Enjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
