The simple fact<br/>\n&gt; is, pure casters cannot wear True Armor.  Hybrids can wear a limited subset,<br/>\n&gt; and Melee&#39;ers can wear all.  Do you refute this basic statement?

The classes<br/>\nrun the full spectrum.  Even the four categories I&#39;ve used<br/>\nabove are somewhat arbitrary, although I personally feel they<br/>\nare the most appropriate.  I wouldn&#39;t hold anyone to these<br/>\ncategories though, much less make an argument about what<br/>\nclasses should get what based on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
