We went in last night and got both! I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know a kylong bp dropped, never seen one, although it makes <br/>\nsense with bracers, arms, and legs dropping. I have the Trak bp so <br/>\nit&#39;s doubtful I would be interested in a kylong bp. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was joking about the Breastplate, hehe, I figured you were there <br/>\nfor the Mask. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve seen about 3 of the BP&#39;s while actually looking for Masks (2 in <br/>\n1 night :/) and they pretty much suck.  They&#39;re not horrendous, but <br/>\nthey&#39;re chain based and anyone who can wear it that&#39;s hunting in the <br/>\nWest Wing of HS more than likely has something better.  Oh, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re NO DROP, so it can&#39;t even make a nice parting gift to whoever <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t win anything all night!<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats on getting your mask the next time around. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne, I was thinking the same thing, heh, first time actually <br/>\nrunning in to you face to face.  And yes, the Boss of the West Wing <br/>\ndrops the Mask of Obtenebration, the Kylong BP, and rumored to be <br/>\nsome nice weapon, although I&#39;ve never encountered that.  Then again, <br/>\nthe Procurator is also rumored to spawn, and some nights I&#39;ve had a <br/>\nhard time believing that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
