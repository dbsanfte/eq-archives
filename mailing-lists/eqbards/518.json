But I got very lucky.  A really nice Ranger<br/>\nknew what had happened to me and vowed to get my body back.  He initially failed<br/>\nbecause it is just not possible for sub-god-level characters to get anywhere<br/>\nnear Meldrath without getting charmed or having Mino Guards attack them through<br/>\nwalls, but as I was leaving the area I got a message from the Ranger asking for<br/>\npermission to loot my corpse (corpses) and I eventually got back most of my<br/>\nstuff (he could not carry it all).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here is what you need.  You need someone who is resistant to Charm Person<br/>\nto get close enough to attract Meldrath or his gaurds&#39; attention and train them<br/>\nout.  Then you can go in and recover your body.  I know that is no small thing,<br/>\nbut it is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that sounds too risky or too difficult, Crushbone is probably the best loot<br/>\nnearby, but it is also a tough place to stay alive unless you are with a really<br/>\ngood group, and even then jerks may make life tough.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John Hosenberg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:waper9@...\">waper9@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After an unfortunate night in Steamfont with a wrong turn to Meldrath I lost<br/>\n&gt; my corpse permanently.
