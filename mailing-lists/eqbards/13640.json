He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>\n&gt; can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>\n&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>\n&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>\n&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>\n&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>\n&gt; understand the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I can, that&#39;s why I said &quot;if that poll is accurate.&quot;  I hope you<br/>\ncan understand. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven going by Brad&#39;s statement, if the majority of people have &quot;mid-level&quot;<br/>\ncharacters, they should get the majority of the attention, so the rest of my<br/>\nstatement still applies. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
