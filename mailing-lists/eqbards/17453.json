I&#39;ve got one character in this game. <br/>\n&gt; Me.  There isn&#39;t a <br/>\n&gt; prayer that I would buy the &quot;he can use it better&quot;<br/>\n&gt; argument in a pickup <br/>\n&gt; group, and seeing just how often players pick up and<br/>\n&gt; move between guilds, <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t even buy it at the guild level. Among very<br/>\n&gt; close, trusted <br/>\n&gt; friends, I&#39;ll do it, but even then only if it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t happen repeatedly. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even if I can&#39;t use the item effectively, it&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; a tradeable item <br/>\n&gt; that I can use to get something I CAN use.  And if I<br/>\n&gt; start to buy in to <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;he can use it better&quot; argument, I&#39;ll never get<br/>\n&gt; anything but <br/>\n&gt; instruments, and I&#39;ll certainly never have anything<br/>\n&gt; lying around my bank <br/>\n&gt; to allow me to trade up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I&#39;m good enough to be in the group, I&#39;m good<br/>\n&gt; enough to lotto for any <br/>\n&gt; item the group gets.  If they can use it better than<br/>\n&gt; I can, they can <br/>\n&gt; trade me something for it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a complete hard-ass about this, btw.  My<br/>\n&gt; first FG run, when the <br/>\n&gt; leader asked all melee types to lotto for mith arms,<br/>\n&gt; I rolled (to the <br/>\n&gt; annoyance of many) and won (to the even greater<br/>\n&gt; annoyance of many).  I <br/>\n&gt; gave them to my level 50 warrior friend.  But he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; given ME stuff, and I <br/>\n&gt; know he&#39;s not going to take them and sell them on<br/>\n&gt; EBay or anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
