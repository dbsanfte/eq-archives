Never used it<br/>\nwith my party nearby.  Lets assume your party is trying to move from Point A<br/>\nto Point B without getting into any fights.  There are five mobs along the<br/>\npath.  As the bard, you are up front and successfully Lament each mob in<br/>\norder.  The bard could make it easily.  What happens though when your party<br/>\ntries to move past them?  Will the mobs ignore the entire party or will the<br/>\nmobs attack them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m inclined to believe that the Lament effect is centered on the bard and<br/>\nthat anyone else who gets within the mob&#39;s aggro range will get attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be a moot tactic if your party was invisible.  However, against<br/>\nmobs that can see thru invis it may be a viable tactic if the Lament stops<br/>\nthe mob from attacking the rest of the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; How long does the effect of the Lament last after you sing it to the<br/>\n&gt; mobs?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Will I have to do it over again when I take on the next mob?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It lasts several minutes for me.  Others say it only lasts<br/>\n&gt; about 10 seconds.  Dunno, maybe charisma has something to do<br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used it to break up the king area in Permafrost solo.  The<br/>\n&gt; first time I tried it, I&#39;d lamented all the mobs on the floor.  <br/>\n&gt; I fought an elite guard down to below half health when a<br/>\n&gt; newly-spawned priest above us started healing it.  I charmed<br/>\n&gt; the elite and ordered it to attack the priest, only to watch<br/>\n&gt; in horror as it decided the shortest route to the priest was<br/>\n&gt; through all the floor mobs.  Of the four remaining floor mobs,<br/>\n&gt; only the patriarch (who was actually the most recently<br/>\n&gt; lamented) was activated by the guard&#39;s passage.  The rest were<br/>\n&gt; still lamented.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the guard, patriarch, and priest were enough to<br/>\n&gt; do me in.  :-P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
