One bard I spoke to claimed to<br/>\nhave tested Jig and that it would help mana regeneration with a drum but had<br/>\nno effect without!  Either sung or played Jig would short-out the<br/>\nmeditation, in such a case, but perhaps she was just lying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your theory is true, two bards playing Jig timed just right could wreak<br/>\nsome havok.  And what if a mage tried to meditate with four bards playing<br/>\njigs.  Could he ever even concentrate?

Also, playing Hymn of<br/>\n&gt;Restoration (which I think is 6 or 7 seconds) should do the same thing, but<br/>\n&gt;at a slower rate, since I think it&#39;s a bit slower on the pulses (could be<br/>\n&gt;wrong).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll try to get one of the mages in my guild to help me try this before<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;weekend, and see what the real effects are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Incidentally, if this is truly what is happening, it is probably a.) a bug,<br/>\n&gt;and b.) will not work for bard mana regen if we don&#39;t have meditate skill.<br/>\n&gt;It also means that a level 3 bard, with jig could group with a level 50<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mana<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;user, and cause the same, or almost the same, effect that any higher level<br/>\n&gt;bard could provide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It would probably be best if multiple people did independent tests, so that<br/>\n&gt;we don&#39;t skew the results.  So, any volunteers out there can test this.<br/>\n&gt;This is the method that I&#39;ll use...<br/>\n&gt;Have the mage expend *ALL* of his/her mana.  Time each pulse of medi, as<br/>\n&gt;well as length of time to regen.  Again have the mage expend all mana.<br/>\n&gt;Playing jig, time pulse of medi, time pulse of jig, and length of time to<br/>\n&gt;full regen.  Playing HoR, time pulse of medi, HOR, and total.  This should<br/>\n&gt;give definite results on timing, percentage gained, if any, etc. and so on.<br/>\n&gt;Please post results here, if you try this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MacGrough - 14th Song Bard<br/>\n&gt;of the Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
