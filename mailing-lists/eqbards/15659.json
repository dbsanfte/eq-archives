My guild was, by and large, migrated to the new Druzzil Ro<br/>\nserver from Fennin Ro.  There were a few very valuable members left behind<br/>\nthat we hope made it in the second wave of transfers last night..  we&#39;ll<br/>\nsee.  In fact a couple of guild officer&#39;s mule characters were left behind<br/>\nwith loads of runes, pages, gate potions, dragon loot, fbss&#39;s, ykeshas, etc.<br/>\nthat he had stored..  yech.  So I&#39;ve got to say this wasn&#39;t for the<br/>\nfaint-hearted.  I left a lot of friends on Fennin Ro and am going to meet a<br/>\nlot of high levels now that I&#39;ve never seen, but it&#39;s definitely<br/>\n*interesting*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server population thus far has peaked at 600, but that&#39;s going to change<br/>\nas people migrate from Xegony and Solusek Ro (?).  Anyhow, I must say that<br/>\nit&#39;s really eerie running from zone to zone and hearing no /ooc, no /shout,<br/>\nnothing.  Last night I ran through East Commonlands which is normally a<br/>\nhotbed of /auc activity and not one message went by other than &quot;Your feet<br/>\nmove faster.&quot; running from Nek to NRo.  There were I think 4 folks in the<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fought in the Frenzy Room of lower guk with only about 25 people in the<br/>\nzone.  There were frogs *everywhere*, and lguk was as truly dangerous as it<br/>\nwas supposed to be.  My guild&#39;s group did very well, although a couple of us<br/>\ndied once when I pixie&#39;d a frog that wandered in and our Shadow Knight<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have mana to root the one we were fighting.  It fled at 25% and made<br/>\nit to a couple of his buddies before I chained it.  Oops - so I learned to<br/>\njust assume that an Ogre SK with an INT of 73 is always oom.  I still used<br/>\nAE Binding and such in that particular area without difficulty though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild ran around and did a bunch of &quot;firsts&quot; for the heck of it.  First<br/>\nOracle Robe, first Nagafen kill, first D&#39;Vinn ass kicking, first Gix kill,<br/>\nfirst this and first that..  kinda fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, overall I would say that it&#39;s definitely a better place at the moment,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see if that holds true as others flee some of the other crowded<br/>\nservers...  If you have the opportunity to move and don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>\nclose ties to people on your existing server, you might give it a shot, but<br/>\nmoving an entire guild is definitely problematic and could easily result in<br/>\na smaller guild falling apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
