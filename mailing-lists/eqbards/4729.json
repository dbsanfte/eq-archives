Puzzled, he looted it and got all of his items back. He then<br/>\ncontinued on his way to the Karana&#39;s to meet back up with his friends.<br/>\nSuddenly he saw his corpse where he had actually died. Puzzled again he went<br/>\nto loot it. Everything was there. Again. Now he has two of everything he<br/>\npreviously had. (He had no Lore items).<br/>\n<br/>\nWonder how many people got something nice like that. Seems that this latest<br/>\npatch broke more things than it fixed. Last night it was raining, but there<br/>\nwas no rain. I haven&#39;t seen a Sand Giant in Ro or the Oasis all weekend.<br/>\nThere was a pack of no less than 30 Deep Water Goblin pets running around<br/>\nwith a Deep Water Goblin around the Oasis beaches and hills. You&#39;d think<br/>\nthat Deepwater Goblin pets would stay in the Oasis lake with their masters;<br/>\nbut they&#39;ve been running around the desert in the Oasis all weekend. Most<br/>\nannoying since there&#39;s no way in Norrath I&#39;m going to use an AE (Area<br/>\nEffect) song with the risk of hitting one of those nasties.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
