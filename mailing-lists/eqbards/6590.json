This is<br/>\na great place for it because it&#39;s a rarely used key and right beside all<br/>\nthe rest of your hotkeys. It was screwed up for a while due to Verant&#39;s<br/>\narbitrary mapping of the transparency toggle to it but they recently<br/>\nallowed that to be remapped so you can use it again. Of course I use the<br/>\nwasd keys for movement so this is even more convenient. Because I was<br/>\nused to UO where talking didnt require hitting return, the first thing I<br/>\ndid in EQ was move every configurable key off the letter keys. After<br/>\nattacking a shopkeeper of course. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
