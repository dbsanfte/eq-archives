This is perhaps the best<br/>\nnon-Planes item for Clerics, Druids and Shamans (AC 9, STA +5, WIS +9, AGI<br/>\n+9, MANA +5, SV DISEASE -5 and CHA -5).  I started the quest a few weeks ago<br/>\nbefore we knew about the Lambent quests :-)  A 50th Wiz on Fennin Ro the<br/>\nother night was auctioning for trade a MM Battle Drum.  I told him I was<br/>\nclose to completing the Paw and he offered to trade TWO sets of MM Battle<br/>\nDrums for the completed Paw.  A friend of mine that is familiar with the Wiz<br/>\nsays that he bought the drums on ebay, I dunno...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known that I&#39;ve camped<br/>\nPaw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my baking skill up as<br/>\nwell (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>\napproaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM Battle Drum<br/>\nwith my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 30, 1999 2:09 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] So anyone wanna trade...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if you have the mm drum, and you want a full set of rubicite for it...<br/>\n&gt; lunacy is a kind way of putting it =P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hmm, i guess it works the other way too, if you want to give away<br/>\n&gt; a full set<br/>\n&gt; of rubicite for a mm drum that would be a bit of insanity as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; recent examples...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i was offerred 7000pp and a molten cloak or my rubicite chest<br/>\n&gt; alone (really<br/>\n&gt; the only good piece of rubicite).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; at the freeport auction, a full set of rubicite WITHOUT the<br/>\n&gt; breastplate went<br/>\n&gt; for 10000pp and a mithril chest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, L24 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L24 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Manda D&#39;ulin, L20 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lange, Stephen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SLANGE@...\">SLANGE@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me a full set of Rubicite for my Mistmoore Battle Drum?
