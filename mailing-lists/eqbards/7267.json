I tried to duel a few<br/>\ndruids and shamans last night, and I said, oh and you cannot use<br/>\nany spells... pure melee.  No one accepted.  Thus showing how badly<br/>\nthey would get whupped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 19, high dual wield, and mostly bronze armor, my AC was<br/>\nover 500... There is nothing that cleric can wear that you cant.<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t an armor issue, you both can wear the same armor.<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t about dodge because as I recall clerics have close<br/>\nto the same dodge as us.  This isn&#39;t about defense because they<br/>\nhave about the same defense too.  You hp is extremely similar,<br/>\nyou may have a little lower hp, but not more than 10% difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this all boils down to is the Bard&#39;s ability to effectively<br/>\nwield two fast medium power slashing/piercing weapons.  Clerics<br/>\nhave no recourse in weapons, other than high dmg -or- high delay.<br/>\nMaybe this isn&#39;t as clear in the first 20 levels, but as I get<br/>\nclose to level 40, my melee is counting more and more, as I almost<br/>\nalways dual wield, and average about 20 - 25 total dmg per round.<br/>\nThat&#39;s nothing compared to a paladin or ranger, our other &#39;hybrid&#39;<br/>\nbrothers, who can do up around avg 40 - 60 total dmg per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith similar AC, hp, defense, dodge... and much much better melee<br/>\nskills and dual wield, I don&#39;t understand why this conversation <br/>\ncontinues =)   In fact it&#39;s becoming pointless.  We usually fight<br/>\nmonsters, not other druids/shaman/clerics. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 37th unchained melody.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
