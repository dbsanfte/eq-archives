Sure, I could still kite stuff where kiting was<br/>\nsafe, but there was no way I could stand toe-to-toe with a mob and<br/>\nbash it down, even twisting the best three songs I could think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was my armor, and I worked hard to replace all of my<br/>\nbanded with bronze plate.  By the time I accomplished that task, I had<br/>\nadvanced a few levels, and the mobs I wanted to take on were even<br/>\ntougher.  Around level 25, I had pretty much resigned myself to no<br/>\nmore soloing, unless I wanted to spend 15 minutes kiting some stupid<br/>\nbird for just a smidgen of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, with all of this talk about Screech lately, I decided to pull<br/>\nthat one out of the closet.  Now I find that with a combination of<br/>\nChains and Screech, I can take on those blues by myself again!<br/>\nWoohoo!  It&#39;s not toe-to-toe, but it&#39;s a lot more interesting than<br/>\nrunning around in circles.  Now I just have to find the places where<br/>\nthese guys hang out by themselves.  Hmmm...maybe those cyclops in the<br/>\nRathe Mountains will want to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPurna Hodari of Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
