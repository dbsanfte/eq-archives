Sure he died quite a few times and many of them<br/>\nbefore anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days with very little<br/>\nexp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand has officially<br/>\npassed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, 4 of those<br/>\ncamping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, which cutts exp<br/>\nin half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go from 1 to 54 for a<br/>\nnecro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the pally. How can this<br/>\nbe right?<br/>\n*********************<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just bards that have issues.
