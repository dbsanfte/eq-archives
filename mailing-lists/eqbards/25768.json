Personally I find EQ to be an AWFUL solo<br/>\ngame.  It&#39;s only the social aspect - and the interaction and strategy<br/>\nbetween the player classes that I find interesting - ESPECIALLY for the bard<br/>\nclass (where our strength is that we can fill in for so many other classes).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to solo - I fire up Civ3 - it&#39;s a MUCH better single-player game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that a lot of people will want to game for a 30-60 minute<br/>\nsession - and the difficulty of finding a group and getting setup precludes<br/>\nthat (especially if you are unguilded or in a small guild) - but again -<br/>\nthat&#39;s when I play some Civ3 (or whatever game it was in the past)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n58 (almost 59!)
