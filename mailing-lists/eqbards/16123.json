We&#39;ve tried to pull him from his island to Gorgalosk island,<br/>\nbut he always seems to get stuck inside his windmill.  We&#39;ve pulled the<br/>\nbladestorms without any problem, but haven&#39;t been able to get Dojorn to come<br/>\nout.  Have you guys pulled him?  Or is there something I&#39;m missing?  Also,<br/>\nhow many people did you have when you took him down?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
