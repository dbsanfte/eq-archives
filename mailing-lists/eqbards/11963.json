The range at which they give up varies from mob to<br/>\nmob.  Undead have a give-up radius too, but will attack any<br/>\ntarget they stumble across regardless of you being tops on<br/>\ntheir hate list.  So even if an undead is chasing you and you<br/>\nare close enough that they won&#39;t give up on you, if it happens<br/>\nto pass by another person, it will usually attack him instead<br/>\nof continuing to chase you.  Not-so-nice players take<br/>\nadvantage of this to dump unwanted undead onto others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you&#39;re pulling, sometimes you have to Selo-walk or<br/>\nSelo-run backwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
