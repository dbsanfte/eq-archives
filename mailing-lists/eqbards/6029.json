Even with Verants change to reduce the amount of xp you<br/>\nlose when you die, I still lost 1/3 of  a bubble dying to a stupid<br/>\nbasement train last night.  At least I got my level, though it took at<br/>\nleast another to earn it back =(.  Perhaps it is time to be less noble<br/>\nand more parts chicken.  It seems that I die more often when trying to<br/>\ncare people, perhaps it would be better to be known as Treilanin the you<br/>\nyellow bellied chicken .... Nah I think not =).<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
