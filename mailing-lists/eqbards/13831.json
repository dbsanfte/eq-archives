The proc is Life tap?  Necro bard hehe!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me it was more for fun.  Your BLW is a better wep.  Ashenwood short<br/>\nspear is good wep for the 20ish levels.  Less weight, as good or better<br/>\nratio.  Has 10 charges of haste (never used any of mine).  Looking to your<br/>\n30&#39;s I&#39;d suggest Staff o&#39; Writhing and Obsidian Shard (SoWr 48dd proc; OSh<br/>\n30dd proc).  I used SoWr and Dirk for a long time.  Should have gotten that<br/>\nOSh lots sooner.  By level 45 you want to be 2YK compliant but that&#39;s a<br/>\nreally hard prize to earn without some good (guild) help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 5:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Tentacle Whip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I noticed that during the Dual Wield thread, some of you fine Bards said<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; you use a Tentacle Whip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you feel that the low delay makes it viable?
