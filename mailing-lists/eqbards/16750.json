Not too dramatic..:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was wondering<br/>\n&gt;what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for 2 1h slashers<br/>\n&gt;or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hello!<br/>\nWell, you can arm a 2H slash but your skill will never go above 0...so<br/>\nprobably not a good idea *grin*<br/>\n I think the weapons you might want to be looking for now are a Mino Axe<br/>\nand/or a Dragoon Dirk. Mino Axes should be 3-5pp and are great weapons at<br/>\nyour age. Dragoon dirks go as low as 20pp and have better overall stats than<br/>\na Combine Longsword. At 26 I still use mine and even when I upgrade will<br/>\nkeep it in my throwing weapon slot just for the bonuses. Make sure you<br/>\npractice your 1H slashing and piercing as well, the combo of the two works<br/>\ngreat once you get Dual Weild. Once you hit high teens start thinking about<br/>\ngetting a Polished Granite Tomahawk from Highpass. This was the route I<br/>\ntook, knowing this list I be there is an even better approach I never<br/>\nthought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
