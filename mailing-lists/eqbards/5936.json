It&#39;s just that I seem to remember <br/>\n&gt;that Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you would <br/>\n&gt;still have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the <br/>\n&gt;&quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I hate to say it, and I know there&#39;s gonna be a bunch more deaths as<br/>\na result of this, but I&#39;m glad they implemented this change.  Sure, it<br/>\nnerfs our ability to help our teammates - but these are the same teammates<br/>\nwho were upset that we were overriding their SoW before during emergency<br/>\npeelouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;m not really happy about it - but I have a feeling it&#39;s a<br/>\nnerf-to-stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
