It was actually a very interesting post.  In a nutshell, the poster<br/>\nclaimed that because CH, when cast on warrior, is the most powerful spell in<br/>\nthe game, Verant had to balance the game accordingly to compensate.  In<br/>\nother words, Verant assumes that most, if not all groups, will have at least<br/>\none warrior and cleric in them, especially when fighting the tougher mobs in<br/>\nthe game.  In order to make sure the game was still challenging, the<br/>\ndifficulty of the game, i.e. mob toughness, had to be increased to<br/>\ncompensate for the warrior/cleric combo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe poster then went on to say that, had Verant never put CH in the game,<br/>\nand instead Superior Heal was the best heal spell in the game, then it would<br/>\nbe easier for everyone to form viable 6 man groups.  Groups would be willing<br/>\nto have paladins, rangers and shadowknights as main tanks.  Groups would be<br/>\nwilling to use druids and shamans as main healers.  Clerics would still be<br/>\nthe best healers, their Superior Heal being more mana efficient than<br/>\ndruids/shamans.  Additionally, Verant would not have had to increase the<br/>\ndifficulty of the game in order to compensate for the warrior/cleric combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course most of the replies to the thread were whiners screaming foul<br/>\nbecause someone was calling for CH to get nerfed, which wasn&#39;t the case at<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 1:09 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Numbers on Bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncomplete heal is the most powerful spell in the game.  but obviously a<br/>\ncleric needs to know how to use it along with their other heals effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada, 58 Bard<br/>\nAfterlife<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Agreed my point (which I didn&#39;t elucidate) I find a lot of <br/>\n&gt; clerics who seem<br/>\n&gt; to think that C Heal is the only heal they need to keep <br/>\n&gt; memmed and only heal<br/>\n&gt; when everyone gets that low.
