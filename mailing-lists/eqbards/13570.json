First, they haven&#39;t successfully implemented any<br/>\n&gt; new quests a 21st level bard can do in a very long time.  I&#39;ve tried a<br/>\n&gt; couple they did add to see if they might be viable, but both were broken so<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t even find out if they were of an appropriate level for me.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done every other quest, or gotten as far as I could in them, that I might be<br/>\n&gt; able to do.  <br/>\n&gt; On the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>\n&gt; deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too frequently<br/>\n&gt; to make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was there<br/>\n&gt; there were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>\n&gt; groups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>\n&gt; difficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded and<br/>\n&gt; most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>\n&gt; skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to S<br/>\n&gt; Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like you&#39;re on a 1800+ server, and thus a complaint about<br/>\nthat, rather than not enough places to go. If Verant had stuck to their<br/>\noriginal 1500 max per server (and dispite their denials I remember them<br/>\nstating this in beta. They shut down all the servers but one one day and<br/>\nasked us all to log in specifically to test if the server could take<br/>\nthat many) then you wouldn&#39;t have these problems. They now seem to be<br/>\nrelying on people sticking it out until the expansion when they can hope<br/>\nthat the current server populations will be more comfortable with the<br/>\naddition of the extra zones but personally I think their reluctance to<br/>\nput new servers online in a timely manner will hurt them in the long<br/>\nrun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
