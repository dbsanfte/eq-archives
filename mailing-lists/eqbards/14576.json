On the last raid the two magicians there were constantly summoning<br/>\nwaterstones in between fights.  Everyone had these hotkeyed in their main<br/>\ninventory for quick access.  Another option is the Fish Gill Extract potion.<br/>\nI think they run around 12PP each.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The fish there do drop scales, but not enough for you to rely solely<br/>\n&gt; on them, IMHO.  Fish scales can be purchased in bulk from one of the<br/>\n&gt; merchants near Inn 3 in the east commonlands (bat wings too).  A good<br/>\n&gt; idea would be to have a magician summon a couple of the appropriate<br/>\n&gt; rings or stones for everyone who doesn&#39;t have a Fishbone Earring or<br/>\n&gt; an Aqualung or a Rebreather.  That way they have something ready in<br/>\n&gt; case of an emergency.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I can&#39;t answer your question about bulk purchases but I do know a lot<br/>\n&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the fishes you kill in Kedge drop fish scales so it shouldn&#39;t be hard<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; rangers/druids to replenish their supplies while they are down there.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;     The talk of Kedge Keep has me very interested and my Guild Leader<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been planning an outing on ICQ.  The question is; short of<br/>\n&gt; fishing;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; where can Fish Scales be purchased in bulk?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finding a sweetheart is hard work.
