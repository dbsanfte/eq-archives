It seems the people who are having trouble with <br/>\nmissed notes on certain songs (Denon&#39;s Discord, Charismatic Carillon) have <br/>\nalso stated that the their skills in the required instruments for these <br/>\nsongs (Brass, Wind) are lacking.  There is a direct relationship between <br/>\nyour skill in the instrument needed for a song and your ability to start the <br/>\nsong, even if you are singing it not using the instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you first get Carillon you have awful wind skills, and the first wind <br/>\nsong you can play non-stop to build this skill is the Aquatic Aria (16th <br/>\nlvl).  So till you get to 16th and practice up wind to near max Carillon <br/>\nwill have a lot of missed notes.  Same with Denon&#39;s, at 18th lvl your Brass <br/>\nskill is near nil.  So trying to start DDD will be a major pain.  I noticed <br/>\nmy missed notes on DDD went down a lot when my brass skill got past 80 (took <br/>\na lot of practice time).  I know keep all my instrument skills maxxed or <br/>\nnear maxxed at every level and my missed notes are not that bad, but still a <br/>\npain none the less.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
