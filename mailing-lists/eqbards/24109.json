I guess I was being intellectually lazy.  The thing is, there are so few places where see invis is<br/>\nuseful, and those are so obvious to all the other casters, that they reflexively toss see invis on<br/>\neveryone else before I can bother to remem this song.  I&#39;ve had less practical use for this song than I<br/>\nhave for Melanie&#39;s Melifluous Motion.  I&#39;ll concede that saying it was &quot;pointless&quot; was an overstatement.<br/>\nBut still, it is by no means a strong addition to our song arsenal, particularly once see invis was added<br/>\nto invisibility.  Easily bottom 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reeves, Patrick W&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; *sigh* Did Kenross get sold on ebay?  To say that the needed change to the<br/>\n&gt; lvl 19 song (adding see invis) made the lvl 24 song pointless is about the<br/>\n&gt; stupidest thing I have read on this or any list.   Next time you need to see<br/>\n&gt; invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>\n&gt; when you pulse clouding to see invis.  Or maybe when you are fighting invis<br/>\n&gt; mobs in PoA or another zone and have to use your flute so your party can see<br/>\n&gt; the invis mob you are fighting. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
