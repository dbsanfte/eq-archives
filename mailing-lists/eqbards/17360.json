Since<br/>\nits No drop he can&#39;t sell it.  My rogue used 1 HS weapons for completeness,<br/>\nbut only until he got Backstab.  Since then I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even touched<br/>\nthe FS Scimitar in the bank.  Very odd.  Are the fangs not No Drop as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
