I had just zoned in and<br/>\na group was at the zone border fighting 5-6 ice goblins.  I starting singing<br/>\nlullaby with lute equipped.  I was not attacking any of the mobs.  With one<br/>\nor two exceptions for the entire fight, every time the song pulsed every<br/>\ngoblin was put to sleep.  I confirmed with their group leader that the party<br/>\nwas concentrating on one mob.  In theory, the others should have just stood<br/>\nthere doing nothing.  Instead, often 2-3 mobs would attack me even though no<br/>\none was attacking them.  If the lullaby affected them, it only lasted for a<br/>\nmicrosecond.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; DEV_01: &quot;I know, lets do it like we did Lucid Lullaby.
