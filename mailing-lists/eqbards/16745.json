Come on now, I do NOT want to be tied to my<br/>\nmanabar especially with as slow as our mana comes back.   I like a LOT of<br/>\nthe songs we&#39;ve proposed.  And I agree some do need a check/balance.  But<br/>\nwhy does it have to be something we cannot recover anywhere even remotely<br/>\nquickly?  Why not cost 1/2 health?  or 1 bubble of hp?  Why tie it to mana<br/>\n(which we are incapable of recovering)?  But, looking at these proposals.<br/>\nMost of the ones that have a proposal of X mana/tic cost really don&#39;t NEED a<br/>\ncheck of that kind.  Remember you&#39;re talking about limiting ALL our song use<br/>\nfor mana songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone else pointed out these are LEVEL 50+ songs.  We shouldn&#39;t HAVE to<br/>\nsacrifice anything to have these abilities.  I have yet to see a single<br/>\npowerful song here that would be &quot;unbalancing&quot; without manacost.  Ok, maybe<br/>\nthe time stop one was ;)  But the others?  Come on, these are nice abilities<br/>\nbut I&#39;d hardly call them abilities that will recharge about as fast as<br/>\npaladin layhands.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember:  1 bar of mana recharges SLOWER than SK harm touch or Paladin<br/>\nLayhands (both of which are horrendously powerful and are just _skills_,<br/>\nskills they get at level _1_).  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t dissagree that it would be nice to have 1, MAYBE 2 songs that will<br/>\nburn up our mana.  But our mana doesn&#39;t come back fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you honestly think we should have 4 songs (25%) out of the 13 we (should)<br/>\nbe getting require all our mana to be useful?  Seriously:  how many times<br/>\nare you going to use 1 pulse of a song... only 1 pulse mind you.  On all the<br/>\nsuggestions I&#39;ve seen 1 pulse = 1 bubble of mana.  So we&#39;re talking 200+<br/>\nmana<br/>\ncasting cost (for any bard).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, if we use mana for songs, given current bard mana recovery rates:<br/>\nI sing 1 mana using song till OOM (not really long given the rates of use<br/>\nproposed)  I now am incapable of singing ANY mana using songs until I<br/>\nrecover at least<br/>\nSOME of my mana.  1 bubble of mana for a bard is around 10-20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks but no thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bard, not a mage dammit<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ryan Honeyman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 24, 2000 10:15 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Umm... easy on the mana...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t propose mana costs in our songs unless you also propose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that our meditate cap be removed and our immunity to clarity effects be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; removed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I highly doubt they remove the meditate limit or give us the ability<br/>\n&gt;   to receive benefit from clarity type effects.  I think that was your<br/>\n&gt;   point anyway, it&#39;s not going to happen.  I agree that 75% of our new<br/>\n&gt;   songs should be manaless, just like the bulk of our songs now.  The<br/>\n&gt;   problem is, I&#39;m tired of just getting the &#39;next Anthem&#39; or the &#39;next<br/>\n&gt;   Heal&#39; or the &#39;next Resistance song&#39;.  Original ideas like the ones<br/>\n&gt;   I have seen are unique and very powerful.  They need a check put in<br/>\n&gt;   so that the Bard is not just constantly using these most powerful<br/>\n&gt;   songs.  I&#39;m not saying all songs take a full bar, or take 1 bubble.<br/>\n&gt;   Songs can taken 20 mana per tick, (20m/6s) = 300s worth of time at<br/>\n&gt;   full mana (~1000 mana), for example.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Songs like that sacrifice song are self-checking.  You die, your<br/>\n&gt;   party gains benefit.  Dirge is a joke, and I hate to sound like<br/>\n&gt;   a broken record but Dirge at L43 is the equivalent of a L20ish<br/>\n&gt;   wizard dumping full mana into AE.  The only thing desparate, again,<br/>\n&gt;   is the damage done.  This song takes up to an hour to mana cycle.<br/>\n&gt;   (And no, Shada, I&#39;m not a caster, I don&#39;t sit my bard down ever)<br/>\n&gt;   It takes an hour for 90%+ of the bard population to regain mana for<br/>\n&gt;   this song, because I know I have hidden my &#39;Sit&#39; button since I<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t use it.  Needless to say the song is a waste.  It requires<br/>\n&gt;   mana, but for the wrong reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   There was the rumor of a high level bard song which stopped time.<br/>\n&gt;   Something like that would absolutely take mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t want to be stuck with Verses of Victory II at L60.  I want<br/>\n&gt;   some very distinct songs, and I just get the feeling that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   going to happen.  Let&#39;s also assume Verant aren&#39;t complete idiots,<br/>\n&gt;   and we continue to receive one song per level.  Here is what I<br/>\n&gt;   predict:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   L51 - upgrade to hymm<br/>\n&gt;   L52 - upgrade to lullaby<br/>\n&gt;   L53 - upgrade to clouding<br/>\n&gt;   L54 - upgrade to some useless AE like DDD, LMB<br/>\n&gt;   L55 - upgrade to clarit<br/>\n&gt;   L56 - upgrade to psalm line<br/>\n&gt;   L57 - upgrade to charm<br/>\n&gt;   L58 - not implemented<br/>\n&gt;   L59 - upgrade to verses of victory<br/>\n&gt;   L60 - not implemented<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   It&#39;s sad, but I just don&#39;t see them doing anything that requires a whole<br/>\n&gt;   lot of effort.  Look at the other classes new spells, there&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt;   nothing new about them.  They are just upgrades to existing spells.<br/>\n&gt;   I couldn&#39;t find any really new power anyone was given.  Except maybe<br/>\n&gt;   that single target kill series, but that requires a gem component, and<br/>\n&gt;   then becomes extremely limited in use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So if I can get a song that makes me a badass at the cost of mana,<br/>\n&gt;   but gets me into more parties because of the talent, I&#39;m for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I think I&#39;m gonna sign with that DMB quote each time, it fits us<br/>\n&gt;   perfecly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;What I want is what I&#39;ve not got,<br/>\n&gt;    What I need is all around me.&quot;     -Jimi Thing, Dave Matthews Band.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
