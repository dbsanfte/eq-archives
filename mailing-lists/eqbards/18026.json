My <br/>\ncoordination and reflexes were never that hot (which is why I sucked at <br/>\nsports), and they seem to get worse with age.  Plus, I&#39;ve usually played <br/>\nturn-based strategy games.  And, in agreement with the &quot;can&#39;t teach an <br/>\nold dog new tricks&quot; axiom, I&#39;ve been playing this game in the default <br/>\nfirst-person mode, using the keyboard for everything but targetting MOBs. <br/>\n(It took me until level 40 to switch from using the mouse for song <br/>\nactivation to setting up hot keys, which shows you how stuck in old <br/>\nhabits I can get.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering how the rest of you play.  Do you use the other views, and <br/>\nif so, for what purposes?  I&#39;ve been playing with the mid-range <br/>\nthird-person view for soloing for about a month, but I&#39;m having a lot of <br/>\ntrouble using it in group situations.  Does this just take practice?  <br/>\nDoes anyone use the &quot;behind the back&quot; view for any reason other than <br/>\naesthetics?  My avatar constantly gets in the way on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, do you use your mouse for movement?  Do you actually feel that you <br/>\nhave better control than with the keyboard, or is this the inverse of my <br/>\nsituation (e.g., you always used the mouse, so the keyboard seems <br/>\nawkward)?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
