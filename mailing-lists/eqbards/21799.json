As a matter of fact, I was going to put <br/>\nthe very words in my post &quot;why have them at all?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I ever use pixie strike right now is to interrupt spell <br/>\ncasters. It&#39;s pretty effective in that regard. It&#39;d be very powerful it it <br/>\nwould stun the mob, but maybe it&#39;d be too powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby would be an extremely powerful song if it worked even close to the <br/>\nenchanter&#39;s AOE spell. At it&#39;s present state it really only is an AOE <br/>\ntaunt. :-P  Verant is looking at the play balance issues and I respect <br/>\nthat. But if they believe that the only way to keep play balance is to make <br/>\nthe resists so high and the duration so iffy, then I agree, why have this <br/>\nsong in the first place? They say that this song is working as they see <br/>\nfit. I can see why they wouldn&#39;t want bards running rampant in a dungeon <br/>\nkeeping everything mez&#39;d. But I can&#39;t see why any bard would ever use this <br/>\nsong then.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps Verant should think of adding their &quot;mana&quot; component to this song <br/>\nand increasing our chances of mezing with Lullaby? That may take care of <br/>\ntheir worries about bards running nilly willy mezing everything in sight?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:34 PM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;No, but since our mez spells are effectively useless a mere 5 levels after<br/>\n&gt;we get them, why give them to us at all?
