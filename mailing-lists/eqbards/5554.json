I am lvl 38 now , a smidge away from <br/>\n&gt; 39 and i quit.  I got bored with guk , i got bored with playing , hunting or <br/>\n&gt; otherwise.  I think for me , i miss open spaces, i miss places like lake <br/>\n&gt; rathe , lesser fay , or steamfont . I&#39;m sick of being confined no matter what <br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m doing , i mean i got to camp the undead tower in the cav room. got great <br/>\n&gt; exp /loot , but for the most part i was bored. I thought and thought and <br/>\n&gt; thought what had changed , why all of a sudden i was so bored. It came to me <br/>\n&gt; , i can&#39;t solo effectively anywhere anymore it seems.  I like to group and <br/>\n&gt; hunt , but sometimes i&#39;d like to try hunting solo  , and i&#39;ve found i can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; AT ALL , i know bards are meant to be group oriented classes , but i wish i <br/>\n&gt; could kill something myself . Aww hell this turned into a rant , sorry. But i <br/>\n&gt; still love this game , i miss my friends ( who have blown by me in the 2 <br/>\n&gt; weeks i haven&#39;t played , guess they can smell 50 and went nuts ) and i want <br/>\n&gt; to play. but where and what ? what did you high level people hunt to have fun <br/>\n&gt; , i mean i get bored after like 15 minutes of being in the same spot now. I <br/>\n&gt; was thinking of mistmoore , but i want a little more info first . Sorry , <br/>\n&gt; someone please help me out , give me somf fun things i can do or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lower Guk is a lot less boring if you don&#39;t camp. Treat it like a real<br/>\ndungeon, and work your way in, stopping off occasionally to clear likely<br/>\nspecial spots a few times and clear ahead of you before moving forward<br/>\nto what you hope will be the next safe spot to med and heal. That&#39;s how<br/>\nthe party I did lower with did it. It&#39;s a lot more dangerous, but way<br/>\nmore fun than what I now see people doing, which is picking one<br/>\nparticular spawn and camping it. There is so much down there it&#39;s<br/>\namazing, but these people seem to only camp the spawns someone in the<br/>\ngroup has been shown by someone else, where the real fun, IMO, is<br/>\nexploring and finding the specials yourself. At L38 you are still a bit<br/>\nweak for real deep but with 2 partys it can be done. Or you could go to<br/>\nNagafen&#39;s and pull to the door like so many do, but that is way more<br/>\nboring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the lack of ability to solo, I guess we&#39;ve all confronted that at<br/>\nsome point. I basically dealt with it by mothballing my L49 bard and<br/>\nstarting a druid on the new server. I had great fun with my bard but at<br/>\nthis point I&#39;m tired of being totally at the mercy of the rest of the<br/>\nparty as to where we go and what we hunt, and tired of all the good gear<br/>\ngoing to the melee fighters first, then people getting tired of camping<br/>\nthe spot before my turn comes around for a shot at it. Bards are really<br/>\nin demand in high level parties for their mana pumping, but it gets old<br/>\neventually. Now most of the people I used to group with are playing<br/>\ntweaked newbie chars and amusing themselves gathering top gear for them,<br/>\nand always ask me to come help, but none are available to help me go try<br/>\nfor a Ykesha so I&#39;d rather just play my druid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
