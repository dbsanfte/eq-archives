It would be SO<br/>\ngreat though!! =) I do like HoR and Niv&#39;s though in groups with no cleric.<br/>\nIn fact, I did sing just these two songs with 7string lute in solb the other<br/>\nnight. It was myself (52 bard), a 53 pal and 53 war. We took on LBs and<br/>\nLDCs, sometimes two at a time, with little downtime, all things being<br/>\nconsidered. With multiple pulls, I charmed when I had mana, and used Pixie<br/>\nstrike in other situations. Sometimes it was just more efficient to mez them<br/>\nsince LDCs were becoming more and more immune to my charm hehe =P  But on<br/>\nsingle pulls, I wove HoR and Niv&#39;s without a doubt. Neither of the party<br/>\nmembers realized how little health they lost against the LDCs, and when the<br/>\nWar lost a lot of hps it was due to the LDC&#39;s BB DoT. At which time, he&#39;d<br/>\nback out for the healing songs without the damage being dealt to him along<br/>\nwith the Blood Boil.<br/>\n<br/>\nPava Rahti &lt;Holy Fire&gt;<br/>\nMember of the 52nd choir<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Never won rolls, never got into the best group, or<br/>\nhad the greatest combination of party members? ... I was shocked to say the<br/>\nleast, as would anyone be upon getting their first major BP. Yay now my top<br/>\nmatches, all in IP. Legs and boots still a mismatched disaster...<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime Sunday night we decided it was time for the majority of us to get<br/>\non out of the alternate plane. A friend gives me a /t. &quot;whatcha doin?  Nag<br/>\nwent down, he dropped CoF, burnt book half (or whatever), Heiro crook, CoF,<br/>\nWt red. box, and drums.
