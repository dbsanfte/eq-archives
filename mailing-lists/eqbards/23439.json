Nice on a newbie too since Hymm and Chords<br/>\n&gt; are both string.  If<br/>\n&gt; you need a break .. have Selo&#39;s up and kite a sec<br/>\n&gt; with heal/selo but usually<br/>\n&gt; you won&#39;t need to.  Have a the lute to drum hotkey<br/>\n&gt; setup - and you should<br/>\n&gt; always make zone if you need to bail out.   Spiders<br/>\n&gt; (have to sit to outheal<br/>\n&gt; the poison so bad) and YKs (hit harder than the<br/>\n&gt; wisps) are a no-no.<br/>\n&gt; Skellies Bad too (stun). Got a few looks to be sure<br/>\n&gt; .. but it worked!
