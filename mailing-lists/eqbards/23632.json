The bard was singing the<br/>\noddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>\nCurtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>\nsinging celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>\nanything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>\nquite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping 2 mobs at bay<br/>\nwith no trouble...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
