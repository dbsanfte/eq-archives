Or<br/>\ncan we go on to a new topic?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re no drop to foil Lightstone hunters.  Many people hunt wisps at night,<br/>\nand once judged which wisps to kill by whether they had a glow or not.  Now,<br/>\nthe wisps that used to have no lightstone at all have burned out lightstones,<br/>\nso they all glow at night.  They are NO DROP so that unscrupulous players<br/>\ncan&#39;t sell them to newbies (since they dissappear when you log, and are<br/>\nworthless to vendors).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mikal Stormsong  23 Song  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
