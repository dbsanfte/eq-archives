They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you<br/>\n&gt; around. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for similar<br/>\n&gt; level ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below<br/>\n&gt; limit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group<br/>\n&gt; with a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th<br/>\n&gt; level ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put<br/>\n&gt; any significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either<br/>\n&gt; ignorant, or greedy.

I do remember the meat of it, which is that the<br/>\ndistance that people can be apart is one quarter the levels of the highest level<br/>\nperson in the party.  So a level 40 person and a level 31 person could group and<br/>\nboth get experience.  There were a number of exceptions involved as well, but I<br/>\ndont&#39; remember them :(  I believe there is a lower limit of 3, which makes<br/>\nsense.  Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that this is the UPPER<br/>\nlimit as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to play only with the same people all the time, and we&#39;re all the same<br/>\nlevel, so I don&#39;t have a lot of experience to go on here.  I know when I was<br/>\nlevel 19, I could group with people who were level 25, but not with people who<br/>\nwere level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
