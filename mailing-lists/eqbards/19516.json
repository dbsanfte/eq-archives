Tell everyone to hold off on mana and charm it.  18<br/>\nseconds later you will never get it off ya.  I even convinced our enchanter<br/>\nhe could play wizard when needed and nuke away cause one pulse of charm kept<br/>\nthe mob on me or the taunter for the rest of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nA related issue with bards and rangers grouped together.  I&#39;ve been grouped<br/>\nwith rangers a lot recently using snare/fear in the Overthere.  It works<br/>\nquite well at taking down mobs with little risk to the group.  The only<br/>\nproblem is that the ranger (high 30s) takes all the damage if the mob<br/>\nresists fear and starts attacking us.  I know the ranger is inflicting more<br/>\nmelee damage than me but the fear song is supposed to have a high taunt<br/>\nfactor.  You would think that after hitting a mob with fear constantly over<br/>\nseveral rounds I would piss them off some.  Not so.  In a bad combat with<br/>\nmultiple fear resists, the ranger will often be at half health while I will<br/>\nstill be at almost full health.  I&#39;ve even tried weaving in Hymn to try and<br/>\nmove myself up the hate list in order to get the mob to attack me and spread<br/>\nout damage some.  That doesn&#39;t work either.  I can see why a lot of rangers<br/>\nhave been complaining about this recently.  I guess its a step in the right<br/>\ndirection that they are getting a spell to move them down the hate list.<br/>\nThey probably need it a lot earlier than they are getting it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they screwed up by<br/>\nnot increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face they give Rangers<br/>\na spell to lower their hate list factor.  So much for Symphonic Harmony<br/>\nbeing unique to bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit the cynical<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it, all it takes is a patch where they don&#39;t tell us things that we<br/>\ninstantly find out anyway, to make me cynical once again. <br/>\nThere was also some talk last night of new hybrid spells available from<br/>\nvendors.  I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>\nbeing literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
