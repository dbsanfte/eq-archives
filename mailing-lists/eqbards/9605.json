The dirk had an incorrect treasure table entry and<br/>\nD&#39;vinn was dropping it every time for about two months.  <br/>\nSince D&#39;vinn spawned about once every 20 minutes, that was<br/>\nabout 50+ new dirks added to the world every day.  With such a<br/>\nhuge supply and fixed demand, the price plummeted to 15-30pp.  <br/>\nEver since it&#39;s been fixed so he drops it about 1 in 10 times,<br/>\nthe price has slowly been going up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Langseax is the product of a rather involved quest that<br/>\ntakes a couple hours to complete.  Also, a key NPC in the<br/>\nquest is often killed since he sometimes carries an item for<br/>\nanother quest.  I&#39;ve often seen Palgin or Basil walking<br/>\naround in WK, and not killed them because the quest is so<br/>\ninvolved and I think they only spawn when someone initiates<br/>\nthat part of the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the price difference on these two is mostly a result of<br/>\nsupply.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
