Go back and re-read his posts - NEVER does he claim to be a<br/>\nprogrammer (that I saw) but the detail and quality of his information made<br/>\nit sure seem like he - himself had to be a Verant employee.  But really --<br/>\nthat&#39;s something that _we_ super-imposed on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t start calling him an imposter or a fake or a fraud.  I re-read<br/>\nall his posts (that I saved and I think it was all the good ones) and while<br/>\nhe drops names and hints about insider stuff all the time - I never found<br/>\nany place we he made any claims  about being on the dev team.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could I possibly know all this???  Well, you yourself can ask Brad<br/>\nMcQuaid next time you meet him at Gencon or somewhere.
