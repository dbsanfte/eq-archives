Not just from Grobb anymore!<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks, every friday over on the CoN discussion board I drop a troll post in just for fun, the first<br/>\none was about how you should be able to store bind locations in your spellbook (UO Recall<br/>\neffectivly) the next was about how clerics who didn&#39;t heal me when asked (and shamens who didn&#39;t<br/>\nSoW) weren&#39;t doing their job :o) the third (under my own name even) was about getting a sex change<br/>\noperation...*laughs* every time I got people to get hooked, my point it I know about trolling (never<br/>\nmind all the years on Usenet, when netcom was as reprehensible an address as AOL became later).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur MrS8N is a troll pure and simple, he is here to stir up an otherwise useful list, to get us all<br/>\ntalking about him. He has little to nothing of value to say, or, if there IS content it is still for<br/>\nthe purpose of causing dischord. For everyones sanity, just ignore him, he is worth it, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
