At THAT point, some zones<br/>\nwere labeled as dungeons and a note was there that you could not bind there.<br/>\nI guess it never pinged on me &quot;duh. That&#39;s what casters are doing on those<br/>\nVox raids, etc&quot; since I have never gotten high enough to really do a lot in<br/>\ndungeons (I&#39;m somewhat afraid of them) For myself, those of my characters<br/>\nthat can bind do NOT do it in a dungeon. They do it near a zoneline that<br/>\ndoes not get a lot of<br/>\ntrains (and usually up a wall somewhere)<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
