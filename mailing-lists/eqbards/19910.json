Well, I certainly doubt this bard armor drop has ANYTHING to do <br/>\nwith the recent patch. Someone was bound to bring up this coincidence sooner <br/>\nor later tho. The bottom line is we still don&#39;t have our damn bracers and <br/>\narms. Just tonight FoH took Trak out a second time. He dropped a shaman and <br/>\nSK breastplate, as well as the teeth yada yada yada. They&#39;ll be hitting <br/>\nVeeshan&#39;s Peak before long, and from the kinds of drops we&#39;re seeing outside <br/>\nof that place, I will die laughing if VP loots turn out to be as much of a <br/>\njoke as PoS. Watch EQ get patched and FoH enters VP only to find our Singing <br/>\nSteele Vambracers. Must&#39;ve been that last patch, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\nperma-54th Bard, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kevin L.
