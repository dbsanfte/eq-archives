It&#39;s pretty damn sweet, and moreso now that it acts as a universal <br/>\ninstrument. He tested it on different songs and found that it is <br/>\nsubstantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d drums or kelin&#39;s <br/>\nlute, but it still amplifies pretty well. I&#39;m sure someone will post some <br/>\nstats on how it stacks up verses our normal instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS. We&#39;ve been killing Vox <br/>\nweekly, but she has not been very generous with scales. If you want to see a <br/>\nCRAP loot load, you should have been present yesterday when ALL she dropped <br/>\nwas 4 frozen paladin books. Today she dropped 2 RBB&#39;s, a bracer, and a <br/>\ncrystal spear so she kinda made up for that faux pax, but STILL NO <br/>\nSCALES...grr...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well. If Shada or anyone else with an SSS posts some instrument-tests I&#39;m <br/>\nsure we&#39;d all be curious to see how it does. =P<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori{Legion}<br/>\n57th Karaoke Singer, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Stephane Lange &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slange@...\">slange@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Bard Epic quest<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 2 Oct 2000 10:40:28 +0200<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It seems that she has been found<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;sss_stats[1].jpg&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Singin Short sword<br/>\n&gt;Mgic lore no drop<br/>\n&gt;1HS  16/26<br/>\n&gt;STR+15 DEX+10 STA+10 CHA+15 HP+50 MANA+10 all resists +10<br/>\n&gt;Effect : Dance of the blade<br/>\n&gt;WT: 2.0<br/>\n&gt;Class: BRD<br/>\n&gt;Race: ALL<br/>\n&gt;Dance of the Blade<br/>\n&gt;Increase Attack Speed by 55% (L1)<br/>\n&gt;Increase Attack (ATK) by 30 (L1)<br/>\n&gt;Increase Strength by 30 (L1)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Classes: None<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Range to Target: 100 feet<br/>\n&gt;Area Effect Range: 30 feet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Instantaneous<br/>\n&gt;Allowable Targets: Full Group<br/>\n&gt;Resistance Check: None<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Spell Duration: 25 ticks (2.5 minutes)<br/>\n&gt;Duration Formula: 3<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
