At 24th<br/>\nthey gave me a noticable boost in experience every time I killed one.  They<br/>\nhave a fairly serious poison so take precautions against that.  Sitting and<br/>\nsinging hymn with a lute you still gain 2 or 4 health points per tick while<br/>\npoisoned, so it won&#39;t kill you if you play smart.<br/>\n<br/>\n[49 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;roleplay&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am level 24 almost 25.
