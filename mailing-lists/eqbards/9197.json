Being<br/>\nthe adventurous fool that I am, I decided to climb the wizard teleport<br/>\nspires in North Karana.  Being the wood elf that I am I climbed to the top<br/>\nof the spire quite easily and proceeded to sit down while I waited for my<br/>\nfriends to arrive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I forgot about the z-axis attack ability of mobs, so I left to<br/>\nget a snack and I return to find myself under attack by a griffawn that<br/>\nsomeone trained on me.  So quickly I stand up proceed to begin running.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoading Please Wait....<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah I fell to my death.  Boy did I feel stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
