Not much talk of new servers, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem like the newer servers are threatening to get as large as older ones,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering when the last of us will be kicked off the last server?  Yeah,<br/>\nI&#39;m sure EQ2, and Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside, and whatever else will<br/>\nbe super, but I&#39;m having a hard time picturing myself saying, at anytime,<br/>\n&quot;Well Atonal ole bud, it&#39;s been fun, but I&#39;m off to play something else<br/>\nnow.&quot;.  I mean, c&#39;mon!  The time invested, the character developed, the fun<br/>\nhad, the friends made, the equipment gained...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not mental, and I can walk away from the game when necessary (my job is<br/>\nsecure and my wife is happy), however, ...  the easiest way to explain this<br/>\nis...I am Atonal.  In much the same way the reality of the body is the<br/>\nvehicle of the mind, that collection of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s in *that* reality has<br/>\nalso been a vehicle of my mind.  I am he, and he is me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the reality is, if EQ disappears tomorrow, life will go on, and the<br/>\nmajority of us will move on...but does that change the fact that our<br/>\ncharacters are us, and to see them die, knowing they can never return would<br/>\nnot be truly painful, both mentally and emotionally?<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to quit EQ once.  I figured that going to school, it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nworth the monthly fee.  About a month later, I realized that EQ was the only<br/>\ngame I wanted to play, even if I could only be on half of every month, or<br/>\nless.  My free time was spent wishing I could play EQ.  So when I caved in,<br/>\nand logged back on the first time after quitting, imagine my joy at seeing<br/>\nAtonal, there in that character screen, merrily spinning in circles swiping<br/>\nat air!<br/>\n<br/>\nWoot!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk...maybe I *am* mental...  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLong live,<br/>\nAtonal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
