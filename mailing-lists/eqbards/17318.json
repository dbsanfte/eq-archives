Your statement does not give enough information.

This includes EQ.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup over a TNT2,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you see in some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reviews.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why? Because my brother<br/>\n&gt; in law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife has the same setup<br/>\n&gt; with a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my GeForce at 1024X768<br/>\n&gt; that they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There is a HUGE<br/>\n&gt; performance increase that is VERY noticable if you have your<br/>\n&gt; computers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24 person raid on Kedge<br/>\n&gt; Keep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off, same setup on<br/>\n&gt; all 3 computers and they were both lagging and had much much lower<br/>\n&gt; frame rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at 1024x768 as I<br/>\n&gt; would have been had I been the only one in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your statement does not give enough information.  If you all have the same<br/>\nsetup as each other (except video cards) and the systems are NOT PIII or<br/>\nAthlon then you will see tremendous improvements from the GeForce Card over<br/>\nthe TNT2 Ultra in all areas.  Otherwise (if you did have a PIII setup or an<br/>\nAthlon to a much lesser extent) in many areas the TNT2 Ultra will do almost<br/>\nas well as the GeForce card.   This is because the PIII SSE and the Athlon<br/>\n3dNOW instruction sets do a lot of the work that the GeForce processor does<br/>\nthus giving a &#39;diminishing returns&#39; effect to the GeForce.  There&#39;s still<br/>\nimprovement by upgrading (as I said before) but it&#39;s not as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee Tom&#39;s Hardware page for a full run-down on the differences and<br/>\nadvantages of GeForce 256 DDR over Riva TNT2 Ultra.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is still a noticeable improvement of the GeForce over a TNT 2 Ultra<br/>\nbut is the difference worth $300?  Not in my world but others may have a lot<br/>\nmore money to throw around.  As I said in an earlier post:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an older system an upgrade to the GeForce may be a good idea.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re on a newer PIII system I would wait till the NV15 or Bitboys new<br/>\nGraphics cards come out.  Both cards are at least 4 times better than the<br/>\nGeForce and should market at about $400.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to the buyer:  $300 (yes I know you can get them for around $230-$260 as<br/>\nwell) now and $400 later this year?  Or stick to what works now and just pay<br/>\n$400 later?  The advantages of the GeForce are great.  It&#39;s<br/>\nan AWESOME card.  But I would recommend doing some pretty extensive reading<br/>\nabout the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the GeForce (or any 2nd gen card)  before I run<br/>\nout and buy it.  3rd Generation cards are just around the corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>\nbased on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133 chipset<br/>\nwith 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz and<br/>\nuse SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>\nsystem on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>\nbetter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
