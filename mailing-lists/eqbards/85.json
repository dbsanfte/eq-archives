I know you have to target\r<br/>\nyourself, but the song keeps ended after one pulse.  Is it supposed to do\r<br/>\nthat?  I haven&#39;t seen any improvement in merchant prices either, is that\r<br/>\nmaybe I don&#39;t have a brass instrument equipped when I sing it?  Are you\r<br/>\nsupposed to click on the merchant when you have the song icon in the active\r<br/>\nspells area?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
