Lotsa SS out there, lots of it belongs to warriors<br/>\nand stuff that think cobalt is an even trade for (haha right!)  So i keep to<br/>\nmyself quiet... Got free ss boots a while back from a friend. Got a free SS<br/>\nhelm other night from some friends who just came out of seb. And 2 nights<br/>\nago i get a few people asking me about bards in guildchat, one was asking me<br/>\nwhat i was using because he wanted to &quot;twink&quot; his level 30 bard (ok at least<br/>\nits not a lev 4). And then a good buddie sends me a tell right afterwards<br/>\nasking me if i had my ss gloves, i told him thats why im hunting in karnors<br/>\nat 41. Soooo next time i see his chanter i get a free set of ss gloves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question: what are people using as a cloak? (other then cloak of<br/>\nflames)<br/>\nI got a kunzar cloak last night (hey i was using bronze) and was wondering<br/>\nif i should ask my buddy to trade me his lizzie cloak, or should i try to<br/>\nbuy a better cloak, if so which?<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 25, 2000 10:13 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Suggestions for a Level 30<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHahah Correction!  The bard only ones tend to be ninja looted by fellow<br/>\nguild members to put in the &quot;bank&quot; (i.e. their level 4 bard twink who they<br/>\ncan&#39;t play worth crap but want to equip).

The spine I am <br/>\n&gt; not familiar<br/>\n&gt; with, the Walking Stick I have and use because I like the <br/>\n&gt; effect message:<br/>\n&gt; &#39;somemob01 glances nervously about&#39; (tashan). The &#39;claw <br/>\n&gt; thing&#39; sounds like<br/>\n&gt; Sainey&#39;s Claw which I also have and use because it adds 10 <br/>\n&gt; AC.  Some next<br/>\n&gt; step bard weaps are: Sionache&#39;s Partisan 9/19 piercing, <br/>\n&gt; Symphonic Saber 11<br/>\n&gt; 23 with the effect that lowers you on the hate list.  Jade <br/>\n&gt; mace 9 18 is good<br/>\n&gt; too but maybe a bit harder to get as they are usable by other classes.<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Dagger is 10 21 - awesome.  breath of Harmony 10 18 <br/>\n&gt; effect: Niv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Preservation - uber.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All of these weps are normally obtain by level 50+ groups in <br/>\n&gt; the Kunark<br/>\n&gt; Dungeons.
