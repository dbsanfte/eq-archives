Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; super-powers.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Unless you lack the imagination to do anything better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My point was, if you were playing Cazic and had this power,<br/>\n&gt;would you ever die?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If not, and a mob with this power can be killed, then what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;the point of giving him this power?  All it&#39;s done is made him<br/>\n&gt;more difficult to kill.  Well, there are lots of ways to make<br/>\n&gt;mobs more difficult to kill without resorting to random<br/>\n&gt;insta-death.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You folks are trying to justify the DT saying that he&#39;s a god<br/>\n&gt;and should have it.  That&#39;s fine and good, but if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;use it like a being of super-intelligence, then I don&#39;t see it<br/>\n&gt;being much different than death by router crash - i.e. it gets<br/>\n&gt;applied more or less randomly and without reason.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;justify either being necessary for the game IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
