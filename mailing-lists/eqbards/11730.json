Its much easier to pass yourself off as a dark elf<br/>\nthan a Troll in a a Troll city.

Ever think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would change<br/>\n&gt; them into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>\n&gt; (possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>\n&gt; afoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>\n&gt; the frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs as<br/>\n&gt; plotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
