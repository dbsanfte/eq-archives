That<br/>\n&gt; was the point at which I decided to leave the homeland of Kelethin and<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone and start exploring.  Lots of stuff out there to fight at that<br/>\n&gt; level range, both in groups or solo.  I recommend doing the bard mail<br/>\n&gt; delivery quests and explore some on the side.  As long as you don&#39;t run<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; a griffon or giant, you can outrun just about anything you might bump<br/>\ninto.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Taluvil, 12th bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; btw, where is a good place to hunt for this level?  I&#39;ll go pretty much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anywhere (in Steamfont now, soloing stuff outside the mino caves, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouping within)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
