I cannot seem to make it to him without<br/>\n&gt; hitting multiple Gazz spawns (and a Ton Warrior).  I seem to remember<br/>\n&gt; being able to get to him failry easily way back in my troll warrior<br/>\n&gt; days.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We also ran into a repeated problem of a Froglok Apprentice, who would<br/>\n&gt; agrro on our warrior (lvl 13, rest of us are 14).  This is nothing<br/>\n&gt; unusal, however this wily frog would hit our puller with a DD spell,<br/>\n&gt; then Run and get help (the circular room before the room with all the<br/>\n&gt; weird scoffolding).  We would never do a point of damage to him before<br/>\n&gt; he ran.  <br/>\n&gt; The only counter we had to this was for me to go pulling with the<br/>\n&gt; warrior so I could stun then root the appretince (and then let my pet<br/>\n&gt; smush it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found this pretty bizarre (intelligent) mob behavior.  Is this<br/>\n&gt; normal?  Any better ideas of how to deal with it (having your only<br/>\n&gt; healer go on a pull is not a real great idea, IMHO)<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
