I unequiped my two bracers that provide AC8 (I think)<br/>\n&gt; and took a look at my AC total and it dropped by 15 points.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; this is just a guess but it is possible that the material value is<br/>\n&gt; factored into the AC total, so a piece of AC5 mesh(like chain) adds 8 to<br/>\n&gt; your overall AC and AC5 plate adds 10 to your overall AC.  Thereby making<br/>\n&gt; it quite viable to go for a full suit of plate armor, since this will tip<br/>\n&gt; the scales in your favour for damage resists.  Can anyone verify this<br/>\n&gt; hypothesis?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 5 Aug 1999, Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was like night and day, and in my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion still is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of<br/>\nsay 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material<br/>\nmakes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
