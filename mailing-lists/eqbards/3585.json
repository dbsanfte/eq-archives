It is not 45 minutes between Paw and Qeynos, unless you<br/>\ntake like 5 minutes to zone.  It&#39;s about 15 with Accelerando<br/>\nand a drum, about 20-25 without any speedup (haven&#39;t timed<br/>\nthat).<br/>\n<br/>\n45 minutes I can probably make it from Freeport to Qeynos<br/>\nwithout any speedup.  With Accelerando, it&#39;s closer to a half<br/>\nhour.  Going through all of Oasis is 75 seconds with<br/>\nAccelerando.  BB docks to Kaladim is 65 seconds.  The world is<br/>\nnot as big as most people think, it just feels big because<br/>\nthey find travel boring.  This is why I still despise the<br/>\nboats (though they thankfully added a second boat to the FP-BB<br/>\nrun).  In the time it takes me to wait for and ride the boat,<br/>\nI could&#39;ve run through 4-6 zones.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
