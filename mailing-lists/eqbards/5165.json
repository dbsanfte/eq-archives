It&#39;s the anticipation,<br/>\ndiscovery, and the interaction you have with others in getting<br/>\nthere.  Telling others (bragging if you like) that and how you<br/>\ngot an item or level is as much or more fun than actually<br/>\ngetting it.  (And for many of us, it is equally fun to see<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s reaction when you turn right around and give that<br/>\nitem to them for simply being a friend or nice person.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
