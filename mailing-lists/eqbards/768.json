Highpass is easy IF<br/>\nyou have invisibility, without it, you&#39;re a bullseye waiting to be hit.  In<br/>\nRunnyeye, you can darn near outrun anything.  Another suggestion when<br/>\nheading form running from Runnyeye to Qeynos would be to wait on the<br/>\nRunnyeye side for the usual party of adventurers to lure something big from<br/>\nthe left-hand gorge.  This will usually drag a small train of the biggest<br/>\npains (minos and/or muddites) leaving you a fairly clear path for at least<br/>\nhalf the run.  After that, it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t get hit&quot; and you&#39;re fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I believe that SoW and Accelerando were initially intended to<br/>\nbe equal, however, Bardic spells increase in power over time, whereas most<br/>\nspells do not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies on Bristlebane<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
