Both of<br/>\nthese weapons have plusses and minusses and I was wondering if anyone here had<br/>\nan opinion of which, if either, is better and why. Or if you know of any other<br/>\nweapons that can be bought (I hate camping) for around 100-200pp feel free to<br/>\nexpound on their virtues as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. A piercing weapon would work too. I already use a Dragoon Dirk as my<br/>\nsecondary weapon.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
