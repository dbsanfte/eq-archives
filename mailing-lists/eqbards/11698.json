If you&#39;re 28th through 38th-ish I implore you to try<br/>\nCazic-Thule.  I&#39;ve said it before: There&#39;s a learning curve to the place,<br/>\nbut if you can get into a competent and reasonably balanced group in the<br/>\nthrone room, Archon temple top or alligators at the green and blue pools you<br/>\nwill be amazed at the experience and loot.  If you&#39;re unfamiliar with CT and<br/>\nneed a hand figuring the place out *please* just ask.  I cannot stress how<br/>\nwell I did in this place from 28th-37th.  I made TONS of experience: A full<br/>\nlevel one Saturday at 31st and, and all of 30th in three evenings.  All the<br/>\nwhile I was staggering under the weight of fine steel weapons and 1-4pp<br/>\ndrops.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo nights ago I was hunting Spectres in Feerrott and was in a fair amount<br/>\nof danger for pretty minimal exp.  My group was complaining about this so I<br/>\nsaid &quot;Hey, Cazic-Thule is right here, let&#39;s go in there.&quot;  To which two of<br/>\nmy members replied along the lines of &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know Cazic well, only<br/>\nbeen in there once or twice.&quot; so under my urging we went there and took the<br/>\nupper throne room.  My group was utterly amazed.  I got one and a half<br/>\nbubbles exp. in the two or three hours that we were there before I logged,<br/>\nand I&#39;m 37th!  My group *did* benefit from my 9 levels of experience and<br/>\nLament though (I was pulling).<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\nObnoxious about Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip about hunting cyclops in Rathe Mts.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Once I make 30th level, I plan on making this spot my home until I get out<br/>\n&gt; of hell level.
