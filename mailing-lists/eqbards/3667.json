Or any of the other slow the mob<br/>\n&gt;down songs like Melodic Binding.  The difference from Druid, Cleric and<br/>\n&gt;Shaman spells is the fact that most people fail to see that you are<br/>\n&gt;actually helping them.  Do they notice the mob is bound by strands of<br/>\n&gt;music?  Not really, but it is still gratifying to do the deed.  Who know<br/>\n&gt;if they noticed, who knows if they will ever help you?  Instant<br/>\n&gt;gratification isn&#39;t there , but you never know where kindness can come<br/>\n&gt;from =).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Treilanin Loreweaver 21st Chorus Bard of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;Aariel 5th Circle Mage of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;Honour Guard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unobtrusive is exactly what I want, just at 16 lullaby is the<br/>\nbest we&#39;ve got.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen, Journeyman Bard<br/>\nSwifthawk, Apprentice Shaman of the great white north</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
