The problem now is actually finding two like-level mobs<br/>\n&gt;to play charm tricks with, and managing to keep them far<br/>\n&gt;enough from other people so that they don&#39;t decide to attack<br/>\n&gt;because they can&#39;t find anything else to fight.  (For some<br/>\n&gt;reason most people don&#39;t seem to understand that if two mobs<br/>\n&gt;are fighting each other, then someone is causing it.  They<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t see a player fighting them so they think the mobs are<br/>\n&gt;free.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem yet on the younger shards (I<br/>\n&gt;saw lots of giants last night on Tunare), but it&#39;s painfully<br/>\n&gt;evident on the older ones.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen two giants<br/>\n&gt;at once (except ice giants) in the entire last month on<br/>\n&gt;Karana.  And when we did try fighting ice giants, the kill<br/>\n&gt;stealers descended like flies to sh!t within a half hour.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
