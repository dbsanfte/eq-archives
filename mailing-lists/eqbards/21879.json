I say this because in my<br/>\ncleric&#39;s group (which is now lvl 30) our bard still uses lullaby effectivly.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure when it becomes useless (Elfson just about never used it<br/>\nbecause high taunt factor in pickup groups was too risky for him), but it<br/>\nhas some use at least.  Pixie Strike on the other hand is pretty weak for<br/>\nmezzing.  Though I still love the song for its stun effect.  My guild (who I<br/>\nnow spend most of my time grouped with) was shocked when a healer mob bot<br/>\noff a heal in combat.  &quot;Elf, what did you fall asleep there?&quot;  (I actually<br/>\ndidn&#39;t knwo the mob was a healer thus wasn&#39;t stunning).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that shows how useful that song is, my guild just assumes that every<br/>\nheal is going to get interupted.  (Obviously not just me doing it).  SO that<br/>\nsong is still useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nFace the facts, we knew a month ago we would never get to mez at higher<br/>\nlevels.  Live with it.   I don&#39;t know why you masochistly read Gordon&#39;s<br/>\nposts anymore.  You know what he&#39;s going to say.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
