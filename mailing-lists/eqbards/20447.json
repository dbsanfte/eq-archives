I didn&#39;t need to Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>\n&gt; druids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I could have sang <br/>\n&gt; battle buffs to buff some str and dex and such, but there was only 1 <br/>\n&gt; tank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of mileage gained.  So, <br/>\n&gt; I chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a little) and I played <br/>\n&gt; mana song and bind sight to help scout in the downtime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was I being the most effective Bard I could be... imho, Yes.  And was <br/>\n&gt; that helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t forget the magic, fire, <br/>\n&gt; and cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top of the damage you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; doing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers, procing weapons, <br/>\n&gt; overzealous druids with their newfound starburst, etc. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
