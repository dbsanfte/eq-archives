Not to sound rude, but I&#39;m getting tired of people saying<br/>\nthat there IS a bug without doing tests about it.  Everyone here who has sat<br/>\ndown and started a variety of songs and counted missed notes seems to have<br/>\nnormal failure rates, yet you&#39;re accusing everyone of &quot;black helicopter crap&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tested last night with my level 30 song, which I had never even played before<br/>\n(I just levelled), and I missed 6 notes in 60 tries.  That&#39;s a reasonable fizzle<br/>\nrate, in my opinion.  With Bellow, I missed one note in 60.  With Hymn, I missed<br/>\n3 in 60.  After that, I grew weary of counting. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your test was Denon&#39;s Discord, I think I know what the problem might be...<br/>\nperhaps there IS a bug in that it&#39;s checking the instrument skill regardless of<br/>\nwhether you&#39;re singing or playing an instrument.   If you&#39;re like me, your brass<br/>\nskill is one of the only ones not maxed out, and denon&#39;s discord uses brass.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Look, I for one am getting tired of the nay-sayers on this missed note<br/>\n&gt; thing. Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I missed notes 10 times<br/>\n&gt; in a row and finally erased it from my list and added a different song. ALL<br/>\n&gt; my skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is 110, there is a<br/>\n&gt; problem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has changed with the<br/>\n&gt; way I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont have a clue<br/>\n&gt; what your talking about. This is a very serious problem in how the Bard is<br/>\n&gt; played, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to effectively. I cannot<br/>\n&gt; depend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to. In fact I find<br/>\n&gt; myself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that hotkey waiting to<br/>\n&gt; push it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play enough to notice a<br/>\n&gt; huge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice it, but dont tell<br/>\n&gt; us we are imagining things. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
