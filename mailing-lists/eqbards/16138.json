Now we take him on on his own isle.  One of<br/>\nthe Paladin&#39;s in our guild has found a way to trick the two Bladestorms into<br/>\nleaving the island so we are able to fight Dojorn solo.  I will try to<br/>\nobserve his techinique next time he go up there.  The full loot list from<br/>\nDojorn last night was a Warrior haste belt, Golden Efreeti Bow (ranger quest<br/>\nitem), and Golden Efreeti Greeves.   On our first Dojorn kill we got 4 items<br/>\nbut 3 rotted due to confusion in the post-kill rezing order.  This time we<br/>\ndid pre-lotto rolls per class for whatever dropped, saved alot of trouble in<br/>\nthat precious 8 mins post-kill time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Dojorn is pretty much immune to magic.  So it is melee, melee, melee.<br/>\nOur group got waxed as BOTH our healers went LD as soon as the battle<br/>\nstarted :(  We had about 45 people there I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
