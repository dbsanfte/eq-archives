Changing the binding policy will change the fighting<br/>\ndynamic.<br/>\nMelee/hybrids will get to spend more time adventuring instead of wasting<br/>\ntime<br/>\nrunning across multiple zones to get their corpse.  As a casual gamer who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get to play that often, this is why I support a change to the<br/>\npolicy.<br/>\nAlso, groups will be less likely to break up if their tanks die because they<br/>\nnow<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to wait a long time for them to return.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the bind policy, it<br/>\nwould be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>\nMelee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and reenter the battle.<br/>\nWhat<br/>\nif the rules were changed to reflect something like along these lines:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Any class can get bound anywhere.  Melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>\nPlayers<br/>\nwithout the bind spell<br/>\n2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed them is still alive<br/>\nwhen<br/>\nthey reappear at their bind point,  that character can no longer do damage<br/>\nto<br/>\nthe mob.  This would not apply if the character was resurrected. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably several different ways this could be worked but I think<br/>\nsomething along these lines would be required as a tradeoff for the change<br/>\nto<br/>\nthe binding policy <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Very good point.  From what I have gathered, it seems the biggest<br/>\n </span></blockquote>complaint<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about giving a melee class the ability to bind, or be bound by a caster,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that it would change the fighting dynamic.  And it obviously would.  That<br/>\n&gt; being said, the one major point that has not been proposed by other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>players<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is a sense of difficulty or loss with getting a melee player bound.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Add in song difficulty and reagents, coupled with real EXP loss to the<br/>\n&gt; person getting bound (2 full bubbles of lost exp would really make a melee<br/>\n&gt; person question getting bound or not, of course the song singer should<br/>\n </span></blockquote>take<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; considerable less exp loss :=) ). and the argument becomes less clear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
