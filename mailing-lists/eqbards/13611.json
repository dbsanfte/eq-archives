Making a spell 10% more<br/>\neffective and giving a second save makes no sense.  That&#39;s perhaps the new<br/>\nstrategy.  Call it an enhancement because you added an MR debuff, when in<br/>\nfact its a nerf because the resist chance nearly doubles.  I bet its even<br/>\nworse than that with Pixie.  since its a mez song do &#39;higher level&#39; critters<br/>\nget a second resist chance vs. both effects?  Yikes that would explain its<br/>\ndecreased effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie Strike WAS changed.  It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>\nWhen it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>\ndebuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
