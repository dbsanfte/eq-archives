Yes we have songs <br/>\nthat lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which is <br/>\nwhy my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want to go <br/>\ninto the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they are <br/>\nso easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do not <br/>\nget a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they are <br/>\ndifficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to group <br/>\nin the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the <br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
