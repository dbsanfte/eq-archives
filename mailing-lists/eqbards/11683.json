DE illusion remains in effect<br/>\nall the time as long as you are wearing mask.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2) When wearing the mask, you get the stat bonuses all the time but DE<br/>\nillusion is not active.  Click on mask icon to activate the illusion.<br/>\nIllusion remains in effect for a certain duration.  Duration wears off when<br/>\nzoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on everything I&#39;ve read, I think #2 is how it works but would just<br/>\nlike confirmation. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tKyle Sibbald [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, December 09, 1999 5:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kyle Sibbald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tResponse to many messages with this one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.\tNew drop is Mask of Deception. Exact same stats as the Guise (4ac<br/>\n&gt; 13cha<br/>\n&gt; 7mr NO DROP yadda yadda) Only new thing is that it must be equipped to<br/>\n&gt; trigger the Illusion: Dark Elf effect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.\tSomeone mentioned about big ogres and trolls blocking hallways and<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; the Guise is perfect for taking care of this. From a utility standpoint,<br/>\n&gt; yes<br/>\n&gt; that is true, but that is about all there is to it. There is really no<br/>\n&gt; sense<br/>\n&gt; of why the Guise is used.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.\tThe RP sense of it all. I know I&#39;d raise my hand first when I say<br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really consider what race a char is when I group with them. I did<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; I was level 6 but now it gets difficult to pick and choose who to group<br/>\n&gt; with. If this were not the case and many people RP&#39;d racial reactions in<br/>\n&gt; groups I&#39;d imagine that there would be a lot fewer dyed DE&#39;s and the ones<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d mostly see would be naturals. (Although the female DE form is rather<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; pleasant sight };)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4.\tEver think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would<br/>\n&gt; change<br/>\n&gt; them into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>\n&gt; (possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>\n&gt; afoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>\n&gt; the frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; plotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5.\tPersonally I&#39;d prefer the thing to have the effect for as long as<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; have it on (not just from an annoying &#39;damn-the<br/>\n&gt; effect-wore-off-gotta-right-click-it-again&#39;). If you want to be a DE then<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d slip the Mask on and the magic of it would change your form. Mostly<br/>\n&gt; similar to what happens in the movie &#39;The Mask&#39;. Unfortunately the engine<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to handle the illusion effect across zones(?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tGood Journey<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 08, 1999 6:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just saw that this had been changed in the patch.
