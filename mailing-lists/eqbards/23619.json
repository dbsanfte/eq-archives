I run it side by side with a Win2k Adv<br/>\n&gt; Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and have had very few problems with each.  The server has been running<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; months now without a reboot, the WinME Machine has been outstanding for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gaming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think what it really comes down to is this.  What are you using the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machine for?  If its work, then security and lower TCO is most likely an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue and I would recommend the W2K series of OS&#39;s.  If the machine is<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personal or home use (games / ease of use / intuitiveness) , use WinME.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are two big areas that we have seen people need support on:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Someone has taken their machine that has gone through EVERY OS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upgrade and has never reformatted it or just cleaned up the drive.<br/>\n(Some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issues there)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  Someone is taking a WinME machine and trying to make into a high<br/>\n&gt; &gt; end work production machine...it was never designed to be that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my .02 :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have a great day Everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kendawen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 25, 2001 2:15 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a<br/>\nless-than-desirable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.
