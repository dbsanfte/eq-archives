Sunday I tried<br/>\nPerma, but I was seen by a mob whilst invis, ran and took a wrong turn and<br/>\nended up dieing, when I got back in the zone somone was shouting Icy<br/>\ngreaves, anyone want them, I shouted &quot;ME&quot; and he replied come to the king<br/>\nroom. Well I knew the king room was hard but I&#39;d never been in Perma so<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to get there, and that loot went to waste because no one<br/>\nwould show me the way there.<br/>\nI went to Solusek A last night and everyone told me I&#39;d find it hard to get<br/>\nto the Solusek Champ or Mage without a group of 6 level 30+&#39;s so I gave up<br/>\nthat idea.<br/>\nI yet to go to Cazic or Guk but I will go when I hit level 28 (Staff of<br/>\nWrithing Proc).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone on Veeshan want to help me in my cause??<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan, who feels like he will never get his Lambent Armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I&#39;ve got a Lambent Fire Opal, just need Icy Greaves and Shin Greaves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Jared J.
