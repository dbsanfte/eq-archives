No one is attacking them either,<br/>\nno AE spells, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrustrating, to say the least.

He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>\n&gt; back. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>\n&gt; attacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>\n&gt; target, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>\n&gt; with Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>\n&gt; back to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>\n&gt; without being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>\n&gt; 2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>\n&gt; It was quite a sight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>\n&gt; new player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>\n&gt; primary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>\n&gt; questions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
