NOTHING annoys<br/>\n&gt; my more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>\n&gt; zones and killing the guards there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>\n&gt; guards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>\n&gt; level 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>\n&gt; players running to them is around level 1 to 3.<br/>\n&gt; I spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>\n&gt; (with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>\n&gt; enough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>\n&gt; high level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>\n&gt; lark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>\n&gt; Shada...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>\n&gt; must make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>\n&gt;  All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>\n&gt; BEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Windolas Stormsong (MM)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt; rewarded for it?
