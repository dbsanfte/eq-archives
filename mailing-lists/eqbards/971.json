There is endless discussion about<br/>\n&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>\nat once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>\nspecial trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>\none song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>\nquickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>\nstopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDo people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>\neffect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>\npressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>\nentirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>\nicon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>\nactually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>\nwhen I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>\neither song!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>\nvery talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>\ntake seriously. <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
