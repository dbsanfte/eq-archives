Plain and simple.  You<br/>\njust need to trust your raid leaders to be fair :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are a tough class to decide on loot rights.  For weapons any other<br/>\nmelee class can use them better than us (since they all have dual attack),<br/>\nthus isn&#39;t the guild served best by having them go to the real melees.  No<br/>\nto mention, a portion of a bard&#39;s life he isn&#39;t even using weapons.  This<br/>\ndefinitly includes most large mobs, which really make a or break a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  We killed Wuoshi.  He(she?) dropped the Crscent Blade (a SWEET<br/>\n1HS) and An Emerald Scimitar (very good ratio, but slow as hell, +100 mana).<br/>\nThe raid leader (clearly) awarded the crscent blade to one of our warriors<br/>\nwho does have his epics yet and gave the scimitar to a druid who isn&#39;t in<br/>\nour guild but id on at least half our raids (we have about 10 players who<br/>\nare members of small guilds, but might as well be in our guild for raid<br/>\npurposes).  However, the warrior was asked to give his lammy (replaced by<br/>\nthe crescent blade) to me, since I did not get the scimitar. (then we<br/>\ndiscovered bards can&#39;t wield lammy&#39;s, heh)<br/>\n<br/>\nA similar case can be made for armor.  Would the guild not be better served<br/>\nby having a tank with a higher ac?  THough bards do take a beating too...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever bards can&#39;t be totally shafted by loot either.  1.  No raid leader<br/>\nwants to shaft anyone.  2.  (at least on my server) Good bards are rare, and<br/>\nmost guilds don&#39;t have enough (I go on raids with at least 3 other guilds,<br/>\nand we have a group of 4 bards who regularly join us from those same guilds.<br/>\nThe 6 (2 from my guild) of us have discussed forming a union, hehehehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like point systems and if I was in charge of a guild, we would use one.<br/>\nHowever, there is something nice about just doing &quot;whats best for the guild&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 55 (WOOHOO!!!) &lt;The Circle of Eternity&gt; Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
