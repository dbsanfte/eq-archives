If you did,<br/>\n&gt; you might have to practice your wind skill up using your lv 16 song.<br/>\nSince<br/>\n&gt; the charisma song is not continuous.. it is impossible to raise your wind<br/>\n&gt; skill with it.  Trust me, you will want your wind skill to be capped when<br/>\n&gt; you hit 19.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a question on this song.  I am a level 17 bard, and just recently<br/>\n&gt; &gt;acquired this song.  I equipped my flute, and tried to play it.  I got<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;following message:  Learn to sing it before you play it.  I proceeded to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;try and sing it, and could never get it going.  Nothing but one missed<br/>\nnote<br/>\n&gt; &gt;after the other.  Is this common?  Am I doing something wrong?  Also, do<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;need a mouthpiece for my flute?  I bought the flute from the Bard&#39;s<br/>\nGuild,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and eqipped it as usual before I tried the song.  Any help at all would<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;greatly appreciated.
