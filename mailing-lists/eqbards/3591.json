Some blues are easy (beetles, lions, orcs) while others are almost <br/>\nsure death (aviaks, most spellcasters, undead reavers)  The classic example of <br/>\nthis is bandits.  A blue fighter type bandit was easy pickings but a blue spell <br/>\ncaster bandit was death.  I usually learn this the hard way...  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBujold  17 triangle<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Group or Solo<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-chlebek (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    7/14/99 7:27 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think this is a matter of playing style, as well as character race and<br/>\n&gt; strength.  I have been unable to solo without dying every five minutes since <br/>\n&gt; level 12 or so.  Mainly because I am a wood elf and most of the things that <br/>\n&gt; are blue to my character have a nasty habit of hitting hard and stunning<br/>\n&gt; often, as well as gathering friends to help them. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Liani<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Playing style, yes. Character race, no. I too am a wood elf and I am still <br/>\nsoloing effectively at level 16. At this time I can take on 2 risky&#39;s or 1 <br/>\ndangerous enemy and come out with at least 2 bubbles of healt left. And when I <br/>\nhit 17 and get dual wield I feel that will give me the extra boost to be able to<br/>\nsolo into the low 20&#39;s or so.<br/>\n     <br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I group with friends whenever they are around, but our <br/>\nschedules don&#39;t always mesh so I&#39;ve learned how to solo too.<br/>\n     <br/>\nTaelin<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
