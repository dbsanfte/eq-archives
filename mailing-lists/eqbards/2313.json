Easily <br/>\n&gt; lulled creatures <br/>\n&gt; &gt; now resist as though I were 8th and trying the song for the first <br/>\n&gt; &gt; time--without a lute.  I have completely given up on it as <br/>\n&gt; it is a huge drag <br/>\n&gt; &gt; having to swim a few miles away from a couple angry birds.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d petition but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; GMs are generally the enemy anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thought people would have noticed this a while ago. The <br/>\n&gt; effectiveness<br/>\n&gt; of the Lament was drastically reduced a couple of patches <br/>\n&gt; ago. I stopped<br/>\n&gt; using it then, as it became less than useful on the mobs I <br/>\n&gt; was fighting<br/>\n&gt; at the time. Maybe it&#39;s been reduced in effectiveness even more in the<br/>\n&gt; most recent patch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few more silent changes I&#39;ve found that you may find dismaying. The<br/>\n&gt; serrated bone dirk, formerly usable by bards, is now not. <br/>\n&gt; Same with the<br/>\n&gt; Black Enamored Chest (actually I think that&#39;s supposed to be black<br/>\n&gt; enamaled and eq&#39;lizer has it spelled wrong but I&#39;d have to <br/>\n&gt; wait until I<br/>\n&gt; get in game and check with our cleric to be sure), which is <br/>\n&gt; now wearable<br/>\n&gt; by every plate wearing class but the bard. I&#39;ve also heard but haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; yet confirmed, that the Mithril chest plate is also not wearable by<br/>\n&gt; bards. It looks like we have effectively been turned into <br/>\n&gt; honorary chain<br/>\n&gt; wearers in terms of magic armor, in that Rubicite so far is the only<br/>\n&gt; armor other than steel and bronze that we can actually wear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
