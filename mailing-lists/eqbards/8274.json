If I dual wield when grouped with them I get the snot<br/>\npounded out of me.  The 23 points of AC (raising me to 393) versus the three<br/>\nmobs usually beating on me far outweighs the measily second hand damage I do<br/>\nto the one mob I&#39;m swinging at.  About the only time I get to use dual wield<br/>\nis soloing, or when grouped with their lower level characters who are<br/>\n12-14th now.  Also I&#39;ve been soloing mostly spiders lately for silk so have<br/>\nkept the chitin shell shield up for the extra poison resist.  A 33% increase<br/>\nin my poison resistance is a big deal when fighting poisoners.  I imagine it<br/>\nwill max out before I exceed 18th level, but that&#39;s still a ways off for me<br/>\nas of yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 3:19 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Elf Hide Gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi,<br/>\n<br/>\nNot certain what you are doing different but I maxed out my dual wield skill<br/>\nbefore I ever reached 18th level.  I had a dragoon dirk  equipped in the off<br/>\nhand so that helped.  I also put ten training points into it so, assuming<br/>\none initial training point gave me a skill level of 17, my dual wield skill<br/>\nwas 27 when I actually started using it.  Since 18th level, my dual wield<br/>\nskill, as well as all combat skills,  still maxes out for my level within an<br/>\nhour or so of levelling.     <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that&#39;s ridiculous.  I have dual wield at 17th, close to the level it<br/>\n&gt; starts<br/>\n&gt; at I think I&#39;m at 23? in it and it goes off for me 10% of the time.  Not<br/>\n&gt; that it hits for all of that 10% of the time.  Even a first level monk<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; dual wield at 10 sees it go off more than 1% of then time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 2:42 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Elf Hide Gloves<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 7 Oct 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and dual wield?
