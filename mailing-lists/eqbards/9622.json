It seems to me the song graphics show up a<br/>\nfraction of a second before the text message (last night I was<br/>\nhaving an atypical 280 ms ping time).  I suspect what&#39;s going<br/>\non is that the graphics are drawn based on a client-side<br/>\ntimer, while the text messages are sent by the server.  So the<br/>\nslight difference is just the time it takes for the server<br/>\nmessage to get to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned before that I usually use the song graphics<br/>\npulsing to tell me to switch to my next song.  Some time ago,<br/>\nI also said I thought our songs weren&#39;t lasting quite as long<br/>\nas before, yet when I timed it I found no difference.  Well<br/>\nnow that I think about it, I started getting this impression<br/>\nabout the time I turned particle density off and began using<br/>\nthe text messages to tell me when to switch songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe this is why I was able to weave 4 songs?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of weaving 4 songs, I&#39;m starting to wonder if JM<br/>\nCapozzi was correct when he said our DoTs last for 10 seconds,<br/>\npulsing 4 times at 2.5 second intervals.  I disagreed with him<br/>\nbecause if you start/stop Accelerando, the boot icon (and<br/>\neffect) lasts from 12-18 seconds.  However, the latest test I<br/>\nran with weaving Clarity (the effect began to taper off when I<br/>\nweaved it with 2 other songs) points to its duration being<br/>\nsomewhere between 7-11 seconds.  I suspect what&#39;s going on is<br/>\nthat some effects (Accelerando, see invis, etc.) are entirely<br/>\nclient-side.  These will last 12-18 seconds (depending on when<br/>\nyou started the song in the 6-second &quot;heartbeat&quot; cycle).  <br/>\nOthers (Clarity, DoTs?, Hymn?) are server-side and quite<br/>\npossibly could last only 10 seconds (which you can&#39;t really<br/>\nsee since the client only updates every 6 seconds).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
