I&#39;ve been close enough<br/>\njust to read their names, and I had at least 1 shaman and one guard (a<br/>\nShadowknight) come running. They don&#39;t have quite the aggro range of a<br/>\ndragon, but a decent one nonetheless. I&#39;m not one who&#39;s camped them really,<br/>\nonly a driveby on occasion if they&#39;re uncamped when I breeze through. Goonda<br/>\ndrops a few nice pieces I can give to the guild. He&#39;s a pain to kite, as he<br/>\nis a shaman, has SoW, heals, slows, nukes, etc... I get rid of his pet first<br/>\nby charming Goonda, and have him beat his mutt down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is &lt;30 for the guards, 35 tops for Goonda?<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
