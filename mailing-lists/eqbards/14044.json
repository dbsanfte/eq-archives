And in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from <br/>\n&gt; dragon breaths.  My <br/>\n&gt; &gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.

Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>\n&gt;   You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.
