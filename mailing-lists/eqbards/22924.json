For me, my bard was my second character ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started because the variety of things a bard could supposedly do with<br/>\ntheir songs.  I liked the fact we got Selos at level 5(my first character<br/>\nwas a shaman and sow was very nice to have).  I liked it that we could wear<br/>\narmor and melee(naive wasn&#39;t I?).  And the challenge that twisting<br/>\nrepresented(and the sore fingers - hehe), always doing something, intrigued<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we all love our bards.  And that makes it so frustrating when it<br/>\nseems others don&#39;t care.

When<br/>\nI first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>\ntheir corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>\nrun faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>\nonce you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, crying over his loss of speed<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
