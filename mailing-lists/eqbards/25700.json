You rarely<br/>\nget hit, can twist in heal if you need, can really do good damage if you<br/>\nmooch a SOW and - best of all - you control where the fight happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear kiting works best if you have a melee friend and no healer. Killing<br/>\nthem fast is critical. Fear works great on some mobs, but is resisted on<br/>\nmany too. You have to expect to get hit occassionally so have Selo ready<br/>\njust in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite Fear/Kiting spots are ones where the mobs stayed in small area<br/>\nfor the most part. You need to be in your 40&#39;s for these two areas<br/>\nhowever. First, is the little field in DW right before you zone into BW.<br/>\nPull something back there, then slow and fear it before it hits you.<br/>\nSecond, is the Log(tm) in BW. This is a guild favorite spot. It&#39;s a little<br/>\nclearing just NE of the giant fort. No wanderers and mobs stay in the<br/>\nclearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nVelious might be a good spot for you at 31st but try to find spot to pull<br/>\nto where there&#39;s no wanderers and mobs that don&#39;t resist much.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch &quot;semi-retired Troubador&quot; of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Katye and Brandon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landmax13@...\">landmax13@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, got the brass thing under control...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nnow for kiting&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nHow/where do ya&#39;ll do kiting?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nDo you prefer charm kiting or fear kiting?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nDo you switch weapons as well?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nDo you beg a sow or are you best off without?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nDo you do more than one mob?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nAnyone?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nAny good sites that talk about it?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n????&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nAny info ya&#39;ll are willing to share I&#39;m up for.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n31st lvl songster&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\ne. marr server&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nJohn Grady<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a><br/>\n(408) 378-9108<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
