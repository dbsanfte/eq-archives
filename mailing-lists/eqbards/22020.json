I haven&#39;t tried to charm an uncharmable mob<br/>\nin a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies, sorry to see you going, but glad you&#39;re going to stay here with us.<br/>\nI have been very burned out on EQ lately.  I haven&#39;t logged Elfson since<br/>\nkilling Vox on Thursday, and I know I won&#39;t touch him till at least next<br/>\nTuesday.  (This week is packed in RL).<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my regular Thursday group (where I am the cleric) that I may be<br/>\ncancelling my account also.  Similar thinking to what Talies wrote about,<br/>\nI&#39;m just tired of being treated poorly.  Add to that BG2 (which I have<br/>\nbarely touched), Playstation2&#39;s imminent release, it being both hockey and<br/>\nfootball season, and my theatrical hobby becoming more time consuming, it&#39;s<br/>\nstarting to seem not worth my $10 a month...<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least for a time (if I cancel) I will stay here too (stifle those<br/>\ngroans!), when Anrachy Online or whatever comes out next I will want to see<br/>\nwho is heading there.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
