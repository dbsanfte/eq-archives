We have this<br/>\n&gt;problem of letting DoT&#39;s do their full damage and many of our fights last 2<br/>\n&gt;mins.  Heck we had a stupid darkness snare wear off on a goblin last nite<br/>\n&gt;and it was ugly.  The necro even admitted he was lazy by just hitting the<br/>\n&gt;mob once with the slowdown and then not giving it a second thought that<br/>\n&gt;after 2 minutes it probably wasn&#39;t slowed again.  I am lucky though in that<br/>\n&gt;both the druids and ranger that I group with are snare happy if anything.<br/>\n&gt;No one would accuse them of being snare lazy that&#39;s for sure!  My guess is<br/>\n&gt;you aren&#39;t snare lazy either Faerain!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You would bet wrong. I&#39;ve had snares wear off on me. Although, part<br/>\nof the problem is, by the end of the battle, I am medding<br/>\nfuriously for mana for heals. I have extra mana for snares at the BEGINNING<br/>\nof the fight (unless someone pulls before I&#39;ve medded enough mana for<br/>\nheals, either. My regular partner doesn&#39;t do that, Anna Faefriend, but<br/>\npickup groups have been bad at not waiting for their healer!) If snare<br/>\nis resisted three times in a row, they have me not even Snare, and just run<br/>\nit down<br/>\n(We&#39;re fighting in Mistmoore) Because they&#39;d rather have my mana for heals.<br/>\n(Though I need to train them to tell me when a second critter enters the<br/>\nbattle so I can astand up and snare that as well)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention learning to throw snares on things in the first place...<br/>\nDespite having it always memmed, I have not had to use it much until<br/>\nlately.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 15 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Freeport)<br/>\n/<br/>\nMeara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&lt;lvl 4 paladin&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
