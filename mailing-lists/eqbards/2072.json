My question is , how<br/>\nlong <br/>\ndid it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is <br/>\nmainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and <br/>\nkeep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a <br/>\nday and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go <br/>\nto the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1) if<br/>\n<br/>\ni throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that <br/>\npoint onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type , or<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be ) <br/>\ndoes it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>\nOk , many thanks .<br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firesong<br/>\nlvl 20 bard of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nMore than 5,000!
