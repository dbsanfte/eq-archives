Hunter & Forager Frooglaks are good test mobs (and great exp<br/>\ntoo).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do a lot of root - dotting (since I usually have my cleric with my bard.)<br/>\nPull mob, root it, back off and dot it.  Alternatively, you can pull mob,<br/>\nmelee it, get chealed.  Or pull mob, snare it, fear it and chase it.  Try<br/>\nall of these methods and see which one kills the mob faster.  What I found,<br/>\ngiven mobs that have zero or low resists, root dotting is by far the &#39;best&#39;<br/>\nin that the mobs die faster and there is virtually no down time between<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group, they like to &quot;see&quot; damage, especially if they have other&#39;s hits<br/>\nturned on.  If they don&#39;t see numbers on the screen, they don&#39;t think you<br/>\nare doing anything.  Also, seeing you with your drum (stick) and no weapons<br/>\n(no exaggereatedly huge sionaches or breathe of harmony), they think you are<br/>\nnot contributing.  So then you can tell them that your 3 chants do about<br/>\n1800 dmg per minute. And ya, 60 levels later, 210 days and still explaining<br/>\nto the groups: &quot;... my bard mana song *is* the same as Clarity-2, the &#39;you<br/>\nfeel smaller&#39; *adds* 35 AC to all of you, etc, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 10, 2001 9:34 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] all I can say is hmmmm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wondered about what is truly the most effective damage output.<br/>\nObviously what weapon you use is a major factor.  I do find that when I&#39;m in<br/>\na caster heavy group - its good to melee just to keep the mob parked and<br/>\naggroed if possible.  I &quot;only&quot; have a Nestrolo Tambo and have had decent<br/>\nratio weaps for some time (esp since Sunday with my new Guardians Mace) -<br/>\nbut when I was using a Blood Runed Short Sword (9/18) and a Sioniches<br/>\nPartisan (9/19) Tried both weaps and chants in The Hole and the party &quot;felt&quot;<br/>\nthat I did more damage with the weapons.  Also this was at level 54 - and<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that is a major factor on chant damage output as well...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was FAR from scientific - but was kind of interesting none-the-less.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
