It was<br/>\ntypically 4% to 12%, with spikes over 60%.  I found that this made it<br/>\npractically impossible to stay invisible with Shauri&#39;s.  (I am level<br/>\n31 and have a wind skill of 158 or better, so under normal conditions,<br/>\nit&#39;s not a problem.)  However, although I often saw the blue &quot;You have<br/>\nbecome visible&quot; message, it rarely--if ever--followed the red &quot;You<br/>\nfeel yourself starting to appear&quot; message.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m speculating that the client is trying to get a packet through that<br/>\nsays &quot;Hey!  I&#39;m still singing Shauri&#39;s.&quot;  However, if this packet<br/>\nkeeps disappearing into the ether, then the song interval times out on<br/>\nthe server, and the server figures I&#39;ve stopped singing, so I become<br/>\nvisible.  Eventually, the client manages to get the packet through,<br/>\nand a soft mist surrounds me again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any event, the lessons I learned are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When it says &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear,&quot; you probably<br/>\n   won&#39;t become visible.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) When it doesn&#39;t say &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear,&quot; you<br/>\n   still may very well become visible.<br/>\n<br/>\nPurna Hodari of Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
