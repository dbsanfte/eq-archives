Granted, we&#39;re not talking about<br/>\n&gt; a lot of damage here, but I&#39;ve been in battles<br/>\n&gt; that were evenly matched hp to hp where I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; won with only a few hitpoints (&lt;10) left. Those<br/>\n&gt; initial 5-10+ points that would have been<br/>\n&gt; done could make / break the fight. (Please don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tell me I should have ran. Many times I&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; an NPC down to their last bubble when they<br/>\n&gt; turned into Rocky friggin Balboa on me and<br/>\n&gt; whipped my butt.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what the extra duration is for, to balance out<br/>\nthe lost damage during the pull </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
