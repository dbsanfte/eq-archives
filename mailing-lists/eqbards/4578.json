I<br/>\n&gt;restarted as Arden the Bard but this time I put all my points into STR.  I<br/>\n&gt;truly think it was worth it.  The STR stat is so much more helpful than any<br/>\n&gt;other stats for the classes that plan on wearing armor.  Banded will weigh<br/>\n&gt;you down but if you end up with Bronze then that will take most of the wgt<br/>\n&gt;you are allowed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mark<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Amazing $14,000 Opportunity.

I wrestle with the decision to restart<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my currently &quot;of the 11th Chorus.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t pump my strength all the way, I had decided when creating my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; character to &quot;play the bard&quot; -- which meant being a great singer /<br/>\n&gt;&gt; instrumentalist  and  being an extremely charismatic person.  So I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have 100 Dexterity and 100 Charisma.  My strength is only 80.  (I do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have the basic +2 ring from a jeweler friend, and a purity belt, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would really like to get some earmufflers!)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The first time I donned my banded tunic, I was awed by how good I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; look in it.  Admit it, how many characters get that golden armor look<br/>\n&gt;&gt; without resorting to bronze?  And then when you complete the outfit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (I actually hate the headpiece, so I never bought it), you get that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; golden/blue-boy look.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; But the damn thing was so heavy that you have to watch what you loot.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  And I was training my tailoring at the time.  Not to mention the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; inordinate amount of time it takes to loot your own corpse.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So, off goes the armor, into two backpacks in the bank, and I started<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my poaching-in-the-nude era.  That&#39;s also when I saw my Defense skill<br/>\n&gt;&gt; finally catch up with my level.  That&#39;s also when I first met Ness<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (who probably conned me red, inspected my inventory and found out I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wasn&#39;t wearing anything ...)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>\n&gt;&gt; monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; few times while I heal up.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>\n&gt;&gt; running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>\n&gt;&gt; HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>\n&gt;&gt; encumberance penalties.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Still, it would be nice to have 100 strength in the first place, just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so I can walk to the inn instead of crawling.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Pheh.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find some more strength boosting items soon.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just need to make money now.....<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Quit on Stormtower?  NEVER!  Well ... not a second time ...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (My original character was Sturmtower, who reached level 4 before I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; decided that agility doesn&#39;t do as much as dexterity.  I didn&#39;t twink<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -- there was nothing to twink at that level anyway.  But ol&#39;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Stormtower _is_ not really the original.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Stormtower of the 11th Chorus<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a very happy new owner of a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and subsequently cash poor<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt;...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
