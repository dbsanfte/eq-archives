I couln&#39;t use it for<br/>\nsquat at 8th lvl, but at 29, I pull with ease.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t used it on more than 2 mobs at a time<br/>\nsuccessfully though...<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many of our songs, lament gets better with age.  Here is a prime example of<br/>\nLament&#39;s usefulness.  I know of several high level bards (45+) on E&#39;ci who have<br/>\nsuccessfully used Lament to break a completely spawned Lord room in LGuk.  In<br/>\nother words, they Lament the boks and pull the Lord by himself.  Risky? Sure.<br/>\nBut when it works its amazing.  This is probably the extreme example of the<br/>\nusefulness of this song, at least in the pre-Kunark zones. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
