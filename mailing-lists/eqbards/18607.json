I&#39;m in the midst of trying to do a new quest that has been<br/>\n&gt; found in Firiona Vie.  I was hoping that someone here could give me<br/>\n&gt; some help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you hail Glinya Sweetpie (she sells baking items and food/water)<br/>\n&gt; she mentions someone named Treekill.  If you ask her about him, she<br/>\n&gt; says something to the effect of he&#39;s been tring to court her and she<br/>\n&gt; told him to bring her a Burynai Bunt Cake to put him off.  Asking her<br/>\n&gt; about the Bunt Cake, she says that there&#39;s no such thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a wandering guard named Scout Treekill.  If you hail him, he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t say anything, but the text mentions a helm hanging from his<br/>\n&gt; belt.  If you ask him about the helm, he says that he took it from a<br/>\n&gt; bard he had to beat up because he was singing Drow songs.  (This has<br/>\n&gt; been mentioned on this list, I believe)  Asking him about Glinya<br/>\n&gt; Sweetpie, He says that he&#39;s courting her and that she had asked him to<br/>\n&gt; bring her the bunt cake.  Asking him about the bunt cake gives you<br/>\n&gt; this text (from my screenshot):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scout Treekill gets excited.  What?!! Do you know how to bake a<br/>\n&gt; Burynai Bunt Cake.  Glinya said she would marry me if I baked one!!<br/>\n&gt; She won&#39;t let me use her oven so I had to search for one.  I finally<br/>\n&gt; located one in some goblin mine, but I can&#39;t find the recipe or bake.<br/>\n&gt; Please!! I would give you this bards helm for a Burynai Bunt Cake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is what I have deduced from this passage.  The Bunt Cake requires<br/>\n&gt; the baking skill.  There is an oven in the Mines of Droga where it<br/>\n&gt; must be baked.  Now, I am not a baker, so I&#39;m asking here if anyone<br/>\n&gt; might know the recipe for this?  Is there anyone else who might be<br/>\n&gt; working on this that can give me any leads?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks guys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robynn Merrilin<br/>\n&gt; Bard at Large on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; Currently: Level 41<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Katy Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\n&gt; CS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; 72% off on Name brand Watches!<br/>\n&gt; Come and buy today and get free shipping!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958398059/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/451022/_/958398059/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; *--- FREE VOICEMAIL FOR YOUR HOME PHONE! ---*<br/>\n&gt; With eVoice Now you can keep in touch with clients, vendors, co-workers,<br/>\n&gt; friends and family ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
