In<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;frustration I moved out of the keep into the pass, and subsequently died<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a VERY nasty Dark Elf NPC in one of the Inns.  I realize this is<br/>\n&gt;requesting<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a spoiler, but when I died to the NPC last night I lost my level, and am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;pretty frustrated at this point.  E-mail privately if you wish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The guy selling the bard songs in High Hold is standing in front of a<br/>\n&gt;picture a few rooms away from the bank.  I can&#39;t give any better directions<br/>\n&gt;than that, but that should be enough for you to find him if you search a<br/>\n&gt;bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to TOWERSHIGH, our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
