I struggled greatly through levels 12-14 with level 15 being<br/>\nthe most difficult of all.  Level 15 took longer than 1-14 put together.<br/>\nI&#39;d say I group about 60-70% of the time I play for experience, but contrary<br/>\nto my expectations and suggestions here, I actually found soloing became a<br/>\nvery viable way to get experience from 18-21.  I am currently still 21st<br/>\nbecause I haven&#39;t had time to play in a couple weeks with the holidays and<br/>\nsuch.  I have found that if I am careful I can solo whites in S Karana and<br/>\neasily solo most blues there.  I remember at 15 having trouble soloing<br/>\ngreens.  In just a two person group we were able to take down aviaks that<br/>\nwere red to us with little trouble.  same was true at level 19 with tentacle<br/>\nterrors in Najena.  It will get harder around 15th, but hang in there, after<br/>\nthat it will get easier at least thru 21st.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jason Sanderson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moxy1@...\">moxy1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player (maybe a couple<br/>\nhours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>\nWill leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>\neach new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>\nhopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>\nmobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or harder to level<br/>\nin the early teens compared to later levels..  <br/>\nAlso, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>\ncamping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>\nleave....<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nReed<br/>\n13 lvl  Bard of S Ro..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways carry a flagon of whiskey in case of snakebite and furthermore<br/>\nalways carry a small snake. - W.
