Hmmm - yes and no.  Each level higher you get<br/>\n&gt;takes more xp imho.  Some levels are by design twice as hard as regular<br/>\n&gt;levels - they are called the &quot;Hell&quot; levels: 30, 35, 40 and 45 (imho 50 is<br/>\n&gt;the ultimate Hell as well) but the teens are real tough for bards as well.<br/>\n&gt;But it can get easier if you get into groups and if you can form a team<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;plays together on a regular basis - it will be easier and more fun.  You<br/>\n&gt;should find a guild that you like and that has players who play at your<br/>\n&gt;level and at your same amount of time in the game.   The last time I was<br/>\n&gt;able to do &quot;a level in a day&quot; was back at level 24 for me.  It was hard to<br/>\n&gt;do even though I could always do it before if I set my mind to it and<br/>\n&gt;endured long camps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I hate camping too!  It&#39;s dull and boring for the most part.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, it is a pretty big part of the game as you get older.   Most<br/>\n&gt;bards prefer to group and most groups will want to camp.  So, while it may<br/>\n&gt;be possible to get to high levels without camping, I do think it would take<br/>\n&gt;a lot longer and it would be a lot harder.  But you should play the game<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;way you are happy with it and don&#39;t do stuff that you don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So welcome and please feel free to tell us about your adventures and we are<br/>\n&gt;happy to help answer your questions ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 40th song<br/>\n&gt;somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Sanderson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moxy1@...\">moxy1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 27, 1999 7:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Do I ever have a chance at making<br/>\n&gt;high level?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Sanderson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moxy1@...\">moxy1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player<br/>\n&gt;(maybe a couple<br/>\n&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be<br/>\n&gt;taking longer...<br/>\n&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it<br/>\n&gt;take longer for<br/>\n&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each<br/>\n&gt;level, but<br/>\n&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better<br/>\n&gt;selection of<br/>\n&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or<br/>\n&gt;harder to level<br/>\n&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..<br/>\n&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?<br/>\n&gt;I hate<br/>\n&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I<br/>\n&gt;get bored and<br/>\n&gt; leave....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Reed<br/>\n&gt; 13 lvl  Bard of S Ro..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Always carry a flagon of whiskey in case of snakebite and<br/>\n&gt;furthermore<br/>\n&gt; always carry a small snake. - W.
