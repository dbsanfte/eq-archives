A friend of mine recently lost a Staff of the Observers in a<br/>\ntrade window bug.  He got an empty trade window with nothing in it somehow,<br/>\ndid not notice it was empty and put the staff in.  suddenly the window<br/>\ndisappeared with no one hitting trade or cancel and the staff was gone.<br/>\nDespite having only his word to go on he got the staff returned about 2<br/>\nweeks and 1-2 emails later.  I can&#39;t even get teleported to my corpse to<br/>\nloot it after I get a page fault.  I would have accepted that, even if I did<br/>\nlose xp.  They refused to even go that far &#39;cause I might be some hacker.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a hacker does &#39;get over&#39; and get a free rez or two who suffers?  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve been trying to figure out, supposedly they can&#39;t believe any of us<br/>\n&#39;cause some scammer might get by then, but since a free rez hurts no one,<br/>\nexcept maybe in the ego dept?  Why purposely hurt the known majority of<br/>\ninnocent customers?  Guess that tells us all where Verant&#39;s true motivation<br/>\nlies.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

Each<br/>\ntime all the player had to say is &quot;I found my corpse but couldn&#39;t target it<br/>\nto loot it&quot; And the corpses were moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I am splitting hairs here - because I guess it is a &quot;verifiable bug&quot;<br/>\nthat they couldn&#39;t loot their corpse.  However - with the Locate Corpse<br/>\nRod - they easily could - so if Verant wanted to play real tough they could<br/>\nrefuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever - it seems that their claims of trying to avoid favoritism is not<br/>\ncorrect - and they are being far from consistent..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 06, 1999 1:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had a similar experience when my wife&#39;s character died from a 131hp fall<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings!
