I had thought I had read the the <br/>\nOS effect did 75 damage, but I only proc&#39;d once last night for 30. The <br/>\neffect is very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the dilemma.  A rogue offered me a Polished Granite Tomahawk and a <br/>\nDragoon Dirk for the Shard.  Now personally I am leaning toward keeping the <br/>\nShard, but I know I could barter the PGT into either a good bit of plat <br/>\n(saving for steel plate) or a nice item or two.
