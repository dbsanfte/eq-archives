I, personally, wouldn t pay more than 100pp for one - ideally between 60 - 80pp.  I have, on occasion, been able to sell them for as high as 150pp - but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1812013581\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) How much should I auction for it and where? (I know it <br/>\n&gt; comes out of Najena)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I, personally, wouldn&#39;t pay more than 100pp for one - ideally between 60 -<br/>\n80pp.  I have, on occasion, been able to sell them for as high as 150pp -<br/>\nbut they&#39;re definitely not worth that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Is it better bang for the buck than a combine ls or scim?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you can get one for under 80pp then it is a better deal.  If people are<br/>\nonly selling them for 100+, but I would, personally, just pass on it.<br/>\nCombine Scim is a pretty decent weapon all things considered... you should<br/>\nbe able to get one of those for 40-50pp.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure about this... never camped or even owned a PGT.  Again, it all<br/>\ndepends on what you purchase the BLW for.  If it&#39;s too high, I might try for<br/>\nthe PGT.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Operaman<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meandering Maestro of the 15th Song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Attachments have been removed from this message]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
