Kind of a<br/>\ndissadvantage there because your heal song can&#39;t quite keep pace with full<br/>\npoison *yet*.   Against standard monsters that don&#39;t have a DOT effect<br/>\n(poison) you will fare much better because you will actually heal during the<br/>\nfight (rather than just holding your own against the poison, let alone the<br/>\ndmg the nasty is doing).<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it against a young kodiak or a sand scarab in NRO and see how they<br/>\ncompare.  I found that at 12th (when we get bellow) the all instrument<br/>\nattack started to be a little better than weapons especially in groups as<br/>\nthe tank wouldn&#39;t take much damage at all, if any.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting mobs that DoT is like fighting a mob that is 2 cons higher than<br/>\nnormal.  IE:  A white is as hard as a deep yellow *(almost red)* con.  A<br/>\nblue can be as hard as a white.  I didn&#39;t mess with asps until 12th when I<br/>\nhad the option to run away and blast them for a bit with bellow if I needed<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!  And get that Hand to Hand skill up :)  You will find that once<br/>\nyou get it up where your weapons skill is you have a much easier time of it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tunare@egroups.com\">tunare@egroups.com</a>&gt;; &quot;&#39;Sisterhood&#39;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sisterhood@...\">sisterhood@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 17, 2000 9:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] ...but it&#39;s still easier than playing a rogue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Greetings all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tried my first all-instrument attack last night.  I was battling blues<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the Southeast corner of West Commons and the Southwest corner of East<br/>\n&gt; Commons.  First I tried a giant spider in WC.  It took me down to two<br/>\n&gt; bubbles, but I won.  And I got hand to hand up to 3!  Woohoo!  So I tried<br/>\n&gt; another spider, which also took me down to two bubbles, and got hand to<br/>\nhand<br/>\n&gt; up to 4.  Then a ghoul showed up so I moved to EC and attacked an asp.<br/>\n&gt; Well, an &quot;asp&quot; got whooped alright, but it wasn&#39;t the snake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I retrieve my corpse and try another asp.  I show my wisdom by zoning<br/>\n&gt; before I die, but display my lack of intelligence by not leaving myself<br/>\n&gt; enough HPs to survive the poison.  I loose consciousness the minute I hit<br/>\n&gt; WC, never getting Hymn started.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DONG!  You have lost a level!  Welcome back to level 10, dummy!<br/>\n&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I retrieve my corpse and ditch the instruments in favor of my FS 1H<br/>\n&gt; slasher and kite shield (don&#39;t I feel twinked &lt;g&gt;) and look for some more<br/>\n&gt; spiders.  I attack one and another joins in.  I swear this is the first<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever seen a giant spider assist another.  I mean I know spiders are<br/>\n&gt; like that, but I&#39;ve just never seen it happen.  I&#39;ve also never noticed<br/>\n&gt; spiders stunning me before.  I just BARELY make the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back on the EC side I try my luck with another asp.  Wicked close, this<br/>\n&gt; battle.  I loose consciousness twice, but survive.  I search for another<br/>\n&gt; snake but instead find a lesser mummy.  So I head back to WC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An asp is there waiting for me.  I fair better with this one.  It&#39;s still<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; close call, but I don&#39;t loose consciousness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DING!  You have gained a level!  Welcome back to level 11!  Be more<br/>\ncareful<br/>\n&gt; this time, silly!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More careful?  Me?  Heh.  It occurs to me that if I can get my H to H<br/>\nskill<br/>\n&gt; (currently at 5) up to where my 1H slash skill is (57) that I might just<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; able to kick some asp.  WC is empty, so I zone back to EC and find another<br/>\n&gt; serpent.  The battle commences but is not looking promising.  So I ditch<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; lute mid-battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my<br/>\nlute<br/>\n&gt; and this time don&#39;t stop playing until about 2/3 of the way through the<br/>\n&gt; battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute and<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; time stop playing the moment I switched to 3rd person view and discover<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; actually found a nest of asps.  Run away!  Woohoo!  I equip my drum and<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; my asp out of there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back in WC I spy a spider creeping along.  I reequip my lute and this time<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t stop playing until...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back in Freeport a guildmate accuses me of hanging out at the tavern<br/>\n&gt; drinking.  Why anyone would assume I&#39;m at a tavern just because they keep<br/>\n&gt; seeing me in Freeport is beyond me.  But anyway, I run back to WC and<br/>\n&gt; reequip my lute just long enough to bonk myself on the head with it, then<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; put it away in favor of more conventional weaponry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another dead spider, another dead asp.  Things are looking up.  So I start<br/>\n&gt; thinking about that hand to hand skill again, wondering how much damage I<br/>\n&gt; *could* be doing.  Well...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Little miss bard<br/>\n&gt; did her shield discard<br/>\n&gt; and picked up her lute to play<br/>\n&gt; along came a spider<br/>\n&gt; with poison insider her<br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;Minstrel, this isn&#39;t your day&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I retrieve my corpse and equip my drum.  This time I don&#39;t stop playing<br/>\n&gt; until I reach the tavern.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; Evulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup<br/>\n&gt; Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.<br/>\n&gt; Install today:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2344/10/_/451022/_/958569117/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2344/10/_/451022/_/958569117/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
