I know that I have been overcharged for several items that I have<br/>\nbought, but I bought them anyway because I wanted them.  Kind of adds to the<br/>\nmystique of the game.  The item may not necessarily be worth that much to<br/>\nthe general populace, but to me it was worth every penny.  I have also<br/>\novercharged people for certain items.  For instance when I was a young lad<br/>\nme and my hunting partner were in Crushbone and we were trying to get a 2<br/>\nhanded dwarven axe off of Lord Darish (sp?) and he died doing it.  Well when<br/>\nwe went and sold it, we overcharged for it because we went through a lot to<br/>\nget it.  And we sold it.  :)  Just my 2 coppers worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurik Nitesong<br/>\n21st bard<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________<br/>\nRobert Maze, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert@...\">robert@...</a><br/>\nHardware/Network Support, MCP<br/>\nAccess Associates<br/>\nwww.accessassociates.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Keith G.
