After hitting the bank and grabbing an extra<br/>\n&gt; flute, I high tailed it into unrest to recovery my possessions. After<br/>\n&gt; getting my corpse and pulling it to the wall I discovered a potentially<br/>\n&gt; fatal bug for bards out there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had my mino horn equiped and was playing the invis song (as I often do<br/>\n&gt; while looting my corpse) As I retrieved my items I picked up my original<br/>\n&gt; mino horn from my corpse. At that precise moment, Shaurii&#39;s happened to<br/>\n&gt; pulse and...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shaurii&#39;s Sonorus Clouding stopped and said you must have a wind<br/>\n&gt; instrument<br/>\n&gt; equpied.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What the???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I finished recovering my stuff and decided to test this extensively. Here<br/>\n&gt; are my limited conclusions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have Mino Horn A equiped and playing Shaurii&#39;s, then you pick up<br/>\n&gt; Mino<br/>\n&gt; Horn B and place it on your pointer, then your song pulses, your song will<br/>\n&gt; drop citing your lack of a wind instrument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As of yet I have not tried any of this with actual flutes yet, but I was<br/>\n&gt; able to replicate this bug over and over again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, the moral of the story is, if you are looting while invis in a<br/>\n&gt; dangerous<br/>\n&gt; area, be careful about picking up that wind instrument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
