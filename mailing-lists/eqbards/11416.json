How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, besides The<br/>\n&gt;lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests.

But also <br/>\nremember, we are the class most likely to be able to do ANY quest...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Items<br/>\n&gt;Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they added a grand<br/>\n&gt;total of 5<br/>\n&gt;Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They need millions.  Pathetic grunt-punchers ;)  Seriously, though - most <br/>\nof what is considered &quot;Bard-specific&quot; as near as I can tell (besides <br/>\nImbrued and Lambent armour) is magical instruments.  So, true, we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave much... but... um.. neither do Monks or Rogues (I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love <br/>\n+10 daggers of penetrating or Magical boots of kicking booty...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far distances through your<br/>\n&gt;pet<br/>\n&gt;Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;d be surprised how far a critter can teleport in 10 seconds...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>\n&gt;Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now.

Dunno there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Added New Bard Songs<br/>\n&gt;New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hrm - Well, we *JUST* got a new song, I think, on the test server...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>\n&gt;I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope - originally, it was a Monk-only ability.  Now we can do it with magic <br/>\ngloves, or with an instrument in our hands.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;+ Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>\n&gt;Fifil&#39;s, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, only a decrease<br/>\n&gt;(IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be a negative in<br/>\n&gt;here?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think he was counting &quot;unintentional&quot; nerfs....<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
