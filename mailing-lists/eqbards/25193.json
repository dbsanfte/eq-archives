Chant of battle at 51 is 30 str and dex with a<br/>\nhand drum.<br/>\nWith Nostolo tamborine it is 37 str and dex<br/>\nWith Walrus skin drum it is 39 str and dex<br/>\nGuess that makes it about even with sharksin drum and on eq prices that is<br/>\naround 3k.  But for the money, I think it would be cheaper to just buy your<br/>\ntamborine quest coins and get that.  Better graphic too.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
