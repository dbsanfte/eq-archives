We all got a good laugh<br/>\nand I said, &quot;when it stands back up, attack it...if you get in trouble I&#39;ll<br/>\nrecharm it and let you heal up.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the skeleton broke charm and my two friends proceeded to beat the<br/>\nmarrow of it.  Keep in mind I have not struck the skeleton one, just charmed<br/>\nit.  The fight lasted about a minute and the skeleton never stopped hitting<br/>\nme the whole time...it had absolutely no concern whatsoever that there were<br/>\ntwo con green PCs standing behind it killing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hmmmmm....&quot; I thought, and I helped my two friends get to their next level<br/>\nkilling one yellow after another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think charm has mem blur, doesn&#39;t it? I once saved myself from a KSing<br/>\nnuker in Highkeep by charming the gobbie he was trying to nuke while I was<br/>\nmeleeing.  Not knowing what was going on  he continued to blow mana on it,<br/>\nthen I let it break charm and finished it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 04, 2000 12:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Follow up questions to Arch-Magi <br/>\n&gt; Answers Volume V<br/>\n&gt; - 2.3.00<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 4 Feb 2000, Rokenn Swiftsong wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Q: Is Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a <br/>\n&gt; memory blur <br/>\n&gt; &gt; component?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A: Nope.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Follow up: The old spell lists from Beta indicate that <br/>\n&gt; Lullaby nix&#39;d the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hate list.

Its taunt effect was sufficient to pull mobs off<br/>\n&gt; others in most cases, but I never had an instance where I<br/>\n&gt; could &quot;rescue&quot; a random player being beat up by a mob by<br/>\n&gt; simply pulsing this song once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely <br/>\n&gt; trivial, the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; enameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate <br/>\n&gt; that is wearable <br/>\n&gt; &gt; by all the plate wearing classes except Bard.
