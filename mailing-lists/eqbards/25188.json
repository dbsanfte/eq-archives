I see why I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfind Tzeetch, I could not recall how to spelll the name! Anyways, I was<br/>\ntalking to Kaas about doing the undead bard/Trak. Seems that his guild,<br/>\nDeath Knights has a falling out with SoA (I haven&#39;t heard the dirt yet)<br/>\nand<br/>\nso they can&#39;t field enough folks to finish his epic. We were talking about<br/>\nguilds and people that he can talk to about helping do his last step. It<br/>\ndawned on me that he is pretty much in the same boat you guys are talking<br/>\nabout being in. So my question is, would it be possible for the guilds you<br/>\nguys are in to get involved? I&#39;m thinking we would end up with some DK&#39;s,<br/>\nsome Muffins, some Marauders of the Dragon and probably some of my bunch,<br/>\nVenator Sapentia. I&#39;m sure Kaas&#39;s bunch would agree to help you guys do<br/>\nGore. Now granted, there&#39;s alot of luck involved. The day/time you catch<br/>\nGore or the undead bard or whatever red dragon up may not be the day<br/>\neveryone is on or is free to drop whatever. I would have liked to go do<br/>\nTrak for Kaas last night if the bard was up but was committed to helping<br/>\nAnnelia and Sybian in Fear with their epics. This has more to do with<br/>\nmeeting more people of the right level and mindset as a start. I&#39;d like to<br/>\nsee all the bards I know get their epics and I will help whenever I can.<br/>\nWe can coordinate via our ezboard if you like. I told Kaas to go start a<br/>\nthread on our general board but don&#39;t see it yet. What do you guys think?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
