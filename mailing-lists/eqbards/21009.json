Woulda been more,<br/>\nbut in an earlier pull a froggie shaman got into the mix :o/  )<br/>\nAll I do is run around and grab some pups, go back to my lil spot (using the<br/>\nrocks as a marler for when to turn), aand begin juggling DoTs.  When one<br/>\ndies, I switch views, target another, then do it again, rinse and repeat<br/>\nuntil all pups are dead.
