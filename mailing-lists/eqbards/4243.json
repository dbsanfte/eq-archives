Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>\n&gt; attack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>\n&gt; not stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>\n&gt; attack another mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>\n&gt; this happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>\n&gt; mob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>\n&gt; re-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>\n&gt; charmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>\n&gt; attacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were almost killed by a cyclops last night because a stupid<br/>\n&gt; kodiak tagged along and I wasted time trying to charm it to<br/>\n&gt; take it out of the fight and it kept right on attacking.<br/>\n&gt; (OTOH my ranger friend was absolutely ecstatic when the<br/>\n&gt; cyclops frenzied on him, got him down to one bubble as the<br/>\n&gt; cleric went OOM, and I charmed the cyclops to pull it off<br/>\n&gt; him.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
