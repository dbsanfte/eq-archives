Normally I agree<br/>\nthat binding is fairly easy to acquire, but that is not always the case.  If<br/>\nyou have ever ventured to Erudin you you will understand my meaning.  I have<br/>\nbeen to Erudin three times now and all three times there were less than 6<br/>\npeople on the entire continent, none of whom could bind.  I had Erudin all<br/>\nto myself and Kerra Isle as well.  It was very depressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso worry not about the English, it sounded better than that spoken by many<br/>\nwho call it their first language!

I particulary think it would<br/>\nmake sense,<br/>\n       Even if not bind forever, it could have binded a few days, instead i<br/>\nhave to buy, &quot;or beg to buy&quot; someone else bind !!!<br/>\n<br/>\n                        []&#39;s Kel.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.: Sorry for the poor english..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\nFor program details, go to<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
