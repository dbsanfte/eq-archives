A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-761104168\">The only times I have ever used the Cancel Magic songs in a combat situation<br/>\nis when fighting spiders in the Dreadlands to get rid of their damage<br/>\nshield.  A caster with Nullify magic can get rid of the entire damage shield<br/>\nin one fell swoop.  I would have to sing Cancel Magic a couple of times<br/>\nbefore it was completely removed.  So damage shields have the counters like<br/>\nShada mentioned.  Not certain which other spell effects have counters.<br/>\nSeems kinda strange that an illusion would have a counter though.  When I<br/>\nhave used Cancel Magic to remove DE illusion, I would get the &quot;static pulse&quot;<br/>\nmessage (i.e. I didn&#39;t resist myself) but the illusion remained in effect.<br/>\nOnly after using Cancel Magic a couple of times would it go away.  BTW I<br/>\nthink Shada may be right that Cancel Magic is unresistable.  When I first<br/>\ngot my Nostrolos Tamborine, I tried the various Chant songs on myself to see<br/>\nhow much damage they did.  It took me several attempts to finally get a<br/>\nChant to stick.  With the Cancel Magic song, I get the &quot;static pulse&quot;<br/>\nmessage indicating success every time I have used it on myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I have is do both of our songs that remove spell effects work<br/>\nin the same manner (with the exception that one affects the entire party<br/>\nwhile one is targetted).  In other words, if I want to get rid of root, do<br/>\nboth of them give me the same chance?  I have a feeling that Disenchanting<br/>\nMelody picks a random effect to remove while Cancel Magic removes the one at<br/>\nthe top of your screen.  Does anyone know for certain?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 11, 2001 1:01 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Dispelling...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni thought dispels were unresistable, but certain spell effects had X number<br/>\nof counters and you need to dispel X number of times to get them off.  but<br/>\nthe short answer is yes, both of our dispel songs removed effects on us<br/>\n(positive or negative) other than illusions before patch.  i haven&#39;t tried<br/>\nsince.  i&#39;m not sure if it goes in order on your effects box or what order<br/>\nthey were cast on you or if it&#39;s random.  i thought they made it random<br/>\naround the same type they made Vox and Nag AE dispel.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem with using our Cancel Magic song to remove spell <br/>\n&gt; effects is that<br/>\n&gt; it checks against your MR.  I think, but am not 100% certain, <br/>\n&gt; that Cancel<br/>\n&gt; Magic will always remove the first spell effect.  So if you <br/>\n&gt; are rooted, in<br/>\n&gt; order to get rid of it the root icon needs to be listed <br/>\n&gt; first.  Then the<br/>\n&gt; song has to actually succeed a MR check.  When I want to remove my DE<br/>\n&gt; illusion, I usually have to try 2-3 times before the song sticks. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
