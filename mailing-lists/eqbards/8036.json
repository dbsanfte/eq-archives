I don&#39;t understand the logic behind it at all.  If they did it because<br/>\nwe&#39;re infringing upon the powers of the enchanter, why the heck did they<br/>\ngive it to us in the first place?  It&#39;s okay for us to Charm any MOB below<br/>\nlevel 37, but out of the question for us to Charm level 38+.  If it is an<br/>\n&quot;infringement&quot; issue, why then isn&#39;t Chain capped, or Fear, etc.  Those two<br/>\nsongs are infringing upon the other classes, and they are much more<br/>\nefficient and effective.  It doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with Charm<br/>\nitself - it could have been any one of our songs.  Why give us something<br/>\nthat we can&#39;t use for the remainder of our careers (that we&#39;ve fought so<br/>\nhard to attain)??  I don&#39;t know of any other spell, skill or ability that is<br/>\n&quot;capped&quot; in this manner (actually, I&#39;ve heard that the Enchanter charms are<br/>\nlevel capped, but they get new ones to replace the old).  And what about the<br/>\nalleged level 75 expansion?  The song will be doubly worthless when that<br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 11:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Mesmerize vs. Charm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Oct 06/99, David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as I know, Pixie Strike does not clear the &quot;sh*t list&quot; in any<br/>\nmanner.<br/>\n&gt; If I pixie strike a large rat, as soon as it&#39;s un-stunned/un-mezzed, it<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; bee-line for me.  If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the<br/>\nVeil<br/>\n&gt; that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could<br/>\nnever<br/>\n&gt; reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>\n&gt; would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be<br/>\nmostly<br/>\n&gt; useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also,<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; (even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>\n&gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely<br/>\nkeep<br/>\n&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>\n&gt; screech, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why, later in a bard&#39;s life, it becomes very frustrating when<br/>\nyou discover you can&#39;t charm a mob over 38. Pixie Strike is a very poor<br/>\nsubstitute for what I mainly used charm for. Casters seem to be able to<br/>\ncast fine while lullaby&#39;d so that&#39;s pretty useless as a replacement, and<br/>\nscreech can be suicide in some dungeons, especially lower guk where<br/>\nyou&#39;ll probably spend a lot of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, enjoy charm while you&#39;ve got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
