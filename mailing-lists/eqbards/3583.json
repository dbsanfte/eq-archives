But I went in pretty far<br/>\nand the only non-green I saw was a Shin warrior and a Gaz Shaman.  Maybe a<br/>\nparty had just traipsed thru, but there were only 5 people there.  3 30+<br/>\npeople, a lvl 9 troll and me at 15th.  No party opportunities there.  Went<br/>\nback and saw 12 people.  6 over 30 again, a party of Trolls, all very evil,<br/>\naround 20, 2 dark elves at 16 and me.  I understand there are higher level<br/>\nfroggies farther in, but what good are the other ones as no one hunts them.<br/>\nAnd no, being a tailor and therefore generally poor, woven isn&#39;t trash loot<br/>\nto me.  Mesh is what I was really after to replace all my leather until I<br/>\nget reinforced made.
