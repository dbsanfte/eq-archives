All I&#39;m saying is that you said yourself vox<br/>\n&gt;&gt; killled the raiders. I&#39;ve seen dragosn done two ways, the dragon gets<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spawked or the raiders get spanked doesn&#39;t seem to be a medium.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Did I say that?  My mistake... Oh wait, I just read all my sent mail.<br/>\n&gt;  I never said that people died.  Oops, your mistake.  My guess is<br/>\n&gt;  90% of the people made it out alive.  The people who were slain<br/>\n&gt;  were the pet masters who were a little too careless.  If we fought<br/>\n&gt;  the dragon and lost, that one thing.  I&#39;m not ashamed to say we<br/>\n&gt;  got spanked, but no one f&#39;ing fought the dragon dude, heh.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  the point you seem to miss.  Had the dominate server guild not<br/>\n&gt;  stormed in and taken over, the 90% of the people alive would have<br/>\n&gt;  regrouped and beat up Vox.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt;To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
