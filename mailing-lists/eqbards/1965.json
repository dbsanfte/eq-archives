The Prophet was VERY easy to kill. Dvinn -<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even consider it. I paired up with a L24 druid the first go<br/>\n&gt; around to get a Dragoon Dirk, and the only reason Dvinn died was<br/>\n&gt; because the druid was a monster. DVinn was 19th-20th everytime we<br/>\n&gt; spawned. Even splitting the exp with a L24, I got literally a quarter<br/>\n&gt; bubble exp off of him. The Dragoon Dirk however is an awesome weapon,<br/>\n&gt; and is even better then the Combine long sword I used. It seems with<br/>\n&gt; alot of these that bronze armor puts you over the edge in taking hits<br/>\n&gt; from them, I was still in 90% banded when I went, and wielded a<br/>\n&gt; Combine LS and a FS LS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  These two are found elsewhere and are of note, because they can get<br/>\n&gt; hard to kill at lower levels...

He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good reason<br/>\n&gt; to ice him. The rest of the crew to be found around (in order from<br/>\n&gt; easiest to kill to hardest to kill IMO) are Pawns, Centurion, Oracles,<br/>\n&gt; Slavers, and Legionnaires. At your level, this will pretty much be the<br/>\n&gt; meat of your hunting. If you are soloing, don&#39;t even step foot on the<br/>\n&gt; island that has the castle unless you&#39;ve got your drums at the ready.<br/>\n&gt; My piece of advice...Learn where the Legionnaire&#39;s spawn and avoid<br/>\n&gt; (unless you can take a Legionnaire) and avoid the mine unless you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; with a group, or there is already one camped inside. Occasionally if<br/>\n&gt; you kill a slaver, they drop keys. Use these keys to gain the<br/>\n&gt; appreciation of the slaves scattered around the area. If you give a<br/>\n&gt; slave a copper piece, he will read the number of his shackles so you<br/>\n&gt; can match the keys up....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; WOW! I didn&#39;t know about the copper.
