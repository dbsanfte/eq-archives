Once you reach about L10, sense heading<br/>\nstarts to max out just through normal use.  Forage is nice,<br/>\nbut I find it more convenient to buy 20 grapes and flasks of<br/>\nwater and just not worry about it.  It saves me weight, time,<br/>\nand inventory space, and the cost is really negligible at<br/>\nlater levels (less than 1pp for two night&#39;s supply roughly).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also play a druid and a monk so my setup is a bit of a<br/>\nconcession to keeping things consistent between all three.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first bank is made of skills/commands.  Sense heading,<br/>\nforage, hide, sneak, sit, bind wounds.  I will probably<br/>\nreplace hide with the spellbook once I get the invisibility<br/>\nsong (so I don&#39;t have to switch out of full-screen just to<br/>\nchange songs).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second bank has the two melee slots on top and four<br/>\ninventory slots for holding weapons and my instruments.  I<br/>\nwould say three inventory slots are the minimum (two weapons<br/>\nor weapon/shield, drum, lute).  That makes a total of five,<br/>\nand at that point I figured heck, just make it six.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third bank has six primary songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fourth bank has my ranged attack (rarely used now that I<br/>\nhave bellow), the two remaining songs, and assist.  The reason<br/>\nI keep all 8 songs macroed is because you can rearrange them<br/>\nwithout leaving the full-screen mode.  Just pick one up and<br/>\nexchange it with another.  e.g. I usually keep lullaby,<br/>\nbellow, accelerando, and restoration in the third bank.  The<br/>\ntwo remaining slots I usually swap between anthem, whistling<br/>\nwarsong, and guardian and elemental rhythms.  If we&#39;re<br/>\nfighting primarily melee mobs, I&#39;ll keep anthem and whistling<br/>\nwarsong on bank 3.  If a spellcaster pops up, it just takes me<br/>\na couple seconds to swap in guardian rhytms for the warsong<br/>\nand everything I need to twist is still on bank 3.  If we&#39;re<br/>\nfacing nasty spellcasting critters (like things that can<br/>\ncharm), I&#39;ll add elemental rhythms to the mix, demoting bellow<br/>\nor restoration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should probably use the other slots for /who friends all and<br/>\nother inane social stuff since I seem to be doing that quite<br/>\noften.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
