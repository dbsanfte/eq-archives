To recap, I have never killed a live froglok so they are<br/>\n&gt;not KOS towards me.  In theory, that combined with the invis song will <br/>\n&gt;allow<br/>\n&gt;me to go through Upper Guk safely.  However, once I get into Lower Guk the<br/>\n&gt;undead frogloks will still attack me.  I discussed my plan with my<br/>\n&gt;guildmembers last night and some of them told me that even with Invis to<br/>\n&gt;Undead, my chances of safely going to Lower Guk to loot a Guise were not<br/>\n&gt;good.  I was told told that the undead frogloks can sometimes see through<br/>\n&gt;Invis to Undead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Getting through upper guk should be possible even without invisibility if <br/>\nyou have never killed a frog before. I do it all the time with my low level <br/>\ndruid.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust FYI, waiting around by the zone line is NOT safe in the deadside of <br/>\nlower Guk. People are constantly training monsters of all types there. The <br/>\nmain problem - if you are attacked by a ghoul there is a chance you will be <br/>\nrooted. If you get rooted, you probably will be running back to get your <br/>\ncorpse shortly after. Course this all depends on who you are with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Invis vs Undead  is concerned, I have yet to experience any of the <br/>\nundead SEEING THROUGH my invisibility (maybe some of the ghoul wizards <br/>\npossibly might be able to)...however, just like ANY invisibility spell, it&#39;s <br/>\nvery unreliable. It can easily wear off at the wrong time, and I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nthis happen too many times to count. Just make sure you avoid vampire bats, <br/>\ndeadly black widows, and gargoyles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;can someone give me the<br/>\n&gt;directions I should take?  Invis to undead doesn&#39;t last very long so thats <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;big factor.  Would I have time to run back to the zone border if attacked<br/>\n&gt;while looting?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way to get to wear the mask is dropped is hard to explain. It would be <br/>\nbest to follow an experienced person there. If you are lucky you will make <br/>\nit alive. If you get trained anywhere after the bedroom you will probably <br/>\nnot make it out unless you get Succored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;24 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad of Quellious &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
