All went smoothly<br/>\n&gt; (despite the fact that I had an idiot cleric), and Naggy was soon dead,<br/>\n&gt; dropping a CoF and an orb among other things.  When it came time to<br/>\n&gt; random the cloak, the rule was this--anyone who was a tank was in, and<br/>\n&gt; anyone who would not actually use it should remove their name from the<br/>\n&gt; lotto.  Being a bard, not a true tank, I removed myself from the lotto.<br/>\n&gt; The other bard on the run, however, did *not* remove herself.  As a<br/>\n&gt; result, the two people who had brought me put my name back on the list,<br/>\n&gt; against my wishes.  Random happens and guess what?  The little bard has<br/>\n&gt; won her first random ever (yeah, you heard right, in 15 months of EQ, I<br/>\n&gt; have never won a random).  Woo!  Brand new CoF.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don it, it is lovely, and then I hand it back.  Of all the people<br/>\n&gt; there, all the tanks who have been on 9, 10, even more Naggy runs and<br/>\n&gt; seen nothing even close, it went to a bard, who can barely use the haste<br/>\n&gt; in comparison with their double-attacking, quisinart selves.  My<br/>\n&gt; instructions were to re-random it, and not let the other bard in either.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps that was harsh, but if it was to go to a bard instead of a real<br/>\n&gt; tank, it should be the one who won, not the greedy latecomer (she did not<br/>\n&gt; show up until about time to random the mith greaves...hmm).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luckily for me, an orb also dropped, and the other bard already had one<br/>\n&gt; (as this particular group does bards before casters for orbs), so I got a<br/>\n&gt; nice toy anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I want to know is how many people here agree with what I did, and<br/>\n&gt; how many think I am just plain nuts (or both)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -High Lady Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\n&gt; Guildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a> (temporarily down, will be up soon)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; YOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\n&gt; Juno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\n&gt; Try it today - there&#39;s no risk!
