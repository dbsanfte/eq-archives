Has anyone yet tested the Mystical Lute to see if there is a<br/>\nsignificant bonus to stringed songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust a thought......<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLago Bardoon, Bertox Bard of the 37th Composition, Defenders of<br/>\nAleria<br/>\n\t_--------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Here is what I posted to my guild re: the bard quest wep:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&quot;If it takes 2 dragon scales to get this thing vs using those same scales<br/>\n&gt; (and time and effort to obtain same) for warrior quests, I&#39;d think we&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; better off equiping our warriors with weapons that they can use as opposed<br/>\n&gt; to a cute toy that a bard might equip in the off-hand when he&#39;s not using<br/>\n&gt; his drum. Instruments, especially the Dragon grade ones eg: Selo&#39;s Drums,<br/>\n&gt; are still the &quot;uber&quot; bard weapons for both damage as well as buffs and<br/>\n&gt; resists.&quot;&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Verant should have made an instrument good enough so that even Shada would<br/>\n&gt; use it (instead of swords &lt;g&gt;) -- now that would be &quot;Uber&quot; - truly.  The<br/>\n&gt; mention of it being an &quot;off-hand weapon&quot; is from Aftathott&#39;s evaluation of<br/>\n&gt; the wep and it&#39;s proc. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What good is &quot;The Vision&quot; when it makes you blind to some basic things:<br/>\n&gt; Bards, songs, instruments.  Because instruments are class specific to<br/>\n&gt; bards,<br/>\n&gt; they should be _the_ defining items for us.  Some combination of songs and<br/>\n&gt; instruments should be the focus of the bard&#39;s power and be the basis of<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; power - imho.  I guess I should be mad or dissappointed at Verant but I am<br/>\n&gt; some where between &quot;numb&quot; and uninterested.  Was it said in the design<br/>\n&gt; meeting: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s *make* bards compete with warriors for their quest<br/>\n&gt; items - that fits with the part of the Vision where...&quot;, or was it: &quot;Shit!<br/>\n&gt; Tell them to delay the update!!  We forgot to make a quest for bards -<br/>\n&gt; let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; give &#39;em some kinda sword with musical notes floating around...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly, the bard!~ <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 01, 2000 11:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQ Bards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bard Uber-Quest Weapon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway - Saw the blurb on EQVault - info on the guild Afterlife website at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=sss\">http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=sss</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
