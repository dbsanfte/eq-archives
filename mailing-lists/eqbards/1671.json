The spell effect on it goes up as<br/>\n&gt; you level, increasing STR, but also decreasing AGI .  After a while, that<br/>\n&gt; AGI loss pretty much negates the magic skin(which doesn&#39;t go up in the<br/>\n&gt; amount of damage it can absorb), and keep in mind that while skinned, you<br/>\n&gt; can still be bashed and run stunned.  Either one stops your songs cold, and<br/>\n&gt; can get you killed at the wrong time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s some interesting points in this note, some of which seems to be at odds<br/>\nwith what other players have been telling me, particularly about the &quot;magic<br/>\nskin&quot; effect not increasing in the amount of damage it soaks up as you get<br/>\nhigher in level, but since I have no experience, I won&#39;t argue with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to note though, the tomahawk&#39;s effect no longer stops or locks up your<br/>\nsong, which is good news for bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else you didn&#39;t mention which I think is important is that the<br/>\ntomahawk is really a tank&#39;s weapon.  The strength from the effect is nice, but<br/>\nyou&#39;re really using that thing for the invulnerability, and if you&#39;re just a<br/>\nhitter in your group and not the one taking most of the damage, then the<br/>\ntomahawk would be much better off being a barbed leather whip or some other more<br/>\nefficient weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
