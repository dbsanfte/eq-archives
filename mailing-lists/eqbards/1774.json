Unlike the invis song, hide and sneak works <br/>\nfor every type of monsters.  Yes even the ones that see through the invis <br/>\nsong.  And for hide, once you are hidden, you won&#39;t be visible until you <br/>\nunhide or move.  The invis song will ocassionally skip a beat, which could <br/>\nbe deadly if you are afk and a wander by mob starts to hit on you.  Another <br/>\nbenefit of hide is that you can actually hide from a creature that you have <br/>\nattacked!  I have seen this work for a few rogue friends of mine and it <br/>\nsaved their lives.  If you walk in a dungeon and see a bunch of mobs moving <br/>\naround look like they are chasing someone but no one is in sight.  They are <br/>\nprobably after a hidden PC.  Rogues used this skill to heal themselves to <br/>\nfull before escaping the train.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I wish we have are higher skill caps on both of these skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is what has me convinced that sneak and hide are two completely <br/>\n&gt;useless<br/>\n&gt;skills for a bard.  I&#39;ve not once used them as I am constantly singing some<br/>\n&gt;sort of song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS - Hail to Berk and Infiniti, it&#39;s good to see some familiar faces on the<br/>\n&gt;board<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ka`Lend, 27th Wood Elven Bard on Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
