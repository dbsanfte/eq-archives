I charmed a<br/>\ncyclops there and had it fight another, and it was a royal<br/>\npain keeping out of range, staying away from other mobs, while<br/>\nkeeping the cyclops charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I like the entrance to Unrest.  I just wait for a<br/>\ntrain, then when everyone has zoned, just charm the stuff into<br/>\nfighting each other.  Mortuary Fungi are the best because<br/>\ntheir Mort Drowsy basically renders all melee mobs impotent -<br/>\neven if your charm expires, the Mort Drowsy is still in effect<br/>\nand the melee mobs will get few if any hits in on you before<br/>\nyou can recharm the Fungus.  Hags are good too, though a bit<br/>\ndifficult to control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to play around more with Griffins and Giants, as<br/>\nthey tend to be in nice, flat terrain.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
