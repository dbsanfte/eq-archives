","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-764309550\">He just posted part 3 - and it&#39;s got a lot more Bard-related stuff in it.<br/>\nAgain, for those who&#39;d rather not web-surf, I&#39;ve cut some tasty bits below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029945.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029945.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, is the Bard song Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby ever intended to be fixed? <br/>\nIt currently has  a 3 second duration and a roughly 60% resist rate. Even <br/>\nthose that are in favor of it the way it is admit that it requires a <br/>\ndedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it.  One resist causes <br/>\nthe monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly interrupt the song, and <br/>\nthen the Bard is more or less dead because all the monsters are going to be <br/>\nun-mesmerized in three seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Don&#39;t know, sorry. That&#39;s definitely a GZ question.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is it intended that Bards don&#39;t get any magical instruments until mid <br/>\n30s or higher?  If not, please examine the quests that give the <br/>\nunfound/missing instruments, they may be broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;ll ask GZ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi said players don&#39;t get indoor sow or selo&#39;s or any kind of speed <br/>\nbuff because in beta they caused a lot of trains. How about Mobs not <br/>\ngetting indoor sow etc? IMO sow&#39;d mobs cause more trains then any sow&#39;d <br/>\nplayers. If it is just to prevent trains please remove the ability of mobs <br/>\nto cast sow indoors.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I agree with Abashi, however that&#39;s not the biggest reason we don&#39;t allow <br/>\nSOW indoors. The biggest reason is SOW and similar spells were originally <br/>\nintended to only help with travel. They were not meant for kiting and such. <br/>\nSince dungeons, relative to outdoor zones, are much smaller, we designed it <br/>\nsuch that &#39;travel&#39; spells wouldn&#39;t work there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it within the vision to ignore all bard posts/concerns except the least <br/>\nimportant for two months straight? So far we still don&#39;t have any class <br/>\nspecific weapons and only two non-planar, non-dragon instruments that have <br/>\nan effect (and one is from Kedge and extremely rare).<br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;ll ask Abashi why he hasn&#39;t responded to &#39;bard posts&#39; if indeed truly <br/>\nhe hasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nAssistant Moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
