When I logged in on Saturday night, I<br/>\nwas about halfway through 26.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends of mine were hunting giants in Frontier Mountains, so I went to<br/>\njoin them. Fantastic group with an awesome monk puller who never stopped the<br/>\nwhole night. We took down giant after giant, and ended up looting lots of<br/>\ndecent stuff (40 - 60pp items) including a Forest Loop! Of course, I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwin that roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the evening progressed everyone decided it was time for bed. By this time<br/>\nI was a little less than half a bub from 27. No way I could go to bed<br/>\nwithout charm, so I trucked over the Lake of Ill Omen, and proceeded to<br/>\nding! Feeling satisfied with the evening I went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday afternoon I logged in and tried my hand at charm kiting. Oh the<br/>\nthrill! It was a blast and I made half a bub in about 45 minutes while<br/>\nlearning the ropes before I had to log off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat evening I logged back on and my friends were just showing up again for<br/>\nanother run at the mountain giants, so I joined them. Our monk was a pulling<br/>\nfanatic again, and another Forest Loop dropped! Much to my surprise, I won<br/>\nthe roll for it, and immediately got offer 2kpp for it from a guildmate<br/>\n(accepted this offer).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow after this nice windfall, I would like to ask my fellow bards for some<br/>\nhelp deciding what to upgrade in my equipment list. My current equipment is<br/>\nas follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nhead: Crown of the Froglok King (gift from a retiring RL friend)<br/>\nface: Small Bronze Mask<br/>\nleft ear: Opaline Earring<br/>\nright ear: Opaline Earring<br/>\nneck: Spiked Collar (or +3 cha necklace for charming)<br/>\nshoulder: BS Mantle<br/>\narms: Small Bronze Vambraces<br/>\nleft wrist: Lambent Bracer (or +7 cha bracelet for charming)<br/>\nright wrist: Lambent Bracer (or +7 cha bracelet for charming)<br/>\nhands: Small Bronze Gauntlets<br/>\nleft finger: Jagged Band<br/>\nright finger: Jagged Band<br/>\nchest: Small Bronze Breastplate (guildmate has a Lambent Breastplate for me)<br/>\nback: Polar Bear Cloak<br/>\nwaist: Thick Leather Apron<br/>\nlegs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\nfeet: Small Bronze Boots<br/>\n<br/>\nprimary weapon: Bladed Thulian Claw (or Gnoll Hide Lariat when in high melee<br/>\ngroup)<br/>\nsecondary weapon: Silvery War Axe (or Gnoll Hide Lariat when in high melee<br/>\ngroup)<br/>\nranged slot: Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n<br/>\nstring: Mandolin<br/>\npercussion: MM Drum<br/>\nwind: Minotaur Horn<br/>\nbrass: Horn <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the collar and cloak should be upgraded, but I&#39;m not sure what to go<br/>\nwith. I was thinking a Cloak of the Icebear maybe, but have no ideas on the<br/>\ncollar. Any other ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nCharming Fool of 27 Winces<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
