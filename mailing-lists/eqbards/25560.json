In a recent chat, Verant said that the Horse&#39;s<br/>\nwill have the approximate speed of J-Boots / T-Boots. If they were bring<br/>\nhorses on to help with travel times, a horse would be faster because if the<br/>\nhorses are going to be in the 15,000 platinum range if you can buy T-Boots<br/>\nfor 5,250 platinum? The real reason they are introducing horses is because<br/>\nVerant has always wanted horses and they think the horses they&#39;ve created<br/>\nlook GREAT.
