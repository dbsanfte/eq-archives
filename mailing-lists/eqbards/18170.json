I compared it to what the Concert Hall had listed and found there <br/>\nwere 4 more not shown on the Concert Hall List. They are:<br/>\n<br/>\nL53 Song of the Dawn, Wind<br/>\nL58 Jonathan&#39;s Inspiration, Brass<br/>\nL60 Angstilich&#39;s Assonance, Wind<br/>\nL60 Kazumi&#39;s Preservation, Brass<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a player was hunting a song called Boombastic Bellow for a quest, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get any details of what quest he was doing. An npc on one of the <br/>\ndocks sells a Box of Lute Strings, Unfinished Lute neck, raw bamboo, and one <br/>\nother flute part. I didn&#39;t find a bard GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nDreadlands: L40 yardtrash, all you can pull and more. I love this zone!<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
