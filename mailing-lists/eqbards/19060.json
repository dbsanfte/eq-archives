My guild and I have pretty<br/>\nmuch lived there for the last 3 weeks or so.  We have went to every part of<br/>\nthis dungeon and killed every mob there.  If you are in the high 30&#39;s to low<br/>\n40&#39;s, it is an outstanding place to hunt.  For a while we were the only<br/>\ngroups there.  There have been a few more people showing up lately, but it<br/>\nis still under utilized in my opinion.  There are several named mobs in here<br/>\nwhich drop some good loot for the level range.  Nearly everyone in the<br/>\nguild, 21 people, have gotten a dusty ransacker&#39;s pack.  A couple of the<br/>\nbooks, a nice 2h slashing weapon, warrior only piercer, and several of the<br/>\nbard only piercers.  So the loot is very well flowing.  If you plan on going<br/>\nto the church, bring two groups, if you are in the 40&#39;s, and DO NOT use<br/>\npets.  We were there last week, very well balanced groups that included two<br/>\nnecros and a shaman using pets.  Well everything went well, after I died 3<br/>\ntimes (another long story that I shan&#39;t go into now :)) and we made our way<br/>\ndown to the church.  We started pulling 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s, no problem with the<br/>\nbest enchanter on Veeshan IMHO, and we were going through them like candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the fun starts.  Out of nowhere we had 7 spiders on us.  Mind you there<br/>\nare no spiders down near the church.  We kill them and finish clearing the<br/>\nchurch.  We go in and set up camp in the basement.  We have a few pops, kill<br/>\nthem, have a few more, kill them, get some roamers, etc.  Then it happened.<br/>\nA pet disappears.  A spider comes, and another, and another and so forth and<br/>\nso on.  When we finally rest, we have killed over 35 mobs in a row.  They<br/>\njust kept flooding the place.  Very very scary being that far in a dungeon<br/>\nwith that many mobs.  We decide to head out and we go up into the church and<br/>\nthe entire, I think, dungeon runs up on top of us including the named mob<br/>\nXalgoz or something like that.  Well I am the first one to die, and then<br/>\nseven more guildmates die, one person went LD, and 6 more evac out.<br/>\nNeedless to say it wasn&#39;t pretty on the corpse recovery.  Fun was had by all<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went back the next day with no pets, and we had no freaky aggro.  The<br/>\nonly things that aggroed us were intentional.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in conclusion, if you are in the range of levels I stated above, grab<br/>\nyour guild/group/friends and head down there.  Pick up a map though, because<br/>\nyou can&#39;t get out of the dungeon the way you come in.  You go in and out of<br/>\nthe same zone line, but you can&#39;t go up where you drop down from.  Very<br/>\ncryptic, but it makes it that much more dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurik Nitesong<br/>\n40th bard, Veeshan<br/>\n&quot;Only the Brave&quot;<br/>\n___________________<br/>\nRobert Maze<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert@...\">robert@...</a><br/>\nwww.fncinc.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
