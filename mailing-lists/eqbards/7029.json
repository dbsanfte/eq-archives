I&#39;m sure the game was<br/>\ndesigned with typical bell curve plots for damage.  One side of the bell curve<br/>\nbeing extremely &quot;bad rolls&quot; and low damage over the course of a fight, and the<br/>\nother side being one of those fights where you ask your groupmates to scroll<br/>\nback and &quot;look at all that damage I did and how many times my weapon proced!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know from personal experience that being on the low end of that curve<br/>\ngets ya killed or sends you fleeing.  No question.  Everyone has had to flee<br/>\nmany a fight that they should have won due to a run of bad rolls (misses).<br/>\nThis is *less* likely to occur if you stick to the center of the bell curve<br/>\nwith your weapons and choose medium/fast weapons with medium/light damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, everyone knows that when their warrior picks up a Thulian<br/>\nBladed Claw (5dam/19dly) they&#39;re hitting fast and light, with probably<br/>\nunspectacular (average) results.  However, when they pick up a Blackened Iron<br/>\nBastard Sword (BIBS at 20dam/47dly) they&#39;re GAMBLING.  Anyone who has played<br/>\nwith a slow, high damage weapon knows what it&#39;s like to be playing saying<br/>\n&quot;gimmie a hit, gimmie a hit, gimmie a hit&quot;.  The importance of hitting each<br/>\nand every time is greatly increased with slower weapons.  When I play with my<br/>\nClaws, I hardly even notice the misses, and by the time I do I&#39;m having the<br/>\nchance to hit again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 23rd Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
