Now I know now a<br/>\ndays people don&#39;t do this but people always use to bring two full groups<br/>\ninto the room to break it nothing like it is now. Of all the people how<br/>\noften does a bard really melee at that level? A war? Personally I just think<br/>\nthem lee classes should get the first yak and then a bard who  I still can&#39;t<br/>\ndecide what to call it besides bard. They don&#39;t seem like a melee class to<br/>\nme at high leels butrather a support utility.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, January 06, 2000 5:38 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] My Yk!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On Wed, Jan 05/00, &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; that&#39;s how it is in our raids.  our guild has set up a pretty complex but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fair system of lottos as of late, as all we do are planes and dragons.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; of stuff is like this, like mistwalkers are rangers before druids, staff<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; priests before paladins, etc.  we had a vox raid have a paladin win the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; staff and druid win a mistwalker, that was pretty much the last straw for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; lot of people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Isn&#39;t this a bit of a double standard?
