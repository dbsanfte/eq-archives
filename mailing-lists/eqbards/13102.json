I am still a baby bard -<br/>\nstill learning stuff every time - most recently I have learned that my power<br/>\nof estimating is way off!! &quot;Do not under-estimate the might of Mayong<br/>\nMistmoore!&quot; But that is another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I learned a lot about Lady Vox!  A combined effort of some really<br/>\ngood guilds produced a victory - Lady Vox was slain on Innoruuk!  I was<br/>\nlucky enough to be in the crew that cleared the way to the lair.  I saw some<br/>\nreally skilled pullers and some really great giant killers in action.  It<br/>\ntook 90 minutes to clear everything (ice giants, ice giant magis, giant<br/>\nwoolly spiders, ice giant diplomats, icy terrors, & a priest of Nagafen)  to<br/>\nthe dragon.  Then it took over an hour for everyone to reform in to dragon<br/>\nattack groups and buff.  And finally, about 3 minutes to slay the great<br/>\ndragon.  A fabulous effort and some excellent guild cooperation made it<br/>\npossible. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/hail_a_lady_vox.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/hail_a_lady_vox.jpg</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/hail_a_lady_vox.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/hail_a_lady_vox.jpg</a>&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/face_to_face.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/face_to_face.jpg</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/face_to_face.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/face_to_face.jpg</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, my first dragon victory.  I was not killed, I resisted fear, endured<br/>\nthe cold but did go LinkDead in chaos of the final battle of which I saw<br/>\nabout half.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. who is that hatless blueberry in the screenshot? hehe - that&#39;s<br/>\nharmonic!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tMiriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, January 13, 2000 3:43 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: Dragon kit goodies (was:RE: [eqbards] Nagafen 2; Sylly<br/>\n0)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, MR isn&#39;t nearly as important as FR/CR.  With 2 Rhythm<br/>\nspells + Resist Magic, most classes are already at 140-150 MR, at which<br/>\npoint I feel to sacrafice more for MR is at a point of diminishing<br/>\nreturn.  Yes, you&#39;ll get feared about 1 in 3, but getting feared once or<br/>\ntwice a dragon doesn&#39;t really affect the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour FR and CR however, is what will negate the area effect damage spells<br/>\nfrom the dragon.  As a class that cannot bind, you&#39;re only a contributing<br/>\nfactor as long as you stay alive.  Your resist songs is what will keep<br/>\nyou and your tanks long enough for the clerics to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nResist equipment that I always wear:<br/>\n<br/>\nCrown of Froglok Kings\t(+20 CR/FR)<br/>\nSymbols of Loyalty to Vox  (+14 CR)<br/>\nLambent Sleeves and Greaves  (+4 CR/FR/MR)<br/>\nGuise of the Deceiver (+7 MR)<br/>\nDragoon&#39;s Dirk (+2 MR)<br/>\n<br/>\nResist equipment I carry around for dragons:<br/>\n<br/>\nEarrings of Fire Reflection (+10 FR)<br/>\nPlat Peridot Rings (+20 CR)<br/>\nPlat Emerald Rings (+20 FR)<br/>\nGold Emerald Bracers (+14 FR)<br/>\nCloak of the Icebear (+20 CR)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard to get equipment (crown and symbols) are good items in and of<br/>\nthemselves.  The resist equipment I switch in are either Jewelcrafter<br/>\nmade, bought from Gypsies, or in 1 case, easily purchasable off people<br/>\ncamping themselves a GZ.  And really if you prefer lambent bracers to<br/>\nSymbols (I prefer them because I like the band of silver on my wrists),<br/>\nyou can always substitute in Gold Peridot Bracers to save yourselves the<br/>\ncamp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a few more things I can switch around, such as icy greaves and<br/>\nsuch, but my resists are high enough to easily dispatch a dragon.  None of<br/>\nthis stuff is planar, and almost anyone has access to them.  The only<br/>\nother thing you really need is a mm battledrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
