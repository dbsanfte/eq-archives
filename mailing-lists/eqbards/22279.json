Not too bad right? lotsa green.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other stuff includes:<br/>\nlambent bracer<br/>\nlambent legs<br/>\nlambent arms.. add in the blue<br/>\n<br/>\ntree weave<br/>\nmith bp<br/>\nworn cloth mantle<br/>\nguise of deceiver<br/>\nrune bone fork<br/>\ntroll hide belt<br/>\n2 yaks<br/>\nmm drum & nos tamborine<br/>\ngypsie princess lute<br/>\n<br/>\nvarious jewelry<br/>\n<br/>\nWell last night i topped off my ugly look by replacing my lambent bracer for<br/>\na Kylong Wrist guard (same stats but more charisma).  THE BRACER IS BROWNISH<br/>\nRED!!  i freaked out when i saw it, it keeps overwriting my hero bracer<br/>\nlook. I never though i could look worse but oh boy when i put that on did i<br/>\never freak. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile i&#39;m auctioning, some twink bard in full lambent at lev 12 pops up to<br/>\nme asks me what i wanted for my hero bracer (im auctioning it because i have<br/>\na spare)  then after a wee bit says oh nm, i thought you were a twink and<br/>\nnot a real player.  Talk about kicking me while im down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo anyways, that kicked me in the butt severely and now im really<br/>\ndetermined to powerlevel instead of grouping (which i would much rather do).<br/>\nI have to kiss my lambent and tree weave goodbye soon and get some imbrued,<br/>\nim tired of looking like all the twinks with various ss and lambent.  Dont<br/>\nget me wrong, i have nothing against twinking but man im sick of passing for<br/>\nsomething that is 20-30 levels lower then i really am.<br/>\n<br/>\nArg sorry for the rant<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nalmost lev 42 bard<br/>\nThe Menace of Rathe Mountains <br/>\nSol ro<br/>\n<br/>\nI am bard, hear me sing!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
