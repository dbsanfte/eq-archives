Hymn of Restoration now appears to cause a<br/>\nregenerative effect, rather that a heal per pulse effect.  So if you<br/>\nstart the Hymn, then turn the song off, you still heal at the increased<br/>\nrate for the duration of the song effect (while the icon remains on the<br/>\nscreen).  This is not how it behaved early in beta, but it&#39;s good news<br/>\nfor us bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way it seems to work, and it&#39;s understandable how I was confused<br/>\nwhen you see how it works, is that when the first pulse kicks in, your<br/>\nhealth goes up by the appropriate amount (which is something like 3 plus<br/>\none per six levels plus 2 if you&#39;re holding an instrument and plus 2 if<br/>\nyou&#39;re seated).  There are then approximately two more &quot;ticks&quot; where<br/>\nyour health will go up again.  These &quot;ticks&quot; are synchronized with the<br/>\nsong&#39;s pulses, and will occur even if you stop singing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe amount that the &quot;tick&quot; heals is probably determined by<br/>\ninstrument/sitting etc. at the time of the tick, rather than the time of<br/>\nthe original pulse, so standing up after the first tick will probably<br/>\nreduce the amount you are healed on the second and third tick.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t verified this though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
