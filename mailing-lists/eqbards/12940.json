Last night in Mistmoore, we had 8 people<br/>\nL30-44.  3 bards, ranger, 2 pallies, warrior, and enchanter<br/>\n(yeah, no real healer).  Everyone assisted, I did my best to<br/>\nbreak up the spawn and keep the others updated on what to<br/>\nexpect (I was pulling).  They did their best to keep me<br/>\nupdated on their mana status.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monster pull of the night was the first one to break the<br/>\nspawn.  I&#39;d lulled as much as I could but couldn&#39;t guarantee<br/>\nwhat wouldn&#39;t come.  IIRC the pull ended up being the<br/>\nnegotiator, pet, ambassador, shadowy scrivener, pet, another<br/>\ncaster I don&#39;t recall, will pillager, 2 flouting gargs, 1<br/>\nleering garg, 2 deathly ushers, and 1 deathly harbringer.  On<br/>\ntop of that, another scrivener spawned in the room during the<br/>\nfight.  12 vs 8, 14 vs 8 if you count the pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe won, handily.  Both paladins were OOM with 1 LH used, the<br/>\nenchanter was down to about 15%, and I had to switch to a lute<br/>\nto heal in the middle of the fight (6 people wounded * 17<br/>\npoints * 3 pulses healed per application, all but one mob<br/>\nmezed, heck yeah I&#39;m going to heal).  But everyone attacked<br/>\nthe same mob, quickly switched to help out the enchanter when<br/>\nshe was under attack (leaving the mob we had been fighting),<br/>\nand if they weren&#39;t badly wounded pulled stuff that resisted<br/>\nmesmerize off those who were wounded.  Except for the LH,<br/>\nnobody dropped much below 2 bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, it was easy nonstop action and experience.  The<br/>\npace was so fast I made the ranger take over pulling so I<br/>\nwould have enough *time* to loot the corpses and divide the<br/>\nspoils.  Unless you&#39;re killling really easy stuff, if people<br/>\nwon&#39;t listen to you when tell them to /assist, leave the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
