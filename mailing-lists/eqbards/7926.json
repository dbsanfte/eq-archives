We surely do have a diffence of opinion.  10-15 levels with<br/>\nthe same equipment?  Wow if I were twinked like that, I could see why you<br/>\nwould think that the game STARTs at level 20 :)  Thats when you started<br/>\ngetting stuff for yourself :)  Anyway, I really think that if Verant wanted<br/>\nto stop twinking then they would have done something about it, so even<br/>\nthough I think you are very wrong, I cannot change the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIm not going to comment on this anymore:(  I dont think my what i believe is<br/>\nthe majority and I dont want a flame war, over my strong opinion.  Suffice<br/>\nto say, I disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet &lt;Mischief&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel of Bristlebane<br/>\n22nd Human Bard<br/>\non Brell Serelis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Miriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 3:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 5 Oct 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But are you really making their life easier by twinking them?

I know a Druid, who was givin<br/>\nthe<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it depends on the class they&#39;re playing, and the equipment<br/>\nin question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>\nas a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>\nbut there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>\nof them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>\ntrue gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>\ngiving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>\ninto the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>\nreal joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>\nenchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I <br/>\ncan scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>\nwhy I paid to play EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
