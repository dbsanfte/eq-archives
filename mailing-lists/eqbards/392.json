The bard my be the second best soloing class there is. Im 20th<br/>\nlevel now and still soloing. You may be playing the bard like a fighter that<br/>\noccasional sings a song. Wrong. At 9th level go to Ro. Make sure you got a<br/>\nfull suit of leather. Armor is everything in this game. Get out your handy<br/>\nguitar. Now see that scarab on the hill? Go punch it. Drag it back to the<br/>\ngrass area. Wince it twice (with the guitar), then switch to heal for one<br/>\npulse. Repeat. If you get down to 2 bars of health, run around in wide<br/>\ncircle till your health goes back up with the heal song on. And then do it<br/>\nall again.  Make sure you are punching them while singing. I was soloing 3<br/>\nscarabs at a time at 10th level.<br/>\nRemember the bard is not a fighter to hack and slash. You dont have the hp<br/>\nor ac to do it. You kill stuff slow, BUT you can kill more than one at once.<br/>\nNow what other class can claim to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nKolin<br/>\nRelos Zek<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
