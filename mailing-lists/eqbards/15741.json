The point that I was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1886875238\">Don&#39;t disagree with you in the least and given the choice of having an<br/>\nenchanter and not having an enchanter, I&#39;ll always take one :-).  The point<br/>\nthat I was trying to make was that I&#39;ve seen way too many pullers spoiled by<br/>\nenchanters.  Then when the enchanter is AFK or LD or camps for the night the<br/>\nparty dies because the spawns aren&#39;t broken up well enough or the puller is<br/>\njust damn lazy or was never any good to begin with.  Having a good enchanter<br/>\nis not a good excuse for over pulling in my opinion.  A good puller needs to<br/>\nhave a clock on the spawns and know the order that they pulled them in.<br/>\nThey need to know EXACTLY when to go to a certain spot to pick up the next<br/>\nspawn.  A really good puller even knows when and where to pick up the<br/>\nroamers.  A really good puller has the next single MOB incoming just as the<br/>\nparty finishes off the current one.  A really good puller frees up the<br/>\nenchanter to help in a ton of different ways other then mezzing a crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I love to have the parachute there though for when<br/>\nthings do go bad, but I would much prefer not to have to pull the rip cord.<br/>\nEspecially since only about 30% of the parties I&#39;m in have an enchanter at<br/>\nall.  I don&#39;t know about the other servers, but there is definately a lack<br/>\nof good enchanters on Prexus.<br/>\n<br/>\nTan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2000 9:02 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Breaking from conventional tactics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeff,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are many times when you are going to have to fight multiple mobs.<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; not because a &quot;pull&quot; is screwed up but because it is the way things are<br/>\n&gt; going to pull.  In this case, crowd control falls to the class that is<br/>\nbest<br/>\n&gt; able to deal with it: enchanter(s).  When my guild goes on a raid to a<br/>\n&gt; serious place (fire giants, ice giants, dragons, planes) we have 2<br/>\n&gt; enchanters.  I can&#39;t tell you exactly which mez spell they use on which<br/>\nmob,<br/>\n&gt; many times they charm (can&#39;t mez giants?) but whatever they do, one of<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; best specialties is crowd control.  In some situations, other guilds use<br/>\n&gt; other tactics (2 clerics per tank group & level 50 tanks) and just beat<br/>\ndown<br/>\n&gt; what they can and res back until they have cleared what they want.  We<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; our enchanters to do crowd control (we like Clarity & Swift Like The Wind<br/>\n&gt; too ;p)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For some fun we decided to jump into the pit under Vox&#39;s Lair and clear<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; the giant polar bears, wooly spider, & dire wolves.  If you fall down the<br/>\n&gt; first pitfall, you land in a room with 5 or 6 giant polar bears (blue to<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; at 48).  They are positioned such that if you pull one you will get<br/>\nseveral.<br/>\n&gt; We had 3 groups, 2 enchanters and no problems dealing with them.  Too bad<br/>\n&gt; Verant forgot to itemize them with any loot.  It was fun jumping into some<br/>\n&gt; place that you usually try so hard to avoid and then cleaning house.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But in other situations, you are going to face multi-mob pulls.  Plane of<br/>\n&gt; Hate getting a couple Clerics, Scron Banshee and Forsaken Rev in one pull<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; fairly normal and with enchanters&#39; crowd control, your teams can deal with<br/>\n&gt; it.  We go for everyone kill the same mob and fite them one at a time.  We<br/>\n&gt; have designated taunters in the event a pet or something breaks and gets<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; a cleric or enchanter but the main group assists the primary and secondary<br/>\n&gt; target pickers.  (Make hotkeys that say &quot;/assist name1&quot;  and &quot;/assist<br/>\nname2&quot;<br/>\n&gt; rather than just &quot;/assist&quot;).  Even so, we see that the assist command is<br/>\n&gt; buggy and sometimes you cant get a target or get a bad target but the<br/>\nintent<br/>\n&gt; is to focus on one mob at a time.  It something that we have worked out<br/>\n&gt; given how we load groups (one cleric per tank group).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the biggest value of having a SOP (Standard Operating Plan) is<br/>\n&gt; maintaining a coordinated effort.  If everyone has a job and sticks to it,<br/>\n&gt; you eliminate the confusion that can rapidly escalate into disaster when<br/>\n&gt; somebody gets creative and &#39;trys something&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly SongSynger<br/>\n&gt; Bardette of 48 songs<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Illian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, March 04, 2000 12:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Breaking from conventional tactics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Admitted, but the point was an Enchanter who is mezzing is doing so<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the party screwed up in the first place IMHO...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Perhaps a Princess...
