My group was in<br/>\npretty good shape - we were all at 4+ bubbles with him down to<br/>\n&#39;Mae&#39; and both clerics having almost half their mana.  But<br/>\nthen he started ping-ponging, our damage rate dropped to<br/>\nalmost zero, and he was gaining hp as we died.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem was that because he was quad-attacking, after<br/>\nhe was ping-ponged, the first tank to get to him usually ended<br/>\nup eating 4-8 attacks in quick succession.
