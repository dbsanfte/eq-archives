When I gave the<br/>\n&gt; quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate, faction change<br/>\n&gt; messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on the next line in<br/>\n&gt; the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting<br/>\n&gt; something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key word/phrase.  I<br/>\n&gt; tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot; but got no further<br/>\n&gt; response from her.  Was wondering if this was just a bug or if there might<br/>\n&gt; possibly something else I could have given her?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 30 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to: <br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
