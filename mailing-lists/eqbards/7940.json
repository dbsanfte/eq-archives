In groups though, I still wonder about my song<br/>\nselections some time.  Soloing I use warsong, bellow, bellow, because I&#39;m<br/>\nfighting white or yellow con&#39;sing monsters and I need the extra damage<br/>\nfrom bellow to win the damage race.  In a group of two, I actually sing<br/>\nanthem, warsong, bellow, since I am probably better equipped then my<br/>\ngroupmate and it would be better for me to tank, so I try and pull it on<br/>\nmyself.  In larger groups I sing anthem, healing, bellow, and I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s pretty much the standard right?  Obviously I drop the last song if<br/>\nthe lag gets too high, which is almost always bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Winderyder<br/>\nLvl 50 Cleric<br/>\nLvl 15 Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
