She also dropped a Book used in the Fiery<br/>\nAvenger quest which we gave to Avarus of the Legions of Darkness (a rival<br/>\nquild).  He should be the first on our server to complete the quest and<br/>\nobtain the coveted weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fight seemed much longer than our battle with Nagafen but I have not<br/>\nchecked my log yet to see the actual time.  I was again in the 2nd wave.<br/>\nThis time there were *alot* of casualties and until the very end I was<br/>\nuncertain of the outcome.  She has that ridiculous complete heal but I did<br/>\nnot see her use it - maybe she did early on and went OOM.  I managed to live<br/>\nthrough the battle - perhaps because I did not melee until the very end.<br/>\nElemental & Guardian with MM Batle drum.  No one in our party ran from the<br/>\nfear and we were directly underneath her.  And, oh yeah, there are a couple<br/>\nsurprizes waiting for you.  Far be it from me to spoil your fun but when you<br/>\nget there I think you will notice a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogging in was almost harder than killing the dragon.  For some reason, the<br/>\npatch server would error out downloading the updates over my ISDN<br/>\nconnection.  In despairation, I connected my 2nd PC with a crap 28.8 analog<br/>\nto my backup ISP and was able to get the updates. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:32:48 2000]  (first groups go in)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:35 2000] You feel an aura of mystic protection surround<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:35 2000] Lady Vox was pierced by thorns.<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:35 2000] Lady Vox begins to cast a spell.<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:35 2000] Murdok feels much better.<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:35 2000] You resist the Dragon Roar spell!!<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:36:36 2000] Lady Vox was pierced by thorns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/voxxie/ladyvox_00.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/voxxie/ladyvox_00.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Tue Mar 21 20:37:59 2000] Lady Vox has been slain by Shadownastee!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/voxxie/deadvox_00.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/voxxie/deadvox_00.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
