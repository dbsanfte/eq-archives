What is the equation to figure<br/>\n&gt; out whether to use Psalm or Chains assuming 0% resist on the Chains?  I<br/>\n&gt; think I did this at one point but can&#39;t find it now and recall it was<br/>\nrather<br/>\n&gt; complicated but came out to a simple result for log parser plug-ins once<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; solved all the equations.  ie at 5hp per hit what average damage per<br/>\n&gt; hit/hits per second ratio would suggest that Psalm would be more effective<br/>\n&gt; than Chains.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm vs. Bellow was a straight damage to damage comparison.  <br/>\nChain doesn&#39;t do damage, rather it increases your survival<br/>\nduration, giving you more time to do damage via other means.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm does dps damage per hit.<br/>\nYou do Dp damage per &quot;round&quot; (excluding Psalm).<br/>\nYou have H hp.<br/>\n<br/>\nMob hits N times per &quot;round&quot; (unchained).<br/>\nMob does d damage per hit.<br/>\nHence mob does Dm = N*d damage per &quot;round&quot; (unchained).<br/>\nChain increases time between hits by 30% (i.e. drops Dm by 30%).<br/>\nMob has M hp.  (H/M is the important figure)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Psalm, your survival time is (H/Dm) rounds.<br/>\nWith Chain, your survival time is (1.3*H/Dm) rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Psalm, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/(Dp + N*dps) rounds.<br/>\nWith Chain, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/Dp rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe better song will have a better ratio of your survival time<br/>\nto the mob&#39;s survival time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm:  (H/Dm) / [M/(Dp+Dps)]  = (H/M) * (Dp+N*dps)/Dm<br/>\nChain:  (1.3*H/Dm) / (M/Dp)    = (H/M) * (1.3*Dp)/Dm<br/>\n<br/>\nDrop the common factors to get:<br/>\n<br/>\nDp+N*dps &gt; 1.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich simplifies to:<br/>\n<br/>\nN*dps &gt; 0.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>\n<br/>\nN = number of times a mob hits you per &quot;round&quot;<br/>\ndps = damage of Psalm per hit<br/>\nDp = your average damage per &quot;round&quot;<br/>\nAssuming Chain is never resisted<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t double-checked the math in this, as I&#39;m pretty busy<br/>\ncoding.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
