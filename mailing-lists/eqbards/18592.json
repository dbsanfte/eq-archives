I was in a group at the time so didn&#39;t get to try out the<br/>\nFear/Chains tricks that evening.  However we got hit by a huge train by an<br/>\nogre running out of the goblin mines and everyone was sure we were going to<br/>\ndie.  The Zone call was made, so I strummed up Screech and crossed my<br/>\nfingers.  Every single goblin fled.  The party seeing this decided to try<br/>\nand pick them off as they came back.  With our druid and ranger snaring them<br/>\nand me playing Denon&#39;s, Hymn, and Screech, we were able to kill off a 14<br/>\ngoblin train 2 at a time.  It was glorious!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday nite I got a chance to try it out soloing while I waited for other<br/>\nguild members to show up.  All the tricks I was given worked excellently!<br/>\nKudos to all those who gave pointers.  Using Chains and Screech was<br/>\nridiculously effective.  If I accidentally got extra mobs it never mattered,<br/>\nthey just ran away every time I feared and along the same path as the mob I<br/>\nwas Chaining, so it was like keeping a steady stream of victims &#39;on the<br/>\nleash&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was emboldened by my success and decided to try a different theme on the<br/>\nwhole Screech tactic.  An all instrument Screech version.  Try this if you<br/>\ndare!  I ran into the middle of the haunted tower in the Lake of Ill Omen,<br/>\nyou know the one with the Icebone, Charbone, and Warbone skeletons.  I then<br/>\nfired up Denon&#39;s with my horn nailing all five skeletons (All blue to me).<br/>\nI then twisted in Fear and Hymn switching to Mandolin for Hymn.  From the<br/>\ncomments of the 5 or 6 passerby it must have been quite hilarious.  The<br/>\nScreech would send the skeletons (mostly DoT&#39;d) running from the tower.  I<br/>\nwould heal with Hymn.  They would run back in, get a dose of Denon&#39;s, a<br/>\nquick Screech, and then run back out.  After several minutes of this they<br/>\nall lay dead around me and I never lost more than a bubble of health to<br/>\nresisters or when pulsing Denon&#39;s.  I still can&#39;t believe I was able to solo<br/>\n5 blues that in melee would each do 3-4 bubs to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say the tactics were a huge success, thanks all again!  I&#39;m very<br/>\nglad I was in an optimistic mood on Friday and downloaded the Solon&#39;s tricks<br/>\nfrom Rokenn&#39;s Song Analysis site.  I made 27th on Saturday nite and by<br/>\nSunday evening I had practiced on newbie mobs and was happily soloing duos<br/>\nand trios of white/blues using Sirens.  I can&#39;t wait to get back to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a couple of important things about Siren&#39;s in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>\nDo not try to charm the renegade Iksar.  I could not even charm Iksar<br/>\nbandits (probably about 15 levels below me).  I got 10 resists in a row on<br/>\nan Iksar bandit and gave up.  I had previously tried an Iksar brigand and<br/>\ngotten 10 resists in a row on that mob as well.  Sabertooths seem quite<br/>\nsusceptible to charm.  A sabertooth grimalkin is quite capable of killing 3<br/>\nblues before you need a new pet and seldom resisted my Sirens attempts even<br/>\nwith battle gear on (93 cha).  Warbones skels, although easier to melee solo<br/>\nthan Iksar Exiles, can strangely beat those same Exiles when used as a pet.<br/>\nMy blue Sabertooth Grimalkin pet was even able to beat a white/black Iksar<br/>\nExile and only lost about half its health.  Those Grimalkins hit hard!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the suggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
