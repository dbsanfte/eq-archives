I remember when I first fought Dorn (don&#39;t remember my level),<br/>\nhe was a &quot;blue risky&quot; to me.  I had a magician, same level as I, and her<br/>\npet with me.  Usually, in a situation like that, I&#39;d lose about 2<br/>\nbubbles of health, and that&#39;s it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe camped him for a while.  In 5 fights, he knocked me out twice<br/>\n(without killing me), and did the same to the magician once.  He killed<br/>\n3 pets.  I never ended a fight with more than a bubble.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
