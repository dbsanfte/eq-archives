As someone pointed out - it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2136729551\">One thing to keep in mind with asking for changes; anything that<br/>\nrequires major programming changes just isn&#39;t going to happen.  As someone<br/>\npointed out - it would be nice to have more than 8 song slots; but even if<br/>\nVerant decided it wouldn&#39;t un-balance the game (or whatever reasons they<br/>\nmight be opposed to it from a design perspective) - they would have to<br/>\ntotally revamp the interface and make other programming changes to<br/>\naccomplish it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Similar - when requesting other changes - we have to try to imagine the<br/>\namount of effort it would take on Verant&#39;s behalf to implement it.  Anything<br/>\nthat is going to take a lot of programming resources just won&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n    For that reason I fear that the &quot;Identify in Trade Window for No<br/>\nTrade/No Drop&quot; won&#39;t happen.  To accomplish this - they have to move the<br/>\ncheck from when you move it to the window to when you click ok.  This well<br/>\nmay be a HUGE programming change (maybe not - we can&#39;t tell since we don&#39;t<br/>\nhave access to the code).   So some of the things people want to see just<br/>\nwon&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I fear that this may be the case for binding by NPC&#39;s.  When JM posted<br/>\nhe pointed out that the binding issue was a huge philosophical/design<br/>\nargument by the designers at Verant (we don&#39;t know how accurate his sources<br/>\nare - but it rang true).  From what he said - we&#39;re never going to get the<br/>\nability to bind ourselves - and probably also won&#39;t be ever be able to be<br/>\nbound anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The NPC binding though seems from the design perspective to be<br/>\nconsistent the limitation the designers seemed to want to employ.  My<br/>\nconcern is that it could be a major programming effort - since as far as<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen there is nothing equivalent to it within the design.  The closest<br/>\nwould be to sell an item (scroll?) that cast the same spell.  This might<br/>\nstray from their design philosophy...<br/>\n<br/>\n    So perhaps we should ask them to create a scroll or potion or some other<br/>\nitem with one charge that casts the same spell that people cast when they<br/>\nbind us (i.e. it will fail if cast in a non-city zone)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde - 23 - of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
