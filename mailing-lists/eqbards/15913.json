The game says the<br/>\nitem is lore, it doesn&#39;t go into your inventory, and it<br/>\ndisappears from view on the corpse.  If you stand up and loot<br/>\nagain, it&#39;s back.  As you found out, it also happens with<br/>\nstuff in your inventory, though I haven&#39;t managed to duplicate<br/>\nthat reliably.  Zoning or camping makes it reappear.  And it<br/>\nalso happens with coin if you use the /split command too soon<br/>\nafter another split.  It says you must wait, and if you don&#39;t<br/>\nget disconnected, the money you tried to split disappears from<br/>\nyour inventory but isn&#39;t split.  Once you zone, it&#39;s restored<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
