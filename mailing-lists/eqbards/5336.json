A<br/>\nbloodstained tunic will run you about 200pp (all these<br/>\nclerics, paladins, shamen, and rangers trying to get one<br/>\ndrives up the price) which is a lot of wisps at L11.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt L11, I&#39;d suggest a Lockjaw hide vest or banded coat (banded<br/>\nhas better AC but is heavier).  Those should be about 25pp<br/>\neach.  Chest and head/shoulder armor tends to have the best<br/>\nAC/weight ratio so it&#39;s best to exploit that slight advantage.  <br/>\nI&#39;d add a thick leather apron (1 more AC than plate, weighs<br/>\nonly 1 lb, around 25-50pp), snakeskin mask and gloves (leather<br/>\nAC but lighter and adds +dex and +MR modifiers, 5pp each).  I<br/>\ncurrently use the apron and plan to skip buying a plate girth.<br/>\nThe mask and gloves served me all the way up to L27, when I<br/>\nfinally switched to a plate mask (double the AC/weight ratio<br/>\nof other plate pieces) and elfhide gloves.  You will also<br/>\nprobably want a bloodstained mantle since IIRC it is basically<br/>\nchain, but +3 to str and +10 to MR.  Cost should be 30-70pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of these items may be difficult to obtain or afford at<br/>\nL11, but if you get them, I promise you will be using them for<br/>\na long long time.  (The vest is probably the shortest-lived, <br/>\nbut you can give it to a monk friend and make him very very<br/>\nhappy. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
