Verant is a poorly run company.  Their in house<br/>\ntesting is abysmal (if it exists at all, which I have serious doubts of).<br/>\nTheir customer service is embarassing, and their arrogance is the stuff of<br/>\nkings.  They just wrote a really good game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, they treat everyone like that.  Perhaps theres a few more<br/>\nbard problems since we are the most unusual class in the game.  (This goes<br/>\nback to their lack of testing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you expect things to change this time?<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a viable competitor arrives, this attitude won&#39;t hurt them.  If<br/>\nAnarchy Online (which I doubt will be, as its a sci fi setting, which has<br/>\nalways been a smaller market than fantasy.) is this viable competitor then<br/>\nsoon we will see them reaping what they have sown.  If not we will have to<br/>\nwait for horizons/shadowbane/whatever.  (All of which are a long way away).<br/>\n<br/>\nRecent posts from Brad indicate to me, they believe the game has reached its<br/>\npeak and are preparing for the inevitable shrinking of the population.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
