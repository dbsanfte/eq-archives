Swam to an island, took a boat to the<br/>\nevil outpost and then the fun began.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot to see several places in Kunark and the graphics are amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to my question..<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions on where to hunt? Fironia Vie seemed to have a lot of black, yellow and red that could<br/>\nbe charm fought. Or the Swamp of No hope and Warsilik Woods looked ok as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know frontier Mt.&#39;s is an option but that requires a group I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions will be much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanien Aeleroth<br/>\nBard of the 27th song</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
