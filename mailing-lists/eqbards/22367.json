Let&#39;s<br/>\nthink about the level 49 song and fighting in lower guk.  Say you get 4<br/>\nfrogs and 2 of the 4 are casters. Your enchanter mezzes 3 of them and the<br/>\nrest of the group attacks the melee class frog first.  If the fight lasts 30<br/>\nseconds, that means 10 chances to drain say 200 mana.  So, you might get<br/>\n2/3rd&#39;s of the next target&#39;s mana - maybe only half since NPC&#39;s seem to have<br/>\nso damn much mana.  But after another 30 second fight - not only would you<br/>\ncontinue to deplete the mana of the mezzed one but also the one being<br/>\nkilled.  So it&#39;s strength would be in multiple mob pulls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno - it&#39;s hard to imagine that it could be so strong as to make it a<br/>\nreally useful thing.  My gut feeling is that they don&#39;t really test it<br/>\nhands-on.  Ie: do you think that Ester, GZ, and Absor go to Lguk on test,<br/>\nshout for a group and try these things?  Or does GZ who knows the exact mana<br/>\npool of mobs, kinda make an educated guess and &quot;balance&quot; the song so that in<br/>\ntheory &quot;on a good day&quot; - it might get like half the mana from a mob (that<br/>\nnormally dies before he can burn much mana anyhow - except GZ doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nknow how fast mobs die.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be funny to depelete all the mobs mana and have your enchanter yell<br/>\nat you because he cant cast Theft of Thought on that mezzed Bok Shaman =)<br/>\n&quot;Your target has no mana left to effect!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nMinstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.
