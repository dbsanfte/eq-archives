This way they are<br/>\nhappy, and us the unknowing are not getting as much benefit as we thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>\narise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>\nlevel the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>\naverage monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>\nit, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>\nattack rate, so therefore they do more damage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think twisting is worth it.  The closest I come is while<br/>\nbellowing, as soon as I see the damage message, I stop and restart the song.<br/>\nThis decreases the times between bellows almost in half.  I actually felt<br/>\nguilty about this at first, but without doing this, I would have problems<br/>\nfighting some of the black/white creatures that I tend to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this against you in any<br/>\nways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was designed to do<br/>\nthis?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs don&#39;t stop<br/>\nimmediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that you can restart<br/>\nthe song without losing the effect of whichever song you were playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my 2cp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar 17th level bard of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, July 12, 1999 3:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Max damage?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Treilanin said:<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Now my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while <br/>\n&gt; you are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed <br/>\n&gt; the difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one <br/>\n&gt; song during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed <br/>\n&gt; just as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something <br/>\n&gt; that I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days. <br/>\n&gt; If I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so. <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing <br/>\n&gt; things.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of <br/>\n&gt;      ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that he<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>\n&gt;      If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole<br/>\n&gt; methodology <br/>\n&gt;      behind running a bard character.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      Bujold 17th (finally) <br/>\n&gt;      Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
