I<br/>\n&gt;think I need to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Ranian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ranian,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am just catching up with the many emails of late.  Downtime macro I use:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/pause 30, /cast 3<br/>\n&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/cast 4<br/>\n&gt;/e sings a soothing tune<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I always stopsong at the beginning of my macro since most time I already<br/>\n&gt;have a song up that needs stopping.  My pause 5 is time I need to recover<br/>\n&gt;consistently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cast 3 is either Cantana or HOR depending on group makeup(Cantana for<br/>\n&gt;heavier caster group and HOR for heavier melee).  My pause 30 is for my<br/>\n&gt;timing of casting time for buff icon to come up before next song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Stopsong again and pause to recover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cast 4 is Chorus of Clarity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My emote is just let everyone I group with know what I am doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I leave Clarity song going for two pulses and hit the macro again.  If I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t pay attention or go afk for a sec, clarity continues to play = happy<br/>\n&gt;casters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In general, I use three macros during combat.  Based on my own experience<br/>\n&gt;and knowledge gained from this list, they are only 2 line macros.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Each combat macro uses this base structure:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/pause 5, /stopsong<br/>\n&gt;/cast x  (where x is the number of the song you want to cast).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I label them Fight 1, Fight 2 and Fight 3.  If I need a different song, I<br/>\n&gt;either edit the macro to a different song already memmed or mem in the<br/>\n&gt;right<br/>\n&gt;song.  What does this do for you?  I only have to hit three keys to twist<br/>\n&gt;instead of six(don&#39;t have to stop a song anymore).  I only use 2 line<br/>\n&gt;macros<br/>\n&gt;in case there is a problem and I need to do something else.  Macros can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;stopped(that I know of) so long macros can cause a problem.  (ie, you just<br/>\n&gt;started a long macro, then big bad mob spawns on cleric, you want to charm<br/>\n&gt;it, but ack! you can&#39;t due to the macro must run its course... you can see<br/>\n&gt;the potential problem)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Piemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n&gt;Bard of 39 Songs<br/>\n&gt;The Nameless<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
