It is the equivalent<br/>\nof the spell Lull, but in song form.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real purpose of the song is &quot;camp busting&quot;.  Say you have a camp of<br/>\nthree blue orcs, all standing around the fire.  You could kill one easily,<br/>\nbut three would kick your behind.  No problem.  Target an orc, sing your<br/>\nsong.  The orc looks sad.  Stop the song, target another orc, sing your<br/>\nsong.  The orc looks sad.  Target the third orc, the one with the nice<br/>\nweapon, now shoot a Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow at it.  The beweaponed orc<br/>\ncharges toward you, while the other two contemplate their navels and quietly<br/>\nweep.<br/>\n<br/>\nRepeat as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing though, this song seems to have been decreased in power recently.<br/>\nI notice that although creatures seem sad, they seem not to be lulled as<br/>\nreliably anymore.  Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
