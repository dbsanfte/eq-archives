At best that 30 seconds will not gain you 400+<br/>\ndamage.  If you were using your chants during that 30 seconds, and counting<br/>\nthe best scenario where you lose 2 pulses of Frost, 3 pulses of Flame, and 4<br/>\npulses of Fulfill&#39;s you lose 350 damage from chants to gain 400 pts from<br/>\nDDD.  Since you really lose the full 5 pulses of each Chant, some on the<br/>\nback side while you restart them, you actually lose 600+ pts of damage in 30<br/>\nseconds.  These numbers are just with a store bought drum.  If you have even<br/>\na Nostrolo&#39;s tambourine you lose even more potential damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking that into account DDD is worse than useless if you have to mem it<br/>\nevery time you want to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
