There&#39;s really not a whole <br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot I can do if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;my tanking is sub par and I can&#39;t use any songs that might <br/>\n&gt; &gt; awaken his mezzed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;mobs.  So long as I can find a group that doesn&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanters in it I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;can do very well.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to find a group <br/>\n&gt; &gt; without one and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that&#39;s when the suggestions begin.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well i was hoping that he would list his level so i could just post a song list<br/>\nthat would be very enchanter friendly and pretty effective, but he seems to<br/>\nhave ignored it, so maybe i just run through all the levels starting with 20 or<br/>\nso.  i&#39;m assuming a twist of 3 songs and average weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nso at 20, let&#39;s see.  how about anthem, hymn of restoration, and bellow for melee fights,<br/>\nanthem, hymn, guardian rhythms vs casters?  if you&#39;re fighting nonstop with tanks using<br/>\n2 hand weapons, you might want to load jig, along with selos, lament if you&#39;re breaking a<br/>\ncamp, invis for avoiding trains, etc.  so that would be anthem, hymn, bellow, guardian, selos,<br/>\njig, lament, invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 23, you can swap chains in and play anthem, hymn, chains for melee and anthem, hymn,<br/>\nguardian for casters, but switch to chains at about half health to prevent runners.  so now song<br/>\nlist would look like anthem, hymn, bellow, guardian, chains,  3 of selos/jig/lament/invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 25 you get psalm of warmth, a damage shield that stacks with every other damage shield.<br/>\nat this point, if your enchanter has enough mana, you could let him haste the tanks and go<br/>\nwith hymn, chains, psalm, or you could still do the haste and start with anthem/psalm/chains<br/>\nand swap in hymn later or, well, there are lots of options now.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 26 you get fear, which is useful for getting a head start when getting out of sticky situations.<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t really apply to this discussion, but i mention it because it will take up a song slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 27 you get charm, which means you can now back up the enchanter with crowd control.  on<br/>\npulls of 2 the enchanter can just debuff while you charm.  on pulls of 3, he can use the single mez<br/>\ninstead of ae mez.  this also can help pull a mob off him when it frenzies on him after it breaks<br/>\neither charm or mez.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 28 you get pixie strike.  also useful for short term mezzing a mob after it breaks whatever the enchanter<br/>\ncast on it to give him a chance to recast a mez or charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nat 32 is clarity, stacks with enchanter clarity, takes up another song slot.<br/>\n<br/>\n36 gives you another speed song, altho the enchanter is probably taking care of that now.<br/>\n<br/>\n38 gives you your second targetted dot.  now if you want, throw the drum in and you can twist bellow, fufil&#39;s<br/>\nchant, and chant of flame.<br/>\n<br/>\n39, second charm song, just as useful as the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\n40, you can start debuffing damage shields and shield skins that some higher level wizards cast on themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n46, third targetted dot song.  now you can really lay the smack down on those mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n47, nivs, this is pretty cool.  usually in my groups i will sing the 50 combat buff, hymn and nivs with a lute.  we<br/>\ntake almost no damage.  5 of us killed a bok and ended the fight at full health without the cleric ever having to<br/>\ncast a heal.  this has the added side effect of allowing the enchanter to heal up between mez breaks without having<br/>\nthe cleric cast heals on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nso all these songs are great with an enchanter, and help the group immensely.  the great thing about the<br/>\nbard is that they can do so many different things depending on the composition of the group.  an enchanter<br/>\nis just another group member to complement.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
