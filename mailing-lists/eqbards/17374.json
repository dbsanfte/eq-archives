Did you try logging out and back<br/>\ninto the game?  If you were in a duel that will sometimes cause your client<br/>\nto act oddly.  Sometimes being charmed or feared will do it too.  Basically<br/>\nthe client thinks you&#39;re an NPC (or gets messed up in other ways.  Kinda<br/>\nlike the group bugs we hit from time to time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, try logging out and back in if that happens.  That SHOULD fix<br/>\nit (all the way to windows, not just to char select).<br/>\n<br/>\nCIAO!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKev<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 05, 2000 12:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Guild question (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We tried both.
