That&#39;s great of you, but thanks to guildies, I&#39;m all blue except for 1<br/>\nbracer!  I *really* appreciate that offer!  Equipment wise, I think I&#39;m<br/>\ngolden (even instruments...I have MM drums and Lute of Gypsy Princess),<br/>\nalthough offhand, I can&#39;t even think of what I have in the equip slots that<br/>\ndon&#39;t have lambent pieces for them...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that note, is there anything better than lambent for us?  I know there<br/>\nare singing steel boots (or I think I know...heh), that are supposed to be<br/>\nbetter.  Is there a whole singing steel suit?  Dunno...I kinda like being<br/>\nall blue!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 12, 2001 9:52 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Input on Recent digest Topics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy worst leveling period was 34 to 36 for some odd reason. My cleric mate<br/>\nand I set death records and lost level records til some higher level friends<br/>\nof ours set us down in Garton&#39;s tower in MM and force feed us exp til we got<br/>\nout of that range. We all started going to Kedge Keep about then too, no one<br/>\nwas there so it was really cool to have bascially your own private dungeon.<br/>\nSpent from the high 30s to 50 in KK. I believe strongly this was the dungeon<br/>\nV has alluded to as having the best exp modifier in the game. It better, the<br/>\nloot completely sucks: just fish aned scales. Rare drops are exactly that in<br/>\nKK. I do have the sharkskin drum and maybe my luck is bad but we pulled that<br/>\nspawn routinely for most of the levels we spent in KK and we didn&#39;t get it<br/>\ntil things were starting to go green to us there. <br/>\nThe brakes really kick in on leveling above 50. It really goes slow. Right<br/>\nnow, we going to Howling Stones when we can find folks to go. That seems to<br/>\nmove the exp bar better than anything else we&#39;ve tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby I have used on the last 2 years mainly to crowd control extremely<br/>\ngreen stuff. I should put the screenshot I have of me and about 20 froggies<br/>\nin Upper Guk somewhere. I think our dispell song is completely random about<br/>\nwhich buff it takes off and thus I never use it. Clerics get upset if you<br/>\nstrip off your symbol accidently. Twilight is a great song! I use the &#39;come<br/>\nhither&#39; part of it as much as I use the mez portion!<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal, I&#39;ll give you an armor quest! You catch big Bril in a zone with a<br/>\nbank and I&#39;ll give you the 3 or 4 pieces of lambent I have in the bank, if<br/>\nyou want them. I think I have arms, legs, boots, and a bracer at least. It&#39;s<br/>\njust taking up space and I don&#39;t know anyone in my circle of friends nutty<br/>\nenough to start a bard anyway. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
