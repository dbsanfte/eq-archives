My suggestion: avoid Freeport until you think you can survive it. :)  After getting a little tired of Fennin, I started a bard on Zek last week, and so far I&#39;ve had a great time.  I started in Kelethin, and aside from a few evil gnome and halfling pkers (Hello Yoink, Xoink and Verminnard!), things are pretty peaceful.  And, the few times I&#39;ve been attacked, the stupid<br/>\ncasters always open up with root, giving me ample time to get selos started and hightail it out of there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLohengrin<br/>\n    -22nd level bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n    -8th level bard on Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
