When we went in there was one lower<br/>\nlevel druid soloing the skeletons (to let you know how blue they were)<br/>\nWe grouped with him and helped him have less downtime. OTOH,<br/>\nthere are more Iskar in that level range now. That was within a week/<br/>\nweek and a half of Kunark coming out. Kurn&#39;s Tower (at least the<br/>\nskeleton portion) would, IMHO, be good for a group of around lvl 15.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a little higher, go down to the badgers. They are an interesting<br/>\nchallenge<br/>\nand at least have the potential of going higher in level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWArning: the badgers do have a lifetap that seems impossible to stun.<br/>\nYou&#39;re going to need a enchanter or someone to remove them from<br/>\nbattle entirely (other than the one you are fighting)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe druid we grouped with said there IS a named skeleton that spawns in the<br/>\nthrone<br/>\nroom Not named in the classical sense. But in that he was a rarer spawn that<br/>\noccasionally dropped a nice (tunic? I think) item. There are also some named<br/>\nthat<br/>\ndrop quest loot of some sort. (This mostly useful for Iskar though, as the<br/>\nquests are mostly Iskar, as I&#39;m finding out in my Warrior) In another<br/>\nfew levels I&#39;ll be taking Jidranth over to Kurn&#39;s Tower and seeing what he<br/>\nthinks of the place  at a more level appropriate time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kimes, Dean W.

One of our lower levels is a druid so he will<br/>\n&gt;probably be interested as he&#39;s wearing leather right now I think.  Most of<br/>\n&gt;the people who might be interested aren&#39;t really twinked, but they might<br/>\n&gt;have an item or two from higher level guildmembers.  If we do it I&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt;more of a bopdyguard and observer than actually looking for loot myself<br/>\n&gt;other than a recipe for that darned cake.
