That is how<br/>\n&gt; your friend could tell, I believe.  Having not found<br/>\n&gt; that stupid sand giant, I can&#39;t verify as of yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, not really.  I just know when I see him he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blue instead of white or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yellow.  However, I zoned into SRo the other day and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saw a blue SG.  A 33rd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DE Necro girlfriend was with me and I said &quot;Hey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there he is!  Let&#39;s toast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him!&quot; and she said &quot;That&#39;s not him.&quot;  How she knew I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know because he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was blue to her too.  I&#39;ll ask her tonight if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remember to.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Crier Sharpsong </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
