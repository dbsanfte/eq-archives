IIRC, after a battle, Roop was poisoned and knocked unconscious<br/>\nwhile at the same time singing the Hymn.  He kept alternating between<br/>\nbetween unconscious and conscious as the poison and Hymn kept battling it<br/>\nout.  For Roop, the Hymn eventually won out.  Here is what happened to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group was fighting orcs in the Oasis near the zone border to North Ro.<br/>\nWe were generally fighting two at a time but the guy who was pulling<br/>\naccidently pulled five at one time.  During the course of the fight, things<br/>\nstarted turning sour so I started singing the Hymm of Restoration.  At that<br/>\npoint, a couple of orcs began to team up on me.  The group leader yelled for<br/>\neveryone to zone.  I was down to one bar of health.  As I was backing up to<br/>\nthe zone border, I got whacked hard and was knocked unconscious.  A split<br/>\nsecond later, the Hymn pulse kicked in and I regained consciousness.<br/>\nApparently the last hit from the orc just barely knocked me to unconscious,<br/>\nand the Hymm pulse raised me to just above 0 health.  I was pressing the<br/>\nDown arrow key the whole time so when I regained consciousness, fortunately<br/>\nfor me, I zoned into North Ro and survived.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter saying thanks to Bristlebain, I wondered if this was a bug (shouldn&#39;t<br/>\ncontinue to get song effects if bard is unconscious) or just another benefit<br/>\nto the natural effects of all bard songs, (i.e. they continue to produce<br/>\neffects even when the bard is no longer singing them).  Should I /bug this<br/>\nor just be thankful that I didn&#39;t die.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
