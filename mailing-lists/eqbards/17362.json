Our severely<br/>\noverpowered group consisted of 2 bards (35), 1 rogue (35), 1 warrior (35), 1<br/>\ndruid (35) and 1 shaman (33). During the night we were fortunate to see the<br/>\nButler once, and he actually had the fang for us. I didn&#39;t win the lotto. :┬¼<br/>\n(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, our rogue said that he needed the EBW too. I was wondering what all<br/>\nof your opinions on the matter were. I would love some ammo for my side of<br/>\nthe argument that there are other things he should be going after. Of<br/>\ncourse, if I&#39;m wrong, then I guess that means I&#39;ll be in MM a looooooong<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n*does some quick math, 4 x 4 = 16.*<br/>\n<br/>\nEep, we need 8 fangs as a group?<br/>\n<br/>\n*runs off to cry*<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!  <br/>\n1.
