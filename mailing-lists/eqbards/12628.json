I assume people were upset<br/>\n&gt; because a ranger is better at melee and thus theoretically could have<br/>\n&gt; made use of the mistwalker more than a druid, yet the staff (forbidden<br/>\n&gt; rites I assume) is also a pretty kick butt melee weapon and just as<br/>\n&gt; useless in the hands of a cleric as the mistwalker would be <br/>\n&gt; in the hands<br/>\n&gt; of a druid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is also the same kind of attitude that was used to keep Bards out<br/>\n&gt; of the early lottos for Ykeshas on my server and it still <br/>\n&gt; pisses me off. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
