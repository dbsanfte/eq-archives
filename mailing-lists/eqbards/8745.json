Now i<br/>\ncan start them up and they get about the same number of missed notes as the<br/>\nother songs it seems, which is great news. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:03 AM 10/14/1999 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Strange, I was thinking it was odd over the last 2 days (even before the<br/>\n&gt;patch) that I seemed to be getting MORE missed notes in general on all my<br/>\n&gt;songs that I usually do.  I can&#39;t really think of anything to attribute this<br/>\n&gt;to logically but I definitely did not notice less missed notes :-(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Faras<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 14, 1999 10:52 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch downtime again this morning (Thursday)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; i tried fufil&#39;s also (did not try either tuyen&#39;s song) and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; all i got was 3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ticks of 10dmg and -14 magic resistance.  no change with <br/>\n&gt;&gt; mistmoore battle<br/>\n&gt;&gt; drum.  from what i remember this is exactly what it was <br/>\n&gt;&gt; pre-patch.  oh well.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; along with that and no breastplate a pretty disappointing day.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oh, I almost forgot too... anyone notice less missed notes?  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; i started,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stopped, and restarted the level 50 song 10 times with no <br/>\n&gt;&gt; missed notes.  i<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was only confirming what another 50 bard noticed.  that would <br/>\n&gt;&gt; be impossible<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pre-patch, that song missed notes more than not.  so one good <br/>\n&gt;&gt; thing at least<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with <br/>\n&gt;the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
