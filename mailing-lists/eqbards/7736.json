I call for my 26 ranger<br/>\nfriend who is in zone to come help.  Some one said dispell him and he is no<br/>\nproblem - well ok but I don&#39;t got a song for that. So, I buff us and played<br/>\nguardian rythmns. The ranger gave us enduring breath.  Webbie is a nasty<br/>\ncaster and burned the hell out of my ranger pal - he died infact.  Now its<br/>\nme and webbie about half and half in health.  I am just not getting hits on<br/>\nhim trying to melee in the water.  The only damage song I got loaded is<br/>\nBellow - so I apply it liberally and this does him in.  I finished the fight<br/>\nwith less that a bub of hp left.  Very close call.  With 20-20 hind sight, I<br/>\ncan see that there is a green crock swimming nearby which would have been<br/>\ndeath if he got into the  melee (if I had used AE chords for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nGot the watercrystal staff 5dam/28dly wt 6.
