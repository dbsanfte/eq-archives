I am <br/>\nfully aware of the capabilities of the other melee classes with double <br/>\nattack, riposte, etc., and if you think I meant general weapon damage across <br/>\nall classes...well, this is a bard forum. I will always believe that is in <br/>\n*MY* best interest to not use Yaks because most of my time is spent on large <br/>\nraids where I want as little attention to myself as possible. I have seen <br/>\nlog analyes but have not performed any tests myself. I have seen both <br/>\nweapons compared endlessly with this person or that person comparing logs <br/>\nand analyzing with different formulas. I&#39;ve seen tests where the yak beat <br/>\nout the wak, and I&#39;ve seen tests where Waks beat out Yak with procs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I think it comes down to a trade off situation for us bards. At <br/>\nthe lower levels of proccing (37-45) I loved my Ykeshas because most of my <br/>\ntime was spent in guk or Sol B. After 46 when you start hitting the planes <br/>\nand go on FG/Phinigel raids regularly I think they become a liability. But <br/>\nhey - it&#39;s just my opinion, and I believe a Yak &quot;vastly&quot; outdamaging a wak <br/>\nin the hands of a bard can be considered exaggeration most of the time (in <br/>\nlonger fights).<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n50th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kevin L.

The Wakizashi&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;dmg output is not significant enough during a fight to out-dmg a y&#39;kesha<br/>\n&gt;once the Y&#39;kesha procs.  Remember, Rangers have Dual Wield AND Double<br/>\n&gt;Attack, so they tend to proc more often than us when using them.  My Ranger<br/>\n&gt;proc&#39;s between 3 and 5 times a fight.  So 3*70 or 5*70 additional dmg.  <br/>\n&gt;Many<br/>\n&gt;rangers average higher (My ranger&#39;s dex is horrible (&lt;80)) and I still<br/>\n&gt;regularly proc 5 times a fight.  A ranger with 100 dex will *regularly* <br/>\n&gt;proc<br/>\n&gt;between 4 and 7 times a fight. Sometimes more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ciao!  As I said the rangers discussed it.  The numbers may be different <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;Bards since we don&#39;t have Double Attack or the Rangers THAC0 table and thus<br/>\n&gt;hit a LOT less often.  But I suspect people will find that the Y&#39;kesha will<br/>\n&gt;still edge the Waki&#39;s out in dmg.  Though not by nearly as much as it did<br/>\n&gt;for rangers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope this clears up my post ;)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
