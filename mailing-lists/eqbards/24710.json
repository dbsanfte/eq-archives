As a bard,<br/>\nnaturally I was curious as to who got the scales. When I heard that 2<br/>\ndropped ( has it always been that she drops two?), I said to myself that I<br/>\nneeded to get my alt up and Vox capable. If our guild would host it, we&#39;d<br/>\nfully random the scales, not to bards only. I was thinking that if everyone<br/>\ncan roll on the scale(s), more people may attend. It&#39;s already stated that<br/>\nif one of our guildmates or allied members win the lotto, they will give me<br/>\nthe scale. I don&#39;t know how fair it all sounds, but as the hosting guild, we<br/>\ncould actually claim a dragonscale to our own, no matter what but we aren&#39;t.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem so underhanded if you think about it. :) A kill is a kill.<br/>\nWhat is done with the loot is up to the hosting party, and we want to be<br/>\nfair as we can!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of last weekend, I have everything but the 2 dragonscales and trak guts,<br/>\nand the minor metal bits.
