For instance last week I was in a group<br/>\nthat teleported into the druid gate in North Karana. Unfortunately there was<br/>\na giant right by the gate and he attacked us. Because I have a fast<br/>\nconnection I regained control first and used MMM to get a bit of space<br/>\nbetween us and the giant - we all survived.<br/>\nIts also handy in duelling if you get blinded, by a paladin for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also used identify last week to find out which part of the rune of one eye<br/>\nI had for my lambent armour quests. Its the only time I have used this song<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to see identify replaced but MMM is far from useless IMHO, at<br/>\nleast while there is still stuff to fight outside. I have never used the<br/>\npsalm series in anger and would like to see these made more useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBruen Bladesong<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 18 Feb 2000 09:01:08 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Tim Burke&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjohnburke@...\">tjohnburke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: What about the lvl 24 song?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t say that I have ever groupped with anybody that said...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...my god kerouac - thank god your here... please play that see invis song<br/>\nplease&quot;<br/>\nor<br/>\n&quot;...wow, never knew bards could sing a so I could see invis - cool&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t most casters get see invis WAY before  lvl 24?
