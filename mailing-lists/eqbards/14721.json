What songs are you talking about?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are in Guk without an enchanter, you are probably the person who will<br/>\n&gt; need to do crowd control.  So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>\n&gt; mob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>\n&gt; want to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>\n&gt; does not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>\nthe zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>\ntower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>\n&gt; celerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>\n&gt; a situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.  And<br/>\n&gt; playing area effect damage songs is not the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>\nup screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>\nevac. The train that came back 15 sec later with the feared frogs was<br/>\nthe scariest I&#39;d seen there. We got all the gargoyles and every other<br/>\nfrog in the tower too. Heh.
