We had two fulls and a partial group in front of the<br/>\ngiant castle and all but 3 of us went LD.  No one else in the zone was<br/>\nspared.  Luckily the three of us could handle the two giants the groups had<br/>\nbeen fighting, but I hear about 20 people zone-wide died from that incident<br/>\nwhatever caused it.  Its very eerie to be staring at 12+ LD people at once<br/>\ngetting beat on by giants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a serious problem with this the other night in the Overthere zone.  It<br/>\nwas around midnight Hawaii time and my group (4 others) were fighting<br/>\nentire bub of EXP due to lag.  To say the least I was quite pissed off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time of the disconnect there were only around 10 people in the zone<br/>\nand around 600 people on the server.  Thats not enough people to cause<br/>\nnormal lag so the only explanation I think is valid is there was either a<br/>\nserver problem or a router problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
