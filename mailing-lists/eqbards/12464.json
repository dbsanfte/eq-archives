The problem is, leveling generally is<br/>\nboring.  I get bored trying to stay in one place for long, much less at one<br/>\ncamp.  Whenever I see that someone stayed in the Highkeep basement for 3<br/>\nlevels or is Cazic for 5 levels, I get that sick feeling in the pit of my<br/>\nstomach.  If that&#39;s what it takes to level beyond 25 I never will.  Doing<br/>\nthose things is not fun for me in the least, and if the game isn&#39;t fun I<br/>\nwon&#39;t play, pure and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 9:30 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Any tips.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I love Everquest and have done ever since I started playing 7-8 months<br/>\nago. My problem is, I&#39;m crap at levelling, to give you an idea I think I&#39;m<br/>\n31 days old and level 32. Thats almost 24 hours per level *sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of level you level 40+&#39;ers on this list so I was wondering,<br/>\nhow can I get a steady gain in experience? And the answer, &quot;don&#39;t die as<br/>\nmuch&quot;, doesn&#39;t really help. I wish I could die less than I do but I&#39;m just<br/>\nunlucky I guess. It&#39;s not my equipment that sucks just the rate I level at.<br/>\nI have good equipment for my level, Full Lambent, Various magic items<br/>\nDwb&#39;s, Exe Hood etc and plat jewellery. Plus I have about 1.5-2k in cash in<br/>\nthe bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was quite pleased last night with the 2 bubs exp however I did play for<br/>\nabout 7-8 hours so thats crap in comparison, I have tried places like<br/>\nHighkeep and it just gets dull and boring. Sol A is usually good but I<br/>\nstill get killed there sometimes and I end up with next to no exp made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info and advice would be greatly appreciated.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 32 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
