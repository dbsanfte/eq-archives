I love this game, I think it&#39;s the best game ever and I<br/>\nhope to play it for a long time.  Call me gullible but I don&#39;t think Verant<br/>\nis trying to manipulate us.  I think their intentions are actually to create<br/>\na fun, well balanced game that people enjoy playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBut last night, we had an incident which was particularly<br/>\nfrustrating.  I was playing my Shaman (there was a Bard in our group so I<br/>\nguess it&#39;s somewhat relevant :P) and we were camping the throne room in<br/>\nCT... we had held it for several hours with no problems.  So in comes high<br/>\nlevel character - high 40s.  Doesn&#39;t say a word, is invisible, when we ask<br/>\nwhat he is there for he says &quot;piss off&quot; and then proceeds to kill steal the<br/>\nTae in one cast.  Steals the rubi as well.. but oh well, ks is part of the<br/>\ngame right? I asked him why, he says &quot;I&#39;m evil - deal with it&quot;... well, at<br/>\nleast he role plays :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTwenty minutes later, Shadownight walks in - level 41 with<br/>\nlevel 41 cleric friend.  I actually know and am &quot;friends&quot; with the SK. My<br/>\ngroup rather tiredly confirms that he is there to KS from us... I ask him<br/>\nwhy... he says to us (dressed in full rubicite) &quot;I don&#39;t have much time to<br/>\nget this i... I am selling my account on ebay and will need this rubi to<br/>\ntwink my level 1 character on my new account.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIs it me, or is this just ridiculous?  I guess the point of<br/>\nthis rather long winded post is that it is this stuff which makes the game<br/>\nless enjoyable to me, not the lack of binding ability. I guess this is just<br/>\npart of the game now, and I will put off my dreams of rubi pants until level<br/>\n40+ when I will lower myself to KS just because I can. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTani 15th Bard<br/>\n\t\tHalana 30th Shaman<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\tDouglass Family [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tMonday, October 04, 1999 9:16 AM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Hey this<br/>\nsounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Douglass Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThis game is very enjoyable even as a casual<br/>\nplayer, which is what I have to<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcall myself, Ive been playing since release<br/>\nand Im still a bard of almost 25<br/>\n\t\t\t\tlevels, now I do have many more<br/>\npersonalities, in their teens, and here is<br/>\n\t\t\t\twhy......
