A few were<br/>\nfriends of mine so I asked them if I was too low to come (I&#39;m a 33 bard).<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t have an enchanter with them so they were glad to have me along.<br/>\nSomeone met me in Dagnors and gave me a waterstone, see invis, and invis<br/>\nbuff and off we went.  When I zoned into Kedge I was truly amazed.  I only<br/>\nswam through a small portion of the zone until we got to where everyone was<br/>\nat but my first impression is that it is a well designed zone in terms of<br/>\nlayout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we started fighting my primary role was clarity, stamina song and<br/>\nanthem.  Whenever we got a caster I weaved in Elemental Rhythms.  Every once<br/>\nin a while I got a Bellow to stick.  The melee damage I did was so small in<br/>\ncomparison to everyone else that I rarely got attacked.  However, when I did<br/>\nget hit it was often for 90-100 damage.  That wasn&#39;t a big deal for the most<br/>\npart though.  I dont think I ever lost more than one bub of health the<br/>\nentire night. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all it was a fun night.  I got to go somewhere I had never been<br/>\nbefore.  At 33d level, I got experience with a level 47 in the group (not<br/>\nmuch though).  I wasn&#39;t there for experience in the first place so that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a big deal.  Only thing I was disappointed about was that my swimming<br/>\nskill only went up 2 points during the four hours I was there:-)  So if you<br/>\nare 32+ and want to go to Kedge but were worried that you were too low in<br/>\nlevel don&#39;t let that stop you as bards are a very valuable class in that<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
