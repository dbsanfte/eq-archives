It was late at night and we had<br/>\nthe entire place to ourselves.  The party consisted of a 35 enchanter, 34<br/>\nranger, 34 paladin, 32 cleric, 27 bard and 30 bard(me).  Initially we were<br/>\ncamping along the outside wall.  The ranger pulled, the enchanter had crowd<br/>\ncontrol duties, and the other bard and I were able to keep six different songs<br/>\nup all the time.  The ranger was a very good puller and never got more than two<br/>\nmobs at a time.  Every combat was very efficient and no one ever lost more than<br/>\none bub of health.  We were there for over an hour and decided that based on our<br/>\nsuccess, we would move up to the top of the pyramid where the Archon spawns.<br/>\nEveryone got fully buffed (I had 10 buff icons showing), full mana and we headed<br/>\nup to the Archon invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to the top safely and gathered at one of the corners near to the steps<br/>\nleading into the pyramid.   There was a full spawn waiting for us at the steps,<br/>\nplus whatever was inside the pyramid.  I told everyone to hold tight.  Sent a<br/>\nprivate /tell to the enchanter (Rakadar).  Rakadar and I have grouped together<br/>\non numerous occasions since we were both 5th level.  He is far and away the best<br/>\nenchanter I have ever grouped with, a master at controlling a battle with his<br/>\ncrowd control spells.  I told him that with the number of mobs in front of us,<br/>\nhe would likely die if he tried an AE mez spell.  My reasoning was that there<br/>\nwas no way for the party to kill enough mobs before the AE mez wore off.  Once<br/>\nthe spell wore off and everything started attacking him, he most likely would<br/>\nhave trouble getting another AE mez off.  He agreed with my assessment.  He then<br/>\ntold me that if I tried putting them all to sleep with lullaby, then I would<br/>\nlikely die.  I agreed with his assessment.  Here is where the other bard (a<br/>\nguildmate of mine) comes into play.  I informed the other bard that during the<br/>\nfight, I would continually be singing Lullaby.  I told him to weave anthem and<br/>\nlullaby continuously and mix in Hymn ever few rounds.  The enchanter would charm<br/>\none of the casting lizards and then focus on stunning the mob we were facing.  I<br/>\ninformed everyone of the plan and reminded the cleric to watch out for the two<br/>\nbards health since we would be singing Lullaby.  Time to kick some lizard butt.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all /assisted the ranger and started the fight.  I started up Lullaby and was<br/>\nhorrified when I saw that I had put 10 lizards to sleep.  A couple of people<br/>\nstated something to the effect of &quot;Oh crap.  We got 10 freaking lizards now.  We<br/>\nshould have stayed by the wall&quot;.  I assumed I would be the first to die.  Here<br/>\nis where I received a pleasant surprise.  Out of the 10 lizards we were facing,<br/>\nthe only one attacking back was the one the tanks were meleeing.  For the most<br/>\npart, nothing was attacking me at all.  Everyone once in a while I would get<br/>\nattacked but I eventually put the mob back to sleep.  On a couple of occasions<br/>\nwhen I did get attacked, I got stunned and stop singing Lullaby.  When this<br/>\nhappened and mobs woke up, instead of attacking me the mobs attacked the lower<br/>\nlevel bard, who was weaving in Lullaby/Hymn as well.  Throughout the coarse of<br/>\nthe battle, he was the only player who was took any serious damage.  The cleric<br/>\ntook care of that though.  As soon as I was able to get Lullaby back up, the<br/>\nsituation was back in control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSlowly but surely, we killed off the intial 10 mobs.  However, this took us so<br/>\nlong that as we got down to the last few mobs, new ones spawned along the steps.<br/>\nI just kept singing Lullaby the entire fight.  Eventually we killed off all the<br/>\nmobs.  All told, I think we were fighting lizards continuously for over 15<br/>\nminutes.   We all stood around in disbelief at what we had just accomplished.<br/>\nFinal tally was Us:15 Lizards:0.  Everyone started hooting and hollering and<br/>\npatting each other on the back.  Everyone was out of mana but no one was below<br/>\n60% health.  Everyone agreed that the reason for our success were me and the<br/>\nother bard keeping all the mobs out of the fight.  To say the least I was<br/>\necstatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn hindsight, I wished I would have turned on the log file function prior to the<br/>\nfight so I could have collected some test data for the ongoing Lullaby issue.<br/>\nLike so many of us, I was convinced the song was broken.  It may be that two<br/>\nbards singing Lullaby (one continuously and the other weaving it in) negated the<br/>\nproblem of mobs still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>\nresisted my song the first time, he still had to resist the other bards song.<br/>\nI think it also helped that my charisma was 149 and the other bards was 145<br/>\n(with sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night was the most fun<br/>\nI&#39;ve had playing EQ in a long time and that I&#39;m further convinced that a bard<br/>\nand enchanter in the same group make a lethal combination.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
