The first is that while most dungeons become safer with more<br/>\ngroups in them, Sol A becomes more dangerous with more groups.  There were<br/>\nenough groups in Sol A last nite that every time any group in the front<br/>\nareas got a bad pull, it ended up training every single group in that area<br/>\none at a time.  Very ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second conclusion is far more unsettling although it does seem to<br/>\nexplain why Verant&#39;s idea of how the game works is so different from<br/>\nreality.  It all stems from one fateful choice on their part in trying to<br/>\nbalance mobs that were not as hard as they should be.  To do this they added<br/>\nhp&#39;s.  A simple solution?  Not really.  It changed the whole dynamic of the<br/>\ngame and it has never recovered.  By adding hp&#39;s instead of increasing<br/>\ndamage dealt, too low partly due to the dual wield bug, they totally changed<br/>\nthe way mobs must be fought.  In the old days DoT&#39;s weren&#39;t so powerful<br/>\nbecause the mobs would often die before they ran their course.  Now mobs<br/>\nhave so many hp&#39;s all the DoT&#39;s run thru and even run out.  DD&#39;s and melee<br/>\nattacks though have been reduced in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the hp&#39;s hadn&#39;t been increased, the primary strategy in killing mobs<br/>\nwould be to kill them fast.  This would depower DoT&#39;s in group combat, but<br/>\nwould put wizards back where they belong at the head of the quick killer as<br/>\nfar as caster&#39;s go.  It would also allow melee attacks to be more effective.<br/>\nThe increased hp&#39;s have changed the strategy from one of killing quickly to<br/>\nkilling steadily.  Killing steadily is not conducive to stopping runner and<br/>\nso causes more trains than if the mobs actually could be killed quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason melee types suffer from the change from fast to steady when it<br/>\nseems counterintuitive is deceptive.  Although the melee class has more<br/>\n&#39;time&#39; it seems to do damage and is thus more effective, in reality this<br/>\nisn&#39;t so.  Unlike the DoT which is fire and forget, the melee class is on a<br/>\ndifferent clock.  The DoT is on &#39;real time&#39;.  If a fight lasts longer it<br/>\ndoes more damage.  The melee person is on &#39;hp time&#39;.  No matter how long a<br/>\nfight lasts, the melee person&#39;s clock is limited to his/her own hp&#39;s.  When<br/>\nthey run out, the person is done fighting whether the fight is over or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis explains many of Verant&#39;s misconceptions.  If hp&#39;s of mobs were less,<br/>\nas in Beta, then Wizards would be very balanced.  Melee types would die less<br/>\nthan casters.  Not needing mana would mean something significant.  Mob<br/>\nattack slowdowns would be vital.  Damage absorption shields would be vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one choice of how to fix a problem has caused innumerable others.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure how it could be fixed now, or if even it could without a lot of<br/>\npain.  I sure hope it is something they realize for EQ2 however.  I wonder<br/>\nhow bad it would really be if they took a stab at it.  Reduced the hp&#39;s of<br/>\nall the mobs to the original pre buffed numbers and fixed the dual wield<br/>\nproblem.  It might appear ugly at first, but I think it would put the game<br/>\nback onto the track they think it is on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
