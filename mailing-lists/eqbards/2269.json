He spawns up on the ledge by the west gate of High Pass Keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrenix, himself, isn&#39;t that tough. I solo&#39;d him at 20th level. A group of<br/>\n15s can take him fairly easily. What&#39;s hard is the LONNNNNNNNG wait most<br/>\npeople have to endure, and the CAMPERS galore, and the numerous gnolls you<br/>\nhave to wade through until Grenix shows up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a guard nearby who will jump in and steal your kill if you get<br/>\ntoo close to him. I watched the Guard kill Grenix once as about a dozen<br/>\npeople stood around crying about it (smile).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am told, though, that Grenix&#39;s spawnrate has been recently more<br/>\n&quot;Randomized&quot;. I do not know for sure, as I got my Tommy and left, never to<br/>\nreturn to that ledge. Some say he can spawn 3 times an hour now, while<br/>\nothers say he still only spawns twice a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, Grenix&#39;s brother, Vexven, also pops in the same area, and<br/>\ncarries a nice shield called the Cracked Darkwood shield. VERY nice. From<br/>\nwhat&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, Vexven usually shows up within 30 minutes to 2 hours after<br/>\nGrenix shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - Bertox<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 22, 1999 7:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Weapons of choice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The dirk is the best weapon you can get for free at such a low lvl too.
