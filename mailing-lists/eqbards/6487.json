It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it and<br/>\nit overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>\ntry to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>\nability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>\nwith the Levitate spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>\nsack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to accept<br/>\nthat our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>\nand hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>\nsack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>\ngraphic for the brass horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>\noverall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>\ninclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>\nperson at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>\noverlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>\nto be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>\nissues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>\nour Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>\naffect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already burdened<br/>\ndevelopment resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>\nus with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend to<br/>\naddress the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari brass<br/>\nhorn).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nHalf-Elf Bard of the 26th song<br/>\nCrimson Legacy<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
