He was a high elf but<br/>\nwould almost always have the human illusion up.  He said that the reason for<br/>\nthis is that he would get more EXP as a human instead of a high elf.<br/>\nSupposedly this was common knowledge among the enchanter community.  Now I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know for certain if this is a fact or not, but if it is true, then it<br/>\nwould be a safe assumption that bards with a DE illusion would get the same<br/>\nEXP modifier as true DEs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 11, 2000 2:59 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Mask of Deception and XP Penalties<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been told that ShowEQ shows that when you are using the guise<br/>\nillusion dark elf your exp table gets changed to dark elf, so I guess<br/>\nit&#39;s possible, though I haven&#39;t heard of it being tested yet. All bards<br/>\nseem to get the same exp penalty regardless of race so I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nyou would get a change or not. When I heard the issue discussed it was<br/>\nfrom testing a warrior with the pre-patch guise so the exp difference<br/>\nwould matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if a troll sk who used the old guise would actually need less<br/>\nexp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Jun 11/00, Stephen Quarterman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steveq@...\">steveq@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; While wandering around the Lake of Ill Omen zone I was approaced by a<br/>\nperson<br/>\n&gt; who goes by the name of Wabs.
