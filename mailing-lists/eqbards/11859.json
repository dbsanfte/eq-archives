My<br/>\nLullaby works so well that people explicitly ask for it now in any fight with 3 or more MOBs (provided we<br/>\nhave no Enchanter).  It gets resisted some, but it still takes the extra (unattacked) MOBs out of the<br/>\nfight for 50-75% of the time.  This is not as useful as Enchanter Mes, of course, and it entirely ties up<br/>\nmy songs for much of the fight, but it&#39;s a lot better than dying.  My level 32-36 group took out those<br/>\nfive Greater Ice Bones in a single battle, with about half damage and half mana drain overall.  Not that<br/>\nanyone wanted to try it a second time...<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
