I can do much <br/>\nmore damage buffing/healing/debuffing then I can with a couple of puny <br/>\nblades.  Every since I demolished a lvl 26th Paladin at 22nd lvl, using no <br/>\nweapons BTW, I have been a firm believer in the power of the Bard&#39;s song.  <br/>\nIf you are limiting yourself to only being on the front line swinging your <br/>\nsword at the creatures face, you are limiting yourself and not helping the <br/>\nparty to your full abilities.  It also takes a lot more bravely to face down <br/>\na horde of ice goblins with nothing more then a lute equiped :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Baker, Potter, and Smith<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;SpudSucker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sprite@...\">sprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Bard petition ideas (Long)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 7 Aug 1999 20:24:18 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;SpudSucker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sprite@...\">sprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Give me a noncombatant role any day of the week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think overall as a class - MOST bards - at least those well suited to <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;role have matured past having to be the center of attention and HERO of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Uh... In EQ there really isn&#39;t much non combat (Trade Skills), and what<br/>\n&gt;minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>\n&gt;of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>\n&gt;would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>\n&gt;NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;you are successful or nothing if you fail, and then do it over and over and<br/>\n&gt;over and over again.  At least combat is a little more complex then that,<br/>\n&gt;even if a bard is a twitch character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt;have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>\n&gt;ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>\n&gt;get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>\n&gt;diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>\n&gt;get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>\n&gt;it fun to do so much!<br/>\n&gt;-Sprite </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
