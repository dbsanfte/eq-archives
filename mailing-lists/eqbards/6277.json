The problem now is actually finding two like-level mobs<br/>\nto play charm tricks with, and managing to keep them far<br/>\nenough from other people so that they don&#39;t decide to attack<br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t find anything else to fight.  (For some<br/>\nreason most people don&#39;t seem to understand that if two mobs<br/>\nare fighting each other, then someone is causing it.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t see a player fighting them so they think the mobs are<br/>\nfree.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem yet on the younger shards (I<br/>\nsaw lots of giants last night on Tunare), but it&#39;s painfully<br/>\nevident on the older ones.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen two giants<br/>\nat once (except ice giants) in the entire last month on<br/>\nKarana.  And when we did try fighting ice giants, the kill<br/>\nstealers descended like flies to sh!t within a half hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
