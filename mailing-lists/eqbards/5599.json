What he actually means is that they use the test server to see who<br/>\nwill notice the changes. If they don&#39;t generate huge complaints they<br/>\nsneak them onto the regular server without mentioning the change in the<br/>\nupdate notice. If they are noticed and the complaints are loud enough<br/>\nthey withdraw them and try to slide something less noticable in later.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
