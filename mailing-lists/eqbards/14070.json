And I agree, when I get to those levels, I&#39;m going to be annoyed that the game<br/>\nhas gotten boring.  However, that does not change my assertion, that when I get bored playing the game, I<br/>\nwill *stop* playing the game.  I&#39;ll certainly do my share to try to get Verant to make the game better for<br/>\nme, but I&#39;ll not hold my breath.  And when (not if, since they simply cannot, with this game, have<br/>\ninfinite content) they fail to make it less boring for me, I will stop playing and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday a game company, maybe even Verant, will make a MMORPG that has an easy and fullproof content<br/>\ngeneration system, so GMs can generate literally infinite quests, items, and situations that will all be<br/>\nbalanced, unexploitable, and fun for everyone in real time.  It will happen.  But not with EQ.  EQ is just<br/>\nanother step in the right direction toward the game we all want to play for the rest of our lives.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not to get your hackles up Ryan.
