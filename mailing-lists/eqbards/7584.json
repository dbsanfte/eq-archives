I have not<br/>\nseen such an aggressive thread in weeks here...and with over 60 posts a day?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think everyone has some excellent points and makes some good arguments but<br/>\nthe whole thing is starting to be as pointless and repetitive as flogging a<br/>\ndead horse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLets all agree to disagree and move forward with some new discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure where the debate over what classes are hybrids and what classes<br/>\nare not is leading and I&#39;m not sure it really makes any difference.  I know<br/>\nsome people are going to be offended and angered at me for saying so, and I<br/>\napologize to you profusely, but please give this whole Ping-Pong match a<br/>\nrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think there is a point to arguing over bind because if Verant<br/>\ndecides in the future to make some change in this area it is going to have<br/>\nto be a sweeping change that gratifies all the classes that currently don&#39;t<br/>\nget to self-bind or bind outside of cities.  And if they took binding<br/>\noutside of cities away from the classes that can do it...you can imagine<br/>\nwhat EQVault&#39;s forums would look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like you all and respect your opinions but this has gone a bit too far<br/>\ndon&#39;t you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
