My dual wield skill has gotten high<br/>\nenough that it goes off several times in succession.  Last<br/>\nnight with a dirk (delay 23, primary) and whip (delay 28,<br/>\nsecondary) equipped, I watched it go off 4 times in<br/>\nsuccession.  The messages went:<br/>\n<br/>\nwhip<br/>\ndirk<br/>\n [pause]<br/>\ndirk<br/>\nwhip<br/>\n [pause]<br/>\ndirk<br/>\n [pause]<br/>\nwhip<br/>\n [pause]<br/>\ndirk<br/>\n [pause]<br/>\ndirk<br/>\nwhip<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the two swing independent of each other, each at their own<br/>\ndelay.  The minotaur axe and combine longsword have very<br/>\nsimilar damage/delay ratios.  I wouldn&#39;t fret over which one<br/>\nyou have equipped in your primary hand.  I would think you&#39;d<br/>\nwant the combine in your primary so you don&#39;t have to switch<br/>\nweapons if you run into a magic-only mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
