Bummer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t do any hard number crunching test with it, but it did not appear to<br/>\nbe significantly improved as far as damage goes when sung so I switched to<br/>\nthe drum (normal hand drum, I am not yet among the lucky battle bangers) and<br/>\ntried it and the damage seemed significant, appeared to do around 50 damage<br/>\ntotal over the duration of the DoT (I targeted myself and was having much<br/>\nlag and PL last night so the results cant be considered very accurate but<br/>\nonly approximate).  I&#39;m guessing this is similar to the difference between<br/>\nsinging DD and playing it with a brass horn, night and day as someone<br/>\nrecently noted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am used to being a battle bard so it is hard to get used to dropping my<br/>\nweapons and holding an instrument during combat and I often get tells from<br/>\ngroup members who think I forgot to re-equip my weapons and say &quot;Faras, your<br/>\nfighting with your drum again!&quot;.  Heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sort of whish there was some visual indication that the song pulsed like<br/>\nin other direct damage songs such as bellow, with fufils you have to pay<br/>\nclose attention to that eye-straining dark blue on dark gray text as it<br/>\nflies by amongst the other rapid-fire spams during a fight.  Makes using it<br/>\ndifficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nC&#39;est La Vie<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
