He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>\nback. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>\nattacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>\ntarget, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>\nwith Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>\nback to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>\nwithout being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>\n2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>\nIt was quite a sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>\nnew player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>\nhe&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>\nprimary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>\nquestions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
