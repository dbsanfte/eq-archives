I<br/>\nmodeled Glyphed as the &quot;Anti-Bard&quot; (no offense guys, i still like my bard<br/>\nbetter).  I wrote a brief history on Glyphed...it can be found at:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.wrathofdragonclaw.org  <br/>\n(you have to scroll down the left frame to the bottom, and then click on the<br/>\n&quot;Glyphed&quot; button)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI figured since Mistmoore and League of Antonican Bards were factions in<br/>\nopposition, it was actually an opportunity to roleplay something in my<br/>\npatterned disjointed and goofy way.<br/>\n<br/>\nsome of the goofy names that i have seen on Prexus:<br/>\nKittka t&#39;bar (actually a guildmate)<br/>\nTommy Hillfinger (which has been changed by gms)<br/>\nBuffysommers (don&#39;t know if she has a surname....DE necro btw)<br/>\n<br/>\none that i liked was<br/>\n<br/>\nXtra Large (troll warrior i think)<br/>\n<br/>\nbut i am sure everyone has a ton of names they have seen like this<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd Song Half Elf Bard<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss<br/>\n27th Level Dark Elf Magician<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m suprised verant lets you keep that name, but then again, despite the so<br/>\n&gt;called rules on character names I have seen a lot of stupid player names<br/>\n&gt;(not saying yours is stupid).  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I *almost* reported a pc one afternoon at the bazaar on E&#39;ci - I was<br/>\n&gt;auctioning a couple of black pearls at the tunnel and got a tell from an<br/>\n&gt;enchanter named &quot;Balonie&quot; who said to come meet her by the first inn.  I ran<br/>\n&gt;over and when I got close to her I saw that her last name was &quot;Sandwych&quot; -<br/>\n&gt;and this was no newbie either.  It kind of ticked me off at first but I<br/>\n&gt;finally I decided not to be whistle blower and went ahead and sold the<br/>\n&gt;pearls and went about my business.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
