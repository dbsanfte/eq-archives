Tani started out untwinked, worked hard through<br/>\nlevel 20ish.  But then I started to find little extra pieces of armor and<br/>\ntwink her out a bit.  So from level 20 to 40, shes been in lake of ill omen,<br/>\nfrontier mountains, overthere and now iceclad.  I love soloing and duoing<br/>\nher.. its great fun.  But I&#39;ve never had much of this &quot;bard aggro&quot; problem I<br/>\nalways hear about... until last night.<br/>\n <br/>\nNot sure what happened, all I know is that dire wolves usually have a fairly<br/>\nsmall aggro radius, they will attack but you practically have to pull their<br/>\ntails.  Well, after fighting a while, I run to a wolf and start fighting..<br/>\nsuddenly, I notice another wolf running right at me from a ways off.  I move<br/>\na little out of his path and notice that he veers right towards me.  &quot;Hrm&quot; I<br/>\nthink, this is odd.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSuddenly I realize my health bar is dropping rappidly, and I f9 and see<br/>\nthere are 3 or 4 wolves on me.. &quot;Hrm&quot; I think again, and fire up selos...<br/>\nstart running a little, thinking i will kite them a bit.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI start running and NO JOKE, all these wolves just start joining in, running<br/>\nfrom out of sight to find me.. I f9 again and notice literally a PACK of<br/>\ndire wolves after me - can easily count 8 or 9... &quot;Hrm&quot;....  Now a sane<br/>\nperson would zone, but I am anything but sane.  My friend had another<br/>\nfriend&#39;s druid logged at the gate, so I say &quot;Log Erico in and help<br/>\nme!!!!&quot;... he does so and we procede to kite, melee, dot and otherwise kill<br/>\nthem over the next 15 - 20 minutes.  I may have miscounted but i think there<br/>\nwere at least 12 with more adding in now and then.<br/>\n <br/>\nThinking &quot;Ok they&#39;re all dead&quot; I start out again.  I take two steps.. and a<br/>\ndire wolf charges me... start fighting him, and notice 2 more charging me<br/>\nout of nowhere....this continues for 10 minutes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI finally zone, come back, all is happy... then group with erico for wolf<br/>\nform and .... all that aggro is back on me again!!!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, most of you probably have this happen regularly but it was a first<br/>\nfor me and it was INSANE.  My roomates were wondering why I was cackling and<br/>\nlaughing at midnight.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe good news is I got a full bubble of yellow in 40 in half an hour *grins*<br/>\n <br/>\nHalana, 58th Shaman<br/>\nTani, 40th Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
