Bard Melee is pathetic after level 20, when all the other<br/>\nHybrids get double attack.  After 20th level we start to get really dusted<br/>\nin melee ability.  After 16th they start to dust us in defensive as well so<br/>\nby level 22 or so we are horrendously behind the power curve melee wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard = Caster in Plate, just like a cleric, with slightly better offense<br/>\nskill and a slightly higher dodge cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually Cleric is a VERY good comparison, melee power wise, to a bard.<br/>\nExcept that they only get 4 points per level for OFFENSE and DEFENSE and we<br/>\nget 5.  And their Dodge, I believe, is capped at 75<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically a Bard is a Caster with pretentions at being melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny bard who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves.

It seems now that more bards<br/>\n&gt; are beginning to agree that our melee skills are not far beyond those of<br/>\n&gt; some of the &quot;pure&quot; casters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually his statement is exactly right.  Our Melee skills are hardly our<br/>\n&gt; defining trait.  Being only barely a notch above shaman and druids in our<br/>\n&gt; melee ability.  Sure we get dual wield but they can wield 2h blunt<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\n&gt; So we&#39;re better at melee, but not near on par with the &#39;true&#39; melee<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n&gt; that get dual wield and double attack or just double attack but can wield<br/>\n&gt; 2hs weapons or 1hs and use a shield to bash.  Either way, any of the real<br/>\n&gt; melee classes are &quot;defined&quot; by their melee skills.  We are &quot;defined&quot; by<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; ability to sing songs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (and almost any bard will tell you that our songs are far more powerful<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; our melee ability)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Missing old school friends?
