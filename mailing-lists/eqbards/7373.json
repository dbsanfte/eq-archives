(You can, but<br/>\n&gt;switching targets can get tricky.)  So just keep your pet targeted, and<br/>\n&gt;equip an instrument to concentrate on buffing/healing your party instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great song analysis on charm John.  The happy day that I can use this song<br/>\nis still 3 levels away.  Your analysis answered all my questions and opened<br/>\nmy eyes in some areas previously unconsidered.   Sorry for responding a<br/>\nlittle bit behind the &#39;times&#39; but I thought this little tidbit was worth<br/>\nthrowing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant added in the last month or two, the Double F1 targetting option.<br/>\nBasically, press F1, you will now be targetted on yourself, press F1 a<br/>\nsecond time, and your pet is now targetted.  This is from an old<br/>\nnecromancer&#39;s point of view, but it does work with summoned skeletons, as<br/>\nwell as &lt;grins wickedly&gt; charmed undead (A spectre says, &quot;As you wish<br/>\nMaster&quot;).  I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to try charming as a bard, but I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming it will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that you are better off charming and singing party buff songs, than<br/>\ntrying to jump into melee another pulled NPC.  Your pet is going to be able<br/>\nto dish out much more damage than a bard, and I imagine it would be very<br/>\neasy to lose control of your pet when you are trying to recharm and &lt;You are<br/>\nstunned&gt; graces your display.<br/>\n<br/>\nKassao, 24th Half Elf Bard<br/>\nMizst, 39th Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
