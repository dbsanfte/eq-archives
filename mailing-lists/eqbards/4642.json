Yes it gets<br/>\nresisted, but that&#39;s really besides the point.  When your<br/>\nparty ends up with 4-10 mobs on it, Lullaby can make it seem<br/>\nlike 2-3.  They&#39;ll occasionally resist or wake up and take a<br/>\nwhack at you, but most of them will stay asleep, and your<br/>\nparty will love you because you&#39;ve turned a hopeless situation<br/>\ninto an easy win.  Just make sure you have a healer (because<br/>\nyou&#39;re going to be the center of attention of every mob), and<br/>\neveryone in your party attacks the same thing at once (because<br/>\nattacking them wakes them up, and they&#39;ll usually whack on the<br/>\nbard when awake).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother use of Lullaby is that if it takes, it is 100%<br/>\nguaranteed to interrupt a spellcaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at level 16).

It&#39;s nice for sorting<br/>\nout which ogre head is which in your bank box (though if the<br/>\nlatest no-drop quest item changes stick, this will be moot<br/>\nsince you&#39;re only going to be doing one quest at a time).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms.

Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>\ntheir use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>\nstacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>\nwith each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>\nElemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>\nmagic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>\nEndure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>\nmagic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>\nEndure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>\n29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
