The spells come fast...we got 10 in about 6 hours one night.  This is the cavern with 4 crystaline shardwurms, and the matriarch spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that want to know, this is a list of spells I&#39;ve seen drop: Melody of Ervaj, Impr. IVU (6 of these....grrrr), GD portal, Spirit Quickening, Monster Summoning 2, Shroud of Pain, Impr.
