Forage is a really difficult one to <br/>\n&gt; raise since it recycles so seldom and fails a lot. Keep trying, it&#39;ll go <br/>\n&gt; up. As far as other caps - I&#39;m sneaking about at 60 or so (and rising) at <br/>\n&gt; 23rd, so that&#39;s not capped at 40 for sure. Seriously doubt other skills are <br/>\n&gt; capped, wouldn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid they are. And yes, for some of them, it makes very little<br/>\nsense. At least to me, it makes very little sense as far as &quot;game play&quot;<br/>\ngoes. Forage caps at bad (unless you are a wood elf, in which case your<br/>\nbuilt in racial skill is higher than the bard&#39;s skill ever gets). It<br/>\nwont go past that no matter how much you practice and if you try to<br/>\ntrain it at your guild you get a message that you have reached your<br/>\nlimit for that skill (not the same message as when you try to train past<br/>\n20 in smithing for instance) Other skills such as hide also cap at very<br/>\nlow values.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont mind that some of our skills are capped at relatively low values,<br/>\nlike safe fall, because at least a low value of safe fall still works<br/>\nwith smaller falls, so sailing over the dunes of Ro is a little less<br/>\ndangerous at full bard speed, though by the time you get it, the amount<br/>\nof damage you would take from the falls it saves you from is pretty<br/>\nnegligible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in the case of forage and hide, I don&#39;t understand why they<br/>\neven gave us them with such low caps. With forage, you&#39;d have to keep a<br/>\nhot key in one of your main quick key pages and be mashing it every time<br/>\nit came up again to have a hope of getting enough food to make the<br/>\nbutton mashing worthwhile. Hide is likewise a waste of time because the<br/>\nonly way to even know if it succeeded is to ask someone else in your<br/>\nparty if you disappeared, because you always disappear on your own<br/>\nscreen. I tried one day to hide with my skill maxed and gave up after my<br/>\ncompanions started to get tired of me asking for the 15&#39;th time &quot;have I<br/>\ndisappeared yet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I&#39;ve found these to skills to do is provide ammunition for people to<br/>\nclaim the bard is over powered because we get all these skills from<br/>\nother classes that we shouldn&#39;t. Skills I&#39;ve found that I&#39;d rather not<br/>\nhave than have people point to as reasons why we are too powerful<br/>\ninclude hide, sneak, forage and instill doubt. Of the 3 rogue skills in<br/>\nthis list, the only one even the Rogues I know find useful is hide and<br/>\nthe they only use that to go afk for a bit (or that one in a million<br/>\ntime they use a Cazic potion)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
