Ok, switch to the flute.  Still resisted about half the<br/>\ntime, stunned about 6 times, no effect about 3 times.  Wow,<br/>\nmaybe there&#39;s something to this theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Then I unequipped the flute again.  Resisted about half<br/>\nthe time, stunned 11 times, no effect 2 times.  Ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other thing I can think of is that I think I had<br/>\nweapons equipped the first time, and my MM drum equiped the<br/>\nthird time.  GZ mentioned something about some instruments<br/>\nbeing focus objects.  Maybe the MM drum has that effect.  I<br/>\nwill have to test it some more with the log on so I can get<br/>\nexact counts.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
