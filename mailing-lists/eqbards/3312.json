This is all before I&#39;ve picked up<br/>\nany loot.  With banded, I&#39;d usually see myself dodge once or<br/>\ntwice in a fight.  Now that I think about it, the last time I<br/>\nremember seeing myself dodge was over a week ago(!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBear in mind that our experience is relative.  I didn&#39;t start<br/>\nwearing plate until I had three pieces (breastplate, greaves,<br/>\npauldron) because I was vain and didn&#39;t like the way bronze<br/>\nchest and banded leggings looked.  :-)  So I went from mostly<br/>\nbanded to mostly plate rather quickly.  If you went piece by<br/>\npiece like most people seem to do, you may not have noticed.<br/>\nIf you got plate early (so your AC was high enough that mobs<br/>\nwere just hitting for less because it was way beyond their<br/>\n&quot;level&quot; range), you may not have noticed either figuring the<br/>\nextra damage was just due to the mobs being tougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try getting a full suit of mesh from Guk and playing with<br/>\nthat and report back in a week or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
