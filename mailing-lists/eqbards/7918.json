You&#39;re arguing personal<br/>\nopinion and nothing more.  In my experience, it&#39;s difficult, if not<br/>\nimpossible, to change someone&#39;s attitude towards something.  That is<br/>\nsomething they have to do themselves.  If you don&#39;t mind twinking - twink.<br/>\nIf you do mind twinking - don&#39;t twink (and don&#39;t support twinkers and<br/>\ntwinkees).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no one takes offense to this, &#39;cause it&#39;s not intended to be<br/>\noffensive.  I&#39;m definitely not saying one way is correct and the other is<br/>\nwrong.  That is for you to decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in my ** PERSONAL OPINION **, twinking does detract from the game,<br/>\nin the fact that it strips the character of having to strive for better<br/>\nequipment... and half the fun of these games is obtaining new toys and<br/>\nwatching your character move up through the ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar) - who is really bored at work.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 3:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBut are you really making their life easier by twinking them?  Are you<br/>\nreally enhancing the playing experience?  I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>\nfollowing equipment before they reached 2nd level: Full Leather Armor, many<br/>\nsnakeskin pieces including tunic, Bloodforge hammer, 2 cutthroat rings, at<br/>\nleast 50 plat.  Now whats next for her?  When she thinks about the &quot;next<br/>\ncool item&quot; she wants to get her hands on.  She is thinking about items that<br/>\nare WAY over her head.  She is now 13th level, and she still hasent out<br/>\ngrown any of her equipment.  And now after 13 levels she is realizing that<br/>\nit is very difficult to get stuff.  13 levels and she haddent gained the<br/>\nrespect for items that you get over time.  It is sad.  She is bored, and<br/>\nfeeling useless.  Actually I have talked her into creating a bard :) and she<br/>\nis building up from scratch with no twinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk Im not talking about giving a tarnished weapon to a 1st level char.  No<br/>\nIm talking about giving someone somthing that they will be stuck with for a<br/>\nvery very long time.  Change is good.  And on top of this.  My poor Druid<br/>\nfriend, has been using a 2 handed blunt bloodforge for 13 levels, never<br/>\nswitching weapons.  Now she is stuck, and worried about switching to a<br/>\nweapon she has never used.  Wow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont get it.  Perhaps im a little jaded because I have been looking for a<br/>\nBronze Breastplate for the last 2 weeks with no luck.. But I dont think its<br/>\nall that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet &lt;Mischief&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel of Bristlebane<br/>\n22nd Human Bard<br/>\non Brell Serelis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Miriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 1:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 5 Oct 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; not have friends who offer.
