Did Icy orcs for a while which was okay but<br/>\nstaying there for 4 levels is not something I could endure boredom-wise.  If<br/>\nI could do a different one of these camps every week I might be okay but<br/>\nHighKeep has been full the last three times I was there over the past month<br/>\nas was the KFC drive-thru.  I&#39;ve done some Perma in the Preacher room.<br/>\nMaybe I should head over o Cazic and see what we can handle.  Last time I<br/>\nwas there it was packed but now that rubi is gone it may be viable.  If I<br/>\nhad a more reliable group it would be better at least I could spend time<br/>\nyakking, but they don&#39;t have much of a regular schedule as they are mostly<br/>\nplayers like me at 3-4 times a week.  The days of the week they do varies<br/>\ntoo much, but every group I&#39;ve tried to join that was around a lot was<br/>\naround every nite so they quickly zoomed past me.  There are just way too<br/>\nmany really bad players out there for pickup groups as a bard.  Every bad<br/>\npickup group I&#39;ve been in I&#39;ve been the first casualty due to the prevalence<br/>\nof bard &#39;dislike&#39;.  Since most bad groups seem to have even less ability to<br/>\nsufficiently anger a mob due to their incompetence than good players do, the<br/>\nbard insta-target thing has really bitten me often sonce I made 18th or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 12:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n20-25 - rough stage for someone who wont camp and dont like crowded zones<br/>\n(because that just about describes everywhere on our server.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHighKeep - Lookout room and guard room.  But I think that&#39;s camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karana - KFC crowded but then you have the &quot;Hill of Doom&quot; Head over<br/>\ntowards the Hermit (camp him if he&#39;s not taken - opps you dont camp - sorry)<br/>\nand park on top of one of those hills - kinda between Herman and KFC.  Have<br/>\nyour ranger track and pull back to the party on the hill. Opps camping<br/>\nagain?<br/>\n<br/>\nCazic-Thule - more trains and crowded but try the sewers - go down from the<br/>\ndoors above the double doors where you zone in from and explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOOT - is there a skelly island where you clear thru skellys to get to some<br/>\ngargoyles?<br/>\n<br/>\nUpper Guk - opps that&#39;s a hard dungeon if you dont have a good group who can<br/>\nhandle things like crowd control and runner stoppage.  Also, takes some<br/>\nexploring to find the good spots and you&#39;d prolly need to invis in, find a<br/>\nspot (like way back by ancient croc) and invis out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreants, druids - welcome to the dark side! (I was gonna add bards too but<br/>\nremembered what list this was going to &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nPermafrost - hard dungeon but has stuff. Key to some of these hard places<br/>\nmight be 2 groups willing to work together.  But you (not you personally but<br/>\ngenerically young 20&#39;s) are lo to mid 20&#39;s and still trying to learn to<br/>\nassist the main tank or assist the pet.  Also maybe the Redking (sp?) the<br/>\nplatform in Everfrost where the Icy Orcs are? Camped? Opps!  that bad word<br/>\nagain!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas - but one thing you may need to come to terms with is this<br/>\ngame has _alot_ of campers and camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 12:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>\n&gt; deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>\nfrequently<br/>\n&gt; to make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; there were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>\n&gt; groups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>\n&gt; difficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>\n&gt; skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to<br/>\nS<br/>\n&gt; Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
