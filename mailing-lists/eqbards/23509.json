We haven&#39;t really had any hard and fast rules up to<br/>\nthis point, haven&#39;t needed them since 90% of us know one another in RL as<br/>\nwell.  I have noticed though that some people once they get something tend<br/>\nto become ever more greedy than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is, while I am an officer in the guild, so is the offending<br/>\nparty.  Maybe I just need a new guild with more structure or maybe all<br/>\nguilds suffer this to some degree.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking uber loot<br/>\nhere.  The weapon in one instance was about the same as the one he was<br/>\nusing, though cooler looking perhaps.  It would have been a considerable<br/>\nupgrade for one of the members who was building up a second character,<br/>\nmostly due to guild needs however.  Had he offered to sell it within guild<br/>\none of the parties would surely have bought it, although probably being a<br/>\nbit irritated<br/>\nin the process considering the only reason they didn&#39;t get it the first time<br/>\nwas because he said he wanted to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: RKR [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 2:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Eldrig the Old<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how I would handle it in my guild: this person would no longer be a<br/>\nmember.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a 3 strike policy, meaning that you get two warnings and when the<br/>\nthird<br/>\nproblem is confirmed, you&#39;re out.
