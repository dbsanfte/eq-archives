At least that&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; impression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>\n&gt; other class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>\n&gt; spells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>\n&gt; the necros presented their case in an adult manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you look at the new Necro spellls, they all make the necro more group<br/>\nfriendly.  I think it&#39;s entirely possible that these ideas and changes have<br/>\nbeen in the works for awhile now.  The pet changes came rather fast.. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think they really had the time to make all these spells changes in<br/>\nthat short of a span.  Look how long it is taking to get our missing songs.<br/>\n:)  I think in most cases, Verant does things that are on THEIR agenda, not<br/>\nbased on the whiney posts.  Sometimes the two coincide...<br/>\n<br/>\nBad Verant! for the positive reinforcement!<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
