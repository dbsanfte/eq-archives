Maybe save 5 for something else if<br/>\nyou like, but strength is VERY VERY important for a bard if you ever intend<br/>\nto wear more than leather armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a short run down on what the various stats have to offer a bard:<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength - How hard you hit, though exactly how this is factored in appears<br/>\nto be hard to determine.  The big thing is that strength determines how much<br/>\nyou can carry, and this matters a great deal when you want to wear armour<br/>\nlater on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDexterity - A very important stat for a bard. Appears to affect how often<br/>\nyou miss notes.  Some say that is really determined by...<br/>\n<br/>\nCharisma - Which affects prices offered you by NPCs and other NPC<br/>\nreactions.  Also probably has an undertermined effect on songs, particularly<br/>\nmesmerizing and charming songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther attributes you might care about:<br/>\n<br/>\nAgility - Affects your chance to dodge.  Used to affect your AC, but doesn&#39;t<br/>\nappear to now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWisdom - Probably the least important for a bard, but it does play into your<br/>\nresistances to magic and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntelligence - Effects how quickly you learn things, which doesn&#39;t matter<br/>\nmuch to a bard unless you want to be a smith on the side, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
