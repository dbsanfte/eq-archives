I have been dumping training points into Bind Wound<br/>\nsince the start and am really happy I did. At 60 or so it heals up to 15<br/>\nover (I think) 3 ticks and really makes the first half of bad hurtin heal<br/>\nquickly. When the fight ends I start Hymn, arm the mandolin, and start<br/>\nbandaging. As the standing penalty is only 2/tick it&#39;s a pretty good<br/>\ntradeoff. Also, a small oddity, while Hymn won&#39;t work, it turns out you can<br/>\nbandage PvP+ players.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
