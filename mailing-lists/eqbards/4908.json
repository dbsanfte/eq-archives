I have one of my own<br/>\n     <br/>\n     1.  Since Verant rants about how this game is designed for parting  <br/>\n     they need to improve the desirability of haveing a bard in a party.  <br/>\n     Now that I have learned about the enchanter speed spell line I now <br/>\n     understand why it is sometimes very difficult to find a party that <br/>\n     wants a bard when you go to a new zone where your not known.  I <br/>\n     personally felt that the attack speed buff we provided from anthem, <br/>\n     celerity etc should be one of our main attractions.  Since the <br/>\n     enchanter buffs are better this is no longer the case.  (  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     SO... replace one the of late teens/early twenties songs with a toned <br/>\n     downed version of the 32 level mana song.  Maybe half as effective as <br/>\n     the 32 level song.  This would definitely solve the, what good are <br/>\n     bards for, problem between about 15th and 32 level.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold<br/>\n     19th level<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard Petition<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-JudsonSapp (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JudsonSapp@...\">JudsonSapp@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    8/4/99 9:32 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Judson Sapp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JudsonSapp@...\">JudsonSapp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nI read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I for one do not <br/>\nlike petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be the way to get <br/>\nthings fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer of the Bard <br/>\npetition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some people to make new <br/>\ncomments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The ball is in our <br/>\ncourt so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on things we would like <br/>\nto have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>\n     <br/>\nOn a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, and believe it <br/>\nor not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained a lot more <br/>\nabout there class.  I have to say though that my Mage character was a lot <br/>\nmore balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the Mages out by <br/>\nfixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>\n     <br/>\nSuggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few ideas to get <br/>\nthe ball rolling.<br/>\n     <br/>\n1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is <br/>\nchange the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats <br/>\nmight be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem. <br/>\nI have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be <br/>\nno debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>\n2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>\n3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand <br/>\npoint it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a <br/>\ncoin.<br/>\n5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a <br/>\ncrossbow or bow?<br/>\n6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be <br/>\nused as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of <br/>\nsinging songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas <br/>\nhere would help.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\nI hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a constructive way to <br/>\nhelp solve some bard issues.<br/>\n     <br/>\nFair thee well friends!<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\nIf you join ONElist s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
