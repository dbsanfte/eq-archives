I&#39;ve found EQ<br/>\nextremely addictive as well so keep the info flowing.  My character isn&#39;t<br/>\npower hungry or camp hungry like many of the players I&#39;ve seen lately.  I&#39;m<br/>\nmuch more into the part of being a bard and enjoying the fantasty world.  I<br/>\ndetest the idea of hanging out waiting for things to respawn for you to kill<br/>\nand then wait to kill again.  I really think EQ needs a rogue band of camp<br/>\nkillers to go around and whack on people if they&#39;ve been sitting there for<br/>\ntoo long.  I do think we bards get left out sometimes though.  I think we<br/>\nneed to have a concert or something, maybe a Bard-alapooza or show.  Gather<br/>\nthe bards together and sing baby sing!<br/>\n<br/>\nGediprime, of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 1999 12:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Spoilers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 12:52 PM 6/18/99 -0400, John Robertson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Spoilers below... though not many.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is good that those supplying information some will consider spoilers<br/>\n&gt; should give such warning.

In my mind and on an in-game<br/>\n&gt; basis, this forum represents a conclave of bards, helping one another.<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; a dedicated roleplayer, trying to keep the fantasy intact as much as I can<br/>\n&gt; and avoiding fantasy-busters such as /loc or talking too much in terms of<br/>\n&gt; software mechanisms, but I&#39;m sure in an alternate reality like our game<br/>\n&gt; world bards would share tales and information, suggesting good places to<br/>\n&gt; see, profitable ventures, and particularly effective techniques and<br/>\nequipment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some want to discover it all for themselves.  Some want the most power the<br/>\n&gt; fastest.  Some want to live a fantasy life.  I want to have fun and avoid<br/>\n&gt; major frustration and I find this forum a wonderful resouce to those ends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep the information flowing.
