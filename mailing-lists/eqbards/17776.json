Program<br/>\na social to the referee so you send him/her a tell and<br/>\nthey know you aren&#39;t leaving the zone.  I say a button<br/>\nbecause you may be busy as you run...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easier to ask forgiveness than to get<br/>\npermission ... especially when playing a widely <br/>\nmisunderstood class;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah...this magican starts the duel WITHOUT the pet<br/>\nand summon after the fight begins...pretty much the<br/>\nconvention but your opponent may try to argue<br/>\notherwise.  Pets are somewhat variable in level and<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want him showing up with something that cons<br/>\nyellow to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nbest of luck...<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lisa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lilyanatwin@...\">Lilyanatwin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m getting some great ideas guys!

I will<br/>\n&gt; have to check to make sure<br/>\n&gt; I can leave the board, that would be soooo funny!<br/>\n&gt; Everyone would be like where<br/>\n&gt; did she go?

A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 15th lvl pet will kill them in no time but they<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep the pet occupied long enough for you to go<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and melee the mage a bit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ...and borrow a thulian claw or something really<br/>\n&gt; fast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the genius who matched you up with a con-red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opponent. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also work overtime to make 12th lvl, which you<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easily do at the chessboard, but a quick place is<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Derv Camp in West Commons...you might even make 13<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then.  You are still at a disadvantage but at<br/>\n&gt; least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you would have bellow as an extra tool.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pet roots you...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the pet roots you and you are singing Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can usually break root the next round...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; good luck...even if you don&#39;t win, make sure your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opponent knows he was in a fight!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Send online invitations with Yahoo!
