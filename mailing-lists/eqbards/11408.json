Given the number of hit points a 29 bard has - and the<br/>\nlava doing damage in 56 increments - I realized I had a good amount of<br/>\ntime - and tried to climb out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I didn&#39;t realize this wasn&#39;t possible - and got myself in deep (nice pun<br/>\nthere &lt;g&gt;).  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; (waterfall type thingy) that you can&#39;t<br/>\nclimb out.  Right past there is a zone to Sol-B.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My situation was that my Druid helper died because our levitations wore<br/>\noff.  Being the selfless type - he renewed mine before his - and<br/>\nsubsequently died when his fizzled.  I figured I could &quot;safely&quot; zone to B<br/>\nbecause I had a freshly renewed Levitate and would have plenty of time to<br/>\nzone back if I had no better luck getting our of the lava in B.<br/>\n<br/>\n    When I got to B - I can&#39;t remember exactly the layout (first time I was<br/>\nthere anyhow) but there&#39;s like a big cavernous area - so with levitate it<br/>\nwas pretty easy to get to solid ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As far as your question - the zone from Sol-B to Sol-A is already lava -<br/>\nso you&#39;d already have to have fell into lava in Sol-B to zone through Lava<br/>\nto Sol-A...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 10:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Lava & Corpses was Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into<br/>\nSol-b?<br/>\n&gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in<br/>\nLava<br/>\n&gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?
