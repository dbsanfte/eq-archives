Plats are very easy to get even after level 20. I<br/>\n&gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and almost always over<br/>\n&gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will have up to 1000 to<br/>\n&gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats a pain is getting<br/>\n&gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. This is why I<br/>\n&gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for awesome items I or my<br/>\n&gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
