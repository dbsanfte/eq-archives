(I apologize <br/>\n     if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most <br/>\n     interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must <br/>\n     say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.  <br/>\n     (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>\n     <br/>\n     1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area <br/>\n     effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step <br/>\n     by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group <br/>\n     of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>\n     <br/>\n     2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the <br/>\n     Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal <br/>\n     population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing <br/>\n     Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.<br/>\n     I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some <br/>\n     experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter <br/>\n     (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am <br/>\n     rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a <br/>\n     goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Thanks in advance,<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold (Xegony) (look no e.. :))</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
