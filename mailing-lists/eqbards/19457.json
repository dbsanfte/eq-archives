Until the<br/>\nearlier message today about chains not stopping runners in their tracks at<br/>\nlow health I was always under the impression this song worked fully as<br/>\nintended.  The only reason I can think of that for it to be in testing is<br/>\nthat it wears off prematurely sometimes.  Example: I&#39;ve been using<br/>\nchains/fear combo a lot the last few times I&#39;ve played.  I weave the two<br/>\nwith Celerity.  On numerous occasions the following has happened:  1)<br/>\ninitial chains wears off (yellow text message), 2) restart chains and get<br/>\nthe blue text message it sticks, 3) immediately get yellow text message<br/>\nsaying chains has wore off again.  So either one of two things is happening:<br/>\n1) Mobs are getting a second chance to break the chains earlier than its<br/>\nnormal duration (by design?) or 2) chains doesn&#39;t always stick even if you<br/>\nget a success message (bug).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else I&#39;ve noticed that may be a bug.  Sometimes after I chain the<br/>\nmob they will resist my first Screech attempt.  I then restart screech and<br/>\nif it sticks skip celerity and go straight to another Chains.  On a few<br/>\noccasions I will get the blue message that the mob is chained before I get<br/>\nthe yellow message that the initial chains has wore off.  But when I do get<br/>\nthe message that the first chains has wore off, the mob starts to run away<br/>\nagain at full speed.  So in effect since the second chains didn&#39;t stick even<br/>\nthough I got the message it did.  This has only happened on a few occasions<br/>\nso I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time.  I only remembered it when I<br/>\nsaw the message that they were testing Chains for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts been a real long time since we&#39;ve had to discuss Chains on this list so<br/>\nif these have already been discussed then I&#39;ve forgotten about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 12:40 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard song fixes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, my last post didn&#39;t seem to go through, so here it is again...<br/>\n<br/>\nWoo HOo...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the sony boards<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
