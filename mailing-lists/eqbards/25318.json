Normally you want the fastest weapon in the main hand to take advantage of the primary hand damage bonus, but in this case I believe the better ratio of the mace will make it superior to the saber.  If I were you, tho, I&#39;d use the Partisan in main and the Mace in offhand... I believe that&#39;ll give you a higher damage output overall (19 Delay fast weapon in primary and great ratio weapon in secondary).  Reserve the Saber for situations where you don&#39;t want aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to verify my recommendations on Copelands just to be sure, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a proc message, but for the life of me I can&#39;t remember what it is atm.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the following:<br/>\n  Guardians Mace 1HB 14/24 Proc: Guard (24 or so Cleric AC Buff)<br/>\n  Symphonic Saber 1HS 11/23 CHA+10 Int+5 Symphonic Harmony<br/>\n<br/>\n  Which should go in the primary and which in secondary?  The Mace has a<br/>\n  better Ratio - but I thought someone posted faster weap should be in<br/>\n  primary.  Also - the mace procs CONSTANTLY.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyone know if there&#39;s a message for the proc on the Saber?  I just got it<br/>\n  and haven&#39;t been able to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lastly - I was previously using the Guardians in primary and a Sioniches<br/>\n  Partisan (Piercing 9/19 Cha+6 Int+2 Sv Magic+5) in my offhand - and don&#39;t<br/>\n  see any reason to hang on to it.  Any Xegony guys know what&#39;s worth and<br/>\n  anyone who may want to buy it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Slyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n  56 Bard Xegony<br/>\n  Officer, Dragons of Kel`Dar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
