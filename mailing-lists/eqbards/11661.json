What they should have (and should do still) is<br/>\nput in a Bar/Trl/Ogr item that has unlimited charges of shrink...something like<br/>\n&quot;Moggok&#39;s bracer of not being a big fata**&quot; or some such nonsense.  The Guise<br/>\nwas intended to be Brd/Rog only.  They should also put in an ultravision item<br/>\nfor da hummies.  (there is already an Infravision ring, right?)  I understand<br/>\nthe need  for the large races to be shrunk (been trapped in guk etc.) and i<br/>\nunderstand that higher lvl humans should have some way to compensate for their<br/>\ndeficiencies.  I know that alot of people think &quot;Well, that&#39;s the racial<br/>\ndisadvantage&quot; which i partially agree with.  I do think that with work and<br/>\nperserverence (read as &quot;Levels and Camping&quot;) they should be able to overcome<br/>\nthese disadvantages thru items.  But, it has bothered me since day one of<br/>\nrelease that the guise was a bard/rogue only item that wasn&#39;t really.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Puts both feet firmly on soapbox&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, i also think that if the Manastone is &quot;too Powerful&quot; it should be<br/>\nremoved entirely (maybe turn it into a diamond so that the people who camped<br/>\nfor it get some ROI)  <br/>\nWhile i&#39;m at it...JBoots should have to be worn to be used IMSO.  I realize<br/>\nthat they are all/all, but if u wanna run fast, you should have to suffer the 0<br/>\nAC detriment.  It seems obvious to me that was their intent initially.<br/>\n...and maybe u should have to have your squad ring in the finger slot to use<br/>\nthe charge of heal....did i miss anything? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving the old items on the people that already had it stratifies the EQ<br/>\npopulation...Punishing those who did not start early, or were not lucky enough<br/>\nto acquire the items before they were removed.  In the case of the Manastone,<br/>\nit makes casters (specifically clerics and druids) that have them better than<br/>\nthose that don&#39;t, and with the manastone gone, the casters that don&#39;t have it<br/>\nwill always be &quot;inferior&quot; to those that do.  I realize this is kind of vague,<br/>\nbut this message is really long already....<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd song<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>\nadultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>\n-- Jon Stewart<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
