Wait for<br/>\ncharm to expire and recharm your pet.  Click on the target monster and hit<br/>\nthe pet attack key several times.  They should start fighting.  Fire up<br/>\nSelos and retarget your pet (hit F1 twice).  Try to fire up charm a bit<br/>\nbefore its going to expire, you cant renew charm, but its nice to have it in<br/>\nmid cast when it expires.  Do this while running in circles.  When charm<br/>\nresticks the monster should resume fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes and variations:<br/>\nI use Hymm as my ??? song as you will get hit occasionally.  You could use<br/>\nBinding and try to insure that your pet wins the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nCyclops are REALLY good pets as they hit hard and automatically return to<br/>\ntheir former target when they are re charmed.  Not all monsters do this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
