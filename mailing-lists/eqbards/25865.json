Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how did I (and other women) get interested in EQ if the marketting is<br/>\nall geared toward men?  Desire to *be* Firiona?  No way.  Everyone&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent, but I can&#39;t imagine most women would be drawn to her.   Think<br/>\nabout the covers of the four boxes.  On three of them, Firiona&#39;s not even<br/>\ndoing anything.  If she were in my group I&#39;d say &quot;Quit standing around,<br/>\n[explative],  and come help us!  We&#39;ve got a battle going on here!&quot;  The<br/>\none cover she&#39;s not just standing around on she&#39;s chained up.  Great!  Just<br/>\nthe person I&#39;d want to play with!  Doesn&#39;t help the group at all and then<br/>\ngoes and gets herself into trouble and needs to be rescued.  Gah!  Leave to<br/>\nthe lizard!<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, that bard on the first box wasn&#39;t much better.  She was probably<br/>\nsinging, yes, but empty handed?  Play or fight, sister!<br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I starting to need a life more than David Kennerly?<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvulia,<br/>\na bubble from a surname,<br/>\nTunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                                                         <br/>\n                   &quot;Talies the                                                                           <br/>\n                   Wanderer&quot;            To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>                                  <br/>\n                   &lt;snicker@pink        cc:                                                              <br/>\n                   pig.com&gt;             Subject:     Re: [eqbards] [OT] Fascinating Article              <br/>\n                                                                                                         <br/>\n                   02/15/2002                                                                            <br/>\n                   09:58 AM                                                                              <br/>\n                   Please                                                                                <br/>\n                   respond to                                                                            <br/>\n                   eqbards                                                                               <br/>\n                                                                                                         <br/>\n                                                                                                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:53 AM 2/15/2002 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It funny, but I was just reading a statistical analysis of the EQ player<br/>\n&gt;base and it claimed female players enjoy EQ more than male players.<br/>\n&gt;Something to do with women exploiting the social aspects of the game where<br/>\n&gt;men just powerlevel and get phat lewtz.
