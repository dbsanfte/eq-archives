It all<br/>\ndepends on playstyle.  I know tanks, and play a tank, that never stops<br/>\npunching buttons for more than 2 seconds at a time (which means I&#39;m pushing<br/>\nat least as many, if not more, buttons than my bard)  My bard is far more<br/>\nINTENSE action because I have to keep everything timed while doing it.

I didn&#39;t say primary tank.  Rangers are NOT<br/>\n&gt; primary tanks.  Rangers are 2ndary and as such they should ALWAYS watch<br/>\n&gt; EVERYONE (including the bard) because they&#39;re the next best tank in the<br/>\n&gt; group (unless there is an SK or Pally)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snare isn&#39;t quite as easy as you think unless you just don&#39;t bother<br/>\nsnaring<br/>\n&gt; every critter.  Its not easy to pop-target 6 mobs to make sure they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; snared then get back on the right one.  Trust me there is a LOT of button<br/>\n&gt; pushing if you&#39;re a GOOD ranger, just like there is if you&#39;re a GOOD bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me and the bard I run with (when I&#39;m not playing my bard) have a blast.  I<br/>\n&gt; pop-snare an entire room while they beat on me and he sings Largo&#39;s then<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; AE fear&#39;s while AE dotting I beat up one at a time and we rake in XP hand<br/>\n&gt; over fist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but obviously you have a different style<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; your warrior than I do with my ranger.  As a Ranger I see it as my job to<br/>\n&gt; make sure every un-engaged mob stays OFF every other party member and is<br/>\n&gt; either rooted, snared or otherwise occupied so that the casters can do<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; jobs without being killed (and a bard, in this case, is considred a caster<br/>\n&gt; by me).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bottom line:<br/>\n&gt; Bards have to time their button presses, others don&#39;t.  That does not mean<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; bard is pushing more buttons.  And if your bard is pounding Sense heading<br/>\n&gt; during combat then he&#39;s a fool.  The ranger CAN do it without reducing his<br/>\n&gt; overall effectiveness, so he does.  In fact I&#39;ll sometimes even pop<br/>\ntracking<br/>\n&gt; just to see what&#39;s around.  A bard can&#39;t do that while trying to twist 3<br/>\n&gt; songs because of timing.  Does that mean a bard is hitting more buttons?<br/>\n&gt; Nope, just means they have to time their button presses.  I don&#39;t so I<br/>\ntend<br/>\n&gt; to pound buttons non-stop as a ranger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matter of fact, I would say that when playing my ranger my fingers never<br/>\n&gt; stop moving unless we&#39;re resting between fights.   Even then I&#39;m hitting<br/>\n&gt; track now and then to see if a named has popped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Big Daddy Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] getting new friends<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sense Heading:  That goes for any character, not just rangers...<br/>\nPerhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard have a slightly higher int which would help a small amount.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Make sure you have the correct target?
