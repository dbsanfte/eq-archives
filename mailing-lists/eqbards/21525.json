Though no one sat down and said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to make creatures flee more&quot;, that&#39;s the result.<br/>\nWithout going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to <br/>\nflee, there are several &quot;components&quot; that NPCs use to determine how brave <br/>\nthey are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the <br/>\ninterrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other <br/>\nless-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space <br/>\nallocated to a variable that hasn&#39;t yet been &#39;set&#39; to anything, and usually <br/>\ncontains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than <br/>\nthey should have been.<br/>\nWe are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial <br/>\nimpression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how <br/>\nthings are turning out so far.<br/>\nWhat are your thoughts?<br/>\n- Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:26 AM 9/22/00 -0600, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did anyone else note a change in the fleeing over the last couple of nights<br/>\n&gt;since the patch?
