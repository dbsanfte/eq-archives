I<br/>\npicked up two shields while killing only 3 trainers, and as everyone knows,<br/>\nDvinn always has the dirk.  In fact, I saw people selling them for 30pp<br/>\nwhich is an amazingly low price for a weapon of that quality.  In fact,<br/>\nthough my piercing is currently at 0, the weapon is so good, I&#39;m going to<br/>\ndrop some of my many saved training points in piercing and switch weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaena of the Amber Order<br/>\n15th Lvl Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
