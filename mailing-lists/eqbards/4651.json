People who play bards may be travelers, too,<br/>\nright?  So this is bard related.  Right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking into buying a laptop and obviously it has to run EverQuest<br/>\nreasonably well.  Does anyone have experience with laptops and EverQuest,<br/>\nor state-of-the-art games in general?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only experience I have so far is disappointment with the high-end<br/>\nToshiba provided for my job.  It has the one chipset EverQuest doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsupport and when running in any graphic mode below 1024x768 it simply<br/>\nreduces the size of what&#39;s displayed leaving a black border.  Is it<br/>\npossible for an LCD not to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
