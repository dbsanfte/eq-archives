We are having an event on my server,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the chessboard with<br/>\n&gt; duels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of King, Queen,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my guild has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I would be asked<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been chosen as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ to possibly<br/>\n&gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to some of the<br/>\n&gt; rules of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. I do know<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allowed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best bard that I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of you......the experts!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Melodii (Bard of 11 seasons)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Free E-Cards, Screensavers, and Digital Pictures!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Corbis.com:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
