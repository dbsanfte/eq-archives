Up until this point, when I want to buff resist rates<br/>\nbecause my group is fighting a caster, I have always chosen to sing a Rhythm<br/>\nbased song with drums instead of the Psalms.  From my experience, caster<br/>\nmobs seem to have a restricted spell book, casting no more than 3 or 4<br/>\ndifferent spells in any combat.  Of the 3-4 spells they will cast, it seems<br/>\nthat only two different spell realms will be used, i.e. either magic based<br/>\nor one of the other areas (i.e. fire/cold/disease/poison).  IMO, it seems<br/>\nsafer to hedge your bets and boost resist rates in three realms with the<br/>\nrhythm series versus only one with the Psalm series.  Will that 6 point<br/>\ndifference (Psalm @ 51- Rhythm w/drum @ 45) really make that much of a<br/>\ndifference?  It would if the mob only casted spells from one realm but how<br/>\noften does that happen?  This scenario assumes you don&#39;t have to tank the<br/>\nmobs and can equip a drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a tank by default and have to equip your weapons, IMO you still<br/>\ncome out better singing a rhythm song instead of a Psalm.  You will increase<br/>\nresist rates by a total of 75 (25 in each realm).  Since mob casters tend to<br/>\nonly use two realms of magic, you only get to use 50 of the extra resist<br/>\npoints but that is still on par with what the Psalm will give you (51).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I use a Psalm is to get the damage shield when we are fighting<br/>\na melee mob. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs my rationale on song selection on track or am I missing out on something?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; With the resistance cycles complete in my repertoire, I decided it was<br/>\n&gt; time to write down a few numbers.
