Our animation guy could either A)<br/>\nremove the bard surfing animation from Selo&#39;s or B) Give us a drum. <br/>\nMost people like the surfing or at worst didn&#39;t care about it, almost<br/>\neveryone I know thinks the drum animation is awful.  SO they fix the<br/>\nsurfing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have made countless patches trying to keep necro&#39;s and druids from<br/>\nbeing able to solo too effectivly.  I have no problem with this, since<br/>\nthey are pretty hell bent of forcing people to group.  HOWEVER, how<br/>\nabout spending a fraction of that time giving zoning players a 5 second<br/>\ninvul so you wouldn&#39;t die before your computer gave you a chance to<br/>\nrespond.  You can bet if there was a bug where players got 5-10 seconds<br/>\nof free attack time on a monster, they would fix that...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took them 8 or so months to implement things which were supposed to<br/>\nbe in the original game.  Poison, alchemy, some of our songs.  I won&#39;t<br/>\neven get into the 5 continents which the game advertises.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA second major complaint set comes from supposed fixes which go into the<br/>\ngame, obviously untested.  The levitation thing was a clear example of<br/>\nthis, there was no way they tested that &quot;fix&quot; before putting it live,<br/>\nsince the bard bug was so obvious...<br/>\n<br/>\nCOmplaint set #3: overcrowding.  When the game was released, they<br/>\nassured us they would keep opening servers to keep 1500 people per<br/>\nserver at peak times.  I can&#39;t remeber the last time I got to play (I<br/>\nwork 9-5 job, so I play evenings and weekends, peak times) on Veeshan<br/>\nwhen there were less than 1500 people on,  And Veeshan is not at the top<br/>\nof list for crowding.  This is inexcusable on their part, and will be<br/>\nthe death of the game when someone finally manages to write a<br/>\ncompetitive product. (Anyone want to join me and try?)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
