I turned down 3-4 at 40 and one at 30.  Then a friend told<br/>\nme it was no longer appearing at every death of the despicable D&#39;Vinn.  So<br/>\nI figured I&#39;d have to go to at least 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning into Faydark from Butcherblock, where I&#39;d been to Kaladim with a<br/>\nload of Crushbone belts and Legionnaire pads, I auctioned my now familiar,<br/>\n&quot;Buying Dragoon Dirk.&quot;  Shortly I saw one auctioned with several unusual<br/>\nitems.  I responded immediately asking price.  The answer was 20 pp.  I<br/>\nimmediately responded &quot;Sold&quot; and asked where to meet the seller.  I<br/>\nfinished my cross-country shortcut to Kelethin and jumped on the path to<br/>\nFelwithe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere I met a gorgeous, statuesqe, attractively armored Barbarian woman<br/>\n(Erolissi herself in disguise?).  She sold me the Dirk and said she hoped<br/>\nit was helpful here.  I only just realized how she might have been taken<br/>\nfor Erolissi in mortal form, or I would have made the complement then.  Ah,<br/>\nwhat we think to say when it&#39;s too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I expect she was a tourist, in the big city from the far lands, and<br/>\nunaware of the present price for Dirks.  I salved my twinge of guilt with<br/>\nthe consideration that she may well have obtained it herself from D&#39;Vinn&#39;s<br/>\nproperly lifeless corpse, or may have bought it at a bargain price and been<br/>\nglad of her profit.  Or may have had little need for cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe it was Erolissi herself, come to bless her servant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
