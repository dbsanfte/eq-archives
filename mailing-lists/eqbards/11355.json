Four rubies at the best<br/>\n  faction/cha is 524 pp, btw.  Most enchanters I know will go with the:<br/>\n <br/>\n  I&#39;ll give you a plat bar and a star ruby, on a success I will<br/>\n  pay you for your efforts.  But then you take on the cost of<br/>\n  failures.  105pp for a plat bar, 68pp for a star ruby, that <br/>\n  gives you 5 attempts for the enchanter to be successful before<br/>\n  you could of just paid them 900-1000pp to do it.  With recent<br/>\n  changes to jewelcraft, I hear it&#39;s near impossible to create<br/>\n  mid-high level platinum items without certain failures.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  So if you get lucky, and the enchanter takes your stuff (173pp)<br/>\n  and succeeds first try how much do you pay them?  And what on<br/>\n  further attempts if they fail?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ooops, I forgot... Fozzle is a skill(200) jeweller too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He failed 6 times in a row on a plat ruby veil, ouch!<br/>\n  (131 + 105) * 6 , eeeek.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You will find 1k pp is very firm on Innoruuk.  You may get it<br/>\n  for 900pp or people may ask 1100pp.  Not sure what the going<br/>\n  price is.  I paid 1k for mine, many many months ago.  Unless<br/>\n  you have friends in high places, are good buddies with a <br/>\n  skill(200) enchanter, or find some extremely incredible deal<br/>\n  such as Steven - you will end up paying the piper.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
