I am _scared_ <br/>\n&gt; (Mara refrains from caps due to this newfound camaraderie).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s mostly a tease, although caps usually means emphasis,<br/>\n  people like to use it to shout at you, so to speak.  However,<br/>\n  I think strong sentance structure and thought flow can relay <br/>\n  the same desired emphasis effect.  Some things you can&#39;t help ;)  <br/>\n  IMO, YMMV, IIRC ... even EQ! hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t mean to single out any one person, but reading John&#39;s(tm)<br/>\n  e-mails is very relaxing to me, since his grammar and spelling<br/>\n  are excellent, his thoughts are very well organized, and he makes<br/>\n  a huge impact without &#39;quoting&#39; or CAPPING.  I aspire to be more<br/>\n  like you John(tm)  /end shameless plug<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Telling people not to caps strong words is like telling someone:<br/>\n  &#39;Hey you cannot come into the hateplane, we are here now.&#39;  /laugh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And the agreement around my place is: no complaining!  I did it to myself!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  lol!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey, I really lucked out on an imbrued bracer drop from a cube in Fear <br/>\n&gt; the other night.  I get these frantic tells from my group:  &quot;Quick!  Get<br/>\n&gt; ressed and loot this bracer before it poofs!&quot;.  LOL like I had any<br/>\n&gt; control. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  wowowow.  That&#39;s awesome!  lottoplasms rock.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Seriously, the lead monk went above and beyond (thanks Shishio) to drag <br/>\n&gt; me back to be ressed with two Amy warriors on him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve got monk friends like that too.  Bold little guys, I guess if I<br/>\n  had a button like they do I&#39;d be more daring as well.  Instead of<br/>\n  Feign Death the button should be called &#39;You Can&#39;t Kill Me. Nya Nya&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s a suggestion for a new song:  Denon&#39;s Disco Inferno.  Makes <br/>\n&gt; everyone in your party dance as long as you play it.  Or....makes <br/>\n&gt; the mobs dance and stop attacking you.  Kind of like Lullaby but much<br/>\n&gt; funnier animation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You know, everytime I&#39;m in the PoF - I have to take off all my armor<br/>\n  and play tiny bubbles of music.  Nekkid Dance Party!  Then people also<br/>\n  want to be able to dance with me, but they cant.  I wouldn&#39;t mind if<br/>\n  Verant put in a skill/song/instrument that did nothing more than make<br/>\n  your party members dance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  on a side note:  Has anyone watched an Ogre /dance ?  omfg... it&#39;s<br/>\n                   hilarious.  That is _the_ best emote in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
