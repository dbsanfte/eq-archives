I had just spent about 4 hours in Oggok killing bouncers<br/>\n   with a friend and we had accumulated around 500pp each, so I had<br/>\n   some dough to spend.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I asked people the going price for them, and got answers between 50pp<br/>\n   and 150pp.  So I started auctioning for one.  Got nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n   A friend just told me he had one, and he would trade me for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I offered my useless Staff of Withering, and he jumped on it.<br/>\n   A much better deal for him, than I.  Those staves are worth<br/>\n   a lot more than the fork. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Then greed set in.<br/>\n<br/>\n   He&#39;s like that&#39;s cool, but I really need a good robe.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I had several green silk drapes in the bank I was trying to<br/>\n   get rid of (useless to me).  So I offered the drape for the<br/>\n   fork.  He was estatic.  As he should be, hell that drape is<br/>\n   worth a whole lot more than the fork.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Then more greed set in.<br/>\n<br/>\n   He&#39;s like that&#39;s awesome, but can you get me that Robe of <br/>\n   Enshourdment, I really need that.<br/>\n<br/>\n   At the same time, I just zoned into Innothule, and auctioned<br/>\n   for the fork.  Got one reply, the guy asked me what it was<br/>\n   worth to me, and I told him I hate overinflating prices of<br/>\n   things just because people expect L50s to have 1000s of plat.<br/>\n   I told him at most it was worth 150pp.  He told me great, where<br/>\n   do we meet to trade.  I /who&#39;d him, and he was L21... I thought<br/>\n   great I&#39;ll be here all day waiting for him to find me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I gave him the loc, and less than 1 min later, the guy is poking<br/>\n   me.  Needless to say, I gave him 150pp for the fork, and another<br/>\n   150pp for delivering it so fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Never did send a tell to the person I was dealing with earlier.<br/>\n   He would have definitely made out in the long run, had he not<br/>\n   gotten so greedy.  Ah well, that&#39;s the morale of the story ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
