My Order of Thunder dont help nor does the Charillion<br/>\nsong. Nor does stand in front nor in back nor using sneak.  i might try the<br/>\ninvis song but i am loath to climb up there again because everytime I<br/>\nhave -- I end up falling off!<br/>\n<br/>\nI get told something about half-elfs and she dont sell to me.  I did kill a<br/>\nfew - and i mean only like 2 or 3 aviaks in Lake Rathe - which hits your<br/>\nAviak faction.  You can kill all the Aviak Guards you want - but dont kill<br/>\nthe baby birties.  In SK, you can kill all the chickens you want and they<br/>\nstill sell to you (well not me but others - non-hummies I guess.)  But i<br/>\nthink eventually they do scowl at you.

I noticed their faction was still apprehensive to me (i<br/>\n&gt;am half-elf Quellious follower - guess they don&#39;t like that much =).  I<br/>\n&gt;figured it just wasn&#39;t working...<br/>\n&gt;Then, I walked AROUND the counter to stand directly in front of the npc and<br/>\n&gt;tried again and they became Amiable!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This also happened with the armor merchant in East Freeport - he was<br/>\n&gt;indifferent even with Carillon until i walked AROUND the his counter and<br/>\n&gt;stood in front of him.
