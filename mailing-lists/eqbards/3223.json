We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-895167727\">Yeah I know, Solusek Ro is crazy. I visited some other shards playing<br/>\nyoung ogres(who sprinted to enter the place), and no other server had as<br/>\nmuch as us. We tend to hit 40-50 players easy at night, though very few<br/>\nyoung ones hunting defenders like myself. Hell, we have the most amount<br/>\nof 50s(around 10) of any shard. I&#39;d recommend to any bard to get into<br/>\nCazic-Thule as soon as possible, because its rapdily becomes the next<br/>\ncrushbone, blackburrow, or highpass, otherwise you&#39;ll start to have<br/>\ntrouble getting the items too. They are rare; I&#39;ve been in groups that<br/>\nhave killed 8 tae ews, a clay golem, and the steel golem, and have to<br/>\nsee any rubicite, so you&#39;ll be struggling if your a mid-range player.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalons DuPrey<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth Moursund wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talonus DuPrey writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;... I&#39;m kinda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;surprised you haven&#39;t hunted it down yet, as on Solusek Ro I rarely see<br/>\n&gt; &gt;someone above 30 or so not in cazic-thule once they&#39;ve been there a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt;days, and I kinda feel bad that I haven&#39;t gotten it once, though I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hunted in groups that kiled both golems, and many tae ews, considering<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve hunted there for quite some time now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am also a resident of Solusek Ro.  Indeed, Cazic is &quot;The Place&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; experience and cash from about level 30-39.  However, this means that it<br/>\n&gt; has become insanely crowded as the hump in the population curve hit those<br/>\n&gt; levels.  The courtyard usually has at least 3 groups camping; the throne<br/>\n&gt; room generally 2-3 groups (since pickings get thin with more than 2, one<br/>\n&gt; group will usually get fed up and leave after a while when there are more<br/>\n&gt; than that).  The gator tank closest to the zone usually has a group camped<br/>\n&gt; at it.  The cave down underneath that tank sometimes does (it&#39;s a less<br/>\n&gt; popular spot because it&#39;s difficult to zone from).  The room next to the<br/>\n&gt; Avatar&#39;s spawn point is often-but-not-always camped, but I expect it to<br/>\n&gt; move to the almost always camped stage within another week or so.<br/>\n&gt;  (Currently it&#39;s still in the upper edge of the population curve.)  Word of<br/>\n&gt; the hidden temple in the maze has been spreading, so it&#39;s starting to<br/>\n&gt; become another popular camping site (though not as popular as the others<br/>\n&gt; simply because it&#39;s not as easily reached and doesn&#39;t have the convenient<br/>\n&gt; zone access...however, it has the advantage of freedom from other groups<br/>\n&gt; trains).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The long and short of it is, the special items from Cazic are becoming a<br/>\n&gt; lot more difficult to pick up for yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The highest level dungeons (Nagafen&#39;s Lair, Lower Guk, and deep Mistmoore)<br/>\n&gt; are just beginning to feel the population surge.  (I don&#39;t know about the<br/>\n&gt; ice giant parts of Permafrost -- I haven&#39;t been up there since outgrowing<br/>\n&gt; the goblins.)  I fear that these zones will become nearly unplayable long<br/>\n&gt; before the promised Christmas release of the expansion pack, as more and<br/>\n&gt; more players reach these levels and pile up with nowhere else to go.<br/>\n&gt;  Already the easily accessible entrances to all of these are fairly<br/>\n&gt; steadily camped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hopefully the other planes will be fixed and open sometime soon, providing<br/>\n&gt; more choices.  And perhaps one of the new areas being added to the western<br/>\n&gt; (Erudite) continent will have stuff appropriate for the top levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   - Windsong Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
