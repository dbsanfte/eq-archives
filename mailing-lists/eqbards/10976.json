Be nice if<br/>\n&gt;they reproduced something like that.<br/>\n&gt;Dead Hills.. hopefully that doens&#39;t refer to players.  heheh.<br/>\n&gt;Is there a zone that encompasses the Unkempt Woods or the Jaggedpine <br/>\n&gt;forest?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m guessing the unkempt druids are in the unkempt woods (living in unkempt<br/>\n&gt;houses, no doubt).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Ruins of Kunark is supposed to have 20 zones in it or so I&#39;ve heard.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately it won&#39;t be out until March of next year.  By which time,<br/>\n&gt;unless they&#39;ve added new zones, half the server population will be level 50<br/>\n&gt;with nothing to do. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Gaelaian, sleepy bard of the 19th song, Tunare. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
