I was still smiling a the end of<br/>\nthe night though, because gauntlets dropped and the only other bard there had them<br/>\nalready.  That made 3 pieces for me; I already had legs and one bracer (from Fear<br/>\nhaha).  I was told arms had dropped earlier that day, and decayed =(.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday we had good groups and good pulling.  I quit out only once, and we had very<br/>\nfew deaths.  On one pull the warrior who was chain pulling saw the train coming,<br/>\nwaved us all back into the corner, and ate the death.  *loud applause*  What a great<br/>\nexample of knowing your role and making quick, sound judgements.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we cleared roamers we go a scorn banshee pull.  It dropped boots!  There were<br/>\nthree of us; one already had boots; I lost the roll.  And I sat there and thought to<br/>\nmyself, oh now let the clumpy random number generator work its magic (wished on John<br/>\nKim for luck haha)!  A couple more pulls, then another scorn banshee, and my group<br/>\ngot the kill.  They said &quot;Mara go ahead and look...&quot;  Boots again!  A couple more<br/>\npulls...another scorn banshee...and a bracer for the third bard there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night they were full, so I didn&#39;t get to go up.  The banshees dropped two sets<br/>\nof arms and the weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, I don&#39;t know if they changed the drop rates but I hope it keep up!<br/>\n<br/>\nArms and breastplate left to go for me (I will leave the scary helm wearing to Shada<br/>\nhaha).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n50th Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\nwww.jusdivinum.com<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nP.
