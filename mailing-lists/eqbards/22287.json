It was prompted<br/>\nafter I used Pixie a few nights ago on some irritating casters.  Here is<br/>\nwhat I found (*boggle* at will).<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither Lullaby or Pixie Strike gave a secondary resist message in over 200<br/>\napplications of each.  I tested Lullaby in the usual way versus some lvl 1<br/>\nnewbie mobs in Misty Thicket this time.  My resists for Lullaby were in the<br/>\nrange of 35%.  Pixie Strike also showed no secondary resists and the overall<br/>\nresist level for Pixie Strike against level 1 mobs was 7%!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now for some analysis.  I figure one of three things has happened<br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Secondary resists have been removed and basic resist chance modified to<br/>\ncompensate.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Secondary resists have had their message component removed so it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhit you in <br/>\n   the face how high the secondary resist is.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Secondary resists are now correctly only occurring on mobs above a<br/>\ncertain level (originally claimed by GZ directly to be 35th).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I observed, the resist rate on Lullaby was too high to simply be a<br/>\ncase of the secondary resist being removed on mobs under a certain level.<br/>\nOn the other hand, the resist rate I saw for Pixie Strike showed little<br/>\npossibility that the secondary resist could still be there as it was before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI Pixie Strike&#39;d myself 50 times and never saw a secondary resist message so<br/>\nlevel 32 isn&#39;t the point at which it starts if that&#39;s the issue.  I did<br/>\nresist Pixie Strike 50% of the time however with an MR of 42 which seems<br/>\nhigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I think I&#39;m leaning towards the possibility that the secondary<br/>\nresist is either gone from both and the primary resist rate adjusted<br/>\naccordingly, or that the change has already gone in to reduce the secondary<br/>\non Pixie while at the same time removing the secondary message and just<br/>\ngiving one resist or not based on the two resist chances.<br/>\n<br/>\nthoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
