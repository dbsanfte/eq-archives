There are literally about 14 people in that little room waiting for<br/>\nthe spawns so it was quite safe.  We get to chatting to kill the Sand Giant<br/>\nsized boredom of being in that little room for hours and hours and the subject<br/>\nturns to duels.  I&#39;ve never been in a duel and was soon quite curious as to<br/>\nwhether or not I could beat this Pally so I challenge him.  Well right there<br/>\nin Drelzna&#39;s throne room we start going at it.  I didn&#39;t have a chance to mem<br/>\nsongs just for the purpose of dueling, so what I&#39;m weaving is Anthem, Hymn and<br/>\nBellow - not a bad combo for being unprepared.  I&#39;m wielding Thulian Claws and<br/>\na Dragoon Dirk in magical/banded, while he&#39;s got himself a Silvery Two-Handed<br/>\nWar Axe and chain/plate mail.  Neither wants to die so we agree to go to one<br/>\nbubble and stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all that damn axe hit hard when it hit; he missed fairly often<br/>\n(perhaps his 2HS was low, didn&#39;t ask).  Well he freaking blinded me several<br/>\ntimes which sucked, but I just kept Bellowing at him while blind (pretty<br/>\neffective since he couldn&#39;t leave range).  He tried to root me several times<br/>\nand I resisted them all, but I was easily able to Chain him down when I felt<br/>\nlike it.  He got very lucky toward the end of the fight and hit me hard<br/>\nseveral times in a row with the axe or I would have beaten him pretty handily,<br/>\nbut alas I was only about half a bubble higher than he was when we approached<br/>\nthe pre-defined one bubble mark.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he hit Lay On Hands.  Ouch, hadn&#39;t thought about that one so he beat me<br/>\nfair and square.  A few minutes later I asked if he wanted to try dueling<br/>\nagain.  He declined.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 25th (and holding) bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
