And there it was, a greenie blue thing from over the<br/>\ndune, I ran in and it hit me hard, lost a bubble of health almost<br/>\nimmediately, but then my mage friend cast Malice and I could Fear/Chain it<br/>\nwhilst he blasted and his pet kicked it in, along with the help from me and<br/>\na few staff procs, we took it down with very little health loss (me 2 bubbs<br/>\nand my friedn 1 bub). I looted and oh yes 1 Opalline helm. Now all I need<br/>\nis the Mudwater rune however I don&#39;t really like cazic.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall last night was bad for me, I died twice (once in Lower Guk - mino<br/>\ntrained on me) and (2 SG&#39;s killed me almost instantly at the S Ro zone) and<br/>\nended up at a 1/2 bubble loss. I&#39;m now KOS to froggies so that sucks, I now<br/>\nhave to invis when going through upper guk &lt;sighs&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 2 weeks I&#39;ve come very close to obtaining my fulll suit of Lambent,<br/>\nonly 1 bracer and the helm to go, I have the DB Bracelet and Opalline helm<br/>\nnow, I just need some money for gems and the last 2 items. I doubt I will<br/>\nwear my Lambent Helm and Bracers though, the stats on my SSB and +5 Dex +3<br/>\nStr bracers are nicer. I just want the helm and bracers for when I am<br/>\ncharming stuff and for general roleplay to look good eg. weddings etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan, Bard of 29 songs and staying that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
