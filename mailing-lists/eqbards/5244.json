The way I<br/>\nread it, your Charisma stat has no impact whatsoever on your chances to<br/>\nresist a spell directed at you.  Makes sense to me.  The second sentence<br/>\n&quot;..interact/affect creatures&quot; seems to indicate that a higher charisma means<br/>\nyou have a better chance of affecting mobs with your songs, i.e. less chance<br/>\nfor them to resist.  This reopens the issue I raised last week.  Example:<br/>\nTwo 20th level bards attempt to use Lullaby song against a 23d level mob.<br/>\nOne bard has a charisma of 85.  The other bard has charisma of 100.  Singing<br/>\nand instrument skills both the same.  Based on how I interpret Butler&#39;s<br/>\ncomment, the bard with the 100 charisma has a better chance of putting the<br/>\nmob to sleep.  If charisma has no effect on mob resistance, then both bards<br/>\nwould have an equal chance of putting the mob to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like to know the correct answer to this issue.  I wear items<br/>\nthat increase my charisma for the sole purpose of increasing my chances of<br/>\naffecting mobs with my songs.  I have other items I can wear that increase<br/>\nother stats as well as improve my AC.  If charisma doesn&#39;t affect mobs<br/>\nresistance, there is no reason, for me to wear the charisma increasing items<br/>\nunless I am selling stuff to merchants.  I guess wearing the charisma items<br/>\nto reduce my chance of missing notes is a reason to wear them but I could<br/>\nlive with missing the notes in exchange for the benefit the other items<br/>\ngive.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;     Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>\n&gt;     one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>\n&gt;     interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>\n&gt;     Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess this explains where the talk about charisma affecting<br/>\n&gt; missed notes started.  And the talk about charisma not<br/>\n&gt; affecting resists is a misinterpretation (your charisma does<br/>\n&gt; not affect *your* resist rate).  The entire post is included<br/>\n&gt; below if you&#39;re interested in the other stuff:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
