The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the fight<br/>\n    was the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was the<br/>\n    message enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
