To me this is a game of optimization.  How<br/>\ndo I optimize my time to level/get items faster?  How do I<br/>\noptimize my songs/attacks to let me kill harder stuff?  The<br/>\ntime it takes me to run back to my corpse vs. getting bound<br/>\ncloser is just another factor for me to optimize.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven your avowed hatred for running through the zone naked to<br/>\nget back to your corpse, I&#39;d assume it would&#39;ve been obvious<br/>\nthe best way to minimize your time doing that would be to<br/>\nfirst get bound closer, even if it took an hour to find<br/>\nsomeone to bind you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe silly thing is I completely agree with you that I see no<br/>\nreason for having a difference between what zones binders and<br/>\nnon-binders can bind at.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
