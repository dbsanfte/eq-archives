I was trying it on mobs way below<br/>\nme and got 16 successes in 83 pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn mobs that were blue to me it was even more ridiculous if that&#39;s possible.<br/>\nI got 2 successes in 41 pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only get a primary resist about 25% of the time or thereabouts.  The<br/>\nsecondary resist however where you fail to mesmerize happens about 75% of<br/>\nthe time that I don&#39;t get a primary resist.  All in all, totally and<br/>\ncompletely useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see a log file where it was working.  Are you sure you weren&#39;t<br/>\ngetting that secondary resist message?  I can&#39;t even get it to stick on lvl<br/>\n1 mobs more than 50% of the time and haven&#39;t since lvl 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\nAt what level does Kellins stop being effective?
