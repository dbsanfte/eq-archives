We cheated.  We exploited the fact that this guy was stuck<br/>\n&gt;in a gate to escpe with our skins intact.

Monster can hurt me.<br/>\nTherefore monster is a valid legal target.  The fact is, the company is<br/>\nallowing NPCs to cheat (cf. Sharks attacking people levitating), but won&#39;t<br/>\nallow us to take advantage of real-world physics (a monster isn&#39;t smart<br/>\nenough to climb over the gate, so he keeps blasting with spells.)  I&#39;m a<br/>\nbit disappointed in Verant&#39;s whole &quot;we don&#39;t care if it&#39;s our fault - you<br/>\nstill can&#39;t do it&quot; policy.  That&#39;s like me going over to your house,<br/>\nplaying monopoly, and getting kicked out when I put two hotels on the same<br/>\nspot.  Rather than fix the issue (which they continuously claim to be<br/>\ndoing, yet these bugs still exist?) they penalize the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you jump on me about this, let me point out something - many of<br/>\nthese mobs have the ability to target us through walls, all casters can<br/>\ncast through walls - this puts players at a distinct disadvantage. Sure,<br/>\nthere&#39;s the potential for abuse - so I say, Verant, fix the pathing<br/>\nproblems, but stop bopping people for defending themselves.  Geez  - they<br/>\nsee nothing wrong with Mules (goodbye economy) or twinking (goodbye game<br/>\nbalance), but this they have a problem with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing my account is cancelled, or I&#39;d cancel it *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I do hope they fix some of these bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
