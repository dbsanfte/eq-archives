However, I think that there are a few<br/>\nstones left unturned (as far as new song abilities/effects go), so there<br/>\nmight be a chance that we see something totally new - which would be great<br/>\nIMO.  Personally, I have this feeling that they&#39;re going to reorganize the<br/>\nentire top-end of the song listing (30+).  It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense<br/>\nthe way it&#39;s configured now (IMO).  It&#39;s kinda sad... after I hit 32 (which<br/>\nshould be later this week), I don&#39;t have any songs to _really_ look forward<br/>\nto, other than the 48 and 50 songs.  I know there are some good ones along<br/>\nthe way, but nothing compared to the &quot;game winners&quot; that we get below 32.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 31 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
