That used to be a very buggy<br/>\narea where unsuspecting people could get charmed through the walls (without<br/>\never even seeing Meldrath at all).  Then of course, he&#39;d march you straight<br/>\ninto his lair with the mino guards.  Heh.

The fear spell was bad<br/>\n&gt;enough, but my party was being reamed by the DoTs (L38 bard<br/>\n&gt;and ranger, L31 cleric).  Individually the mobs there are not<br/>\n&gt;difficult, but the spawn time is 7 minutes, and just as you<br/>\n&gt;finish up the last mob, the first one spawns again.  By the<br/>\n&gt;time we finally got a small break, everyone was down to almost<br/>\n&gt;one bubble and OOM.  Don&#39;t walk in there expecting it to be a<br/>\n&gt;pushover because everything is green or blue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At the high 30s, you resist his fear spell a lot, but he casts<br/>\n&gt;it so often that eventually one gets through (even with me<br/>\n&gt;playing Purifying Rhythms with a MM drum).  That leaves your<br/>\n&gt;party one man down, which in a party of 2 or 3 is a tremendous<br/>\n&gt;handicap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
