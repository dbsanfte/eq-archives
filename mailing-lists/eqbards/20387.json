Somethings have built<br/>\nin resistance and I will switch to weapons when I encouter these.  But they<br/>\nare not all that common.  Stuff that resists the song because of level<br/>\ndifference will also resist damage when you melee: Sylly hits a red mob_00<br/>\nfor 8 points of damage!  Woo heee, 4 thousand more hits like that and this<br/>\nguy is toast!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am in hard places, its with the &quot;perfect group&quot; and we have clerics<br/>\nand enchanters.  I dont need to haste folks or heal folks.  Unless it&#39;s a<br/>\nGod or Dragon, I am not doing the heavy duty resists either.  In my mana<br/>\nsong weave, I add Nillipus.  Why?  Selos Drums adds 35 AC to them.  If they<br/>\nhave that for for even just the opening rounds of combat, it should be<br/>\nhelping them.  If a series of mobs has inately high resists (usually a<br/>\nnative fire or cold resist) I swap to a weave with Nillipus instead of the<br/>\nresisted chant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am in &#39;easy places&#39;, it&#39;s been me and a &quot;rooter&quot; and he roots and I<br/>\nbard dot-nuke.  I like to stand off and watch the mobs health bar&#39;s dwindle.<br/>\nSome ppl like to swing weapons - fine.  Some ppl need to see numbers - fine.<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s just me, but I can contribute significant damage from a distance<br/>\n(albeit without the visual satisfaction of seeing weps swing and hits for 12<br/>\npoints of damage scroll by) without adding to an already busy cleric&#39;s<br/>\nworrys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that there may be more than one way to be &quot;the most effective bard.&quot;<br/>\nCircumstances will vary depending on what weps and what magic instruments<br/>\nyou have, who is in your group, where you are hunting, and what mobs you are<br/>\nfighting.  Sometimes song only are better for damage, sometimes it better to<br/>\nleave the direct damage to others and to keep the group alive with buffs and<br/>\nresists, sometimes it&#39;s better to swing weps and join the melee.  I dont<br/>\nreally see that there is &quot;one way&quot; to be &quot;the most effective...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 09, 2000 11:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bards forgotten again....
