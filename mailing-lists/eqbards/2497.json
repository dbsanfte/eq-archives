The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-718181065\">Well you&#39;ve thought this out a whole lot more than I have hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would suggest that J.M. knows the answer, but I would bet my<br/>\n&gt; bard&#39;s life that he isn&#39;t going to post a formula.  Firstly he<br/>\n&gt; likely wouldn&#39;t want to, and secondly it may be against a<br/>\n&gt; confidentiality clause in his contract.  ;)<br/>\n&gt; Besides, it would ruin all the fun we have of throwing ideas<br/>\n&gt; back and forth. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I thought the same thing, but you never know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You haven&#39;t stated your &#39;skill lvl/strength bonuses&#39;.  Personally<br/>\n&gt; I HATE magic numbers (I&#39;m a programmer), so throwing in a &#39;9&#39; is<br/>\n&gt; unsatisfactory without explanation, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, seems too simple doesnt it. The thing is, back in my newbie days, I could<br/>\nhit for 17 with a mino axe. So I just assumed the formula was, as I stated<br/>\nearlier,weapon dmg * 2 + strength/skill bonuses. And with the mino axe it&#39;d be<br/>\n8 * 2 + 1 (It&#39;d make sense that my strength/skill bonus would only amount to<br/>\n1, since I was a newbie afterall). This formula seemed to remain true through<br/>\nout my character&#39;s life as I went from weapon to weapon. Combine LS, barbed<br/>\nwhips, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Obviously.  Firstly you didn&#39;t say what skill that weapon used,<br/>\n&gt; so i can&#39;t check my own formula.  But assuming it is a 1H or<br/>\n&gt; piercing weapon, my formula gives max damage of 34.  Pretty close,<br/>\n&gt; if not correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, a 1h weapon. I am a bard afterall =) Also, last night I peaked at 36 dmg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I have a problem with a dmg * (something) + something else.<br/>\n&gt; Personally the idea of dmg * (something + something else) is more<br/>\n&gt; appealing to me, as it gives greater return as &#39;something&#39; and<br/>\n&gt; &#39;something else&#39; (say STR and skill) increase.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whatever you say =) You seem to have a better understanding of mathematics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The inconsistent results you recieved also suggest that whatever<br/>\n&gt; formula you used to get your magic number &#39;9&#39; is wrong.  Did you<br/>\n&gt; actually use a formula, or did you just say &quot;dmg * 2 - max = 9,<br/>\n&gt; so the modifier must be + 9&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; The fact that it doesn&#39;t work suggests that the modifier is not<br/>\n&gt; just a linear addend.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well as I said before, about my Mino axe days. The dmg * 2 + variable seemed<br/>\nto work.As I progressed through levels, it has always been dmg * 2 + 1, dmg *<br/>\n2 + 2,<br/>\ndmg * 2 + 3, +4, +5, +6 etc etc, up until now where its at +9... until I used<br/>\nthis new weapon that seems to break the rules. (Which I dont mind, hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother theory: I&#39;ve never used a weapon before that had a greater base dmg<br/>\nthan 8 (yea, the mino axe). Perhaps there&#39;s a different formula for different<br/>\ndmg weapons. Like 2h weapons seem to have totally different rules. My ranger<br/>\nfriend can hit for 61 with a 2h black iron bastard sword, which has a base dmg<br/>\nof 20. So what I&#39;m getting at, is maybe there&#39;s a different formula for<br/>\nweapons that have a greater base damage than say... 10.<br/>\nAnd a different formula for those greater than say 15. Regardless if the<br/>\nweapon is 1h or 2h.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As posted earlier by myself, i believe the formula is something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; dmg * max( (skill in weapon + STR)/100 , 2) + 1<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, what is the &quot;max&quot; you refer to?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, ever take a look at the ATK? Maybe you can figure out a way that it fits<br/>\ninto a formula, since the ATK number adds up offense skill, weapon skill (the<br/>\nweapon in your primary hand) and strength. Perhaps maximum dmg is related<br/>\ndirectly to your ATK? Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
