The point was whether<br/>\nit&#39;d be more effective to have a real tank tank it (at the<br/>\ncost of losing his damage on the primary target).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne nice side effect of having all the extras on me was that<br/>\nalmost our entire group managed to zone when we overpulled and<br/>\ngot 4.  I played Screech, and surprisingly it stuck most of<br/>\nthe time.  The giants ran, my guild (2 groups) ran.  When the<br/>\ngiants stopped running, they were only interested in summoning<br/>\nme, and I&#39;d just fear them again.
