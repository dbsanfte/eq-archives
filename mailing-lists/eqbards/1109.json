The class of bard in Everquest is NOT<br/>\nthe wandering Celtic minstrel that people in the SCA love.  They are also not<br/>\nfolk singers like Joni Mitchell and they are not rock singers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to roleplay yourself like a &quot;classic&quot; bard, then more power to you,<br/>\nbut you are really limiting yourself.  The class is designed and balanced to<br/>\nuse plate, it&#39;s one of the reasons we don&#39;t get double attack or the use of<br/>\nbows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I think people who limit their characters for the sake of roleplay are<br/>\ncool, like a dwarf who will only use two handed axes, or a rogue who never<br/>\nsteals for personal reasons, I think that those cases should be rare and<br/>\nflavourful rather than the way people SHOULD play.  Otherwise, magicians could<br/>\nonly saw people in half and pull rabbits out of hats, and that would make them<br/>\nreally terrible in combat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
