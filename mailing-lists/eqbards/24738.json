But I think this was a seat-of-the-pants guesstimate as to how often a pet would do a majority of the damage (and hence take half the exp).  I think they still get half the exp if they do a majority of the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kenross Cantoforjado, 58 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Christopher Sanders wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; I was under the impression that this changed along with the major experience<br/>\n  &gt; changes a couple months back?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Could be wrong, but I really do remember a quote as saying pets take no exp,<br/>\n  &gt; with no qualifications given.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Atonal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
