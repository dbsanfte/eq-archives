The <br/>\n     Bagpipes of death.  These puppies perhaps would increase the effect of <br/>\n     damage and fear spells.  Hopefully a DD effect since I just can&#39;t get <br/>\n     AOE damage spells not to cause my almost instant demise.  And the <br/>\n     graphic (if they bothered) would be most amusing.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     I remember watching a WWII movie showing the British landing at <br/>\n     Normandy.  There they were, right in the middle with bullets whizzing <br/>\n     and shells exploding, a group of Scottish bagpipers playing and <br/>\n     marching right up the beach into German fire. Wonderful image! (and <br/>\n     people say bards are pure fantasy,  humph)  Anyway, if they had a <br/>\n     quest for magic bagpipes I wouldn&#39;t sleep till I owned my own.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold  18th (still)<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard Instuments Wishlist<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-elijah (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    7/26/99 9:57 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nIt sure would be nice to have some more magic instruments in the game. After <br/>\nmuch consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm) would be a regular <br/>\nol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You awaken in the <br/>\nArena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to cross...wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>\nwonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory? No, we can&#39;t <br/>\nbind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you could really <br/>\nleverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum. Sure, I keep one <br/>\nin the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning to the bank to <br/>\nget it is just not what I have patience for after dying... Just a thought, <br/>\none born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>\n     <br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSee homepage for details, including our weekly drawing!<br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
