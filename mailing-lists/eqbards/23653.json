I read it as so-called<br/>\n&quot;small things&quot; - is a billion dollars ever small? - do add up.  The irony of<br/>\nthe quote being that some folks consider &quot;a billion here & a billion there&quot;<br/>\nfairly trivial.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the fact that there are so many choices.  With bards your choices<br/>\nchange over time as you get more songs to choose from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother situation where damage shields and every increment that can get<br/>\nadded to them becomes important is on the bigger mobs that are hitting alot<br/>\nof folks at very fast rates.  Damage shieds can do a considerable amount of<br/>\ndamage - especially when the mob is hitting very fast on many people. Sort<br/>\nof the converse of many mobs hitting a few people - one very fast mob<br/>\nhitting a bunch of people.  We (our guild) use them.  When we fight big<br/>\nmobs, one of the very first concerns is getting the damage shields on the<br/>\nmobs - off as fast as we can.  As much for preventing players from going LD<br/>\nas mitigating the damage everyone will take attacking a mob with a DS.  The<br/>\nother thing that gets done as soon as possible is MR debuffing the mob.<br/>\nTash, Malo, etc. Then we slow the mob if at all possible: tugurs (sp?),<br/>\nshiftless deeds, etc. And of course snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when I see a bard following that line of thinking: MR debuff, slow<br/>\nattack, slow movement, damage shield; it does not seem so wrong.  I grant<br/>\nyou that there are other choices - and I mentioned that we would need to<br/>\nknow what level the bard is/was to know what choices he did have.  I just<br/>\nbristle at blanket statements like &quot;...it&#39;s always this...&quot; or &quot;... that&#39;s<br/>\nnever right..&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
