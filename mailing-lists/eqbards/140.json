Kinda like how you can switch from your melee weapon to your<br/>\nrange weapon. I dunno about anyone else, but its a real pain when you<br/>\nwant to sit down and rest after a battle to open up your persona, click<br/>\non the Inv button above your player image, then click on your weapon,<br/>\ndrop it in your inv, click on your shield (or secondary weapon), drop it<br/>\nin your inv, and then get your lute (or other instrument) which may be<br/>\nin a backpack or something, and put it in your secondary hand. And then<br/>\nby the time you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;re fully healed, so you have to do the<br/>\nexact reverse.<br/>\nThis may sound like a tedious task, but when you&#39;re in danger or trying<br/>\nto equip your drum while running for your life, it really makes a<br/>\ndifference. Or when you have to tell your party members to hold on while<br/>\nyour equip or unequip your instrument before they take off on you.<br/>\nI have my mouse sensitivity all the way up, and I keep all my<br/>\ninstruments and weapons in my inv slots (not in backpacks) so I can do<br/>\nthis as quickly as possible, but its still not a very quick operation,<br/>\neven if it is done smoothly.<br/>\nThe other alternative is to never, or hardly ever use a weapon/shield<br/>\nand just use hand to hand. But thats not always wise, especially when<br/>\nsoloing, or with a small group who depend on your 16 or 17 dam from your<br/>\nminotaur axe to keep the situation from getting ugly.<br/>\nIf anyone else has feels the same way about this, PLEASE fill out a<br/>\nfeedback form in-game by typing /feedback and requesting such an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood day to you all, and may your songs of battle bring pride upon us.<br/>\nMaev<br/>\nBard of Freeport<br/>\nRealm of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
