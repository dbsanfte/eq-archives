From what I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191314926\">I believe your formula is correct in a general sense.  However, I have heard<br/>\nthat the skill cap formula you listed does not apply to every skill.  From<br/>\nwhat I have read, it mainly applies to combat skills, magic skills, and for<br/>\na bard, singing/instrument skills<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think trade skills are affected by your level whatsoever.  In<br/>\ntheory, you could have a first level character with a Master rating in a<br/>\ntrade skill.  I have heard of players in guilds doing this.  One guild<br/>\nmember creates a character who will do nothing in the game but practice one<br/>\nparticular trade.  Other guild members continue feeding money into this<br/>\ncharacter so he builds his trade skill up.  In this way, guild members can<br/>\nget items at a discount rate/free without having to spend their own playing<br/>\ntime building up their trade skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also seen posts from this list that state bards, as well as other<br/>\nclasses, have a class ceiling on certain skills.  I don&#39;t know for certain<br/>\nwhich skills this applies to or what the ceiling is.  I would be interested<br/>\nto see this list once the correct information is known.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tFun Bob [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, May 14, 1999 1:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Skill Cap<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just to get everyone clear on the subject, your skill cap is <br/>\n&gt; 5 Times your Level, +5<br/>\n&gt; So, say your 10th level, your skill cap will be 55<br/>\n&gt; 10*5=50+5=55<br/>\n&gt; Rolande, drunken Bard of Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
