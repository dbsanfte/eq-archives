Sometime around June.  I think<br/>\nit&#39;s likely that he played during beta (where we all learned to do without<br/>\nHarmony and a few other spells that were broken/not implemented at the<br/>\ntime.).  Because of this he may just never have bothered learning it when he<br/>\ngot the chance in final.  Or he asked friends who played during beta and was<br/>\ntold &quot;It&#39;s broken, don&#39;t bother&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself fell victim to the &#39;beta mentality&#39; and when my ranger had the<br/>\nchance to get harmony at 15 never used it until my mid 20&#39;s.... go figure.<br/>\nOnce I realized it actually worked I was thrilled.  To top all that off most<br/>\nof the sites listing spell effects were just cloning older lists made during<br/>\nbeta.  None reflected that harmony worked correctly (nor what it did) until<br/>\nlate summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 20, 2000 11:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] re: Class Balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Really?
