Went to the yeti caves in<br/>\nDreadlands and Lament pulled a single yeti (blue con) outside.  Weaved<br/>\nJonthan&#39;s, Chains and Fear.  For the first time in a long time, I solo<br/>\ntanked a mob to death.  The haste with Jonthan&#39;s is tremendous.  I would<br/>\nestimate it is close to enchanter&#39;s SLW.  The only time I ever got hit was<br/>\nwhen fear broke early.  Most fights I would only lose one bub of health, two<br/>\nif I was really unlucky.  Tried the same tactic with a stonegazer cockatrice<br/>\nwith similar results.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it will help us solo<br/>\nblue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune shield, soloing would<br/>\nbe even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne drawback that I did notice was it didn&#39;t stack with Berserker (and I<br/>\nassume our other combat enhancing songs) for other party members.  Since<br/>\nJonthan&#39;s Provocation is self only, other songs like Berserker should still<br/>\naffect everyone in the group beside the bard.  This is not the case.  I<br/>\ntested it by starting Jonthan&#39;s, then starting Berserker.  I asked the<br/>\nothers in my party if they were getting the message &quot;You go berserk&quot; as well<br/>\nas an icon on the screen.  As long as I had Jonthan&#39;s in effect on myself,<br/>\nno one else in the party got the benefit of Berserker.  This sounds like a<br/>\nbug to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n45 bard  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
