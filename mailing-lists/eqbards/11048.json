I broke root with selo&#39;s<br/>\neverytime on a pulse.  I even wouldn&#39;t run it<br/>\nconstantly and I could start it up and break the root<br/>\non the first pulse.  Haven&#39;t checked on mobs. <br/>\nUsually, the ones that root me lately can kill me in 3<br/>\ncasts anyway, so I don&#39;t really have a good way to<br/>\ntest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1999 08:28:12 -0700 <br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Un-Broken Song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I<br/>\n&gt; tested some more to see<br/>\n&gt; what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted<br/>\n&gt; and Accelerando is not<br/>\n&gt; up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running<br/>\n&gt; when you get Rooted<br/>\n&gt; however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot;<br/>\n&gt; pulse message will break you<br/>\n&gt; free.  This happened every time I tried it, both<br/>\n&gt; with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>\n&gt; The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new<br/>\n&gt; zone caused the Root<br/>\n&gt; icon to again take hold.  <br/>\n&gt; For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you<br/>\n&gt; get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>\n&gt; the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording<br/>\n&gt; despite my actual real<br/>\n&gt; testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; goes down though you will<br/>\n&gt; not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that<br/>\n&gt; Root icon still on your<br/>\n&gt; screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
