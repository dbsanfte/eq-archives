There were<br/>\nonly two other people in Paw, a ranger and a cleric.  The ranger was maxxed,<br/>\nand the cleric was his alt that he was power-leveling.  He asked me if I<br/>\nwanted a Kisch, and after he told me that stats, I jumped at the chance.  I<br/>\ninvis&#39;d and met him (and his cleric) at his spot in the open area just<br/>\noutside near the first door into that old captain&#39;s area.  After 2 or 3<br/>\nspawns, he tells me to loot, and -=presto!=-  I am Kisch&#39;d  :o)  Right time,<br/>\nright place.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n35th<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Rosha Unca &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:captrosha@...\">captrosha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 06, 2000 8:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Newbie Bard needs hunting suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Going for a Kisch at 19??
