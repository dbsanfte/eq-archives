I think level 15 is well beyond the lifespan of a mino<br/>\nAxe.  I bought a combine longsword around that time which enabled me to fight<br/>\ninvulnerable critters as well as being a fine all around weapon.  I also started<br/>\ndeveloping some secondary weapon skills in anticipation of level 17.  I decided<br/>\nthat a rapier is great weapon because of its speed.  When I got dual wield I<br/>\nstarted using a combine longsword in one hand and a rapier or main-gauche in the<br/>\nother.  For tough battles I used the longword in the dominant hand, but for easy<br/>\nbattles I switch hands to get more opportunities to improve the poorer skill.<br/>\nYou can find lots of bronze rapiers and main-gauches at the Dervish Cutthroat<br/>\ncamp in west commons.  I have not upgraded the rapier to a combine yet, but I<br/>\nwill soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
