For those of you with a lot of<br/>\nexperience hunting in that zone, would like your feedback.  Since all of the<br/>\nmobs there will be 45+, I assume Pixie Strike will not be that effective.<br/>\nNot certain how well Charm will work.  I know once I get to 53 and get SoT<br/>\nthen crowd control will be a lot easier.  But until then, how effective will<br/>\nI be at performing crowd control in Sebilis?  Would it be smarter to hang<br/>\nout in Karnors and other zones until I get to 53 and head to Sebilis then?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
