I&#39;ve always assumed the knockback component pushed the mob away from the Bard.  Instead, it pushes it in the direction the Bard is facing (was very handy to learn &#39;cause we were in the tower, and it&#39;s easy to knock mobs off of it :).  Does anyone know if the 53rd song does the same?  Only 51 here, so it&#39;s gonna be a while before I can test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, anyone ever climbed outside of Chardok? : )   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clandlc.com/chardok.jpg\">http://www.clandlc.com/chardok.jpg</a>  Very easy to do with Song of Travel, and was a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, herding Bumble Bees on Tarew Marr<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clandlc.com/bee.jpg\">http://www.clandlc.com/bee.jpg</a> hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
