There&#39;s a 2-person<br/>\n&quot;kiting&quot; method that works similarly.  One person with SoW<br/>\nnukes/taunts a mob to get it mad at him and runs in circles.  <br/>\nThe other person stands in the middle and blasts at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low health<br/>\n&gt; - I guess that would have worked too.

I&#39;ve never tried it<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m afraid of Merv instantly whacking the guard<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m no longer a valid target and the guard is on his<br/>\nhate list, and I&#39;ll take the faction hit.
