After <br/>\ncamping and finally getting these for 2 of the guild paladins (*sigh*, one <br/>\nmore to go), we went to lower guk for a break. It occurred to me to switch <br/>\nfrom Anthem to Chant for the dex boost to see if that would get more casts <br/>\non the undead frogs. One paladin was pretty sure it did help. Since then, <br/>\nthey have debated whether to get dex boost items. The other paladin got some <br/>\ndex boosts later on and now thinks it makes no difference. The point of this <br/>\nramble: when fighting undead with paladins using Ghoulsbanes, try Chant and <br/>\nsee if they think it helps the sword&#39;s casts.<br/>\nI finally hit hell 1, L30 after many misadventures. Ever wonder what is in <br/>\nthe caves under the aviak guard island in Lake Rathe? I can confirm that <br/>\ncave connects to the cave under the island straight out from the docks at <br/>\nthe Rathe Mountain zone pass. I can also tell you that L40ish spellcasting <br/>\ndeepwater goblins live in the tower in the cave underwater. Great place to <br/>\ndie. Fortunately, we did this exploration prior to me leveling. Not much <br/>\nchance of a rez there, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe Journeys,<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
