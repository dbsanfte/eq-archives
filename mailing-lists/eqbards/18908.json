There are a couple of<br/>\nissues that I&#39;d like to pull out and comment on now though:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Angstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech (26) ┬û Fear does not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>interrupt<br/>\ncasting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear (no matter who its cast by) has never interrupted NPCs who are<br/>\ncasting spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input. Lots of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good suggestions out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably shouldn&#39;t be included in a list of &quot;bugs&quot;. One day we<br/>\nmight put one in, but we don&#39;t have anything planned for this slot at<br/>\npresent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Item Switching: No other class switches items as much as bards -<br/>\n </span></blockquote>period. Bards are constantly switching between instruments because of<br/>\nsong requirements or increased effects. Why should the interface be<br/>\nsuch a pain or cause carpal tunnel?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve spoken about several options including a drop confirmation, and<br/>\na /command that would make you swap out your items in specific<br/>\ninventory slots. I&#39;m not sure when, or if we will something<br/>\nimplemented here, but it&#39;s on our whishlist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is the gem #?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys twice every<br/>\n3 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably not. We&#39;d really like to see bards actively played, rather<br/>\nthan passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more<br/>\ndexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a<br/>\nbard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3<br/>\ndifferent melodies and change instruments at the same time is a<br/>\nformidable bard indeed<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Possible, but it would be low priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Magical bard musical instruments give no indication of their<br/>\n </span></blockquote>effect on the player (+5% String, +20% Percussion, +10% to Brass,<br/>\netc). It would be nice to either see this info with a right click or<br/>\nwhen using the identification song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bonus varies on a per song/per instrument basis. I&#39;d doubt that<br/>\nwe could come up with a concise representation, and I&#39;m also not sure<br/>\nthat we&#39;d want to. There are other held items in the game that<br/>\nincrease the effectiveness of spells and do not specify by how much<br/>\nin their description.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Oversight: Bards are now using mana on 2 songs, but do not get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>benefits of clarity or mana song. Why are bards the ONLY casting<br/>\nclass that do not get mana regeneration benefits?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot an oversight at all. We needed a method to place hard limits on<br/>\nhow well, how often, and how long a specific song could be sung. We<br/>\ndecided that we didn&#39;t want anything to adjust that limit. We have<br/>\noffered to switch DDD to a resing timer (same as a recast timer), but<br/>\nthe charm song will remain on mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha, Woodelf Bard<br/>\nGuildleader, Legends<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
