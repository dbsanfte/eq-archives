The first time I saw a bard was when I exited my<br/>\nguild, singing the new song they had just taught me. That was the first<br/>\ntime I saw a bard. A most memorable bard sighting of mine was back a<br/>\nfew songs ago, maybe six or seven. I was hunting cats and spiders with<br/>\na group of friends in West Commonlands. At the time, I was singing one<br/>\nof my newer songs, helping my friends heal. Then, a gleam in the<br/>\ndistance caught my eye. I thought it was the sun at first, but it was<br/>\nway too small. It came at me at the highest speed, faster than my<br/>\nAccelerando had ever carried me. It appeared to be flying over the<br/>\nhills of the commonlands. Suddenly, it was close enough for me to see<br/>\nwhat it was. It was a bard, like me! He obviously was much more<br/>\nadvanced than I was. I knew that from listening to a song still foreign<br/>\nto my ears. I vowed that one day I too would gain that ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\n<br/>\n2 more things. We have since found out that bards&#39; spells get<br/>\nadditional effects at higher levels. So, it was not my video card.<br/>\nSecond: Roop, I just read about the tournament thing you are having. It<br/>\nis an amazing idea, and wish that I could join. Perhaps one day,<br/>\nCazic-thule will see its like.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
