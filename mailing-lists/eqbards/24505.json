I was in a group hunting &quot;the pit&quot; last <br/>\nFriday, and we fought and killed Khelkar twice. On his second death, <br/>\nhe dropped the lute [which I was lucky enough to get.] (It is a rare <br/>\ndrop, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth times we fought him, he was level 59. He was slain once with 12 <br/>\npeople, and once with 18. (18 was an overkill, though.) By the way, <br/>\nthe time we tried him with 6 resulted in 5 reses and a redo. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nLute of the Howler<br/>\nPRIMARY &lt;-- Can use an off-hand weapon with it.<br/>\nEffect: Illusion Werewolf (+100ATT, +30STR, +40% Haste) <br/>\n[I have not verified the haste %]<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Notes: <br/>\n(1) You *can* stack the DE illusion over the WW illusion, and you get <br/>\nthe bonus of the WW, but look like a DE. I assume (not tested) other <br/>\nillusions work as well. [I want to see if Boon stacks with it -- add <br/>\nin another +100DEX.]<br/>\n(2) Illusion WW is NOT the same as Boon<br/>\n(3) I have not verified the % song increase, but I do know it is a <br/>\nlittle less than my Seven String Lute, so (just guessing) I would <br/>\nplace it at about 15%.<br/>\n(4) If you use the illusion much, start expecting requests for <br/>\nclarity. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
