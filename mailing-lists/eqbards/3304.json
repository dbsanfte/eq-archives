GREAT Loot, GREAT Experience points, but you NEED to have a group. Sure, you can solo by the zone edge, but then risk zoning into the loving arms of bouncer Hurd. Cazic is a cool place, but the nearest bind point is pretty far away. Still, well worth it in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother place you can try are the orcs in Highpass Hold. Good XP, decent loot. And again, you can fight right by the zone. You can also be bound in the keep, so you are right next to your corpse if you decide to leave one (smile).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of suggestions.<br/>\nMy 2 copper&#39;s worth,<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - 34th Verse<br/>\nBertox<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Jason Florea &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jflorea@...\">jflorea@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Monday, July 12, 1999 7:36 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [eqbards] Leveling at 22 <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I&#39;m a level 22 bard and have caught a snag in my experience gathering.  Anyone have any good suggestions for me? I have been stuck at level 22 and keep going backwards.
