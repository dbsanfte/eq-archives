So<br/>\n&gt; what you do is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)  You teach the other person, until their skill is maxed (i.e., it<br/>\n&gt;     becomes your skill + 1)<br/>\n&gt; 2)  The both of you zone (to update the skill list, like, if you get<br/>\n&gt;     trained in a language up to excellent, you have to zone before it<br/>\n&gt;     shows up as excellent)<br/>\n&gt; 3)  The other person now has your skill + 1, so he teaches you (to his<br/>\n&gt;     skill + 1, which is your skill + 2)<br/>\n&gt; 4)  Zone<br/>\n&gt; 5)  Repeat<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eventually you&#39;ll max it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Miriana Windryder<br/>\n&gt; Priestess of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks to all who posted this method.  It&#39;s a lot faster (and cheaper) <br/>\nthan the method I had imagined (which had to do with starting newbies and <br/>\nusing their skill points, with a large cash infusion).  I figure it would <br/>\ntake about 2-4 hours to raise from one point on one person to excellent <br/>\non both (depending on zone load time, intelligence and attention level).<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to note that it should, then, be possible to tag-team two (or <br/>\nmore) languages at once, for example:<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson A trains Person B in Language 1 for two skills<br/>\nPerson B trains Person A in Language 2 for two skills (simultaneously)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen zone and switch languages, repeat, then zone back and switch <br/>\nlanguages...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, you should be able to train up to six languages at once (one for <br/>\neach grouped member), although odd numbers would be hard to keep track of <br/>\n (since you would need to cycle the languages, rather than just switch <br/>\nback and forth).  Still, it shouldn&#39;t take that much longer to do <br/>\nmultiple languages.  Anyone on Innoruuk want to try it?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 25th song, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
