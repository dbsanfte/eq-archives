I never<br/>\nfelt more powerful in my life :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil yesterday...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust dinged 52 (no Song of Twilight) and I&#39;m in the hand camp in Karnors<br/>\nwith SK, Monk (great puller, this guy made us wonder why anyone wants<br/>\nenchanters), Cleric, Shaman, and Rogue.  Monk pulls 2 decayed prisoners (he<br/>\nstarted intentionally pulling 2 since we would kill them faster with me<br/>\ncharming).  We screw up the room timer (in other words I forgot to look at<br/>\nmy watch) and of course a Construct of Sathir (53 SK mob, very high magic<br/>\nresist, very nasty) pops in the room.  Shaman gets slow resisted 5 times (we<br/>\nknow it will eventually stick).  I am mezzing the 2 prisoners.  Shaman is<br/>\nOOM, cleric LOM and Construct is ripping the SK a new one (I have no idea<br/>\nwhy it didnt agro on shaman, I guess SK went ballistic with spells).  We are<br/>\nin trouble, so we call for switch with me mezzing the construct (Sk said no<br/>\nDOT&#39;s on it) and them killing the prisoners.  Probably not a good idea, as I<br/>\nwas able to keep the construct locked up (taking every song pulse), but the<br/>\nSK and Monk die to the prisoners (everyone totally OOM now). But, I manage<br/>\nto hold the CoS mezzed long enough for another hand to pop.  I charm the<br/>\nhand and do a small circle charm kite (with rogue backstabbing away on the<br/>\nCoS, he does a TON of damage).  2 Sup heals (shaman got a slow to stick<br/>\nfinally. which is good since it summons) later, we have a dead COnstruct and<br/>\na half dead hand.  Which I have no trouble mezzing (and mezzing the curate<br/>\nwho wandered in) till the clerics meds up, rez&#39;s the 2 fallen, and the rez<br/>\neffects wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty cool encounter...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say without a doubt, the shamans&#39;s CHA buff (got me to 183 cha) made<br/>\nall the difference...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
