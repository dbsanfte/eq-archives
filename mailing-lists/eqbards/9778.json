Essentially, the -20[?] agility becomes something like a free hit for<br/>\nthe mob fighting you {especially if it drops you below an agility<br/>\nBreakpoint..my agility is 93, so the proc would drop me below 75, which means<br/>\nthat i personally would lose over 30 pts of AC...that is BAD}.  And, even if<br/>\nthis is exaggerated, it really is a poor weapon (based on dmg, Delay and<br/>\nweight). I would definitely be using the BLW and the Silvery War Axe (or the<br/>\ndirk and war axe).  Of course, you are high enough to go get yourself Demon<br/>\nClaws, which seem pretty spiffy to me.  or that fancy SharkJaw Cutlass in Kedge<br/>\nKeep...in a group w/higher lvls than you.
