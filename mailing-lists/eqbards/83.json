Ever switch cameras when you are running with your drums?

Perhaps some perverse enchanter has cast a twisted illusion upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us.  Does anyone know if perchance the great powers of magic may some day<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set this straight?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this will be fixed someday.  It has been broken for as long as I<br/>\n&gt; remember.  If they just made a model for holding a drum, that would be enough,<br/>\n&gt; the strumming motion SORT OF looks like a tapping motion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My guess is that it will be fixed someday, but who knows.  Drums USED to look<br/>\n&gt; like flutes, then they looked like chests, now they actually look like drums<br/>\n&gt; (in your inventory at least) so things are getting better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ever switch cameras when you are running with your drums?  Works best with Accelerando--you actually skate for about 30 feet while your playing your air guitar and headbanging!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On another topic, recently I attained the 7th circle of skill and after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saving and even sacrificing a bit of personal jewelery was able to purchase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the scroll for the Whistling Warsong of the 7th circle.  Imagine my dismay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when what I thought was newfound power had less effect though concentrated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on me than the old 1st circle song with which we all start has on me and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all others in my adventuring group.  Can anyone encourage me that perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some day my investment in the new song will be of some value?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The level 7 song is quite useful.  In addition to the changes you mention, it<br/>\n&gt; speeds up your attacks somewhat, a small difference at first, but it gets more<br/>\n&gt; noticeable later on.  The level 7 song is essentially a personal-only version<br/>\n&gt; of the level 10 song, Anthem de Arms.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tip: When you get to level 10, try &quot;juggling&quot; both songs at the same time.  You<br/>\n&gt; will notice a nice synergy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Likewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and valued application?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not really, it&#39;s sort of useless.  Sometimes when running very long distances,<br/>\n&gt; you will lose stamina.  Also, if you are without food and drink you may lose<br/>\n&gt; stamina at a very increased rate.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not too good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good for getting percussion up earlier on in the game--that&#39;s about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;** --------- End Original Message ----------- **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
