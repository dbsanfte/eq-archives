Had to ignore my girlfriend for hours on<br/>\n  end, so now I owe her big time. ;)  CT would have dropped sooner,<br/>\n  but we tried all this during times where most people had to sleep<br/>\n  or go to work the next day.  Thus, during the nighttime a small<br/>\n  group of people held the plane clear until others would arrive<br/>\n  after naps/work.  The combined efforts of 5 or 6 guilds paid off<br/>\n  around 10:00pm ET yesterday when the plane was finally cleared.<br/>\n  At 10:30pm ET Cazic Thule was dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Two days in the PoF teaches you a whole lot.  More than one short<br/>\n  12 hour burst, imo.  I logged 32 hours of the 48 it was held.  I<br/>\n  know the zone like the back of my hand now, thanks to Solidarity<br/>\n  of Vision and exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  24 people in the Cazic wave dropped him in less than 2 mins.<br/>\n  While we were buffing up, 4 mobs spawned in the zone, and thus<br/>\n  wave2 with 24 more people came to aid with the extras after the <br/>\n  God fell.<br/>\n<br/>\n  GMs were present during the slaying.  First ever on Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I got the privledge of being in CT GR1, the primary and initial<br/>\n  group which charged Cazic.  Only one member of my group perished,<br/>\n  100% resisted Panic.  Verses of Victory and Mystical Shielding<br/>\n  were played in battle.  Cazic Thule hit me once for 40 dmg and<br/>\n  once for 171 dmg.  He never touched me again, although I was<br/>\n  Gravity Fluxed about 3 times during the battle.  I did over 500<br/>\n  combined dmg, including 2 yk procs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I died about 6 times on the whole trip.  Two of those<br/>\n  times, I really couldn&#39;t do anything to help it if you get my<br/>\n  meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To be honest, we bent him over hard.  He didnt stand a chance.<br/>\n  Since I was the only bard there for 90% of the time, and since<br/>\n  I did breakin, I am now carrying the Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccalo.<br/>\n  Yeah it&#39;s useless, but it&#39;s God loot.  And the only one on this<br/>\n  server too ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since there was nothing else for a bard on the plane, a lot of<br/>\n  people owe me hateplane trips now ;)  And I&#39;ve already gotten<br/>\n  2 invites to go during the next week.  More imbrued here I come ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic Distortion, 50th god slayer.<br/>\n  League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
