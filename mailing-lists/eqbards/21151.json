I&#39;m only laughing because, should you ever get bored, hop on over to<br/>\nwww.solusekro.org...<br/>\nwhere we have TRIED to have such a system.  I agree that they can work<br/>\nremarkably well most of the time, but on Sol Ro, well, lets just say things<br/>\nhave become less than friendly many a time.  Problem is there are SO many<br/>\nguild that can do any plane that the reservation system would be 3 to 4<br/>\nMONTHS in advance (and this is for weeknights).  Most guilds do tend to go<br/>\nto a plane for a week though.  Our arguments usually are about one guild<br/>\n&quot;stealing&quot; the plane from another.  Its REALLY fun! (sarcasm intended) :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 55th Shaman and Master Raptor Killer<br/>\nTani 27th Blueberry<br/>\nParadigm - the - plane - stealing - guild (yes, sarcasm again)<br/>\nSolusek Ro <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 1:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some random PoF thoughts:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Innoruuk, we have a player based &quot;summit&quot; where the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;major&quot; guilds met<br/>\n&gt; and hashed out some basic rules and a reservation system for <br/>\n&gt; PoF and PoH<br/>\n&gt; (PoS is considered FFA [free for all] as are draggins.)  Guilds can<br/>\n&gt; &quot;reserve&quot; 2 dates (16 hour slots) for planes and the others <br/>\n&gt; respect their<br/>\n&gt; times See www.innoruuk.com and follow the link to the summit <br/>\n&gt; rules. There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; also a calendar there - you can see who has what booked when. <br/>\n&gt;  Weeekends get<br/>\n&gt; booked month&#39;s in advance. If a date is not booked, you and <br/>\n&gt; your pals can<br/>\n&gt; hop in and have a FFA night if you so desire.  This has <br/>\n&gt; worked remarkably<br/>\n&gt; well for us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last Friday, I heard through the grapevine that some folks <br/>\n&gt; had a total wipe<br/>\n&gt; out trying to break PoF at the south west wall (why they <br/>\n&gt; chose sw - I have<br/>\n&gt; no clue).  So, a bunch of our guild mustered forces and we <br/>\n&gt; went in to break<br/>\n&gt; the west wall and start them doing CR.  We had like 3 groups and were<br/>\n&gt; cutting down mobs nicely when the server decided to lag out for a good<br/>\n&gt; minute.  When it let up, we were all dead.  Heh, some of us were so<br/>\n&gt; confident of the break that we did not bother to bind <br/>\n&gt; anywhere close so it<br/>\n&gt; took a bit for us to get back to the TV and hop on in <br/>\n&gt; virtually naked.  We<br/>\n&gt; looted down to res corpses and finished the break.  Then came the most<br/>\n&gt; dangerous part: bringing the other guild&#39;s folks back in.  It <br/>\n&gt; can be a real<br/>\n&gt; nightmare when inexperienced people who you can&#39;t easily <br/>\n&gt; communicate with<br/>\n&gt; start running around in a panic.  Anyhow, we got them set and <br/>\n&gt; gated on out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We got a couple higher level folks on our server who like to <br/>\n&gt; brag about how<br/>\n&gt; few ppl they can break PoF with. Well, whoopity do, when you <br/>\n&gt; go in with 2<br/>\n&gt; groups of high level pet casters and fight blue mobs til it <br/>\n&gt; looks bad then<br/>\n&gt; gate out to the TV, rinse repeat. And their story is always <br/>\n&gt; the same: &quot;we<br/>\n&gt; cleared PoF with 10 ppl, except for the Temple, CT & Dracho <br/>\n&gt; and some misc<br/>\n&gt; roamers far from where we were...&quot;  All I can say is:  &quot;we clear PoF<br/>\n&gt; completely, kill Dracho, pull Temple w/o a sacrifical person, <br/>\n&gt; kill CT and<br/>\n&gt; are done by 1am on a weeknight.&quot;  Another guild has done it <br/>\n&gt; in like 3 hours.<br/>\n&gt; Having mid 50 to 60 level ppl makes all the difference.  When <br/>\n&gt; we were capped<br/>\n&gt; at 50, CT was dieing but it was 5am or later sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Minstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Greg Gillan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 11:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can see where Sartori is coming from, and while you may have taken<br/>\n&gt; offense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to his response, you shouldn&#39;t have.
