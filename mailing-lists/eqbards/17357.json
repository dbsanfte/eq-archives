There is no need for a Rogue to get an EBW.<br/>\nThey are far better off using the awesome piercing weapons that rogues get.<br/>\nGiving an EBW to a Rogue is silly.  I personally feel they should not be<br/>\nable to use the EBW.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore anyone wonders, yes, I play a rogue as well.  We get far superior<br/>\npierce items to the EBW within the game and the EBW is much better suited<br/>\nfor warriors, rangers and bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure Rogues get DW and DA.  But I strongly feel that any rogue that uses<br/>\nanything except pierce weapons needs to re-consider their class choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThieves do not run around lugging swords.  Nor do assassins.<br/>\n<br/>\nTryxie<br/>\nSpy, Fist of Innoruk<br/>\n<br/>\naka:<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur, Bard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure hope Verant takes that stupid line out of the EULA soon.
