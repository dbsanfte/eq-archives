This is my take on the<br/>\nbest player<br/>\nmade jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I<br/>\ncurrently wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nface:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>\nneck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>\near:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>\near:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>\nfinger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>\nfinger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, I wear a platinum black pearl ring (agi +6,<br/>\ndex +6) and a platinum fire emerald ring (dex +5, str<br/>\n+5). I can&#39;t charm yet, so my cha seems to not  be as<br/>\nimportant. I own a set of the gold star ruby rings,<br/>\nand electrum cats eye agate bracers, too. I only wear<br/>\nthem for selling and buying, right now. As far as<br/>\nbracers - I&#39;ve been blessed with a pair of serpentine<br/>\nbracers - (str +3, agi +9) they seem to help a lot. I<br/>\nzoned into Droon the other night, and dodged 4 arracks<br/>\nin a row, before zoning.<br/>\nAside from those differences, that&#39;s exactly what I<br/>\nwear. I&#39;ll post my stats at a later date.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble Entendre<br/>\nBard of 21 Songs<br/>\nExposing himself for a bind, somewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
