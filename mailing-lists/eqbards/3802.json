A P&P RPG was limited to just a few<br/>\npeople in a universe where everyone but them was an NPC.  A<br/>\nMMORPG is a virtual universe, and for the first time the<br/>\npossibility exists where the entire world *could* be run<br/>\nwithout any NPCs at all.  If killing monsters with friends is<br/>\nall you want, then you don&#39;t need something as extensive as UO<br/>\nor EQ, a non-persistent world like Diablo is sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the first MMORPG are going to emulate P&P RPGs, because<br/>\nthat&#39;s where all the previous experience with this type of<br/>\nthing has been.  But as players and developers start to get a<br/>\nbetter handle on just what is/isn&#39;t possible, we&#39;re going to<br/>\nstart getting closer and closer to the virtual realities that<br/>\nkeep getting hyped in the media.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just talking with some UO friends about the new UO<br/>\nserver that&#39;s going up and the de-emphasized role of NPC<br/>\nmerchants there.  One of them said the same thing you did - he<br/>\nworks enough in real life, he doesn&#39;t want to spend his<br/>\ngame-playing time &quot;working&quot; in a &quot;game&quot; to help someone<br/>\nmaintain an online merchant store.  Then it hit us - someone<br/>\nwho is sufficiently wealthy in real life could *pay* someone<br/>\nreal-life money to employ someone to *work* in a merchant<br/>\nstore in a &quot;game.&quot;  That is the paradigm shift most people<br/>\ndon&#39;t yet realize - we are moving from &quot;online game&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;virtual world,&quot; and the line between virtual and real is<br/>\nbeginning to blur.  We&#39;re already seeing it with people paying<br/>\nreal-life money for virtual items.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
