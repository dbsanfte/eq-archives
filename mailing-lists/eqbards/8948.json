Zytl, and the guards in Nektulos are pretty<br/>\nmuch immune to Chain, charm, and fear (at least to me in the<br/>\nupper 30s).  Gix and Dorn are slightly less resistant, but<br/>\nresist so often that it&#39;s generally a better idea to stick to<br/>\nself/party buffs.  About the same time, they also beefed up<br/>\nthe damage these guys do, or lowered the low-level damage cap.  <br/>\nI could easily solo Gix and Dorn at 30, but when the change<br/>\nwent in I couldn&#39;t solo either of them at 35.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>\n&gt; Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>\n&gt; on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>\n&gt; time I played my bard.

They<br/>\ndid make wisps in Befallen immune to chain/snare/root (or<br/>\npractically immune) several months ago, so I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nsurprised if they did the same to all wisps.  It would help<br/>\ncut down the number of high level players harvesting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce nice change I noticed is that Chain now stops runners if<br/>\nthey&#39;re below half health, which coincidently is when most<br/>\ngreens start to run.  If you&#39;ve got an annoying green runner,<br/>\nsnare (and the old Chain) will not stop it until it&#39;s at about<br/>\n25% health.  The only option used to be rooting it.  Now you<br/>\ncan Chain it.  It also makes Chain/Screech a much easier combo<br/>\nto use since your opponent will be immobile half the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
