If you go up to 5 attempts, the chance<br/>\nof getting 4 consecutive failures is 1 in 82,051.<br/>\n<br/>\natmpts  odds<br/>\n   4    1 in 160,000<br/>\n   5    1 in  82,051<br/>\n   6    1 in  55,172<br/>\n   7    1 in  41,558 <br/>\n   8    1 in  33,333<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, after 8, the permutations start to repeat, and<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t able to figure out a pattern to it.
