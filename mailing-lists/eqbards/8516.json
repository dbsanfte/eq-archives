What is gonna be a big","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-914973964\">Now you guys are on the right track!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have camped the bedroom which is about half way to the place where you<br/>\nneed to go from the zone.  What is gonna be a big problem for you is the<br/>\ninevitable trains.  It was a big problem for me and I was 30ish.  Be real<br/>\ncarefull about songs and drawing unwanted attention to your selves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPractice zoning (from lguk to uguk) or get a druid to go with u to do evacs<br/>\nand cast invis to undead (if druids can cast that).  Even so some of these<br/>\nmobs will see thru invis-to-undead.  So you will have to go there and see<br/>\nwhats happening and slip in behind a good group who is clearing the path.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut take this to heart - practice swimming & running to the zone as well as<br/>\nhave a druid or wiz friend along who can gate you out. Don&#39;t bother bringing<br/>\nany stuff on you like expensive weps or armor - you wont defeat anything<br/>\nthat attacks you (if u are 26 and under).  If you die and cant find your<br/>\ncorpse, petition a GM and hang around.  The walls are really weird and<br/>\ncorpses can be real hard to find - I been a lost corpse in there and needed<br/>\nGM to drag me out.  They understand it happens pretty much.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, I think there are 2 zones that are near to the bedroom (which is where<br/>\nyou will need to go thru to get in to where the assassin is.  One way in is<br/>\nfrom upper guk into a hallway tunnel that goes down to a water canal - swim<br/>\nto the right and thru an underwater passage then surface and you should be<br/>\nat the bedroom.  Hallways from the bedroom lead to where the assassin is (or<br/>\nwhere I am told he is - I have not ventured all the way there yet.)  So to<br/>\nzone out you&#39;d need to swim out thru tunnel then up and hit the right<br/>\nplatform (there are more than one) and run up the hallway and make a left<br/>\nand then up some more to hit the zone.  It&#39;s hard to do when a train has<br/>\nbeen pulled.  Been there, died there, got the tee shirt.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I looked at a map and see that there maybe another zone kinda nearby.<br/>\nIf you go to where the big crocks (I forget his name) in upper guk is camped<br/>\n- there is an underwater zone passage nearby.  I think that puts you in the<br/>\nsame canal that leads to the bedroom.  So you may want to explore coming in<br/>\nand out through that way instead of the traditional hallway tunnels. I know<br/>\nthat I am going to consider it for my next run to the zone because the<br/>\ntrains usually go towards the hallways after the pullers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo warranty nor suitabilty of porpose expressed or implied.
