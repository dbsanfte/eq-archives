Only rogues can do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is definitely not true.  Just this week, I was bored and <br/>\n&gt; decided to try <br/>\n&gt; to figure out how to use the lockpicks I had bought when I got the <br/>\n&gt; lockpicking skill.   I just happened to be in West Commons, <br/>\n&gt; so I headed on <br/>\n&gt; over to Befallen.  I finally discovered that you can pick ALL <br/>\n&gt; the Befallen <br/>\n&gt; locks by holding the lockpick on your cursor and <br/>\n&gt; left-clicking on the door.  <br/>\n&gt; I opened each door several times, never got a failure, but <br/>\n&gt; never got a skill <br/>\n&gt; raise either.  I don&#39;t remember if I had trained several <br/>\n&gt; points into the <br/>\n&gt; skill or not (I may have; I had a lot of training points to waste)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About the Hole entrance rock thing;  I went along on a Hole <br/>\n&gt; raid around <br/>\n&gt; level 40 (yeah, a little young, but you know how those <br/>\n&gt; caster&#39;s want their <br/>\n&gt; crack song... hehe).  Apparently you might not even need the <br/>\n&gt; locked rock <br/>\n&gt; picked as there is some space around it you may be able to <br/>\n&gt; swim through (of <br/>\n&gt; course SOMEONE has to let the big races in).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Interesting thing about the raid was that they brought along <br/>\n&gt; a few level 1-3 <br/>\n&gt; rogues along to sneak/hide their way around for corpse <br/>\n&gt; recovery...  Worked <br/>\n&gt; really well too!  =8^)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which brings up another question of mine...  It seemed that <br/>\n&gt; those level 1-3 <br/>\n&gt; rogues worked wonders with Sneak/Hide.  Now, being level 1-3 they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; sneak/hide skills can&#39;t be all that high (unless like Iksars <br/>\n&gt; that are born <br/>\n&gt; with Swimming skill of 100).  Now, how well does bard sneak/hide work <br/>\n&gt; compared with level 3 rogues?  Is there some technique to <br/>\n&gt; using sneak/hide?  <br/>\n&gt; I tried sneaking behind something in Kaesora the other day <br/>\n&gt; and the mob <br/>\n&gt; immediately aggroed on me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Olgwinn Pendragun<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 45 Missed Notes<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2000 22:01:05 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Bill Mann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Lock picking the Hole<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hmmm...
