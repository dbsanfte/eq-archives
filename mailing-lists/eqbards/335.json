Any information<br/>\n&gt;that I am able to unearth about the bard profession is<br/>\n&gt;public knowledge as far as I&#39;m concerned and I would be happy<br/>\n&gt;to have it repeated to any struggling or curious bard out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sheesh! Now this is a rant. Not much point in having a training <br/>\nacademy for bards and the making everything taught in class available <br/>\nfor free to the general public. I suppose you think that colleges <br/>\nshould do away with tuition and provide their classes to everyone for <br/>\nfree because you can research it yourself at the public library?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have said before, I have no connection with the Soerbairds and <br/>\nhave never even met one of their members. Their posts, however, are <br/>\ninformative, helpfull, well written, and never disparage others the <br/>\nway that you have sir!  All of my friends report that the Bards they <br/>\nhave met from this guild have been kind and helpfull to all and the <br/>\norganisation is a blessing to the realm of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you bashing a group like this that you know so little about? <br/>\nSave such lowly behaviour for those only fit to entertain drunkards <br/>\nand tavern wenches.<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
