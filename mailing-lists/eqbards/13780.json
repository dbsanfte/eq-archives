They have been trying to forage some for months and have had no<br/>\nluck.  They have been on the verge of giving up ever making Elven Wine.  It<br/>\nmust be incredibly rare since the druid has a forage of over 150 and hasn&#39;t<br/>\nfound any yet.  we assumed it would be like Nightfall giants and only showed<br/>\nup in the morning hours, Norrath time.

I know not all bards spend as much time running around asking people<br/>\n&gt;about quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I am<br/>\n&gt;fairly certain<br/>\n&gt;that if these really were in the game they would have been found<br/>\n&gt;by now.  GZ<br/>\n&gt;insisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard<br/>\n&gt;for them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities<br/>\n&gt;and the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any<br/>\n&gt;of those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or<br/>\n&gt;is this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant<br/>\n&gt;thinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?  Certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time<br/>\n&gt;they were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;especially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the<br/>\n&gt;scorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when<br/>\n&gt;they were<br/>\n&gt;not.  Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Free shipping through 1/31/2000 at Visualize.com<br/>\n&gt;where you&#39;ll find limited edition prints & photographs<br/>\n&gt;for your home, office, collection or gift-giving needs.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFree shipping through 1/31/2000 at Visualize.com<br/>\nwhere you&#39;ll find limited edition prints & photographs<br/>\nfor your home, office, collection or gift-giving needs.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
