In fact the<br/>\nmessage you get to tell you your shield is gone is &quot;you fell your<br/>\nagility return&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY problem with the PGT is that IF a mob hits you (and they will<br/>\nsince you have such poor agility) for more than the shield, the damage<br/>\ncomes thru. So if you are fighting any mob that can hit for more than<br/>\nthe ammount of the shield, they get one free hit, and then your agility<br/>\nreturns to normal<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n34th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
