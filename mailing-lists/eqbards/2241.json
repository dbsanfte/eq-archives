Not that I would ever play that way, I hated UO for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that one reason.  It&#39;s bad enough we got insta kill monsters, having to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worry about them, and other players attacking make it way to complicated for<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyways, if you PK someone, how much can you loot?  Everything?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Percentages, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also in a duel, if you win, what are you allowed to loot off the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player?  Items?  Money?  Nothing?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; the rules for a pk are the same as looting rules for a duel ,,<br/>\n&gt; you are able to loot anything that is equipped ,, or in an open inventory<br/>\n&gt; slot ,,, plus all the money on the corpse ,,,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This requires a little clarification, just so everyone doesn&#39;t get totally<br/>\nscared<br/>\naway from even trying Zek. :)  You can loot any *one* item a person has on<br/>\nthem, not including containers or anything stored in containers, plus you can<br/>\nloot all the money.  However, *anyone* can loot you for a few seconds after<br/>\na player kills you - whenever I&#39;m getting attacked by a mage much higher than<br/>\nme with no chance of escape, I tell my friends to stand right by me and loot me<br/>\nthe second I die - That way, the killer gets nothing, I lose nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLohengrin<br/>\n    -level 22 bard on Fennin Ro (semi-retired)<br/>\n    -level 16 bard on Rallos Zek (and still wearing patch)   :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
