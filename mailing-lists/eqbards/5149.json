Basically, Verant feels the need to alter the<br/>\ngame balance by nerfing from character classes. This may<br/>\nbe part of a larger effort to help the pure melee classes.<br/>\nIn any case, I think they have come to the conclusion that<br/>\nif they can do it silently, no one may notice or be<br/>\nable to prove it. This lets them avoid any headaches dealing<br/>\nwith pesky paying customers. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this stealth nerfing policy is that it gets<br/>\ncharacters killed who havent been notified of the changes and<br/>\nattempt to do something that has always succeeded in the past.<br/>\nAs paying customers, I believe that everyone has the right to<br/>\nbe informed of any substantive changes that affect the gameplay<br/>\nthat we all pay for. That is why I suggest thated a clause on<br/>\nstealth nerfing be placed in the Bard petition (Bards seem to<br/>\nhave been victimized a couple of times by this). On the other<br/>\nhand, it may be more worthwhile to start a separate petition<br/>\ndemanding that Verant publish and adhere to an Open Disclosure<br/>\nAgreement that commits them to release these types of changes<br/>\nimmediately upon implementing them. The &quot;knife in the dark&quot;<br/>\nstealth nerfing policy is very unprofessional. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Abraham Hardjana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 9:44 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Missed notes on songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 10 Aug 1999, Chris Kuenster (Entex) wrote:<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt; <br/>\n&gt; note on these songs.

It is my<br/>\npersonal opinion that Verant may be nerfing casters silently.  This is<br/>\nparticularly noticable on your earlier songs/spells where you very rarely<br/>\nfizzle. miss a not or are interrupted.  As of last night my level 17<br/>\nmagician on a full bar of mana in combat fizzle twice and was interrupted<br/>\nfive or six times while trying to cast shock of blades.  Please not that<br/>\nShock of Blades is a lvl 8 DD spell that I have been using since I got it.<br/>\nMy skill is maxed for my level.  So this may be a nerf for casters which I<br/>\nthink it might be,  I would not put it past Verant for nerfing something<br/>\nwithout telling us at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver Level 22 Bard<br/>\nAariel lvl 17 Magician<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
