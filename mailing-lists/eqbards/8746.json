Only problem I&#39;ve heard about is with the breastplate.  I&#39;m going<br/>\nto try the boots tonight probably (whoo hoo! got another lambent stone), so<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see what happens.  I&#39;m guessing its just the BP.<br/>\nGenni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the location, but I was<br/>\nable to deal with him.  He&#39;s in a seperate location from the bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 15, 1999 1:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I acquired the fixin&#39;s for two of the bard quests (arms and<br/>\nboots), but when I got to the Temple, another bard told me that all the<br/>\nbard quests were broken, according to a GM, and that nobody could find<br/>\nGenni, the person who makes the lambent gems, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid people have trouble making any of the pieces of armour besides the<br/>\npreviously mentioned breastplate problems? <br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
