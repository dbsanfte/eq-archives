Problem is,<br/>\nthe pieces duplicate.  Example, I have SS helm and Imbrued helm, SS arms and<br/>\nImbrued arm...etc.  What is considered &quot;better&quot;?  SS is real nice AC, but<br/>\nit&#39;s leaving my stats lacking.  Imbrued has some pretty good stats, but at<br/>\nthe cost of some AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have mentioned they carry 2 sets of armor.  I&#39;d rather not do that,<br/>\nsince I quickly get encumbered now as it is.  Currently, my &quot;fresh from the<br/>\nbank going out to do stuff&quot; weight is around 80/113.  Add some armor to<br/>\nthat, and I&#39;ll be starting out encumbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I really need to look at my shoulder, back, and waist slots.  My<br/>\nshoulders is still blood stained mantle, back is, I think decent, but don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what my options are, and my waist is the Straw Spun Belt.  Decent AC at<br/>\n10, but at 6 weight, I think it&#39;s too heavy.  I wouldn&#39;t mind options that I<br/>\ncould go and get myself solo, but I have a 51 shaman friend who can help.<br/>\nOh, I&#39;m 50, finally.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
