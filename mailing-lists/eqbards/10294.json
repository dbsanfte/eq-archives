I think that aspiring to get a certain level or a certain piece or<br/>\nset of armor, or whatever, is great - that&#39;s one of the reasons I play the<br/>\ngame. But another is to have fun ---- when people seem to get awfully worked<br/>\nup over a game... to the point of coming across rude to people, the game<br/>\nceases to be UN-fun (actually - the game has always been fun for me - its<br/>\nsome of the posts on this list that bother me). Anyway, that was what I was<br/>\nobjecting to... NOT whether a person really does deserve or not deserve<br/>\nthings etc.... Anyway - I have said enough on this (its a good thing that<br/>\npeople don&#39;t HAVE to agree on things or this thread will never end).<br/>\n<br/>\nBrangwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
