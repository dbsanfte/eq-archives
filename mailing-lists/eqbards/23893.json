It seemed that high end<br/>\nheals (better than greater heal) essentially had the taunt factor of greater<br/>\nheal.  My secondary is a cleric, and I can definitly say that superior was<br/>\nno where near the mega taunt I thought it would be.  Fortunatly for my<br/>\ncleric, he is lvl 37 so the change wont affect him for a long time.<br/>\nHOWEVER, for high clerics this could be devastating.  Can you imagine how<br/>\nhard dragons are going to be now?  Main tank group, the cleric essentially<br/>\nhas to start healing after about 10 seconds.  He is going to agro that<br/>\ndragon pretty damn quick, good bye mr cleric, good bye main tank group...<br/>\n<br/>\nWho requested DDD be improved?  Liek anyone is going to use it now that it<br/>\ndoes a few more points of damage...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
