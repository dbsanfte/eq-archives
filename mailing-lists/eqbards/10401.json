There&#39;s a phantom mana bug with Clarity, where<br/>\nsometimes the mana bar will appear to fill faster than your<br/>\nreal mana.  But when you cast a spell, the server sends the<br/>\nclient the correct amount, and that first spell seems to use a<br/>\nlot more mana than it should.  This is a client/server synch<br/>\nproblem of undetermined origin, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>\nour other songs could cause it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
