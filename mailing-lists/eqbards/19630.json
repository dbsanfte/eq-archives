Raid had two goals.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1797354093\">My guild plus an allied guild conducted a raid into Kaesora yesterday.  All<br/>\ntold we hade 15 people there with me the lowest at 37th level.  Raid had two<br/>\ngoals.  One, to get as many coins as possible for the bards in my guild.<br/>\nSecond, to kill Xalboz, the boss mob who spawns in the church.  Not everyone<br/>\ngot there at the same time so we marshalled at the library to wait for<br/>\neveryone to arrive.  All told we were there about an hour.  During that time<br/>\nit was nonstop pulling.  The fallen crypt raider spawned once during this<br/>\ntime.  Once everyone showed up, we moved to the lower parts of the dungeon<br/>\nen masse, killing everything in our way.  Once we broke the church area, two<br/>\ngroups remained at the bottom to take down Xalboz if he spawned.  My group<br/>\nmoved back up to the library to harvesy coins.  All told we were in Kaesora<br/>\nfor about six hours.  Unfortunately Xalboz never spawned.  However, the<br/>\nfallen crypt raider spawned a total of five times.  So every bard who<br/>\nattended the raid got a coin.  People who had been in Kaesora before were<br/>\nshocked that the raider spawned so often.  Guess the random number generator<br/>\ngod blessed us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike someone else mentioned in a previous post, Kaesora is a vastly<br/>\nunderused dungeon.  We were there for six hours during peak hours on a<br/>\nweekend.  During that entire time, only two other people (both 50+ level)<br/>\nentered into the zone.  Not certain why there weren&#39;t more 30-45 level<br/>\npeople in the zone.  Almost every mob in there conned blue to me at 37th<br/>\nlevel so its a great place to hunt for my level.  My guess is that the<br/>\nserver demographics for E&#39;ci is top heavy.  Probably not enough 30-45 level<br/>\nfolks around to cover all the dungeons designed for those levels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 7:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] My day in Kaesora was Re: MM Drum misadventure<br/>\nand Nostrolo Tamborine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the failed raider shows how incredibly flawed Verant&#39;s Random Number<br/>\nGenerator is.  Many things seem to go for hours (days?) without every<br/>\ntriggering; then the RNG goes nuts and pops many many times in a row.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nhad two people so far claim it was &quot;easy to get&quot; and three (counting me)<br/>\nreporting it difficult.  My good friend Darkfox who&#39;s on my server and this<br/>\nlist has also reported it&#39;s a &quot;Semi-Rare&quot; spawn...<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent about four hours there.  Hooked up with a group 50-55 who were after<br/>\nthe named guy at the Church to get a fang for a quest for a key to get into<br/>\nHowling Stones and to explore the zone.  They cleared the library - no<br/>\nfailed raider - no coin.  They had moved on by the time I got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after I joined them - another group came in to camp the library.<br/>\nThey were there a good three hours (by the time I moved on) maybe longer.<br/>\nUnless they were bullshitting me (which I doubt) - they didn&#39;t get a single<br/>\nFailed Raider - and nothing else dropped the coin.  They had a bard in their<br/>\ngroup - so I was hoping they&#39;d get two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt they were bullshitting.  If they did get a bunch and were hoarding<br/>\nthem for various reasons; they fairly got the room while my group was<br/>\ncamping elsewhere - why would they lie?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know the rules of random sampling - a 2 hour sample of a 30 minute<br/>\nspawn is 4 samples - you got a 50 pct hit.  Another group got six tried and<br/>\n0 pct hit... (Plus my groups sample - they cleared the room only once<br/>\nthough)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n43 Bard of Xegony<br/>\nStill Needing his Kaesora Coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 9:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: MM Drum misadventure and Nostrolo Tamborine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;cough&gt;bullshit&lt;cough&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKaesora is virtually deserted on Inny. Like I posted, been there 2 times<br/>\nnow.  First time, cleared into the Library and presto there was the coin<br/>\nguy.  Second time, cleared library, no coin, cleared the other stuff in the<br/>\narea, library re-spawned and we got the coin guy.  Less than 2 hours.  Might<br/>\nhave been the 3rd time to clear the Library but seems to be a fast 30 min<br/>\ntimer in that zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
