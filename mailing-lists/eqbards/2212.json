However the one<br/>\n&gt; thing we applied yesterday was the wonderful notion of who gets the kill.<br/>\n&gt; I honestly believe that there is a major flaw with the way loot/exp<br/>\n&gt; is awarded to groups.  While I was camped in the tower it never failed to<br/>\n&gt; amaze how the looting rights were assigned.  Many times the party I was in<br/>\n&gt; was able to ensure that we got the kill by strictly planning for our wiz<br/>\n&gt; to nuke only twice.  It did not matter what anyone else did, only that the<br/>\n&gt; wiz nuked twice.  That way he was about to do more damage than anyone<br/>\n&gt; person who attacked it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way it&#39;s designed.  I&#39;ve been giving it a lot of<br/>\nthought and think it&#39;d be better if it were changed to some<br/>\ncombination of damage done plus damage received.  The way it<br/>\nis now, nearly all the kills are going to spellcaster types,<br/>\nwhile all the downtime is going to the melee types.  One would<br/>\nthink that experience should be somewhat proportional to the<br/>\ndifficulty of the fight, and not awarded when you wait a bit<br/>\nfor someone else to take all the risk, stand up, fire a couple<br/>\nspells, loot, then sit down to med again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got some ideas on how to do this without making it too<br/>\nhard on the spellcasters, but need to run them by some friends<br/>\nfirst to check for holes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  This point was driven home when we had a level 24<br/>\n&gt; druid camping steal killing from my group (after I asked her to share the <br/>\n&gt; spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal kill.  Now my group in<br/>\n&gt; total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in total(she did about 300<br/>\n&gt; damage in total), yet she still got the kill from standing on the window<br/>\n&gt; sill.  Does this seem wrong to anyone?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A lot of people are asking that group damage be counted<br/>\ntogether, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really a good idea.  The way<br/>\nit is now, sure an individual can kill steal from a group; but<br/>\nat least anyone has a shot (in theory) at getting the kill.  <br/>\nNo one group can exclude others from a site.  If it were<br/>\nchanged to group damage, a group *could* exclude others from a<br/>\nsite, at least until an equivalent group started to compete<br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
