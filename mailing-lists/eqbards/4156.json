Now - all I can say is -<br/>\n&gt; make it fun for you.  Don&#39;t hate others because you don&#39;t think something is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;right&quot; about how they play the game.  It won&#39;t help you have more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another thing I don&#39;t understand.  The extent to which<br/>\nyou can give someone grief in this game (aside from kill<br/>\nstealing and training, which are bannable) is withholding<br/>\nhelp.  If someone decides not to help you because they think<br/>\nyou&#39;re twinked, how can you complain?  He was never under any<br/>\nobligation to help you in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Remember - if it can be done, it will be done.  You may think Verant should<br/>\n&gt; put in some limits on what level can have such and such stuffs.  But where<br/>\n&gt; is the fun in that? Much of the crazy things that happen - happen because<br/>\n&gt; there are so few rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, personally, I think the entire level based system is<br/>\nflawed...  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
