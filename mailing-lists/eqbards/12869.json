Enchanters have it rough, they are the groups master control<br/>\n&gt;   center.  They and the cleric control the groups movement, battle<br/>\n&gt;   actions, plans, etc.  The two bards would not assist each other and<br/>\n&gt;   insisted on fighting multiple enemies during the same encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I got some decent exp in Sol B Saturday and Sunday (6 bubbles, 1 death).  I did not have an enchanter in<br/>\nthe group, so whatever crowd control we had fell to me.  We had to handle multiple MOBs several times<br/>\n(four at once a couple of times, seven in succession a couple of times) and we did rather well, but we<br/>\ncould have done better.  How?  If the other players had LISTENED TO ME WHEN I SAID TO TARGET ONE MOB OR TO<br/>\n/ASSIST XYZ.  (sorry about the caps, Harm).  They didn&#39;t, probably because I&#39;m just too gosh-darned polite<br/>\nabout it.  If I had been dying as a result of this, I would have started to yell, myself.  If people<br/>\ncontinue to be clueless despite repeated polite nudgings, you have to HIT THEM ON THE HEAD.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 38 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
