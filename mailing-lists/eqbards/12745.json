Whenever I read a post that has<br/>\na lot of good info, i.e. the recent post listing all the dragon raid<br/>\nequipment, I file it away for future reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the big topics discussed recently is the feasibility of taking<br/>\ncharacters lower than high 40s-50 on dragon raids.  The primary concern is<br/>\nthat lower level characters are more susceptible to dragon fear spell and<br/>\nwill end up hurting the raid more than helping it because they could start a<br/>\ntrain while fleeing in fear. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m wondering is this: If a bard is participating in a dragon raid and<br/>\nis sitting down for the duration of the fight, what happens if they fail the<br/>\nresist check for the dragon fear spell?  Will they stand up and start<br/>\nrunning or will they remain sitting?  If you remain sitting even when you<br/>\nare feared, then that means any bard level 32+ could participate in a dragon<br/>\nraid.  On E&#39;ci, a lot of the raiding parties have a standard group of five<br/>\nclerics and one bard.  The mission of the five clerics is to continuously<br/>\ncast Stun on the dragon and cast res on anyone who dies.  The bard is there<br/>\nto sing mana song to pump up the clerics.  A lower level bard could perform<br/>\nthis duty while the higher level bards perform the resist buffing duties.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course its all a moot point if the dragon fear spell makes you stand up<br/>\nand start running.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
