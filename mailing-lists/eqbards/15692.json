This has been my complaint since the<br/>\nbeginning.  Many of the classes have someone at Verant who really &#39;cares&#39;<br/>\nabout the class.  As such, those classes are constantly observed for effects<br/>\nthat changes might have on them and what improvements might be needed for<br/>\nthem.  Unfortunately, it is all too apparent that bards have no such<br/>\nadvocate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Been playing my druid a bit more than usual of late due to frustration<br/>\nwith bard stuff.  Gads do druids have it easy, at least up to 25th level.<br/>\nI can&#39;t get over how much easier it is to play my druid than my bard.  If it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t for the fact that I really am much more of a bard at heart I&#39;d switch<br/>\nover permanently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 03, 2000 1:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Abashi responds to the lullaby thread<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee?
