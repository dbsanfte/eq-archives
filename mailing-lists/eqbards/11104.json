Sisters aren&#39;t bad - and there is the quest for their necklaces<br/>\ntoo....but they drop too much junk rust for my taste. The generic camp is<br/>\nmy all time favorite place to take low level friends to train. Pull them<br/>\nwith chain - let my newbie friends beat on them all day long. If we have to<br/>\nsuffer bard hate - I figure I might as well put it to good use - they<br/>\nSELDOM change targets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, there is always the pixie tower (now brownie outcasts have been added<br/>\nthere, no more picnics). Pixies are particularly annoying to me, maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nthat little noise they make when they die - anyway, they quite often drop<br/>\nlow level gemstones, and a backpackfull of those got my enchanter off to a<br/>\ngood start in her jewelcrafting. The harder pixies are casters - but good<br/>\nto hunt for xp and plat if you don&#39;t mind screwing a few factions along the<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBehind that, is the fairie village - just beautiful. Higher levels hunt<br/>\nthere, I&#39;ve never wanted to harm a fairy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrownies - I suggest not hunting at the brownie village unless you have a<br/>\nREAL good, REAL high level group - those little shits are just nasty nasty.<br/>\nGot a tell from a very old friend of mine one day - &#39;Can you help me find<br/>\nmy corpse&#39;.  Huh?  He was a 50th level cleric - what the heck killed him<br/>\nhere?  Brownies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMummies and Skeles can be found at their tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fay drake runs outside MM are nice, I don&#39;t mess with them either,<br/>\nbutterflies are just too pretty. Did see the big daddy charm someone once<br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere used to be a unicorn that could be seen regularly trotting between<br/>\nthe bandit camps - not seen it in forever tho, guess they took it out.<br/>\nBreathtaking animal - it would often stop and watch us hunt, like it knew<br/>\nwhat we were doing, then softly trot off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost dead center of the zone is the woodelf outpost - extremely<br/>\nconvienent to buy and sell without having to run to Felewith - and around<br/>\nthe corner from that is a lovely orc camp with a little something for<br/>\neveryone. Low levels can hunt the cents - higher levels go there to hunt<br/>\nthe legionnaire/chief that spawns in the middle tent. The leggo&#39;s spawn<br/>\ntime is just about perfect for a full manna dump and med - and by the time<br/>\nyou are hunting him, none of the rest are gonna mess with ya. Nother orc<br/>\ncamp there too, nothing particularly noteworthy - except it seldom has<br/>\nvisitors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have added a shadowed man camp - I steer well clear of that place.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of spiders for tailors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat zone is a rangers dream for named mobs - and they come in all levels<br/>\nand flavors. Brownie, pixie, fairy, wasp, spider.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd best of all - folks think it&#39;s an empty zone - just the way to get to<br/>\nMistmoore, muhahahaha.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:35 PM 12/2/99 PST, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;gnomes, bleh..=)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most of the ppl I see in lesser faydark are sitting outside of mistmoor <br/>\n&gt;having zoned.

I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt;&gt;friends<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Lesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Steamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;many people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>\n&gt;&gt;undead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
