Woohoo, a quest!  I was being total newbie dork last night.  Hailing every thing I could find!

I was being total newbie dork last night.  Hailing<br/>\nevery thing I could find!  I guess I missed his store, I will keep<br/>\nlooking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Not that I have found nor heard of. *  Anyhow, travel is not that hard.<br/>\n&gt; And if you go back for songs - train then.  Safefall you will want to have<br/>\n&gt; and prolly worth it to do some work to max it. Also, hide is one I<br/>\n&gt; neglected.  Trouble is that you need to con something to know if it worked<br/>\n&gt; and its capped low so its not as good (not even close) to rogues.  Might<br/>\n&gt; have been different if I knew how it worked and maxxed it early. Later on,<br/>\n&gt; you can buy your skills up as I probably will.  Although that wastes<br/>\n&gt; training points - hmm oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was so excited to get my first teleport, I forgot to ask the druid to<br/>\nwait a few minutes so I could run to HH and Quenos (I was in S Karana)<br/>\nto buy the lvl 23 and 25 songs and put them in the bank. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of firsts, Sunday was my first teleport, my first rez (After<br/>\nbragging about outrunning two avocets with 10hp left, I zone back in<br/>\nonly to pulse my heal song on my retreating cleric.  Whack!  Cleric<br/>\ndead!  Whack!  Elfson dead!).  My first trip to ROK, my first boat<br/>\nproblem ever! (amazing considering I have been playing since release,<br/>\nwhen the boats used to crash all the time).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Heh * And I was thinking that the agro radius is pretty small or there is<br/>\n&gt; some delay.  Stuff that should agro, I can run by fairly close.  Stuff that<br/>\n&gt; does agro, I can out run pretty easily.  I love my bard!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really?  Man those tall gnoll things (sarnaks?) agro me before I can see<br/>\nthem (I have to turn my clip plane to min since I am still having heavy<br/>\nfog video card problems).  Even the UD in Kithikor don&#39;t agro on me till<br/>\ni can see them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more question:  Does everyone get random faction hits in ROK?  The<br/>\nwhole time I was there I was getting random faction hits.  I assumed its<br/>\nwas a bard bug, but the rest of party was getting them too (not at the<br/>\nsame time, though)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
