I have been on 8 dragon runs since <br/>\nturning 40 (4 in 40th lvl).  I have not died in one since the 3rd one.  With <br/>\nElemental & Guardian rythmns up I rarely ever get feared, as a matter of <br/>\nfact the last time I was feared was on my 3rd 40th lvl raid. With resist <br/>\nbuffs & my dragon jewery kit I take minimal damage from the breath weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne secret I have learned is not to attack while twisting.  By doing this I <br/>\nrarely, if ever, get clawed and my group stays very much alive.  Matter of <br/>\nfact in one failed run, I was the LAST person standing at that point old <br/>\nNaga-pus decicded he wanted a bard snack :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy system is nearly identical to yours, what I do to weave is I count to 5 <br/>\nthen change songa.  This has worked very well for me in keeping both up.  On <br/>\na normal dragon run with buffs, dragon kit, & songs my CR/HR is 200+, this <br/>\nmakes a huge difference.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
