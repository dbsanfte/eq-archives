Training up my brass (excellent, finally) on the docks at night <br/>\nwhen finished adventuring....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am a pretty kicking battle bard in a group.  Fighting and twisting <br/>\nIm good at , have been gifted some good gear, armor and weapons ... good <br/>\nenough at least.  Have been gifted MM drums, SS boots and Gauntlet....  so <br/>\nI do just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, am weak on crowd control (no cha gear yet) and kiting.  Very weak on <br/>\nkiting...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I need to train kiting and will be doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGear wise, I&#39;m thinking about starting to try for lambent stuff.  Read a <br/>\nguide about being a low level and sneaking around and asking for no drops <br/>\nfrom high levels to get the gear, and considering that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel a high priority for me is a dark elf mask as well.  Has good cha <br/>\n(13) and dark elf should not be KOS with guards in OT...<br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t have good instruments other than drums.  Have a minotaur horn for <br/>\nwind, but no special lutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions, itemwise?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n31st lvl songster<br/>\nE.
