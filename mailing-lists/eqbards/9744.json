Assuming Verant is having a hard time<br/>\ntrying to figure out what our missing songs should be, what does that say<br/>\nabout the 50-75 level songs once the expansion comes out?  Who wants to bet<br/>\nthat we will have the same problem then as we do now? <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Throughout the history of this list, we have had several discussions on<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; missing songs.  Verant is unlikely to give us a new song that &quot;unbalances&quot;<br/>\n&gt; our class, i.e. a binding song.  Several people have come up with<br/>\n&gt; ideas/suggestions for our missing songs.  For the sake of discussion, what<br/>\n&gt; type of songs can they give us that will not upset the class balance.<br/>\n&gt; Lets<br/>\n&gt; classify our songs into categories.  The categories I can come up with<br/>\n&gt; are:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Stat buffing  \t\ti.e. Anthem, Warsong, Chant of Battle, etc.<br/>\n&gt; that raise a primary stat/attack bonuses<br/>\n&gt; 2) Resistance buffing \ti.e. rhythm and psalm series <br/>\n&gt; 3) Regeneration  \ti.e. Hymm, Jig, Mana song<br/>\n&gt; 4) Direct damage \ti.e. Bellow and Desperate Dirge<br/>\n&gt; 5) Damage over time \ti.e  DDD and CoD<br/>\n&gt; 6) Movement  \t\ti.e. Selos and teleport song<br/>\n&gt; 7) Target negative effect \ti.e. Chains, Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Charm,<br/>\n&gt; Largos<br/>\n&gt; 8) General \t\ti.e  invisibility, underwater breathing and<br/>\n&gt; levitation song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m only 26th level so I don&#39;t have much knowledge of the songs higher<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; 30th level.  As a result, there are probably a couple more categories to<br/>\n&gt; add.  These categories are enough though for the sake of discussion.  I<br/>\n&gt; would guess that Verant thinks they have pretty much covered all the bases<br/>\n&gt; in regards to our songs.  We have a wide variety of choices to select<br/>\n&gt; from.<br/>\n&gt; Assuming that Verant thinks our current songs provide everything we need,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; would imagine they are having a tough time deciding on what our missing<br/>\n&gt; songs should do.  Assuming that they don&#39;t want to give us any new<br/>\n&gt; abilities, the only option I see is to give us better versions or<br/>\n&gt; combinations of songs we already have.   For example, a better version of<br/>\n&gt; Hymn that heals more damage per tick.  Another possibility is a<br/>\n&gt; combination<br/>\n&gt; of Hymn and Jig to provide both health and stamina recovery.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So to sum it all up, I think it is more likely that our missing songs will<br/>\n&gt; be better versions/combos of our current songs versus songs that give us a<br/>\n&gt; new ability such as bind or gate.  What does everyone else think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant once replied to this - saying &quot;The new songs will be added once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something else is added&quot;..  As far as a bind song - if the info from JMC<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; former member of this list who allegedly had close contacts within the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; development group) It ain&#39;t ever gonna happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
