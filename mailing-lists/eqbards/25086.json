I also think that for pickup groups or<br/>\nfirst time groups communication is key.  In my case, all but our tank were a<br/>\nguild group. However, myself and another were alts playing with primes.  So<br/>\nthe chanter (prime chanter) did what he always did, and did not talk to me<br/>\nat all, assuming I was interchangeable with one of our guilds uber-bards<br/>\n(and I&#39;m not! lol).  In the end, if he would have even spoke up and<br/>\ncommunicated it woudl have helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he did just waht you talked about, AE stunned then tried messing.<br/>\nDidn&#39;t work lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 53rd BRD<br/>\nHalana, 60th SHM<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 26, 2001 7:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: My fingers are numb...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It takes a bit of coordination when a bard and enchanter are <br/>\n&gt; in the same<br/>\n&gt; group.  But if they work together and both know what the plan <br/>\n&gt; is, it can<br/>\n&gt; work great.  I have seen far too many enchanters commit <br/>\n&gt; suicide because they<br/>\n&gt; do not follow one simple rule:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Let the tanks - tank.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do believe that they panic when they see multiple mobs.  <br/>\n&gt; Crowd control is<br/>\n&gt; their job after all and things seem to be out of control.  <br/>\n&gt; Then they get a<br/>\n&gt; resist and a mobs turns on them. So, they AE stun.  Now even <br/>\n&gt; if they mez the<br/>\n&gt; mob that resisted, they have the other ones beating on them. <br/>\n&gt; This situation<br/>\n&gt; can go down hill fast.  I find that if they just wait and let <br/>\n&gt; the tanks<br/>\n&gt; tank, let the bard get one mezzed then they can pick another <br/>\n&gt; one to put to<br/>\n&gt; sleep.  Or, if they pick 1 mob to work on at a time. Attempt mez, if<br/>\n&gt; resisted, back away from the group, let the bard mez the mob <br/>\n&gt; attacking the<br/>\n&gt; chanter.  Also, working with a shaman and/or cleric is great <br/>\n&gt; too.  The sha<br/>\n&gt; can slow and the cleric can stun.  In any case,  the most <br/>\n&gt; important thing is<br/>\n&gt; not not AE stun, work one mob at a time and let the tanks - <br/>\n&gt; tank.  The bard<br/>\n&gt; can do the first mez on a mob and then tank it while the ench <br/>\n&gt; puts it to<br/>\n&gt; sleep long term - but again - you need to coordinate this <br/>\n&gt; plan ahead of<br/>\n&gt; time.  And I have been here done this - as bard, chanter and <br/>\n&gt; cleric - team<br/>\n&gt; work, works great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; 3 yellows to go, finally...<br/>\n&gt; The Pantheon<br/>\n&gt; Somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 12:02 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: My fingers are numb...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Makes me feel bad cuz i was trying to<br/>\n&gt; help our chanter mez like 6 things and I just made it so he <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t and we<br/>\n&gt; all died.  *shrug* guess you have to learn the hard way sometimes :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
