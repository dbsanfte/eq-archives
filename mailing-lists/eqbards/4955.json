Its basically<br/>\na form of cowardice in that they dont want to take the heat<br/>\nfor their actions. However, as paying customers I think it<br/>\nis reasonable for us to have the right to know what is being<br/>\ndone to the characters we are paying to play and have invested<br/>\nso much time into. Of course, other classes would benefit<br/>\nfrom such an official disclosure policy, Bards have been the<br/>\nhardest hit by this and as such it should be valid to include<br/>\nit in a Bard petition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, Brad and Smedley are always noting how much<br/>\nthought and debate go into every change to a class. They<br/>\nto agonize over every issue and debate it among the developers.<br/>\nTherefore, it should be very difficult for them to list these<br/>\nchanges since they should be well aware of them and be able<br/>\nto list them off the top of their heads since they spent so<br/>\nmany hours discussing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBaraden of TM, Prexus, Rodcet, and Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
