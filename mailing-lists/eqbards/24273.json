I was<br/>\noriginally annoyed that it didn&#39;t pull the MOB towards me in all cases, but once you get the hang of it,<br/>\nit&#39;s pretty handy.

Instead, it pushes it in the direction the Bard is facing (was very<br/>\n&gt; handy to learn &#39;cause we were in the tower, and it&#39;s easy to knock mobs off<br/>\n&gt; of it :).
