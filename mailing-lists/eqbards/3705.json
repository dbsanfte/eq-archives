Probably because their previous<br/>\ncharacter was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work<br/>\nhard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or deleted<br/>\ntheir previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>\nanyone else notice this begging?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the same thing in M59 when I played there.  Newbies begging for <br/>\nthings.  Very annoying.  When you suggest that they perhaps take the time <br/>\nthey are spending begging to go kill something and earn their way, they get <br/>\nhighly insulted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Lvl 30 ranger friend actually had one newbie DEMAND he give him his <br/>\narmor. (!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for twinking, I hate it.  Each of my characters earns their way.  I could <br/>\neasily get some very neat stuff for my bard with my lvl 30 druid, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  That, however, is a personal choice.  I know of many ppl who twink <br/>\ntheir lower level characters.  I suppose in some way, its been earned, since <br/>\nthe player did take the time to get it, rather than just having it handed to <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;See homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
