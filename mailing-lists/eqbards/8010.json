At that<br/>\nlevel you have Lament, but even better the Druid has Harmony. Harmony is<br/>\nlike an area effect Lament, but outdoor only. If you don&#39;t have a druid,<br/>\nLament all but the one or 2 you plan to pull as was mentioned. Make a<br/>\nbig circle around the camp if you have to to reach the back ones with<br/>\nlament. Make sure you get the &quot;looks sad&quot; message. Don&#39;t try to pull<br/>\npast lamented ones (this used to work but now will activate the<br/>\nlamented ones) If you get a resist and the whole camp comes, yell Run<br/>\nAway loudly. Done right, you should be able to amaze your party by<br/>\npulling singles out of a full camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
