It may be just part of an upcoming patch. Here&#39;s the message:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tzeetch<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; September 18th, 6:00pm<br/>\n&gt; -------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** Melee changes **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest.  These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them<br/>\n&gt; are working as of right now).  We wanted to make you aware of these<br/>\n&gt; changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need<br/>\n&gt; on them.  Please try these changes out and comment on results that you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We will be beginning our final analysis on casters in the very near<br/>\n&gt; future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Melee Tables *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how<br/>\n&gt; each class functions.  Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on<br/>\n&gt; the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table<br/>\n&gt; (one that has them doing more damage).  At 50th level warriors, rogues and<br/>\n&gt; rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not<br/>\n&gt; receive a new separate table.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two<br/>\n&gt; tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a<br/>\n&gt; more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple)<br/>\n&gt; penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off<br/>\n&gt; the melee table once they reach 51st level.  This should increase the<br/>\n&gt; combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage<br/>\n&gt; in combat than warriors.  To slightly improve their combat prowess they<br/>\n&gt; will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level<br/>\n&gt; and again at 60th level.  This will improve the combat ability of monks<br/>\n&gt; somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in<br/>\n&gt; toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level.  The<br/>\n&gt; rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their<br/>\n&gt; ability to backstab.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Two-Handed Weapons *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for<br/>\n&gt; them.  This tends to make those that rely on them most often<br/>\n&gt; (shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for<br/>\n&gt; their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50.  We&#39;d also like to see<br/>\n&gt; a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be<br/>\n&gt; nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for<br/>\n&gt; all classes once they reach 50th level.  There will be an increase in the<br/>\n&gt; minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder&#39;s level and<br/>\n&gt; delay of the weapon.  The higher level the character and the larger the<br/>\n&gt; delay, the bigger the bonus.  Obviously we&#39;re not going to give out exact<br/>\n&gt; numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when<br/>\n&gt; using two-handed weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very<br/>\n&gt; high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons.  The<br/>\n&gt; ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their<br/>\n&gt; two-handed counterparts.  We will, on a case by case basis, be improving<br/>\n&gt; many of the high-end two-handed weapons.  Because this is essentially a<br/>\n&gt; fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes<br/>\n&gt; retroactive (meaning you won&#39;t have to trade the items in or hunt for new<br/>\n&gt; ones, existing weapons will just change).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Rangers *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat<br/>\n&gt; than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned.<br/>\n&gt; Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range.  So we will be increasing<br/>\n&gt; the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level.  Exactly<br/>\n&gt; how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one<br/>\n&gt; point per level after 50.  We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Monks *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Monks will be getting triple attack.  This along with the improvement of<br/>\n&gt; their combat tables should place them about where we want them,<br/>\n&gt; combat-wise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Bards *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage<br/>\n&gt; physically of all the classes we&#39;re discussing.  However, with their lack<br/>\n&gt; of double attack they didn&#39;t meet even our intentions for their damage<br/>\n&gt; output.  We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon<br/>\n&gt; caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors.  This should<br/>\n&gt; place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended<br/>\n&gt; range without making them more effective than the knights at any given<br/>\n&gt; level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game.<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the<br/>\n&gt; Developer&#39;s Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them<br/>\n&gt; on the Test Server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we<br/>\n&gt; are testing.  These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may<br/>\n&gt; not be moved to Live Servers.  After all, that&#39;s the reason we&#39;re testing<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - The EverQuest Team<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Terrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?<br/>\n&gt; Donate cash, emergency relief information<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/\">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
