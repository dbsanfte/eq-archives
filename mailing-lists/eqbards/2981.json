It&#39;s useful, but as<br/>\none of the &quot;dextrously challenged&quot; I&#39;m also a bit disappointed<br/>\nsince it seems to violate the EQ designer&#39;s statement that &quot;This<br/>\nisn&#39;t a twitch game&quot;.  Esp, if what I&#39;m hearing about twisting<br/>\nbeing both needed at higher levels, and impacted by connect speed,<br/>\ngraphics, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nWould there be any support for trying to get a game mechanic to <br/>\nactually sing two songs at once w/o building up your &quot;Twitch <br/>\nreflexes&quot;.  Perhaps have it based on DEX and level?  I do really like<br/>\nmy Bard so far, but if what I&#39;m reading is true .. I&#39;ll be an L20 <br/>\nclass drop out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do software dev. for a living, and already have had to go to a track<br/>\nball to dodge carpal tunnel as I age (and play more computer games for<br/>\nleisure). :)<br/>\n<br/>\nStarling<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW. My data point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pentium II 350 MHz<br/>\n-224 MB 100 MHz SDRAM (I dual boot and need this<br/>\nwhen running NT and doing development work)<br/>\n-Diamond Permedia 2, 8MB AGP<br/>\n-56K USRobotics Modem usually get 33.3 off my ISP<br/>\n-Win98, Registry regularly cleaned up, disks<br/>\n defrag&#39;ed etc ... <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually run in 1024x768 no trouble.  <br/>\nMain problem is in-game lag in crowded zones, and<br/>\na DNS lag issue with my ISP.<br/>\nIf I do suddenly run into a zone with trouble, I usually<br/>\nF10 back to the small view window, rather than the transparent<br/>\noverhead view.  Its faster than changing the res.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my Bard to do twisting I NEED to be in the F10 view<br/>\nwith the small window at 1024x768 or the graphics refresh on the <br/>\nspell buttons is too slow.  I can twist 2 easily, should be able to do<br/>\n3 when my songs have more staying power.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy graphics card is no longer that amazing, but with the expected life<br/>\ntime of this system at about 1 year, I can&#39;t see replacing it now. But<br/>\nif it becomes the kid&#39;s game system (as its predecessor did) when I have<br/>\nto upgrade, maybe its not such a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Celeron 300A overclocked to 463 MHz (whee)<br/>\n&gt;128 MB SDRAM<br/>\n&gt;Riva TNT, 16M, AGP<br/>\n&gt;Modem that connects 28000 max, as low as 19200 sometimes (really)<br/>\n&gt;Running at 800x600 (1024x768 is a tad slow)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can easily twist 3 songs, and often 4 (Anthem + Bellow x 3)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not 24th yet, so no extra sparklies... maybe framerate will tank<br/>\n&gt;then? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
