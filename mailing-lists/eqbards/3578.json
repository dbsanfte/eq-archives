He told me that &quot;I screwed up&quot; by not dumping all xtra points into<br/>\nstr - when I asked him if that bronze wasn&#39;t a bit heavy for a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI informed him that no, str wasn&#39;t gonna be our primary stat - he was still<br/>\nclueless. I&#39;m sure he thinks he can solo tank - also sure he&#39;ll say<br/>\n&#39;barding sucks&#39; in just a few more levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatched him run around most of the night, not sure what level he was - but<br/>\nhe was still runnin from cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess his idea of a bard is a tank that can sing *sigh*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day - this lvl 1 runs up to me, basically DEMANDS I find her<br/>\ncorpse (it was in the newbie zone, nearly in plain sight) - I almost choked<br/>\nwhen I saw her putting on a complete set of steel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I have a vicious streak - but it does my heart good to see both their<br/>\nbodies on the ground (something that happens with a LOT more regularity<br/>\nthan I would have suspected).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see anon not be available to anyone under lvl 10 or so - would<br/>\nshow these guys up for what they really are.  *MY* idea of helping out a<br/>\nnew character is patchwork, or *gasp* leather, hahaha - silly me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:41 AM 7/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Hello all,          I&#39;ve heard many Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve  ever actually noticed anyone wearing it.       He said a  friend gave<br/>\n&gt;it to him, nice gift.      No sooner had his new character spawned at the<br/>\n&gt;Freeport  gates than some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked<br/>\n&gt;if he wanted a  2H instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could<br/>\n&gt;tell him how to say  thank you.     I  guess I&#39;m just bent because my bank<br/>\n&gt;account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly  so there&#39;s no way I could buy<br/>\n&gt;plate or any other really cool items  yet.
