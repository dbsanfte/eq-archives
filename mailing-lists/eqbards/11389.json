He can&#39;t recall offline if it&#39;s No Drop. I figure it is, being a quest item, but thought I&#39;d ask. He didn&#39;t reply when I asked him casually if he&#39;d get an Opoline Helm for me, too. *g*  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\nMeandering Maestro, almost 22<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. If I get it, that will make one component of every lambent piece. Already have Shin items, Griffene Charm, both Runes of the One Eye, and the breastplate. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be nearly this far along yet, Harmonic not withstanding! So, if you&#39;re a young bard, what are you waiting for? Go for it!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
