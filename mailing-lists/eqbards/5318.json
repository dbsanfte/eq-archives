I use a Crystalline sword 11/38 on melee mobs, and a Claw on<br/>\ncasters. I have a line on a Silvery Scimitar 6/22, and my off hand weapon is<br/>\nalmost always a PGT. I may get a Ykesha this weekend if the Lord decides to<br/>\ndrop one, but I am always looking for high damage short delay options. The<br/>\nWrithing staff is interesting, but like the various crystal staffs sort of a<br/>\nnovelty weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:randy@...\">randy@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:randy@...\">randy@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 10:38 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:randy@...\">randy@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a lvl 30 Bard on Fennin Ro with the following stats. Str 115, Sta 86,<br/>\nAgi 132, Dex 151, Wis 60, Int 79, Cha 90, HP 699, AC 559. Yes I&#39;m a bit<br/>\ntwinked.. anyhow.  My one hand blunt is maxed, as is my one hand slash, and<br/>\ndual weild.  My piercing is only at 60 or so (need to work on that one).<br/>\nThe following info is when fighting aviak&#39;s and Centaur&#39;s in South Karana. I<br/>\nalso always have my PGT in my left hand (good for constency for this test).<br/>\nI am solo&#39;ng in these tests, with melee and bellow being my primary mode,<br/>\noccasionally with the claw I&#39;ll throw in JWW, but not constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStaff of Writhing:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeavy weapon, large stamina drain, yes it proc&#39;s, but only 2-3 times a<br/>\nbattle. I do not notice any higher resist with the -9 cha loss.  Overall, a<br/>\nneat looking weapon, but not especially effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBladed Thulian Claw:<br/>\n<br/>\nLight, fast, low damage.  The speed is awesome, and it seems to me that my<br/>\ndual weild goes off more often with this weapon, which may explain why I do<br/>\nbetter with this than my Staff of Writhing.  Low stamina loss, which is<br/>\nimportant if all of a sudden you have another spawn in front of you before<br/>\nyou get a chance to rest. Maybe its because the dual weild goes off more<br/>\noften, but it also seems that my pgt procs more often when using this<br/>\nweapon.  I notice that the battles seem longer, but I usually end up with<br/>\nmore health, and more stamina at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRuned Falcion:<br/>\n<br/>\nNice weapon, imho better than the claw.  Slower than the claw but more than<br/>\ntwice the damage (11 vs. 5) same weight as the claw, but the battles seem to<br/>\nbe over faster.  Dual weild doesn&#39;t go off as much, my pgt still proc&#39;s<br/>\nthough (less maybe because its a shorter battle).  Overall a better weapon<br/>\nthan either the staff, or the claw.  (Note: I am fighting non-casters, the<br/>\nclaw may be better on casters in order to interupt them)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had focused on boosting my dex, in order to make the staff proc more<br/>\noften, but with 151 dex (with no song, or cast buff&#39;s) it really didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto help all that much, a little, but its not like the staff casts its 48p DD<br/>\nevery other blow or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a real world test, I used no calculator to figure stats, or<br/>\ndetermine ratio&#39;s etc.. results may vary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCoalin Minnesinger<br/>\n<br/>\nBard of the 30th Song (stuck there forever it seems)<br/>\n<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members, don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist!<br/>\nJoin our community member news update  <br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;here&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
