They can<br/>\nhit them with a Raincaller and 150 ranger arrows.  We&#39;ve also had the blades<br/>\ncome by aggroing a mob too close Dojorn&#39;s island.  <br/>\nWe haven&#39;t however been able to get Dojorn to leave his island.  Probably<br/>\nsome nerf by Verant so that people don&#39;t pull him.  Of course we could just<br/>\ngo down to island one and take the portal back up to his island, but this<br/>\ncosts a lot of time and money, especially if we want to go back to gorgalosk<br/>\nisland afterwards.  Would Verant nerf Dojorn so that he can only be killed<br/>\nby spending a lot of money?  Prolly.  Him not leaving his island certainly<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t accomplish anything else.  Doesn&#39;t make him harder to kill, just<br/>\nmore time consuming and expensive.  Verant loves money-sinks and lots of<br/>\ndowntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interested me was Rokenn mentioning some trick that a paladin had for<br/>\nmaking the Blades leave Dojorn&#39;s island.  Just wondering if this is<br/>\nsomething that can be done from Dojorn&#39;s island, or if it also requires<br/>\ngoing up to Gorgalosk island first.  If we only need to go to Dojorn&#39;s, we<br/>\ncould go up any night of the week and kill him at relatively little cost in<br/>\nplatinum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2000 11:25 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question for Rokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got bladestorm(s?) by  pulling I-3 mobs too close to their social (agro)<br/>\nrange.
