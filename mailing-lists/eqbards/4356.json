Maybe something about dwarves and elves attract a younger, <br/>\nmore immature gamer.  So I spend most of my time elsewhere despite the great <br/>\ndungeons  there.  Still have the occasional KS problems but nowhere near as bad <br/>\nas near The Fay.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne obvious solution is grouping.  Find an enchanter,   They have this great <br/>\nspell that wipes the memory of the mob just before it dies.  They can be wicked <br/>\nkill stealers and everytime it happens to us she teaches them a painful lesson.<br/>\nGrouping is best, more fun and more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nBujold <br/>\n18th lvl bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Magical Gloves?

Try all different hours of the day.<br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be embarrassed to admit how often I&#39;m online.. Heh. I&#39;m usually online <br/>\nfrom 5p-1a EST during the week and then 24/7 on the weekends. (*ahem* <br/>\nbelieve it or not, I do have a life mixed in there.. hehe) People just <br/>\naren&#39;t selling them anymore.<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; option is a combine dagger or a crookstinger.  A dirk is <br/>\n&gt; good - my first choice but not for 75pp - you can get 2 <br/>\n&gt; combine daggers for that and have change for milk<br/>\n&gt; and muffins!<br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I bought a Combine Longsword to take care of my magical mob requirements. I <br/>\nwas just looking for the Dirk for the day when I blessedly get dual wield. <br/>\nAs it is now I&#39;ve got a Dwarven Axe sitting in the bank that I&#39;ll use since <br/>\nit&#39;s really fast.<br/>\n     <br/>\nAnd on a different subject and trying to keep it Bard related: What can a <br/>\nbard do (if anything) when he/she is being constantly robbed of his/her <br/>\nkills by magic users? For example.. I&#39;m sitting on the training hill in <br/>\nCrushbone just wailing away having a good ol&#39; time - nobody else is up there <br/>\n(that I can see) and I&#39;m just plugging away at Centurions.. Lo&#39; and behold <br/>\nthe Trainer spawns.. I start whacking away at him thinking great, real <br/>\nexperience now - and *zap* *bang* *boosh* and the trainer is running to a <br/>\nmagic user that was hiding himself over the edge of the hill. Aparently (now <br/>\nI know) the Trainer carries the Shiney Brass Shield sometimes.. I mutter my <br/>\nprofanities and the other person leaves (so I thought). Same thing happens <br/>\nagain.. And again.. I finally get sick of it and leave the hill. Is there <br/>\nnothing that as a Bard we can do to prevent this sort of thing? I mean, I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t camping for the shield (didnt even really know about it at first) but <br/>\nmy kills were being stolen. I&#39;ve camped before and gladly take turns with <br/>\nany other groups that are present - but it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s <br/>\nsuch rampant stealing like this and nothing that can be done about it. Whine <br/>\nto Verrant? I doubt they&#39;d do anything.. Duel the caster? Bah, he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\naccept. And neither of us were PvP&#39;s. Are we as Bard&#39;s just stuck to the <br/>\nwhims of Magic users?<br/>\n     <br/>\nI won&#39;t even get into the massive and unbelievable amount of KS&#39;ing on the <br/>\nnew Brell Serillis server.. keeeeripes man. 100 people outside of Felwithe <br/>\ngoing after the same MOB&#39;s.. I gave up on that server quickly.<br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\nIf you join ONElist s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
