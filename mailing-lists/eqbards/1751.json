The only thing that might be called a bug about<br/>\nit, is if you are already fighting the same monster and you hit your assist hotkey<br/>\nagain, you may end up targetting the player you meant to assist, but then, that<br/>\nwould really be an operator error anyway (since you would be assisting the mob that<br/>\nis fighting the player in your party, assist is actually working as it should).  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think Assist is buggy.  Probably people are using it wrong.  If you have a<br/>\nmain tank that is usually in your party, you can make a hotkey just for that<br/>\ncharacter (/assist tank).  That saves time targeting them and reduces the liklihood<br/>\nof errors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be very<br/>\n&gt; very buggy.  For some reason, /assist will often have them or their pets attack<br/>\n&gt; completely different mobs, and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 5,000!
