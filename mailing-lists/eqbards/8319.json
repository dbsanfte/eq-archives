As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>\n&gt; started casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>\n&gt; successfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>\n&gt; could move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>\n&gt; you further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>\n&gt; affected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mobs don&#39;t care about line of sight.

Players get two range checks -<br/>\none when casting the spell, another when the spell fires.  If<br/>\neither fails, you get the &quot;not in range&quot; message.  I think<br/>\nmobs only get the first check, and if it starts casting a<br/>\nspell at you, it will hit you no matter where you are.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nrun away from casting mobs with Accelerando and a drum in<br/>\noutdoor zones.  Sometimes I make a turn which lets them catch<br/>\nup enough to get into spellcasting range.  When I see that<br/>\nmessage, I straighten out again, and given the time before the<br/>\nspell hits, I must&#39;ve run far out of range.  Yet I&#39;m always<br/>\nhit by the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
