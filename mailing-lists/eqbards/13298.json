Any group, good or bad, can handle the easy pulls.  So you get a<br/>\nbad pull.  If you know how to play a bard properly and you are in a bad<br/>\ngroup, you chances of dying increase because you will draw too much<br/>\nattention.  The other option is to not play your bard to his maximum<br/>\ncapability until you gauge the quality of the group.  So you get a bad pull.<br/>\nIf you played your bard to his maximum capability, there is a chance your<br/>\nentire party can survive the fight.  But you don&#39;t want to die so you play<br/>\nit safe and not sing the songs you know will draw everything to your<br/>\nattention.  Now you risk pissing the other people in your party off because<br/>\nyou weren&#39;t giving 100% effort in the fight.  Either way you end getting the<br/>\nshort end of the stick.  For me personally, I always play my bard to the<br/>\nbest of his capabilities. Therefore, the only way to avoid the situation is<br/>\nto play in a regular group or not let it bother you when you die.  Since my<br/>\ntime constraint wont allow me to play with a regular group, I have just<br/>\naccepted the other option as the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I know I&#39;m addicted to having fun with other people.  Unfortunately I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been in so many bad groups lately that hasn&#39;t translated into playing as<br/>\n&gt; much EQ as I used to.  I think that&#39;s the biggest drawback to the bard<br/>\n&gt; class.  When you get in a bad group, its the bard that pays the price.  At<br/>\n&gt; least that&#39;s been my experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
