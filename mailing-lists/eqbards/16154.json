Has anyone else ever played any game in which you had to<br/>\nbuy spells with absolutely no clue as to what they did without information<br/>\nfrom outside the game?  I know I have not.  Our spells don&#39;t even follow the<br/>\ncolor coding correctly as evidenced by the fact that CoD and DDD have the<br/>\nsame characteristics and yet are different colors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine playing this game without the net for a moment.  It would be<br/>\nimpossible!  Imagine how ridiculous you&#39;d feel running around trying a new<br/>\nspell on everything in sight to see what it did.  This is about as stupid as<br/>\nmy other favorite pet peeve.  No MPC has any idea when the boat will arrive<br/>\nand they don&#39;t follow any kind of schedule based on game time.  In fact as<br/>\nof last nite, the stupid boats on E&#39;ci were so out of whack that<br/>\nStormbreaker was leaving Freeport only 5 minutes behind Siren&#39;s Bane.  Not<br/>\nmuch point in having 2 boats if you can&#39;t be bothered to make sure they stay<br/>\nevenly spaced.  Just two more examples of Verant&#39;s penchant for lazy coding.<br/>\nDespite all their protests to the contrary, it seems pretty apparent the<br/>\n&#39;A-team&#39; who did much of the original coding is working on the expansion,<br/>\nand the game people are paying for has been relegated to the &#39;B-team&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

Crawford&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me, am I the only one that thinks it&#39;s absolutely rediculous that<br/>\nVerant does not include a brief description of what songs/spells do when you<br/>\nright click on the scroll or their icon in your book?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, seriously.  A bard would spend years studdying a song to use in<br/>\ntheir travels and then not know what it does until they use it a few dozen<br/>\ntimes??  A wizard would research and find components then have to combine<br/>\nthem in the right order and not know what the spell did?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it just me or does the &quot;reality&quot; get a bit suspended there?  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying we need something like &quot;This song does XYZ dmg over XYZ minutes&quot; but<br/>\na brief description like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The song will dammage your oponent slowly over time due to the discordant<br/>\ntones as well as lowering his armor class due to the distraction it is<br/>\ncausing him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each song/spell this would be invaluable and would really not be all<br/>\nthat hard to implement.  All they&#39;d need to do is spend an hour or 2 to do<br/>\nthis for every spell/song in the game.  Hell, given about 20-30 minutes I<br/>\ncould do it for all the bard songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never understood why we&#39;re kept in the dark as to what spells/songs do<br/>\nonce we have them.  I could understand not having it on the spell sheet<br/>\nbefore it&#39;s in the book, but once you&#39;ve scribed it the book should have the<br/>\ndescription.

My four song combo of choice was DDD,<br/>\n&gt; CoD, Hymn and then a Bellow.  I found it was adequate, but that I would go<br/>\n&gt; back to the three song combo when things got hairy.  I sadly underutilized<br/>\n&gt; Hymn (and then Chains) for a long time, until I figured out how potent<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; could be.  (It probably all dates back to that bard who ridiculed me for<br/>\n&gt; using the all-song combo when I was 22 and she was 28 because she &quot;didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like it&quot;...her combo of choice was hymn, chains and anthem with weapons.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Btw, your posts are making me seriously consider making another bard on my<br/>\n&gt; server (or another one, I don&#39;t care) and working him up to crags again :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note, my beloved ogre warrior is now 19 and desperately seeking<br/>\n&gt; his surname.
