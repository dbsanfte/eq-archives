I have seen numerous situations<br/>\nwhere mobs picked on the lowest level character in the group, regardless of<br/>\nwhat the others characters are doing to it.  Doesn&#39;t happen all the time but<br/>\nit does happen.  In the situation last night, bard hate just made the matter<br/>\nworse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThree of the classes you were with can Stun mobs.  John Kim posted the other<br/>\nday of the importance of the Stun spell in reducing mob damage to the party.<br/>\nWere they Stunning frequently? If not then that may also help explain why<br/>\nyou bore the brunt of the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW adding a real tank to the party composition you listed should be enough<br/>\nfor you to get the obsidian shard in Sol A which you posted earlier you<br/>\nwanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Last night my group was 34 cleric, 33 enchanter, 27 wizard, 26 shaman and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; still took almost 50% of the damage.  The wizard was the only one able to<br/>\n&gt; get mobs of me and with her low hp&#39;s can hardly afford to do so.  Tanking<br/>\n&gt; with a 26th lvl troll shaman was kinda cool, especially since the dwarf<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; the tallest among us, but painful.  Fortunately the cleric was easily up<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the healing task and even joked about how bards made his job too easy,<br/>\n&gt; generally only one hp bar to watch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
