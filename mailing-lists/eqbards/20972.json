I&#39;d kill to get my hands on a rubi bp<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Najena was a zoo over the weekend.  It looked like most of the server&#39;s<br/>\npost-50 retirees had come out of retirement to own the mid 20/30 Froglok<br/>\nmobs.  Most spawns were double and triple camped and this little &#39;event&#39;<br/>\nseemed to bring out the worst in people - there was a lot of KSing, farming<br/>\nand ninja-looting going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe place was so well camped, a level 1 newbie could have walked through the<br/>\nentire zone with carefree audacity, safe in the knowledge that should<br/>\nanything aggro on him/her, the aggressor would have been swiftly dispatched<br/>\nby at least 6 high level players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, one of the GMs popped on to have a word with the masses... I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure what was said, because the person I asked looted Rubi gloves and<br/>\nran off before his group could roll for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAFAIK, the breastplate doesn&#39;t drop.  I did see people with greaves, gloves<br/>\nand helm.  I think boots and bracers were also dropping, but I can&#39;t be<br/>\nsure.  People were having most luck from the named spawns in areas such as<br/>\nthe Bonecracker and Captain&#39;s rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did I get for my 2-3 hours down there?  Two bunches of Whore&#39;s bane and<br/>\na lump of clay. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha<br/>\n27th Bard of Bertoxxulous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
