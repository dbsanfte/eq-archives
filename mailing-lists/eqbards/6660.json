In my testings, I have tried<br/>\nthis by just clicking on the song button.  I get the static pulse message but<br/>\nnothing else.  What I have not tried is targetting myself (hitting F1 key or<br/>\nclick on my name) and then hitting the song button.  Has anyone tried playing<br/>\nthis song with targetting themselves first?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other possibility.  Are we 100% certain that the song is supposed to remove<br/>\nnegative buffs from us?  What if the song removes positive buffs from a mob?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a last resort, we could always send a message to Geoffrey Zatkin and try to<br/>\nget clarification from him for both songs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, if these possibilities have already been covered then my bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; i still haven&#39;t tried the level 40 song since it was fixed, keep forgetting.<br/>\n&gt; i have heard that it is a single target dispel magic song, removing one icon<br/>\n&gt; per tick.  perhaps the level 22 song is a preventative song, meaning you<br/>\n&gt; must be playing it to avoid getting charmed, as opposed to playing it after<br/>\n&gt; a group member is charmed.  maybe get two bards (one level 22+ the other<br/>\n&gt; level 28+) and one other person together.  have the level 22+ bard and 3rd<br/>\n&gt; person group, and have the level 28+ bard alone and try to charm both people<br/>\n&gt; in the group while the 22+ bard sings level 22 disenchanting melody and see<br/>\n&gt; if charm works.  i&#39;m either too lazy or more likely will forget to try this<br/>\n&gt; =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, Level 23 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Tyria, Level 17 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greeting fellow Bards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that the Antimagic Song was an AOE <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or party only <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that prevented harmful spells from being cast on the party by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; any attacking <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mobs. I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karanas Ogre <br/>\n&gt; &gt; camp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to prevent <br/>\n&gt; &gt; members from being charmed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tried Disenchant last night after a group member was rez&#39;ed <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it did not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dispell the Rez effect. It was effecting my whole party but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; no one reported <br/>\n&gt; &gt; losing any buffs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it possible the Disenchanting song and the Antimagic song <br/>\n&gt; &gt; effects have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; been completely switched in the multitude of patches and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tweaks/nerfs since <br/>\n&gt; &gt; beta?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just wondering out Loud,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Knight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Excalibur, (Xegony L33)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
