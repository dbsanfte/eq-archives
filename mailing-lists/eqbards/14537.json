Pull something like this with chains - or hit<br/>\nlullaby - and your lowbie friends will love you to death. I used to do this<br/>\nwith bandits in lesser fay all the time (once they can&#39;t hit ya - they<br/>\ncan&#39;t hurt ya) while the little bugs were wackin at their backsides. Took<br/>\nnext to forever, but the xp to low level folks was most excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:39 PM 2/4/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was showing off for some newbie friends once at the chessboard in BB and I<br/>\n&gt;charmed a skeletal knight and told it to sit down.

Keep in mind I have not struck the skeleton one, just charmed<br/>\n&gt;it.  The fight lasted about a minute and the skeleton never stopped hitting<br/>\n&gt;me the whole time...it had absolutely no concern whatsoever that there were<br/>\n&gt;two con green PCs standing behind it killing it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Hmmmmm....&quot; I thought, and I helped my two friends get to their next level<br/>\n&gt;killing one yellow after another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think charm has mem blur, doesn&#39;t it? I once saved myself from a KSing<br/>\n&gt;nuker in Highkeep by charming the gobbie he was trying to nuke while I was<br/>\n&gt;meleeing.  Not knowing what was going on  he continued to blow mana on it,<br/>\n&gt;then I let it break charm and finished it off. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
