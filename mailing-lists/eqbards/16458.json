Frankly I fight in groups without a druid or<br/>\nranger fairly regularly.  Besides, there are a bazillion people out there<br/>\nwho don&#39;t know how to play their class well.  They don&#39;t read lists like<br/>\nthis, frequent web sites or anything else.  It&#39;s not that hard to imagine<br/>\ngetting a druid in your group that doesn&#39;t know that a mage&#39;s earth pet is<br/>\ngonna screw him up.  You&#39;re there with Chains when that happens.. and a lot<br/>\nof other situations.  Chains is, imo, one of the defining songs of the bard<br/>\nclass and fits in with our crowd control skills.  Don&#39;t forget that Chains<br/>\nhas a whopping 30% mob slowdown to go along with it - that&#39;s like putting a<br/>\nRuned Bolster Belt or Cloak of Flames on each of your meleers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of songs that I essentially never swap out (barring dragons, etc.)<br/>\nat my level is Berserker, Chains, Pixie Strike, Clarity.  At 50 Verses of<br/>\nVictory will swap in for Berserker.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s nice<br/>\n&gt; to have when the real spells fail.  I waited 22 levels for this.  Sigh,<br/>\n&gt; maybe I should just give in and play a necro so I can complain<br/>\n&gt; about how my<br/>\n&gt; 400 pt DoT&#39;s take a whole minute to happen and my 65 point<br/>\n&gt; heal/DD&#39;s aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mana efficient because my pet keeps me from ever taking damage.
