I had the same thing happen to me once - saved my life.  I had just<br/>\nfinished polishing off a harrier in south karana.  I was looting the body,<br/>\nwhen another harrier jumped me.  He got a couple sweet hits on me that drove<br/>\nme below one bubble of health (I was heavily damaged to begin with).  I<br/>\nimmediately tried to Fear + Chain him (this was my first mistake - I should<br/>\nhave just zoned).  Needless to say, it didn&#39;t work to well.  He hit me a<br/>\ncouple more times and I went down cold.  Immediately afterwards, Appalling<br/>\nScreech fired and it &quot;stuck&quot;.  The harrier took off and I slowly regained my<br/>\nfeet.  I quickly busted out my drum and boogied to Lake Rathe while uttering<br/>\na prayer of thanks to Bristlebane.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
