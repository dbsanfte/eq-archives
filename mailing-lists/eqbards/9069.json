The reason bards seem to be <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;a lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>\n&gt;everyone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>\n&gt;songs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>\n&gt;coming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>\n&gt;just saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>\n&gt;shields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;druid)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Desmei Sightblinder<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 30 (still) Bard [Povar]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
