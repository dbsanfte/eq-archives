I always, always tell my guildmembers if they <br/>\naren&#39;t having fun in the guild, they should move on.  If their idea <br/>\nof fun meant being able to do a plane or a dragon, then Legends was <br/>\nnot the guild for them since we could not muster the resources <br/>\nrequired to do such an event.  Yes, this places the guild into a <br/>\nvicious cycle and makes it tough to ever get powerful enough to do <br/>\nthings as a guild, but I have always believed in a guild as a means <br/>\nto an end.  The end being more fun for each individual member.  As <br/>\nlong as the guild provides the fun for a person on an individual <br/>\nbasis, great!  However, if the guild is not satisfying an individual, <br/>\nthen it&#39;s great they can find a way to have fun with someone else.  <br/>\nOne way of looking at it is to not think of it as losing a <br/>\nguildmember, rather think of it as gaining an ambassador within <br/>\nanother guild.  I have found the people who have left Legends on good <br/>\nterms are still Legends at heart and usually continue to benefit <br/>\nLegends in some way at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Cristi, Bard<br/>\nGuild Leader, Legends<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Kenneth E.

When you steal something, it&#39;s not like the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>object being stolen has to make a specific choice and /storeremove <br/>\nitself.  My first guild on Innoruuk (The Talquinn) had this problem <br/>\nfor a few months.  Every other high level who got to 50 left, <br/>\ngenerally because we weren&#39;t big enough to do the dragons/planes <br/>\nstuff.  So we ended up merging with two and a half other guilds <br/>\n(Crimson Sigil, Order of the Black Staff, and about half of Legends - <br/>\nsorry, Rosha).  I&#39;d say that, in our ability to get stuff done, we&#39;re <br/>\nin the top four now.  We asked<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone to remove himself from the guild last night, though, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>because he was clearly courting the #1 guild.  It is kind of annoying <br/>\nto be a training ground for higher level guilds, particularly when <br/>\nthey do not show any courtesy or respect when dealing with you <br/>\nnormally.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 49.45 songs, Innoruuk, Order of the Black <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Staff<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Paul Kline wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Papa,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Agreed.

I was one of the <br/>\norginal members of a guild on Innoruuk called &quot;Higher Arts of Arcane&quot; <br/>\n(sp)   I left that guild in a heart beat when it came time to group <br/>\nand &quot;guild members&quot; come first!  though I played with the party more <br/>\nthan 3 weeks straight and got bumped because of guild rules!  Now, <br/>\ninstead of bitching about the guild rules, I dropped the guild I was <br/>\nin and joined all my friends guild.  Immediately I got things that I <br/>\nhave been struggling to get.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My point. YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PLAYER <br/>\n </span></blockquote>STEALING.  It is a choice.  Yes, My x-guildmaster had a problem. It <br/>\nwas quickly solved after I took anonymous off and he was nearly 20 <br/>\nlvls below me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paul<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Papa Legba<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Ahhh we have gotten to another peev of mine...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Guilds stealing players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   This term makes no sense to me.
