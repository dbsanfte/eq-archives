To enhance tanks in a tank<br/>\nheavy group, to tank for casters (a little is better than none, right?<br/>\nheh), in a caster heavy group, to control mobs, or heal, or fill whichever<br/>\nlittle niche that was empty in any given group.  To be able to run fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, now I&#39;ve learned that if a group is &quot;adequate&quot;, they&#39;ll not want to<br/>\nadd more members (may change, perhaps, now that we know there *is* a<br/>\ngrouping bonus, and that it will be increased in the near future?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always been my biggest peeve.  To walk up to a group that isn&#39;t full,<br/>\nfighting things that are great xp to me, only to be turned away.  I never<br/>\nunderstand that, if an addition of a group member makes the xp slower, then<br/>\nmove on to something a little harder, that will give more xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, then again, I don&#39;t worship the almighty yellow bar, either.  I&#39;m more<br/>\nthan happy to be in a good group, and just see the &quot;got xp&quot; message after<br/>\nevery kill...*sigh*, it is just a game, afterall.  What is enjoyable about<br/>\nplaying &quot;Make the Yellow Bar Bigger!&quot;?  Maybe some people understand.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not spent much time with Atonal lately.  I just don&#39;t have the time to<br/>\ndedicate anymore to 60% group hunting, 20% travel, and a measly 20% doing<br/>\nwhat I want...grouped and fighting.  I&#39;d join my guild mates...if the lowest<br/>\ndidn&#39;t outlevel me by about 15 levels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 26 now, and yeah, I can fear kite, and in another level charm kite, or<br/>\nwhatever you wanna call it...but, where solo&#39;ing with a druid is kinda fun,<br/>\nsolo&#39;ing as a bard is just tedious.  All those group skills, for nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBleh, now I&#39;m rambling, waiting for lunch time to arrive...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Khelan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khelan@...\">khelan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 9:05 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When<br/>\nI first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>\ntheir corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>\nrun faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>\nonce you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, crying over his loss of speed<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
