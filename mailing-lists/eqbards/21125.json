It will proc a LOT more there (esp if you have high dex).<br/>\nYour dex bonus isn&#39;t applied to your off-hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since the Yak is slightly faster (hardly at all tho) you&#39;ll balance<br/>\nout the (very slight) damage difference by getting to apply your strength<br/>\nbonus more often. And since the yak will proc far more often (if you have<br/>\ndex over 100) in your primary hand you&#39;ll more than make up for the<br/>\ndifference in dmg with the additional procs you&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!  I would also recommend a Sionache&#39;s partisan instead of the Yak<br/>\n;)  It&#39;s 9/19 and some pretty impressive stat bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m actually using melee I use a Sionache&#39;s partisan and a Saeiny&#39;s<br/>\nClaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n(yeah, I&#39;d like to upgrade the Claw, just haven&#39;t had the time)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 28, 2000 4:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Weapon selections..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; Well its time for me to call upon the experinced souls here to get some<br/>\nadvice<br/>\n&gt; regarding weapons. I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>\n&gt; - Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic<br/>\nprot.  Wt.<br/>\n&gt; 3.5.<br/>\n&gt; - Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of<br/>\nYkesha<br/>\n&gt; (75 point direct damage spell)<br/>\n&gt; - Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>\n&gt; - Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>\n&gt; - Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>\n&gt; Currently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is<br/>\nbetter<br/>\n&gt; than with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my<br/>\ndoubts. Im<br/>\n&gt; not satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>\n&gt; suggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>\n&gt; I have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is<br/>\nresisted<br/>\n&gt; quite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Musiker(x) Silverdrum, bard of the 38th song, bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
