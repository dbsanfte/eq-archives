We&#39;re<br/>\nnow proud to announce the launch of Yahoo! Groups, a new service from Yahoo!<br/>\nusing eGroups technology.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Happened to eGroups?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the features you know and love about eGroups have carried over and we&#39;ve<br/>\nadded some new functionality that we hope you&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry, all eGroups email and web addresses will continue to work, and<br/>\nall of your group information and membership has been maintained.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll soon begin to internationalize Yahoo! Groups. In the interim, you can<br/>\ncontinue to use the international versions of eGroups.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s new on Yahoo! Groups?<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups has lots of new features and even better customization. You<br/>\ncan:<br/>\nChat with other group members using our improved Yahoo! Chat<br/>\nAdd a splash of color to your group, or a main page photo, all without<br/>\nknowing HTML<br/>\nSee when group members are online and communicate with them in real time<br/>\nusing Yahoo! Messenger<br/>\nReach a larger audience - you will have the entire Yahoo! Network at your<br/>\ndoorstep<br/>\nAnd much, much more to come!<br/>\nThe best part -- you don&#39;t have to do anything to convert your group. This<br/>\nhas all happened automatically. All you have to do to access the wide array<br/>\nof web functionality is link your current eGroups account with a Yahoo! ID<br/>\nby clicking on the &quot;Convert my eGroups account&quot; link below.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, if you would like to continue using only the email<br/>\ncapabilities of the service, you won&#39;t need a Yahoo ID. You will continue to<br/>\nreceive and post mail, just like you always have in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a detailed FAQ on merger topics, please go here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn behalf of everyone here at Yahoo! Groups, thanks for being a member of<br/>\nour service.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Yahoo! Groups team<br/>\n==============<br/>\n<br/>\nConvert to Egroups account to Yahoo Groups account:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/convwiz\">http://groups.yahoo.com/convwiz</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
