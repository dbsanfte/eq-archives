Like I said, in a typical night of hunting giants,<br/>\neveryone in my group will get a stone (we did this twice).<br/>\nGiven the rate they drop, I&#39;d value them at around 10-15pp.  <br/>\nYou&#39;d have to be nuts to expect 150pp one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther classes can use the stones.  There is a quest for some<br/>\nsort of staff that uses the stones, and the bard armor is not<br/>\nno-drop so could be traded/twinked.  Dunno if other classes<br/>\ncan do the quests.  Still, I&#39;d expect it to soon become like<br/>\ncrafted armor, where the resulting armor sells for a little<br/>\nabove or even below the cost of the gems to complete the<br/>\nquest.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
