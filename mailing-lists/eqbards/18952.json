Stratics has a couple of problems IMHO.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1.  their site is a pain in the rear to navigate.  Everything is hidden under<br/>\nambiguous headings.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  most of their information is pretty accurate and detailed--if this was<br/>\nstill eq beta 4.  I would even go so far as the first couple of months of<br/>\nrelease.  they do *not* consistently keep any of their EQ content updated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, it would be unfair to bury your site in that mire...it is too valueable<br/>\nto be filed away 15 links down on a disorganized website.<br/>\n<br/>\nWasn&#39;t trying to sound real harsh...but i guess it came across that way :( <br/>\nsorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKaleid 23rd lvl half elf bard, prexus(retired)<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss 30th lvl dark elf magician, prexus(retired)<br/>\n--<br/>\nHiro Protagonist<br/>\n30th lvl wood elf druid<br/>\nSecretary of Transportation<br/>\n*Tears of Prexus*<br/>\nMorrell-Thule<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The only problem I have with it is that Stratics hasn&#39;t kept up at all<br/>\n&gt;on EQ, with a lot of their content and reference pages still unchanged<br/>\n&gt;since beta. As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt;no downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>\n&gt;away on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>\n&gt;info.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Check their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>\n&gt;statistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list. They have 20 songs.<br/>\n&gt;I guess it&#39;s nice that they are looking for a better list now but my<br/>\n&gt;question would be; why, after over a year of total neglect, are they<br/>\n&gt;bothering?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;On Tue, May 23/00, &quot;Reeves, Patrick W&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I received an email last night from Manga of the EverQuest Stratics site.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; They are interested in hosting the Song Analysis on their network.
