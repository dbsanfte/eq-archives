Also over the weekend I re-discovered the joys <br/>\nof an old song, Lugborious Lament :)  It started in Sol B when I was the <br/>\nonly tank in a group at the Sol A bug line.  I deciced to give Lament a try <br/>\nand it worked better then I remember. Was lulling bats, beetles, LDCs, Nox, <br/>\nanything that got in my way :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen last night after Vox (which was John&#39;s (tm) first dragon run btw) I <br/>\ndrummed down to lower guk to help a guildmate get a Ykesha.  As we are <br/>\nforming up in the Magi room the Magi makes an appearence and is quickly <br/>\ndispatched droping a fine new robe for our wizard.  the hall between the <br/>\nMagi and the Lord was fully spawned and the nearest party that was pulling <br/>\nfrom the area was in Frenzied. So we has to break the hall and the room.  We <br/>\nrecon and see the Lord is up with a guk wizard, a bok and a Ykesha, but our <br/>\ncleric loses invis and a wondering frog agros and we have to evac.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we get back to the Magi and I pull out lute and start pulling the hall <br/>\nfrogs.  We quickly clear the hall and head to the room.  Now the Bok is <br/>\nyellow and the guk wiz is red.  So we med up,  I lull the Bok then the guk. <br/>\nOur cleric pulls the lord and eats the HT with an invulnerbility  The Guk <br/>\nstays put but the Bok comes.  After a long, long battle we take out the lord <br/>\nand the bok only losing one of our 2 clerics. It was great if only lower guk <br/>\ncould be like that every night :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
