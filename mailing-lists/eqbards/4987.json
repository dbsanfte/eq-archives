This great weapon can be found in Upper Guk on a mob<br/>\nthat was green to me at level 25 when I got mine (Hint: Its the same frog<br/>\nthat carries the necklace of undead protection).  The fork is a rare drop,<br/>\ntook a week for me and the other member of my regular party to each get one.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
