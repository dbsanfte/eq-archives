Myself and a Wizard ran around<br/>\ngetting all those pieces, unfortunatly now I need a group for the rest, and<br/>\nas I&#39;m sure you know, no one is horribly excited about doing SolA.  I&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably try for the boots and vambraces next.  Lambent stones continue to<br/>\nbe the thorn in my side.  I just did the helm quest the other night and<br/>\nGenni worked fine, might only be a server specific problem.  Genni is<br/>\nlocated (from the main bard quest NPC&#39;s), up the ramp in the center, through<br/>\nthe door, take a right and go through I think 3 doors or so, she is there<br/>\nwith one other NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Arithon, Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
