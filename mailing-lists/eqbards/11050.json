Verant, in their infinite wisdom, fixed<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;this problem by making it impossible to refresh any levitate effect.  Had <br/>\n&gt;any bard-players been on the develpoment team you would think (I certainly <br/>\n&gt;would, in any case) that the obvious effect on bards would be, well, <br/>\n&gt;obvious.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually being an active member of an application development team in real<br/>\nlife, I would have though even the non-bard players among the team would<br/>\nhave had as their very first question, &quot;Ok good solution, what other<br/>\npotential problems could this cause?&quot;  Obviously no one at Verant even<br/>\nbothers to ask.  That should be every developers first question after<br/>\ndeciding to modify some code in an integrated system.  I can think of no one<br/>\nstill employed at any company I have worked for from any development team<br/>\nwho would modify a function that is called without first considering the<br/>\nramifications those modifications might have on other function calls.<br/>\nHowever, I have never worked for Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt;frustrated red-headed stepchild<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey!
