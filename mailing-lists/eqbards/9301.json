A sucessfull lament will _NOT_ <br/>\nadd you to a mob&#39;s hate list, thus they will still be standing there<br/>\nwaiting for you to pull it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullabye (Song 15) is used to &#39;sleep&#39; mobs once they have already <br/>\nattacked. Typically, as long as no one hits htem, and they are <br/>\n&#39;nodding&#39;, they are just standing there. Good crowd control. It is <br/>\nan AE (Area of effect) song.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodic Binding (song 20) is an AE song that slows the mobs down (ie<br/>\nattacks) and lowers their AC slightly. Takes the sting out of hard <br/>\nhitters.<br/>\n<br/>\nChain (Song 23 i think) is essentially the same as ensnare (druid) <br/>\nIt &#39;slows&#39; the mob down when it trys to run. (Similar to root, but <br/>\nthe wonderful thing about snare is that a snared running monster <br/>\ndoesnt fight back, but a &#39;rooted&#39; monster DOES fight back. Same for<br/>\ncasters.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Works wonderfully with &#39;Fear&#39; (song 26))  (snare the monster, then<br/>\nfear them, and the mob sits there and trys to run away while you beat <br/>\nit in the back =)) (repeat as the monster comes unfear&#39;d)<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm is where you take control of a mob and force it to attack another<br/>\nmob. (or sit down or whatever else pets do =)) (10 sec duration)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrashii, 26th Chant Bard<br/>\nSeeker of Lore Officer, Tarew Marr  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Frashii wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. &#39;Lament&#39; (Make em sad) the ones you DON&#39;T want to fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3.
