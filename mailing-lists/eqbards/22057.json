Could it be we might have someone represent us that has <br/>\n&gt; a clue now?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Many of my people brag that they have been granted the best <br/>\n&gt; traits of their<br/>\n&gt; parents. Perhaps. But we also bear the burden of that <br/>\n&gt; heritage. Neither<br/>\n&gt; Humans nor Elves love us, yet we must find our way in their <br/>\n&gt; society. Often<br/>\n&gt; enough this isolation breaks our spirit. We have never found our own<br/>\n&gt; society, and therefore can find no place to call home. But <br/>\n&gt; for some, myself<br/>\n&gt; included, this has been a blessing. We are not restricted by racial<br/>\n&gt; boundaries, and have the pleasure to claim all of Norrath as home.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   -  Absor, Half-Elven Bard <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forgive my happiness, i know bards aren&#39;t suppose to be all cheery and<br/>\n&gt; affect their entourage in a positive way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get FREE long-distance phone calls on Tellme!<br/>\n&gt; Dial 1-800-555-TELL, say &quot;Phone Booth&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/9816/13/_/451022/_/971819023/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/9816/13/_/451022/_/971819023/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -------_-&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
