I wish they&#39;d raise<br/>\nour H2H cap as well.  I&#39;d much rather have a 200 skill in H2H than in say...<br/>\n1hb with as often as I use all instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night my group was camping the frenzy so some of our warriors could get<br/>\na sash (I&#39;ve had mine since 37th) and all we had for healing was a druid.  I<br/>\nwent all-instrument (HoR, Celerity, Largos, CoD) Lute only (didn&#39;t feel like<br/>\nbouncing instruments around and we had 4 melee&#39;ers so celerity was better<br/>\nthan another DOT)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that combination our druid had to heal 1 maybe 2 times during any given<br/>\nfight even the BT&#39;s weren&#39;t bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards use H2H second only to Monks.  I really wish Verant would raise our<br/>\nskill cap in it.  I capped H2H LONG before I capped 1hs/pierce/1hb in any<br/>\ngiven level after 18th.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 17, 2000 12:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] ...but it&#39;s still easier than playing a rogue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Wisps are magic only to hit, but in a an all song<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attack, that&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a problem.
