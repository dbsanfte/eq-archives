I had never had the chance to test this until I was helping a<br/>\ndruid friend get their body from LavaStorm.  I asked if they wanted to group<br/>\nand use my song or if they just wanted to use SoW as we ran through the<br/>\nforest.  Well she tried to keep up with me using SoW and couldn&#39;t so I<br/>\ngrouped her and used Selo.  I am only 14th Level with a standard drum.  Just<br/>\nthought I would share :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jontom 14th Bard - Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
