Cazic is the least appealing dungeon in the<br/>\ngame (visually, and list camping wise), and it was way worse back in the<br/>\nRuby newbie days (when you were there).;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Martyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nat the risk of Kit becoming nauseous, i spent 19 to 38 all in cazic =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbut i was rushing.  with my new character i like to go places i haven&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\nbefore.  where i am now is Paw.  the most i have ever seen is 24 ppl, and<br/>\n<br/>\nthe average is 2 groups max.  its great exp for 32 to 35 in the front rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nand its new to me, i never fought there before the change or in beta.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L35 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Heh heh, Brave Heart Madagan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m 28 days old and only 21st level.  The problem is, <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; leveling generally is<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; boring.  I get bored trying to stay in one place for long, <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; much less at one<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; camp.  Whenever I see that someone stayed in the Highkeep <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; basement for 3<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; levels or is Cazic for 5 levels, I get that sick feeling in <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the pit of my<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; stomach.  If that&#39;s what it takes to level beyond 25 I never <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; will.  Doing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; those things is not fun for me in the least, and if the game <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t fun I<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t play, pure and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
