Upgrade to charm.  Doesn&#39;t require a flute.  Uses<br/>\nmana, but during a 5 minute session charming seafuries, I only<br/>\nhad a sliver of white show up.  I suspect what&#39;s going on is<br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t want us running around in circles for 15+<br/>\nminutes trying over and over to charm mobs that were red to<br/>\nus, relying on the occasional success to help us kill 2 red<br/>\nmobs.  When I tried the song on myself (with 61 MR I resist<br/>\nabout half the time), I did notice an appreciable amount of<br/>\nmana loss - maybe a quarter bubble - in about 1 minute.  <br/>\n(Btw, seafuries make terrible charming targets - they do<br/>\nrelatively little damage compared to their hp, and take a<br/>\nreally long time to kill each other.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t test for level limit.  If we can charm level 50<br/>\nstuff, then I need to go try charming Brother Zephyl - he can<br/>\nkill a hill giant in 11 seconds.  :)  Course he resisted all<br/>\nmy Chains previously so who knows...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very welcome and long overdue upgrade.  I will not<br/>\nbe avoiding the dead side of LGuk and the bug/bats in Sol B<br/>\nanymore.  And I guess I&#39;ll have to stop passing on all the<br/>\nOrbs of Tishan that drop off Nagafen.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nL45 - str/atk buff, attack speedup, and magical skin (a la<br/>\nRune).  It&#39;s targeted, but seems to work on both party members<br/>\nand non-party members.  It does seem to be a &quot;twinking&quot; song,<br/>\nbut OTOH I can see it being useful in emergencies when your<br/>\nhealer is OOM and someone is about to die.  Previously, all we<br/>\ncould do was charm the mob, which only pauses things.  Now we<br/>\ncan put a small Rune on someone.  I haven&#39;t tested how many hp<br/>\nthe rune is yet.  It does *not* work on charmed pets - you get<br/>\na &quot;you cannot cast this spell on this NPC&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big problem with this song is that it seems they forgot<br/>\nour brass skill caps at 200.  You get a ton of missed notes<br/>\nwith it even at max skill.  Whatever they did to fix the<br/>\nmissed notes with L41+ songs, they forgot to do with this<br/>\nsong.  /bug it and hope they fix it (servers went down this<br/>\nmorning for a patch so maybe they&#39;ve already fixed it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem with it (if you use it for twinking) is that<br/>\nlow level mobs tend to run at half hp if you use this on<br/>\nsomeone.  They interpret this buff as you aggroing on them,<br/>\nand since you&#39;re so high level, they run at half.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, very welcome additions.  I&#39;m on the verge of<br/>\nthinking the bard is overpowered again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
