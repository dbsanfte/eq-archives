I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t believe it until my group added a 6th person, and our xp rate<br/>\nincreased dramatically. The 6th person we added was AFK and just sat on a<br/>\nrock the whole time. We were doing crocs and caimans in Oasis so the type of<br/>\ncreature didn&#39;t change. My buddy (also in the groupt) Petitioned a GM to get<br/>\nthe skinny on this. The GM wouldn&#39;t give out a figure, but did acknowledge<br/>\nthere is a bonus for total XP distributed in a party of 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives high level people incentive to get a group of 5 lower ranked<br/>\nparty members. That person will rake in the XP so long as they&#39;re killing<br/>\nthings that aren&#39;t too low for his/her level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jay schultze [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Please give me a reason to play<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jay schultze&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nThis is from my viewpoint - a former beta-tester who hasn&#39;t jumped into <br/>\ncommercial yet, so correct any misinformation and I thank you in advance  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are 33 and people 3-5 levels above you won&#39;t group with you?!<br/>\nWTF? They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you <br/>\naround. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for similar<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below <br/>\nlimit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group <br/>\nwith a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th <br/>\nlevel ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put <br/>\nany significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either <br/>\nignorant, or greedy. My 32nd lvl friend used to party with 40th lvl ppl all <br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
