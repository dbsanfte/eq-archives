One of the reasons I test this<br/>\non low greens is because mobs closer to your level have a<br/>\ngreater chance of breaking out of the effect (you will become<br/>\nintimately familiar with this when they break out of Chain at<br/>\nthe worst possible time).  So it&#39;s possible (likely even<br/>\ndepending on /con) that when you switched to Chain, the one<br/>\nyou weren&#39;t Chaining broke out of Binding and was attacking at<br/>\nnormal speed, while the one you were Chaining was still slowed<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
