Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>\nquest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>\ntimes, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need strings?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>\nto locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrin<br/>\n(Tunare)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
