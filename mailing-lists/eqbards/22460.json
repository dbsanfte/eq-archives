Unpack, Paint, and Hang Curtains!  I&#39;ve played that!  Here was my<br/>\n&gt; strategy:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attack the paint first.  Twist Largo&#39;s Consonant Chain to ensure no drip<br/>\n&gt; marks spawn.  Do NOT use Binding.  You do not want to reduce the AC of<br/>\n&gt; paint, trust me.  Also twist Vilia&#39;s Chorus of Celerity and Jig O&#39; Vigor<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; ensure all the paint is dealt with before boxes or curtains start to<br/>\nspawn.<br/>\n&gt; I did this wielding a brush in my primary and can in my off-hand.  This<br/>\n&gt; meant occasionally twisting Aria of Eagles in order to secure the zone.<br/>\n&gt; But if you can afford it, go to Greater Fay and buy a two-handed,<br/>\n&gt; rechargeable, extended handle paint applicator.  It&#39;s more reliable than<br/>\n&gt; the Aria and will allow you to twist Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision as<br/>\nneeded<br/>\n&gt; if any of your group members go out looking for boxes too soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next attack the curtains.  Some would argue boxes should be dealt with<br/>\n&gt; next, but I&#39;ve found that by the time you&#39;ve attacked all the curtains in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; particular zone you invariably find more paint spawn points that you<br/>\nmissed<br/>\n&gt; the first time.  And you want all the paint out of the way before you<br/>\n&gt; tackle the boxes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For curtains, use Aria of Eagles, Psalm of Cooling (Curtains have pets<br/>\n&gt; called Drafts which are very low-level but can make attacking the curtains<br/>\n&gt; an aggravating experience), and Celerity.   It is rumored that the level<br/>\n49<br/>\n&gt; song was to be Fufil&#39;s Curtaining Chant, but that Verant didn&#39;t feel bards<br/>\n&gt; should be allowed to corner the market on Interior Decorating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, attack the boxes.  Break the spawns carefully.  An uncontrolled<br/>\n&gt; train of boxes is a very, very scary thing.  And they have a remarkable<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; of blocking the exits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If all goes well with the boxes, you should be able to control the zone<br/>\n&gt; using Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, and<br/>\nVerses<br/>\n&gt; of Celerity.  (Due to the need to frequently jump or climb over boxes, the<br/>\n&gt; agility buff of VoC makes it a better choice than the pure haste effect of<br/>\n&gt; CoC)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the boxes begin spawning uncontrollably, immediately stop your haste<br/>\n&gt; song.  Twist instead Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric, Cataloging Libretto, and<br/>\n&gt; Solidarity of Vision.  (It is believed Lyssa did most of her composing<br/>\n&gt; while attacking boxes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When all the boxes are dealt with, sing Cantana of Replenishment.  Your<br/>\n&gt; party will appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Safe travels,<br/>\n&gt; Evulia, Jester of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
