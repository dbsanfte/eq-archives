I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to<br/>\n&gt;because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question are mostly<br/>\n&gt;blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found this spot<br/>\n&gt;when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms,<br/>\n&gt;RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them and get on<br/>\n&gt;to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the<br/>\n&gt;dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me<br/>\n&gt;&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a<br/>\n&gt;computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t*<br/>\n&gt;exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that I--or anyone<br/>\n&gt;else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is using your <br/>\n&gt;head<br/>\n&gt;to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a bunch of wacko<br/>\n&gt;powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word<br/>\n&gt;&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.  Play how they<br/>\n&gt;want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and epitomy of<br/>\n&gt;powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only problem <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;have ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple people mind <br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt;own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you see <br/>\n&gt;someone<br/>\n&gt;playing the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cooter<br/>\n&gt;21st no matter how I got here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like roleplaying and such, but i&#39;m not hardcore about it on EQ. I will do <br/>\nit with ppl outside my group but normally within.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as exploiting - during beta i did this once in Blackburrow. I would <br/>\ntrain some gnolls to the bottom of the snake room and they would get stuck, <br/>\nand I would Chords them to death. I did this for about 15 minutes until a <br/>\nguide showed up and told me i could be banned for doing that and to <br/>\nimmediately stop. I vowed never to do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after that I had seen world messages announing the banning of <br/>\nplayers for various reasons, among those being exploiting bugs. During <br/>\ncommercial release, I believe you have the possibility of being suspended <br/>\nfor exploiting, not banned. I&#39;d rather not be banned or suspended. Also - <br/>\nnot really a bug exploit, but I also think kiting is a cheesy, cheap-ass, <br/>\nwuss way to solo for kills (not to mention boring as hell). I look down on <br/>\npeople I see exploiting bugs for kills - not because of honor, but in hopes <br/>\nof seeing them get suspended (which is deserved), or at least given a <br/>\nwarning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBugs are not there to exploit. Bugs don&#39;t exist for ppl to exploit (unless <br/>\nthe designers ask them to be for testing reasons). They are there to be <br/>\nfixed by the coders and they come and go. Exploits are the reason I left <br/>\nbattlenet at the end of my Diablo days, got sick and tired of UO after only <br/>\n3 months, and left many an old teamfortress server due to having a million <br/>\nduped sentry turrets all over the place. They just aren&#39;t any fun for me. I <br/>\nget no satisfaction out of killing stuck mobs. Sure it&#39;s nice to see that <br/>\nyellow xp message scroll by, but it&#39;s not much fun to me getting it when it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t earned.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf exploiting bugs to kill mobs all day is fun to you, keep doing it. Just <br/>\nbecause GM&#39;s don&#39;t show up on your /who all GM list, doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>\naren&#39;t there, looking over your shoulder. I personally will send a petition <br/>\nin if I see someone doing it. You deserve to be suspended - period.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave &quot;fun&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 30th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
