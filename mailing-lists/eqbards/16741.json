We already have one song that burns our entire mana bar.  I really don&#39;t want to see _any_ of our songs using mana.  We are already horribly restricted in that we can only keep 2, 3 or (for those with powerhouse systems) 4 songs running at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t propose mana costs in our songs unless you also propose that our meditate cap be removed and our immunity to clarity effects be removed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I play a bard because I don&#39;t have/need to meditate.  I _loathe_ sitting on my can waiting for mana.  I stopped playing casters completely because of it and once my ranger hit 34th I got so sick of it I started another bard on Rallos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
