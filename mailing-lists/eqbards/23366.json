The active lineup of my guild near my level is<br/>\nCurrently Four Druids, Two Paladins, A Ranger and myself.  Most of them just<br/>\ngot to the 49-50 Range (and Hit 51 pretty fast 49 and 50 are pretty easy to<br/>\nlevel through) and want to group together.  Many of them didn&#39;t even spend<br/>\ntime in Karnor until recently and are looking to me (52) and the 53 Druid<br/>\n(Guild leader) to take them to places like Sebelis and Chardok.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo my concern - can a group of typically Three Druids, 2 Paladins (or<br/>\nPaladin/Ranger) and a Bard survive in places like<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFor practice - to be honest - I&#39;m more concerned about the rest of the<br/>\ngroup than myself...  I&#39;ve done crowd control very successfully in Karnor<br/>\nand even Chardok zone (albeit with different groups often containing a<br/>\nShaman) and relying on Charm...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn the positive - I&#39;m very close to 53 (slightly more than 3 blue bubs) so<br/>\nI&#39;ve excited by my upcoming improved abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.
