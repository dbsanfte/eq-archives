I have read previously on this list<br/>\n&gt;that our song does stack with an Enchanter&#39;s Clarity spell.  Does anyone<br/>\n&gt;have hard number with what percentage increase there is?  Is it in fact<br/>\n&gt;Enchanter Clarity + Bard Clarity?  The one thing that I&#39;ve been told that I<br/>\n&gt;had no previous knowledge of is that Bard Clarity stacks with Bard Clarity.<br/>\n&gt;Is this so?  If so, is it Bard Clarity + Bard Clarity, or a lesser<br/>\n&gt;percentage of increase.  What about three or more bards in a group, etc.?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt;EverQuest - Pretend it&#39;s a game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
