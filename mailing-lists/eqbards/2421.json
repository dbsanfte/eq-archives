OK, John, I feel exactly the same way as you about knowing my way around, but the turn on autorun and go get something to eat can be dangerous =)  I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1633416317\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;I&#39;ll say the same thing I told a guildmate who is mapping<br/>\n&gt;the zones.  Maps are nice, but nothing beats just plain<br/>\n&gt;knowing the terrain and topology.  You could drop me anywhere<br/>\n&gt;in Butcherblock, North Ro, Oasis, the Commonlands, or Misty<br/>\n&gt;Thicket and I would just *know* where I am, no need for a map.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m almost to that point with Greater Faydark, Steamfont,<br/>\n&gt;South Ro, the Karanas, and Kithicor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most everyone I meet is impressed when I tell them which trees<br/>\n&gt;or landmarks to use to set up a running vector directly from<br/>\n&gt;one place to another (just hit autorun and go get something to<br/>\n&gt;eat).  You don&#39;t learn this type of stuff from /loc or maps.<br/>\n&gt;You learn it by playing the game.  So while /loc does diminish<br/>\n&gt;the roleplaying nature of the game, it is by no means the<br/>\n&gt;ultimate in terms of in-game navigation.  I&#39;ll note that in<br/>\n&gt;the real world, the places where GPS is most useful are out at<br/>\n&gt;sea and in the air, where landmarks are not readily available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.

I set myself to autorun in N Karana max speed <br/>\nfrom E Karana zone to W Karana zone, and went to get a drink. Luckily i got <br/>\nback JUST in time to save my ass as a passing Hill Giant decided to bash me, <br/>\nSTUN me, and interupt my song. He had me down to about 25% health by the <br/>\ntime i got away from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing i HATE is getting bashed by a green aggro mob while passing it <br/>\n(usually some type of undead) for 1 measly point of damage and it either <br/>\ninterrupts my song, stuns me causing me to stop, or both. &quot;Hear we go <br/>\nagain..&quot; I mutter as I have to switch to weapons to dispatch the critter. I <br/>\nwould just run and let them go, but I have a policy of killing any green mob <br/>\nthat dares aggro me while i&#39;m minding my own business, muahaha =) How DARE <br/>\nthey!<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 28th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
