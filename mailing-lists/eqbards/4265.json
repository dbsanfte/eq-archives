What started out as a great resource<br/>\nfor bards has finally degenerated into flames and topics far removed<br/>\nfrom bards, and even from EQ.  There are a LOT of dead horses being beat<br/>\naround here.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I recieve the digest form of this list.  Out of 25 messages in the<br/>\nmost recent digest, only 6 of them were specifically bard related.  6.<br/>\nThat is all.  I am trying to remember the last thread that vaguely<br/>\ninterested me and frankly I cannot.  Most posts are either about<br/>\ntwinking, acronyms, or posts complaining about the threads, while at the<br/>\nsame time quoting about 100+ lines of text.  Hardly what I would deem<br/>\nworth my time to scroll through.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I will be unsubscribing from this list soon if this keeps up.<br/>\nPlease remember the rules of etiquette on this mailing list.  Here are a<br/>\nfew:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  No messages that say &quot;Me too&quot; and then quote several pages of<br/>\nearlier posts.  Please either keep this to yourself or e-mail the author<br/>\ndirectly, as this is not the place for such.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Any threads that are not related to EQ, and bards specifically.  I<br/>\ncould care less about lottery winners&#39; lifestyles, opinions on twinking,<br/>\nor witty and pointless explanations of what RTS means.  There are forums<br/>\nfor this sort of thing, try eq.stratics.com or www.eqvault.com.  Stick<br/>\nto bard stuff here please.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  EXCESSIVE quoting of other messages.  Please snip if you feel you<br/>\nhave to quote.  And for those who recieve each e-mail from the list,<br/>\nplease change the subject if the subject has changed, like so:<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: How Jackpot Winners Live, was Re: Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Personal discussions and flames should be via e-mail if at all.  If<br/>\nI wanted petty squabbling I would go back to reading newsgroups.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Now, please, people, we have a good resource here and I suggest that<br/>\nwe use it.  No one person can know all there is to know in the game, and<br/>\nso this list was created.  Let&#39;s get back to bards here.<br/>\n<br/>\n    New thread topic, just so this post has worth.  Definitely bard<br/>\nrelated, as it deals with equipment that all bards will eventually need.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Recently, the spawn on rubicite armor has been messed up.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t drop any more, apparently.  In Cazic-Thule, where ruby normally<br/>\ndrops, at a peak time, there were only 6 people.  This got me to<br/>\nthinking.  After some thought I have come to a conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nRubicite armor is too good to be in EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Let me back this up.  8 out of the 14 classes can wear ruby.  That<br/>\nis more than half.  Of these 8, 3 of those classes (rogue, ranger,<br/>\nshaman) CANNOT wear regular plate, and so it is obviously HIGHLY<br/>\ndesirable for them.  However, ruby is also BETTER than the Steel Plate<br/>\nthat can be bought by the other 5 classes, so they want it too.  In<br/>\naddition, Steel Plate is so expensive that many players will just camp<br/>\nfor ruby instead of buying steel..<br/>\n<br/>\n    So, we have an armor that is arguably the best magical armor that<br/>\ncan be had, for more than half of the players in EQ.  (Yes, Mithril and<br/>\na few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>\nexample we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>\nplace.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>\nNEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This throws everything out of whack.  Camping is SUCH an issue with<br/>\nruby that apparently Verant decided to take it out of the game, at least<br/>\nfor a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    SO what can be done to solve this problem?  Here are a few<br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Make Steel Plate cheaper.  If a 40th level bard can go and spend a<br/>\nreasonable amount of plat on Steel from an NPC, why camp for ruby?  A<br/>\nfull set of Steel Plate, just the visible pieces, mind you, costs over<br/>\n3000 plat.  A good hunk of change, even at those levels.  Probably<br/>\neasier to just get in a group camping ruby and just wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Make ruby the same AC as Steel.  That way, classes who can normally<br/>\nwear plate will have no real reason to camp for it.  It would be easier<br/>\nand less boring to just save up and buy Steel.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Make other, better magical armors for the plate wearing classes.  If<br/>\nthere was Sapphirite Armor, 1 AC better than Rubicite, usable only by<br/>\nclasses who can wear plate, that dropped off of say unique minotaurs in<br/>\nBeholder, then that would cut down on the demand for ruby and thus the<br/>\ncamping for it. [ Note: if Green Splinted Platemail (like Aradune wears)<br/>\nmakes it into the game, and is wearable by those who can wear ruby and<br/>\nby monks also (like it is rumored to), then green will replace ruby as<br/>\nthe best armor in the game, and will be camped like hell, not solving<br/>\nthe problem at all.]<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Make ruby only usable by Shamans, Rogues, and Rangers.  This, again,<br/>\nwould cut down on demand and thus on the camping as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Basically, these ideas popped into my head when I was in Solusek B,<br/>\nhunting fire giants in a big guild meeting.  About 20 people above 40th<br/>\nwere there, and ALL of them that could wear it had some rubicite on.<br/>\nAll.  I think this is a bad thing, that there should be more variety of<br/>\nequipment among players who can roam Norrath without fear (much).<br/>\nHopefully, Verant has seen this problem and is taking steps to correct<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So what do you all think?  When you get to that level, will you<br/>\nsettle for steel?  Or will you join the droves that want rubicite<br/>\ninstead?  Can we think of other ways to solve the problem?  IS this a<br/>\nproblem?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn topic discussion is appreciated.  And please, keep it about bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov Shostakovich<br/>\nBard of the 25th Song<br/>\nThe Erudin Arcanium<br/>\nCazic - Thule<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marcallie@...\">marcallie@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
