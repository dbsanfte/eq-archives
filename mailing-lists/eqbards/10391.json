Neither<br/>\n&quot;twisted&quot; at all - they just each kept one song going the whole time. One<br/>\ndoing Hymn the other doing Jig.  I don&#39;t think they even bellowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got into a major argument with one of the bards about the Jig thing.  It<br/>\nwas funny that laughed off &quot;the old rumor that Jig DOESN&#39;T increase mana<br/>\nrecovery&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing about it - one of my best bud&#39;s and guildmates - a<br/>\ncleric - felt that it WAS helping him.  This is a VERY knowledgeable player.<br/>\nI explained to him the &quot;apparent speed&quot; issue - and he still felt it<br/>\nincreased mana recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to keep in mind about my bud - he lives in a remote part of<br/>\nWisconsin - has TERRIBLE connectivity - goes linkdead constantly.  He ALWAYS<br/>\nhas bad PL/ping.  So I suspect that in the case of these people bad<br/>\nconnectivity - the jig song actually may help.   Jig may essentially force<br/>\nmore frequent server updates.  For those of us lucky enough to have<br/>\nbroadband access - or clean dialups - more frequent server updates makes no<br/>\ndifference - so we KNOW jig doesn&#39;t help.  But perhaps for the others -<br/>\nperhaps it negates the lag caused by the bad connectivity?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust one bard&#39;s theory here..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brett@...\">Brett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 20, 1999 9:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: songs question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was already a<br/>\n&gt; bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she was<br/>\n&gt; singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>\n&gt; finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then after<br/>\n&gt; each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster to<br/>\n&gt; heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>\n&gt; recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level 32<br/>\n&gt; wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she said<br/>\n&gt; the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>\n&gt; play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I ran a<br/>\n&gt; test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>\n&gt; confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot; (I<br/>\n&gt; should make a hotkey for that :). Can&#39;t Verant just put a note in the<br/>\n&gt; news confirming and denying some basic rumors like this and the 6 person<br/>\n&gt; XP bonus? Would make our lives easier :)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
