Please remember this is my first<br/>\nmail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so many of<br/>\nthese comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I<br/>\nhave read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high level<br/>\nplayer, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me to keep<br/>\nsinging my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him for<br/>\nseveral hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he<br/>\nsaid he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I needed<br/>\nexp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me and<br/>\ninitiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he said<br/>\nyes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair<br/>\nof Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could see via<br/>\nAC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good for my<br/>\nlevel. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear<br/>\nthem/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with twinking but dont<br/>\nwant to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an opinion on what I<br/>\nshould!<br/>\n&gt;  do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Nina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get your free email from AltaVista at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
