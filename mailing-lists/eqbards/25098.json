Many, many conch shell horns and immaculent conch shells dropped...and a walrus skin drum.<br/>\nlots of other stuff dropped too, including gems and a Wavecrasher (I lost the lotto for it but at least I got the drum).<br/>\nSome advice for bards headed that way -- <br/>\nPsalm of warmth, pixie strike against watery/icey servants who cast drake-type AOE attacks<br/>\nEnticing sirens swarm bards who use charm (but it also may be because I was the lowest in my group) <br/>\nOur master looter was dropping runed shell necklaces on the ground along with non-quest gems.  Runed shell necklaces have five charges of enduring breath on them and sell to vendors for 11pp and change.  I picked up a fair amount of trash that day and sang all the way to the bank ;-)<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
