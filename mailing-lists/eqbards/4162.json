Should they just delete that character and lose the<br/>\nrubicite?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How are they depriving anyone else?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s quite clear that simply twinking a character and CAMPING<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; items to twink another char are quite different.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But these are indistinguishable.  Given a symptom that has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; neutral cause and a negative cause, you are going to share in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the misery handed out by those bitter about the negative<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cause.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re indistinguishable to you. What business is it of yours? None.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If there&#39;s a symptom of something that has a GOOD cause (prevents me from<br/>\n&gt; going and camping with my new character all over again) and a negative<br/>\n&gt; cause, YOU may share in the misery, but I won&#39;t. Not once have I felt any<br/>\n&gt; pain due to a twinked person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had friends do the same thing as you.  But I daresay,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most twinked characters are secondary (or third, or fourth,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc) characters made by players who want to build up a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh yes, look at all those toes I stepped on by not camping for tomahawks..<br/>\n&gt; oh my god. I guess I better go camp those items (with my new char), making<br/>\n&gt; everyone wait longer and the game less and less fun for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t automatically associate all the evils of camping rares to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; twink newbies with simply twinking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The alternative is to ignore the evils.  Rock and hard place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most people choose to shoot the occasional innocent rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than let the bad guy get away with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The alternative is to stop crying and whining over things that are most<br/>\n&gt; likely not hurting you and most likely do more good than harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your choice seems to be to shoot all the innocents just in case there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; bad guy in there. What an honorable decision, yes, you shot the bad guys..<br/>\n&gt; nevermind those people who are actually making the situation better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
