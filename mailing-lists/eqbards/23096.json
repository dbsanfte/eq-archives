Now this<br/>\ntends to make me think that farmers wont be selling them so the guardian<br/>\nones might just rot there.  Anyone have any idea if they&#39;re somewhat common<br/>\ndrops? I myself dont want to waste away my dragon faction but i&#39;m thinking<br/>\nif someone i camping the guardians they might not need belts.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering the sludge girdle stats and the other 2 belts stats, i&#39;d rather<br/>\ngo for save vs. magic instead of mana/int. Also considering how low my<br/>\nstamina is makes both sentry and guardian belts very attractive to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSludged Girdle 8ac   Cha +5, Int +5, HP +20, Mana +10   (worth 5-8k, lore<br/>\nand tradeable)<br/>\nSentry Girdle  10ac  Cha +5, Agi +8, HP +10, SV M +5    (lore, tradeable, no<br/>\nidea of worth)<br/>\nGuardian Girdle 12ac Cha +5, Sta +8, HP +10, SV M +5    (lore, no drop)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.
