","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1012002257\">I completely agree.... the Manasong can be both a blessing (groups love me now)<br/>\nand a curse (can you play manasong only please? Well no. Any other questions?)<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing some of the suggestions on this list I use the following for rules:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. If mana is below 40% I will play manasong and 1 other melee buff.<br/>\n2. If OOM (unless it&#39;s every fight then I tell them to manage there mana better)<br/>\nthen Manasong only if we are still fighting and need that nuke/healing<br/>\n3. Always weave mana and healing during downtime.... unless I need a break then<br/>\nstraight mana or healing depending on the situation.<br/>\n4. It&#39;s the casters job to stay in range of the song. I am not going to move<br/>\naround to get them in<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they don&#39;t like it tough... leave the group or do just what you did.... in a<br/>\nmelee heavy group last night (SK, Paladin, 2 Bards, Cleric and Shaman w/pet) I<br/>\nplayed mana (I was the low level bard) and the other Bard played melee buffs so<br/>\nthe casters could buff all of us.. then went to my melee bank until time to buff<br/>\nagain.. once we were Fully buffed we had 2 pullers and were chewing threw things<br/>\nin the Overthere (we staggered them. One mob almost dead go pull, other mob<br/>\nalmost dead go pull. It was non stop. Hell the Cleric got to nuke some even!).<br/>\nUntil we decided to go to the Sarnak ruins and the other bard had an AOE song up<br/>\nand aggroed a sarnak who promptly told all his friends. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW there is a spot in Overthere next to SF were the pathing is totally screwed<br/>\nup. We were fear kiting by there and the mobs just ran in to the wall. Kept fear<br/>\nup and killed them. Should I bug that or leave it to bad pathing? Reason I ask<br/>\nis I don&#39;t want to get in trouble for a bug exploit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone send me there downtime macro for weaving Mana and healing? I think I<br/>\nneed to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nRanian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n|--------+------------------------&gt;<br/>\n|        |          &quot;Stephen E.   |<br/>\n|        |          McCloskey&quot;    |<br/>\n|        |          &lt;s.mccloskey@i|<br/>\n|        |          ntest.com&gt;    |<br/>\n|        |                        |<br/>\n|        |          01/12/01 09:12|<br/>\n|        |          AM            |<br/>\n|        |          Please respond|<br/>\n|        |          to eqbards    |<br/>\n|        |                        |<br/>\n|--------+------------------------&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  |                                                                            |<br/>\n  |       To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>                                          |<br/>\n  |       cc:     (bcc: Chris Holden/Technology/Equifax)                       |<br/>\n  |       Subject:     Play the damn mana song (was: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to |<br/>\n  |       change how ...)                                                      |<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ugggg.  Last night was the first time someone actually said to me, &quot;just<br/>\nplay mana song&quot;.  I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted but I did.  I<br/>\ntold him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>\nmobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>\nI choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>\nit (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; enchanter if you<br/>\nwant constant mana regen.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n38 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Fortunately most groups don&#39;t actually<br/>\n&gt;threaten to kick me out when I refuse to just play manasong in actual<br/>\n&gt;combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;          Kit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
