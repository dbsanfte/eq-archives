I&#39;ll be the first<br/>\nto admit that a bard isn&#39;t as good at soloing as many other classes, but<br/>\nthere are few if any classes who can add as much to a group as a bard<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, if you look at a group in terms of one battle only many if not ALL<br/>\nclasses will contribute more than a bard.  Will a group do more damage<br/>\nin a battle if the last person added to the group is a bard, or a<br/>\nwarrior?  Or a wizard?  Will the group heal faster if the last person is<br/>\na druid or a bard?  Or a cleric or a bard?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut looking at things these ways are shortsighted.  Bards cut a groups<br/>\ndowntime by a HUGE factor, and less downtime means more kills per hour,<br/>\nand that&#39;s what matters to powergamers.  Bards also cut travel time. <br/>\nBards let a group bust camps.  I know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the<br/>\nchoir here, but these are the sorts of things you should tell those<br/>\n*ahem* stupid group leaders out there who don&#39;t want a bard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTell them that having you in the party compared to another wizard or<br/>\nanother tank will mean they&#39;ll get 20% more experience at the end of the<br/>\nnight.  Now if their wizards blow all their mana every fight, having a<br/>\nbard there isn&#39;t going to speed things up unless you&#39;re level 32, but<br/>\nyou get the principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t forget, there are plenty of group leaders out there who are<br/>\njust plain dumb.  You don&#39;t want to be in their groups anyway. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
