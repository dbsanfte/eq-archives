At <br/>\n&gt; the same time it also effects our DOT songs (lvls <br/>\n&gt; 2,18,30,38,46,49) after having int higher that 100 increases <br/>\n&gt; damage by 5%. I think the next magic number is around 120ish <br/>\n&gt; then 144ish. I have not been able to get enough int to test <br/>\n&gt; these. But at 99 and less int lvl 30 38 and 46 songs with <br/>\n&gt; selos drum played once in a twist does 315 dam at lvl 46. <br/>\n&gt; With 100 int it did 331. There are TWO songs at this point <br/>\n&gt; that use mana, lvl 39 charm and lvl 43 dirge. At lvl 43 a <br/>\n&gt; bard has just enough mana to play Dirge song once. <br/>\n&gt; BTW - most parts to the bard planer armor has a int bonus not <br/>\n&gt; a wis bonus. Hmmm... could be a hint :) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pinene Myrcene <br/>\n&gt; Lvl 48 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Leader of the Wandering Minstrels -- Bristalbain<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My primary offense these days is in songs - Chant series and <br/>\n&gt; when able the CoD, DDD, CoC medly - with planar/dragon <br/>\n&gt; instruments.  So, if int is a good boost then I am gonna rob <br/>\n&gt; my wizzy twink of his int gear!  &lt;j/k&gt; One reason I give some <br/>\n&gt; creedence to this is the blurb in the original user manual <br/>\n&gt; that said INT was a component in bard song effectiveness.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup<br/>\n&gt; Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.<br/>\n&gt; Install today:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4874/10/_/451022/_/959957009/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4874/10/_/451022/_/959957009/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
