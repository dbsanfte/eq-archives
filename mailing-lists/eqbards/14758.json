The rest <br/>\n&gt; of the group I was helping were mid 20&#39;s as I remember.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You&#39;re L36, so that would mean a L20 ice goblin would be green to <br/>\n  you for example.  If I dumped you into a room with 5 &#39;green&#39; ice<br/>\n  goblins, you&#39;ve got what? 850 hp?  L20 ice goblins hit for 44ish<br/>\n  dmg and double attack, thats around 8 toe to toe rounds before you&#39;d<br/>\n  be killed at best case.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Trust me, it gets worse.  L35/L36 mobs are &#39;green&#39; to a L50.<br/>\n  Hill giants are green to me.  So are spectres.  Grimfeather <br/>\n  is just barely blue.  All of these monsters can kill a L50<br/>\n  melee player toe to toe in no time at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So now you are a L50 paladin who has killed Shadowmen for sport<br/>\n  and you roll through one of their camps and pick up 5 shadowmen<br/>\n  (1 cleric, 2 wizards, and 3 warriors).  These L25 npcs move faster<br/>\n  than you do, can melee for 50ish damage, can cast for 150ish dmg,<br/>\n  and you&#39;ve got 1500 hp.  You cannot outrun them, you could turn <br/>\n  to fight, but then what - die like a man?  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once you get L40, most clops will be green to you, that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  mean you are gonna whup their ass ;p<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant really messed up the consideration/exp scale.  If something<br/>\n  can almost kill me, then I better damn get some experience from<br/>\n  it.  A L50 wizard can solo two hill giants at the same time with<br/>\n  root and ice comet.  A L50 shaman/mage/necro can too with their<br/>\n  pet.  It&#39;s easy for those people.  A warrior will never solo a<br/>\n  hill giant, neither will a ranger, rogue, paladin.  Sure I&#39;ve <br/>\n  seen rangers bow kiting giants... and I think /yawn that&#39;s gonna<br/>\n  take 15 mins.  We can do it with charm, but there is still lots <br/>\n  of risk involved.  It&#39;s not like you have a little snowflake button<br/>\n  on your screen that does 1110 dmg.  Or a pet that can outmelee<br/>\n  tanks of similar level.  To those classes those npcs should be<br/>\n  green.  To other classes they should be blue (formidable, not<br/>\n  you might win, because you will never win if you are one of the<br/>\n  common tanks).<br/>\n<br/>\n  5 shadowmen won&#39;t kill you as fast as one Solusek Kobold King<br/>\n  or ghoul lord, but they&#39;ll still kill you all the same ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
