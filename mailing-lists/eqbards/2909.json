I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>\n&gt;Quellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>\n&gt;extreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>\n&gt;desert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>\n&gt;as of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>\n&gt;intend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>\n&gt;wanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>\n&gt;my profession? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>\n&gt;reading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>\n&gt;about here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>\n&gt;all of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>\n&gt;of the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>\n&gt;affecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>\n&gt;would be well appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;Wynsong<br/>\n&gt;Wood Elf Bard, Level 3<br/>\n&gt;Rivervale, Quellious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just <br/>\n&gt;that ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt;ICQ#1976509<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
