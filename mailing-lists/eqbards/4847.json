If there were, you can rest assured that tidbit of<br/>\ninfo would get posted to this list.  The bard petition that was submitted a<br/>\nfew weeks back requested that Verant add magical instruments but so far the<br/>\nbattle drum is the only one in the game.  I have never heard of a harp<br/>\nexisting in the game but I haven&#39;t been in the bards guild since the last<br/>\npatch so don&#39;t know if it has been added or not.  Have you seen a harp in<br/>\ngame or were you using it as a hypothetical example?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was under the impression that the more &quot;advanced&quot; instruments (i.e. more<br/>\n&gt; expensive ones or ones found on monsters) would have a higher multiplier<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; songs.  Like a harp found on a creature would mean that healing went up<br/>\n&gt; higher than using a mandolin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
