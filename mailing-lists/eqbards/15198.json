A good list admin, like Talies t.W. will<br/>\ndo, well, just what he did.<br/>\nHeh, now I kinda miss the days when with a good set of headers, dejanews, a<br/>\nfew tricks and some some social engineering could play amature Net sleuth<br/>\nand actually catch the jerks. Gah, no more, too many people and too many<br/>\ntools now for it to be easy. (My best hunt was when a jerk  got the email<br/>\naddresses of some of the highest ranking people in my martial art, put em on<br/>\na mailing list and posted to rec.martial.arts the adress under the promise:<br/>\n&quot;Talk to real live ninjas!&quot;.
