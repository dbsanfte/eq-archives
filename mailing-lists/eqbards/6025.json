I was in level 22 for about 2 weeks and the same for 23.<br/>\nWhat you need to do is to get into a good group in Unrest that is camping<br/>\nthe barroom or the Hand room.  The xp is great and the spawn is pretty<br/>\nfrequent.  And you will find that the group will love you to death.  The<br/>\nlast few days that I spent in there have enlightened a lot of people to<br/>\nthe value of a bard in a party.  Many times I either replaced a departing<br/>\nwarrior or caster and the group has exclaimed after the continuous battles<br/>\nthat this is the best group that they have been in.  Hehe it&#39;s good to see<br/>\npeople learn the powers of a bard =).  So persevere, you&#39;ll need some good<br/>\ngroups to get you out of level 22, 23 is bit easier.  Getting past 24<br/>\nseemed easy for me, since a majority of the MOBs in the 2nd floor con even<br/>\nand below.  BTW my bad luck came without prepurchasing a song.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver (finally 25th level)<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 3 Sep 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, I have been &quot;stuck&quot; in level 22 for a good long week now.
