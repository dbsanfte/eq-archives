We are players.<br/>\nWe pay $10 per month just like you.  The players who played there and got to<br/>\nhigh levels SPECIFICALLY so that they could test high level<br/>\ndungeons/areas/planes/dragons were basically paying verant for the<br/>\npriveledge of doing their jobs for them.  People that played on test<br/>\nreligiously (I&#39;m not talking about the 5 day wonders that would level to<br/>\n17th then go back to a live server) were very religious testers.  Most of us<br/>\nhave been testing this game since Beta 2 or earlier.  Many of those folks<br/>\nhave now left in disgust over their treatment by Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO:  Anyone who played on Test should have been playing for free instead<br/>\nof paying $10 bucks a month.  Just my opinion though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave you with this thought:<br/>\nIf there weren&#39;t level 50 players to test the planes, dragons, kunark,<br/>\netc... how stable would those zones be on the live servers?  Hope you enjoy<br/>\nfalling through the world for 32,000 dmg when walking across the plane of<br/>\nhate.  I&#39;ve had it happen.  Have you?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
