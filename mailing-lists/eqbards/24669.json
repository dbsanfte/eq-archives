Yes, we DO pass down most items that<br/>\npeople remember.  For example, I got a lodizal shield last night which means<br/>\nI pass down my dragonscale cloak.  Most often things get passed down but say<br/>\nyou have a good haste item on your back, and win another that goes on your<br/>\nhead and wear that one... and if the haste item on your back isn&#39;t really an<br/>\nIMPROVEMENT for anyone else, they just kinda &quot;keep it&quot;... thats what gets to<br/>\nme. but its also very tough to enforce.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 09, 2001 6:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t these weapons and armors pass down the line when they <br/>\n&gt; get new ones?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 3:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Honestly for me its because since the release of Kunark and <br/>\n&gt; Velious, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seen our warriors and rogues outfitted in a dozen or more different<br/>\n&gt; weapons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each, approximately 3 sets of new armor and a dozen &quot;uber&quot; <br/>\n&gt; items while the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casters (especially int casters) sit around in jumpy and <br/>\n&gt; mana robes (which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in case you dont know really aren&#39;t goo).
