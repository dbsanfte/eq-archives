I found that area very annoying so I suggest <br/>\n     that you dash through BB (it&#39;s a fairly safe short run at peak time <br/>\n     when all the surface gnolls are camped.) and get yourself bound in <br/>\n     Halas.  Then hunt the various Ice goblin camps and the edges of the <br/>\n     open area for possible blue/white critters.  It&#39;s a beautiful zone and <br/>\n     the snow makes it easier to see in the dark.<br/>\n     <br/>\n        If you feel like some travel to a very empty zone take the ship to <br/>\n     Eurdin, work your way through the city to the Tox forest.  As you come <br/>\n     out the gate head straight south through the newbie zone till you hit <br/>\n     the bridge that crosses the river (roughly 0 100), cross and hunt the <br/>\n     kobald camps and poachers (their heads are a good quest item at your <br/>\n     level.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Just a couple of suggestion, there are many other areas.  Umm actually <br/>\n     if you feel rally brave you can sprint to Misty Thicket near <br/>\n     Rivervale. I think it is the best place to level up to 10-12th in the <br/>\n     game.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold 18th<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Suggestions for a level 6 baby bard<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-Talien (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talien@...\">Talien@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    7/23/99 11:37 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Talien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talien@...\">Talien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nHeya,<br/>\n     <br/>\nYou fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on where to hunt? <br/>\nIm was born in, and live around the Qeynos area.
