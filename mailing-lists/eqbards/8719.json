He didn&#39;t know anymore details<br/>\nbut told me that the person who told him was a reliable source.  He and I<br/>\nhave grouped since we were level 5 so I know he would have told me more info<br/>\nhad he known it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this just another EQ rumor or is it possibly true?  I have only looted a<br/>\nblack pearl once.  I got it off a barbed bone skeleton in Unrest. I and<br/>\neveryone else in my group was quite surprised when I got it.  Everyone was<br/>\nunder the impression that barbed bones never dropped anything except cash.<br/>\nI have also heard that avocets will sometimes drop a black pearl.  I have<br/>\ngotten some type of jewel every time I have looted an avocet so I am<br/>\ninclined to believe they will drop a black pearl as a rare drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can confirm this rumor but don&#39;t want to give out the secret, a<br/>\nsimple confirmation will suffice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
