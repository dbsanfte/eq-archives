When<br/>\nthey root me they force me to take advantage of an exploit if I am already<br/>\nplaying accelerando at the time, because if its a bug when it breaks me free<br/>\nif it pulses I exploit if I keep singing and if its a bug that it break the<br/>\nRoot when the song stops I exploit if I do not keep singing.  Nothing I can<br/>\ndo reasonably will prevent accelerando from breaking the Root at the point<br/>\nthey cast it on me if I am already singing.  If its an exploit, its one I<br/>\ncannot avoid at the point except to just stand there when it gets broken.<br/>\nThat I think would be unreasonable.  Not that that puts it out of Verant&#39;s<br/>\nvenue by any means.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly trip home due to snow in 8 minutes here in Denver, woohoo!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: M Sanford (Maev) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 03, 1999 7:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Un-Broken Song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;M Sanford (Maev)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, well if Verant did truly intend Selo&#39;s to break root, they sure did<br/>\na sloppy job with it.<br/>\nWhen you cure a disease, or dispel a buff, etc the appropriate icon and<br/>\neffect is taken off to indicate this effect has been cancelled. Not so<br/>\nwith Selo&#39;s breaking root, so it would appear to be buggy. And as for<br/>\nsitting there being rooted after you zone, thats just ridiculous.<br/>\nEither A) Verant is quite sloppy with their intentions for Selo&#39;s to<br/>\nbreak root, or B) Its just a bug.<br/>\nChoice A wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all.. I mean this is Verant afterall.<br/>\nBut I&#39;m inclined to believe choice B.<br/>\nNow technically if its marked as a bug and you use it.. this is<br/>\nexploiting. But as if Verant would care. So don&#39;t be a jerk and say<br/>\nstuff like &quot;oh we should all be banned!&quot;<br/>\nAnyways.. think my point is that the way its currently designed now, it<br/>\ncannot be ruled out as a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
