I have better gloves in the bank (black enameled something or<br/>\nother ...I forget, another guild gift) and I think I&#39;ve got a better hat<br/>\ntoo, but I can&#39;t wear them as I&#39;ve got only ~10 pounds to spare for loot<br/>\ndressed as is.

Confused<br/>\nnewbies would see me playing a lute and comment &quot;I thought bards could wear<br/>\nanything&quot;.  I&#39;d wander through the streets of Freeport and hear &quot;May I give<br/>\nyou some copper please?&quot; coming out my speakers!  On the other hand getting<br/>\nfree & unsolicited SoW&#39;s everytime I walked in or out of a city was kinda<br/>\nnice.
