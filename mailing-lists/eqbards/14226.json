I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>\nexit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>\ndubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>\nindifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell. His response was different, though,<br/>\nsaying that he doesn&#39;t talk to Half-Elves, much less sell to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have lost faction a while back when someone pulled Krak down to the<br/>\nramp and I whacked on him before I knew who he was. Think I was still in the<br/>\nzone when he died.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can still sell to centaurs, so no worries. Just curious about others&#39;<br/>\nexperience with Krak boy and Carillon not doing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Wed, 2 Feb 2000 16:48:18 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n   From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Mask of Deception and ultravision<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 2 Feb 2000, Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You would sing carillon first before sneaking.
