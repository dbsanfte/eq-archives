They were destroyed before I ever even <br/>\n&gt; got to try them<br/>\n&gt; on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I sent email to the customer service manager at Verant.  I <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t waste the<br/>\n&gt; space reproducing it here unless requested to, but I <br/>\n&gt; attempted to make it<br/>\n&gt; intelligent and constructive but I did color it with my anger <br/>\n&gt; and aggrevation<br/>\n&gt; at the loss when it occurred.  I asked what the appropriate <br/>\n&gt; venue was to air<br/>\n&gt; my complaint (i.e. who to send further email to) about this <br/>\n&gt; loss for possible<br/>\n&gt; restoration, and stated that I agreed with the logic behind <br/>\n&gt; LORE.  I then<br/>\n&gt; asked what the logic was of having LORE items destroyed when dropped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This was his reply to me:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear Jason,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assume you purchased a ONE claw? They are lore items so it would be<br/>\n&gt; impossible to possess two. I will direct the server GM to <br/>\n&gt; return you one<br/>\n&gt; claw. In the near future we are changing the code to not <br/>\n&gt; destroy lore items<br/>\n&gt; when they are dropped. You will see that information on the <br/>\n&gt; patch server<br/>\n&gt; message when it is ready.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry for your distress and inconvenience!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you say HOT DAMN!  It would appear that I&#39;m going to get <br/>\n&gt; my Claw restored<br/>\n&gt; to me.  I got this email this morning, so it&#39;s unlikely that <br/>\n&gt; the Claw is<br/>\n&gt; actually restored to me yet but I&#39;ll be checking first thing <br/>\n&gt; when I get home<br/>\n&gt; tonight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I replied to him briefly saying basically &#39;Many will be <br/>\n&gt; relieved when LORE<br/>\n&gt; items are not destroyed when dropped.&#39;, and thanking him for <br/>\n&gt; his unexpected<br/>\n&gt; restoration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier - a very happy 18th song Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; Yoyodyne - 23rd level monk on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason A.
