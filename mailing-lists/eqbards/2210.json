Sometimes the code awards the loot randomly for<br/>\nsome reason, but the majority of the time it awards the kill to the person<br/>\nwho does the most damage overall.  I can personally verify this from my<br/>\ntime in the CB tower.  Besides, the funniest thing I saw was my lvl 20 wiz<br/>\nfriend back when he was level 14 or so blasting Crush with his spell for<br/>\n8dmg and getting the kill and the loot.  Sometimes it is not perfect, but<br/>\nit is still flawed IMHO.  There is no way that a caster that does 200 dmg<br/>\nshould get teh kill over a group of 6 melee people who do 150dmg each.<br/>\nThat is unfair if one group does 900dmg and one guy does 200 and he get&#39;s<br/>\nthe kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
