I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking for a NEW zone that a Level 23 bard can successfully solo - AND GAIN<br/>\nEXP - without spending a lot of time on CR&#39;s.  I&#39;ve been hunting in Dagnor&#39;s<br/>\nCauldron on Veeshan but the goblins are far between and it&#39;s been slow<br/>\ngoing.  One advantage (or disadvantage) is the zone is ALWAYS empty, only<br/>\npeeps passing to Estate of Unrest ever appear.  I&#39;ve had troubles hooking up<br/>\nwith friends due to RL hours and stuff so grouping if kindof out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been travelling to BB and GF to help out the newbies and work on my<br/>\nskills but the experience isn&#39;t there.  I&#39;ve been to SK and LoIO which was<br/>\nfairly successful, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone of similar level.  But I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking for something NEW!  --  Any suggestions?  Locations?  Just drawing<br/>\non all you highbies overwhelming knowledge.. /bows.<br/>\n--<br/>\nAlso -- as I recommended to my guildies.. make sure you change the<br/>\nEQCLIENT.INI file to support DirectX8 and log into the Test Server to make<br/>\nsure you&#39;re system requirements are up to snuff.  I had an older system that<br/>\nwas running XP on a 3Dfx board (no current drivers available due to<br/>\nout-of-business) and it choked when I tried this.  Directions for making the<br/>\nchange are in the patch message (you DID read them, right?).  The update to<br/>\nDirectX8 will happen whether you upgrade to SoL or not, better to test now<br/>\nand get the bugs worked out then the day they make the switch over.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp..<br/>\n<br/>\nBard-on dudes (and dudettes).<br/>\n<br/>\n~Drewt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
