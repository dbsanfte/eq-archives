The AC for the SS is 6 better than SotA, but the SotA provide STR<br/>\nand CHR bonuses while the SS has no stat bonuses.  I have been waiting until<br/>\nI dinged 50 before I started to hunt in Sebilis.  Well I dinged 50 this<br/>\nweekend so plan to start going there soon.  Now I have heard that SS arms<br/>\nare not that hard to acquire in Seb.  So I am debating if I should buy the<br/>\nSS arms now or wait until I can loot them for myself.  The 2K will clean me<br/>\nout so would prefer to loot them instead of buying them.  But if they are<br/>\nharder to acquire than what I was told, then I may decide to fork out the<br/>\ncash.  For those of you with a lot of experience fighting in Seb, would like<br/>\nto hear what you have to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
