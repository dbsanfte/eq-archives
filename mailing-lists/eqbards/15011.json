I expressed the opinion that it<br/>\nwould be unlikely based on my own experiences at level 23.  The thread also<br/>\ndiscussed whether Selo&#39;s could be successfully used on the island.  I<br/>\nexpressed the opinion that it would cause too much damage because of the<br/>\nrough terrain.  I was wrong on both counts.  Let me tell you how I found out<br/>\nI was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lost level 23 due to a bad pull by a spec hunting party on the island a<br/>\nfew nights ago.  I decided to try the gargoyles anyway since I was there.  I<br/>\nfound that I could take them using an all instrument attack provided they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get too many resist on the DDD.  Even so the fight usually ended with<br/>\nme having about a bubble of health left.  After killing two gargs I regained<br/>\nlevel 23.  I then started to kill a 3rd and I had him down to about a third<br/>\nhealth while I was about a bubble ahead of him, when a 2nd gargoyle joined<br/>\nthe fight.  In desperation I cranked up Selo&#39;s and ran.  I found that if I<br/>\npaid careful attention and turned with the shoreline I took almost no<br/>\ndamage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI twisted Selo&#39;s and Hymn until I was a little better than 1/2 health and<br/>\nturned to kill the first garg then run again.  When I turned around the<br/>\nfirst two had been joined by another two!  Whoo boy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was bound and determined I wasn&#39;t going to see level 22 again, so I<br/>\nstarted Selo&#39;s back up and turned and ran.  I continued to twist Selo&#39;s and<br/>\nHymn until I was back to full health.  Then I gave a tell to a friend of<br/>\nmine, a level 25 ranger, who happened to be in Freeport.  I asked if he<br/>\ncould give me a hand.  He said sure and headed for the boat.  In the<br/>\nmeantime I started using Bellow on the first garg.  I found that with Selo&#39;s<br/>\nI was moving too fast to stay in range and let Selo&#39;s drop.  It turns out<br/>\nthat gargs fly at the same speed that we run, so I just kept up a normal run<br/>\nand bellowed until garg number one bit the dust.  I then started in on garg<br/>\nnumber two and he was almost dead when my friend arrived.  He snared garg<br/>\nnumber three and meleed it while I finished off garg number two.  I then<br/>\nturned and he and I dispatched garg number four.  My guildmate couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve I survived the incident.  I felt pretty good about it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my apologies for the misinformation that I expressed in the earlier<br/>\nthread.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin Loreweaver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
