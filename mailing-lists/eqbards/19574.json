MM Drum slides thru crack in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1053134510\">I thought I&#39;d share my sob story with the list:<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe not the whole story as you all have heard it a thousand <br/>\ntimes... <br/>\n<br/>\nMM Drum slides thru crack in Hotkeys and promptly poofs when it hits <br/>\nthe ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of messing around in MM (I ended up starting a doozy of a <br/>\ntrain exploring with the never reliable invis), I decided to go for <br/>\nthe Nostrolo Tamborine.  So, I thought I&#39;d share my successes with <br/>\nthose who might want to grab it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tamborine is NO DROP but the coins aren&#39;t, meaning all those <br/>\nlittle coins are worthless to anyone holding them, unless they&#39;re a <br/>\nBard!  Remember this. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 6 coins.  <br/>\n1 is in Lake of Ill Omen on the bloodgill goblins who you can find <br/>\nunder each of the platforms in the lake.  Pretty common drop from a <br/>\nVERY common mob.  <br/>\n2 is foraged in the Emerald Jungle.  I hit forage twice before <br/>\nsomeone answered my shout for it.<br/>\n3 is in City of Mist on the Captain of the Guard.  A friend gave me <br/>\nthis coin, so I don&#39;t know how hard this one is to get.  A shout to <br/>\nthe zone will probably turn up something before long.<br/>\n4 is in Kaesora.  This one appears more difficult as the Failed <br/>\nRaider is pretty rare.  I bought the coin from a guy camping down <br/>\nthere who had 4 coins.<br/>\n5 is in Dalnir on the Kly Implicator.  I found a guy in Warsilkwoods <br/>\nat the zone to Dalnir who had 3 coins.  He was destroying them as he <br/>\nhad so many.  I think I&#39;m going to go back into Dalnir to explore a <br/>\nbit as this zone looks pretty fun.<br/>\n6 is on a Scorp (sp?) Scrounger in The Overthere.  In the middle of <br/>\nthe zone there is a large ravine.  There are tons of Scorp things and <br/>\na few scroungers scattered throughout.  They&#39;re all casters making it <br/>\ntough to solo, but their aggro ranges are real small, allowing you to <br/>\nisolate 1 fairly easy.  I tried dots, melee, and charming methods <br/>\nbefore getting my GF&#39;s Mage to come over and help.  Fairly easy kill <br/>\nwith a 51 Earth pet beating the crap out of them.  First drop, 1 <br/>\ncoin.  Had a difficult time finding anyone with a coin or even anyone <br/>\nwho knew where they dropped in this zone, so getting it yourself is <br/>\nprobably the best bet.  Luckily, it&#39;s probably the easiest to get <br/>\nyourself. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... don&#39;t be intimidated by this quest if you&#39;re without a MM Drum <br/>\nor even if you have one.  If you can get to the zone, you can <br/>\nprobably find someone to sell or give you the coin in no time.  And <br/>\nnot only does the Tamborine have a slightly higher effect than the MM <br/>\nDrum you also won&#39;t be dropping it.  Ever. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Anyone on Xegony who would like the coin from Dalnir (I have 2 <br/>\nextras) gimme a tell in game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
