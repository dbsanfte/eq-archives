For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-38370993\">I have also followed a similar strategy to acquire the quest components.  So<br/>\nfar I have eight pieces but have yet to find anyone selling a lambent stone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past two weeks, I have been hanging out in MM trying to get a lute.<br/>\nI guess my timing has been bad because the times I have been online, none of<br/>\nthe higher level characters are camping the music room where the gypsies<br/>\nspawn.  As a 26th level bard, the furthest into MM I have gone is the<br/>\ncourtyard and the secret room with four doors near the graveyard.  I know<br/>\nwhere the secret walls are that lead up into the castle but have not dared<br/>\nto go any further (I assume that mobs will see through my invis song if I go<br/>\nupstairs).  Would appreciate it if someone can give me directions to the<br/>\nmusic(piano) room from the secret room just in case someone finds a gypsy<br/>\nlute and is willing to give it away or sell the looting rights. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times while camping besides the lake, massive trains will go by heading<br/>\nto the zone.  I&#39;ve sat there and watched to see if any gypsies are part of<br/>\nthe train.  So far there haven&#39;t been any.  I am beginning to believe that<br/>\nparties have no incentive to camp the music room if a bard isn&#39;t in the<br/>\nparty.  As a result, I am contemplating leaving MM and only returning when I<br/>\nam 32d level.  At that point, I can offer to be a mana bard in exchange for<br/>\nthe parties agreeing to help me get the gypsy lute.  I think that is<br/>\nprobably the best course of action because I can&#39;t get the lambent<br/>\nbreastplate until I also get the basalt carapace.  Once again, my chances of<br/>\nfinding a party to help me get the basalt carapace are much better if I can<br/>\nsing the mana song.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing concerning the basalt carapace.  Last night in MM another<br/>\nbard was auctioning to purchase looting rights for a basalt carapace.  I<br/>\ntold him that they were found on the gargoyles in Lower Guk.  He told me<br/>\nthat they could also be looted off the tougher gargoyles in MM.  I have<br/>\nnever heard of anyone getting a basalt carapace in MM.   Can anyone confirm<br/>\nif this is a possibility.  I do know for a fact that the black silk gloves<br/>\nare dropped by mobs other than the deathly usher.  I have personally seen a<br/>\ndeathly aegis and a deathly harbinger drop the gloves.  I guess its possible<br/>\nthat the basalt carapace can be dropped by mobs other than those told to you<br/>\nby the quest giver in Solusek temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually I have been hunting parts for lambent armor since it where added.<br/>\n&gt; Until now I have:<br/>\n&gt; 1 lambent stone, bought for 30pp.<br/>\n&gt; 1 Shin greavers<br/>\n&gt; 1 Shin gauntlets<br/>\n&gt; I looted the shin stuff in LGuk with help of some of my higher level<br/>\n&gt; friends/guild, but I would not think that it would be to hard to get them<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; just going there and waiting. Got the gaunts from another person who did a<br/>\n&gt; /shout Gaunts to loot at entrance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 Dark bracelet (sp?)<br/>\n&gt; The Dark bracelet was aquired during my normal fighting in Unrest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Currently I am trying to get the Icy greavers, but my main problem is that<br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; one on Bertox seems to hunt in Perma during my normal playing hours<br/>\n&gt; (evenings<br/>\n&gt; CET around 8-12PST), but getting to king room is not a problem if someone<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; keeping the area around the first gate clear. Anyone else notice that<br/>\n&gt; invisio<br/>\n&gt; seems to fail EVERY time you get near it (Atleast it did when I was 23<br/>\n&gt; havent<br/>\n&gt; tried at 24 yet)?<br/>\n&gt; Well I was in one group who camped the king room for some time and it was<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; tough to hold for a group of level 23-30 or so people with the right<br/>\n&gt; pulling<br/>\n&gt; strategi.<br/>\n&gt; When I get the icy&#39;s I will be of to MM again to try and get the gloves<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; lute. Or maybe the karanas to get a griffene charm.<br/>\n&gt; So dont give up. You can get the stuff with a bit of help. Just give<br/>\n&gt; yourself<br/>\n&gt; time to get to know the zones where the items is - and how to get there.<br/>\n&gt; Using your invisio song you can go far in on your own to get the loot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
