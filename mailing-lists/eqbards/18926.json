A lute tuner (I forget the exact item name), is now sold by the <br/>\nvendor inside the guild. It looks like a lute. I had previously found an npc <br/>\nin Firiona Vie who sells 2 parts of a lute and 2 parts of a flute. This is <br/>\nlike the trumpet parts that are sold, I think in EC or N Ro. I have never <br/>\nheard of anyone that knows how to assemble these pieces. I hail&#39;ed all the <br/>\nbards in the FP guild with predicatable results, only the mail quest. I <br/>\nwonder if these things can be crafted via a trade skill or are for quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest newbie beg: I have gotten tells twice now from bards under L10 <br/>\nasking if I would mind getting them a set of lambent armor. That would be <br/>\ntaking generosity to new heights.<br/>\n<br/>\nL51! woohoo travel song is fun, but pulling with it even sung kills pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
