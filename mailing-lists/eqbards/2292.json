Highpass basically is a place for mages and wizards to<br/>\n&gt;camp and kill things and sell the special weapons to the melee<br/>\n&gt;types who could easily have killed the mobs themselves if the<br/>\n&gt;mages and wizards weren&#39;t there.  Come to think of it, most<br/>\n&gt;places are like this, but nothing exemplifies it more than<br/>\n&gt;Highpass (well, maybe Crush&#39;s tower in Crushbone).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t mind this so much if there were named mobs who<br/>\n&gt;carried nice mage-type items and were so resistant to magic<br/>\n&gt;that you needed to melee to kill it.
