If you ve got a good pull team, you don t have to worry about trains","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-899145410\">Playing songs during a pull is a risk in hate, the reason being the<br/>\npotential for trains. If you&#39;ve got a good pull team, you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry about trains after the first patrollers and 2 houses are cleared.<br/>\nWhat actually happens though is if a pull comes in, and you are doing<br/>\nparty buffs and a monster trains in late, look at it&#39;s aggro list..&#39;I<br/>\nsee 24 people here, I hate them all, but I see 3 people that are buffing<br/>\nthe rest like mad, boy this pisses me off!&#39; And those 3 would be bards<br/>\nplaying Verses of Victory for example. So that monster will run in and<br/>\nbeat each bard to death if it can. 1 monster generally isn&#39;t going to<br/>\nkill you so fast that your cleric can&#39;t heal you (unless it&#39;s an<br/>\nabhorrent/scareling with some nice backstabs) but more likely than not a<br/>\ntrain in Hate will consist of 4-5 monsters, and they will kill you from<br/>\n2000 hp to dead in about 2 seconds. What I&#39;d recommend for both Hate and<br/>\nFear, is to not play any party buffs until enough time has elapsed that<br/>\nany train coming would have arrived (say 30 seconds after the pull comes<br/>\nin).<br/>\nA bard in the puller&#39;s group can be very good and bad, it depends on the<br/>\nbard&#39;s skill level and experience. Pros are, the puller&#39;s team<br/>\ncleric/clerics will also be better off on mana, but there are several<br/>\nways for a bard to pull a train into the group if they don&#39;t know when<br/>\nto buff and when not to. I&#39;m not sure if anyone still uses a single<br/>\npuller in Hate, we always use a pull team. It&#39;s not the primary puller<br/>\nthat soaks up all the healing mana, it&#39;s the secondary puller that<br/>\nbrings it into a room.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other tidbit - aggro plays a large part in these zones on your<br/>\nlevel. so if you go up at L46 play very conservatively. Oh, and expect<br/>\nto die several times. Even in the best groups and the most skilled bards<br/>\nare going to leave a few corpses. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
