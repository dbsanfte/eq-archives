And to a degree, once you have a<br/>\nsufficient enough throwing skill, this could be the factor that tips the<br/>\nscales in favor of coming out of melee, wielding an instrument & playing<br/>\nyour songs instead of staying in the fight & singing.  You can still throw<br/>\nweapons while playing an instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Unfortunately raising thrown weapons is terribly slow, and now at 23rd<br/>\nlevel I think it&#39;s probably too late for me to start trying to raise this<br/>\nskill to an acceptable level.
