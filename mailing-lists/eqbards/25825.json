Factor in cast times, and song duration after it ends,<br/>\nand when twisting 4 songs, almost always, the first effect will drop before<br/>\nyou get back to it.  You can add amplification to a 4 song twist, and call<br/>\nit 5, but when it comes time to refresh amplification, you&#39;ll probably lose<br/>\nan effect just as you&#39;re trying to twist it back in, resulting in a catch up<br/>\neffect where a song wears off a pulse or two before it can be refreshed, all<br/>\nthe way through the twist, so you&#39;ve only got 3 songs active anyway, not<br/>\ncounting amplification.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if anyone ever actually defined &quot;twisting&quot;.  To me, it is the<br/>\nability to keep the effects of multiple songs **active** on my group, or on<br/>\nthe mob, at ALL times.  A 3 song twist is common among high level bards (am<br/>\nI a high level bard now?  :P ).  Why?  Because we&#39;ve been playing the class<br/>\nlong enough to realize that, under most circumstances, it is the best twist.<br/>\nSome song lineups, and situations make a 4 song twist desired, and while<br/>\npossible, it&#39;s a lot harder, and is only practical when the occassional<br/>\ndropped effect isn&#39;t that big a deal.  Like manasong, which is a shot of<br/>\nmana when pulsed, and not a regen effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when you&#39;re talking a song effect dropping for a duration of time, which<br/>\nis what would happen in a 5 song twist...well, it&#39;s not really a twist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you insist it is, then I&#39;d like to be the first to introduce myself as<br/>\nthe best bard in EQ, because I can twist 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n/bow<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: KAZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kazvorpal@...\">kazvorpal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 14, 2002 8:17 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] twisting 5, added note<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Michael Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MikeRoach@...\">MikeRoach@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A great bard does not need to twist 5 songs.

Period. One plus one<br/>\nequals two, no matter how embarassing it may be to those with only one.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
