The xp you gain back in 10 minutes after dying<br/>\nis tiny, what is the point of bind of wanting bind?<br/>\n<br/>\nMore responses below:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you make some valid points, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t agree where<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bards are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; concerned.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Time is money.  Time is experience.  If I am bound 5 seconds away from my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;current position, I can fight a lot more riskier and gain a lot more xp<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;if I am bound 10 minutes away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is only true if you don&#39;t die, as exp loss from a single death will<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wipe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out many kills.  I usually lose 1/2 hour to an hour&#39;s worth of exp from a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>death.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you don&#39;t die, then you didn&#39;t need the bind anyway, so you could have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>killed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the same amount of stuff with, or without it.  If you DO die, then saving<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 10 minutes isn&#39;t going to let you get back that lost exp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What Bind will get you, is letting you play for that 10 minutes, rather<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; run.  But the exp loss will be the same.  The amount of exp you can get in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>10<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; minutes is a tiny, tiny fraction of what you lose by dying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me rephrase what you said:<br/>\nYou die, and lose 1/2 hour to an hours worth of time.<br/>\nBinding &quot;close&quot; lets you play for 10 more minutes.<br/>\nThis 10 minutes is a tiny tiny fraction of what you lose.<br/>\n10 minutes is 1/3 of a half hour.  33% is a tiny tiny fraction?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Our songs do not FORCE us to attract attention.  Bellow all the way.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Save<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the healing song for downtime reduction.  It can be done if your current<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group is not adequate to protect you from harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You are correct that you can play without singing AOE songs.  However,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>since<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that limits you to  5 percent of our songlist, it stops you from being a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bard.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To limit yourself to Bellow and Warsong in a group makes you a dual<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wielding<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enchanter/cleric/shaman who has decided to &#39;tank&#39;.  Very unproductive.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that, you&#39;ve stopped being a Bard.  I don&#39;t think a good solution is to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>say,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just don&#39;t play songs...  I doubt that a mob with 5K worth of hps cares<br/>\n </span></blockquote>much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about my 15 points of bellow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I said a bard should not attract attention if the group the bard is in<br/>\ncannot protect the bard.  MOST groups I get in CAN adequately protect the<br/>\nbard.  Some can&#39;t.  You have to adapt or you will not make it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, no group can protect you if you are doing your job, buffing and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>healing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and whatnot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Completely disagree.  There are definitely bard happy groups and bard happy<br/>\nzones.  Work to your advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tanks can get the attention of the target mob, but all others<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will be on you.  The only protection you can get is to have your enchanter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AOE<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mez all of the time, and that still prevents you from DoT&#39;ing,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lullabye&#39;ing,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; etc.  I don&#39;t think a good solution for this is to stop using the songs<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; define our class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mind the dying, I mind not playing as much because I run back so<br/>\n </span></blockquote>much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more often than anyone else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;When a warrior dies, he has no sow, he has no invisibility, he has no<br/>\n </span></blockquote>summon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;corpse spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is true. But, to compensate he dies much less often than a Bard does.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you recall my original post, I say that adding Parry would move us from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Caster class to a true Hybrid class.  That would mean that we should not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bind, as we have the defensive powers of a melee class.  There&#39;s a reason<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the casters get bind and a warrior doesn&#39;t.  We&#39;re just on the wrong side<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that classification.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bards aren&#39;t that bad off, at all.  Bards are the best non-binder at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;to the corpse and returning to a safe point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s very true, in both cases.  We are a fine class, and I think not<br/>\n&gt; underpowered at all.  We are also great at safely returning.  However,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>none of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; us can return to our bodies instantly.  We lose time no matter what,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>during that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; run.  Since we die the most often, we lose the most time.  Make us die<br/>\n </span></blockquote>less with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; added defensive skills, or reduce our running time with Bind.  But one or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other needs to be done to make our downtime the same as the other 13<br/>\n </span></blockquote>classes in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, I&#39;ve heard some say that using a 29th or higher cleric to res you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; answer.  But really, if that were true, nobody at all should get bind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Golias&#39; Mantra!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No power increases, no gate.  No reduction of deaths, which result in more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>exp<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; loss than others.  Just bind to let us play the same amount of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Golias, Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seriously downplay the value of bind... why do yo want it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a singer not a fighter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
