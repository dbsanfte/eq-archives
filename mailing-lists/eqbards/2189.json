Is that an outdoor zone?  What levels is it good for?<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMistmoore&#39;s funky-good for me right now at 22. Not gotten bored of it yet <br/>\neither :P It&#39;s outdoors - which is handy - and the real badass stuff is <br/>\ntucked away in the graveyard further back (and in the castle beyond, but we <br/>\nwon&#39;t talk about *that* ;) so you can pick on a bunch of Initiates that are <br/>\nblue, white (black) or yellow to me and the occasional yellow or red <br/>\ngargoyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say it&#39;s a mid 20&#39;s+ lvl dungeon. I seldom see anyone my level, not to <br/>\nblow my own mino horn though - it&#39;s probably just cuz they assume it&#39;s not <br/>\ngood for them. A group of low 20&#39;s could quite feasibly do really well <br/>\nthere. Most people are 25-35 lv there, and they&#39;re not going any further <br/>\nthan the graveyard most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you&#39;ve got the main area cleared out and want tougher stuff, you can <br/>\npull from the pass or graveyard where the critters sure yield mighty <br/>\namounts of xp. You can even camp the graveyard, which can be fun in a <br/>\ndangerous and nerve-wracking way. But the key to survival is grouping. This <br/>\nis a nasty high-level dungeon, I&#39;ve only scratched the surface of it and <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen WAY too many crazy-tough trains run past me on many many <br/>\noccasions caused by people getting in too deep over their heads. These <br/>\ntrains come out and create a zone-wide swathe of destruction and chaos, <br/>\nconsuming everything in their vicious path. Everything... apart from the <br/>\nbard and his or her party, who can calmly watch it all transpire as they <br/>\nsit... little globes of pulsing invisibility, marvelling at the show. Even <br/>\nthe highest level nasty impgypsyvampireglyphpsycho has yet to see through <br/>\nmy invis. Yet ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the group question though: As a Bard I initially found it hard to <br/>\nreally justify my presence there and I died a whole bunch. I still die <br/>\nevery time I stupidly try to solo or fight in small, unbalanced groups. <br/>\nI&#39;ve grouped with 30th lvl people, and 20th lvl people, gotten xp on all <br/>\noccasions and I learned that it&#39;s suicide to attempt it at my level without <br/>\na solid group of mid level 20s people with a full complement of tanks, <br/>\ncasters and healers. So if you go, don&#39;t do anything until you&#39;ve got a <br/>\ngood group, that&#39;s my advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more people I know now the easier it is to find a group so things are <br/>\nbetter now and I think I&#39;ve established the use of a Bard. We&#39;re not <br/>\nstunningly amazing in these situations, but I&#39;m not unhappy either. I&#39;m <br/>\ndishing out a whoooole bunch of damage these days, piercing for 12 three <br/>\ntimes in a row and slashing once for .. er.. something (sorry), along with <br/>\na bellow actually damages things pretty effectively when compared to a high <br/>\n20&#39;s Paladin or Ranger wielding a BBC or something similar. They sometimes <br/>\nlet loose with mammoth combos, but they also swing helluva slow and miss a <br/>\nlot so sometimes I reckon I may well do more damage than these fellows. <br/>\nProbably my imagination though ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby and Lament have come in very handy, although sometimes I really <br/>\nregret using them - I take a serious beating in this place... which is why <br/>\nI love Clerics so much. A good cleric is ... well.. amazing. But that&#39;s not <br/>\nrelevant, so I&#39;ll hush about that. ;) As I mentioned, the invis song can be <br/>\nof great use... you can finish off whatever you&#39;re fighting as the hardcore <br/>\nnasties run to the zone chasing some careless fool... invis yourself and <br/>\nwatch &#39;em all walk back. Then start taking advantage of the time people <br/>\ntake to heal and med and poke their heads into the zone and say &quot;is it <br/>\nclear now?&quot; for you and your group to really hammer the spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rhythms series are good here too... pulling a caster is really <br/>\ndistressing, so every resist counts. It&#39;s not always feasible to attack it <br/>\nwhere it stands, unfortunately, so if you do encounter one always have this <br/>\nsong ready cuz these guys can knock you down 400 hp in a flash (well, a few <br/>\nflashes, actually ;) One trick is to round as many corners as possible <br/>\nbetween you and them... keep them moving to get that LOS until your people <br/>\ncan move in on it. They&#39;ve not got many hp so a wiz or 2 can make short <br/>\nwork of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackstabs are another nasty-nasty. It&#39;s not uncommon to be hit for 140 <br/>\nshould you get engulfed in some badness. Espcially if you&#39;ll lullabying <br/>\neverything around you. I think they actually move around to try and BS you <br/>\nwhile you beat on your target... kinda vicious if that&#39;s so. I like it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe loot is pretty good too. It&#39;s not uncommon to loot a2 or 3 pp&#39;s off <br/>\nsome of the minor critters. You&#39;ll also get rawhide, vamp blood, gargoyle <br/>\neyes...not amazing, but decent enough. I just wish there were some magical <br/>\nstuffs on them. Apart from the shield I don&#39;t know of anything special you <br/>\ncan get there until you take on Gypsy&#39;s and such... a little disappointing. <br/>\nEven the gnolls in BB drop fairly decent magical items.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can sell to the (uncannily silent) elf merchants in lesser Faydark. <br/>\nFinally, it&#39;s a great place to get to know people and just be a Bard... oh <br/>\nthe angry shouts and /tells I&#39;ve gotten when I&#39;ve composed a little rhyming <br/>\nyell to the people who constantly drag trains! The laughs I&#39;ve received as <br/>\nI sing out the flaws of the various guilds who come in there regularly to <br/>\n&quot;clear this place out!&quot; and end up dying horribly. The praise I&#39;ve gotten <br/>\nwhen I&#39;ve let people know of someone&#39;s good actions... it&#39;s all good ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a couple of beefs I have:<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Lament will NOT work, yet the mob won&#39;t attack me when it <br/>\nresists. Anyone know why?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Lullaby WILL work, yet I&#39;ll still be hit by the mob that was <br/>\nsupposedly nodding its head - when no one else has hit it. I know this may <br/>\nbe as a result of a DOT spell cast on it... but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve been <br/>\nsoloing and have been attacked by something that just nodded its head, with <br/>\nno one else around. Anyone experienced this? If it fails I&#39;m cool with <br/>\nthat, but if it succeeds it *should* work... no?<br/>\n<br/>\nDang, another long message from me. I hope people actually read this far :/ <br/>\nI&#39;d like to know the answer(s) to these last beefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
