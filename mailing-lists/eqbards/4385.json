Yes.  I ve actually reached HtoH(10) at my current level 11 ... still trying to find a good group to improve it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-176336564\">From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Have you ever tried hand to hand combat?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  I&#39;ve actually reached HtoH(10) at my current level 11 ... still<br/>\ntrying to find a good group to improve it with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Go into a newbie zone and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;pick a fight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;because of your ac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you.  But you will be punching them for 1 point of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah.  Unfortunately, that won&#39;t improve my HtoH skill since the<br/>\nmonsters are trivial.  Of course, my mandolin&#39;d Dissonance is already<br/>\nmaking them run as fast as they can away from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Now you should be getting into groups where they are attacking<br/>\n&gt;&gt;monsters that are so much higher than you that your normal weps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in that case will be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves and hand<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to hand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a Dirk or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Combine are not gonna do any good.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  But as long as I&#39;m just doing 100% songs, I might as well turn<br/>\non<br/>\nautoattack and get my skill up.  I&#39;ll still get 1 or 2 punches in.  I<br/>\nactually do this to black (even) and yellow (higher) monsters so I<br/>\ncan<br/>\nactually hit and gain skill quickly.  Reds are slow to skill up on,<br/>\nand<br/>\ninvulnerable is (of course) impossible to get skill-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Even lower level monsters that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;your regular weps can hit will be hitting you and your party<br/>\n&gt;&gt;pretty hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes ... I&#39;ve mentioned that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If you are in the melee, you will be at risk of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;getting stunned and not having your songs be used all of the time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;And you will get beat up for no gain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, since you&#39;re not the main source of damage -- and I guess I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t reached that mob frenzy level with these monsters yet -- the<br/>\nmob<br/>\npretty much ignores you.  Whenever I the party beset by multiple<br/>\nblack<br/>\nmobs, I switch from weapon to mandolin and swap between Anthem, Hymn,<br/>\nand Dissonance ... and I do my HtoH.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that donning heavy armor (read: Banded and up) when you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t maxed out the defensive skills (Defense, Dodge) makes you a<br/>\ntarget for bashs and stuns.  The only time I wear armor is when I<br/>\npick<br/>\nthem up from frogloks in Innothule.  Otherwise, I look like a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;p.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and monster<br/>\n&gt;&gt;combos where I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;done the h2h combat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try it out!  Get a three or four player party and gang up on blacks.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll get good exp and HtoH skill raises.  I think I&#39;ve heard that<br/>\nBard HtoH skills are worthless compared to tanks, but if a magic user<br/>\nis<br/>\nhitting the mob with a dagger, I better be in there with my fists!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh ... I only do this when I know the tanks can take the mob out.  I<br/>\ngroup with a lot of paladins and monks.  They have a big ego about<br/>\nhow they can slay monsters before anyone else -- I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nburst that bubble yet when I equip my fastest weapons (soon to buy a<br/>\ndirk) and do Whistle and Anthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input everyone!  I&#39;ll just sell my netted gloves to my<br/>\nmonk friends!  I wonder if this a Verant &quot;bug&quot;  or a Verant<br/>\n&quot;balancing&quot; quirk.<br/>\n<br/>\noh well.... back to powerleveling for magical attacks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
