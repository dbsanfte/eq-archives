So you can play around<br/>\nwith healing and pulling to settle on a rate where the action<br/>\nis pretty much non-stop without having to ask &quot;mana?&quot; all the<br/>\ntime.  (Casters can join in on the nonstop fun too if they&#39;re<br/>\ngood about conserving their mana. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, playing Hymn with a lute instead of using weapons<br/>\nmeant each fight was taking a little bit longer.  But if you<br/>\nwere waiting to heal up after each fight anyway, then your<br/>\nkill rate would be better if you can keep everyone almost<br/>\ntopped (since waiting to heal time = not-doing-any-damage<br/>\ntime).<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people complain about excessive downtime in this<br/>\ngame.  The one thing no other class can touch a bard at is<br/>\nreducing or eliminating downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
