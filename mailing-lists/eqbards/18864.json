Because the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enchanter<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can get mobbed just as badly, and has way less AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s still at the crux of my argument.  Enchanters get mobbed when they<br/>\nintentionally attempt to affect all of the extra mobs AND they get resisted<br/>\nby some/all of them.  Bards get hit between rounds when charming, and they<br/>\nget hit until Pixie Strike decides to make it through both resistance checks<br/>\nwhen trying to &quot;enthrall.&quot;  When using Pixie, they have a 3 second recast<br/>\ntime, and I generally have to Pixie more than once to stick it -- meaning<br/>\nI&#39;m taking a beating.  Enchanters have the fast-casting Stun line to help<br/>\nagainst those that resist the AE Mez (unless multiples resist, in which case<br/>\ncasting even a fast spell is often times futile).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Enchanters and Bards BOTH have tools to mitigate the need for AC. Frankly,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not asking that Enchanters be given more AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t trying to imply that you thought Enchanters needed more AC<br/>\n(although, I&#39;d be all for them getting more... I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the<br/>\nguts to do what I do as a bard without all that plate on me).  I was trying<br/>\nto show that a bard takes a lot more damage due to (a) song &quot;casting&quot; time,<br/>\n(b) game mechanics involved with buffing/regen songs and extra mobs, and (c)<br/>\nresist rates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To begin with, at least up to my level, we get enough Rune to absorb ONE<br/>\n&gt; blow from<br/>\n&gt; an enemy (perhaps two. Depending on its level relative to you) And if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; trying to cast mez, you&#39;re certainly not going to waste time Rune&#39;ing<br/>\n&gt; yourself<br/>\n&gt; first.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am used to seeing the enchanter cast Rune before combat; it gives them the<br/>\nability to cast a crowd control spell after a resisting mob turns to them.<br/>\nRemember, unlike a bard who gets mobbed for just doing his normal thing, an<br/>\nenchanter won&#39;t get mobbed until they intentionally provoke the crowd with<br/>\nan AE Mez.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Secondly, Rune doesn&#39;t stop stunning.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our songs are stopped by stuns, just as enchanters are.  I was referring to<br/>\nnormal hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And doens&#39;t allow you to cast while<br/>\n&gt; being hit (People keep saying &quot;Cast this on the cleric so they cast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>through while<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; being mobbed. It doesn&#39;t work that way.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, when being mobbed, you&#39;re pretty much screwed.  The Rune would be<br/>\nbroken through before any spell could possibly be cast.  The bigger problem<br/>\nthough, is that at least one mob in that crowd is likely to stun you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At my level, rangers don&#39;t have SoW, Shamans can be hard to find, and I<br/>\n &gt; really do get into groups without druids sometime. And bard song is a LOT<br/>\n </span></blockquote>faster than SoW to begin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with. Even at lower levels you can tell this difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use the term &quot;at my level&quot; because I&#39;m taking into consideration the level<br/>\nof the dungeon from which the Singing Steel armor comes from.<br/>\nSelo&#39;s is faster than SoW, yes.  But, SoW still allows you to outrun most<br/>\nmobs.  If I&#39;m getting torn into by a group of mobs, I can&#39;t rely on being<br/>\nable to start up Selo&#39;s.<br/>\nAs you said, the running speed only really matters if the party is fleeing,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
