Why play the<br/>\n&quot;another class&quot; when you can play this class and have a pet<br/>\nthat&#39;s better than that &quot;another class&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you don&#39;t believe the classes should be balanced (which<br/>\nis a valid viewpoint, but yet another reason I don&#39;t like<br/>\nclass-based systems).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; verant ever once state that? Again you can do other things to make up for<br/>\n&gt; melee so it&#39;s not unbalancing can my pet mes? charm? mana song ? heal song?<br/>\n&gt; Or hell can it even think? A pet in no case is a replacement for a real<br/>\n&gt; thinking tank not once have I ever seen somebody go no we don&#39;t want you for<br/>\n&gt; our group we got a necro pet or a magician pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;d have a point if the necro class were just the pet.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not - it&#39;s the necro and the pet.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>\ncharm, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t regen mana, but you can.  <br/>\nNo the pet can&#39;t nuke/DoT/buff, but you can.  No the pet can&#39;t<br/>\nthink, but you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, if the idea of casting classees having pets that<br/>\ncan melee better than or almost as well as melee classes makes<br/>\nsense, then so does the idea of melee classes having pets that<br/>\ncan cast spells better than or almost as well as casting<br/>\nclasses.  /pet heal me, /pet nuke &lt;target&gt;, /pet evac us, /pet<br/>\nmes &lt;target&gt;, /pet buff &lt;target&gt;, and make them regen mana 5x<br/>\nfaster than players (which is approx how fast pets heal).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
