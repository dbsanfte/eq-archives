","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1945323670\">Not sure if you are responding to my original - or a subsequent..  But you<br/>\nare COMPLETELY wrong about GM&#39;s and Guides only helping due to a &quot;verifiable<br/>\nbug&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t complain that they didn&#39;t help me - but that they help everyone<br/>\nelse in that situation.  In the past 24 hours I&#39;ve grouped with three count<br/>\nem three people (counting my initial friend) who got their corpses moved by<br/>\nGM&#39;s because they couldn&#39;t target them.  They spent maybe 40-60 minutes at<br/>\ncorpse retrieval when I spent literally 5-6 hours.  I guess in hindsight I<br/>\ncould have lied and said I couldn&#39;t target the corpse and see if they knew<br/>\nenough about bards to tell me to sing the song.  These other people<br/>\ncertainly could have been forced to go to Freeport and buy a chipped bone<br/>\nstaff and done a corpse locate that way and targeted - but that didn&#39;t occur<br/>\nto the GM&#39;s either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the GM&#39;s spent any time even verifying these peoples<br/>\ncomplaints.  They just popped in and move the Corpse right next to the zone<br/>\nentrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to the point - my  problem wasn&#39;t getting to the corpse - but getting<br/>\nthe corpse out of lava.  I think it&#39;s a stupid level design.  Especially<br/>\ngiven that things have been so laggy lately it makes it quite easy to<br/>\nmisstep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;m complaining about...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Randy Keith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, December 05, 1999 4:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Randy Keith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that GM&#39;s and Guides<br/>\nmust help you if you cannot get<br/>\n&gt; your corpse?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it is stuck in a<br/>\nwall. Or fallen through the world.<br/>\n&gt; Or lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you<br/>\nmade friends)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke<br/>\nsaying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>\n&gt; this knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back<br/>\non.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse. I have<br/>\nhad guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>\n&gt; on the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot<br/>\nwhere&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>\n&gt; been retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own<br/>\ndoing. (Lag related or not).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist you when<br/>\nthe chips are down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava, don&#39;t go<br/>\ncrying about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>\n&gt; your aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug,<br/>\nthen by all means call a GM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
