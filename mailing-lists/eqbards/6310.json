You can go search for<br/>\nthe legends and have a reasonable expectation of finding them in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I like best the idea that certain items or NPCs can be looted only<br/>\nonce by a given character.  How about adding permanent hate with a<br/>\nvengence?  If you got or would have gotten XP for killing a particularly<br/>\nvaluable NPC, you&#39;re on the permanent hate list.   That means you have an<br/>\nextremely high probability of being killed by a super frenzy of that NPC or<br/>\nsome other NPC that shows up there only to exact such vengence.  So not<br/>\nonly could you not loot the same item, if you go back after the same NPC<br/>\nyou&#39;ll most likely die, even if you just poke it from a distance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
