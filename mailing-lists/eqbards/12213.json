Having guild members in the group can make a world of<br/>\ndifference.  And having high level guild members can make really hard CR<br/>\nmuch easier (wolf form is non-agro to most stuff in Unrest) and you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to worry about consenting a guild member to drag you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut guilded or not - I would not have left until everyone was CR&#39;d.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, December 28, 1999 2:36 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Question on EQ etiquette (OT and long)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a bad situation last night in the ghost room in Unrest.  Want to run it<br/>\nby everyone to get your opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[snips scene of ugly death]<br/>\n<br/>\nI was bound in GFAY.  Before I could finish memming my songs, the group<br/>\nleader (the shaman) said he had to leave so he could complete one of the<br/>\nshaman armor quests. <br/>\n<br/>\nWas wondering what the general consensus is with you guys on the shaman&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior.  In every group I have been in so far everyone stuck around until<br/>\neveryone got their corpse back, especially the group leader.  I was totally<br/>\nappalled by the shaman&#39;s behavior.  This was far and away the maddest I have<br/>\nbeen since I have been playing.  It was also the first time I have ever<br/>\ngotten into a /tell argument with someone over any issue.  Anyone who has<br/>\never grouped with me can tell you that I can get along with just about<br/>\nanybody.  This guy pushed me beyond my limits though.  Was I out of line for<br/>\nexpecting the group leader to stick around?    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
