This is pathetic","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1434701546\">gatorsmash maul sucks, as did 98% of all pre kunark 2h blunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gatorsmash is dam 30, delay 70, which is not even better than a .5<br/>\nratio. This is pathetic compared to the 2h slashes that were pre kunark<br/>\n(mith 2 hander is 21 / 40 + haste making it more like 21 / 30, there are<br/>\nseveral 35 / 50 weapons etc.) Pre kunark 1h blunts followed the same sort of<br/>\ndisadvantage where the 1h slash were FAR superior in ratio to the 1h blunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, pre kunark 2h weapons did not have the additional damage bonus<br/>\nwhich further skewed the bias to fast 1 hand weapons. Bards had pick of the<br/>\nlitter of both 1h slash and 1h blunt and could far outdamage druids or<br/>\nshamen of similar melee ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point:<br/>\nA bard dual wielding yaks will put a shaman using a gatorsmash to shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nPre kunark, bard defense skills were superior to shamen, clerics and druids<br/>\nso we had the advantage there also, albeit slight a slight one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that isn&#39;t to say that we were good at melee, but if you put 2 decent<br/>\nweapons into the hands of a bard, they can dish out some damage. If you put<br/>\na decent weapons into the hands of a druid, it&#39;s still useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a days, with the release of kunark, melee between druids, shamen,<br/>\nclerics and bards has evened out a bit because the weapon selection in the<br/>\nblunt arena is on par with the selection of slashers and piercers. This<br/>\nmeans that now, bards only have the slight advantage in melee skills that we<br/>\nhave to put us ahead of one of the healing classes in a straight melee<br/>\nfight. Thus, relatively, we have lost melee skill when compared with a<br/>\ndruid, cleric or shaman.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

Our Melee &quot;Skills&quot; have never been<br/>\nmuch better than pure casters.  And there were always some freakin brutal<br/>\nweapons available to casters that were 2h blunt (Gatorsmash maul comes to<br/>\nmind for shaman).  The weapon field was a TAD skewed in our favor but the<br/>\nbottom line was that our melee ability isn&#39;t much better than that of a<br/>\ncleric, shaman or druid.  All four of them get 4 offense/defense points per<br/>\nlevel (to our 5) have only slightly lower dodge caps (75 or 80) and can wear<br/>\nequivalent armor (Cleric armor is actully just as good, if not better).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, sure we were &quot;Better&quot; at melee.  But we were FAR from &quot;Good&quot; at melee.<br/>\nWe have always been a VERY poor substitute for any of the &quot;melee&quot; classes in<br/>\nthe game.  Early in final, as Kit has said, a lot of bards who hadn&#39;t been<br/>\nbeyond level 20 yet were adamant that bards were only slightly worse at<br/>\nmelee than other hybrids.  Which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards are the &quot;Caster&quot; hybrid.  The others are &quot;Melee&quot; hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywayz, Kit is right.  A lot more bards understand themselves better these<br/>\ndays ;)  It&#39;s actually nice to think back to some of the rather humorous<br/>\nassumptions that newbie bards used to start with ;)  Now days most newbie<br/>\nbards (the good ones anyway) get educated by the best (those on this list)<br/>\nearly on and learn how to be very effective bards indeed.  I would say that<br/>\noverall the quality of bards has improved because of the bards on this list<br/>\nand, to a slightly lesser extent, the bards on the Concert Hall.  Rokken&#39;s<br/>\nsite, Caster&#39;s Realm and Concert Hall have all become excellent resources<br/>\nfor bards.  When I started barding we didn&#39;t have anything but word of mouth<br/>\n(usually in the chat area when servers were down).<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nLevelling since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our melee skills pre kunark were much better than druids or shamen based<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our selection of weapons. post kunark, with the discovery of some brutal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>2h<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; blunt items, the scales are more balanced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nOld school buds here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/13/_/451022/_/962913548/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/13/_/451022/_/962913548/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
