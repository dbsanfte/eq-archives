Commonland - Foraged item: Sundergrass, made into: Sundergrass<br/>\nSoup or <br/>\n         something..<br/>\n\t  -Oasis - Dune Berries - Brewed into: Dune Ale<br/>\n4) Bind/Group Bind required one reagent per group member, if not all<br/>\nreagents are <br/>\n   present, bind fails (Group bind would need 6 for all six), or make it a<br/>\nrandom<br/>\n   bind, 4 reagent = random 4 people get bound, similar to succor spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Bind/Group Bind Costs the equivalent of Dying once at your current level.<br/>\nThis <br/>\n   affects all personnel getting bound.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Bind/Group Bind can only be sung once every 1-X days (TBD) similar to Lay<br/>\nof Hands<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in the middle of the hybrid magic tree in my opinion:<br/>\n<br/>\nTop:<br/>\nDruid<br/>\nShaman<br/>\nBard<br/>\nRanger<br/>\nPaladin<br/>\nShadow Knight<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about this really makes me wonder, if were not as Hybrid enough of<br/>\na hybrid to get bind like the Druid and Shaman, why do our songs fall under<br/>\nTrue Casting/Arcane arts rules? Selo for one under this thinking should work<br/>\nfine inside.  Its like saying, a solar powered radio (druid/Shaman in this<br/>\nanalogy) will stop working when taken into a dark dungeon (hence, no light,<br/>\nno power = hence, no force of nature - no power).  But take a Bard, singing<br/>\n(equivalent to a battery powered radio), take him inside, and the analogy<br/>\nfalls apart.  The bard is relying on his own power (batteries/singing), not<br/>\ndictated by loss of influence from a god, yet we cant work.  We know that if<br/>\nyou take away the light for the druid (nature), it wont work indoors, but<br/>\nfor the bard he takes his power with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm rambling, apparantly noone wants to hear this tripe anyway so Ill just<br/>\nshut up.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
