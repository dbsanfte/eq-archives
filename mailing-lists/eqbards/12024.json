We&#39;re comparable in stats,<br/>\nsame level, use similar tactics, and have comparable weapons and armour. I<br/>\ncan feel your pain when it comes to bard hate...one of my roleplaying /say<br/>\nmacros for use in such unpleasant combat situations is a droll &quot;Oh, sure,<br/>\npick on the Bard.&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution to the problem was a simple shift of location. Instead of<br/>\nUnrest, where a pull of three mobs is common, try areas where single mobs<br/>\ncan be pulled relatively easily. I&#39;ve become a big fan of South Karana<br/>\nrecently. Aviaks are good hunting, and a good low-twenties group can handle<br/>\ngnolls from the entrance to Paw. Get a bind in Arena so you&#39;re never far<br/>\nfrom your corpse, and don&#39;t be afraid to equip the drum, hit Selo&#39;s, and do<br/>\nwhat bards do best: Run Away Very Fast...there&#39;s plenty of room to run in<br/>\nSK.<br/>\n<br/>\n[21 Bard] Mannerism Dirgesinger (Half-Elf) &lt;Intrepid Spirit&gt; SERVER: The<br/>\nRathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
