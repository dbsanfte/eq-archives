Not a very big<br/>\naffected, but it would be nice if you&#39;re trying to flee.<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie strike is one of the cooler songs we get, and I&#39;ve always envisioned<br/>\nit (from the mob&#39;s perspective) that they were literally chasing pixies.<br/>\nThis could be quite humerous and clever if done right in a pvp sense:  have<br/>\nthe PC lose you as their current target, to be replaced by this pixie which<br/>\nthey indeed chase (turn in a random direction and swing at).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you&#39;ve noticed, I&#39;ve included losing you as their current target as a big<br/>\npart and you might be wondering why (and if you understand why you might<br/>\nthink its too powerful, but let me finish).  If you&#39;re not the target then<br/>\nthey can&#39;t attack you.  This might be considered too powerful except for the<br/>\nfact F7 (default) targets the closest PC (generally that would be YOU) AND<br/>\nthe minute you attempt to do damage to the character, you are auto targeted,<br/>\nhence these songs would facilitate fleeing and maybe a sneak attack/ambush<br/>\nif you&#39;re in cahoots with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?  Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh a semi-unrelated note: I&#39;ve recently moved to very quick, light damage<br/>\nweapons when I melee - combine dual wield with warsong or anthem you are<br/>\nliterally the tazmanian devil of meleeers.  I got to thinking however, how<br/>\ndoes dual wield really work?  Someone speculated that its keyed off your<br/>\nprimary hand (every swing = chance for dual wield to go off as well).  This<br/>\nwould suggest getting something like a dirk in the primary and then a heavy<br/>\nhitter/proc&#39;ing weapon in the offhand, since you could cheat the system in<br/>\naffect if your heavy hitter had a chance to hit quicker than its normal<br/>\ndelay.  I haven&#39;t experimented, but can anyone elaborate on dual wield<br/>\nstragies?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Scummy & Sicarius @ Veeshan&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
