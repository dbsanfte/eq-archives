I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2080276130\">Yes, I know John, we play on the same server and met back in the low 20s<br/>\nin Unrest. He is one of the best bards on the server hands down in my<br/>\nopinion. I always love his tests because they are thorough and<br/>\ninformative. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCould Verant have secretly sneaked in a fix to Lullaby on us? I have<br/>\nread Lullaby, like Charm, is CHA intensive for resist checks. Last night<br/>\nwe did it again, fighting L19-20 aviak guards at the &quot;Fire Tower&quot; in<br/>\nLake Rathetear. A L17 Cleric, L18 Bard, and L20 Shaman. All three guards<br/>\nwere spawned and we had to split them, 2 L19&#39;s and a L20. The L20<br/>\nappeared to resist it heavily, the 2 L19s snored through the entire<br/>\nfight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else might make the difference? Songs check Dex too, based on a<br/>\nmessage I read a bit ago (I cannot confirm the source or orginal poster<br/>\nunfortunately). I&#39;m not sure why we have been so lucky with Lullaby. As<br/>\nI said previously, I&#39;ve also used it with &#39;stunning&#39; success on my own<br/>\nbard, those NPC clerics I could never hope to kill now can never get a<br/>\nheal or wrath off, and after they hit 50% it&#39;s all over since they are<br/>\nchained and feared. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else been able to get Lullaby to work effectively enough to keep<br/>\nit memm&#39;d? Are people twisting it, manually pulsing it, or letting it<br/>\nplay on it on? When I use it to interrupt casters, it has been manually<br/>\npulsing it, twisting will not keep the targets asleep without an<br/>\ninstrument from what I&#39;ve seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thudnerwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
