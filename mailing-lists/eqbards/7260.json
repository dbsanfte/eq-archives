Aside from our Skill bonus in melee (the aforementioned<br/>\n5xLVL +5) and our significantly higher dodge cap.  The difference could be in<br/>\nthe stats of your character vs. mine, but the stats themselves are not nearly<br/>\nas much of a determinant as the classes themselves. (a gnome warrior is STILL a<br/>\nwarrior...etc)  But, my base str is 93, and in melee mode it is 103, with no<br/>\nbuffs or songs playing.  at lvl 20, i have offense/defense/1HS/Piercing/Dual<br/>\nWield/Hand to Hand all maxed out.  I Have no problems outperforming a shaman or<br/>\ndruid of equal level in melee...it is not even close. (except for HP, i am as<br/>\ngood as a ranger)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You kited beetles 6 levels higher than you using bellow?  I hate to be rude<br/>\n&gt;but I do not believe you.  Not only would it take forever at the 7 pts a<br/>\n&gt;bellow you would have been doing, but the resists would have been frequent.<br/>\n&gt;Past that they should have been not &#39;too frequent&#39; but nearly 100%!  Not to<br/>\n&gt;mention that running into anything else would have made 1 or 2 stuns fatal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1.  there is a &gt;6 lvl cap on bellow...yes, 100% resist.<br/>\n2.  the thing that you need to understand about the Beetles is that they have<br/>\nlike NO base Magic Resist.  they cannot resist anything (ask a Wiz). Another<br/>\nthing is that they have a delay on their attacks of roughly 4 seconds.  They<br/>\ncannot stun you long enough to take advantage of it.  You don&#39;t run into<br/>\nanything else, because there are about 100 safe spots to kite in North Karana. <br/>\nI ran into 1 griffawn in 8 levels...and zoned.  <br/>\n3.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is that the beetles Run (their MAX speed) is<br/>\nSLOWER than you running WITHOUT accelerando.  WITHOUT PLAYING ANY SONGS, YOU<br/>\nCAN STILL OUTRUN THEM.<br/>\n4.  they really don&#39;t hit very hard when they do.  they have a good ac,<br/>\nmarginal to poor HPs and a poor attack skill (for their level) and they are the<br/>\nslowest mob in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is actually very difficult to die fighting the beetles.<br/>\nI was not using Entirely bellow, because it could be quite lengthy on a high<br/>\nred, i was using Bellow and COD.  That way i could pull Multiples and save<br/>\nmyself time by kiting them more than one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi, to ease your mind...the ones that i kited that were right below the<br/>\nHard Resist cap:  13 minutes to kite. (not very efficient:( ) Pull yellows if<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid (Still no last name)<br/>\n20th song (and only 2 deaths since 8th level...both linkdead deaths)<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\nWave of the Dark Tide <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
