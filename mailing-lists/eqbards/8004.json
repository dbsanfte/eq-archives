Give me some melee reds any<br/>\nday!<br/>\n<br/>\nDivide and conquer - kill the 2 that sit at the base of hill.  Watch for the<br/>\nones that patrol and take them out.  Try to set up so that you can divide<br/>\nthe camp and attack the edges . Lull the lowest ones first and try to pull<br/>\nthe one likely to resist your lulls.   Try to pull so that they don&#39;t come<br/>\nthrough other mobs agro ranges.  Like they said - casters tend to not pull<br/>\nbut sit back and cast - hit something that will melee and pull it a long way<br/>\nout to make the caster run or stay out of the fight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe plan: &quot;ok everyone charge!&quot; does not work - been there - done that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest going to the other camp - the one near the river on the far east<br/>\nand south side of the zone - just before the ghouls.  Lots less extra stuff<br/>\nto deal with.  There are 2 that spawn closer to the river and do short<br/>\npatrols. - Kill them first. Then you can approach the camp and look for a<br/>\ngood angle to attack so you can pull melee mobs out of the caster ranges.<br/>\nYou could try for a pull and have your party ready to bounce the casters<br/>\nfirst as they chase you.  Like they said - drag the mobs around and have<br/>\nyour team pick them off one by one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJamie Furtner [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfurtner@...\">jfurtner@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, October 05, 1999 5:32 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Bardic deaths<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Jamie Furtner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfurtner@...\">jfurtner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI recently played with a party of six in West Karana, and we<br/>\ntried<br/>\n\t\tto kill some bandits in the bandit camp.
