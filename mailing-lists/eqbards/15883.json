I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1872170150\">Hehe, do enough dragons and eventually everyone gets everything they want.<br/>\nWe use a point system similar to Shada&#39;s, and I only recently obtained my<br/>\nbelt.  I think there&#39;s only one or two other people that are waiting for a<br/>\nbelt still.  A lot of people chose to hold out for the CoF/TBB combo too, so<br/>\nthere&#39;s actually relatively few people who wanted the belt.<br/>\nI&#39;ve also got the Selo&#39;s Drum and the Horn of War (which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve<br/>\neven used) since we only have two bards in our guild, and the other one<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t show up nearly as much.  We&#39;ve sorta reached a point now, where the<br/>\nonly dragon items people still need/want are the haste items.  I&#39;ve also got<br/>\nan orb of tishan (awesome bard item btw) and a gold plated koshigitana<br/>\n(pretty crappy, very low proc rate and next to no summoned mobs to use it<br/>\nagainst)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my gloves clash horribly, but I haven&#39;t been able to obtain imbrued<br/>\nones yet.  None have even dropped on our server to date.  Was sorta thinking<br/>\nof going for the gauntlets of fiery might anyway.  They&#39;re not in very high<br/>\ndemand since most classes have better planar gloves, and our monks all<br/>\nalready have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got the tranix crown, but tend to only wear it for situational uses<br/>\n(i.e. I need the extra MR or CHA)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy base DEX is 100 if that helps at all.  I was actually at 150 before I<br/>\nswapped out my GBP choker for the mithril torque.  Wasn&#39;t even aiming for<br/>\ndex really, it just sorta worked out that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooded black cloak, crested spaulders and runed lava pendant are currently<br/>\non my want list.  Was considering diamondines, but they&#39;re hella hard to<br/>\ncome by it seems (too lazy to camp them myself) and if I did get any, I&#39;d<br/>\nprobably give them to my monk first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been very fortunate in my equipment, in that 90% of the time I&#39;m the<br/>\nonly bard around.  I&#39;ve never really had to worry about loot squabbles, I<br/>\ntend to get items mainly because nobody else is there to claim them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: M Sanford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 08, 2000 6:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Imbrued gloves?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: M Sanford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow on earth did they let a bard have a runed bolster belt? =)<br/>\nSeriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>\nloot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>\nit make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>\nA few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>\nyou&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>\nWear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>\nawful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>\nImbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>\nCrested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>\nproc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>\nhp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>\nDiamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>\nthe opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>\nbracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>\nhow much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>\nPlease let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
