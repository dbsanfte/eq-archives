MANY times this has happened lately and what<br/>\nis actually is is a TIME warp.  It happens when you DIE RIGHT AS YOU ZONE.<br/>\nIt for some reason takes you back a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral Dwarven characters were banned for DUPING items and money that way.<br/>\nThey would hand over all their cash and item then duel a friend to almost<br/>\ndeath and then kill them as they zoned and they would pop back in time a few<br/>\nminutes and have all their stuff back. The person they handed their stuff to<br/>\nALSO had their stuf THUS having 2 over everything they handed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a hater of bug exploiters and glad they got caught and banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my guess thats its the same thing that happened to you..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar 20th level woodelf bard<br/>\nNuldar 39th level necromancer<br/>\nTarrew Marr server<br/>\n&quot;Wardancer, Gates of Solaris&quot;<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 01, 1999 1:44 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Interesting bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Earlier tongiht I was hunting with a druid friend in Permafrost.
