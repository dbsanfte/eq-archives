Thus, we can equip the item and from the outside views<br/>\nit looks like you are holding a bow.  Ammo is another story.  Somewhere<br/>\nthere is said to be &quot;all /all&quot; arrows.  Normal arrows are coded for only the<br/>\nclasses that normally have bows and bards cant load them into the ammo slot.<br/>\nBut on some uncommon or rare drops - people have mentioned &quot;all / all&quot;<br/>\narrows.  Again, probably some mistake or oversight in loading the database.<br/>\nAnyhow, I am looking for them.  Without the skill, I wonder if we will even<br/>\nbe able to fire the weapon (I am thinking no but we shall see) let alone be<br/>\nable to hit anything.  Worse than the level 1 caps in 2hb and 2hs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT: Sylly Songsynger you have been banned for one week for<br/>\nexploiting and using a bow and arrow!  Take this time and think about what<br/>\nyou have done!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, gone for 3 months?  Well, Verant has stepped up the enforcement of the<br/>\n&#39;rules&#39; (play nice, exploiting, and consent theft, etc.) And there have<br/>\nbeen - server wide announcements in the prime time hours of player<br/>\nbanishment, etc.  Take a look around West Freeport, we might find some<br/>\nstocks and pillaries next - heh.  It would be kinda funny if they summoned<br/>\nyou somewhere public and locked your &quot;toon&quot; (ok, avatar) into a stocks.<br/>\nForcing you to spend some amount of online time on public display for your<br/>\nso-called crimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 08, 2000 2:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bow for bards!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; OK I&#39;m just got Kunark after taking a 3 month break from EQ.
