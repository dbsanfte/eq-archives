There&#39;s times when it&#39;s useful, but for the<br/>\nmost part, you&#39;re better off taking advantage of the fact that you hit well,<br/>\nand hard, with 1h weapons, and can dual wield.  If you wish to play a nearly<br/>\npassive support bard,  I wish you luck.  While your songs are a great aid to<br/>\nthe party, most would prefer you loan your blade skills as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, there&#39;s no increased or decreased spell effects using different<br/>\ninstruments of the same class.  Was something Geoffrey wanted to implement,<br/>\nbut never got around to doing.  So use a lute to save a few gold, if you<br/>\nwish, it&#39;s functionally the same as a mandolin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Dantos &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ascuro@...\">ascuro@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 4:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bardic Skill Caps<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Dantos &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ascuro@...\">ascuro@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greetings all.  I was wondering if anyone knew about our skill caps?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Specifically, Hand to Hand - for a while now, mine has stopped at 3 * level<br/>\n&gt;+ 1.  Does anyone know if this is the limit for us in this skill?  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;asked several of our bardic kin in-game, and no one seems to know the<br/>\n&gt;answer for sure (I got a lot of people curious though  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, and one more thing - does anyone know if there are any specific<br/>\n&gt;differences in using the various instruments avaliable in the game?  (for<br/>\n&gt;example - the mandolin and the lute - is it just the weight that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;different?  or a brass horn and a mino horn?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dantos, bard of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
