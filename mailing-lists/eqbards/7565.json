I will<br/>\njust<br/>\nthrow in my views on the most debated subjects...<br/>\n<br/>\nI  think the melee/hybrid/caster thread needs to be kaboinged.. now.<br/>\nAnd the bind thread should IMO go the same way, but first I would like to<br/>\nsupport and back Shada&#39;s point of view. I am a casual player who have been<br/>\nplaying since day one of p4 beta I also only play a few hours a day and is<br/>\nnowhere near Shada&#39;s levels (Never played a char that could bind). I have<br/>\nalso<br/>\nbeen playing my bard since April or so. That said I still agree with Shada<br/>\nthat<br/>\nbinding should be keept the way it is or even changed so that casters are<br/>\nlimited to binding themselves in cities too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning back to your corpse is a penalty for dying just as the exp loss is.<br/>\nThe<br/>\nexp loss is not a very harsh penalty unless you die several times in a row.<br/>\nSo<br/>\nIMO the only real penalty is the hazzle of running back to your corpse.<br/>\nIf there wasent a penalty like this the game would turn into something very<br/>\nboring. I for one cant figure out any penalty that I would &quot;like&quot; better<br/>\nthan<br/>\nrunning back? Bigger exp loss? Loss of equipment? stat penalties?<br/>\nI like it the way it is, EQ is not an easy game thats why it still dont bore<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hazzle is not even that bad with the bard because of the running speed<br/>\nIMO.<br/>\nwhere as with my shadowknight its more tedius because of his slow running<br/>\nspeed<br/>\nand the fact that guards and merchants dont like him much, and even then if<br/>\nits<br/>\nreally far away I can useually find a friendly person to cast sow on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to bards being able to bind?? No I really dont like that idea. With<br/>\nselo&#39;s we<br/>\nare pretty well off for travelling and giving bards bind will seriusly<br/>\noverpower<br/>\nunless it was made useless by giving it penalties.<br/>\nI really dont understand people who have troubles finding anyone to bind<br/>\n(exept<br/>\nin Erud offcourse), and I even play from europe which means that most of my<br/>\ntime<br/>\nonline there is &lt; 1000 players online (bertox server).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell these are my views - Feel free to disagree ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards and KABOING TO ME<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum level 21 woodelf bard<br/>\nBagkal level 10 Troll Shadowknight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1999 13:55:36 -1000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\nShada: what you say in your last sentence sums up the whole issue.  For me<br/>\nat least, the time spent travelling back to your corpse from multiple zones<br/>\naway is not fun and completely boring.  That time could be better spent<br/>\nadventuring, which is the fun part of EQ to me.  Lets say on average it<br/>\ntakes you 15 minutes to get back to your corpse.  If you could get bound in<br/>\nnon-cities, the amount of EXP you could gain during those 15 minutes is<br/>\nnowhere near the amount you lost when you died.  However, you get to spend<br/>\nthat 15 minutes playing the game in whatever manner makes it fun for you.<br/>\nIMO, the binding issue isn&#39;t a class balance issue but a &quot;Is this really<br/>\nwhat I want to be spending my valuable game time doing&quot; issue.  Don&#39;t take<br/>\nany offense, but based on the fact that you have a 50th level character and<br/>\ntwo 20+ level characters, you obviously have more time to devote to playing<br/>\nEQ than I do.  My only character is my 23d level bard and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>\nhim since April.  That gives you a pretty good idea how much time I get to<br/>\nplay.  As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get to play EQ<br/>\nthat much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major impact.  When I<br/>\ndie, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming session for me.<br/>\nThats why I support a change to the policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:   Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sent:   Thursday, September 30, 1999 1:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:     &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:     RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>\n&gt; classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>\n&gt; easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>\n&gt; die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>\n&gt; what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>\n&gt; fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not<br/>\n&gt; having<br/>\n&gt; fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - that there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advancement and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;end&#39;.
