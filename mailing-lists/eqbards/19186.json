The RP community there had a lot of good folks in it.<br/>\nOne of it&#39;s stars was a Troll Bard, well, she was quite sure she was a bard,<br/>\ndespite that her songs had different effects than the meat pie bards, to<br/>\nwit, mostly they worked like Anglich&#39;s Appalling Screech.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat follows is some historical information on the time that I just dug up<br/>\nwhile looking through old files.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the pen of Tsengu, Cleric of Innorruk, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Grobbe as an ambassador of Dark Unity and, as a side effort, to<br/>\nintroduce the Trolls to more refined culture, that is, Teir&#39;Dal culture.<br/>\nBoth efforts met with great success, and as part of the second effort I<br/>\nspent some time teaching our Troll brethren and sistren the finer arts.<br/>\nDespite that it is considered the most refined of the Teir&#39;Dal poetry forms,<br/>\nit was the haiku that was greeted most enthusiastically. What follows are<br/>\npoems I wrote on my missionary travels, please consider the audience for<br/>\nwhich they were intended and that their purpose was to entice our Dark<br/>\nAllies from the immediacy of their cultural interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quick note, Daowin was a Human Paladin of some renown, bringing great<br/>\nhavoc to The Nektulos and The Innothule when he was only of third rank.He<br/>\nwas highly respected and feared as well as, of course, hated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInnothule Haiku<br/>\n<br/>\nDaowin he yap<br/>\nHe yap while he in da swamp<br/>\nyou jus bash him gud<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin talk loud<br/>\nHe try to save da frogloc<br/>\nHe make nice meat pie<br/>\n<br/>\nHint to the Shaman<br/>\nBlindness found in Neriak<br/>\nThird Gate, need Elf help<br/>\n<br/>\nOozing, gooky mud<br/>\nAs far as the eye can see<br/>\nWho needs the patchwork?<br/>\n<br/>\nFroglok meat is nice<br/>\nworks good as accessory<br/>\nFlies bite it not you<br/>\n<br/>\nSkellie he go ha<br/>\nhe go ha ha ha ha ha<br/>\ndeez chips hurt my gums<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I returned home I continued to write, however, unfortunate events cut<br/>\nmy efforts short. They are included here for reference and some solace to<br/>\nthe pain any Teir&#39;Dal has suffered reading the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite hair, Satin skin<br/>\nResting on the newbie log<br/>\nNektulos&#39; promise<br/>\n<br/>\nFeirce Teir&#39;Dal fighter<br/>\nHe hates the Young Kodiak<br/>\nHe runs anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
