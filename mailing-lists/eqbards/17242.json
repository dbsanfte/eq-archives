Lots of room for AE, little danger of picking up greens that pose<br/>\nany problem. Reasonable loot, good experience. I hunted between the Eldrich<br/>\nCollective camp and the AquaGoblin camp and only twice had to bail into<br/>\nUnrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTentacle Terrors, Najena:<br/>\nTotal blast. Back to the wall, all instrument attack. You MUST chain them<br/>\nbefore they flee, there is a real danger with AE of a greenie pile-on. I got<br/>\ninto one down in the prison however Screech got me out again *grin* I zoned<br/>\ninto Lava and a crowd of teens so I said &quot;Do NOT go in there!&quot;,  I felt like<br/>\nJim Carey.... :o) Poor loot (finally got one tentacle whip however) great<br/>\nexp, ickiest sound effects in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nCentaurs, South Karana:<br/>\n*YAWN!* They hit very hard, but when it comes down to it you can just run<br/>\nand heal. Maybe I have a low tolerance for it because I tried to solo level<br/>\nin South Karana (meaning I ran around bored for hours) 2 levels ago but I<br/>\nfind this the most tedious soling in the game. Okay exp, average to low<br/>\nloot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCyclopes, Giant Skellies,  Rathe Mountains:<br/>\nKidding :o) Those were with a group, big fun though. Went to go fight the<br/>\nGnome Nerco (official new spelling) and played Guardian/Purifying Rhythms on<br/>\nmy new Mistmoor drum...gotta love that resist...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, a brief note, I was selling muffins in Lower Guk (I guess it must<br/>\nbe different on different servers, banking services and food were in pretty<br/>\nsmall demand) and a fellow *gave* me a serpentine bracer. Well, not 20<br/>\nminutes later I was running through Southern Ro and auctioning it (needing<br/>\nmoney for gems for Lambent) and a  Troll offers to trade me a Mistmoore<br/>\nBattle Drum for it...As the going price for SBracers is 250-300pp and MM<br/>\nDrums go for about 500-600pp took it. Yow, yow yow yow, I am worried I will<br/>\nuse up ALL my outrageous luck on items (Skull Shaped Barbute 235pp) and have<br/>\nnone left for hunting...I REALLY need to get ripped off in a trade soon to<br/>\nre-apportion my luck so it doesn&#39;t balance out in deaths. I am not sure of<br/>\nthe *exact* formula but I am pretty sure that is how luck works...<br/>\n<br/>\n*grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
