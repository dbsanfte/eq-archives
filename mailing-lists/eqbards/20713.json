It<br/>\nis a different environment altogether from what we<br/>\nconsider traditional RP environment.  That said, I<br/>\nfind that my characters develop a personality of their<br/>\nown after a time.  Terrok, my druid is kind of dour<br/>\nand a bit of a hardass.  As an officer in the guild,<br/>\nhe enforces some of the rules others fear to mention. <br/>\nHe is not well liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy shaman, Fenryr always &quot;throws a small sack of bones<br/>\non the ground and studies them carefully&quot; when asked<br/>\nfor a SOW.  The spirits may require a gift for his<br/>\nmagic to work -- it might be a bone chip, it might be<br/>\na bottle of kalish and it might be free...but the<br/>\nprice is the price and the spirits can&#39;t be denied;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes on the other hand is just a happy guy.  He<br/>\nsings to passers by and usually has something good to<br/>\nsay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my characters have a thing about beggars.  I think<br/>\nbegging takes away from the game.  Terrok and Fenryr<br/>\nnever give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>\nyoung bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>\nwon&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and Tyunes<br/>\nwill normally help out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Elijah Meeker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emeeker@...\">emeeker@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have pondered what I see as an anti-RP pressure in<br/>\n&gt; EQ a lot. I think it is<br/>\n&gt; because the game itself requires so much logistics<br/>\n&gt; discussion. Logistics can<br/>\n&gt; be diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data<br/>\n&gt; much less gussying it<br/>\n&gt; up, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends<br/>\n&gt; to sound pretty OOC.<br/>\n&gt; Guildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there<br/>\n&gt; is no premise at all of<br/>\n&gt; sharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location.<br/>\n&gt; How do you RP for more<br/>\n&gt; than a short span when one person is in the Field of<br/>\n&gt; bone as an Iksar and<br/>\n&gt; another in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the<br/>\n&gt; High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>\n&gt; player to quit playing a secondary and come help...<br/>\n&gt; Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; possible to counter the effect, just that it is hard<br/>\n&gt; work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tszaaz<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
