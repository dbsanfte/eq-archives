Could only play on weekends.<br/>\n&gt;Some recent highlights:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  Died 7 times in Plane of Hate.  My cleric never quite got just how<br/>\n&gt;few Hit Points I have.<br/>\n&gt;2.  Died 3 times to bad trains in Lower Guk.<br/>\n&gt;3.  Died once in Sebelis.  Five frog pull, four frogs decided that, of<br/>\n&gt;24 people there, I was the tastiest.  Never died so fast in my playing<br/>\n&gt;career.  The red just plummeted straight down to nothing, without<br/>\n&gt;stopping once.<br/>\n&gt;4.  Died three times in City of Mist, including once when I had managed<br/>\n&gt;to fall asleep.  Hey, sometimes people just take too darn long to get<br/>\n&gt;organized, you know?<br/>\n&gt;5.  Died to another bad train in Lower Guk.<br/>\n&gt;6.  Died in Skyfire, just a big pile of bad guys all at once.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmm.  16 deaths in one level.  How embarrassing is that?  Curiously, I<br/>\n&gt;never got negative experience for a day.  Thank goodness for level 49<br/>\n&gt;rezzes.  Just didn&#39;t get much positive experience.  Hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But!  (And yes, it&#39;s anti-climactic for many of you, but tough), I got<br/>\n&gt;level 50!  Giants in Burning Woods finally did the trick.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 50 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
