Head there and charm cyclopses<br/>\n&gt; to fight other clopses or giant skeletons. If you&#39;re really good with<br/>\n&gt; charm/selo&#39;s you can charm Tarskuk and have him wipe everything out for<br/>\n&gt; you. But he is faster than normal clops, so you might have to zone if you<br/>\n&gt; get into trouble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 10:33 AM 6/2/00 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hail<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         My bard is 28, and if I have to spend another day running around<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chickenville in SK looking for Harriers and Avocets during primetime I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going to go nuts.
