I do recognize the merits of<br/>\ndiscussing the optimal group composition (especially for bards, since we really<br/>\nare a meta class (our optimal functionality is improving the other group<br/>\nmembers)) but i have been in situations (and i am sure that we all have) where<br/>\nyou get the right *class* in your group, only to discover that the person is<br/>\neither ignorant, or agressively stupid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nExample of agressively stupid:  Grouped in Mistmoore...23 bard (me) 22 warrior,<br/>\n23 rogue, 24 monk, 24 enc, 24 dru.<br/>\n--after the 2nd fight (in which the bard, warrior die) we discover that this is<br/>\nnot your &quot;standard equipment&quot; druid...he informs us (mid fight) that he is not<br/>\na: Cleric (ie-won&#39;t heal), Mage (won&#39;t Damage Shield), ranger (won&#39;t Snare), or<br/>\nbard/shaman (won&#39;t buff or SOW)...he is convinced that he is most efficient<br/>\ntanking and nuking.  I am reasonably certain when he gets to 29, he will say<br/>\n&quot;i&#39;m not a taxi either&quot;..grr.<br/>\n<br/>\nas far as my &quot;optimal&quot; group, assuming all players are equal :/ ...i would have<br/>\nto say Warrior (preferably a fat one),  Monk, Cleric, Enchanter, Dr00d (sorry),<br/>\nBard.  (i would also like a member of said group to have a friend who is a<br/>\nshaman that can make shrink potions, and a mage to summon bandages.....but i<br/>\nsuppose that those are not necessary)  I think that this configuration gives<br/>\nthe group everything it needs (except bandages and shrink) and some redundancy<br/>\nin some areas as a safety factor. (2 people with snare-like object, 2 people<br/>\nwith crowd control, 2 people with nukes, 2 ppl with healing (not counting<br/>\nbard).<br/>\nas always, your mileage may vary :)<br/>\n&lt;/Ramble&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd Song Half Elf Bard<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss<br/>\n27th level Dark Elf Magician<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexuszszs or something like that<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
