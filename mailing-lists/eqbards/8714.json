I guess I will just have to<br/>\nbalance being patient and getting the items for myself versus the<br/>\npracticality of purchasing them.  If I decide to get the items for myself, I<br/>\nthink my best option may be to get to 32d level and start grouping with high<br/>\nlevel groups.  I&#39;ll be their mana bard in exchange for letting me loot the<br/>\nquest components.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I can understand wanting to get Lambent armor as soon as you can.  <br/>\n&gt; Personally though I do not plan on buying any of the components (except<br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; the gems of course), why?  Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>\n&gt; acquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>\n&gt; want the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>\n&gt; takes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; the right way to go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>\n&gt; the looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad<br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; there own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>\n&gt; bonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>\n&gt; market to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending<br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; the item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop<br/>\n&gt; caring <br/>\n&gt; about how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
