Verant&#39;s put in a lot <br/>\n&gt; of effort to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minimize the different &quot;looks&quot; of armor out there and <br/>\n&gt; basically take the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor that is already in the game, and &quot;colorize&quot; it to <br/>\n&gt; represent different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; types. The banded armor for Half Elf is also used for <br/>\n&gt; &quot;blackened&quot; armor. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;bronze&quot; armor is used for Mithril/Lambent/Plate (probably <br/>\n&gt; barnacle) and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe Imbrued.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On this issue, I understand the technical reason why they made so<br/>\n&gt;   few textured armor looks.  It all boils down to leather/chain/plate<br/>\n&gt;   with colorization across all races.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My gripe is that once you reach higher levels you should stand out<br/>\n&gt;   with the best armor / weapons in the game.  Right now I look like<br/>\n&gt;   a L20 bard, but instead of bronze (orange) plate I have inbrued <br/>\n&gt;   (pee yellow) plate.  People say, nice Yk and Fine Steel Morning <br/>\n&gt;   Star?  Why do you wield that?  Can I buy yer Yk, pls...  And I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;   like dude, get lost, heh... it&#39;s not a friggin Ykesha, and this<br/>\n&gt;   &#39;fine steel ms&#39; would clobber you.  hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I do like the extra little flourish they added a while back to our<br/>\nflashing lights around level 24 or so.
