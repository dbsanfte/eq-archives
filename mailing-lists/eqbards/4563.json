If you believe that you start out &quot;at<br/>\nyour peak&quot; then it would be all downhill from there, which makes no sense<br/>\nsince your other skills currently improve as you go. If you&#39;re starting at<br/>\nyour peak, all your skills should be peaked as well, and decline from there<br/>\ndue to old age. If you believe that you start as a newbie with no experience<br/>\nor skills, then you&#39;re starting young and the best you can be is (currently)<br/>\nat level 50 - which to me would be your &quot;peak&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying people should be able to<br/>\n&gt; raise their skills to uncomprehendable<br/>\n&gt; numbers with skill points, but they should <br/>\n&gt; be able to raise them to their natural<br/>\n&gt; maximums over time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ack!  That&#39;s even worse! You want everyone<br/>\n&gt; to be clones of each other?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You misunderstood me. I didn&#39;t mean that ALL of their abilities should be<br/>\nable to be raised to their maximums at the same time, but more that the<br/>\nmaximums should stay the maximums. So that if I for example had a maximum<br/>\npossibility of 110 STR, I would never be able to increase STR past that<br/>\n(without magical means). I&#39;m also not talking about major modifications over<br/>\na character&#39;s life. It could be something as little as 1 point ever other<br/>\nlevel for a total of 25 points possible in a characters life. Over what, 7<br/>\npossible places to put that and if you kept the maximums on each one -<br/>\nthat&#39;s really not that much of a difference, but would still help those that<br/>\nwish they could build up their strength or charisma or something.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
