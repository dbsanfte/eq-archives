I&#39;ve been tracking this<br/>\never since I got Guardian.  It seemed odd to me too, but<br/>\nGuardian has the advantage of stacking with certain other<br/>\nsongs (mainly Elemental and Purifying and so far all of the<br/>\nPsalm series) and giving a bigger AC boost.  A couple levels<br/>\nago, I&#39;d go from 45 to 90 MR playing Elemental, and from 90 to<br/>\n135 MR playing Guardian on top of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
