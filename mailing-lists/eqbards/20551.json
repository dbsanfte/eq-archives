If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-102330969\">Having grouped with a Mage for 51 Levels, I figure I should share my <br/>\nopinion on the subject. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, it&#39;s bad players, not bad classes.  Period.  If you <br/>\ntake a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50 (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to <br/>\nbet he&#39;s not a very good group player.  So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids <br/>\nall have a slight disadvantage in that they can solo, so they might <br/>\nnot pick up the group acceptable behaviors along the way, while Bards <br/>\nare generally forced to group and thus forced to figure out HOW to <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nPet classes in particular have a little more trouble in that their <br/>\npets aren&#39;t smart.  But, knowing how dumb pets are, a good mage can <br/>\ncontrol him... and pets have gotten smarter over the course of <br/>\ncommercial.  I remember when they&#39;d run off if sent to attack a <br/>\nred. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like this mage in particular needs to be taught how to <br/>\na) /assist b) /pet back off and c) understand that he/she does not <br/>\nhave to get the kill.  There are bugs with assist, so having <br/>\nan /assist key is not foolproof.  Being aware of their role what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on is a definite advantage. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always thought that a group of 4 mages, 1 bard and 1 cleric in <br/>\nthe right spot could mow thru mobs and exp so fast, it&#39;d be <br/>\nunbelievable.  We often group with no tanks, letting the pet be the <br/>\nprimary tank... I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for most dungeon settings, <br/>\nbut in controlled settings (usually outdoor, but not always - said <br/>\nmage and I controlled The Kly room alone) it works great.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
