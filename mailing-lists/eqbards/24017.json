If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate Dirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>\nonce every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m not mistaken), it should, in at<br/>\nleast some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant effect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>\nyou get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual outcome of any fight, and is<br/>\nactually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which wakes up anything mezzed)<br/>\ncoupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed, frequently without damaging them in<br/>\nthe slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are laughably small compared to the<br/>\nincreased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am inconvenienced only in that we were theoretically limited to one song<br/>\n&gt; per level and I don&#39;t get one at that level due to 7% of the people.
