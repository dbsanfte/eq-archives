He asked if I could play the Jig<br/>\nfor mana regen.  I explained that it is an illusion and explained why it<br/>\nseems to work.  I also mentioned this list and the results found here, and<br/>\nmy own investigation on the subject, which matches the lists conclusions.<br/>\nHe said that he had tested it and that he found that it DID work.  I asked<br/>\nif he played a bard and he did not.   We had quite a few casters in the<br/>\ngroup, all apparently waiting for the outcome of our squabble.  So I<br/>\nsuggested that we go to the arena and test it, but he did not want to.<br/>\nNeither did I for that manner, but I had to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppart from the Druid, all of the other casters seemed to take my word for<br/>\nit.  I think that mentioning the EQBARDS list and the extensive testing that<br/>\nmany players do, gave at least some credit to what I was saying.  I imagine<br/>\nthat seeing a character who is so concerned and intrested in his class that<br/>\nthey would join a mailing list and, be active in serious discussion about<br/>\nhow to play the Bard, gave them confidence.  At least I think it did.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was either that or the fact that the Druid in question got himself and<br/>\nhalf the party killed while pulling from the top of the Aviak village,<br/>\nbefore we all decided that we needed to regroup without him :(<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet &lt;Mischief&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel of Bristlebane<br/>\n23rd Human Bard<br/>\non Brell Serelis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 3:18 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] soloing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they continue to insist I play the Jig, I tell them that would require me<br/>\nto replace one of the eight songs that could actually benefit the group.  If<br/>\nthey continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>\npeace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>\nsong slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance of<br/>\ndying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.  Therefore, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me how to<br/>\nplay mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, the occasions where I run into people who don&#39;t believe me<br/>\nwhen I tell them the Jig has no effect on mana regen are becoming relatively<br/>\nfew.  I assume thats because the other bards on E&#39;ci (Faras, Kitasi, Aloro,<br/>\net al) have spread the word and a lot of people are now aware of how the<br/>\nsong works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;When people ask me to play Jig to increase mana, I use a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;condensed version of Talies explanation and they usually <br/>\n&gt; &gt;accept it.  If they don&#39;t, their problem not mine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I know Jig, a song intended for other purposes, does<br/>\n&gt; nothing for mana (has been tested and timed) you cannot <br/>\n&gt; dump that type of attitude out on your party.  As a bard<br/>\n&gt; you are responsible for group coordination through tactics<br/>\n&gt; and song, unless an enchanter has that current role in your<br/>\n&gt; group.  You also, imo, are there to keep the group solidly<br/>\n&gt; happy - with humor/jokes/antics.  If someone in my group <br/>\n&gt; asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>\n&gt; notion mind you) - I will happily do it.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>\n&gt; to mislead them, but if it makes them feel better, most of<br/>\n&gt; the time the extra security makes them play sharper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s called the Placebo Effect, a proven psych theory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 38th unchained melody.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
