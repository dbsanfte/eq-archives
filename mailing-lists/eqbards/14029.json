I was hoping to do this quest but can&#39;t<br/>\nget my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in Erudin to get the<br/>\nGuild master to give me the quest or any other quest for that matter.  I<br/>\nused the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent but that is as<br/>\nHigh as I can go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also looked to see if there were any other ways to raise my faction but<br/>\ncould only find the Odus Pearl quest which raises faction with the Knights.<br/>\nUnfortunately, it is given by the same guy in the guild and needs a<br/>\ncontainer he gives you to complete it.  Again, he won&#39;t talk to me about any<br/>\nquests.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi, you are the king of quests from what I hear, maybe you know what I<br/>\ncan do.  Or if, in fact it is a lost cause.  Anyone who has any info can<br/>\nshare, not just Kit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
