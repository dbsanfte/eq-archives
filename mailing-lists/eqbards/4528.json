It does stink that<br/>\nwe take so long to mem songs, especially the new ones. But I wonder if its<br/>\nintelligence based, level based, or usage based. If we sit and mem a song<br/>\nover and over does the time improve? Thats the way many games used to work.<br/>\nI am also ticked that when Verant patched last week to &#39;fix&#39; the missed<br/>\nnotes on higher level songs, I now miss notes on all my songs even Selo and<br/>\nHymn. I never use to miss notes on Chain till this patch, anyone else having<br/>\na problem twisting because of this? It throws my whol rhythm if I miss a<br/>\nnote and then have to re-sing the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother feature I would like to see is a pop-up to one side that has all the<br/>\npet commands. Anytime you have a pet to control either you have this popup<br/>\nor a button like social that lists all the pet commands.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 6:54 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Limit on song memorization<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone think that bards should not be limited to<br/>\n&gt; memorizing only eight songs at a time?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see 8 more bubbles on the right side of the screen opposite the<br/>\n8 we all have now. Verant could even make it so that it&#39;s a level thing that<br/>\nyou couldn&#39;t use the other 8 spots until say level such and such (15+) like<br/>\ndual wield. Makes sense. You get more experienced and are able to remember<br/>\nmore songs. Especially if you&#39;ve been playing the first 8 songs for 15+<br/>\nlevels of your life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem <br/>\n&gt; with this. Many of their spells at higher levels are just<br/>\n&gt; improved versions of spells they had at lower levels.<br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t really have to worry about memorizing their low<br/>\n&gt; level spells once they reach a certain point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d disagree here. Spellcasting classes use spells all of their lives and<br/>\nnormally have much higher INT/WIS stats than we as Bards do. Thus it would<br/>\nmake more sense for them to be able to expand their # of memorized spells<br/>\nthan not.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\nFor details and to order, go to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
