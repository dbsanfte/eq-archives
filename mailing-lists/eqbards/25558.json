As far as when they&#39;ll come back up...<br/>\nwell, not to disillusion you or anything, but I<br/>\nsaw a supposed 5 hour patch last for 15 hours<br/>\nbefore... Go take your dog for a walk or do some<br/>\nlaundry... the servers will be back up<br/>\neventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just so you know, I&#39;m friggin&#39; dying for them<br/>\nto come back up myself... I&#39;ve had the Ring of<br/>\nthe Ancients for  days (since Halloween!!) and<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been able to get my Jboots because of the<br/>\nzone changes to Rathe Mountains...

With no SoW!<br/>\n&gt;  And for what?  Sure we had <br/>\n&gt; zones - two of &#39;em. In black and white.  And<br/>\n&gt; only one mob.  The mangy <br/>\n&gt; rat.  People camped that rat for hours, and<br/>\n&gt; every kill-stole from everyone <br/>\n&gt; else.  Not that it mattered. The rat only had 1<br/>\n&gt; copper for loot.  And since <br/>\n&gt; everything cost at least a platinum, nobody<br/>\n&gt; could afford any good <br/>\n&gt; equipment.
