I normally play these songs during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; downtime to relieve the cleric of curing duties.  Up until last night, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or<br/>\n&gt; disease,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on<br/>\n&gt; group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; member Soandso.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was<br/>\n&gt; cured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same<br/>\n&gt; thing?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the<br/>\n&gt; weekend,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broken.  The possibility is also that my group was unresponsive to me,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is simply the success message which is broken.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lago<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
