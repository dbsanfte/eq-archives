There was no minimum MR/CR demand<br/>\nThats it..<br/>\nI myself was one of the people who did not realise just how important those<br/>\nresists is. I was not clawed once. All damage I took was from breath and my<br/>\nhealth dropped by 1/4 each time I dident resist! 4 unresisted breaths and I<br/>\nwas dead.<br/>\nMind you I played resist songs with my drum and had my buffed MR/CR well<br/>\nabove 100, but that was not enough.<br/>\nNext raid I will only go if I can take my MR/CR (or HR if nafgen) to 100<br/>\nunbuffed. <br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker, bard o 47th songs, bertox (I better stop fooling around and get<br/>\nleveling again, Windleaf is ahead of me :P *grin*)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub9.ezboard.com/bcreatorspath\">http://pub9.ezboard.com/bcreatorspath</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=1598&sortby=character_name&\">http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=1598&sortby=character_name&</a><br/>\nshowroles=1<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 18. maj 2001 08:46<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Level for Vox raid?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\nI hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on<br/>\nRodcet Nife.
