(I think crowd control<br/>\nbegins with a good puller and ends with mez and charm).  Enchanters are the<br/>\nbest at this, we are almost the only second option.  Stick and root is a<br/>\npoor third.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe person in my guild I group with the most is our enchanter (we are a<br/>\nsmall guild, I am the only bard, and we have 2 enchanters in the above 30<br/>\nrange).  We do great as we can add just about any third (or more) to us and<br/>\nbe successful. With just the two of us, its a bit rough as our damage output<br/>\nis pretty flimsy.  (We try to find groups of mobs and both charm one, and<br/>\nlet them beat each other sensless, but its hairy sometimes without a<br/>\nhealer).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clarities stack.  This is a good thing.  Divide up the buffing and<br/>\ndebuffing depending on the mobs your fighting.  Divide up the crowd control<br/>\n(basically if we get 2 mobs, I charm, otherwise she mezz&#39;s and I just back<br/>\nher up and keep her alive).  Having multiple stunners is great against<br/>\ncasters.  Fighting in Dalinar&#39;s most the casters we faced never got a spell<br/>\noff (our third was a troll warrior so he was bashing too).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have never seen met a class I didn&#39;t like to group with.  Merely<br/>\nplayers I didn&#39;t like to group with.<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro  33 Bard, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
