Mainly because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t use it at first because I didn&#39;t realize how powerful it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter MUCH experimentation, here&#39;s the best method I&#39;ve found to get the<br/>\ntiming...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst you need to know the timing of your regular songs pat. I can do 3<br/>\nsongs with no trouble and about a half a tick of leeway if I do it right.<br/>\n(if I anticipate the pulse and drop my songs earlier I can get 4, but it&#39;s<br/>\nunreliable and very difficult in a fight)<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually do this:<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm<br/>\nOff Song<br/>\nOff Song<br/>\n<br/>\nslight pause to allow for the leeway. (anywhere from 1/4 of a tick to 3/4 of<br/>\na tick depending on how good my juggling was and whether there were any<br/>\ndropped notes)<br/>\n<br/>\nRe Charm<br/>\n<br/>\nLack of room on my palette usually requires me to sing the same off song<br/>\ntwice, so I try to make it a useful song for the situation. (usually pixie<br/>\nstrike vs high caster concentration areas or snare if there&#39;s no druid.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy palette is organized as such:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Charm<br/>\n2) Off song<br/>\n3) /pet attack (social key)<br/>\n4) /assist [main tank] (social key)<br/>\n5) /pet back off (social key)<br/>\n6) /pet guard here (social key)<br/>\n<br/>\n/pet back off is there in case my pet decides to beat on a party member<br/>\ndespite my orders and /pet guard here is there so I can stop him from pacing<br/>\nafter he&#39;s finished killing his former teamates and I&#39;m waiting for charm to<br/>\nbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a while to get used to the timing, but once you do, you may never<br/>\ndemem it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
