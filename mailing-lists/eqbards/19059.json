Decided to<br/>\n&gt;go do the crafted armor quest with a griffon eye.  Bought 2 Fire Emeralds in<br/>\n&gt;FV and teleported to NK.  Went to see the Centies and even made him tell me<br/>\n&gt;about the quest.  But when I gave him the stuff, he gave me the &quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>\n&gt;forgetting something&quot; for the eye (which I expected) and then nothing for<br/>\n&gt;the gems.  Sheesh.  This is the 2nd time in a month that I have failed doing<br/>\n&gt;crafted armor quest.  Other one was for crafted bp - lost the werewolf talon<br/>\n&gt;and rubys. Grrrr.  Of course, I petitioned and was told &quot;sorry, can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;replace items... send email to ...&quot;  Anyone else know anything about the<br/>\n&gt;crafted armor being bugged somehow?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Missing old school friends?
