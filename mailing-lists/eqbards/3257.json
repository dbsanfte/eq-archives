It really comes in handy when you start to get into trouble in a fight and you can twist Hymn with Chant of Battle or Jonathon&#39;s Whistling Warsong. Now that you have Boastful Bellow, you really need to start twisting that with Anthem De Arms or Hymn, whichever the situation. Start out twisting Bellow with Anthem, then if your hitpoints start getting low, twist Bellow with Hymn, and throw Anthem in there just for good measure if you can.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maybe I&#39;ll try pottery to make some extra money. I&#39;ve been doing brewing for awhile, and that you can maybe make 5-10pp in an hour, and it gets very tedious. Its not really practical for me to go to Halas right now, I&#39;m in Freeport. Where is a good place to do pottery on the eastern coast of Antonica or anywhere on Faydwer? Also, where can I get the book on pottery?<br/>\n   <br/>\n   Tanthalias<br/>\n   Half Elven Bard, 12th Circle<br/>\n   Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
