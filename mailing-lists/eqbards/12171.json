(Probably<br/>\n32 to 35?)  I was just  there Christmas Eve in a group with<br/>\nmid-to-upper-30&#39;s and maybe a 40.  We cleared all the bats and bugs and<br/>\nfrogs. I read here that a bard used lament and could pull less than the<br/>\nwhole room - so I asked the group if they were up for trying it.  And they<br/>\nsaid sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI carefully moved around lamenting them all and then tried to pull the one<br/>\nclosest to the door.  It happened pretty fast but I think one from the rear<br/>\npulled but 3 of the 5 stayed in the room.  We killed the 2 pretty easily.<br/>\nAnd then pulled the rest of the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did this 3 times.  The 3rd time I went to lament the first one and lament<br/>\nwas resisted, he agro&#39;d and the whole room pulled.  That was not good.  I<br/>\ndid not have Lullaby memmed as I was using Pixie but the situation was<br/>\ntotally out of control.  I gave a shout for &quot;help in the bedroom&quot; and<br/>\ninstantly a lev 50 enchanter and lev 50 wiz popped in and the enchanter<br/>\nfired off AE mez and all the skellys went to sleep.  Well, all except the<br/>\none the tanks were beating on. Thank the Gods they were /assisting!!!  The<br/>\nhi lev&#39;s saved our butts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you have taken them?  I would have to say no - maybe you could handle<br/>\na single - but you don&#39;t get singles easily. And then if you get a room<br/>\nspawn, you have real trouble.  They are nasty casters and can burn you down<br/>\nvery very fast.  Especially if you get more than one.  If you get the whole<br/>\nroom - it&#39;s a disaster - even for a mid to upper 30&#39;s group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen 2 groups - like 8 or so mid 30&#39;s move past them - agro the room<br/>\nand then proceed to kill them all without too much difficulty.  But trying<br/>\nto pull them in singles - is risky.  At lo 30&#39;s, fighting 5 red cons at the<br/>\nsame time is simply too much.  I would be surprised if your party could all<br/>\nmake the zone if you had to run - and not sure the druid would have been<br/>\nable to evac if she was getting burned by the skells.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.
