I haven&#39;t played in a while, but was wondering if <br/>\nanyone had heard whether or not the overhaul being done to the character <br/>\nmodels will include an actual drum graphic for bards? Last I recall, quite <br/>\nsome time ago, when asked whether or not they&#39;d be correcting it, they said <br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t because it was too involved to address at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since they&#39;re re-doing the models for Luclin, I wonder if it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be the perfect opportunity to fix this animation? Just wondering <br/>\nif anyone knew of their intentions?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you all get Luclin up and running tomorrow and find out, if you <br/>\ncould post to the list that would be great.. I doubt my copy of Luclin will <br/>\ncome in for a couple days yet. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nKonus<br/>\n51 Songs on the Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
