If I see<br/>\n&gt;something really bad, like healers not healing when people are low I<br/>\n&gt;will say something.  I also always harp on assisting the tank, but<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, I&#39;m a lot more comfortable saying something to someone else<br/>\nplaying a druid, enchanter, or bard (the three classes I have played<br/>\nmyself to highish levels) than another class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;people never seem to figure that one out.  People do all kind of crazy<br/>\n&gt;things, &quot;Damage shields are worthless&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t think you need SOW to<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I played a druid who damage shield&#39;d her monk on every pull.<br/>\nand finally got convinced this is NOT best usage of mana. At least at my<br/>\nlevel, if they are generally pulling singles, it isbetter use to cast<br/>\nthe DoT Stinging Swarm (about the same mana, MUCH more damage) than<br/>\nShield of Barbs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;pull.&quot;.  My reaction depends on my mood mostly.  If they want me to pull<br/>\n&gt;and won&#39;t SOW me (this being my troll warrior, not my self SOWing bard),<br/>\n&gt;he will just sit there till he gets a SOW or sees a mob withing bow<br/>\n&gt;range.  He will not move.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Generally SoW is kept up on everyone in the party. Even if it means<br/>\nlengthening downtime to get it up. But, esp when a person gets it, this<br/>\nis a high mana spell. So I can at least understand why someone may<br/>\nfoolishly not realize how important it is when they are younger. I know,<br/>\nas a druid, early On I sometimes would not cast SoW on myself, to<br/>\nsave the mana. Yes, the puller needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(though in Kunark, the puller has to be even more careful not to outrun what<br/>\nthey are pulling)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You don&#39;t want to give me hp/ac buffs?  Fine,<br/>\n&gt;but don&#39;t assume I&#39;m going to keep taunting stuff off you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>About the only time I won&#39;t buff folk is when I&#39;m low on mana<br/>\nand we are in a situation where we can&#39;t/won&#39;t stop pulling.<br/>\nI want to make sure I have mana for healing/crowd control (depending<br/>\non whether I&#39;m playing my druid/enchanter)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I really hate getting pick up groups, but fortunatly I have a good<br/>\n&gt;memory, so I know who to refuse to group with.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, I have to depend on writing down problem players :(<br/>\nI am more likely to remember people that I like grouping with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara Daring, level 21 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 17 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Qeynos) /<br/>\n&lt;lvl 6 paladin -- baby BASHer!&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
