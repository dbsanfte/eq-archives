Currently - my mage on my current server is lvl 31 - in just a<br/>\nfew short weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my bard - I was a craftsman first and foremost. 99% of my time was<br/>\nspent crafting - talking to people, helping newbies, etc. With my mage - I<br/>\nhave higher goals I need to reach to be the &#39;taxi&#39; she was originally<br/>\ncreated to be - therefore - leveling was a bit higher priority. With my<br/>\nbard - her only leveling goals was to be able to wander the zones she<br/>\nfrequented most - without getting jumped by every trash mob she ran across.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too wonder about folks that break their neck to hit 50. It&#39;s pretty<br/>\npredictible once you hit 50 in this world you are &#39;done&#39; - why are folks so<br/>\nvery determined to &#39;finish&#39; then get upset there is nothin new?<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse - if I ever hit 50 - I&#39;ll probably just revert back to my playstyle<br/>\non Veeshan - that&#39;s what I like to do best anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:44 PM 1/26/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: David Nolle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dnolle@...\">dnolle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>\n&gt;since about three weeks after release.

Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>\n&gt;than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?
