It&#39;s hard to <br/>\ndescribe where he is located, but I can tell you he roams a short corridor <br/>\nabove the Foreman&#39;s room. There is a goblin placeholder there most of the <br/>\ntime. The corridor has a door that leads to a room with stairs. Down the <br/>\nstairs and back around to the right leads to the Foreman&#39;s room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Who drops the Obsidian Shard?
