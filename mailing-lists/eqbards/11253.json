The<br/>\n\t\tquestion was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given<br/>\ntheir melee<br/>\n\t\tabilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant<br/>\ndesigned us.. if I<br/>\n\t\thad my choice between that belt and any instrument in the<br/>\ngame<br/>\n\t\t(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt.<br/>\nSurely the item<br/>\n\t\twould be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or<br/>\nranger. But is<br/>\n\t\ta bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all<br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\n\t\tTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
