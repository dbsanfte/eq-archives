He was actually pretty chatty, singing me a ballad<br/>\nand then telling<br/>\n\t\tme the story behind it.  He spoke of an old flame of his<br/>\n(her name was<br/>\n\t\tMatala, I think -- notes are at home) and how she had dumped<br/>\nhim for someone<br/>\n\t\telse and was now up to some nefarious purposes.  I got<br/>\nthrough the story and<br/>\n\t\ttried to get him to say more, but some idiot and his pet<br/>\nchose that moment<br/>\n\t\tto whack the poor bard, so I can&#39;t be sure that I got<br/>\neverything from him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAt the end of each section of text, Vhalen would ask if I<br/>\nwanted him to go<br/>\n\t\ton, but there were no brackets on anything.  Typing in what<br/>\nyou would expect<br/>\n\t\tto type in kept him going, however (e.g. &quot;I would like to<br/>\nhear more&quot;).<br/>\n\t\tUnfortunately, he never indicates any sort of action you<br/>\nshould take, he<br/>\n\t\tjust says that Matala (if I remember her name correctly)<br/>\nmust be stopped.<br/>\n\t\tAnyone else spoken to him lately?  Is this an old quest that<br/>\nI am just now<br/>\n\t\tdiscovering?  I&#39;d appreciate any guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tRanulf<br/>\n\t\tBard of 19 (almost 20) songs - Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the south east cornor of SK is a house surrounded by a stone wall.<br/>\nInside lives this hermit who is a ranger about level 20, skilled in the use<br/>\nof magic.  You can open the door to the wall but not to the house.  But you<br/>\nhave bardic songs that when played will make him come out and fight you.<br/>\nYou will need a good group to help you kill him - especially at your age.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I ever solo&#39;d him (but then I don&#39;t kite) - maybe after I was<br/>\n25.  He buffs himself with thorns and fights hard - with fine steel weapons<br/>\ntoo. When you kill him, you will find a &quot;broken lute&quot; (that wieghs 10<br/>\npounds!) and a page to the song.  Keep one only of each.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how you are supposed to know this - I have no clue since I did it all<br/>\nfrom spoilers but you take the flute to North Karana and give it to Cordelia<br/>\nMinister - the bardette who loiters near the wizard spires and patrols to<br/>\nthe northwestern shops.  She will give you the other page of the song and<br/>\nyou go back to Vahlen.  Give him both pages and he will reward you with a<br/>\nnew song!  Viola - Chant of battle!  Just in case your spell book catches on<br/>\nfire and you lose your existing song!  Woo Hoo am I ever glad I did that<br/>\nquest!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good part is the xp for slaying the hermit - affectionately known as<br/>\nHerman on our server and the FS weps he drops every 4 to 6 kills.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
