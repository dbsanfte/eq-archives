Hymn = 17hp/tic this=35hp/tic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Total= roughly 70hp/tic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I seriously doubt Verant will go for something like this that, on top of<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that, throws on Clarity, a spell shield, and whatever else nivs does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   70 hp / tick when mobs can hit in the multiple hundreds?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I can heal for roughly mid 30s in lguk and things hit for 100.<br/>\n&gt;   That&#39;s a third of the damage being done just in healing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I would hope I could stick to that ratio, and heal 100 per tick<br/>\n&gt;   when mobs can do 300-400 dmg per swing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You are not thinking ahead, you are stuck in this shell of a<br/>\n&gt;   broken game in the current state.  Thing are going to change.<br/>\n&gt;   Our songs have to be excellent at L60 versus L63 NPCs.  No one<br/>\n&gt;   is thinking down that path yet.  And it&#39;s even hard for me to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   +75 STR, and you&#39;re like OMG, that&#39;s too much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -or-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   +100 AC, *nothing* gives that much you think... well at L60<br/>\n&gt;   maybe it should.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Maybe we should heal 150 per tick with a +50 AC shield, I mean<br/>\n&gt;   when was the last L53+ mob you encountered without bringing<br/>\n&gt;   24+ people.  We&#39;re gonna have to fight L53+ mobs in groups of<br/>\n&gt;   six people, just like you fight L45 mobs in groups of six.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; MAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
