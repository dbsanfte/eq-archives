Secondly<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of two lesser camped places in Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerma is a bit tougher in that it trains much more easily. Get a decent map<br/>\n(http://www.eqmaps.com) and head to the preacer room. I group of 4 your<br/>\nlevel should be able to handle it easily, and you will have plenty of mobs<br/>\nto pull.<br/>\n<br/>\nNajena is just plain awesome. In all my time there I saw only one train, and<br/>\nthat train only had 4 mobs in it. The exp is great. TTs in particular (I<br/>\nmade all of level 24 in one night soloing TTs. I was the only person in the<br/>\nzone and had all 4 spawns to myself. Juggling Hymn, DDD and CoD I could solo<br/>\n2 at the same time with an ogre and end the fight with 3 bubs of health)<br/>\nAlso if you can find a group you can easily camp one of the nameds.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:snicker@...]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2000 1:08 PM<br/>\nTo: eqbards@onelist.com<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Level 22 woes (or why Unrest STILL sucks) LONG<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;snicker@...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I logged in my Level 22.5 bard last night for the first time in about<br/>\n2 months (I&#39;ve been playing a bunch of other classes for fun)<br/>\nI&#39;d put Talies away because of all the frustration that last few times I&#39;d<br/>\nplayed him.  Just FYI, he *was* 23rd once...<br/>\nHis current equipment:<br/>\nAll armour is bronze except for:<br/>\nBlackened Iron Crown, Bracer of Erollisi, Purity Belt, Banded Sleeves, 2<br/>\nstrength rings, 2 strength earrings, Grotesque Mask, so AC and STR aren&#39;t a<br/>\nproblem.  He&#39;s actually not overloaded, either, so that&#39;s no big deal.<br/>\nHe&#39;s also got a combine Longsword and a Dragoon Dirk for combat, and no<br/>\nmagical instruments, though he does carry one each of the normal ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s got two &quot;sets&quot; for songs for combat:<br/>\nSet 1: Outdoors/open areas (Instruments only)<br/>\nA) Chords of Dissonance<br/>\nB) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\nC) Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>\nD) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\nE) Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>\nF) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\nG) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\nH) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n<br/>\nSet 2: Indoors/tight quarters (combat bard)<br/>\nA) Anthem de Arms<br/>\nB) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\nC) Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>\nD) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\nE) *varies*<br/>\nF) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\nG) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\nH) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, last night I logged on, I was on Faydwer, and didn&#39;t want to leave the<br/>\ncontinent (not having a whole bunch of time to get a bind somewhere else),<br/>\nso I went to Unrest.  Found a group in no time (hurrah for bards), group<br/>\nwas 1 Necro, 1 Cleric, 1 Ranger a Warrior (I think) and me.  No problem -<br/>\nthe Warrior, the Ranger and the Necro&#39;s pet can tank, while the Cleric and<br/>\nI support.  The Warrior was pulling.<br/>\nThe Warrior died on the first pull (trained/rooted), the Necro decided to<br/>\nleave.  The Ranger got an XP res.  We filled in the missing spots, while<br/>\nwaiting for the Warrior to return, with another Necro and a Wizard.  This<br/>\ntime, (since they seemed to think I can&#39;t get rooted) I was assigned to<br/>\npull duty.  I&#39;m not very familiar with the area, so after scouting the<br/>\nwhole ground floor (emtpy), I hear about the two new members and zoom back<br/>\nto check them out.  When I get back, the Warrior appears and starts looting<br/>\nhis corpse.  Suddenly, we get an &quot;Inc RED&quot; from the Ranger.  He dies.  Um -<br/>\nwasn&#39;t I pulling?  Anyway, naturally, we had to wait for the Ranger, so<br/>\nwhile we were waiting, I scouted again, this time up to the second<br/>\nfloor.  &quot;Hey, guys, what&#39;s a &quot;Khrix Fitchoff&quot; &quot;BAD BAD BAD!!! Don&#39;t<br/>\ntouch!  That&#39;s what killed the Ranger!&quot;  &quot;Um - okay - he&#39;s not bothering<br/>\nme.&quot;  I guess Necro&#39;s don&#39;t mind Bards.<br/>\nAnyway, we decided to camp the ghoul magi room.  We all get there (except<br/>\nthe Ranger, who is still on his way back), and all of a sudden &quot;A Skeletal<br/>\nMonk hits you for 75.  A Skeletal Monk hits you for 49.&quot;  I looked around,<br/>\nno monk.  I ran to the other side of the room - how nice, a ghoul.  We<br/>\nstart smacking it down (I&#39;m just healing at this point) and the ghoul gets<br/>\nout of the room - no one can seem to get a snare or root to stick.  Oh, how<br/>\nnice, just outside the room are two MORE ghouls, and a werebat.  And<br/>\nEVERYTHING is beating on the poor Bard.  FLEE. DIE.<br/>\nOkay, I get back, and first thing I hear is &quot;Don&#39;t run, next time.&quot;  Gee,<br/>\nthanks.  Run back to Unrest, find my corpse, loot and get back into Magi<br/>\nRoom.  Ranger starts to come for his bodies (yes, two - his first time<br/>\nback, Khrix killed him) and Khrix goes aggro on him AGAIN.  For some<br/>\nreason, Khrix REALLY hates the Ranger, so we decide to go outside.<br/>\nOn the wall, the usual bard hate summons us a Skeletal Monk and Undead<br/>\nKnight - no pull necessary.  I was just standing there, and blammo - there<br/>\nthey were.  As we&#39;re beating on them, a wave of lag hits the zone,<br/>\ndisconnecting our party one by one.  I jumped in to take the monk off of<br/>\nthe Ranger (the only one left tanking at this point) and he manages to<br/>\nfinish off the Knight by himself, while I get the monk down to half (not<br/>\nbad for a Bard, actually).  He and I play ping pong with the monk, but he&#39;s<br/>\ntoo chicken to solo the monk the rest of the way (we&#39;re both at two<br/>\nbubbles) so he backs off to let the monk beat on me while he heals<br/>\nhimself.  Naturally, I died.<br/>\nCome back, lost the Warrior, everyone else is disconnected.  Wizard decides<br/>\nto leave.  Go collect my corpse, and the cleric starts reassembling a party<br/>\nfrom what&#39;s left in the zone - a lot of people got disco&#39;d<br/>\napparently.  Nice lag-storm.  At least I was the only one in the party who<br/>\ndied.<br/>\nWe juggle 3 or 4 people who decide to leave immediately for other<br/>\ngroups.  Oh well.  I&#39;m very disappointed and frustrated - no<br/>\npositive  experience yet, and not even a chance to loot a bracelet.  We<br/>\nfinally flesh out the party with a Druid and a Shaman (who decides<br/>\nshrinking is cool).  So the 6 of us tiny people go take the round room by<br/>\nthe back door, since it&#39;s not camped.  I can&#39;t seem to find anything to<br/>\npull, so the Ranger gets sow&#39;d and pulls a nice bunch of ghouls, DBS&#39;s and<br/>\na Werebat.  Amazingly, we survive (I was only healing so that was the only<br/>\nsong I was using).  Next pull, I fire up my combat songs - DOH!  Wrong<br/>\nsongs!  &quot;A Ghoul Magi&#39;s Pet winces,  A Ghoul Magi Winces, A Carrion Ghoul<br/>\nWinces, A Carrion Ghoul Winces&quot;  RUN!!!!!  ZONE!!!!  Safely zoned.  Come<br/>\nback, apologize, we try one more time.  This time, we collect a train.  I<br/>\ndie first, so does the necro, party disintegrates.  My corpse is still in<br/>\nthe house, and there&#39;s no one willing to help.  Fortunately, it&#39;s just<br/>\ninside the back door, so I go, corpse it out to the back wall.  As I&#39;m<br/>\nbending down to pick up my stuff, &quot;A Carrion Ghoul hits you for 30! A<br/>\nCarrion Ghoul begins to cast a spell! You are Stunned. You are Rooted!&quot;<br/>\nEverytime I tried to run, I clicked on my corpse again and opened it up,<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t seem to get my view reset.  My girlfriend left the room at<br/>\nthis point, sick of the invectives I was throwing at the screen.  So, I<br/>\ndie, two feet from my other corpse.<br/>\nAll told, 4 deaths, so I head back to BB and camp - time to go play a<br/>\ncharacter who can actually gain experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there you have it.  Any suggestions before  I delete him?  I think if<br/>\nI can just get to 23rd, things will be much easier, with chains...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
