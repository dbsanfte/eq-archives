No cold hard facts, but I did do some tests one night<br/>\n&gt; when we were bored. Loaded up my packs with different armors and we hit<br/>\n&gt; lower guk. We choose the Crusader as our guinea pig. For those that don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know, he hits a lot for 120s. First, I loaded on the banded. 120s were<br/>\n&gt; common place, and average hits were around 80 to 90 a pop.

Very few 120s,<br/>\n&gt; average hits were in the 40s to 50s.<br/>\n&gt; The one thing to keep in mind though is when you are loading up the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>heavier<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; armors, is that you are going to be sacraficing on some of the stat<br/>\n </span></blockquote>raising<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; equipment. When you get to the higher levels with your bard though, the<br/>\n&gt; better armors with stat increases on them become available.<br/>\n&gt; On my bard I have the following main pieces:<br/>\n&gt; Mithral Breastplate<br/>\n&gt; Silvery Legs<br/>\n&gt; Skull Shaped Barbute<br/>\n&gt; Black Charred Boots<br/>\n&gt; Azure Sleeves<br/>\n&gt; 2 serp bracers<br/>\n&gt; elf hide gloves<br/>\n&gt; host of jewelry.<br/>\n&gt; With this setup and my jewelry, I have an agi of 170, and a dex of 160.<br/>\n&gt; Dunno if I really need those high of numbers, but I like high numbers =)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am able to dodge msot attacks, and when I do resort to using weapons (I<br/>\n&gt; prefer using instruments), I hit a lot and proc like a demon.<br/>\n&gt; While you may not see the numbers on your ac change very much with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>equipping<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the next level of armor available to you, the difference will be noticed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how much damage you take.

The theory is that stronger/thicker armor types may deflect a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;portion of the blow.  For example, the random generator decides you will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take 50 points of damage from a hit.  The results would be something like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Type Damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;No armor 50<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Leather 45<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Banded 40<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bronze 35<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Steel 30<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just made these up as an example.  Another theory is that the type of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;armor has no impact whatsoever.  In this case, the only thing that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;important is your AC.  A higher AC would mean a less chance of getting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;If you do get hit, using the previous example, you would take 50 damage<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you were wearing steel plate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have no idea what the correct answer is but since I have enough STR to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wear full bronze, its a moot point for me.

I&#39;d rather have access to more quests than fewer<br/>\n&gt; class-specific quests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 07:30:11 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE:Medium Bronze Armor (Spoiler)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were the elite guards at the back by the diplomat.

At level 30, with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For 30-50pts each.  That was a new and frighting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experiance.  I&#39;m hoping it was a bug.  Zoned out with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;half a bubble and a racing heart.  Anyone else take on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;these little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, to confirm your nightmare, it&#39;s no bug.<br/>\n&gt; I have been testing the skills of these shadowmen for the<br/>\n&gt; past few days.  Level 35 + MM drum, and they still overtook<br/>\n&gt; me, which absolutely confirms these creatures have SoN on.<br/>\n&gt; (since I&#39;m faster than SoC now).  However, you as a *bard*<br/>\n&gt; have a defense, that no others have...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me and a level 36 druid decided to check these little guys out.<br/>\n&gt; I got them on track in South Karana and headed over that way.<br/>\n&gt; They are invisible until you are almost on top of them, at which<br/>\n&gt; point you can see their name tags.  At level 35, two of the six<br/>\n&gt; conn&#39;d high green, then others all blue.  High green at level 35<br/>\n&gt; is equivalent to level 25.  My guess is these shadowmen are minimum<br/>\n&gt; level 25 and range up to level 30 tops.  (that is just a guess btw)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So we carefully scope them out, all warriors it seems.  And then<br/>\n&gt; we get a little braver, and approach them.  They scowl, ready to<br/>\n&gt; attack -- but do no such thing.  They are not aggressive.  The<br/>\n&gt; druid attempts to pull one from the crowd, and I stand ready to<br/>\n&gt; assist.  Instantly, all six shadowmen are on him... and he is<br/>\n&gt; steadily losing life, decides to personal gate, and eventually<br/>\n&gt; makes it.  I was stunned at what happened, but due to bard hate<br/>\n&gt; I was instantly swarmed...  40 dmg, 50 dmg, double attacks.  ugh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Screw this, I&#39;m outta here -- see ya fools!   &#39;click&#39; Accelerando.<br/>\n&gt; DOH!  Shit, the druid SOW&#39;d me!  &lt;sob, sob&gt;  (later to find out<br/>\n&gt; I couldnt outrun them anyway)  I was about to pull a Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt; manuveur:  Find a safe, easy to locate spot and curl up to die.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not today, fellow bards =)   Brass Horn to melee slot 2, &#39;click&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Screech.  Six shadowmen vanish in terror...  /shout shadowmen to<br/>\n&gt; bridge!  I make a run for it.  A few seconds later, the are on<br/>\n&gt; me again, damn they are fast.   2 or 3 flee, &lt;laugh&gt;  and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; still making a run for the bridge...  A few more return, only<br/>\n&gt; to be scared away by my pitiful brass skills.  I almost reach<br/>\n&gt; the bridge, and everything is calm.  They didn&#39;t follow me any<br/>\n&gt; further.  I speculate that since I had SOW and I was fearing them<br/>\n&gt; in the opposite direction, that we were spanning the zone at<br/>\n&gt; tremendous speeds, thus a time was reached when I exited their<br/>\n&gt; chase radius and they returned home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; MotS:  Screech, never leave home without it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 35th hell.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 10:14:04 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Ronnie Roads &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkroads@...\">rkroads@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Charm song- new: J-boots, hide<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Steven S.

While we do often stray off the<br/>\n&gt; path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards<br/>\n&gt; have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Discussions of<br/>\n&gt; Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil<br/>\n&gt; someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space<br/>\n&gt; (several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>\n&gt;   Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so will be<br/>\n&gt; immediately reviewed<br/>\n&gt; for warning, removal or banning.<br/>\n&gt;   On a related note, if you notice that your topic is straying from the<br/>\n&gt; original thread, please change the subject header.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>\n&gt; Battle Drums becomes:<br/>\n&gt; re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums)<br/>\n&gt; For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can make an attempt<br/>\n&gt; to change the subject field to something appropriate, that would help<br/>\n </span></blockquote>those<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>\n&gt; be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>\n&gt; make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST<br/>\n </span></blockquote>insult,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is<br/>\n&gt; being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has<br/>\n&gt; degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or<br/>\n&gt; when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>\n&gt; Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) No Attached Files!

Playing this instrument will<br/>\n&gt; generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related to<br/>\n&gt; your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, instrument skill is<br/>\n&gt; partially responsible for failure rate of related songs.  To avoid<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fizzling&quot; (missing notes) even when singing, keep your instrument skills<br/>\n&gt; maxed out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>\n&gt; A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>\n&gt;      The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), which increases the<br/>\n&gt; effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>\n&gt;      The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which has no<br/>\n&gt; discernible special effect.<br/>\n&gt;      Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) which has no known<br/>\n&gt; discernible effect.<br/>\n&gt;      Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which increases the<br/>\n&gt; effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>\n&gt;      McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 CHA<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>\n&gt;      Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of King<br/>\n&gt; Grobb are wind instruments with no known special effect.  They are,<br/>\n&gt; however, lighter than flutes, and don&#39;t cause that awful animation.<br/>\n&gt;      The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be non-magical wind<br/>\n&gt; instruments, but this still remains to be proven.<br/>\n&gt;      The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as a Greater<br/>\n&gt; Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument.  Other than that, it<br/>\n&gt; has no discernible special effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>\n&gt; A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while<br/>\n&gt; swinging a sword?<br/>\n&gt; A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand only items, they are<br/>\n&gt; also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash<br/>\n&gt; monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level?

This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>\n&gt; box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>\n&gt; you can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>\n&gt; spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To<br/>\n&gt; create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it<br/>\n&gt; down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself<br/>\n&gt; to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey<br/>\n&gt; slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated<br/>\n&gt; hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.<br/>\n&gt; Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is<br/>\n&gt; simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>\n&gt; A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>\n&gt; inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>into<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.

And if you *do*<br/>\n&gt; accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>\n&gt; run like crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>\n&gt; A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This<br/>\n&gt; means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield,<br/>\n&gt; pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of<br/>\n&gt; them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and<br/>\n&gt; Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these<br/>\n&gt; skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration<br/>\n&gt; speed for your party members?<br/>\n&gt; A: No.  What the Jig does is increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration<br/>\n&gt; every six seconds and hence the display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana<br/>\n&gt; bars to show this increase.

The<br/>\n&gt; amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>\n&gt; instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>\n&gt; song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>\n&gt; Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>\n&gt; level in the instrument that is required to play it.

Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>\n&gt; mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>\n&gt; someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.

Just last night I pulled out several items in my bank that<br/>\n&gt;      had been sitting around and tried the level 14 song on them.  To my<br/>\n&gt;      surprise three of them gave me extra info.  It seems that any item<br/>\n&gt;      that says illegible or blurred will now give you extra info with the<br/>\n&gt;      song.
