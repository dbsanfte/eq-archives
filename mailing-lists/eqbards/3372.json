The dragoon&#39;s dirk is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better than almost any combine/well balanced weapon.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would not waste any money on the store bought variety,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Demon claws are nice, but very expensive, and so is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PGT,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While the dirk by all means should be your first magic weapon,<br/>\n&gt; the combines are still a good choice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are around L10 and have managed to save enough for a<br/>\n&gt; combine and can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to make the trek to Crushbone for<br/>\n&gt; a dirk, by all means buy one.  You should be able to sell it<br/>\n&gt; later to a player for a profit, or to a merchant at a 10%-15%<br/>\n&gt; loss, so they do not really cost as much as their price<br/>\n&gt; indicates.  While the dirk has dropped the bottom out of the<br/>\n&gt; combine rapier market, the combine longsword and scimitar<br/>\n&gt; markets are still doing well because several classes that can<br/>\n&gt; use those but cannot use the dirk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are L17 or higher and already have a dirk, a combine<br/>\n&gt; for your off hand can be a good choice for the same reason.<br/>\n&gt; If you ever upgrade your off-hand weapon, you can easily<br/>\n&gt; liquidate the combine and get 80%-90% of your money back (more<br/>\n&gt; if you sell it to a player).  Unless you need the money *now*<br/>\n&gt; for something else, most combines only end up costing 5-10pp<br/>\n&gt; to own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
