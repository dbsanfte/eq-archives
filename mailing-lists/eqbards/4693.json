Ok, you can axe - they do sell for 75pp but I got what i think is a great deal at 50pp!  Some day a desparate rogue will pay me 100pp &lt;eg&gt; and I&#39;ll go back to my bear hide or have my lion skin gloves by then.  I declined a Troll Hide belt at 75pp.  Musta been a hell of a day deep in Guk somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. also looted an Aviak necklace dex +1 wis +1 lore no drop.  tried to give to a lev 2 bard by giving to a snake first and have him kill the snake. as luck would have it - snake i picked had a full loot load and the charm dissappeared into the mists.  practiced with a muffin and a fire beetle.  i never see fire beetle with more that 2 eyes and guessed that all these newbie mobs have 3 loot slots.  so if you are gonna try this trick -- beware - you can lose the item if the mob has a full loot load.  <br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. there ia a &#39;good&#39; npc in north qeynos - out side the gate to the west who whines about being almost killed by those dogs.  i killed him by accident one time - so he&#39;s real low level.  cant remember what factions got hit - it was before i even knew about faction.  but he has the normal amount of slots for a hummie or half elf and you could give to him - then kill him to pass the no drop item with more chance of not losing it.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s.s. is it worth it to do all these shenanigans? prolly not - just go kill the mob who drops the items.  But in all games (and computer programs) if it can be done - it will be done!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
