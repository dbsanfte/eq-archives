Most of us, I&#39;m sure, misunderstood the intent. (I know *I* did).<br/>\nIt looked to me like a typical MLM marketing message (which I get about 4<br/>\nmillion of a day.  Give or take.)  I think we misunderstood that your<br/>\n&quot;Great Story&quot; referred to the Lord Nagafen tale from the title, and thought<br/>\nthat it referred to the telephone number or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally apologize, and I just hope you can remember to add a little<br/>\nmore to your comments next time so we don&#39;t have any further &quot;oopses&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Service,<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nAssistant Moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
