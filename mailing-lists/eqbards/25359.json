If I want to solo - I&#39;ll<br/>\nplay Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 or even Diablo 2.  While others are more concerned<br/>\nabout leveling rapidly and gaining platinum etc - I can understand the<br/>\ndesire to solo; but I think what makes EQ a great game is the interaction<br/>\nbetween players.  Soloing too much leads to a lack of the skills that make a<br/>\nbard valuable in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never soloed in 56 levels and close to 2.5 years of barding.  I do a<br/>\nlot of raiding (regardless of our value or lack thereof).  I don&#39;t mean this<br/>\nas a slam against those who like to solo - just pointing out my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s interesting that the designers of EQ have spent SO much effort<br/>\non zones and encounters that are clearly dominated by large groups of raids;<br/>\nbut have done little to aid actually managing these.  The server filter is a<br/>\nhuge help - but changing the XP rules, and the lack of a dynamic raid<br/>\nchannel are a major hindrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concern for XP on raids is one thing that often leads to raid failure.<br/>\nCasters will be tempted to over nuke screwing up proper aggro management...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably too deep in code until EQ2 (who knows when that will come<br/>\nout) - but the ability to create a raid - similar to a guild in creation<br/>\nwould be great.  It should give another chat channel - and should share XP<br/>\nfor everyone signed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see it include people out of zone from dying  - if you die in<br/>\nthe encounter - but haven&#39;t been rezed when the mob was killed - you should<br/>\nshare in the XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see potential for abuse - but with though they could be minimized...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 5:15 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm well I can see your point, and  probably haven&#39;t noticed it because I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been on many raids with my bard.
