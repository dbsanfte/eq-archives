I remember reading on this board that someone who had died<br/>\nwould just go and kill a lizardmen with their DDD/COD songs and then buy a<br/>\nflute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other idea that John Kim mentioned a while back(and someone else more<br/>\nrecently), was that before you go to Cazic, load up on flutes, duel a friend<br/>\nin Ogguk and have him kill you, then loot everything except the flutes, so<br/>\nthat you&#39;d have a storage corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peck_white@...\">peck_white@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 14, 2000 8:02 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Finding a Flute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peck_white@...\">peck_white@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I went to Cazic Thule for the first time last<br/>\n&gt; night at 3/4 of a bubble to go to get to level 20.  I<br/>\n&gt; went because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>\n&gt; him.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>\n&gt; then proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>\n&gt; now have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>\n&gt; somewhere in the maze.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I want to know is...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>\n&gt; to the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>\n&gt; by.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>\n&gt; spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tomerrilin<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
