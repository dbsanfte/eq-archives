If so, why are they living in Solusek.<br/>\n  Why would the goblins even let them?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Did the Kobolds capture and lock up Nagafen?  Or are the kobolds<br/>\n  protecting Nagafen?  The fire giants protect Nagafen, but the <br/>\n  goblins don&#39;t like the fire giants, why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The kobolds have a goblin (guano harvester) that seems to be their<br/>\n  slave.  I mean who would walk about and collect bat poop in a bag<br/>\n  on their own?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do the kobolds dislike the goblins?<br/>\n<br/>\n  All this is painted on the walls of SolusekB, all these races<br/>\n  are repsented on the walls.  To answer your question here as<br/>\n  well Kit.  There are wall/cave paintings all over inside Solb,<br/>\n  they depict a story, I want to know the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
