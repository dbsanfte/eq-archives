Seems Roger Wilco has a memory bled that causes\r<br/>\nyou to have to log off and restart it after a half hour because the\r<br/>\ncommunication degrads. BattleCom on the other hand was solid enough\r<br/>\nthat Microsoft just brought them out to be able to make that internet\r<br/>\naudio actually PART of Windows 2000 for next summers release.\r<br/>\n  Give me BattleCOM any time. Relogging breaks up parties :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  You can DL BattleCom at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shadowfactor.com/\">http://www.shadowfactor.com/</a>\r<br/>\n  EVERYBODY should get this program and use it. I first ran into a group\r<br/>\nusing voice communications 2 weeks ago and they ran rings around\r<br/>\nother players in reacting to MOBs, tactics and all else. Having just gotten\r<br/>\nkilled because I couldn&#39;t type &quot;everybody on the spell caster !&quot; fast enough\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI am a true believer. Now, If you see Moonflower around ask her to\r<br/>\nstart a voice session !!!  It will get to the point that is the only way\r<br/>\nshe will play.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
