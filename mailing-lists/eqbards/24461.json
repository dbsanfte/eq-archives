There is no<br/>\nknown way to stop a mob from summoning unless its mezed.  If you come<br/>\naccross a 51+ critter and want to be able to get away....<br/>\n1. If you don&#39;t do damage to the creature it won&#39;t summon you.<br/>\n2. If the mob gets rooted it will summon anyone on its hate list, damage or<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n3. The mob will always summon the person on the top of its hate list even<br/>\nif they are in melee range all ready.<br/>\n4. In general a mob can summon a player about every 30 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome creatures use this as a tactic when they can&#39;t beat PCs fairly.<br/>\nSummoning is why high level caster mobs present so much of a problem.  Not<br/>\nonly can the casters gate when they are low on hit points, but once they<br/>\narrive at their bind point they can start summoning players individually<br/>\nand solo killing.  Thats why anytime your dealing with caster mobs 51+, you<br/>\nstun when they are low.  If your fighting stuff thats level 56+ mana tap,<br/>\ndon&#39;t waste your time with stun.  Level 56+ caster mobs are practically<br/>\nimmune to stun and mez.  About the only thing that works are knockback<br/>\neffects and even then the creature can regain its concentration and resume<br/>\ncasting.  So if your fighting a gateing/summoning mob thats 56+, mana tap<br/>\nfor all yoru worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
