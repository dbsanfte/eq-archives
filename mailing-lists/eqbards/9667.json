Has *any* imbrued armor dropped since <br/>\n&gt;the patch on this past<br/>\n&gt;Wednesday? The armor was supposedly moved to the plane of hate since it is <br/>\n&gt;no longer dropped on<br/>\n&gt;boogeymen, but none has dropped yet on any mobs on my server (Tarew Marr). <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m starting to<br/>\n&gt;believe Verant forgot to put our stuff in after they jacked it from <br/>\n&gt;boogeymen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 hours. And how <br/>\n&gt;hard is he? Does he<br/>\n&gt;cast any special type of spells?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a single mob is <br/>\n&gt;pulled, and about 3<br/>\n&gt;minutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and wipe out <br/>\n&gt;everyone? Even with monks<br/>\n&gt;feign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us fought so to keep <br/>\n&gt;aggro clear, we still<br/>\n&gt;get trained everytime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hiya, just got back from a Hate excursion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had the same problem with train, but it didn&#39;t happen as often as it <br/>\nseems to have happened with you.. ?
