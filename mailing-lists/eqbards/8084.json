Even as a Necro as my<br/>\nmain char I know when a Cleric should nuke or when he should hang back and<br/>\nuse heals. It&#39;s very easy to learn a class at least I believe so. Also as to<br/>\nhow much mana a spell takes that means nothing as you can learn that in<br/>\nseconds and know how much your spell is going to take. Believe me twinking<br/>\nwhen you have a high level char is no big deal if it allows you to by pass<br/>\nthe first 15 16 levels quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 4:11 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wed, 6 Oct 1999, Naeeldar wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Heh well then you have to talk with some 40+ people some more.

You<br/>\n&gt;still lack the intimate knowledge it takes to play the class<br/>\n&gt;well.  I know my cleric friends can heal, and I know they can<br/>\n&gt;nuke.  I know that sometimes it is better for them to use mana<br/>\n&gt;to nuke than to heal.  But aside from vague situations (e.g.<br/>\n&gt;mob that heals itself if you don&#39;t have a nuker), I cannot<br/>\n&gt;with confidence say when a cleric should nuke and when he<br/>\n&gt;should heal.  I have little or no idea how much mana these<br/>\n&gt;spells take, nor do I have their experience of hundreds if not<br/>\n&gt;thousands of situations where they&#39;ve tried a little bit of<br/>\n&gt;this or a little bit of that.  Just like I wouldn&#39;t expect my<br/>\n&gt;cleric friends to know when to switch from buffing, to MR, to<br/>\n&gt;healing with my songs.  You don&#39;t learn that until you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;played it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Besides which you don&#39;t learn much in the early levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That assumes that the same strategies work at all levels.<br/>\n&gt;While there are several meta-strategies that do work at all<br/>\n&gt;levels, as a bard you should know that what works and what<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t changes with each new song you get and each new level<br/>\n&gt;you gain.  If you&#39;re going to powergame solo to L50 to play<br/>\n&gt;with your L50 friends, then I&#39;d agree with you.  But if you<br/>\n&gt;plan to play the early/mid levels with other people, then it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;in your and their interest that you learn how to do it well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
