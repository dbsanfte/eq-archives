Because they have limited mana, if a caster nukes in the first<br/>\n&gt;half of a fight or the second half of the fight it doesn&#39;t matter they do<br/>\n&gt;the same damage and are just as effective damage-wise either way.  They<br/>\n&gt;would be wasting mana if they nuked constantly anyhow.  If a bard doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;sing for half the fight its a huge hit to their effectiveness, since there<br/>\n&gt;is no wasting of mana to deal with.  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>\n&gt;ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use his<br/>\n&gt;extra attacks for part of a fight?  Of course not.  The main reason to have<br/>\n&gt;nukers wait is because they have limited mana anyhow and they will avoid<br/>\n&gt;getting hurt and still do just as much damage by waiting.  Bards<br/>\n&gt;do not have<br/>\n&gt;this luxury.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Free shipping through 1/31/2000 at Visualize.com<br/>\n&gt;where you&#39;ll find limited edition prints & photographs<br/>\n&gt;for your home, office, collection or gift-giving needs.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/VisualizeJanuary</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
