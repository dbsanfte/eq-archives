I got killed after a<br/>\npage fault in EQGame.exe dumped me to windows in the middle of a fight.  The<br/>\nsenior guide who responded to my petition all but accused me of writing a<br/>\nprocess to purposely page fault eqgame whenever I was about to die so I<br/>\ncould get a free rez.  He further informed me that it was official Verant<br/>\npolicy to treat all customers as if they were deliberately causing page<br/>\nfaults in order to get free rez&#39;s unless incontrovertible proof otherwise<br/>\nwas available.  Like there could be such proof.  I sent in a long letter<br/>\nexpressing my displeasure with the page fault info from windows to our<br/>\nserver&#39;s Head GM, and various others at Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m beginning to think if we don&#39;t get Verant&#39;s attention regarding bard <br/>\n&gt;issues, we will continue to be ignored, to our detriment.

They have been /bugging the specific<br/>\nproblems with Alchemy for months and no one at Verant has seen fit to<br/>\nactually see if what they said was true.  This was posted just about<br/>\neverywhere over the weekend when Brad admitted they had been testing Alchemy<br/>\nincorrectly all along.
