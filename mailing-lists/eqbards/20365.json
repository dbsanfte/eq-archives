Also most clerics trade<br/>\noff ac for wis, so their ac is much worse than ours.  Still, we are not good<br/>\nenough to tank anything beyond 30ish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, anyone who wants their bard to be melee character is going<br/>\nto be disapointed.  However, I think this thread began questioning the power<br/>\nlevel of bards.  I hate hearing people who don&#39;t think bards hold up their<br/>\nend in a group.  If anything I think we may be overpowered (though once I<br/>\nhave to start using the mana draining charm song, I may, heh, change my<br/>\ntune).  Bard has a reasonably high miminum compotency level, which may lead<br/>\nto more badly played bard then some other classes, but a well played should<br/>\nadd to almost any group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
