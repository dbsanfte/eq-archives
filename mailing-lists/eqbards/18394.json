New guy priced them and did not look at old songs?  who<br/>\nknows *<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I saw the bard trainer thread, and saw no<br/>\n&gt; replies, so I&#39;ll assume thats a no (Eh, who cares about hide and safe<br/>\n&gt; fall?).<br/>\n<br/>\n* Not that I have found nor heard of. *  Anyhow, travel is not that hard.<br/>\nAnd if you go back for songs - train then.  Safefall you will want to have<br/>\nand prolly worth it to do some work to max it. Also, hide is one I<br/>\nneglected.  Trouble is that you need to con something to know if it worked<br/>\nand its capped low so its not as good (not even close) to rogues.  Might<br/>\nhave been different if I knew how it worked and maxxed it early. Later on,<br/>\nyou can buy your skills up as I probably will.  Although that wastes<br/>\ntraining points - hmm oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well so far its an intersting place.  I can&#39;t believe how big the agro<br/>\n&gt; radius on most of these things, but I can run fast :)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Heh * And I was thinking that the agro radius is pretty small or there is<br/>\nsome delay.  Stuff that should agro, I can run by fairly close.  Stuff that<br/>\ndoes agro, I can out run pretty easily.  I love my bard!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
