For example, in Fear, the players<br/>\n&gt;magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become scared.<br/>\n&gt;Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>\n&gt;they start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a player<br/>\n&gt;can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>start<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are hit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;constant heat that affects health and/or stamina.  In Air, constant gales<br/>\n&gt;that cause damage.  I came up with these on the fly so I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\n&gt;other things that could be done similar to these.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another year<br/>\n&gt;or so.  By that time, who knows how the game will work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;22 bard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; those<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>\n&gt;&gt; effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   150 SONGS FREE!
