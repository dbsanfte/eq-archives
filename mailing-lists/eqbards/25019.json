And of course the occaisional blip in NFP during peek times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI overclocked my 866 to 975 and only saw marginal improvement, so the better<br/>\nthe video card you can get the better off you will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GeForce2MX is also very overclockable.  Some overclock sites have seen<br/>\nclose to the GeForce2 GTS performance with the chip clock and memory clock<br/>\njacked up.   Beware, they added heatsinks and/or fans to BOTH the GPU and<br/>\nthe RAM on the video card.  Haven&#39;t done that yet, but am going to try it<br/>\nsoon.

Currently, the 2 best<br/>\n&gt; manufacturers<br/>\n&gt; (IMHO), are Creative and Hercules.  Others may disagree...heh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GeForce 3 is the newest and best out there.  If your budget is a bit<br/>\n&gt; smaller, check out the GeForce 2 line.  Buyer beware!  Some of the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bargain&quot;<br/>\n&gt; card manufacturers creatively label their cards such as they&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; untruthful, per se, but you could end up with a slightly different card<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; you thought you were getting, the difference usually being a slightly<br/>\n&gt; different clock speed.  Do your homework, read some reviews, pick a<br/>\n&gt; particular model, and don&#39;t look back.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I bought a GeForce256 DDR a little less than a year ago.  It&#39;s still a<br/>\n&gt; superb card, I haven&#39;t found a game yet that&#39;s too much for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cook Miller-ETOP03 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 1:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] OT - Equipment question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game<br/>\n&gt; graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP<br/>\n&gt; graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a<br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt; graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram -<br/>\n&gt; done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards<br/>\n&gt; they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything<br/>\n&gt; else<br/>\n&gt; of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some<br/>\n&gt; places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again for all the help,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Piemur Draggonsinger 42 bard<br/>\n&gt; Robiinton Masterrhealer 32 cleric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
