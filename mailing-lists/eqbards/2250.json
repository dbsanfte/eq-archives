Here is some of the advise that he<br/>\ngives me.  I&#39;m not loot hungry so I probably won&#39;t do<br/>\nit and it seems like you are not either, but it will<br/>\natleast help you get your banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all make sure you are hunting a loot heavy<br/>\nzone.  What I mean is since you are lvl 11, the best<br/>\nplace for you would be either Crushbone(Kelethin) or<br/>\nSplitpaw (South Karanas) or of course the Derv camps. <br/>\nI myself am not a big derv fan, because of all the<br/>\ncamping.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNext make sure you find a party that is high enough<br/>\nlevel to not care about loot in that zone.  For<br/>\nexample find a party of lvl 16+ that will take you in<br/>\nas an understudy.  That way they will  let you loot<br/>\npractically everything that comes their way, because<br/>\nthey probably care more about the exp.  Make sure you<br/>\nlet them know, that these are your intentions.  This<br/>\nis a an effective, but seldom used technique.  I have<br/>\ndone it a few times and I made about 15-20pp a night. <br/>\nBut it got old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally don&#39;t leave out anything, sell everything.  I<br/>\nhave seen a lot of people get shoulder pads, or<br/>\nlegionnaire belts or rustys, and I&#39;ve seen them just<br/>\nleave it on the corpse.  DON&#39;T!  It all adds up.  Just<br/>\nkeep collecting and selling, keep collecting and<br/>\nselling.  It takes discipline, but in about 3-4 days<br/>\nyou will be able to afford a full suit of banded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and one last thing, if you are hunting in<br/>\nCrushbone.  Make sure you sell at the Warror&#39;s guild<br/>\nin kelethin, they give great prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk I hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nFarewell,<br/>\n<br/>\nSedaien Reyvon<br/>\nlvl 20 Bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 22 Jun 1999 03:54:29 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Cash flow problems<br/>\n<br/>\nHail and well met again,<br/>\n    <br/>\n    I am requesting the assistance of some of you yet<br/>\nagain.  Tonight I<br/>\nfinally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons<br/>\nkilling the Derv&#39;s<br/>\nwhen lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated<br/>\nall but 2 of us,<br/>\nmyself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons<br/>\nand then<br/>\nreturning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the<br/>\nrealization that I needed<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing<br/>\nall leather.  It<br/>\nis affordable and light but is not as effective<br/>\nagainst the Derv&#39;s and<br/>\nsuch.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>\n    And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the<br/>\nplat to buy this<br/>\nwonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a<br/>\nnight at best. <br/>\nWould joining a guild help me in this situation?  If<br/>\nso does anyone no<br/>\nany good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>\nfighting darkweeds but<br/>\nthere is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my<br/>\narea have very<br/>\nlittle loot, so soloing in this area is pretty<br/>\nworthless.  The derv&#39;s<br/>\nhave lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with<br/>\npeople I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they<br/>\nactually attacked<br/>\nthe werewolf!!<br/>\nYesterday someone in my group decided, despite my<br/>\nwarnings, to walk up<br/>\nand slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for your advice,<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\n11th Rank Bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
