This being early in my spelunking<br/>\ncareer, I jogged off around the corner, thinking it could be in the next<br/>\nroom over.  I opened the door to lots of big nasty thing running straight<br/>\nat me, and promptly hightailed it to the zone (one lesson I had learned<br/>\nsooner).<br/>\n<br/>\nI returned to the landing and continued pointing at this wall.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfigure it out, how could the corpse be that way when there&#39;s nothing<br/>\ndirectly over that way?  Then Quellious whispered in my ear, and I<br/>\nrecalled seeing a dwarven corpse half in the wall up next to the zone.  I<br/>\ntold him to follow me, and he did (rather hesitatingly) back to the zone.<br/>\nI selected the corpse, and sure enough it belonged to him.  Mystery one<br/>\nsolved, enter mysteries two and three.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;What do you mean, my corpse isn&#39;t here.&#39;  Yes it is, I respond, I&#39;m<br/>\nselecting it right now.  Try typing /corpse.  Nothing.  Try looting it.<br/>\nNothing.  I&#39;d been working on him with this for at least half an hour, and<br/>\nfelt I&#39;d proven myself honest enough to offer a /consent Athren.  He<br/>\nconsiders for a few minutes, then decides to take the chance, and I<br/>\nrestore his much-missed bronze exoskeleton to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Before someone mentions targeting and /corpse&#39;ing it further out, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know about that at the time.]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third came about in a more mysterious fashion (as is the way of all<br/>\ngood enigmas).  I noticed another corpse nearby, also half stuck in the<br/>\nwall, and had seen the person who belonged to it nakedly camping the<br/>\nlocked door.  She had died in a similar location as the above dwarf, and<br/>\nher corpse &#39;washed up&#39; (the term I coined for this phenomenon) in nearly<br/>\nthe same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more piece of evidence to submit before drawing conclusions.  During a<br/>\nfishing spell in South Qeynos, I picked up a request for help in locating<br/>\na corpse on the Feline Island in Erud&#39;s Crossing.  With little else to do<br/>\nfor entertainment, I gladly sent in my resume, as this not only gave me a<br/>\nchance to help someone in a pinch, but also served as a much sought after<br/>\nexcuse to head further west into uncharted (speaking personally)<br/>\nterritory.  The two of us hopped the next boat (gosh this boat seems much<br/>\nfaster than Stormbreaker) to conduct our business.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaining the shoreline, my compatriot warned me of the sharks infesting the<br/>\nwaters nearby (a far cry from the safety of the Ocean of Tears, where I<br/>\nthrew myself to the waters ON PURPOSE in the name of exploration and ended<br/>\nup with an extremely boring three hour tour, but that&#39;s another story).<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s initial pulse told me the corpse was off the beach to the right of<br/>\nthe dock, and a few more pulses down the sand (three cheers for geometry)<br/>\nhad it at not too far off shore.  I exploited the &quot;almost underwater but<br/>\nnot quite&quot; bug which allows you to see under the surface the distance you<br/>\ncould above it clearly for a split second (shame on me, walk into water<br/>\nslowly to see what I mean), and spotted the body directly beneath two<br/>\nextremely disgruntled sharks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I had been a good little jack of all trades and was proficient enough<br/>\nat swimming to offer, for the cost of a /consent Athren, to drag his<br/>\ncorpse above sea level for easy reaquisition.  He graciously declined,<br/>\nturned invisible, and got it for himself.  As reward, he had offered plat<br/>\nin his initial shout, but like any good samaritan I turned it down.<br/>\nSurprise Athren, you just helped some guild&#39;s blacksmith, how would you<br/>\nlike a banded tunic and arms?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of the story (beyond entertainment) is contained in a passing<br/>\nstatement he made as we continued on to the bank in Erudin.  He said he<br/>\nhad died while lagging out, and that this wasn&#39;t the first time.  In fact,<br/>\nthe time before it he had found his corpse in the very same spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe insight I gleaned from these separate incidents: Zones have a &#39;washing<br/>\nup&#39; point, a sort of shoreline for corpses that are somehow lost in places<br/>\nthat don&#39;t exist, by which I mean somewhere outside the current zone map<br/>\n(swim under the bridge from North Karana to East Karana and you&#39;ll<br/>\nexperience what it&#39;s like to fall outside the world; an excrutiatingly<br/>\nunpleasant feeling, to be sure).  Is this helpful in everyday happenings?<br/>\nNot especially, but I enjoy discovering the proverbial laws of physics as<br/>\nthey apply to this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren, still waiting to hit bottom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
