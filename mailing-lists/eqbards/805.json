Pincer Beetles should be possible for you at level 12.  But, if you<br/>\ncan team up with one good tank and one cleric, you can easily make North<br/>\nKaranas your home for levels 11 through 14.  Excellent for exp, but lousy for<br/>\nloot.  BTW, the beetles are much less trouble for the experience than Griffawns<br/>\n(baby griffs).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hello I am at lvl 12 Wood elf bard.  it seems that I cannot find a good<br/>\n&gt; place for me to solo.  I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it keeps<br/>\n&gt; disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and all the<br/>\n&gt; places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good place to<br/>\n&gt; solo at lvl 12.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanx,<br/>\n&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>\n&gt; Hammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
