Maybe it&#39;s just my<br/>\n&gt;character that&#39;s glitched, but I found that forage and hide are buggy.  I<br/>\n&gt;have never been able to train either of them past their starting values.<br/>\n&gt; As a bard I&#39;m supposed to be able to train forage at 12th level and hide<br/>\n&gt;at 25th level, but they both said I&#39;d reached my maximum limit when I<br/>\n&gt;reached those levels and attempted to train.
