As soon as I get<br/>\ncontrol over my char - I get the &quot;you become&quot; visible msg.  Everytime. This<br/>\nis NOT good when you are gating into CT and are mere lev 26/27.  Also NOT<br/>\ngood when you gate out of CT and Hurd is parked on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez Hurd I wish you would get it through your thick skull: there IS a place<br/>\nin the realm for half elves - damn it! Stop saying there isn&#39;t!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, back to your question, would it work?  Prolly.  Would it be worth it?<br/>\nNot to me.  (brag time) I am now doing most of my serious fighting in my<br/>\nregular group! (damn I love the sound of those words) And we have a cleric!<br/>\nWoo Hoo!  Life rocks now that he is over level 29!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to stay binded at the bank in High Keep. If (or shud I say when) I<br/>\ndie, I have lots of friends to talk to while I mem my spells and my party<br/>\ndoes CR.  Just about the time I am done memming, they call me and say<br/>\n&quot;consent me&quot; so they can drag my corpse to a safe loot spot.  And then that<br/>\nmagic box: &quot;do you want to be revived? yes or no?&quot;  Ohh that is soo nice!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this binding business is fast becoming a distant nightmare.  I guess you<br/>\npay some dues for 29 levels but then there are some nice perks in store for<br/>\nthose who have dome the smart thing:  built a well balanced, regular group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 29th song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, September 30, 1999 3:28 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Bard workaround to binding in evil<br/>\ncities- will this work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHad an idea I wanted to run by you guys.  If it will work,<br/>\nits a possible<br/>\n\t\tway for bards to get bound in evil cities and safely return<br/>\nto their corpse<br/>\n\t\tif they die.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStep 1: Bard has two flutes in his inventory.  One is in a<br/>\ncontainer and<br/>\n\t\tanother in a main inventory slot.<br/>\n\t\tStep 2: Bard groups with someone who can bind and gets bound<br/>\nin an evil city<br/>\n\t\tright next to the zone border.<br/>\n\t\tStep 3: The bard and the person who bound him go into the<br/>\nnext zone, i.e.<br/>\n\t\tInnothule Swamp, Feerot, and duel right next to the zone<br/>\nborder to the evil<br/>\n\t\tcity.  Bard lets the other person kill him in the duel.<br/>\n\t\tStep 4: Bard reappears in evil city, goes to the zone where<br/>\nhe is killed,<br/>\n\t\tand loots everything from his corpse except the flute in the<br/>\nmain inventory.<br/>\n\t\tBard sings invis song, using flute that was in a container,<br/>\nto get past<br/>\n\t\tguards and goes adventuring.<br/>\n\t\tStep 5: If bard dies while adventuring, he can then loot his<br/>\ncorpse to get<br/>\n\t\tthe second flute, sing invis song, and safely get back to<br/>\nhis corpse. <br/>\n\t\tStep 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 to get another corpse<br/>\nwith spare flute.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI have never dueled anyone so am not certain how it works.<br/>\nI assume you<br/>\n\t\tappear at your bind point when you get killed in a duel.  I<br/>\nalso assume your<br/>\n\t\tcorpse remains in place (duration based on your level) as<br/>\nlong as there is<br/>\n\t\tequipment still on it.  This procedure also assumes that the<br/>\nbard doesn&#39;t<br/>\n\t\tget attacked and killed in the evil city while he is waiting<br/>\nto appear (i.e.<br/>\n\t\tduring LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tComments?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t???
