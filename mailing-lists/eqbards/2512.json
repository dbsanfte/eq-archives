My guess would be<br/>\nthat it refers to Pro C, that when a weapon casts a spell it triggers a Pro<br/>\nC routine to do that, hence proc.  Just a guess, could be way off base.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr it could refer to the master enchanter Proc&#39;Daron of S. Ro who is said to<br/>\nhave ivented the embedding spell that allows inanimate objects to cast<br/>\nspells randomly, hence Proc.  I hear the dervishes of that area actually<br/>\nprefer the term Daron.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bob Stewart [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 28, 1999 8:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Hell level?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:34 AM 6/28/99 -0700, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course I couldn&#39;t wait to try out the proc on the Staff of Writhing - <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is &quot;proc?&quot;  Where does the word come from?

Programmers jargon is handy for<br/>\nprogrammers but it leads to less understanding for those who are not.<br/>\nVerant has a bad habit of using such jargon, even in system warnings, with<br/>\nno explanation whatsoever of what it means.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unreasonable and inconsiderate to invent words or give old words new<br/>\nmeaning then expect others to know what they mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the software industry for 30 years.
