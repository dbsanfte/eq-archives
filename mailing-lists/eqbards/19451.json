When someone<br/>\nreposts the issue, I&#39;d prefer it if you could remove the items that we&#39;ve<br/>\ncommented on, or at least indicate its status.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten word on many of the issues from various members of the team:<br/>\n<br/>\nPurity and Vitality are fixed in code. It should be live now. If it isn&#39;t,<br/>\nit is on test and will be live at the next client patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nKellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has it<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech: Fear spells do not cause NPCs to stop<br/>\ncasting. Works as intended. <br/>\n<br/>\nSolidarity of Vision: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohthan&#39;s Provocation: We&#39;ve reduced the fizzle rate and added the message.<br/>\nRemainder works as intended. Changes are live.<br/>\n<br/>\nNiv&#39;s: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Travel: Opinions requested and placed on the board. I believe the<br/>\nconsensus was to remove the invis component, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nLargo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nNillipus&#39;: Works as intended currently. We&#39;re open to removing the damage<br/>\nshield component if you wish. Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Twilight: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssonant Strain: fixed as requested.<br/>\n<br/>\nBombastic Bellow: Fixed and live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>\nstories for future expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kunark Armor&quot;: Well my list says &quot;fixed&quot; but I don&#39;t have what they ment by<br/>\nthat. If any changes have been made they would be live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it for this installment</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
