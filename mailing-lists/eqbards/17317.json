This includes EQ.  <br/>\n&gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup over a TNT2,<br/>\n&gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you see in some<br/>\n&gt; reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why? Because my brother <br/>\nin law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife has the same setup <br/>\nwith a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my GeForce at 1024X768 <br/>\nthat they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There is a HUGE <br/>\nperformance increase that is VERY noticable if you have your <br/>\ncomputers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24 person raid on Kedge <br/>\nKeep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off, same setup on <br/>\nall 3 computers and they were both lagging and had much much lower <br/>\nframe rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at 1024x768 as I <br/>\nwould have been had I been the only one in the zone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
