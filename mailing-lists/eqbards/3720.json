Partied with my friends I have ALOT of fun but<br/>\nI rarely get much of the experience from any given series of kills... which<br/>\nonly gets worse because they keep getting farther and farther ahead of me...<br/>\nand since 12th level I&#39;ve been virtually incapable of soloing much of<br/>\nanything that gives me experience without getting my butt killed.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nplaying this game since the first week it went public, and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>\nmy bard since the very day that the Bristlebane server opened... and she is<br/>\nonly 16th level.. about two bubbles from 17th.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... anyone have any ideas?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
