I&#39;ve heard from Beta friends that this particular <br/>\n&gt; double standard<br/>\n&gt; was implemented back in beta because some spellcasters were levitating<br/>\n&gt; themselves, running off the nearest cliff, and shelling mobs <br/>\n&gt; with direct<br/>\n&gt; damage spells from what effectively constituted as a &#39;safe <br/>\n&gt; zone&#39;. To fix<br/>\n&gt; this they enabled mobs to attack you across any vertical distance.<br/>\n&gt; \tI suppose there could be two additional solutions to <br/>\n&gt; correct this<br/>\n&gt; inconsistency.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t1. Disallow casting when levitated. Nah. That would <br/>\n&gt; totally screw over<br/>\n&gt; casters in the plane of Air as I understand it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t2. Allow players to attack mobs across any vertical <br/>\n&gt; distance. Possible,<br/>\n&gt; even if it is not really realistic. Imagine a warrior on the ground<br/>\n&gt; underneath the Aviak Village in South Karana hitting aviaks up in the<br/>\n&gt; highest building. =/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tGood Journey,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; 8)From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; 8)[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; 8)Sent: Thursday, July 15, 1999 11:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; 8)To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; 8)Subject: RE: [eqbards] More OT stuff: Invisibility<br/>\n&gt; 8)<br/>\n&gt; 8)<br/>\n&gt; 8)From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8)<br/>\n&gt; 8)You should be able to.
