My other toon is a mage(20th Level) and he is now in <br/>\n  &gt; OOT soloing gargoyles. Can I do the same with my bard or will <br/>\n  &gt; the gargoyles rip me a new one?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;toon&quot;? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m really only comfortable answering this question as I have a lot of<br/>\n  experience with the gargs out here. I was able to solo gargs at 23rd level<br/>\n  using the all instrument attack (DDD,COD,Hymn). The tougher gargs, however,<br/>\n  I ended up kicking in selo&#39;s and weaving in bellow & hymn while running<br/>\n  circles on one side of the island (safe fall will come in real handy out<br/>\n  here when you get it). It&#39;s a little dangerous running circles as you can<br/>\n  also pick up other gargs. I&#39;ve pulled other gargs by accident and I survived<br/>\n  by just doing the same thing, selo&#39;s, bellow, hymn (and an occasional jig as<br/>\n  your stamina gets real low).<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can also run around the perimeter of the island, but beware of people<br/>\n  fighting spectres. Also, I fight in 3rd person view so it was a pain<br/>\n  switching views as the island gets in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So you might be able to solo gargs at level 20, but you&#39;ll most likely end<br/>\n  up having to spend a lot of time running and bellowing towards the end of<br/>\n  the fights.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
