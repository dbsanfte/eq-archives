Druids, Necros, Warriors, Clerics... most of these<br/>\nclasses you can have a fairly low attention level.  You may think I&#39;m crazy<br/>\nbut say you&#39;re soloing a Necro... you kill kill kill for 5 mins and then med<br/>\nfor 10, allowing you to afk, watch tv, knit, etc.  Clerics in a big raid<br/>\nbuff and heal ... all they have to do is keep an eye out for their party<br/>\nmembers health - think about how most clerics say their class is &quot;boring as<br/>\nhell.&quot;  Warriors, hit auto attack, and taunt and kick now and then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow of course on a big/important raid everyone is gonna pay attention.  And<br/>\nANY class where you are alert you will play better/use the class to its<br/>\nfullest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBards though, you have to be THERE all the time, not lost in tells, not half<br/>\nafk, not watching tv.. or things get nasty fast.  This is why i think people<br/>\nburn out on bards quickly in general.  In my opinion the bard class is<br/>\npretty evenly balanced - prolly not perfect but nothing is... but you have<br/>\nto be ATTENTIVE to play it even semi-well... and as time goes by in EQ, I<br/>\nnotice more and more people lacking attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that sort of makes sense :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 59th Shammy<br/>\nTani, 47th Bardette<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 8:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a bard friend that just restarted on a new server.  <br/>\n&gt; She is spending<br/>\n&gt; her days quad kiting and she is only 20th lvl...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 6:30 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hehe if we&#39;re so overpowered why is it there&#39;s only 2 bards <br/>\n&gt; in my guild<br/>\n&gt; above 30? being me at 50 and another at 56?  Sure we have a <br/>\n&gt; couple twinks in<br/>\n&gt; the teens and 20&#39;s but that&#39;s just that, a twink... Well one <br/>\n&gt; of em might be<br/>\n&gt; leveling up to 50+ since his necro is 60. If we&#39;d be so <br/>\n&gt; overpowered the<br/>\n&gt; populations would be like that of a druid or necro soloers...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin 50 bard<br/>\n&gt; RIP<br/>\n&gt; Ayonae Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: February 26, 2001 3:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are <br/>\n&gt; overpowered.  The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>\n&gt; were true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level advancement <br/>\n&gt; and ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the flat <br/>\n&gt; (100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>\n&gt; great secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards <br/>\n&gt; can do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>\n&gt; bard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>\n&gt; more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>\n&gt; taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>\n&gt; of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>\n&gt; comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>\n&gt; well.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>\n&gt; playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>\n&gt; different comparisons, really.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>\n&gt; with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>\n&gt; fruits.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkfox<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
