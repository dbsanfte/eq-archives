I just lost a fine steel spear,<br/>\nwhich I spent most of my bank account on (money isn&#39;t exactly prolific<br/>\nat level 8).  Tried to shout and see if someone would return it, but<br/>\nalas to no avail.  Yes I&#39;m using the inventory-as-hotkey method.  I<br/>\nhave no problem juggling 2-3 songs, but trying to switch instruments<br/>\nis a serious PITA with the risk of dropping something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarren, aka Erol of Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
