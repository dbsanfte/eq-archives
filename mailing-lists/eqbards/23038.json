From my personal experience I would estimate<br/>\nthere is up to a 20% xp bonus in some dungeons.  (FYI the ones that seemd to<br/>\nhave the highest modifier to me are Unrest, Mistmoore, Dalinars and Kaesora.<br/>\nGuk gets an honorable mention because I think the mobs there are very weak<br/>\nfor their level, thus yield good xp despite the zone bonus seeming not as<br/>\ngood)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lvl 31, in a 5 hour night in Dalinars, I have gotten 6 bubs of xp! (Group<br/>\nsize was 4-6 people)  Was it a freak occurence?  Nope, got a little more<br/>\nthan 5 the next week (in the same 5 hour span)..  Both nights, every person<br/>\nin our group dinged (not all were there all the time), it was pretty<br/>\namazing.  They tried out Nurga this week without me, I&#39;ll see next week how<br/>\ngood it is...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
