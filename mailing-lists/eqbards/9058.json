The reason bards seem to be in<br/>\na lot of these situations is because they&#39;re usually constantly buffing<br/>\neveryone all the time.  For an experiment, pull something w/o singing any<br/>\nsongs.  Have any nearby caster buff anyone in the party just as the MOB is<br/>\ncoming into range.  Chances are the MOB will bee-line towards the caster (I<br/>\njust saw this multiple times lastnight when a druid would buff damage<br/>\nshields at the beginning of a pull - the MOB invariably went straight at the<br/>\ndruid)<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 (still) Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
