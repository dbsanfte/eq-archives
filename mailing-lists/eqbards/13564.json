And in a way that only<br/>\nVerant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>\nthe same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>\nstop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>\nthan 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>\nicons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>\nadventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>\n&#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>\nwhatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>\n20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>\nwill be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>\ndifferent from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>\nhave new tactics.
