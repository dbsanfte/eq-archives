Maybe another one out the back side of<br/>\nOgook or something.  Anyway in this new zone would be a boat dock to take<br/>\npeople to the new lands.<br/>\nIf you were in a mixed group, people using old and new versions, everyone<br/>\nwould hit the zone entrance and recieve the Loading Please Wait message.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose with the New updated versions would successfully zone into the dock<br/>\nand be able to cross to the new lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose with the older versions would zone back to the main zone and recieve<br/>\na message saying.  Sorry you must purchase the Everquest Upgrade pack to<br/>\ngain entrance to this zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that the group is split it would show a dark red bar of health for all<br/>\nthose that were not in your zone.  Communication should still be possible<br/>\nsince that dosen&#39;t require new monsters or zone graphics.

My _suspicion_ is that they&#39;ll either have new servers available<br/>\n&gt;(requiring a new character) or they&#39;ll have a port for your existing<br/>\n&gt;characters to the new game environment.

This mean that there will be people I am<br/>\n&gt;playing with that don&#39;t have it, right? Now what does this mean? I am<br/>\n&gt;pretty certain that Verant spoke about adding new creatures, and<br/>\n&gt;possibly races, and who knows what else (spells, items). All of this on<br/>\n&gt;top of the more than likely two new continents. How is this going to<br/>\n&gt;affect the gameplay? What if I, playing with the expansion pack, and<br/>\n&gt;partied with someone without?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess there really isn&#39;t an issue as long as the expansion doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;add new races. All of the new zones, creatures, etc could be kept to<br/>\n&gt;the new continents. But what about the boat to get there? Would someone<br/>\n&gt;without the expansion not see it? Would they be magically barred from<br/>\n&gt;entering it? I&#39;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it<br/>\n&gt;will all work great when it comes out, but these are questions that I<br/>\n&gt;will have nonetheless until then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mandibal<br/>\n&gt;Travelling Trouvere<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
