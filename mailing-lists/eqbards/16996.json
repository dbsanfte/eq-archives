I&#39;ve <br/>\nturned down one previous offer because the site looked like crud, and had <br/>\nnothing to offer in return.  This one, however, is offering to build a <br/>\ndatabase to house the glossary (making updates Ooooh so easy), at the cost <br/>\nof losing my banners.  While this may seem like a no-brainer (especially <br/>\nconsidering I make NO money from the banners I&#39;m currently hosting), they <br/>\nare for friends of mine, and I&#39;d hate to lose even this piddling little <br/>\nadvertising for them.  Unfortunately, Everlore is very strict :P  No <br/>\nbanners from outside sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read the contract yet - waiting on a reply about that now.  But I <br/>\nam really ambivalent about this (I *knew* I&#39;d find a way to use that word <br/>\nthis week ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my dilemma - and I&#39;m not saying that you guys are going to solve <br/>\nit for me - I just need some unbiased input here - Do I take the Lady or <br/>\nthe Tiger?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
