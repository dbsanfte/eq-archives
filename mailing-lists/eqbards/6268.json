Dex or <br/>\n&gt;      Agility?  The manuals are rather vague on this.  Anyone done any <br/>\n&gt;      testing?  Empirical evidence?  I have been mostly collecting Agility <br/>\n&gt;      items based on messages I read in the past.  I personally have not <br/>\n&gt;      noticed much effect with dex items even though I have a couple.  I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;      spent a lot of money (bard money) on agility items and I hope I <br/>\n&gt;      haven&#39;t wasted it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t done any formal tests, but I&#39;ve played a lot with items for<br/>\nboth dex and agility and so has a L50 ranger friend of mine, and neither<br/>\nof us can detect (empiriacally) a lot of difference between having 101<br/>\nagility and 150 agility. Agility seems to only control how often the mob<br/>\nmisses you. Dex on the other hand seems to control success at hitting,<br/>\nsuccessful procing of weapons and successful triggering of things like<br/>\ndual weild, or in a ranger&#39;s case, parry and riposte as well. I had been<br/>\nmainly concentrating on building up dex and agility, wearing things like<br/>\n2 serpentine bracers. I think I will be replacing one with something<br/>\nthat adds more AC, as AC itself at least reduces the damage you take.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people claim adding agi+ items ups AC more but my experience with a<br/>\nserpentine bracer (AC1 AGI9 I think) is that it adds less AC than a<br/>\nplain rubicite bracer (can&#39;t remember AC)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
