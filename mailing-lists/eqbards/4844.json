But it also<br/>\nhas the orc legionere from Innoruuk (or what ever is the equivilent of<br/>\nHell).  I happened by there and healed up a dwarf who was in his 20&#39;s - 25<br/>\nor 27.  He says he just solo the orc leg and got xp.  Then he whacked him<br/>\nagain.  Turns out he was a cleric and he says I can kill this orc. You gotta<br/>\nbe kidding I say - I was like 18.  He says he&#39;ll fetch him out and heal me.<br/>\nWow that was fun!  (Just got under the xp cap for high level mobs I guess -<br/>\ncuz I got xp we were not grouped and he healed me while I melee&#39;d.)  So if<br/>\nyou hunt that camp - it was like mid zone - have a good strong party ready<br/>\nfor the lege.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good bandit camp in lesser fay is the Nybright Sisters.  They drop<br/>\nprecious gems pretty often and also supply necklaces for a kelethin quest -<br/>\ntalk to the drunk - whoever he is.  But you will prolly need help and it can<br/>\nbe a busy campsite. They were easy kills when I was 18 and I got xp from a<br/>\ncouple of them.  I also had to endure whines from other campers - who did<br/>\nnot want to share with me. Any how the camp is by the zone wall way down<br/>\nnear the Mist Moore tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n But the more fun thing to get in lesser fay is Crookstinger!  He is a named<br/>\ngiant wasp and if you can find him he drops a nice magic dagger - with a<br/>\npoison effect.  Well, its nice for his level - which I&#39;d guess around 10 to<br/>\n12.  I was just wandering down a path and see my text scrolling<br/>\n&quot;Crookstinger stings you for dmg 8&quot;  Wtf?? Crookstinger? I get ready to run<br/>\nthen con him green. Ohh, theeee Crookstinger!

That<br/>\n\t\t&gt; was the point at which I decided to leave the homeland of<br/>\nKelethin and<br/>\n\t\t&gt; Crushbone and start exploring.  Lots of stuff out there to<br/>\nfight at that<br/>\n\t\t&gt; level range, both in groups or solo.  I recommend doing<br/>\nthe bard mail<br/>\n\t\t&gt; delivery quests and explore some on the side.
