Only a couple things to mention...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. Put the location to buy song as a key on the main list eg: Q,K or E or<br/>\n&gt;HK.  I keep a chart like the main one handy for the frequent tells:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;yungbard: excuse me m&#39;lady can you tell me where to buy my 14th song?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;sylly: sure but first just call me sylly!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;looks on handy dandy chart<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;sylly: ahh yes you can get Lyssa&#39;s Libbertto in Erudin - look for the round<br/>\n&gt;building kinda in center of town or ask someone to take you to the library <br/>\n&gt;-<br/>\n&gt;there is no name on the building<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;feels like she impressed someone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;yungbard: ahh thank you m&#39;lady<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will try and do that later this week, good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. It&#39;s prolly just me but I dont care for dark backgrounds. Ok, that one<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t count.  It printed quite well for a web page - did you do something<br/>\n&gt;special to make page break correctly?  If you have page controls for<br/>\n&gt;printing, I would suggest having fewer songs on the first page and making<br/>\n&gt;the abbreviation key a &quot;footer&quot; so it repeats on both pages.  I keep my<br/>\n&gt;sheet in a plastic cover right next to my keyboard and refer to it alot.<br/>\n&gt;Having the key on both sides would be handy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You give me credit for knowledge I do not possess :p  I just made a table <br/>\nand let FP2000 take care of the rest, lol.  I will check with my friend who <br/>\nis a web designer on how to make it a footer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All in all - it looks really great!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks a bunch Rokenn!!! (and John too as i imagine this is part of your<br/>\n&gt;joint effort? or is his ananysis coming later?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will be posting John&#39;s insights as soon as he sends them to me (nudge, <br/>\nnudge)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
