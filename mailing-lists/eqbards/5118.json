We seem to have an\r<br/>\ninteresting dynamic going here.  We have on one side (although sides imply\r<br/>\nconflict I am not aluding to just to be clear) Those who believe that the \r<br/>\nbard has issues that should be addressed.  Then on another we have those\r<br/>\nthat believe the bard has problems but don&#39;t want to be viewed as complainers.\r<br/>\nand then from what I see we have the final groupd which say the bard is fine\r<br/>\nas is nothing is wrong enough to bother with after we don&#39;t Want UO tank mages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat I find interesting about this is that it SEEMS the majority agree that\r<br/>\nwhile we LOVE our bards there are problems.  Let me say that I too fit in the catagory of those who feel that there are problems with our beloved class.\r<br/>\nI do not however exactly know what should be done.  I personally feel that\r<br/>\nthe issues in some cases are severe and should be acted on.  Does that require\r<br/>\na petition I don&#39;t know.  I have some concerns about that though which I will \r<br/>\nexplain a bit later.  The z-axis need to be fixed period.  The level 14 Lore song needs to have a purpose or needs to be replaced period.  We simply do not have enough going for us to make pointless songs acceptable.  These sudden missed notes gotta go too.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFYI the suggestion about agil or dex having to do with missed notes.. well with\r<br/>\nmy current enhanced stats are 99dex 106 agl and my missed notes is also 10-20 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is far too much &quot;it&#39;s for game balance&quot; cheerleaders out there I think too.  The Bard should not be master of all things nor should the Bard be inept at all things. The skill caps were set far to low, and there really is no reason\r<br/>\nfor it.  More to the point there is no reason for us to accept the messing of our class to be &quot;more&quot; fair to clerics wizes etc when they can used items such as the mask of the deceiver by holding it.. when it was meant to be bard/rogue only.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLet there be no mistake that I love my bard.. but that does not mean that we have not been taken advantage of for our silence over such matters.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo explain my ealier comment supporting the pettition as perhaps being needed,\r<br/>\nI have found Verant lacking majorly in the response department.  I discovered\r<br/>\nmuch to my misfortune a &quot;hole&quot; in the zone of dagnors cauldron on the povar server.  After muliple petittions and feedbacks to GM&#39;s to this day no one\r<br/>\nhas contacted me or any of those who tried to help me that night about it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe hole if you are curious is toward the zone exit to BB there is a curve in the zone wall and a boulder infront of it, if you were to idle out you would\r<br/>\nrun up the wall and fall into the crevice between the boulder and the zone wall.\r<br/>\nonly those who can fly have a chance of getting out.. it took alot of teamwork \r<br/>\nand 3 hours of my clan&#39;s time to get me out of that whole the entire time there\r<br/>\nwas no contact from any GM,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
