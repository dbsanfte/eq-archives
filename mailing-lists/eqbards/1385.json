The four I keep are my group combat buff, Hymn, Selo&#39;s and<br/>\nBellow.  Those are my most twistable songs, I&#39;ve found.  On my other banks<br/>\nI have things like Run, Sit, Camp, /Corpse,  and other handy dandies.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re wondering why those are on there, it&#39;s because I play full-screen,<br/>\nand don&#39;t have the key-bank on the right side.  I like the increased<br/>\nvisibility the full-screen model gives me.  Plus it makes the game seem<br/>\nmore immersive.<br/>\nPersonally, if you already have your bank set up in a way that works, then<br/>\ndon&#39;t bother with the /assist key - just remember /ass - and you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
