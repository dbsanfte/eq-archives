I remember 26th level as being  a &quot;hell&quot; level for me.<br/>\nI was hanging out in MM a lot trying to get a gypsy lute for quite a long<br/>\ntime.  I lost count of the times I died at 26th level in MM.  What I do<br/>\nremember is that when I died to yellow and red mobs, it didn&#39;t seem like I<br/>\nlost too much EXP (maybe 1/4 bub).  But if I died to a blue or green mob,<br/>\nthen I lost a lot more EXP (maybe 1/2 bub).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the case, then it appears that the game may be coded to lessen<br/>\nthe penalty for dying when you are taking more risks (fighting yellow and<br/>\nreds) versus playing it safe (fighting blues).<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Remember it takes 2-4 times the exp in the hell level.  You are losing<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same amount of exp, just looks like less because of the amount it takes<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gain a level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, that&#39;s exactly what my expierence disproves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I was level 30, I lost about a quarter bubble per death.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I reached 31, then died without having gained any experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I lost a bit more than a half bubble into 30.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That means a L30 death costs 0.25 L30 bubbles, but a L31 death<br/>\n&gt; costs 0.6 L30 bubbles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hit 47 last night, then died without having gained any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience in it.  I lost &quot;only&quot; a bit more than a half bubble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into 46.  My friends who&#39;ve died at 46 all said they lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 bubble per death in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That means a L46 death costs 1.25 L46 bubbles, but a L47 death<br/>\n&gt; costs 0.6 L46 bubbles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clearly the amount of experience you lose in (hell levels+1)<br/>\n&gt; is greater than the amount you lose in hell levels, or in<br/>\n&gt; (hell levels+2).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
