I can almost always<br/>\njuggle 3 songs (mind you, I don&#39;t always do it, tho I should...but it&#39;s<br/>\ndoable for me.) It could be the view I&#39;m using; I play in the first view in<br/>\n800x600 res, and although I do get slowdowns with high particle density,<br/>\nsetting it to low means I still see root and get almost no lag even with 3-4<br/>\n24&#39;s in my group (I&#39;m usually the low level...Unrest is a cool if deadly<br/>\nplace to be if you&#39;re inside the house, but it&#39;s no fun outside.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the hot buttons, I like to keep my 3 most heavily rotated songs and my<br/>\nattack key in the first box (for obvious reasons), along with Forage and<br/>\nSense Heading (I suppose this could be changed to Loc and Assist, too.) My<br/>\nsecond box has another Attack on top, then a Loc, then the six slots I use<br/>\nfor my inventory- the two melee weapons on top, and the four bottom<br/>\ninventory slots on the bottom. The first three of these hold instruments,<br/>\nthe fourth is empty (this is why the mino horn doubling as brass and wind is<br/>\nsoooooo important- I can switch to an instrument in 3 mouse clicks because I<br/>\nhave an empty space left to put the weapon in.) The third and fourth have<br/>\nvarious utility commands for when I&#39;m in the second view and don&#39;t want to<br/>\nswitch back, and the last two boxes are so far empty. Try that, especially<br/>\nthe inventory thing- I have never dropped an item needlessly since I started<br/>\nusing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbbalar, L20 bard, Fennin Ro (mostly retired...switching to racewar when it<br/>\ncomes out)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 6 Jul 1999 13:32:23 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Quick Keys/Songs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 6 Jul 1999, Brendan Daly wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The advantage is in twisting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells due to screen saturation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>\n&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>\n&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>\n&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>\n&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>\n&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>\n&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\n&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>\n&gt; side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>\n&gt; completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>\n&gt; a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>\n&gt; un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>\n&gt; system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>\n&gt; of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>\n&gt; the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>\n&gt; delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
