All nurtured life<br/>\nplanted by interloping Gods.<br/>\n  Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws, turned her back<br/>\non Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws.<br/>\n  The Crystalline Dragon content in her lair, Sealed off Sky and still<br/>\nslumbers there.<br/>\n  Some dragons went mad, apart from their queen, Others took charge and<br/>\nformed a wurm ring.<br/>\n  The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks, To dwell in the lands<br/>\ninhabited by the weak.<br/>\n  One of these rebels a lady white as snow, Swept up a shard of nature<br/>\nunknown.<br/>\n  As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell, Into a deep slumber from<br/>\nwhat no one could tell.<br/>\n  Their magic had faded, because of the shard? Or perhaps from the magic<br/>\nthey call Veeshans Veil.<br/>\n  Now a new verse to this legend Ill share. In regards to the Sky and what<br/>\nis happening there.<br/>\n  Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin, The Wurm Queen neglect<br/>\nwakes her children again.<br/>\n  My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse for the<br/>\nspeak the truth. Mortals now visit where Veeshan slumbers, and only dragons<br/>\nonce dwelled.<br/>\n  A drake puffs its chest with pride.<br/>\n  But the door to the Sky is not a one way portal. There is much to learn<br/>\nfrom the great Wurms, and much to fear.<br/>\n  Sainy bows.<br/>\n  Come my friend it is time to move on.<br/>\n  A drake purrs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa!
