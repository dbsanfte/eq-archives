And that if they are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; true newbies worrying about that!)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;By &quot;true newbie&quot; I assume you mean non-twinks, since a non-twinked<br/>\n&gt;secondary character will need to count their coppers as much as a primary<br/>\n&gt;character at the lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, by &quot;True newbie&quot; I meant at levels 1-15 or so. About the point<br/>\nwhen you start getting enough loot between trips back to town (And you&#39;re<br/>\nfar enough away from town) That you destroy coppers to save the weight and<br/>\nkeep you light on your feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwinked or not, ALL my characters save every copper they can get -- until<br/>\nthey run out of strength to carry it.
