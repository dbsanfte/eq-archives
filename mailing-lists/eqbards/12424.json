A lot of people, especially the shamans, are really disgusted if<br/>\neverything Abashi stated was true.  To sum up what he said in very general<br/>\nterms, DEX and AGI have no impact whatsoever on combat skills like dodge,<br/>\nblock, riposte, and parry.  DEX has no impact on improving your chance to<br/>\nget a successful hit.  There was more to his post but DEX and AGI I think<br/>\nare the two stats everyone was primarily complaining about.  One person even<br/>\nposted that for the melee classes, since stats are almost meaningless, EQ is<br/>\nmore a first person shooter than a RPG.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf its true that primary stats don&#39;t really affect combat skills that much,<br/>\nI wonder how important resist rates are?  I would really hate to find out<br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t important in successfully making a resistance roll as we<br/>\nthink they are.  Black helicopter sighting here:  the other night I was in<br/>\nMistmoore and my party decided to pull a negotiator that was wandering.  I<br/>\nequipped drum and weaved both elemental and guardian rhythms.  That raised<br/>\nmy magic resist rate to well over 100.  Myself and three other people in my<br/>\nparty still got charmed by the negotiator.  I had told everyone beforehand<br/>\nthat I would have both songs up for the entire fight so none of us were<br/>\nlikely to get charmed.  To say the least I wasn&#39;t the most popular person in<br/>\nthe group after that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; According to Abashi and reported by EQCasters, stats affect your chances<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; raising your skill level in skills.  Agility increases the chance of<br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; a skill raise in dodge is a listed example.  This would seem to greatly<br/>\n&gt; downplay the value of stats once you hit your skill cap in many areas<br/>\n&gt; sadly.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
