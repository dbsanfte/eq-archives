It was nifty<br/>\nto have him beat on Vox a bit in between trying to pound me into the ground.<br/>\nI was in melee range most of the time of him and Vox, due to the press of<br/>\nplayers and corpses. Vox got pulled into the hallway by accident and the IG<br/>\nshowed up halfway thru the battle. I recharmed him repeatedly, didn&#39;t have<br/>\nanything special in the way of charisma either, and didn&#39;t get many resists.<br/>\nProbably was just the way my luck was that night though. I managed to live<br/>\nthru the whole fight even though the group tanks were among the first to go<br/>\ndown. It was a messy run, partly due to being a second or maybe third<br/>\nattempt with staggered IG respawns and whatnot. We triumphed in the end, and<br/>\nnothing good at all dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\n/em hobbles back over to her rocker.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGranny Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
