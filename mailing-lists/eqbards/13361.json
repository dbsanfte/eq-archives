In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-205191175\">I can back this up as well with 100% certainty.  Over the past couple of<br/>\nmonths, the only casters who have died in groups I was with were both<br/>\nenchanters.  In both situations, my party got a very bad pull, the<br/>\nenchanters did AE mez and ended up dying because they didn&#39;t keep the mobs<br/>\nmezzed (bad move on the enchanters part) and the tanks couldn&#39;t taunt the<br/>\nmobs off of them when they broke out of the mez.  Not once has any other<br/>\ncaster class died.  I don&#39;t even keep count now of the number of times I die<br/>\nper level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Even if casters die more than bards (which is debatable), the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;problem is that when casters die it&#39;s usually due to their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stupidity.  When bards die, it&#39;s usually due to someone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stupidity.  I think I am just fine without bind, but you won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;see much opposition from me to getting bind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can say for a certainty that caster&#39;s at least in my guild do not die<br/>\n&gt; anywhere near as much as other classes.  We have had 3 caster deaths that<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; know of in the last 3 months.  I alone have died twice that many times.<br/>\n&gt; Another bard in our guild died three times in one night due to stupid<br/>\n&gt; groupmates.  I was luckier and only died twice due to the same groupmates.<br/>\n&gt; One of our casters hasn&#39;t died in 5 levels.  He has only died 4 times in<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; entire career up to around level 24. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
