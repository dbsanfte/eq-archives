I also thought your<br/>\ncomment was you were having trouble charming blues. We rarely have an<br/>\nenchanter so if the pull is too many, I use charm to deal with spares. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot disputing you, I just found it odd that I didn&#39;t have the smae<br/>\nimpression with my bard.<br/>\n Lullaby I never mem, unless we are bailing out someone in an area so green<br/>\nthe resists don&#39;t matter,i.e. &quot;Frogluk hits you for 1 point of damage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGediprime (who finally got to 32), and I were talking about Mana song this<br/>\nweek. It does change a bard&#39;s life. You can just sing mana for most groups<br/>\nand they could care less about anything else. I am frequently afk and no one<br/>\nnotices, unless the monk overpulls, hehe. If we have a druid, I don&#39;t chain<br/>\nunless he&#39;s oom, so that leaves me with little to do besides battle song<br/>\nduring fights when the casters have mana and charm if we have more than we<br/>\nwant at once. Charm makes a decent taunt for me, even on a resist. These<br/>\ndays, I&#39;m usually doing laundry or cooking while playing; my partner yells<br/>\nfor me if the group gets into a bad fix and he can&#39;t drive both the bard and<br/>\nthe cleric effectively. I felt a bit better when he told me it was easier to<br/>\nplay my wizard with his characters than my bard.<br/>\nI wonder if Verant is afraid to tinker with Lullaby, or has some mental<br/>\nscars about that song. Way back when, Lullaby let you kill things without<br/>\ngetting a blow in return. That got nerfed, and rightly so. Of course they<br/>\nalso nerfed our speed about that same time. Maybe they have a mental block<br/>\nabout what we see as the problems with lullaby. I&#39;d consider loaning my bard<br/>\nto a bonafide Verant Tester, if I thought it would show them what we all<br/>\nsee. You&#39;d think they would have the ability (and the smarts) to test any<br/>\nlevel range character though.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t quit playing but I play much less these days and my bigger focus<br/>\nis getting my wiz to 34 so she can tp.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
