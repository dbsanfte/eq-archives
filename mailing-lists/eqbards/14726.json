Nope. It was only loaded<br/>\nbecause I&#39;d been using it in the Cazic CY with a all melee group earlier<br/>\nthat day and had forgot to swap it out.

Selo&#39;s + Screech.  The shadowmen move so fast in the<br/>\n&gt;   opposite direction that they are out of agro radius within about<br/>\n&gt;   2 seconds and give up the chase.  So if someone asks you if you<br/>\n&gt;   can outrun shadowmen, you can if you are creative.  Just twist<br/>\n&gt;   Selos and Screech and take off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good idea. Didn&#39;t someone on the list say they used Selo&#39;s and Lullaby<br/>\nonce for a similar trick?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
