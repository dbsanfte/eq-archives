So everyone<br/>\n&gt; gets on the tormented dead, thus waking it up, and it<br/>\n&gt; remembers that it REALLY doesn&#39;t like me. Now I&#39;m at half<br/>\n&gt; health and tanking a tormented dead full-time since he<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t sleep. Our druid heals me a few times but he is very<br/>\n&gt; soon OOM due to burning the ghoul. The ranger healed me<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; course, the beetles not only totally hated me for putting<br/>\n&gt; them to sleep, but they also were getting worked up cuz<br/>\n&gt; they smelled a kill. And they got it, I was killed by a<br/>\n&gt; green beetle. :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WHAT I LEARNED: Hmmm... I&#39;m not sure. I guess the idea<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you play Lullaby, you will be doing most of the tanking<br/>\nwhether or not you want to.  Make sure the healer(s) in your<br/>\ngroup are capable of healing all the damage you will take.  If<br/>\nthey can&#39;t, don&#39;t even bother trying to use it - just run for<br/>\nthe zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll take you a while (and many deaths) to figure out just<br/>\nwhat trains you can and can&#39;t handle with the song, but it&#39;s<br/>\nwell worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; situation would have been to have the ghoul hitting on the<br/>\n&gt; ranger, and the druid healing me while I slept the other<br/>\n&gt; mobs. The only problem with that would be that this means<br/>\n&gt; the ranger is basically soloing the ghoul... but I think<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to equip a lute to use the song, though it<br/>\nhelps.  You can equip your weapons and help with the fight.  <br/>\nThe ranger should&#39;ve taunted to try to get the ghoul off you,<br/>\nthus taking some damage and saving the druid from having to<br/>\nnuke so hard.  Whether or not the druid should&#39;ve helped with<br/>\nthe tormented or meditated back mana, I can&#39;t say since I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know much damage you were taking or now effective the<br/>\ndruid&#39;s heals were.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Accelerando is much faster with a drum.  Around level 20<br/>\nI think, it becomes fast enough that you can walk faster than<br/>\nmost things can run.  Even before then, the extra speed can be<br/>\nthe difference between life and death.  If you ever find<br/>\nyourself in a situation where you might have to run at less<br/>\nthan 33% health (the point where you start to move slower),<br/>\nequip your drum as you&#39;re starting Accelerando.  I have pulled<br/>\nfriends with less than a quarter bubble of health and a half<br/>\ndozen mobs on them from the house to the zone in Unrest simply<br/>\nby using my drum.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; DEATH #3: So I go back to get my corpse, and as I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; looting some guy trains like four yard trash onto us,<br/>\n&gt; which, for whatever reason, all frenzy on me and kill me<br/>\n&gt; almost instantly. I still had almost a full bar of health<br/>\n&gt; when I was looking down at my corpse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WHAT I LEARNED: Man, life sucks!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen looting your body, the first thing you should loot is<br/>\nyour drum (pre-19) or your flute (19+).  Then you stop looting<br/>\n(you can hit esc to do this quickly), start up Accelerando or<br/>\ninvisibility, and continue looting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
