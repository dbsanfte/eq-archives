If you are unable to deal with<br/>\nany sort of criticism - I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO believe that we are arrogant and never consider markets outside our<br/>\nown.  Almost every article I&#39;ve read talks about EQ being the &quot;Largest&quot;<br/>\nMMORPG Game.  It&#39;s not.  There&#39;s a Korean game that&#39;s larger.  It&#39;s much<br/>\nlarger.   Whether their number is 2.7 million as they claim - or something<br/>\nclose to 800K (not sure - as Tallies show they use some voodoo accounting to<br/>\nget that number) - only looking at the American market when talking about<br/>\n&quot;The Largest&quot; or &quot;Best&quot; is a failing that we&#39;d be better off if we expanded<br/>\nor viewpoint.  The future of the world is global and it&#39;s time to start<br/>\nlooking at it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t post any more on this subject as it is getting OT...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christopher Sanders [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 08, 2002 11:16 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] OT: *sigh* Stereotyping...<br/>\n<br/>\nStereotyping of Americans is no better than American arrogance, real or<br/>\nperceived...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread is now dead to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 08, 2002 11:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Leaving EQ for Competitors?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n  In typical American<br/>\narrogance - we talk about EQ being the biggest because we only look at our<br/>\nmarket But their BloodPledge game has 2.7 million subscribers.
