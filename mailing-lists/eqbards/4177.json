I had<br/>\nabout a dozen critters, including Corflunk, bouncing back and<br/>\nforth.  Newbies in the area were running to me to when they<br/>\nstarted to lose a fight - they&#39;d get a chance to heal up, and<br/>\nunlike the guards, I wouldn&#39;t steal their kills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best though was when I used it on Dorn.  He resisted it<br/>\nlike 5 times (and he&#39;s green go figure), but it finally took<br/>\nand I was rewarded with the message:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dorn flees in terror!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing that was worth every minute of the time it took to get<br/>\nto 26. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n27 is even MORE fun.  You get to make the dark elf guards<br/>\nfight each other.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
