So these ornate boxes would<br/>\nbe loot on mobs?  And only a rogue/bard can open them?  Or would it be more<br/>\naccurate to say only a rogue or bard can open them safely?  And if anyone<br/>\ncan open them, but risks being  poisoned/stabbed/zapped/turned into a<br/>\nnewt/etc then would someone with invulernabilty or high poison/magic resists<br/>\nbe able to escape harm?  Also, could players carry these around like<br/>\nbackpacks for their loot?  (yeah, I know, wicked heavy for such use.  But<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking in terms protecting valuables on PvP servers)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I like this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, unusually chatty bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi suggested:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The idea is fairly simple. Start off by making an item called <br/>\n&gt; An Ornate Box.<br/>\n&gt; If you examine it it appears to be a container with 4 slots <br/>\n&gt; that weighs 5.0<br/>\n&gt; lbs. If you click on it to open it however instead of opening <br/>\n&gt; it casts a<br/>\n&gt; spell like a magic item. The spell is cast on the holder of <br/>\n&gt; the item and<br/>\n&gt; could be a poison DoT, a lightning DD, or whatever trap you like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The change to Disarm traps would be to allow the item to make <br/>\n&gt; a check on<br/>\n&gt; Disarm Traps when attempting to open it. If the skill check <br/>\n&gt; is a success<br/>\n&gt; then the trapped chest is replaced with a different item that <br/>\n&gt; represents the<br/>\n&gt; treasure inside, much in the fashion of the Combine button <br/>\n&gt; changing the item<br/>\n&gt; combined into a new one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This should be a feasible solution to making Disarm Traps <br/>\n&gt; useful, and would<br/>\n&gt; no doubt greatly increase the call for rogues since only they <br/>\n&gt; and high level<br/>\n&gt; bards could open these mysterious treasure boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
