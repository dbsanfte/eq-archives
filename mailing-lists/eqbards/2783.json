I completed the string quest at the <br/>\nqeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits and a litle bit <br/>\nof exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low level ( at +- 7 <br/>\n), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s and the drum, my <br/>\nshadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think) was very jealous, <br/>\nhe walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport :)...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for most quests is, <br/>\nbecause walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not worth it.<br/>\nAnd getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorbolu, 11th at Bertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
