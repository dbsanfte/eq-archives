Well, during the break I was a little <br/>\n&gt; out of the loop so I have a couple of questions regarding this song.  <br/>\n&gt; First off, I know that this is a mob dropped spell in Velious.  What <br/>\n&gt; zones/mobs is it most commonly found on?  And... What are people <br/>\n&gt; paying/charging for this song?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please help, thanks ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n&gt; 51st Minstrel of the Karana Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
