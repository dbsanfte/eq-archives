So you could potentially<br/>\nkill dwarves to gain faction with the giants and remain neutral with the<br/>\ndragons.  Or kill dragons (the wurms I found<br/>\nlast night in the Western Wastes were all green to me at level 51) to improve<br/>\nfaction with giants and remain neutral<br/>\nwith Dwarves.  I&#39;ve decided to kill giants with my wizard to gain faction with<br/>\ndwarves and dragons and to kill dragons<br/>\nwith my paladin to gain faction with giants.  I&#39;ll have to find something else<br/>\nto kill to gain faction with the dwarves for<br/>\nmy paladin.  Speaking of factions, I also killed a few orcs in the zone adjacent<br/>\nto Iceport, but with the faction bug, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t tell which factions were actually being affected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, entered a very very nasty dungeon.

Ended up falling off an icy ledge (note to self: use walk<br/>\non slippery slopes) and the only way<br/>\nout led to a room full of Ice Kobolds that conned even to my 51 wiz.  I had to<br/>\ngate all the way back to the Dragon<br/>\nBridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood news is..  It appears that most mobs in Velious actually can&#39;t see invis.<br/>\nMy wiz explored most of the Giant<br/>\ncity even though he&#39;s probably KOS there.  Only one giant could see invis, and<br/>\nhe appeared to be either a druid<br/>\nor an enchanter since he was buffing mobs around him with a speed-related spell.<br/>\nAlso, every mob I encountered<br/>\noutside of dungeons couldn&#39;t see invis.  And no mobs in that dungeon could see<br/>\ninvis besides a Kobold Prophet.<br/>\nSo, invis appears to be much more effective in Velious than it was in Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerian, 51 wiz - Rodcet Nife<br/>\nSoulsinger, 10 bard - RN</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
