That, and we use a reservation type system<br/>\n(based on EzBoard) where leaders will sign up for entire weeks such that<br/>\nthey can lead given a patch day or a regular respawn and anyone interested<br/>\nin joining the raid can contact them well ahead of time.  Oh, the dragons<br/>\nare booked months ahead of time on Tunare, too, just as something to<br/>\npossibly look forward to dependent on your server.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: John Grady <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 24, 2001 9:42 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Question on getting into Dragon raids<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just starting the epic quest at 52nd and hoping to get into one or two<br/>\n  more Naggy/Vox dragon raids on Xegony before I hit 53rd. So I wanted try<br/>\n  this idea out on everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On my second account would it make sense to create two first level rogues?<br/>\n  One Barb to sneak and park in EF/Perm and one DE to sneak and park in<br/>\n  Lava/Sol B?<br/>\n<br/>\n  While I&#39;m playing Tzeetch, I&#39;m thinking I could check for late night raids<br/>\n  on the second account. (My usual playing time is 10pm ~ 2am PDT.) Sounds<br/>\n  simple, but since I haven&#39;t heard of anyone discuss I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m<br/>\n  missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Btw, any fellow Xegony Bards know of any Friday raids going on for these<br/>\n  two? I have the day off from family and work this Friday :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tzeetch Spellsinger, Minstrel of 52 songs<br/>\n  The Commune, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
