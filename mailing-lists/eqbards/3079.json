A low level cleric can cast Holy Armor and Courage<br/>\n&gt;(stacking with one key stroke each), they&#39;re stacked, he&#39;s done typing.<br/>\n&gt;The Bard however cannot stack without continuous keystrokes (the twitch<br/>\n&gt;part I take exception to).  If we&#39;re supposed to stack persistent songs ...<br/>\n&gt;give us a mechanism that isn&#39;t &quot;twitch&quot; driven to do so.  Or stop<br/>\n&gt;advertising that this isn&#39;t a twitch game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to take exception to labeling &quot;weaving&quot; songs (how&#39;s that instead<br/>\nof twisting J.M. ?) as a twitch activity.  When you&#39;re waiting 4 seconds<br/>\nbetween double keystrokes, it hardly qualifies.  Press 1, wait for effect,<br/>\npress 1 (counts &quot;one one-thousand&quot; for recovery), press 2, wait for effect,<br/>\npress 2, one one-thousand, repeat.  Note: I don&#39;t actually count the<br/>\nrecovery<br/>\npause anymore, it seems to be ingrained in the fingers now.  Also, during<br/>\na weave is the only time my left hand leaves the home row, the other<br/>\nhand rests in the home position on the numpad.  I&#39;ve remapped keys so that<br/>\nI can play with my hands on the wristrest, except while using the trackball.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what I do consider twitch elements are mouselook, and not being able<br/>\nto map strafing to individual keys instead of Ctrl + turn keys, because I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever<br/>\nhad the hand-eye to master mouselook+keyboard to circle strafe a mob and<br/>\nkeep<br/>\na lookout around me during a fight, or just to get behind it while it is<br/>\nfocused on<br/>\na group mate.  My wish list for the interface includes<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Individual strafe keys<br/>\n2.  Glance Left/Right keys.  I.E.  while you&#39;re holding the Glance left<br/>\n     key down, your pov pivots 30degrees to the left, but your movement<br/>\n     direction doesn&#39;t change.  Make this available in 1st person POV and<br/>\n     the from the back 3rd person POV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as weaving goes, I do it 100% of the time during solo fights, but<br/>\nonly<br/>\n50-70% of the time during a group fight.  I was in a great group with two<br/>\nl15 druids (when I was l15 as well) down in paw, and we fought for a good<br/>\n30 minutes before we ended up in a hairy fight and I I began weaving.  We<br/>\nwere so effective before that, that there was no reason to weave.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
