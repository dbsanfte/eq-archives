Next thing we know<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; both<br/>\n&gt;&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tried<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(oops,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept<br/>\n&gt;&gt; smiting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He<br/>\n&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No<br/>\n&gt;&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>\n&gt;&gt; could shed some light on his background?
