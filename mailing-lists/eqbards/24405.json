No more annoying KSers. And you will<br/>\ncome to learn what few bards realize we can do. Charm Kite. This is<br/>\nbasically the strategy of charming MOB A to attack MOB B, repeat until they<br/>\nboth get down in health, recharm the one with the most health to finish the<br/>\nother and then get xp for the kill. Repeat over and over again till you get<br/>\ntired of soloing and raking in a nasty amount of XP. You could also try<br/>\ncharming that annoying PKer and send him in to attack a mid level NPC (ie<br/>\nguards are always fun). That should wittle him down a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO bards basically fill in where needed. We are the cement that holds it<br/>\nall together. Healing and restoring mana where needed. Buffing at times.<br/>\nCham taunting mobs off casters. Intermitent crowd control. Use your<br/>\nimagination because bards will basically fill in any hole in a party.<br/>\n<br/>\nArud Bastad<br/>\n38th level Songstacker Pending Lore<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From:<br/>\nsentto-160851-24424-986578569-matosvr=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theriver.com@...\">theriver.com@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:sentto-160851-24424-986578569-matosvr=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:theriver.com@...\">theriver.com@...</a>.c<br/>\nom]On Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stonemn@...\">stonemn@...</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 06, 2001 10:36 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Hello, new bard (level 3) and well met to all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right now I&#39;m around in Qeynos Hills (on the Tallos Zek server) trying to<br/>\n  stay away from the annoying PKers..(doesn&#39;t anyone ROLEPLAY??, I mean a<br/>\n  paladin running around killing everyone he sees??)<br/>\n<br/>\n  And I was wondering if anyone has any tips for helpful quests.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  already found the copper one, that pretty much got me to second<br/>\n  level...lotsa running though. : )<br/>\n<br/>\n  What are Bards best suited for as they gain levels?  My combat isn&#39;t too<br/>\n  bad..maybe like a Rogue?  And the songs are just too cool...I love<br/>\n  wandering around with a spell up all the time...whichever I choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do we also get songs at every level?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
