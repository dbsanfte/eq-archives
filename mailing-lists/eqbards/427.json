Singing one, getting the<br/>\n&gt; shield up, then stop singing and starting another, then going back to the<br/>\n&gt; first song to keep that shield up.  Some call playing three like this<br/>\n&gt; juggling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have always managed to pull it off, even at lower levels.  When you miss<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; note, just immediately double click the icon you need again, should only<br/>\n&gt; take a split second between each attempt until you get the graphical<br/>\n&gt; pyrotechnics.  Doesn&#39;t seem that I miss notes that often, though, ever.  I<br/>\n&gt; heard charisma had more effect on songs than dexterity.  Dexterity, to me,<br/>\n&gt; seems like it would have an effect on more physical things like how often<br/>\n&gt; one can get in blows with a weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hm, how often is it your missing notes anyway?  Perhaps should test this<br/>\n&gt; with lv 1 bard with low charisma/dexterity high charisma/dexterity.  The<br/>\n&gt; manual says that bards need intelligence, but I don&#39;t believe this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Andy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skimaster@...\">skimaster@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, May 03, 1999 7:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Twisting question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;what is twisting songs?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Illian<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a fun, easy way to stay in touch with family members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Create a ONElist community just for your family! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
