Its sad when a level 14 npc is pounding the hell out<br/>\nof a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances with him. And<br/>\nupon zoning into Sro afterwards, i saw terrorantula, but was alone and not<br/>\ntaking any chances against it, since i would have needed to charm a giant<br/>\nagainst it so it was too dangerous for me and my untrusty ISP.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing kills me more then my connectivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol ro<br/>\nBard of the 31st level<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tGarramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSeptember 12, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re: Fear/Chain, is, not, cheesy, and, is<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what a joke.  have you EVER heard from anyone that they think it is cheesy<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t like you and won&#39;t group with you for doing chain/fear?  the<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; thing i have ever heard is respect for being able to do this, especially<br/>\n&gt; from people who watch or group members.  what i have heard is people<br/>\n&gt; thinking druids are cheesy for kiting or wizards bastards for<br/>\n&gt; kill-stealing.<br/>\n&gt; all druids or wizards?  of course not.  but that i have heard from the<br/>\n&gt; masses, not one thing about chain/fear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, Level 22 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Tyria, Level 16 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; here is a link to the entire guild on EQ&#39;lizer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/class/bard.html\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/class/bard.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Master Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
