Its a crappy DoT<br/>\nthat is rivaled by bellow in damage capacity and a crappy debuff that only<br/>\nlasts like 2 ticks...bleh.  I don&#39;t see how it was improved to be honest.<br/>\nUsing a drum does not seem to have any added benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere could be one problem with your and my testing though, we are testing<br/>\nit on ourselves and therefore under PvP conditions, right? Would that change<br/>\nits affect somewhat?

The part that degrades the hp <br/>\n&gt; would be the<br/>\n&gt; part that might not stack or cancel another caster&#39;s spell - <br/>\n&gt; like darkness<br/>\n&gt; which is a 2 part spell - I do believe DoT and slows them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess it is easy enough to find out what the effects are...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, just tested: cast on self hp dropped from 786 to 765 and <br/>\n&gt; dropped MR from<br/>\n&gt; 51 to 41.  No enhancement with a drum equipped.  So thats 21 <br/>\n&gt; dmg on an even<br/>\n&gt; con.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bellow on blue mobs is hitting at a max of 18. Less on higher cons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The MR seemed to recover on the second pulse. It was <br/>\n&gt; recovered before the<br/>\n&gt; red color on the hp cleared and while hp was still degrading.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, this tells me that it&#39;s use to lower MR would need to be <br/>\n&gt; synchronized<br/>\n&gt; with someone else casting on it. I was thinking that it would <br/>\n&gt; degrade the<br/>\n&gt; mob&#39;s MR and have a recovery period like hp.  But it seems <br/>\n&gt; that the MR would<br/>\n&gt; only maybe be degraded for the next pulse (tick?, round? <br/>\n&gt; ugh!) so the next<br/>\n&gt; song after Fulfils would benefit from the MR degrade.  Which <br/>\n&gt; says that you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; want to weave it between each of the other target songs:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fufil&#39;s - sticks <br/>\n&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>\n&gt; Bellow (less chance of resist)  18 dmg<br/>\n&gt; (mr recovers)<br/>\n&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>\n&gt; (DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; FuFil&#39;s - sticks<br/>\n&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>\n&gt; Largos (less chance of resist)<br/>\n&gt; (mr recovers)<br/>\n&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>\n&gt; (DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fufil&#39;s - sticks<br/>\n&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>\n&gt; Chains (less chance of resist)<br/>\n&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>\n&gt; (DoT is complete)  21 dmg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
