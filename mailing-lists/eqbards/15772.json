Expect to lose a corpse in the wall a few<br/>\ntimes (GMs expect that call and will help, often fairly quickly), or for it<br/>\nnot to be where you would expect it(GM won&#39;t help). Oh and the lava, don&#39;t<br/>\nfall in. No, really. :o) If you do fall in near the entrance , here is the<br/>\ndrill:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM&#39;s won&#39;t help you.<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t levitate, get someone who can, have them step off the stairs<br/>\nand /corpse.<br/>\nThey will now find they can&#39;t get back up.<br/>\nAt the low point of the hall on the way to the swinging blade, at the wall<br/>\nwhich, above the levitater, is the window shortcut, there is a slight step,<br/>\nit is the only way (we found) to get back out of the lava.<br/>\nDon&#39;t fall in the lava again.<br/>\n<br/>\n We only lost one person in the lava ever, and it was because a big, rude<br/>\nBarbarian literally knocked her in as they passed on the stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize,<br/>\nkeep your back to the wall, don&#39;t fall in the lava. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
