I pulled GDB&#39;s for 4 days in unrest before my<br/>\nwife and each had bracelets (I&#39;m not planning on going back to Feydark any<br/>\ntime soon).  A friend of mine who is also a bard was there when I arrived<br/>\nand was still looking for his long after I left.  My fiery vambraces were<br/>\nquick, but it took me 4 hours to get my boots.  Thank god I was with an<br/>\nEXTREMELY competent party and we were able to keep the spawns perfectly<br/>\nbroken up.  Worse yet, it took me 4 straight days in Sol A before I could<br/>\neven find a party willing and competent enough to take the king room.  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine someone lower then 25-27 even having the guts to wander into<br/>\nthe King room to loot the stuff.  I know my party didn&#39;t want me advertising<br/>\nvambraces because of the train one warrior looking to loot a totem brought<br/>\n:-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t even begun to formulate in my mind how I&#39;m going to get the helm<br/>\nor the breast plate.  I can&#39;t imagine any of the drops needed here are going<br/>\nto be cake walks and I&#39;ve never soon Froon and Choon camped (although I<br/>\nspend little time in North Karana).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, other then the gauntlets, I&#39;d say that none of these items is easily<br/>\nobtainable by bards lower then 25th level without significant help.  IMHO, I<br/>\nthink the lambent quests are seem to be as difficult as intended, at least<br/>\nin part.  Now crafted is a different story (talk about a cake walk so far!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 28th song (sliver from 29!)<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 29, 1999 9:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Young &#39;uns getting Lambent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Probably the most depressing thing about the Lambent armor quests (for<br/>\n&gt; me) is the fact that all of these things are heavily camped on weekends.<br/>\n&gt; Of the eight quest objects and three stones that I got over the last two<br/>\n&gt; weekends, I earned exactly two of them in combat.  Everything else I<br/>\n&gt; looted when the camping group let me take a turn, or (in the case of the<br/>\n&gt; stones) was handed to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The upside to this is that lower level Bards can probably expect to get<br/>\n&gt; Lambent Armor much earlier than Verant probably intended.  Because<br/>\n&gt; all of the components are no-drop (and hence financially worthless), most<br/>\n&gt; groups will let you loot the stuff for nothing.  Just go on the weekend<br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s crowded, and bring a good book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
