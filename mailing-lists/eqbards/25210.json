I asked mainly because I am <br/>\n&gt; unsure if keeping<br/>\n&gt; the haste gloves are the most bang for the bucks considering <br/>\n&gt; the other gear<br/>\n&gt; I have.. Furthermore I often feel that my damage output with <br/>\n&gt; weapons really<br/>\n&gt; cant stack up with what I add to a group with my instruments. <br/>\n&gt; So improving<br/>\n&gt; my own haste have never been _that_ important to me. Am I way <br/>\n&gt; off on the<br/>\n&gt; feeling that improving haste isent a main issue for us bards?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Things I considered trying to trade these gloves for are:<br/>\n&gt; - Better weapons<br/>\n&gt; - Better armor (singing steel BP *grin yeah right*)<br/>\n&gt; - Better instruments??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well Im still in doubt what will be the most bang for my <br/>\n&gt; bucks *shrug* Its<br/>\n&gt; the first time I have had an item this valuable...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Musiker<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just to recap what I currently have:<br/>\n&gt; Instruments: Nostrolo tamborine, Mino horn,<br/>\n&gt; Storebought brass horn, Lute of<br/>\n&gt; the Gypsy Princess <br/>\n&gt; Primary Melee: Ykeshan War Club <br/>\n&gt; Secondary Melee: Short Sword of the Ykesha <br/>\n&gt; Ranged Weapon: Runed Bone Fork <br/>\n&gt; Ear: Opalline Earring <br/>\n&gt; Ear: Opalline Earring <br/>\n&gt; Neck: Orc Fang Necklace <br/>\n&gt; Face: Mask of Deception <br/>\n&gt; Head: Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap (Dropped Version)<br/>\n&gt; Or Guardian helmet AC11 some stats<br/>\n&gt; Shoulder: Tattered Mantle <br/>\n&gt; Finger: Silver Fire Emerald ring <br/>\n&gt; Finger: Silver Fire Emerald ring <br/>\n&gt; Wrist: Lambent Bracers <br/>\n&gt; Wrist: Lambent Bracers <br/>\n&gt; Arm: Sleeves of the Ancients <br/>\n&gt; Chest: Lambent Breastplate <br/>\n&gt; Back: Cloak of the Ice Bear <br/>\n&gt; Feet: Singing Steel Boots <br/>\n&gt; Legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\n&gt; Waist: Thick leather apron/Troll hide belt<br/>\n&gt; Hands: Singing Steel Gauntlets <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 17. juli 2001 16:28<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Level 49 bard seeks equipment advice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; allakhazam lists this item at 18K.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe 10K is more realistic.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; FBSS is only haste and goes for 8K (average price)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This item has AC and +3 to **ALL** resists.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resists make it a great item for dragon raids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (And for that reason you might want to just keep this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item...)  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The item is rare at the moment and that may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; artifically increase the price.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for that information.   <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyunes Stratevarius<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of 51 Songs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *snipped my first mail*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
