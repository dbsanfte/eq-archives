Great exp, fine<br/>\nloot, big fun. Now, there was that part where I was trained while pulling,<br/>\ngot charmed, fought as a pet for a while, then when charm broke I was nuked<br/>\nin one hit by a wizard. That was less fun, and frankly reminded me of a<br/>\nrelationship I was in for a while....But after that  things went great.<br/>\nSince I solo&#39;d there at 10 with a shaman before the upgrade it strikes me as<br/>\nall the fun of a low level dungeon, but at 27, which in my experience is<br/>\nrare. Forget the Safe-N-Boring spire groups, if you are Danger Bard go<br/>\ninside, it&#39;s like EQ used to be for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that a few days ago, but didn&#39;t send it. As of last night I have<br/>\nsome new info.<br/>\nFirst of all guilds are doing sweeps in there which leaves very little lower<br/>\nlevel spawn. A bunch of level 35-40 &lt;Runelords&gt; even decided to KS the<br/>\nmeasly entry spawn the weakling level 27 bard was trying to solo, they were<br/>\nabsolute jerks about it, but as it only happened on two spawns one after the<br/>\nother (setting me up for a really fun 10+  minute wait for more) I didn&#39;t<br/>\nbother petitioning. Also, people wander in from SK all the time so it can be<br/>\nfrustrating if one pops and you aren&#39;t totally ready, you may get another<br/>\nlong wait for one little kill. Then again, a nice visitor can really save<br/>\nthe day :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, since I wrote the first bit they have apparently been tweaking Paw,<br/>\nthe entry Gnolls now cast fire shields on themselves (not really a problem<br/>\nwhen doing all instrument attack) and, most oddly, now *poison* you quite<br/>\nfrequently. It is weak poison, but they are now tougher. Also, their magic<br/>\nresist is high for their level.<br/>\n<br/>\nTip: pull WAY back into the entrance hallway, when they run they run fast,<br/>\nand binding doesn&#39;t always stick very well, even when they are near death.<br/>\nIf they pull you out to the big room (or the 3 Gnolls just past the<br/>\nentrance) you will be dead. So give yourself LOTS of hall to play with, it&#39;s<br/>\nworth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, though Paw is one big long train track (with few safe spots) you<br/>\ndon&#39;t always have to bail when someone shouts train, just start doing a /who<br/>\nPersonShoutingTrain and if they disapear from paw you are probably just fine<br/>\n*grin* The longer they live the closer to the zone you should get.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 27, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
