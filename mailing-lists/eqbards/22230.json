Its secondary<br/>\n  resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>\n  it will require an instrument.<br/>\n  The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>\n  tentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>\n  won&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>\n  been nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>\n  perhaps).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pixie Strike is good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Song of Twilight is good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Single target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>\n  As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>\n  song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>\n  used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>\n  hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>\n  enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
