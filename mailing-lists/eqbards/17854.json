(tho this may have changed.  there are only a couple bards<br/>\nleft in the guild at dragon/god level.  there used to be enough to put a<br/>\nbard in every group.)  because of the guild rules this would only happen for<br/>\nus if we joined pickup groups at frenzied, with no guildmates that could<br/>\n*cough* use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s a moot point for me now anyway.  i left the guild.  i never really<br/>\nthought it&#39;d happen.  these are my friends, not people to help me gather<br/>\nloot.  leaving over this issue would&#39;ve been foolish.  but it was pretty<br/>\nclear in the discussion that too many in the guild think we should make<br/>\nuseful chars instead and only dig out the bards at large targets, where<br/>\nwe&#39;re actually useful.  and what a god-awful burden it was getting us bards<br/>\nup to dragon/god level to begin with, why don&#39;t we shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut they&#39;re still my friends, so i won&#39;t say the guild&#39;s name :P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
