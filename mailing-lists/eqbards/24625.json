You&#39;re not going to find <br/>\n&gt; one awesome string instrument that does affect the mana regen <br/>\n&gt; portion of Cantana where others do not.  You can simply take <br/>\n&gt; a store bought lute, test for any increases and adjust that <br/>\n&gt; for all instruments with higher bonuses.  There&#39;s no secrets <br/>\n&gt; or surprises here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darkfox<br/>\n&gt; Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
