I was getting<br/>\nyelled at alot, turned out our monk puller was accidentally switching<br/>\ntargets due to the way he has his mouse controls working. It took us all<br/>\nbeing in the same room playing to finally figure out what was happening. The<br/>\ntip on the mob hitting the puller will probably account for the few<br/>\nmistargets since then. <br/>\nBTW, ever noticed if you hit assist before the puller is back in melee<br/>\nrange, you will sometimes get a different mob, even on a single pull?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
