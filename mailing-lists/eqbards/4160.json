Some topics are great, like the rubicite threads, <br/>\nthe dream weapons and such, but they always take a left turn and end up <br/>\nbeing a huge spam of the ol inbox about twinking and irrelevant stuff.

Well, what this means is: <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; - If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana <br/>\n&gt; regen <br/>\n&gt;   (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>\n&gt; - If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should <br/>\n&gt; increase at the <br/>\n&gt;   same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even <br/>\n&gt; more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this <br/>\n&gt; information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>\n&gt; Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-) <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Synedra of Veshaan<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ---------------------------- <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities. <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ---------------------------- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
