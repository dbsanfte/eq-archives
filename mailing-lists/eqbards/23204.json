Then at<br/>\nleast you could say it wasn&#39;t going anywhere, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just guesses.  Personally, anything that makes a mob too safe,<br/>\nmakes the game too boring.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 16, 2001 3:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: Play the damn mana song (was: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to<br/>\nchang e how ...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are numerous locations in the game where, due to pathing AI, fear<br/>\nkiting is a completely safe tactic.  A good example is by the giant fort in<br/>\nBurning Woods.  If you pull a giant to either side of the ramp, snare it and<br/>\nthen start fearing it, it will just run back and forth while everyone whoops<br/>\nup on it.  Now if fear breaks then the giant will of course start attacking<br/>\nyou.  I have never fear kited in the Overthere location referenced earlier<br/>\nbut if the mob still attacks you when fear breaks or is resisted, then why<br/>\nwould using fear kiting in this location be considered an exploit when it<br/>\nisn&#39;t in other locations?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.

If you fear mobs<br/>\nthere, they run up into the corner and run back and forth mostly up in the<br/>\ncorner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a gm watch me for about 15 minutes up there one evening.  I asked him<br/>\nif he considered it an exploit, and he said &quot;Nope, Great tactics!&quot;  Bear in<br/>\nmind that the mob was never just running into a wall, it was always in<br/>\nmotion, and as long as fear wasnt resisted it stayed on this little path<br/>\nwhere it ran back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
