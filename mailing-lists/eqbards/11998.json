Reminds me of a joke:<br/>\n<br/>\nFour guys are in a car, a mechanical engineer, a chemical engineer, an electrical engineer, and a computer<br/>\nengineer.  The car breaks down.  The mechanical engineer says that it&#39;s a problem with the pistons, they<br/>\nneed to get the car towed so the engine can be reworked.  The electrical engineer insists it&#39;s a problem<br/>\nwith the wiring.  The chemical engineer thinks it&#39;s a fuel problem; if the drain the fuel lines it should<br/>\nclear the problem up.  They turn to the computer engineer, who has been silent to this point, and ask him<br/>\nwhat he thinks.  &quot;I have no idea&quot;, he responds, &quot;but if we all get out of the car, slam the doors real<br/>\nhard, and get back in, it might start up again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
