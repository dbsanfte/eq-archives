To<br/>\ngive you an idea how much 15000 hp is, the L45 paladin and I<br/>\nhacked at him for a good 2 minutes while the cleric went OOM<br/>\nkeeping us healed.  Broog&#39;s hp bar barely budged.  By this<br/>\ntime the others finished off the cyclops (the original<br/>\npull) and jumped in on Broog.  We went on for another 3<br/>\nminutes or so (mid-30s ranger and monk managed to do some<br/>\ntanking as well).  We took off a total of maybe 1/4 of his hp<br/>\nthrough all this, then all our healers were OOM, he dropped<br/>\nthe paladin, started pounding on me, I ran, and he killed 2<br/>\nmore before the others reached the zone.  I lived with 6 hp;<br/>\napparently a level 40 bard&#39;s Accelerando without a drum is<br/>\nfast enough to outrun him even while walking at 6 hp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe named cyclops in the Ocean of Tears (Queg?) is not quite<br/>\nas bad, and he took 6 of us at L40-46 a good 5 minutes to<br/>\nkill.  Not surprisingly, we got 2gp as loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
