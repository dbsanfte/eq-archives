Or are these songs limited like regular spells <br/>\n&gt; appear to be? [I&#39;m pretty sure Hymn of Restoration does not <br/>\n&gt; heal faster, but that too is a question; any chance for a <br/>\n&gt; chorus to be more effective than a soloist?] <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GZ ANSWERS <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Most Bard songs do not stack on top of each other - once you <br/>\n&gt; have a song being sung to you, having more than one person <br/>\n&gt; singing the song does not give any further effect. With the <br/>\n&gt; way EQ Bardic magic was built, Bards are more soloists then <br/>\n&gt; chorus members. Any song with a duration (that leaves an <br/>\n&gt; icon) will not stack - so no, having two Bards using the Hymn <br/>\n&gt; of Restoration will not make you heal faster. Having two <br/>\n&gt; bards using Chords could be more effective then a single Bard <br/>\n&gt; singing it - monsters do occasionally save verses the song. <br/>\n&gt; It would probably be better for the multiple Bard party, <br/>\n&gt; however, to sing different songs. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This being said, the following is a list of Bard songs that <br/>\n&gt; do not have a duration (they leave no icon), and can <br/>\n&gt; therefore be played by any number of Bards at full effect. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   a..
