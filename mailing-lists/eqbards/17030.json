Yes I could give us all a speedup,<br/>\nbut since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>\nmuch.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>\nenchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>\nmix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>\njust-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able to<br/>\nget into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>\nto group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get in<br/>\nlately its always as a tank.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>\nalacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.  Don&#39;t Hymn<br/>\nor you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of anything for<br/>\nme to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a wizard or<br/>\nshaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTowards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>\nanything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;  My<br/>\nreply?  Didn&#39;t have one, told them &quot;I am retiring to the OOT to contemplate<br/>\nlife while beating head on gargoyles for a while.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n\tone very wet minstrel with a headache<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...

Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>\nbeyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>\nin higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>\nworth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>\nI&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>\nrest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>\nrather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>\nuse of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 11:56 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From Eq Casters Realm:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Swift Like The Wind<br/>\n&gt;---------------------<br/>\n&gt;Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>\n&gt;Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of times you<br/>\n&gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>\n&gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>\n&gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>\n&gt;about breaking<br/>\n&gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>\n&gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>\n&gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway. The<br/>\n&gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>\n&gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>\n&gt;----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly matters<br/>\n&gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;speed buffs<br/>\n&gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>\n&gt;She says she does not want me to die that quickly.
