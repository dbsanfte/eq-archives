Too<br/>\nmany higher levs will sponge your xp.  I been in there many hour from 19<br/>\nthru 32 (and 31 and 32 were just despiration camps for xp.) If you have a<br/>\nchoice between being the top dog in the warrior room or low man on totem<br/>\npole in Raider room - I&#39;d choose warrior room - more fite and bigger shares<br/>\nof xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best ever xp I got in HK was when I was 22ish and camped the ramp with a<br/>\n30ish cleric - just me and him.  We discovered kinda by accident that we<br/>\ncould kill the warrior spawns.  I got a bub of xp in about 6 kills but never<br/>\nhad the chance to do that again.  At 30ish, I have spent an hour in HK and<br/>\nbarely see my bub moving - depends on if there are upper levs in my group -<br/>\nif there are - xp is sponged up by them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find your self &quot;stuck&quot;, here are a couple more things to do:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tGo to South karana and get a party together to camp the top floor of<br/>\nthe main aviak tree.  You should be able to muster enough hp from a party to<br/>\nhold that room easily.  There are 5 spawns: 3 perches in the room, the ledge<br/>\nspawn and the Krak buddy spawn (he pulls ez and Krak ignores the fight.)<br/>\nMuch to your delight - you should see 3 avo spawns at times.  You can charm<br/>\nand fight or mez and fight or Melifious Motion and evac.  A side bene of<br/>\navo&#39;s is the chram they drop and the quest for crafted gauntlets.  Assuming<br/>\nyour have the plat to spare, you can &quot;buy&quot; quarter bubs of hp each time you<br/>\ndo the quest.  You got higher up caster pals?  They should be happy to buy a<br/>\nmana pump &lt;g&gt;  If you don&#39;t like doing the quest, you can kill Sharkn the<br/>\nquest giver for xp.  Not sure what faction hits you take if any and it tends<br/>\nto piss off those who do the quest but the respawn time is pretty short. So<br/>\nthe questers can do their thing and you can kill him again.  At 32ish, he<br/>\nwas a blue con and I saw a druid who should have had better things to do<br/>\nkilling Sharkn until he was nearly 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tGoto Unrest if you have a good group or can get in a good group.<br/>\nCamp the basement torture chamber (first big basement room) 4 spawns in the<br/>\nroom easy to hold at your level and great steady supply of blues.  Beware of<br/>\nGhost Room trains - be ready to evac and come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 30, I saw the end of my days in HK.  I know some stay til 35 but sheesh<br/>\nit&#39;s a waste of time when there are still other good places and stuff you<br/>\nneed to be learning.  Like around 30 and even before - mid to hi 20&#39;s, I<br/>\nthink you should be learning upper guk. In lo to mid 30&#39;s you will be<br/>\ntravelling thru upper guk pretty often, so it will be worth your time to<br/>\nlearn it - I am still lost and depend on my group to lead me thru and feel<br/>\nlike an idjit.  Same thing for Sol-A.  Time to learn how to get there and<br/>\nback and maybe do some small excursions in Sol-A.  You should get good XP<br/>\nthere - just need to be careful that you can evac to a zone.  The zone<br/>\nhuggers in these higher zones face the trains of the higher lev mobs and<br/>\nthey can hurt ya bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my book, HK is the place to be from 20ish thru 30 - mixed with liberal<br/>\ndoses of South Karana, Upper Guk, Sol-A (carefully).<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tKen Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, October 27, 1999 8:47 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] level 32 and not sure!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAt the insistence of my higher-level friends, who want me to<br/>\nget Level 32 as fast <br/>\n\t\tas possible, I&#39;ve been hanging around High Keep for several<br/>\nlevels now. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI would estimate that you can pick up a bubble of exp once<br/>\nevery two to three <br/>\n\t\thours, depending on the group you&#39;re in (level 30 excepted).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKenross Cantoforjado, 30 songs (still), Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tPS - Be sure to say &quot;Hi&quot; to me if you come by.
