So are all caster buffs going to end when the <br/>\n&gt; caster logs off<br/>\n&gt; so they can&#39;t park an enchanter nearby just to clarity and <br/>\n&gt; log him on and<br/>\n&gt; off?  Plain and simple this is stupid.  It&#39;s another example of where<br/>\n&gt; probably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we <br/>\n&gt; all have to be<br/>\n&gt; nerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid <br/>\n&gt; they should<br/>\n&gt; handle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is <br/>\n&gt; inactive for more<br/>\n&gt; than 10 minutes like most games do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 1:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Absor has asked everyone to switch to a different thread on this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this <br/>\n&gt; is to keep us <br/>\n&gt; from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 12:58 PM 10/31/00 -0700, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course this will make Aria and Clouding instant death <br/>\n&gt; songs in many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;situations.

The message received is evidently &quot;Your song <br/>\n&gt; ends abruptly&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant <br/>\n&gt; seems to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from <br/>\n&gt; the keyboard<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the <br/>\n&gt; keyboard to keep<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song up as well.
