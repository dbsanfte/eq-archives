Verants ENTIRE aim, in my opinion, is to SLOW US DOWN.  In<br/>\nfact, when the first member of our guild with a VP key went and peeked in,<br/>\nhe was told by a GM something to the effect of &quot;First FoH, then Afterlife,<br/>\nnow  you.. you guys weren&#39;t supposed to be in VP for six months.&quot;  Don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how true that is, but to me they are looking for ways to slow us down<br/>\neven more.  Its funny that a game as &quot;successful&quot; as EQ that the players are<br/>\nat actual WAR with creators.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 56 Shaman<br/>\nTani, 28 Bard<br/>\n&lt;Paradigm&gt;<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason for the uproar is that the ENTIRE game up to this <br/>\n&gt; point has been<br/>\n&gt; tested and balanced with the &#39;haste bug&#39; in place.  All those <br/>\n&gt; fast spawning<br/>\n&gt; kunark dungeons we are supposed to due are now going to be <br/>\n&gt; much harder, as<br/>\n&gt; either the groups will be killing things slower or spending <br/>\n&gt; more mana to<br/>\n&gt; kill things at the same pace.  Either way total combat time (battle +<br/>\n&gt; recovery) will be longer as more mana will be spent (more <br/>\n&gt; mana for haste or<br/>\n&gt; more mana for healing/damage spells).  The PvE balance is <br/>\n&gt; about to get a<br/>\n&gt; huge push, to the detrement of the players.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katy-w@...\">katy-w@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 19, 2000 6:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Prepare for another nerf... =8^P<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *snip haste stacking bug being fixed*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been <br/>\n&gt; referred to as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find <br/>\n&gt; it.  Well,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work <br/>\n&gt; that way and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask <br/>\n&gt; them to fix<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* <br/>\n&gt; bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  <br/>\n&gt; Could happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [49 Bard] Robynn Merrilin (Wood Elf) &lt;Disciples of Honor&gt; ZONE: E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Katy Westerman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katy-w@...\">katy-w@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t lick something unless you really mean it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;              -Advice from the Naked Dancing Llama<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
