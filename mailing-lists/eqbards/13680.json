Get levitate and SoW.  Track (ok have ranger friend track) DW<br/>\n&gt; gobbies. Get right on top of them and agro them with Chords or other AE<br/>\n&gt; song. Run for the zone.  Have a ranger cast snare on one and zone out then<br/>\n&gt; right back in.  Find the snared one and kill him.

I killed about 15 of them, no helm, using the<br/>\n  tactics above, we could handle 4 DW goblins at once, very hurt<br/>\n  after battle.  DW goblins are wizards, clerics, or warriors.<br/>\n  I got experience from 2 of the 15 in group, if that indicates <br/>\n  anything about their raw power.  I couldn&#39;t break the spawn,<br/>\n  they spawn way too quickly, and were always available when I went<br/>\n  out to collect them.  I usually got one at a time, but that got<br/>\n  boring so I farmed them in groups.  Still no helm, sigh.  Sorry<br/>\n  Kenross.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
