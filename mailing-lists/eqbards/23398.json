This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>\non innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>\nlove my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>\nsuggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>\ncertain something that my bard does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>\nsoloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>\nsinging.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>\ninstruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>\nusing chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>\nto kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>\ndo I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>\nand strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
