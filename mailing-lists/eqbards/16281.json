On Fennin Ro (crowded as hell) the King/Priest/Champ are all<br/>\nthree different groups.  Always.  The fact that a group came in and started<br/>\ncamping the Priest when the Champ room felt like King/Priest/Champ were all<br/>\ntheirs are simply wrong.  This would *never* fly on Fennin Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on Druzzil Ro, with the Sol B population at 20 or 30, sometimes the<br/>\nKing/Priest/Champ is all one camp, but having come from Fennin, no one is<br/>\nshocked when others come in and set up camp.  Normally a King/Priest/Champ<br/>\ngroup will base itself in the King room so that is this happens they still<br/>\nget the primo camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this guild&#39;s use of the Play Nice policy to break the player<br/>\n&gt; made agreement that&#39;s been in effect in Sol B on our server.
