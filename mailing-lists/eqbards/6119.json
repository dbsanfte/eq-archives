You create a hot key <br/>\nbank with your secondary weapon slot and one general inventory slot.  Hot <br/>\nkey the following songs: Denon&#39;s disruptive discord, Chords of dissounces, <br/>\nHymn of restoration, and Psalm of Warmth (the last is a personal favorite <br/>\ndue to the damage shield).<br/>\n<br/>\nEquip your horn and have your lute &#39;held&#39; on your mouse pointer. Fire off <br/>\nDDD, when the wince message flashes stop DDD and start CoD while equiping <br/>\nyour Lute.  When the wince message shows, start either Hynm or Psalm <br/>\ndepending on the flow of battle.  When the third song starts, stop it and <br/>\nrestart DDD while equiping your horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits are huge for this DDD does around 20 damage a round (round = 6 <br/>\nseconds) for 3 rounds (first round plus two more) it also lowers AC making <br/>\nit easier for tanks to hit for more damage. CoD does around 14 damage a <br/>\nround for 3 rounds.  Since both these songs are AE this damage is done to <br/>\nall your targets (which can draw alot of attention to the bard).  Hymn will <br/>\nof course heal the whole party every round.  Psalm is great in that it gives <br/>\nall party members a 5 pt fire based damage shield that stacks with all other <br/>\nnon-cold based damage shields.  Besure to have a good cleric around as if <br/>\nthere is more the 2 or 3 mobs you will get pounded hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I have unintentionally stolen kills from people using this combo :p<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Instruments vs. Melee quandry<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 09:01:08 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail all,<br/>\n&gt;I am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>\n&gt;Recently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train <br/>\n&gt;*laughs*<br/>\n&gt;and ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>\n&gt;flabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric and<br/>\n&gt;wizard). So I have been playing the the horn and Dennons Dischord  then<br/>\n&gt;swapping to the lute for chains or lull, then back to the horn. It&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt;really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>\n&gt;figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
