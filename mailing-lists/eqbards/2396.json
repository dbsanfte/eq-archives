The message boards on EQ<br/>\nVault for some reason have flamed FoH every step of the way.  They call them<br/>\ncheaters, exploiters, and worse.  I have found this to not be the case.  I have<br/>\ncome into contact with several FoH and, although they may be short tempered and<br/>\nrude sometimes, this in no way precludes cheating, exploiting, or worse.  They<br/>\nare the highest level guild in the game because they are willing to give up<br/>\ntheir external lives, if ones existed, and play EQ 18 hours a day.  I am not<br/>\nwilling to make that sacrifice, are any of you?  They earned their positions and<br/>\nall the benefits that come from it, so it is unfair to flame them in fits of<br/>\njealousy, which is what those on EQVaults message boards do.<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver<br/>\nVizier of Akalabeth<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps the people on the other list wouldn&#39;t fill that way if they had been<br/>\n&gt; reading some of the posts on this list by JM and the other high level<br/>\n&gt; contributors:-).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did notice one of the posts was from a member of the Fires of Heaven guild<br/>\n&gt; (the guild who recently kiiled Lady Vox with/without the help of Aradune).<br/>\n&gt; I play on E&#39;ci so have no idea how this guild operates and really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care.  However, if you believe some of the recent posts on EQVault, the<br/>\n&gt; Fires of Heaven guild consists primarily of powergamers.  From all the great<br/>\n&gt; posts I have read on this list, the general consensus among us seems to<br/>\n&gt; indicate that playing a bard is not very suitable to the type of person who<br/>\n&gt; powergames.  Perhaps that is why the poster felt that bards were useless.<br/>\n&gt; Pure speculation on my part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; Bard and Master Brewer of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Crip Fireblade from FoH here...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl 49 bard on Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     My question or statement is really bards are totally screwed over at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high levels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not only do they have no chance of meleeing even a tenth as well as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior, but there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are NO high level songs that are worthwhile.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt; Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
