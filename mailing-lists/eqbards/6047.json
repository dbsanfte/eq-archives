We have<br/>\ntried having me play instruments but I still do too much melee damage to<br/>\nsimply play. So the cleric/warrior keep me alive (they are husband and wife<br/>\nand in the same room so they work GREAT together) and I melee. I don&#39;t see<br/>\nthis changing for a long time, unless we get another tank (which I would<br/>\nLOVE).
