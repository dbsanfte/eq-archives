I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure why but there were multiple laughers so I backed off.  I <br/>\n&gt; did almost get<br/>\n&gt; a thick banded belt bizarrely from one of the guys who said I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have a<br/>\n&gt; chance in Guk of seeing a troll hide belt.  Bizarre, truly bizarre.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thought about the claws.  Umm, no def not my style.  In <br/>\n&gt; fact, now that I<br/>\n&gt; think about it, ick.  I&#39;d rather use my crappy combine scimmy <br/>\n&gt; than look like<br/>\n&gt; some wolvie clone or mr krueger&#39;s understudy.  Sigh, guess if <br/>\n&gt; I insist on<br/>\n&gt; cool and useful I&#39;ll just have to wait.

They are bard/rogue only so <br/>\n&gt; the demand<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t as<br/>\n&gt; high for them.  Those two will give you ten more points to <br/>\n&gt; your STR.  After<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; got those two items I was able to start wearing bronze plate <br/>\n&gt; and still have<br/>\n&gt; room<br/>\n&gt; to carry stuff.  My base STR is 76 and with items is now 100.  Another<br/>\n&gt; option is<br/>\n&gt; the Blackened Iron Crown in Runnyeye. I think it also adds <br/>\n&gt; five points to<br/>\n&gt; STR<br/>\n&gt; plus bonuses to resists.  For weapons, thulian claws seem to <br/>\n&gt; be the bard<br/>\n&gt; weapon<br/>\n&gt; of choice for those in their 20s and will cost around 400PP.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 12 Oct 1999 10:24:36 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hail all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After my latest adventure grouping with our guilds new <br/>\n&gt; wizard in cleri&#39;c<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clothing I decided to foray off and try my hand at soloing <br/>\n&gt; once more.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have journeyed to far off Upper Guk where I have been <br/>\n&gt; taking on the Heart<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Spiders found there.  The experience has thus far been most <br/>\n&gt; fruitful both<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; terms of silks and xp.  While I died 4 times the first <br/>\n&gt; nite, my ping was<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an all time record low (for me) and I was able to make it <br/>\n&gt; back to my body<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 27 minutes!  I have found my experience bar moving steadily <br/>\n&gt; upward and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expect to make 18th level tonite.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My question is this?  What sort of equipment should I start <br/>\n&gt; looking for at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my level to help improve my performance.  A lot of the <br/>\n&gt; equipment I have<br/>\n&gt; now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is already better than I could get on my own as my trade skills have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually been profitable!  Sssshhh... don&#39;t tell Verant.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need most is a primary weapon upgrade, I am currently alternating<br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a Dragoon Dirk and a Screaming Mace as primary.  I have <br/>\n&gt; about 250pp, but<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easily make another 100-200 by selling cured silk this <br/>\n&gt; week.  I welcome<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggestions that don&#39;t require me to carry a stupid axe ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think my armor is as good as it will be for a while, <br/>\n&gt; except maybe for my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helm.  I have Barbed Arms and legs, Crush tunic, <br/>\n&gt; Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bearskin Boots, a sleek black cape, Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; helm, 2 jagged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bands, bracer of erolissi, silver-plated bracer, purity <br/>\n&gt; belt (still?),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; electrum pearl necklace (upgrade to gold?).  I use a chitin <br/>\n&gt; shell shield<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dual wield depending on the situation.  Any ideas what <br/>\n&gt; armor upgrades I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could get without bumping my weight up too much?  I&#39;m a <br/>\n&gt; natural weakling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Str73) so have concentrated on stat boosting armor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tThanks for the input!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \t\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; \t\tsomewhere in Guk looking for a &#39;real&#39; cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\n&gt; the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
