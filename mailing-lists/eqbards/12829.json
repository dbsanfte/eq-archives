And of course my party is asking for the healing song in down<br/>\ntime, and I would have loved to.  Except I&#39;m stuck playing binding and<br/>\ndaren&#39;t move in case I bring the whole house down on us!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, nothing I could think of doing would stop the silly song from<br/>\nplaying.  Tried /stopsong, no luck.  I hope I just had the syntax<br/>\nwrong please!  But I even tried .... sitting, ducking, reading my<br/>\nsongbook, even went so far as unmemming a song and re-memming it, but<br/>\nno luck.  Didn&#39;t want to zone for fear of having a train behind me all<br/>\nnodding!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me I&#39;m not alone in this!  And is there any way of<br/>\nactually correcting it apart from getting stunned, or how about what<br/>\ncauses the song to get stuck and I&#39;ll try to avoid it again!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;grumble, mumble, grumble&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSaldara, High Elf Wizard (29 retired)<br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (20)<br/>\nMith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
