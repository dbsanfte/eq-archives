EQ is a DX6 app and T&L was added in DX7. OpenGL apps, e.g.<br/>\nQuake123, do take advantage of the T&L acceleration however.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff is right, GeForce does offer a significant boost over TNT2, with<br/>\nnearly twice the fill rate.  This translates directly to improved<br/>\nframerates at higher resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodic of MoY, bard of 33 songs<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Illian wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bear in mind that 99.9% of the games out there do not take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advantage of the GeForce&#39;s improved hardware (transformation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and lighting is still handled by the CPU).  This includes EQ.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup over a TNT2,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you see in some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reviews.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why? Because my brother<br/>\n&gt; in law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife has the same setup<br/>\n&gt; with a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my GeForce at 1024X768<br/>\n&gt; that they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There is a HUGE<br/>\n&gt; performance increase that is VERY noticable if you have your<br/>\n&gt; computers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24 person raid on Kedge<br/>\n&gt; Keep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off, same setup on<br/>\n&gt; all 3 computers and they were both lagging and had much much lower<br/>\n&gt; frame rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at 1024x768 as I<br/>\n&gt; would have been had I been the only one in the zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
