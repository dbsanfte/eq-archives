She had to log<br/>\n&gt;before we got to test it) were if I could lay down a SoT or 2 until the<br/>\n&gt;chanters got the mobs locked down, it would be a huge boon for raids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does SoT block any/all enchanter mez?<br/>\n&gt;Does it overwrite?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It completely blocks it. :(  Someone mentioned it might get fixed soon. <br/>\nLet&#39;s hope so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will try to test this on my own, but how often do you have a lvl 60<br/>\n&gt;enchanter at your disposal?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Almost daily and we have to deal with this more often than I like, but many <br/>\ntimes it has kept him from getting killed. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Elfson Allego &lt;The CIrcle of Eternity&gt;<br/>\n&gt;53 Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;^^^ Hoping to get to 54 before Bard BOTB so he layeth the smack down on<br/>\n&gt;Sartori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>DOH....
