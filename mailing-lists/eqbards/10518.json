I was in Sol B<br/>\nlast night with some pals in their high 30s and low 40s killing Greater<br/>\nKobolds.  We were in the King room pulling Kobolds from around the place.<br/>\nThe first time our puller said he was pulling the Noble (an Enchanter) I<br/>\nsaid &quot;Gimmie a sec&quot; and memmed Guardian and Elemental.  &quot;Go ahead.&quot; I said<br/>\nas I equipped my MM Battle Drums.  Well the Noble got there and dropped FAST<br/>\nas most casters do when they can&#39;t get a spell off in the first place and<br/>\nwhen they do it&#39;s resisted.  My lineup was Pixie Strike, Guardian and<br/>\nElemental.  After the fight when everyone was saying &quot;That was pretty easy.&quot;<br/>\nI said &quot;Look at your MR.&quot;  I got the typical &quot;DAMN!  MR 134!&quot; and stuff like<br/>\nthat.  After that our puller started say &quot;Noble, you ready Crier?&quot;  hehe..<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 34th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; They want you because they see you as a mana stone.  I&#39;d say forget about<br/>\n&gt; any offense songs in battle - maybe try CoD if you want to weave something<br/>\n&gt; in.  Play the buff songs that stack.  Anthem, elemental or<br/>\n&gt; purity, guardian<br/>\n&gt; - use a drum - do you have MM drums? When you have the MR buffs<br/>\n&gt; stacked make<br/>\n&gt; sure you have them check their MR you will here stuff like &quot;holy<br/>\n&gt; moly MR 130<br/>\n&gt; woo hoo!&quot; and esp if someone else has MR buffed the party.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; they will<br/>\n&gt; resist the fear and such - really fun to see this in Kith where<br/>\n&gt; the mob use<br/>\n&gt; so much magic and melee hard too. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
