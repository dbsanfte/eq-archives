Just pick your targets carefully, and kick in the bardboots <br/>\nsong and run if your health goes below half or if a second creature engages <br/>\nyou while you&#39;re fighting the first one.  (Skeletons are especially a <br/>\nproblem this way, since they stun.  I died only once to a drake, but <br/>\nseveral times to skeletons or skeleton-rat gangups, because they stunned me <br/>\nand kept me from runnint.)  And of course if you see the Minotaur Hero, run <br/>\nfor the city or the zoneline.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly <br/>\ndifficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which <br/>\nprobably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you  <br/>\n increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party <br/>\nthan solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even <br/>\nif I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between <br/>\nhealing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few <br/>\npoints), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could <br/>\nmanage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long <br/>\nbetween battles to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
