I was camping the Savant and<br/>\nCavalier (Sav/Cav) last night with a competent group.  We had a Cleric,<br/>\nShaman, Ranger, Warrior, Magician and Myself (39th bard).  Pretty balanced.<br/>\nWe were pulling both rooms to the Savant area and fighting there.  I was<br/>\nbrought on as mana pump but my team was very pleasantly surprised to find<br/>\nthat I could twist three songs, melee fairly effectively and perform crowd<br/>\ncontrol.  We were so successful that we cleared all the way from the Sav<br/>\nroom to the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons (GIBS) and started pulling those.<br/>\nAfter having to alternately Pixie Strike two GIBS during a 10+ minute battle<br/>\nand having resists and missed notes allow them break out and freeze me from<br/>\ntime to time I decided I&#39;d dust off Lullaby and try it.  Heh.  Never again.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t die thanks to the Cleric and Shaman, but Lullaby had virtually no<br/>\neffect other than Taunt.  If they&#39;re mezzed with Lullaby, it&#39;s so brief as<br/>\nto be negligible.  GZ would probably remind me that &quot;higher level mobs have<br/>\na greater chance of resisting&quot;, which is fine I suppose, but damn - give me<br/>\nresist messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 39th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
