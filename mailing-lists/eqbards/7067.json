I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1281294599\">* SNIP *<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there is any good &quot;balance&quot; issue served. Melee classes don&#39;t seem<br/>\nto have any special talent to offset their lack of binding ability. I think when<br/>\nVerant decided not to implement a &quot;Lifestone&quot; sort of model for changing a<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s return point, they were forced to give this ability to the<br/>\ncharacters. The casting classes seemed to be the logical choice, since changing<br/>\nthis &quot;mystical bond&quot; does involve manipulation of magical forces. But melee<br/>\nclasses never really got anything in return. And I don&#39;t believe they ever will.<br/>\nI think players have to understand that choosing a melee class means you WILL be<br/>\ndependent upon the binding abilities of others throughout your character&#39;s life.<br/>\nYou can accept that and play a melee class anyway, or not accept that and play a<br/>\ncaster class. I&#39;m not too hopeful of seeing other options coming forth on a<br/>\nclass-wide basis. (However, I do see the possibility of more items with Bind<br/>\nAffinity effects being made available.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* SNIP *<br/>\n<br/>\nYah, probly time to close this whole thing out...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the record, I don&#39;t mind being at the mercy of binders...I just want to<br/>\nbe bound in non-city locations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd having to choose between a class I don&#39;t want to play, and having to endure<br/>\nthe walk-of-shame is pretty unappealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I have to say that most greens can really be deadly to a naked melee<br/>\nguy.   Also, saying that other classes (casters, btw) can help you isn&#39;t really<br/>\na solution.  They may be willing to cast on you, but I rarely find them on way<br/>\nto my body.  Besides, that doesn&#39;t solve the problem, it just makes you more<br/>\ndependent on others...<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh...sooo bitter these days! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias the bitterest bard ever!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
