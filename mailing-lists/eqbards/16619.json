I know what you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-819257246\">I play on Veeshan also, it can get busy at times but me being from England<br/>\nI get to play when the servers are under populated (1200-1400 ppl). I know<br/>\nwhat you mean about experience though, I have only recently got through 40<br/>\n(took me 3 weeks). An excellent place for exp at your level would be Dwarf<br/>\nNPC&#39;s in Butcherblock, you only loose faction with the residents and not<br/>\nguards. If you can get a 2 spawn dwarf camp you can sit there for hours<br/>\nCharming them and then killing the winner using Fear/snare (or Kiting). The<br/>\nspawns are 12 minutes usually but they are great exp. Also solo&#39;ing giants<br/>\nis another good option.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not you could try Mistmoore, if you can get a group from your guild to<br/>\ntake you there and simply powerlevel you I can assure you that you will get<br/>\nthrough 35 in a day. I made 1.5 bubs of level 35 exp in 3 hours and I was<br/>\ngrouped with level 45+ people.<br/>\n<br/>\nyou will get there, don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kevin L.

Crawford&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for fun and adventure at level 35 on Veeshan....<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t say Guk.  I can walk from live side tower to dead side tower<br/>\nand not run into a single NPC in lower guk on veeshan.  The server is THAT<br/>\ncrowded.  Almost 50%+ of the players are 35+ now (server REALLY needs to be<br/>\nsplit).  Soldung B is the same.  Asside from doing FG&#39;s or Efreet with my<br/>\nguild there&#39;s no point in even visiting those two dungeons unless I&#39;m after<br/>\na specific item.  (No problem getting in a group, but XP is another<br/>\nquestion entirely).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hunted in Kithicor last night, that was fun.  I&#39;d LOVE to get a group<br/>\ntogether to do PAW but I rarely have time to get into an organized group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, advice welcome.  I made it to 50 on Test BEFORE there was ever more<br/>\nthan 300 people online at a time.  Test was pristine back then.  On Veeshan<br/>\nI have a hard time levelling just because I can&#39;t find anything to kill.<br/>\nEverything is camped to high heaven.  Even giants are hard to find these<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nUngh!<br/>\n<br/>\n1800-2200 players online.  60-70% are hunting the high level areas....<br/>\n**sighs**<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people wonder why I spend most of my time in Asheron&#39;s Call now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
