I died in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest, and was revived (LOVE that spell - saved me a ten minute walk<br/>\n&gt; back), and was nailed with the typical regeneration effects.  This effect<br/>\n&gt; is supposed to prevent you from immediately being buffed and ready to<br/>\n&gt; charge - however, Bardic songs seem to be immune to this particular effect.<br/>\n&gt;  I was able to sing all of my songs immediately afterwards, and suffered<br/>\n&gt; nothing except a massive loss of mana.
