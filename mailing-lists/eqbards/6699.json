He&#39;s a factor in the fight in that he can stand there being<br/>\n&gt; beaten on for 30 seconds with out taking any damage while everyone else<br/>\n&gt; in the group can nuke or beat on the mob. Now granted, I have never seen<br/>\n&gt; anyone use this technique (and if it became popular and well known I<br/>\n&gt; would be willing to bet Verant would nerf devine aura, assuming it was<br/>\n&gt; effective) but in a way it makes them the perfect tank for 30 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; They can soak up huge amounts of damage without actually taking any.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too have never seen a cleric use it this way.  Seems all of<br/>\nthem want to save it just in case they really do get in<br/>\ntrouble.  Go figure.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The biggest problem with Bards at later levels, IMO is that most groups<br/>\n&gt; (at least on our server) go to item distribution based on need, rather<br/>\n&gt; than the various schemes like alpha used by lower levels. I believe this<br/>\n&gt; is used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard is known as<br/>\n&gt; a mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the weapons we<br/>\n&gt; can use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we have no bard<br/>\n&gt; only weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>\n&gt; the item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>\n&gt; Ykesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; making as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of agree and disagree.  When I group randomly, the<br/>\nitems usually go via lotto.  So far people have been pretty<br/>\ngood about withdrawing their names from the lotto if they<br/>\ncan&#39;t use or don&#39;t need an item (i.e. already have something<br/>\nbetter).  But I see your point about need-based distribution<br/>\nbeing worse than lotto in long run for bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I group with friends - folks I spend most of my time<br/>\nwith, I *want* the items to go to the person who can make the<br/>\nbest use of it.  I spend a large portion of my time grouped<br/>\nwith them, so making them lots more effective is usually<br/>\nbetter than making me marginally more effective.  We&#39;re also<br/>\npretty good about redistributing old items when someone gets<br/>\nan upgrade, so it&#39;s not like I never get anything.  I may not<br/>\nget something fresh off the mob&#39;s corpse, but I do get things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, more special instruments would help alleviate this<br/>\nproblem.  There&#39;s not question who those go to.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
