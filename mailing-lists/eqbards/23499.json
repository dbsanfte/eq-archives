Based on the info on the eqsongs website, at 50th level with a<br/>\nSelos Drum I should be doing the following amount of damage:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 30:  31 base damage per tick/42 per tick with Selos Drum/125 total for<br/>\n3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 62 damage total for 50th level with Selos<br/>\ndrum<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 38:  48 base damage per tick/65 per tick with Selos drum/195 total for<br/>\n3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 93 damage total for 50th level with Selos<br/>\ndrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 46:  Same as 38 except your spreadsheet list 95 damage total for 50th<br/>\nlevel with Selos drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the values that are listed take into account the 2/3 PvP penalty.<br/>\nBut even if you factor that in, the values don&#39;t seem to be correct.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the speed debuff and damage values for Chords of Cessation do not match<br/>\nup with the values posted on eqsongs.  EQsongs lists the damage as 50pts per<br/>\ntick while you list 75.  Eqsongs lists the speed debuff as 16% while you<br/>\nlist 30%. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reed Stormwind [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqreed@...\">eqreed@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 10:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Reed&#39;s Bard Song Calculatr 1.09 Available<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry that it&#39;s a little late.
