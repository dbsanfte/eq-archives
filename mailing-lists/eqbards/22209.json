The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;, and<br/>\n&gt;has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>\n&gt;putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard if<br/>\n&gt;we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep one<br/>\n&gt;song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lago Bardoon of Bertoxx, 48th Composition, Defenders of Aleria<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
