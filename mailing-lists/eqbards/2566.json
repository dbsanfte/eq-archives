Sure if players camp for the bug and make it a<br/>\nparty, I as Verant or a GM might get kinda pissed, but those players<br/>\nshouldnt be banned for seeing something you as a programmer might have<br/>\nmissed.  If anything I&#39;d toss a mean mob in there and mix it up a little<br/>\nbit.  Verant needs people to point out the little things they missed, ya<br/>\nhave to with a world this big with this much code etc etc.  This isnt just<br/>\nwhining, people do whine all the time, I whined on my first boat crash, I<br/>\nthought I lost my 20+days of time working on my first character, I whined<br/>\nwhen my character dissappeared and then came back 2 lvls less.  In time I<br/>\ngot experience to learn that, &quot;they know, they know&quot; so I dont whine<br/>\nanymore, and I try and make sure if I ever do a petition its very clean and<br/>\nstraight to the point.  Of course exploiting the bug and taking advantage is<br/>\ndifferent matter all together, you should play honorably and not use such<br/>\nways as this to gain your XP.  But banning them?  Thats a little extreme I<br/>\nthink.  Personally I&#39;d either fix the code (if possible), remove the code or<br/>\nNPC, or put a randomily spawning sand giant there or some other nasty<br/>\ncritter to help change peoples minds from using it as an XP point.  EQ is a<br/>\nvast game, I&#39;m sure many things can be exploited, from the trust you recieve<br/>\nfrom others to quirks in the gaming code to the 2500 plat on Ebay for $250.<br/>\nI suppose EQ isnt perfect after all eh?  But it sure is damn fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nGediprime<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 28, 1999 6:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] EQ slang<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrS8N@...\">MrS8N@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You DO realize that what you are describing, the trapping of a creature<br/>\nand then<br/>\n&gt; killing it without risk to yourself, is a bannable offense right?
