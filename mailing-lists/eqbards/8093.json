I understand and respect your decision to do whatever you want.

I will make this<br/>\n&gt;short.  I am going to do what Harmonic wants to do.  If I want<br/>\n&gt;to call fear/chains, reverse-kiting -or- if I want to play the<br/>\n&gt;Jig o&#39; Vigor because it makes people feel better, I WILL.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand and respect your decision to do whatever you want.  I also <br/>\nprefer myself to inform people who have misconceptions about how bard songs <br/>\nwork, as a service to other bards who will someday group with the same <br/>\npeople who don&#39;t understand us now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the reverse-kiting issue, I think the only point here is that kiting <br/>\nhas somehow acquired a very bad reputation among Norrathian citizens (almost <br/>\nexclusively those classes who can&#39;t do it, in fact), and since 1) chains and <br/>\nkiting does not involve the monster chasing you (one of the fundamental <br/>\nconcepts of kiting, thus the recent nerf); and 2) having the word kiting in <br/>\nthe name will cause any number of misconceptions and resentment, it is not <br/>\nunreasonable that we, as a bardic community, try to find a more appropriate <br/>\nterm for this activity.  This term I will leave to our more experienced <br/>\nbrethren to provide, as I don&#39;t have the songs in question, and have thus no <br/>\npersonal experience with chains + fear.  Should such a term be created, it <br/>\nis of course your choice to use it or not as you prefer.  For the record, I <br/>\nhate the terms &quot;twisting&quot; and &quot;juggling&quot; (referring to our songs) and have <br/>\nalways used &quot;harmonizing&quot; in their place, an idiosyncracy on a related note, <br/>\nas it were.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Can we please move on, and get off these kinda of &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;like your style&quot; comments?  I mean come on, guys.  I play<br/>\n&gt;my way, and you&#39;ll play yours.  There&#39;s no reason to try to<br/>\n&gt;change any of that.  I&#39;m not telling you all what to say<br/>\n&gt;or which songs to play, unless it&#39;s a suggestion in a battle<br/>\n&gt;situation.  I suggest you respect me in the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey, I like your style, even if I do things differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m not upset, but I already have a mother who asks me if<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m eating the right foods and taking care of myself.  You<br/>\n&gt;all don&#39;t need to take up that task, you&#39;ve got more important<br/>\n&gt;things to worry about (so to speak) =)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Harmonic, that reminds me.  Your mother asked me to make sure you weren&#39;t <br/>\neating that summoned black bread - that stuff will rot your teeth.  Do you <br/>\nstill have that Shawl of the Wind Spirit?  Forecasts for today are cold and <br/>\nwet, so do bundle up.  Please try to get one helping of foraged veggies a <br/>\nday, and remember what she always told you: &quot;A Hymn a day keeps the clerics <br/>\naway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
