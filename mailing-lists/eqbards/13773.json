Verant messed up big time<br/>\nand thought it would take skill and a long time to get to 50 all it takes is<br/>\ntime and that&#39;s where they messed up. they figured they could add zones over<br/>\ntime. I agree that overcrowding is felt at lower levels during prime time<br/>\nbut at high levels it&#39;s 24/7 because well we play a lot heh. Ahh well I just<br/>\nthink they need to add some more zones before we get to even half of what<br/>\nyou guys feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 7:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hho@...\">hho@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Naeeldar,<br/>\n&gt;I dont think that anyone disagrees..

The diffrence is these 50&#39;s are not the average player we<br/>\n&gt;are all huge addicts and play a good 10 hours a day usually. So maybe you<br/>\n&gt;should rethink that. Ok how many 49&#39;s? About 200 again. How many 48&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt;300. How many 47&#39;s ? About 300 and so and so on. How many 46+ zones ? The<br/>\n&gt;planes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>\n&gt;spawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>\n&gt;and clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>\n&gt;planes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>\n&gt;plane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>\n&gt;spawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to.
