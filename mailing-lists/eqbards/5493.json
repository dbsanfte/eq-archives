I many times after spending some time with a person<br/>\nonline form a picture in my mind of what they sound like and what sort of<br/>\naccent they might have.  Its amazing how ridiculously far off I usually am<br/>\nin the few times I have actually spoken to the person later.  Its a lot of<br/>\nfun being grouped with three Japanese players for 4 hours and being the odd<br/>\nman out for a change.  It was a lot of fun and we all struggled to<br/>\ncommunicate at one time or another.  Still the exchange of info and playing<br/>\nstyles was invaluable.  They were all fascinated to find that one of my<br/>\nfavorite sites was Quesstor&#39;s since it is in Japanese for the most part.  I<br/>\ntold them I was sad I couldn&#39;t read all the info but the maps were the<br/>\ncoolest I&#39;d ever seen.  Much like the meticulous hand drawn maps my<br/>\ncharacter would purchase in the game if he could!<br/>\nOn a side note, for some reason I always pictured you with a southern drawl<br/>\nRebecca.  Mine has softened a bit living in the Rockies, but when I get mad<br/>\nor excited it still comes out.  What part of the south are you from?  I came<br/>\nfrom Virginia, but have lived in Miami and South Carolina.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:macha_nabaob@...\">macha_nabaob@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 10:37 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Second Language<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rebecca Small&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:macha_nabaob@...\">macha_nabaob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love meeting players from other countries! I can sometimes spot them per <br/>\nenglish skills but most times not, ingame. Then its the &#39;where are you, <br/>\nanway?&#39; routine. We have several Eurpoeans in our guild but only 1 is <br/>\nusually on at anything remotely like our American play hours. I have run <br/>\ninto the odd Japanese ocassionally on Xegony during our play hours but their<br/>\n<br/>\nmain continent is logging about the time we are getting started. We also <br/>\nhave a few French Canadians in our guild. You would think Canadians would be<br/>\n<br/>\nvery close to Americans but not always. The thing that will trip you up <br/>\nfastest with folks of different countries is culture references. Sometimes <br/>\nits harmless:<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild wizard (american) meets guild barbarian warrior (canadian) for the <br/>\nfirst time:<br/>\nWiz: You look like Peter Rabbit in that horned helm!<br/>\nBarb: Umm, who is Peter Rabbit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI always take it as a new opportunity to learn things. We are going to try <br/>\nout the BattleField Communicator this week and the Canadian is already <br/>\nworried about his speaking English and accent. And then there&#39;s me with my <br/>\nSouthern Drawl.
