I remember when<br/>\nit was pretty friendly and we all shared info.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have better things to do with my time than read flames on my sig line (of<br/>\nall things) which started as a joke between me and an old friend who I<br/>\ngrouped with regularly during Beta.  He always used to jokingly call me the<br/>\n&quot;Bard of Norrath&quot; because of the stories I&#39;d tell him while we played.<br/>\nStories I gleaned from websites, both official and fan.  Stories I made up<br/>\nabout people like Dorn B&#39;dyn and other NPC&#39;s we would encounter.  We<br/>\noriginally met in Beta 2 and became very close friends.  A few months after<br/>\nfinal started he vanished from the game and I heard no more from him for a<br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI eventually found out, from his wife, that he had died in an automobile<br/>\naccident caused by a drunk driver.  I have since left my signature as &quot;Bard<br/>\nof Norrath&quot; in honor of his &quot;half joking&quot; name for me and since I knew him<br/>\nin Beta 2 It was &quot;Bard of Norrath since Beta 2&quot; to honor his memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was the one who had convinced me to become a guide though I did<br/>\neventually retire when things got too crazy in my life.<br/>\nHe was the one who kept me playing in Final even though I had the &quot;Been<br/>\nthere, seen that&quot; attitude.<br/>\nHe helped me re-discover my joy of Norrath.<br/>\nHe will live forever in my thoughts as one of the kindest souls I know.<br/>\nHe will remain, for eternity, one of my truest friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for the foul language in my last post but that comment by Shada<br/>\nand Blitz Krieg just really hurt.  I hope you can understand.  It&#39;s not<br/>\n_just_ a game when real people&#39;s feelings are involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin L.
