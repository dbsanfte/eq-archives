If you&#39;re having problems in Blackburrow you<br/>\nreally need to consider upgrading your system.  The lag there should be<br/>\nminimal, if any.  If you&#39;re having that kind of problem in Blackburrow I<br/>\ndread to think how bad kunark is going to be for you :(  Might want to<br/>\nconsider picking up a TNT 2 Ultra with 32mb ram.  You can get them for a<br/>\nsong these days (around $70-$150) and maybe some more ram for your computer<br/>\n(128mb ram is great for EQ)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some helpful hints.  If you&#39;re having that much trouble with BB I&#39;d<br/>\nsuspect your system is kind of lower-end.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
