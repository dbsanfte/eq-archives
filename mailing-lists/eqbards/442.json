You have to be in windowed mode,<br/>\nnot full screen.  Then you can drag and drop spell buttons just like other<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>\n&gt;song to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>\n&gt;doing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.  I<br/>\n&gt;should have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>\n&gt;usually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right.  Trust your instincts.  You will probably know more about your songs<br/>\nthan any non-bard and maybe more about them then most bards, since you<br/>\nfrequent this group!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and Learn!)<br/>\n&gt;Getting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amen and amen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeyeon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
