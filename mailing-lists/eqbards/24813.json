Perm is so far out of<br/>\nthe way it&#39;s a major effort for a small guild like mine to sponsor a raid.<br/>\nAny organizing is especially hard since I play late hours PST when the<br/>\nXegony pop drops to under 1500 or even 1000.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last time I participated in a Naggy raid no scales dropped :(.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I&#39;m seriously thinking of moving on and getting back into some<br/>\nXP grouping. And now that charm is nerfed I want twilight so I can again<br/>\nbe a CC asset.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad we don&#39;t have a voting tool on this list. Would be interesting to<br/>\nsee how many people think it&#39;s still worth it to wait around.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch &quot;prob losing chance for Naggy drums&quot; Minstrel<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger  wrote: Assuming the raid leader know what he/she is doing<br/>\nthere is no reason for aVox/Naggy raid to fail.  The melee damage output<br/>\nwith kunark/sov weapons isso much higher than what those 2 were tuned for.<br/>\n Not to mention these raidsoften have access to high level buffsThe<br/>\nproblem (at least on the raids I went to) is that the munchkin mob hashad<br/>\nenough time to get to 50 now.  Obviously there were lvl 50 idiots<br/>\nprekunark, but they were less and often easily identifible (from what I<br/>\nwashearing at that time).  Now they have Sebillis keys.When I went on my<br/>\nfirst Vox raid, I sat there silently, in terror that Iwould screw<br/>\nsomething up.  I turned off guild chat and told all my friendsto not send<br/>\nme tells.  I asked this list and the high level bards (I think Isent you a<br/>\ntell Sartori, hehehe) what I should be doing.I am not talking about a<br/>\nyoung guild/ coalition making an honest attempt atVox and failing here.  I<br/>\nadmire people who try new (to them) things.  I amtalking about a vetran<br/>\nraid leader who can&#39;t get enough competent playerswho merely listen to him<br/>\nto kill a old world dragon.  I am talking peoplewho blantantly ignore the<br/>\ndirections given to them by the raid leader.Theres nothing hard about<br/>\nunderstanding &quot;DO NOT BUFF YOUR PARTY.  NO ONESHOULD HAVE ANY BUFFSIF YOU<br/>\nHAVE BUFFS, DISPEL THEM.&quot;  Theres nothing hardabout &quot;Do not send me tells<br/>\nabout loot, the looting rules were made publicbefore the raid and will be<br/>\nrepeated before we make groups.&quot; There isnothing hard about &quot;Do not move<br/>\npast me, if you fall in a pit or agro a mob,especially Vox, do not try to<br/>\nrun, just stand there and die, we will rezyou.&quot;/rant offElfson Allegro 55<br/>\nVeeshanYahoo!
