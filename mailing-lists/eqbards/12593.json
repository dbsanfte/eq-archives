I was camping in sage<br/>\nroom on my level 50 necro and my pet was duel wielding some 19 and 20 dly<br/>\ndaggers. Out pops the scribe and gets a  charm on my pet. That was scary he<br/>\nbeat the crap out of me and then there was a level 49 pet runing around in<br/>\nguk. The thing with pets is once charmed always charmed.

I wanted to stop by and see if Najena was<br/>\n&gt;camped. Being the nutcase that I am, I hit lullaby,<br/>\n&gt;(my magic AE door opener.) and find a full spawn.<br/>\n&gt;Well, I could fight, or I could die, so I decided to<br/>\n&gt;play. I charm magician #1 and sicc her on Najena,<br/>\n&gt;while I twist guardian. All the mobs aggro on her<br/>\n&gt;(including her own pet) she dies quick. One pulse of<br/>\n&gt;charm and the pet suicides. Charm mage #2, sicc her on<br/>\n&gt;Najena too. She dies, of course, and I charm the pet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Najena was tougher. I was going to fear/chain her, but<br/>\n&gt;it didn&#39;t work too well. I ended up meleeing her,<br/>\n&gt;while pixie&#39;ing like mad. She got 2 spells off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All said and done, I nearly died. I was somewhere<br/>\n&gt;around 1 bubble after all this fun, and not willing to<br/>\n&gt;chance it again. (Damn froglok ghoul almost killed me<br/>\n&gt;on the way out.) Any advice on how to do this better<br/>\n&gt;next time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Double Entendre<br/>\n&gt;Bard of 29 &quot;Sorry, no clarity yet&quot;&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
