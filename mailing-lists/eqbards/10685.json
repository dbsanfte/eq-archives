It seems that every class has major gripes and<br/>\nwhat REALLY is wrong is level 35 and up?  Besides, don&#39;t forget Selo.  I<br/>\njust traded for my MM drums and I&#39;m FLYING.  I would imagine the twisting<br/>\nsome magic resist songs will never become useless, and I planning on<br/>\ntwisting heal and mana when I hit 32...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, my brother&#39;s first encounter with the Predator yielded an<br/>\nobsidian shard which I thoroughly enjoyed for days... then some darn level<br/>\n50 shaman gave me an offer for it I couldn&#39;t refuse: an obsidian scimitar,<br/>\nan obsidian hoop, a chipped bone bracelet, a +4 wis +4 dex? veil, and 200<br/>\nplat.  I immediately turned around and traded the obsidian hoop to another<br/>\nlevel 50 for azure sleeves and gave the veil, sleeves, and bracelet to my<br/>\nbrother&#39;s druid.  The scimitar is decent, but I miss my shard!  I never saw<br/>\nany stamina loss when I was duel wielding my dragoon dirk and the shard.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to camp the predator now for the last 3 nights and haven&#39;t<br/>\nseen anything but place holder spawns.  Anyone have advice on how to get the<br/>\npredator to spawn?<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 28th song (sliver from 29!)<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 29, 1999 3:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Great post on item balancing (Long)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At times I wish I could hit as hard as my wife&#39;s warrior, or do crowd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control as well as my buddy&#39;s enchanter, or snare as well as my<br/>\n&gt; brother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; druid or friend&#39;s ranger, or buff as well as my friend&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; shaman...  but who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else can do it ALL?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You will certainly do it all later on in your career. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Your chains wont matter, your charm doesnt work anymore, pixie<br/>\n&gt;   strike doesnt hold monsters well enough, you are like a mosquito<br/>\n&gt;   pricking the enemy with your tiny axe and dirk, and people will<br/>\n&gt;   say &quot;why am I going beserk - what is a burst of strength/speed?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   Lullaby?
