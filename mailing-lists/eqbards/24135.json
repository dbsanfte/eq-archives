It is a str/dex/AC buff which stacks with pretty much every buff<br/>\nspell out there.  There are times where you will best serve your group by<br/>\nbanging away Chant of Battle on your Bongos...<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 2: CHords of discord:<br/>\nArea of effect DOT song.  Greatly enhanced by using a stringed instrument.<br/>\nYou will actually find this song more useful once you get to lvl 18 and want<br/>\nto do an all instruement attack with this, Hymm and the lvl 18 AOE DOT.  It<br/>\ndamages scale well, and eventually it comes close to the damage of the<br/>\nhigher lvl DOT songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 52 Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
