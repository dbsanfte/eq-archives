On the other hand, the few<br/>\n&gt;times I&#39;ve whipped out my Kisch, I think I&#39;ve had 100% resists<br/>\n&gt;against its poison proc (which is almost<br/>\n&gt;never resisted on Antonica).  Perhaps it is the type of the Kunark<br/>\n&gt;mob you are fighting?  Perhaps too it<br/>\n&gt;is charisma related.  Currently I&#39;m up to a whopping 160 unbuffed now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Perhaps a Princess...&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You are very lucky.
