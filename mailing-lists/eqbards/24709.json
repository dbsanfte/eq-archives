Seems to me a poor exploit tho, especially since we pay for a 39th lvl charm with mana and that charm has no enhancements over song of sirens  and the only benefit is that, we can continue to do something we&#39;ve been doing for 12 lvls...<br/>\n<br/>\n    John Grady &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n  That is ridiculous.
