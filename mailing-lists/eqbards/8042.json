If not this can<br/>\nreally save your skin so get him to.  Also with the druid/ranger combo send the<br/>\nrangers (sow&#39;ed) to pull for the group, and have the warrior & other ranger stand<br/>\nso the MOB&#39;s will have to go through tanks to get to the bards.  This way the MOB<br/>\nwill get attacked by tanks & may forget about you.  You might also see if druid can<br/>\nlull a few before pull.  Also make sure that non-melee&#39;er &quot;help&quot; the tank take out<br/>\none of the MOB&#39;s when they aren&#39;t casting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for songs, I don&#39;t see if you were using inst & h2h or singing & weapons during<br/>\nthe battle.  I would try experimenting w/ using weapons vs. insts.  W/ two bards if<br/>\nyou are both using inst decide who will use drum & who lute.  The lute should play<br/>\nHymn and Chords (start twist w/ Chord just before MOB reach party & they will &quot;run<br/>\ninto&quot; your song).  The other bard w/ drum should do Anthem/Elemental (or Selo&#39;s if<br/>\na real long battle) till you get 12th, then the Anthem/Bellow twist.  The bard<br/>\nusing the lute will be the most popular, so you may want to stop & switch<br/>\nsongs/inst to even out damage between bards.  If not have druid save enough mana to<br/>\ndo 1 or 2 heals on bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We tried the camp a total of three times, some of us dying every time.<br/>\n&gt; There were(I think) 5 bandits, all blue, except for one, which was yellow.<br/>\n&gt; The first time I had the misfortune to be playing Hymn twisted with Anthem<br/>\n&gt; from the beginning of the fight, and I ended up with three bandits on me due, I<br/>\n&gt; think to Hymn. Needless to say, I died. It was a fun run of shame back to<br/>\n&gt; my body...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The second time we tried it, we were actually jumped -- a pair of<br/>\n&gt; bandits running by started the fray, and the five from the camp<br/>\n&gt; joined the fun. This time the other Bard was killed; he was playing<br/>\n&gt; Hymn. When I noticed his health dropping rapidly, I told him to back<br/>\n&gt; off, and he did, but the bandits didn&#39;t stop. Is there anything I could<br/>\n&gt; have done to pull them off of him?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The third time, again there were 7 bandits. A ranger shot at a bandit<br/>\n&gt; in the camp and those 5 ran at us, and two more running by at the same<br/>\n&gt; time joined the fray. This time, I decided to use Discord, rather then Hymn<br/>\n&gt; to try to do extra damage. I liked seeing 7 messages &quot;a bandit winces&quot;! But<br/>\n&gt; once again, I managed to get the attention of a pair of bandits, and died. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; asked the other Bard to play Elemental Rhythms, as there was a yellow bandit<br/>\n&gt; caster in the camp.  He died also, I&#39;m really not sure why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This time I grabbed my spare drum to make the run back a little faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anybody have any suggestions of how I could have survived the first and<br/>\n&gt; last fight, and kept the rest of the party alive also?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep in mind that I&#39;m only level 11 -- so I&#39;m really not interested in<br/>\n&gt; hearing about<br/>\n&gt; songs that are higher levels(at least until I get there :).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All in all, I had fun, but it was a loosing night for me and experience. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
