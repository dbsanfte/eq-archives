I find I&#39;m of two minds about begging.  I tend not to like it in<br/>\nmany cases, but for some of my characters it seems reasonable if done with<br/>\ndiscretion and in-character entertainment value.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I wouldn&#39;t even consider begging by broadcast, /ooc, /auc, or<br/>\n/shout.  That is a sure way to incite my use of /ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it comes to judgment and style.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m offended by /tell or /say with a request for money or items for a<br/>\nrandom newbie of just any race or class, in those terms, especially if<br/>\nthey&#39;re persistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand for a couple of my characters (both halflings), they&#39;re<br/>\nlikely to complement a person on their equipment and then say, &quot;Can I have<br/>\nit?&quot;  In their case it&#39;s an in-character sense of community property and<br/>\nlittle expectation of being given anything.  To be fair they will also<br/>\nsometimes give to others, even unsolicited.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy most outright case was walking my halfling warrior, my most likely<br/>\nbegger, into the Freeport bank and saying, &quot;Wow, can any of you rich folks<br/>\nspare a few odd platinum for a hard-working but poor warrior?  Equipment is<br/>\nreally expensive around here.&quot;  I only did that once.  It got me 10<br/>\nplatinum from a high-level, well-equipped halfling woman.  I went on a<br/>\ncareful, judicious spending spree, after of course complementing her beauty<br/>\nand generosity and promising to do good and be a mighty warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I kidding myself or is begging done skillfully and wisely a game<br/>\nenhancement but done coarsely (and as if you&#39;re owed) worthy of being /ignored?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
