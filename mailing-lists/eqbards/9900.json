There is this set of iron bars you need to raise to go<br/>\nthru and right there - i swear to the Gods that they have it drop your invis<br/>\n- on purpose!  There can be one or two gobs who went agro on me - maybe<br/>\nthere was one and he ran and got his buddy - but thank the Gods there were<br/>\n2. I charmed one and made them fite.  I dont think i could have taken one by<br/>\nmyself in a pure melee. And the fear of a train had me real scared. I really<br/>\nreally hate getting killed by greenies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice to you is try to tag along with a group going in and out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 35th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 7:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Lambent Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am headed tonight to get the Icy Greaves from Permafrost.
