I am sure they test things before<br/>\nthey publish the change to everyone.  But they can&#39;t test it such that the<br/>\nresults are completely predictable for all clients.  Example: they just did<br/>\nsomething with a spell called &quot;Ensnare&quot; It was supposed to last longer than<br/>\na regular snare.  But after it was released - it became known - thru player<br/>\ntesting that it was not performing correctly.  So, the spell guy looked into<br/>\nit and made a change.  Do you think he just released it without testing<br/>\nit??? No.  But even though he tested - it was not until a general release<br/>\nthat it became known that there was a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.... it&#39;s very possible that the recent change to missed notes on high<br/>\nlevel songs is related to something they changed BUT it does NOT affect<br/>\neveryone.  Example: I do not notice any more missed note than before.  I am<br/>\na low level player (just made 20) and don&#39;t own and so have never memorized<br/>\nor played the songs that had the missed note problem they were(are) trying<br/>\nto fix.  MAYBE it only affects players who have the &quot;missed note&quot; songs that<br/>\nthey were trying to fix???<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like the missed note problem affects some but not others.  Perhaps<br/>\nthis is a clue towards getting it fixed?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tChris Kuenster (Entex)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, August 11, 1999 8:09 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Missed Notes<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tLook, I for one am getting tired of the nay-sayers on this<br/>\nmissed note<br/>\n\t\tthing. Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I<br/>\nmissed notes 10 times<br/>\n\t\tin a row and finally erased it from my list and added a<br/>\ndifferent song. ALL<br/>\n\t\tmy skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is<br/>\n110, there is a<br/>\n\t\tproblem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has<br/>\nchanged with the<br/>\n\t\tway I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont<br/>\nhave a clue<br/>\n\t\twhat your talking about. This is a very serious problem in<br/>\nhow the Bard is<br/>\n\t\tplayed, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to<br/>\neffectively. I cannot<br/>\n\t\tdepend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to.<br/>\nIn fact I find<br/>\n\t\tmyself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that<br/>\nhotkey waiting to<br/>\n\t\tpush it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play<br/>\nenough to notice a<br/>\n\t\thuge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice<br/>\nit, but dont tell<br/>\n\t\tus we are imagining things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Keith G.
