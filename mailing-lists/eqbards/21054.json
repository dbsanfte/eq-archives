The range is so small that <br/>\n&gt; even manually<br/>\n&gt; following the bard is near impossible with lag (warping included)<br/>\n&gt; especially with SoW.  The only thing that it seems to be good <br/>\n&gt; for (IMHO) is<br/>\n&gt; keeping the dungeon trash off the people who are meditating.  <br/>\n&gt; And when you<br/>\n&gt; are running around solo.  It would be nice if Verant <br/>\n&gt; increased the range,<br/>\n&gt; but I am sure we all know about Verant&#39;s priorities concerning bards.<br/>\n&gt; /em sighs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 05:19 PM 8/23/00 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now that I can play Clouding, I tried using it while travelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt;through Firiona Vie with my Shaman husband.
