It was<br/>\npart<br/>\n  of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over casting that broke bards.<br/>\n  All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one that got people killed.<br/>\n  No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse had to stop the song and<br/>\n  then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of duration<br/>\n  beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a long drop<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would<br/>\nnot<br/>\n  proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a week or so to<br/>\nfix.<br/>\n  The lists go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster<br/>\nrecasting.<br/>\n  However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that dictates how high you can go<br/>\nin<br/>\n  a specific area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Wed, 30 May 2001 10:50:11 -0500 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to do with Selos<br/>\n  and<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells before they ran<br/>\n  out;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; which made the levitate higher - so they could use multiple casts to<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; recasting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE<br/>\n(and<br/>\n  I<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it<br/>\nran<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; out and you fell.

Literally 19 seconds of testing<br/>\n  would have<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; caught this bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc). In this<br/>\n  case<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They admitted it was a<br/>\nbug -<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or<br/>\nmore<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Slyde<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 10:01 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them.
