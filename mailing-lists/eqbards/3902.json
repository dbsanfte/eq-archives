One of the<br/>\ncharacteristics of EverQuest that I find most annoying is how software<br/>\nfeatures and bugs mislead you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe /con system purports to be a way of deciding whether to attempt a fight<br/>\nbased on some sense of your chance of winning.  You&#39;re saying that is a<br/>\nweaker part of the rule than using it as a measure of what XP reward you&#39;ll<br/>\nget.  Your analysis sounds correct, and I feel like I was blind-sided by<br/>\nsoftware, lack of documentation, and lack of communication skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fine to be misled in game, but Verant&#39;s sloppyness fosters the sort of<br/>\nwild mix of in-game and out-of-game mechansims that we all use to various<br/>\ndegrees and unfortunately pushes strongly in the direction of playing the<br/>\nsoftware instead of living in the virtual world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
