The 3 or 4 of us were 50 and 51<br/>\n(Kunark just out) and we did ok as long as we worked slowly.  But at one<br/>\npoint, we got a few too many of them angry and we had to evac.  I notice<br/>\nthat you are 36 and possibly some others in your raid were similar levels.<br/>\nThis could be why you had some difficulty.  The social range of mobs is<br/>\ndirectly linked to player levels.  Even so, the social range in that dungeon<br/>\nand that spot is some thing to contend with.  I used lament to try to reduce<br/>\nthe social ranges on all my pulls so that we could fight as few as possible.<br/>\nAnd finally, there are a series of &quot;names&quot; in the library (3 or 4) and<br/>\n&quot;nearly three hours&quot; might not be long enough to cycle through all of them.<br/>\nAlso, you may not have seen him on tracking if other mobs had filled your<br/>\nlist and there was no room for him - sometimes I see mobs on my screen that<br/>\nare not on my tracking list.  The tambourine is a fine item and worth going<br/>\nback for another attempt - good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bill Costlow&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 26, 2001 4:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Kaesora help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; I am looking for my last coin to the Nostrolo Tamborine quest and it&#39;s in<br/>\nKaesora.  Had a guild raid down there last night that ended in tragedy.  We<br/>\nwere constantly overwhelmed by mobs down there -- most of the night we had<br/>\n10 players in the courtyard.  Many deaths -- had a 50th lvl paladin pulling<br/>\nbut that didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>\n&gt; Worst of all, in nearly three hours of camping the library I never did see<br/>\na failed crypt raider on track.  Please give me some advice for the next<br/>\nsortee.<br/>\n&gt; Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 36 missed notes </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
