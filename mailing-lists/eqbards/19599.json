Certainly less than whatever a Lambent stone sells<br/>\nfor.  They are useless to anyone except bards and I dont think th emerchants<br/>\nwill pay very much if anything for them.  You just have to find folks who<br/>\nhave the coins - or go kill the mobs yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complete the quest, you do need to give a Star of Odus to the banker guy.<br/>\nIt sells for about 150pp in Erudin.  he gives you the no drop container that<br/>\nyou combine the coins in and return to him for the Nostrolo tambourine.  I<br/>\nonly need to get the Royal Crown coin from Dalnirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen to Kaesora 2 times - got that coin both times.  The failed raider<br/>\nshould show up with 2 hours pretty easily.  We got some other trinkets<br/>\nclearing our way into & around the library: war/pal/shd 2hs, rogue dagger,<br/>\ntruesilver helm & bracer, int+ mask - good stuff for the level of the<br/>\ndungeon.  We were all too old for it (except our 40 clr who saw only a<br/>\ncouple greens.) Even so, you need to be careful as you can get a swarm of<br/>\ngreenies with a bad pull or accidental agro.  We had a evac person both<br/>\ntimes and had to do in combat evac once.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Daryl Schwemley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drs@...\">drs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 09, 2000 2:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] MM Drum misadventure and Nostrolo Tamborine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of these coins, if you had to buy them, how much would you expect<br/>\n&gt; to pay for them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gilgurth<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 24 Winces<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
