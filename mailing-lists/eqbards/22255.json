Our <br/>\n&gt; guild&#39;s ogre warrior<br/>\n&gt; has been tracking his average damage per hit for some time <br/>\n&gt; now.  Apparently<br/>\n&gt; if he is grouped with any group not including another <br/>\n&gt; warrior, or a ranger,<br/>\n&gt; or a rogue, or a monk, or a paladin, he inflicts 15% more damage on an<br/>\n&gt; average per hit basis than he does when there is another one <br/>\n&gt; of those types<br/>\n&gt; in the group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had a chance to check his numbers yet, but I did <br/>\n&gt; observe that he<br/>\n&gt; rarely hits for over 80 when grouped with myself and a <br/>\n&gt; ranger.  When grouped<br/>\n&gt; with just myself against the same mobs he often hit for over 80 and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes even 100 without criticals.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anybody heard of anything like this before?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eLerts<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
