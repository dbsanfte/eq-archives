They never did that before, that I can<br/>\n  tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>\n  I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>\n  high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>\n  correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>\n  over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>\n  (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
