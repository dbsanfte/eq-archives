He was looking<br/>\nfor a Mryolkar (sp?) BP. I thought to myself of course, don&#39;t we all?<br/>\n(sarcasm)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told me that while passing through EJ one day, he was observing a guild<br/>\ngetting smeared by Severilious. It was actually a close battle, so he said.<br/>\nI suppose their last dragon hunter fell to the ground, he walked up and<br/>\nnuked (not on his rogue) the poor cute little dragon to its death. Lo and<br/>\nbehold, 2 dragonscales. I have no idea what he decided to do with the other<br/>\nitems that dropped, if any. But I suppose it does happen in some far off<br/>\ngalaxies sometimes. Bards never get solo dragon kills :-( hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
