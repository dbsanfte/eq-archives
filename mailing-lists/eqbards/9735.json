The mobs will<br/>\nvary in level such that when she is first trying this the higher ones will<br/>\nresist and go agro when hit with the song.  When you first get the song it<br/>\nis not as strong as it will be in even 2 more levels. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than tell her to lament them all without regard to their con nor the<br/>\norder in which you apply the song, I suggest lamenting from the lower con to<br/>\nthe higher con.  And like they say - learn about agro radius of mobs and how<br/>\nto avoid pulling thru - even lamented mobs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

I also try to lament the farther mobs and<br/>\npull the other so it doesn&#39;t run right thru the lamented ones, possibly<br/>\nactivating them.  This has been almost universally successful for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
