Plus I&#39;m one of those people that never quite got the hang of <br/>\nusing hotkeys for songs.  I&#39;m pretty much stuck on the old mouse for <br/>\ntwistings, which makes it a little harder to switch songs/instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m in a caster-heavy group, I will equip Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine and <br/>\nchant.  If I&#39;m in a melee heavy group, I&#39;ll switch to weapons and swing with <br/>\nthe big boys with Celerity and 2 chants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then maybe it helps that I&#39;m usually in a good group and don&#39;t NEED to <br/>\nadd that little bit of extra damage...<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 47 Missed Notes<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
