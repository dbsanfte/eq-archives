There&#39;s a theory out there that blunt weapons do help in<br/>\ngetting pelts, and in getting good quality pelts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also heard from Verant that the loot held by mobs is<br/>\npredetermined when they spawn, not when they die (which is why you<br/>\ncan pickpocket a monster as much as you want).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I wonder why everytime I&#39;m auctioning &quot;WTB pelts&quot; the usual<br/>\nanswers come from monks and clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well.  Weight is a big issue for my character.  I travel with 4<br/>\nbackpacks, a spit, and a large sewing kit (just recently learned that<br/>\nsewing kits only weigh 1 lb  vs  backpack&#39;s 3 ... I might be selling<br/>\nmy backpacks for large sewing kits soon).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was saying ... 4 backpacks, a spit, a large sewing kit, a set of<br/>\nthe 7 tailoring patterns (or whatever I need to complete sets in the<br/>\nbank), short beer & spices (beer braised, yum), my trusty scimitar,<br/>\nmandolin, hand drum, milk and muffins.  I run around E. Commons<br/>\nlooking for anything with a pelt.  Now and then I run across an orc<br/>\npawn or a fire beetle, which I dispatch with a quick hack and an<br/>\nactivation of dissonance.  Pelts and weapons (not orc picks) quickly<br/>\nget my weight up, which is why I would rather hunt in cloth (or the<br/>\nnude) instead of wearing patchwork, leather, or banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll buy a full set of leathers (I think it&#39;s lighter than patchwork,<br/>\nno?)  and see if the damage absorbtion decreases my downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
