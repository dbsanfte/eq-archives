But, I know Verant has<br/>\npeople who are not happy about the way bind id even now much less giving any<br/>\nmore people the ability.  So...<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here&#39;s a proposal to consider.  No new classes get the ability to bind.<br/>\nEveryone has the same rules for binding.  Casters can bind in the cities as<br/>\nthey do now.  Casters can bind anyone in any zone but only if they use a<br/>\nreagent.  More specifically the reagent should be one that is either<br/>\nexpensive, or requires obtaining in some non-plat related way such as a<br/>\nspecial forage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would solve the binding availability problem to some degree as well as<br/>\nsolving the problem of forcing people to run naked all over Norrath just<br/>\nbecause they aren&#39;t a caster.  Also make some zones unbindable period.  No<br/>\none can bind in Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  Now you won&#39;t have to make that dragon so<br/>\nhard cause when a caster dies he ain&#39;t just memming and running around the<br/>\ncorner to blast away.  Now he has to figure out how t get past al the weenie<br/>\ncritters naked.  Obviously those weenie critters would squish my poor little<br/>\nbard but to a guy takin&#39; on Nagafen they&#39;re weenie critters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
