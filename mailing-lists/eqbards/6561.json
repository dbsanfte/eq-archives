I was a<br/>\nshish-kebob machine doing 10 damage with Pugius and 12 damage with Dragoon<br/>\nDirk for as much as 22 straight melee damage about every 2.2 seconds.  The<br/>\nSilvery War Axe that fetches 400pp on the PC market has an attack delay of<br/>\n22 and damage 6 vs the Pugius&#39; delay 21 damage 5 and they weigh the same.<br/>\nThe Bladed Thulian Claws have an attack delay of 19 and damage of 5.  Pugius<br/>\nis an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>\nwith piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is this weapon found?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>\nUnrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>\ntold they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I see<br/>\nanyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?
