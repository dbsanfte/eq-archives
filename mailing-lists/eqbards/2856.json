At that point, I&#39;m gonna change my hot boxes to<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPrimary Hand (with Combine)<br/>\n\tSecondary Hand (with Dirk)<br/>\n\tInventory slot 1 (with lute)<br/>\n\tInventory slot 2 (with drum)<br/>\n\tRanged weapon (empty)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen to swap to an intrument, move the Dirk to the ranged weapon slot,<br/>\npick up the Combine and exchange it with an instrument, then put the<br/>\ninstrument in the Secondary hand...<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo benefits to this, one being I still get the Dirk bonuses when<br/>\nI&#39;ve got an instrument equipped, and second, I don&#39;t have to worry<br/>\nabout accidently filling the required top-level empty invnetory<br/>\nbox I needed previously for instruemnt swapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is assuming I ever get my Piercing skill up to snuff.  I need to<br/>\nfind somewhere quiet with blue critters about to practice on, since<br/>\nin populated areas people keep trying to &quot;save&quot; me... heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
