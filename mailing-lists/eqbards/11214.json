The<br/>\n&gt;question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>\n&gt;abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>\n&gt;had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>\n&gt;(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>\n&gt;would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>\n&gt;a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
