Campbell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cathyc@...\">cathyc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings all, I am the wood-elf Kendrin, bard of the 4th rank, in<br/>\nKelethin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question regarding the quest given by Sylia Windlehands -- how<br/>\nmany times can you do it?  Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>\nquest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>\ntimes, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need<br/>\nstrings?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>\nto locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrin<br/>\n(Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
