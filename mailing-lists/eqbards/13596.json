As currently implemented, EQ is an advancement-based<br/>\n&gt;game.  After you hit the top level, there is little to do<br/>\n&gt;besides the same thing over and over to get more stuff.  UO<br/>\n&gt;(even with its faults) gets around the problem by being more<br/>\n&gt;of a social game - there are lots of new things you can do<br/>\n&gt;once you max out all your skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now that the ranks of L50 players are growing, Verant is<br/>\n&gt;having to come to terms with this problem.  The expansion will<br/>\n&gt;only delay the problem, not solve it.  If the level cap is<br/>\n&gt;raised to 75, they&#39;ll run into the same problem when people<br/>\n&gt;start to hit L75.  (And now you know why I think it&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt;stupid to buy a L50 character on EBay. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Btw, if the poll on the Everlore site is accurate, L45-50<br/>\n&gt;players make up about 6% of the playerbase.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
