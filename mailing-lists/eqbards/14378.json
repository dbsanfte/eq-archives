I&#39;ve brought this up before<br/>\n  and I love listening to people&#39;s take on what it really means.<br/>\n  I&#39;ve started conversations with group members in the king room<br/>\n  which have lasted hours about the meaning behind the pantings.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After we talk about the various meanings, I would like to submit<br/>\n  the pictures and comments onto a website which we can ask Verant<br/>\n  to look at and maybe /chuckle at; then give us the &#39;real&#39; intent<br/>\n  or meaning behind the scenes.  There is a story afoot, and I&#39;d like<br/>\n  to know what that story is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It would be in the true spirit of bards to want to pursue such<br/>\n  storytelling in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nValentine&#39;s Day Shopping Made Simple.
