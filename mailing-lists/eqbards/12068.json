If you&#39;re facing one mob, the damage<br/>\nshield (7-8 points) is going to be activated 0-4 times every 3<br/>\nseconds (figure 2 average).  So over 6 seconds, the damage<br/>\nshield will do up to 64 points damage (32 average).  If all<br/>\nyour party members are wounded, Hymn is going to do (6-7)*6 =<br/>\n36-42 points healing every 6 seconds.  If you switch to a<br/>\nlute, healing 6 people at once easily outdoes the damage a<br/>\nshield would do against a mob quad-attacking every 3 seconds.<br/>\nSo it really depends on the situation.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidently, this is why I started playing with the Chant songs<br/>\nlately (they stack).  They seemed to do (16-18)*3 damage each<br/>\nto a mob per application.  That&#39;s roughly on par with the<br/>\ndamage I do with my weapons per Chant.  I didn&#39;t feel I was<br/>\nlosing much offensive power putting away my weapons and<br/>\nsticking with instruments + Chant of Flame.  Especially in<br/>\nlight of the druid tossing out Starfires like there was no<br/>\ntomorrow (1-2 per mob, about 30 seconds downtime between mobs)<br/>\nwith Clarity plus manastone plus Hymn on my lute.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   dmg (shield) or indirect dmg (healing) - neither of the two<br/>\n&gt;   will really make a single mob battle any quicker.
