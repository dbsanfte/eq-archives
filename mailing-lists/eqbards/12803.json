If I&#39;m in a mixed group, though, and a spawn has a common drop worth, say, 100pp or the<br/>\nequivalent that I can use, and a rare drop worth 1000pp that I cannot use, I still say I should be in the<br/>\nlotto for the rare drop.  I may not be able to use THAT item, but I can certainly use the 1000pp or the<br/>\ntrade equivalent.  Since I often have to stand in line for hours just to get into one group, I have to<br/>\nlive by their rules, though, which is one of the reasons I&#39;m so stinking poor.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 36 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
