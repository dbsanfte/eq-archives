Well after I charmed him and slaughtered a lot of goblins I decided<br/>\nto try something a little more... exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kicked on the jboots and lev song and slowly dragged the dino way out<br/>\ninto the ocean, back to the seafury island. Here I used him to slay Gornit,<br/>\nwho had a fine steel war hammer. I gave this too him and OMFG that was one<br/>\nbig hammer. But it made me realize that he could now dual wield. So I<br/>\ndropped Dixl and gave him a rusty rapier. I now had a level 50 pet hitting<br/>\nfor quad 137. I told him to attack a seafury, he killed it in under 40<br/>\nseconds. I killed a few more, incredible exp. Literally killing a seafury<br/>\nevery minute. Only taking a break every few clops to run around twisting<br/>\nhymn/niv to heal up from the occasional resist/mistake. I realized that the<br/>\nclop&#39;s were doing under 5% dmg to the dino, and that he probably could take<br/>\na lot more... So I started training the entire island. The dino was killing<br/>\nup to 5 clops at ONE time. I am solo mind you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept this up for about an hour, making nearly a bub of exp. I think went<br/>\nLD and lost half of it!  Oops. Serves me right I suppose, these kind of<br/>\ntactics are exactly the reason our charm song was capped at level 37 to<br/>\nbegin with and it most likely is not in my best interest to be exploiting<br/>\nthem. Err.. what am I saying. This tactic OWNS! Enjoy it while it lasts, I<br/>\ncringe at the thought of how little time it will take for the /feedbacks to<br/>\nstart about how over-powered bards are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
