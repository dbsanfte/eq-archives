If I turn the<br/>\nclipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>\nin viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>\nholding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>\nthe year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.
