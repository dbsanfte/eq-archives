This is a good<br/>\nexplanation of my point, and no it was not directed at Shada. As a<br/>\nfurther post to the list said, other than easy camps like the karnors<br/>\nzone line, high level play in Kunark requires near optimum groups unless<br/>\nyou want to spend a lot of time either evacing or doing CR, and in those<br/>\ngroups, the only effective way to play our class is reduced to being a<br/>\nmana/hp battery. Even then, the group _will_ have an enchanter, and<br/>\nclarity/clarity2 is enough that a bard becomes an expendable luxury<br/>\nwho&#39;s spot could easily be filled by someone who would make the group<br/>\nmore effective. I had great hopes that their reevaluation of lullaby<br/>\nmight let bards actually be an alternative to the enchanter, without<br/>\nwhich most groups wont go near places like Howling Stones or deep in<br/>\nSebilis, but as usual Verant doesn&#39;t want to give us that kind of power,<br/>\nleaving us ineffective there, as much as we are ineffective at slowing<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Sep 21/00, Mike Merck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmerck@...\">mmerck@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem is that most of us have already re-evaluated our<br/>\n&gt; playlists and determined that in 95% off all balanced groups, the most<br/>\n&gt; effective thing you can do is be a mana/hp battery. The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>\n&gt; song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>\n&gt; not just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>\n&gt; meleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>\n&gt; outcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>\n&gt; a movie.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sure, we still shine in broken, unbalanced groups, but those very same<br/>\n&gt; groups can&#39;t really &quot;get anything done&quot; in kunark. At least not when you<br/>\n&gt; compare them to groups that are balanced.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, yeah. It&#39;s their world. They make the rules. This doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\n&gt; people don&#39;t have the right to tell them that the rules they have made for<br/>\n&gt; the bard class squeeze the fun out of it at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nice come back.  That is exactly how I play (yea right)  What the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell does this bug fix have to do with the songs I play?  It actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forces me to rethink what songs I sing!  For instance, do I play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Celerity to get closer to max haste or do I play McVaxius?  In case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you missed something, this fix actually makes haste spell upgrades<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worth something!  (Does this sound like a movie watching mana bard?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think that you got it backwards.  Many of you think that this just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adds to the &quot;nerfing us to total mana batteries&quot;  BS!  This makes me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; re-evaluate my line up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S.
