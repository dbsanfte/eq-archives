Until this update I never had a<br/>\ndriver-related problem in EQ - (even with SB-Live that a lot of people have<br/>\nhad problems with).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOnce I installed 6.18 and went into EQ - it locked up.  The first time - I<br/>\ntried switching from weaps to Drum - and it locked when I put the drum in<br/>\nthe appropriate hand slot.  Rebooted, came back to EQ.  Then did a tell or<br/>\ntwo - and as soon as I tried to move forward - locked again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI had to revert to previous drivers (5.33) and no problems.  Beware<br/>\nupgrading drivers...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
