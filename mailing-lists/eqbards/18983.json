If I also melee hand to hand,<br/>\nthat seems to be enough of a taunt that I can garauntee a summons - even<br/>\nwith 2 SK&#39;s and a Rogue doing melee. So, I wait til near the end to h2h<br/>\nmelee while weaving the chants. When we rushed the emperor after pulling his<br/>\nguards out and killing them as singles, I played purifying and guardian with<br/>\nmy selos drum.  Even so, he could stick some low level disease on us<br/>\n(infectious cloud?).  Since that really didn&#39;t matter, on later rushes, I<br/>\nswitched to the 3 chants.  He resisted them so much, I switched to weapons<br/>\nand melee&#39;d him with Verses and Jig and whatever playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did this 8 or 10 times.  One time just as we are rushing the room, our<br/>\ncleric is saying &quot;really bad PL, really bad PL...&quot; and He goes LD very soon<br/>\nafter we atack the Emperor Chottal (60 necro?).  Emperor has a nice spectral<br/>\npet btw. Any how the enchanters tell us not to panic and start applying<br/>\nrunes as needed. I switch to lute and heal & niv&#39;s.  And somehow we managed<br/>\nto win. Now that was fairly exciting.  Deep in the first floor of Seb - no<br/>\nevac - no cleric and a named boss mob - heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it depends on where you are and who you are with and what is happening<br/>\nat the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.
