When<br/>\nthey went in to &quot;fix&quot; this and created our little z-axis bug, they really<br/>\nhad no way to effectively block mob&#39;s at different elevations or through<br/>\nfloors and walls from getting hit with songs/spell effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasicially what Verant would have to do is implement some sort of colission<br/>\ndetection code that would stop the songs effects from passing through the<br/>\nenironment where their are barriers (walls, floors). Of course if they got<br/>\nreally fancy they could try to model sound waves and how they would bounce<br/>\noff the surfaces. Imagine singing Denon&#39;s down a long echoing corridor!<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Snicker Furfoot, Esq. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 04, 1999 10:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Z-axis bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Snicker Furfoot, Esq.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Z-axis &quot;bug&quot; is in fact a required design flaw to prevent casters from<br/>\n&gt; easily whomping tanks.  Picture this, if you will: BigBlaster the caster<br/>\n&gt; levitates high over the head of Lockjaw.  Lockjaw, being melee-only, can<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; nothing but whine and complain, while BigBlaster laughs at him and pummels<br/>\n&gt; him repeatedly from the safety of his levitation.  With this Z-axis bug,<br/>\n&gt; melee-only critters can now hit levitators.  So, instead of taking out the<br/>\n&gt; one spell that caused the problem, they added 27 other new problems in<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies &quot;Peel me, I&#39;m an Orange!&quot; the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
