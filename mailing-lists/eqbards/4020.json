When play with a horn, str is increased by 30 points.  <br/>\nWhen play with MINO horn, flute, drum, lute, or weapons, str is increased by <br/>\n15 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is there any way we can get some confirmation about the minotaur horn&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;usage?  I have heard from some that it is only Wind, and now we have <br/>\n&gt;someone<br/>\n&gt;who claims it also works for Brass...can anyone confirm this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also have a question on this:  can you use the mino horn to raise the<br/>\n&gt;brass skill?  Currently my brass is maxed for my level, but I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt;lugging around a brass instrument just for this purpose, would be nice if I<br/>\n&gt;could sell it back to the vendor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I did try the song with the mino horn, and it does work.  But I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt;if its because I&#39;m singing it while just holding the horn, or if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;actually using the horn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The planet&#39;s eCenter for health & well-being.
