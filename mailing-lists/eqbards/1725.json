I really <br/>\nmuch doubt I won&#39;t.<br/>\nYou see, my image of Bards is more along the lines of a berzerking maniac <br/>\nsinging in battle as he or she hacks their way through a group of enemies, <br/>\na crazed grin on their faces as they chant out wild, skin-crawling songs <br/>\nlaced with arcane and guttural sounds that none else could hope to imitate. <br/>\nThe blood may splatter them, but they don&#39;t care. They&#39;ll laugh afterwards <br/>\nas they leap into a freezing stream (and drown like fools if they&#39;re <br/>\nwearing plate) to wash it all off. Then they&#39;ll sit down and eat, drink, <br/>\nrest and sing their warm, soothing melodies that somehow still maintain an <br/>\nedge to them, the very words the Bard pronounces throb with a very obvious <br/>\npower.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t quite fit Verant&#39;s image, but it&#39;s arguably close enough to not <br/>\nmake me a real-life plate-wearing fool. ;)<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tKimes, Dean W.

Its clear there is an<br/>\neasily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>\nimage of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>\nwhile sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have <br/>\na<br/>\nbazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>\nis moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me <br/>\nthat<br/>\nimage is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>\nthey&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>\nlight armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>\neven equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords, <br/>\nmagical<br/>\ninstruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem <br/>\nto<br/>\nhave items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>\nwe can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>\nlike a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>\ncould make better use of than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>\nThe way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>\nthey should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>\nwithout being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>\nminstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money,<br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>\n        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGive back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDeadline is June 19.
