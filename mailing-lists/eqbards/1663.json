All of them now hate you.  You are right it is a<br/>\nprogramming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this is seen when a party member gets bounced by a high level npc -<br/>\nlike brigand or a gryf.  Once one party member gets on a hate list all party<br/>\nmembers are added especially if you are playing a song that is buffing them<br/>\nor whatever.  So everyone has to zone to clear the hate list otherwise the<br/>\nmob will come hunting all of the party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still think better tactics can mitigate your situation.  Don&#39;t pull<br/>\nall of them (a cleric can lull some of them and you wont get 4 hitting on<br/>\nyou - only 2 :-) - I suppose your tanks don&#39;t mind because they can take all<br/>\nof them no problemo but all of them will attack you if you are in their<br/>\nsight.  Might be interesting to see just how far away you have to be before<br/>\nthey don&#39;t come to you instead of the tanks.  I know they will run around a<br/>\ncouple tanks if you are near but I wonder what would happen if you were<br/>\noutside of the range where you can read the icons?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone in your party have camo?  Does camo work if you are singing/playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tSam Zoucha [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:szoucha@...\">szoucha@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, June 08, 1999 9:16 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Utility of Lullaby and<br/>\nInvisibility songs<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Sam Zoucha &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:szoucha@...\">szoucha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAt 08:10 AM 6/9/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt;The bard helps all of the party.
