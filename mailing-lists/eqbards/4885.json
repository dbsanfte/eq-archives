My biggest dissapointment at becoming a bard in the beginning, went to<br/>\n&gt;buy a bow only to find we cannot use them.  I could care less that they are<br/>\n&gt;somewhat inefficient, I just wanted to be able to use one.  It fits into<br/>\n&gt;almost every concept of a bard in fantasy literature and games, but not in<br/>\n&gt;EQ?  Can&#39;t figure out why since it clearly is not unbalancing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually it can be very unbalancing.  You could stand outside of combat,<br/>\n&gt;play songs with an instrument and still be able to fire arrows into combat.<br/>\n&gt;Last I heard people were capable of doing 20+ dmg per arrow.  The trade off<br/>\n&gt;we make for having more effective songs when played is that we&#39;re out of<br/>\n&gt;combat and generally not doing direct damage (except of course<br/>\n&gt;bellow/discord/etc).  If we could use bows then there&#39;d be no decision to<br/>\n&gt;make as to sing or play songs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Funny thing is 7 is all I canthink of right offhand.  I still think bards<br/>\n&gt;are a great class, most of my gripes are little things.  I still hold to my<br/>\n&gt;feeling that I will never play another non-binding class however.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d have to concur, which is why I tend to laugh a bit when I see a bard<br/>\n&gt;petition being proposed.  There are much larger issues in the game, but<br/>\n&gt;still it&#39;s nice to have a concise list of what we see as problem areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt;Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.  <br/>\n&gt;For details, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
