Lots and lots<br/>\nof people have to now avoid a huge section of NK or Rathe so the bard<br/>\ncan keep an HG from dying for 30+ minutes while it tries to find another.<br/>\nIn the meantime, this HG pounds to crap out of anyone near death it<br/>\nfinds, another group sits around waiting for an HG to spawn to kill, while<br/>\nyou have yours, another group tries to kill this one that is no_where_near<br/>\nthe bard (not accusing you, just the ones I have seen).<br/>\n<br/>\nTry this:  In Rathe, you can make HGs spawn by killing the basilisks and<br/>\nskeletons and lizards.  Kill as many of these as you can until you see<br/>\nTWO HG pop.  Then go charm the two.  Don&#39;t grab one then wait for another.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Douglass Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My hobby lately has been the rush of HG hunting solo, problem, and you will<br/>\n&gt; laugh.... I need TWO, do you know how hard it is to find TWO Hill Giants<br/>\n&gt; twiddling thier Fee Fi Fo Thumbs now adays?  So as of late Ive been using a<br/>\n&gt; griffon instead, but the HG inevitably kills the Griffon...... and I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather get the Hill Giant.......... BTW this is a sight a blue flash zipping<br/>\n&gt; all over the countryside, circling around two HGs taunting them something<br/>\n&gt; fierce, all the /shouts, &quot;Whats that crazy Blue Bard doing&quot;? My biggest<br/>\n&gt; problem is some Druid deciding to Help me by peeling one off, then me<br/>\n&gt; recharming it away and saying &quot;STOP IT&quot;, all while dodging the other rather<br/>\n&gt; upset Hill Giant :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 30 Levels of Bardic hell and sacrifice...........<br/>\n&gt; 30+ Bards Rock :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jaez<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, December 13, 1999 3:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Simply Charming...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ok, so there I was in NK with nothing to do when I sees a Griffon.  Then I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sees another Girffon.  Hmm, well I can just zone if it goes bad.  So, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;target one and equip crude stein and sing charm:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your target is too far away...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your target is too far away...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you target is too far away...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you target is too far away...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[ nothing ]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[ nothing ]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[ nothing ]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your target resists the Song of the Sirens spell...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[ nothing ]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a grifon hits YOU for 64<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a grifon hits YOU for 64<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ruh roh!  Time to start moving.  So then as I am heading to the Plains of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Western Karana, I sees old Guard Frederick killing some corrupt lion<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I train Merv onto poor old Guard Fred.  Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Merv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and KS&#39;s him off me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;his tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low<br/>\n&gt; health<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- I guess that would have worked too.  I was in a risk adverse mood right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The day before - we tried to take a SG in S. Ro (we were after Kililji<br/>\n&gt; &gt;plans.)  A lo 30&#39;s bard and a lo 30&#39;s necro and me at 38.  Well, things got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all messed up and I was beat down to low hp and the other bard got killed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and I was running for the zone.  For some reason, pathing problem or what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not, the SG got a free tele port right to me from half way across the zone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hit, hit, dead. Ugh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;p.s. ya, I know I had been warned!
