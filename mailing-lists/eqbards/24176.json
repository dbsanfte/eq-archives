But, my intent with the change in topic is to <br/>\nfind out just what would be considered worthwhile for this song.  <br/>\nEveryone is saying it sucks.  What would make it _not_ suck.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nreally concerned with it making us overpowered in a non-uber raid <br/>\nenvironment... I want to find out what changes it would take for 90%+ <br/>\nof the Bards to mem this song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Make it DD rather than AE? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; we already have a targetted DD song at 55 (and 12 i guess heh).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What would be the point of ever memming our 55 BBB (except maybe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for the stun effect) if DDD was made single target?  Other than <br/>\nhaving 2 songs to cycle through, but who has 2 free song slots?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; well you answered your own previous question i guess heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of what I was thinking about as I wrote these suggested fixes <br/>\nwas the crappiness of BBB in comparison to the crappiness of DDD.  <br/>\nUsually a one target spell does more damage than AE.  Why would we <br/>\nget a song that does less damage, 12 levels later?  Sure, it has a <br/>\nshorter recast so the damage over time is _almost_ equal if you&#39;re <br/>\nonly hitting 2 targets with DDD.  But, it seems like they should have <br/>\nleft DDD where it was and increased the damage that BBB puts out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the numbers I heard were 20 mins sitting time, or 40 mins <br/>\nstanding time to regain 1 DDD load of mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
