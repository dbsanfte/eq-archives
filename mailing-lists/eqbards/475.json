That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>\npoint to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one<br/>\npractice point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense<br/>\nHeading, my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point<br/>\nspent and one skill level gained.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill<br/>\nlevels based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one<br/>\nskill level per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you<br/>\naccount for me getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1<br/>\npractice point?<br/>\n<br/>\nReason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>\nKelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>\nbrewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>\nprocess.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>\npoints in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoin the Star Wars craze!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nSet up your Star Wars list at ONElist.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
