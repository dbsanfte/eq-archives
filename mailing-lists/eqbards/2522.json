It is a leftover from the origin of this game in deep MUD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe true awkwardness here comes from game and program thinking rather than<br/>\nfantasy world thinking.  If you think in terms of game and program there<br/>\nare beings you can&#39;t kill, PCs, and beings you can (more or less), NPCs.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s a game artifact that impinges deeply on the fantasy world (for<br/>\nthose of us not player killers).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn live roleplaying or electronic I find it deeply disturbing to metagame<br/>\nand treat other beings very differently because I know they are PCs or<br/>\nNPCs.  I thus believe it is best to limit making that distinction to those<br/>\nsituations where you are talking about the game and not living the fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no appropriate in-game term because that distinction is not<br/>\nsupposed to exist any more than it must.  All NPCs aren&#39;t there to be prey.<br/>\n Recognizing an NPC as such isn&#39;t supposed to be the ultimate in underlying<br/>\nracism.  I believe that&#39;s the point of the faction system.  Actions have<br/>\nfar reaching consequences.  You can&#39;t kill with impunity.  Some dwarves are<br/>\nyour friends, some are not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
