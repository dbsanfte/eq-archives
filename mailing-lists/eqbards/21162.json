At least for those specific weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was my impression as well, so thats what Ive been using.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;To use the SSoY in your primary, and take advantage of the extra<br/>\n&gt;proc, you&#39;ll have to put an inferior weapon in your secondary.  The<br/>\n&gt;Ebon Razor is close enough in damage output (it has a better ratio)<br/>\n&gt;to the SSoY that I think you&#39;ll have better total damage with this<br/>\n&gt;combination than with the SSoY and any other weapon you currectly<br/>\n&gt;have in your second hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But, as has been suggested, getting a better offhand weapon might be<br/>\n&gt;the best solution long term.  Only problem, on Xegony, Sionatchies<br/>\n&gt;Partisans are hard to come by.  I&#39;ve been looking for weeks and weeks<br/>\n&gt;to no avail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(btw my dex IS above 100, 110 or 108 dont, but defently above 100)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes a better off hand weapon is proberly one sollution. I have been thinking of<br/>\ngetting a second yak. My guild can help me there, but the thing is<br/>\nIm not all that impressed with the yak the effects are resisted alot by many<br/>\nmobs and I would for sure prefer a thing like the sioanitchie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Run some /log on tests with a Parser to see which combination is<br/>\n&gt;giving you better results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt;Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Duh, I will do that :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice you all. Knew I could count on you. This list is the<br/>\nbestest *smile*!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think I will keep the Ebon razor in primary hand and put the yak in my<br/>\nsecondary.<br/>\nThen I will look for a good piercer or maybe a second yak to replace the Razor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker(x) Silverdrum &lt;Creators Path&gt;, bard o 38th song, bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
