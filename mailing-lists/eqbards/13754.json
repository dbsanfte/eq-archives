For some reason you seem to think that the<br/>\nfact that you put more hours per day into this game should<br/>\ngive you some sort of higher priority.  It doesn&#39;t.  All those<br/>\nhours you put into the game beyond what the average player<br/>\nputs in is subsidized by all the people who play fewer hours<br/>\nthan the average player.  Without them, this game would be<br/>\ncosting you on the order of $100/mo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; should rethink that. Ok how many 49&#39;s? About 200 again. How many 48&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; 300. How many 47&#39;s ? About 300 and so and so on. How many 46+ zones ? The<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So we have 1300 L46-50 players.  OTOH, we have (by a<br/>\nconservative estimate) 7700 L1-45 players.  86% of the money<br/>\nfor this game is coming from non-L46-50 players.  Given an<br/>\neither/or choice, do they ignore 7700 players and risk losing<br/>\n86% of their income, or ignore 1300 players and risk losing<br/>\n14% of their income?  That&#39;s a no-brainer to me, despite my<br/>\nmain character being L45.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; planes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>\n&gt; spawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>\n&gt; and clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>\n&gt; planes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>\n&gt; plane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>\n&gt; spawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to. So you<br/>\n&gt; got all these 46+ people who play a good 10 hours at the least usually 5<br/>\n&gt; hours a day. So why do you think were ocmplaining now?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone is arguing that the high level zones<br/>\naren&#39;t overcrowded.  What they&#39;re arguing is that L46+ stuff<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be Verant&#39;s top priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
