It still locks up in all AGP<br/>\nmodes at all aperture settings that I&#39;ve tried.<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom my research on the net (guess I should have done this first), I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound out that alot of Via chipset mobos have problems with GeForce cards.<br/>\nSome work (like yours), but many, many, many more don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve also found<br/>\nout that there are no reported problems with the Voodoo5 5500s on those same<br/>\nmobos.  When I have the choice of waiting for updated drivers and bioses<br/>\nwhile experiencing lockups, or running a slightly lesser video card that<br/>\nwon&#39;t lockup, I&#39;ll take the slightly lesser card (which games support or<br/>\nwill support T&L anyway?).<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I still stand by my statement that the nVidia cards have problems with<br/>\nVia chipsets.  If you get lucky (or pick the right vendor who has a bios<br/>\nthat will work), go with the GTS.  It&#39;s an absolutely amazing card with<br/>\ngreat features and capable of hardware T&L.  If you don&#39;t get lucky, go with<br/>\nthe Voodoo5 which has hardware FSAA (GTS is only software) and might<br/>\nbenchmark a little less in some areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 26, 2000 10:15 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Video (WAY OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had a single problem with the system I built using an Asus K7V<br/>\nMotherboard, Athlon 800 and a Leadtek GTS.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaryl - I would look into upgrading your BIOS and your AGP drivers before<br/>\ngiving up on the GTS...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daryl Schwemley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drs@...\">drs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 26, 2000 10:03 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Video (WAY OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue to factor in is that the GeForce2 GTS has problems with Via<br/>\nchipsey motherboards (in my experience).  This mean that most people using<br/>\nAthlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>\nGTS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in the process of return my GTS and will be purchasing a Voodoo5 5500<br/>\ntonight.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes assuming this doesn&#39;t get Kabong&#39;ed<br/>\nbefore then.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than compatibility, I will agree that the GTS is the better bang for<br/>\nthe buck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

I personally prefer<br/>\nthe GeForce 2 because it&#39;s performance window is far higher and it offers a<br/>\nlot of features that games are now starting to support.  As of right now<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t many but the game industry is starting to support more and more<br/>\nfeatures that NVidia is offering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the system is JUST for EQ I would get the Voodoo card since EQ was<br/>\nspecifically designed for Voodoo technology back when it was built (circa<br/>\n1997).  If you want to have the performance of the GeForce 2 on future<br/>\ngames, however, I&#39;d recommend the GeForce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO:  GeForce is better bang for the buck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4321/13/_/451022/_/964624609/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4321/13/_/451022/_/964624609/</a>&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4321/13/_/451022/_/964624609/pr_jacket_468_12k\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/4321/13/_/451022/_/964624609/pr_jacket_468_12k</a><br/>\n.gif&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
