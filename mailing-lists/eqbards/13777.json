I know not all bards spend as much time running around asking people<br/>\nabout quests as I do, but still given the amount of time I am fairly certain<br/>\nthat if these really were in the game they would have been found by now.  GZ<br/>\ninsisted they really were in the game, but that we would have to look hard<br/>\nfor them.  I have checked nearly every merchant outside of the evil cities<br/>\nand the gnomes in solusek, but have had no luck.  Why they would be in any<br/>\nof those places anyhow is beyond me.  Does anyone have any other ideas, or<br/>\nis this something we need to somehow emphasize further that despite Verant<br/>\nthinking &#39;It&#39;s in the game&#39; it isn&#39;t?  Certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time<br/>\nthey were &#39;positive&#39; that something was in the game when it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nespecially concerning bards.  I&#39;m sure everyone over 46 remembers the<br/>\nscorned banshees they swore up and down were dropping Imbrued when they were<br/>\nnot.  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
