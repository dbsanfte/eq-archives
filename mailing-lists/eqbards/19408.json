In fact, I think his weapon <br/>\nskills have improved more since I started helping than before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe start off each battle grouped.  With mandolin in hand, I twist <br/>\nAnthem D&#39;Arms, Jig O&#39; Vigor, and Hymn of Restoration.  I do not do<br/>\nany <br/>\ndamage to the mob myself.  Once the mob is around 1/4 health, I <br/>\ndisband and throw in a couple of bellows just to speed up its demise. <br/>\n Once the battle has been won, I target the warrior, invite him to <br/>\ngroup, fire up Selo&#39;s or the hymn, depending on his health, and off<br/>\nwe <br/>\ngo to the next mob.  The warrior get&#39;s all the experience and is <br/>\nusually at full health at the end of each battle.  Lately we&#39;ve been <br/>\nplaying ring around the skellies near the mino caves in Steamfont, <br/>\nwith a minotaur slaver pull in between each round of skellies.  And I <br/>\noriginally thought I&#39;d have to wait for charm to become an effective <br/>\npower leveller...<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Bard of 16 songs (and holding),<br/>\nPersonal trainer to Talonfyre,<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
