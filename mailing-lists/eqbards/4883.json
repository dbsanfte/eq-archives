The spoiler below may be vital to<br/>\nany bard&#39;s ability to freely travel in Freeport.  If you<br/>\nregularly group with paladins, I suggest you go ahead and read<br/>\nit, as the spoiler is minor, but the grief it can save you is<br/>\nimmense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 4 Aug 1999, Scott Thompson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***SPOILER***<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; Ok, so curiosity got the better of you I see 8)<br/>\n&gt; Here is the story- there is a guard that spawns<br/>\n&gt; in the bank named Krazen Loosh. The people are<br/>\n&gt; all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>\n&gt; they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>\n&gt; do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>\n&gt; associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>\n&gt; people camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeware, this will make you KOS to the Freeport Militia.  They<br/>\nare the guards in West and East Freeport.  The guards in North<br/>\nFreeport are all paladins (except Krazen) which is why you do<br/>\nnot become KOS to them.  This is actually part of a bigger<br/>\nplot, in which the paladins and the militia are both fighting<br/>\nfor control of Freeport.  Nearly anything that raises your<br/>\nfaction with the paladins lowers it with the militia, and vice<br/>\nversa.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a member of your party is fighting Krazen, and any of your<br/>\nparty effect songs pulses during the fight, YOU will also get<br/>\nthe faction hit for killing Krazen.  So be careful if you&#39;re<br/>\nat the bank and grouped with new people or any friends you<br/>\nknow who wish to kill Krazen (it&#39;s actually a paldin quest).<br/>\nOnce someone becomes KOS to the militia, they are KOS to<br/>\nKrazen, so they may have to fight even if they don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
