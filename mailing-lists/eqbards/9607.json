You have your personal inventory, bank inventory,<br/>\nworn items, and that&#39;s it.  Assuming you have all your<br/>\ninventory full of 10 slot backpacks and chock full of items,<br/>\nthat&#39;s 160 items per character.  Call it 180 to account for<br/>\nworn items.  Assume all 8 character slots are used in this<br/>\nmanner.  That&#39;s 1440 items per player.  Assume 5000 players<br/>\nper server all doing this, and that&#39;s 7.2 million items as a<br/>\nclose-to-worst-case scenario.  If each item has 1k of data<br/>\nassociated with it, that&#39;s roughly 7 GB.  My PC&#39;s hard drive<br/>\nis bigger than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     The one Loot once would have a similar type of major<br/>\n&gt; database change - codewise even much trickier.  Lore is<br/>\n&gt; pretty easy - just check what you have.  Loot Once would<br/>\n&gt; require a historical database of every item a player ever<br/>\n&gt; looted.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are only a thousand or fewer &quot;named&quot; mobs with special<br/>\ndrops in the game.  If you assume 5000 players per server, and<br/>\na 1000 mob bitfield, it&#39;s only 5 megabits, or about 625k of<br/>\nextra data for the entire server.  I made a similar suggestion<br/>\nto the UO dev team (for different reasons) and the problem<br/>\nthere was that this stuff is handled via a high level<br/>\nscripting language; so you can&#39;t have a bitfield - a boolean<br/>\ntakes 1 byte minimum, probably more.  I agree it would be a<br/>\nmonumental task to graft it into the current system.  I was<br/>\nthinking more in terms of future games (in case anyone on the<br/>\nlist finds himself as a programmer in such a game :).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem with the loot-once idea is that once you&#39;ve<br/>\nlooted pretty much everything, there&#39;s nothing left to do<br/>\nexcept help other people get their stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
