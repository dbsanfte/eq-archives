I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;silly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt;did.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;too powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;never felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Mon, 2 Aug 1999, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work!  Granted, I was in an ingredible laggy zone, was experiencing a<br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; amount of packet loss, and the wizard was running around, slippery<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bugger (half the time I&#39;d see him standing one place when in reality my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; client was wrong and he was somewhere else).  But still, embarassing to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bested by one a few levels bellow me.  I&#39;d never use Lullaby for this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; purpose again, I didn&#39;t see him interupted once when I reviewed the<br/>\n&gt; text.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe Lullaby would be more useful for this purpose with a shorter<br/>\n&gt; period<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; between pulses.
