A followup question now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince it is a known bug that equipping a drum does not increase the damage<br/>\nfrom the DOT or increase the amount of magic resistance the mob loses, was<br/>\nwondering if there is any positive effect for equiping the drum.  I was<br/>\nthinking that its possible that the mobs chance to initially resist the song<br/>\nmay be decreased if you equip the drum.  For example, against a mob that<br/>\ncons blue to you, you have a 60% chance of getting the song to stick just<br/>\nsinging it with no drum equipped.  If you have a drum equipped, the chances<br/>\nof getting it to stick increases to 70%.  Anyone tested this?  Subjectively,<br/>\nI have noticed when I sing DDD with a horn equipped it seems mobs resist<br/>\nless than when I just sing DDD.  If that is true, you would think equipping<br/>\na drum increases your chances of getting Furfils to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
