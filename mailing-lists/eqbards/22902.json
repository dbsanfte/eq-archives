Interesting.  We can<br/>\nempathize with the nerfs and hope to never see the hacks(excepts for Guides<br/>\nand GM&#39;s on a rampage).<br/>\n<br/>\nSnip:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers of the online fantasy game Diablo II must wait almost a week for<br/>\ntheir characters to be restored after a hack attack, developer Blizzard<br/>\nEntertainment revealed this morning, Andrew Smith writes. <br/>\nHackers reportedly exploited a weakness in Blizzard&#39;s servers to gain access<br/>\nto player accounts. By repeatedly attempting to login as another player,<br/>\nthey caused the authorisation process to fail, which then granted access. <br/>\nThey then took control of the player&#39;s character and stripped it of<br/>\nequipment and bonus items. In some cases the characters were killed. <br/>\nThe hack seems to have been targeted at characters of a high skill level<br/>\nwith valuable items and experience points. Such characters will have been<br/>\nbuilt up over many months of playing, often for hours each day. <br/>\nBlizzard announced this morning: &quot;Monday, January 8, we will be reviving all<br/>\nhardcore characters who died between December 19th and January 1st. The<br/>\nrestored hardcore characters will be revived with the experience, skills and<br/>\nitems possessed as of Tuesday, December 19th.&quot; <br/>\nThis is an embarrassing incident for Blizzard, and follows months of<br/>\npetitions and protests about bugs and unbalanced gameplay in what is one of<br/>\nthe best-selling titles of recent years. <br/>\nIn August, changes to the skill system in Diablo II left some players with<br/>\nseverely weakened characters. Many complained that hundreds of hours<br/>\ninvested in the game had gone to waste. <br/>\nBlizzard was also criticised for not notifying players of key changes made<br/>\nto the game rules until after they had been exposed by fan sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd Snip<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
