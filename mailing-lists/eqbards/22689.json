It&#39;s the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:14 PM 12/4/00 -0500, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Thought you might find this amusing...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hadn&#39;t played my bard since the 10 slot hotkey banks went live, but<br/>\n&gt;decided to finally sit down & remap the keys & give my rogue a rest.  So I<br/>\n&gt;get the hotkeys all mapped from using Numpad 7, 8, 4, 5, 1, & 2 to using<br/>\n&gt;Numpad &quot;/&quot; through &quot;.&quot;  Then I create a bank with all my songs, a &quot;/g INC -<br/>\n&gt;%target&quot; message, and an Off Hand slot to swap instruments.  Look up,<br/>\n&gt;forward, and down got moved from Numpad 96&3 to Numpad 74&1.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That accomplished, I try to attack something.  I spot a Lion Matriarch,<br/>\n&gt;blue to me at level 13, and try to hit it with one pulse of Bellow.  The<br/>\n&gt;lioness wanders off unharmed while I figure out why I&#39;m suddenly staring at<br/>\n&gt;my feet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I realize my error and reposition my hand a bit more to the left.  Then I<br/>\n&gt;make my way towards a carrion spider and try to hit it with one pulse of<br/>\n&gt;Bellow.  The spider wanders off unharmed while I try to figure out why I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;talking to myself.  I remind myself that Bellow has moved from slot 5 to<br/>\n&gt;slot 9.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I run off to a safe corner and rehearse my battle setlist (Bellow, CoD,<br/>\n&gt;Hymn) a couple times to make sure I know where my hands should be.  Then I<br/>\n&gt;go looking for another mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I spot another spider and hit it with Bellow.  Yay!  I finally hit<br/>\n&gt;something!  I restart Selo&#39;s and head to the zone edge.  I turn around and<br/>\n&gt;attempt to switch hotkey banks to grab my mandolin out of inventory.  That<br/>\n&gt;would be a shift 1, but my hand has gone back over to the old keys, so I<br/>\n&gt;find myself staring at the sky.  I look forward again and try to hit Shift<br/>\n&gt;1 again.  I inadvertently turn off numlock.  The spider is on me now and<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m attempting to sing while struggling with the hotkeys.  I soon discover<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve turned off Numlock, toggle it back, restart Selo&#39;s, and hit the zone.<br/>\n&gt;No sense messing around - I knew I&#39;d botched that battle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After about a half hour of similar mishaps, I finally start killing things.<br/>\n&gt;Yay!  Then a druid guildmate who&#39;s primary is a bard - and a good one -<br/>\n&gt;asks to group.  I warn her of the difficulties I&#39;ve been having but she<br/>\n&gt;assures me I&#39;ll do fine and tells me to start pulling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I find a spider and try to hit it with bellow, but instead tell the druid,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Inc - a carrion spider...Inc - a carrion spider&quot;  Said it twice because i<br/>\n&gt;thought I was starting and stopping a song, see?  It wouldn&#39;t have been so<br/>\n&gt;bad except in the time it took me to realize what I&#39;d done wrong the spider<br/>\n&gt;hand wandered dangerously close to a gorge hound.  So I quickly scour the<br/>\n&gt;area, find another spider and bring it back to the druid, who&#39;s scratching<br/>\n&gt;her head wondering why it took so long to pull a spider.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I make that same mistake a few more times, and eventually she has to ask<br/>\n&gt;whether I know multiple incoming messages are supposed to be an indication<br/>\n&gt;of multiple mobs being pulled.  &lt;sigh&gt;  So much for making a good<br/>\n&gt;impression.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Furthering my reputation as Newbie For Life, I turned numlock off 4 more<br/>\n&gt;times over the next half hour.  If I managed to keep two songs up during<br/>\n&gt;battle I was doing good.  But my druid friend stuck with me, and eventually<br/>\n&gt;I started getting the hang of it again.  Yay! Three songs, almost four<br/>\n&gt;stacked up at a time.  Pulls as fast and smooth as an expensive German car.<br/>\n&gt;No more than a few seconds downtime between battles, and rarely that much.<br/>\n&gt;Oh yeah, this is what being a bard is all about!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s when I notice I&#39;d been singing Elemental Rhythms against spiders all<br/>\n&gt;night.  Heh, I used to have ER in slot one, PR in slot 3.  I cleverly<br/>\n&gt;switched them when rearranging keys.  Oh how I blushed...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evulia, singing 13 songs, all in the wrong key, Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
