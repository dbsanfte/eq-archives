The main<br/>\nplayers in the guild are a group of friends from MN, and while they<br/>\nare very friendly, they seem to keep to themselves a lot.  I have, on<br/>\noccasion, gotten great deals on items and even some for free...but so<br/>\nfar that&#39;s about all the guild&#39;s been good for.  Until I find a guild<br/>\non our server that is truly what I&#39;m looking for (or break down and<br/>\ntry to make it myself), I&#39;m content to have it the way it is.  I do<br/>\nask on guild if anyone wants to join a group when I&#39;m looking for<br/>\nreplacements, but I rarely get any answers.  Oh, and Faras, the third<br/>\nperson in my regular group is a member of the guild, but has the same<br/>\nbeefs with it I do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone on E&#39;ci know anyone who wants to help start a guild? =)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn...happily procrastinating on her final project.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
