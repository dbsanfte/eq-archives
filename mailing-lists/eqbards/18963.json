I was asked <br/>\ntwice to trade for a Selo&#39;s drum when I had just gotten into the L40&#39;s. Both <br/>\ntimes they wanted SMR&#39;s, FBSS&#39;s, that sort of thing. I laughed and refered <br/>\nthem to someone who might actually consider trading those items. I had <br/>\nneither, I try to avoid Lower Guk as much as possible. I have been offered <br/>\nsinging boots twice, first time the guy said he would take a sharkbone <br/>\nwarhammer plus some plat, second guy wanted &#39;enchanter items&#39;. I didn&#39;t make <br/>\neither trade, my personal opinion was the drop rate of these items wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwell enough established to determine actual value. I am in wait and see on <br/>\nprices (considering I have less than 2k in the bank), may even brave the New <br/>\nBlackburrow to get them myself. I don&#39;t know how common the drop is or how <br/>\ntought the mobs that drop it are, so that makes it hard to determine the <br/>\nvalue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to spend time hunting someone that needed any usable equipment I <br/>\nfound but these days I just don&#39;t have time it seems. Our guild did try to <br/>\nprovide equipment once, by way of collecting donations from members and <br/>\nmaking them available on request but it turned into a bone of contention. We <br/>\nalso got swampped with new members who just wanted stuff. Now it&#39;s a private <br/>\nthing, although we do try to help each other out when possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, there is a very strange area in Skyfire. Our monk was out pulling and <br/>\nwent high on the wall on the lefthand side. he went over the top of what he <br/>\nthought was the wall and fell to his death. I lev&#39;ed and went hunting and <br/>\nfound a sizable valley, that seemed empty and had no apparent exit. I <br/>\nrecovered his body and was able to lev/selos up one of the walls that had <br/>\njust enough slant to let me get out. This is located on the &#39;wall&#39; near the <br/>\nglobe and dragon statue. Also further up along that same wall is a box that <br/>\nrotates and makes a moving sound when you click on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
