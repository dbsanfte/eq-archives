I frequently &#39;waste&#39; levelling time in that fruitless thing <br/>\n     we bards know as travelling.  Perhaps the largest impetus in my <br/>\n     selection of this class was that accelerado song.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     The other night I got the urge to visit Guk.  Being a wood elf bard, I <br/>\n     knew that upon my arrival there, the inhabitents would view me <br/>\n     indifferently as long as I did not attack anything, and I would be <br/>\n     able to explore the dungeon in relative safety.  Sure enough, upon <br/>\n     entrance, everything left me alone.  I strode confidently about the <br/>\n     halls, gawking at the sights and actually watching a train or two pass <br/>\n     me by with nary a hair falling out of my helm...<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Well, long story short, in my joy of exploration, I got quite <br/>\n     thorougly lost.  For those who have never visited Guk, it is very <br/>\n     mazelike, with thin passages that begin to run together after a time.  <br/>\n     During this aimless wandering, I would come upon the bodies of fallen <br/>\n     frogloks, sometimes quite high level, lieing prone on the floor.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Being level 14, there was no chance I would have ever been able to <br/>\n     defeat these beasts myself.  But these bodies were left by trains that <br/>\n     destroyed or ran off the high levellers who were attempting to kill <br/>\n     them for the exp and the loot.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     And with those people dead/long gone, I could loot the bodies of the <br/>\n     fallen froglocks myself.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     If you enjoy exploration, are of good alignment, and don&#39;t mind <br/>\n     getting lost, I recommend this diversion.  I made over 20 plat the <br/>\n     night I wandered lost and aimless through the halls of guk, just from <br/>\n     looting the corpses of the fallen out of the massive trains that <br/>\n     accumulate in that dungeon.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Just don&#39;t attack anything while your down there, or all of a sudden, <br/>\n     you are lost AND in a threatening dungeon.  Thats not exactly good. <br/>\n     ;-)<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Derrick<br/>\n     aka Drae, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
