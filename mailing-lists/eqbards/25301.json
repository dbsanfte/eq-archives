On Rodcet Nife, most dragon raids are closed unless the guild holding the raid is too high to field a decent team.  Then the first scale/book whatever is reserved.  Still, these raids are a great opportunity to meet solid players that you need not fear grouping with.  (at 52 I avoid pickup groups as much as possible -- a bad one will get you killed and Rezzes aren&#39;t always available)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as you hit dragon raid age -- if you do dragon raids -- your needs will change.  Weapons are secondary to a good drum and lute and resists start to mean a whole lot more.  Poison, especially, if you are hitting Temple of Veeshan is a good idea.  Velious and kunark dragons have this bad habit of inflicting horrendous dots on your party.  Disenchanting melody can help quite a bit when that happens.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to any bard that plans on doing dragon raids, go to EW and do the ulthork tusk quest to start getting gems for resist jewelry.  even if you don&#39;t get a blue diamond out of it, you are building a cash reserve to start getting resist gear.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Rebecca Small &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>&gt; wrote<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is still to try and get into Ragefire camps for red scales and<br/>\nwatch for Gore as much as possible. If you can get into a Vox/Naggy raid,<br/>\ndo it. It will probably take you several levels before you have all the<br/>\npieces. Helping people with Gore/Vox/Nag/Trak/Rage gets your name known<br/>\nand brownie points built. You will need them if you spot Vox up and when<br/>\nyou get ready to spawn Trak for your last step. My guild has some Vox<br/>\nlevel toons and we need a frost book for one of our main paladins.
