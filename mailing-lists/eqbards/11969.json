Well, same thing happened to a<br/>\nfriend of mine.  We were in Paw getting some snakeskin gloves for me, I was<br/>\nonly 15th at the time and he was 22nd.  Well, we got the gloves and were<br/>\nheaded out when my buddy got caught in one of the gates.  The only gnolls<br/>\naround were too green to bother me so I waited around for him while he<br/>\n/petitioned.  After about 30 minutes a GM appeared to talk to us.  The GM<br/>\ntold my friend, who has since quit unfortunately over this and other<br/>\ncustomer service issues, that he could not help him because at 22nd level he<br/>\nshould have a spell that would get him out of the situation, Mel&#39;s Motion.<br/>\nMy friend told the GM he didn&#39;t have the spell as he had never bought it,<br/>\nbut the GM said since there was no way he could verify that he couldn&#39;t help<br/>\nhim.  We both thought it was ridiculous at the time and I still do.  We<br/>\nended up getting him out but it was an involved affair.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 2:57 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] New Paw, old tricks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, last night we took a little trip in to the Lair of Infected Paw (hey,<br/>\nyou old beta guys, how come so many zones have 2 names? SplitPaw/Infected<br/>\nPaw; Lower Guk/Ruin of Old Guk; Beholder/Gorge of King Xorrb; others?<br/>\nDidn&#39;t the terrain art guys talk to the monster AI guys?) Anyhow it was<br/>\npretty much fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I like dungeons that I know the geography pretty well and I have been<br/>\ngetting killed in Paw since a very young age and done many a CR - even<br/>\nbefore self-invis.  Trains - man that place can train.  We zoned in to be<br/>\ngreeted by a mega train.  We were 2 groups of 5 & 6. And another group had<br/>\njust fled for the zone.  There were at least 20 gnolls - it was the kinda<br/>\nscene where you go &quot;zone zone - its not worth it&quot; but stay cuz you are<br/>\nfascinated by the sheer number of gnolls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our tanks and casters started fighting them and our enchanters started AE<br/>\nmezzing - at least I sure hope they were AE mezzing.  But everyone was<br/>\nfighting a different gnoll and switching gnolls to taunt off the casters.<br/>\nIn short it was a total mess! So, I figured wtf??? Lets see how these dogs<br/>\nlike screetch with a horn.  I equipped my brass horn and let fly with some<br/>\ntruly blood curdling notes - at least the doggies thot so and off they went.<br/>\nStart a train?  Hell, this was a mega train already.  But it seemed like a<br/>\ngood idea and did clear the area out for a while.  They did of course come<br/>\nback and it took us a long time to kill them all  - wave after wave after<br/>\nwave of gnolls.  But none of us got killed and only 2 had to zone.  Had we<br/>\nnot been at the dead end by the zone - I certainly would not have used the<br/>\nfear song but at that point it was about my only option with the songs I had<br/>\nmemmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, we were trying to clear the first bridge and got another train<br/>\npulled onto us.  This was definitely not the place to be fearing things off<br/>\nso I stepped out and memmed in Lullaby.  Our enchanter was either not Ae<br/>\nmezzing, our tanks and thos in the melee were not /assisting or there was<br/>\ntoo much gnoll switching going on - whatever - it was kinda last ditch<br/>\neffort but I chose Lullaby with the lute and I think I tried pulsing it<br/>\neven.  Even with its reduced abilities there were enough nodding gnolls that<br/>\nI think it helped.  Hopefully it was interrupting the gnoll casters who were<br/>\nhealing the gnoll tanks.  On this one we did lose 3 of our lower level<br/>\nmembers (all casters) but we dragged them a bit deeper into the dungeon and<br/>\nour cleric rezzed them back (its pretty sweet to have a lev 50 cleric in<br/>\nyour guild and in your expedition ;).  At least for us baby upper 30&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then we decided to take the age-old short cut and we hopped off that<br/>\nfirst bridge for the lower level.  Be carefull and hop onto the ground<br/>\nbecause there are blue (to me at 38) snakes in the water that will aggro on<br/>\nyou.  We cleared some more gnolls and worked our way to the old shaman&#39;s<br/>\nrooms (the 2 rooms at the top of the small staircase.)  Each party took a<br/>\nroom and mine drew the one with the necro - with a bit of help from the<br/>\nothers who finished early - we killed these guys too.  Only PH&#39;s - no named<br/>\nbosses were up. We sat thru one more spawn and then decided to fight our way<br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFighting into a passageway, I tarried too long in a door way and got trapped<br/>\non top of the door when it came down.  Door comes down, Sylly gets on top of<br/>\ndoor, door goes up and Sylly goes up and is stuck inside the terrain.   With<br/>\nvisions of falling thru the world for 10000 dmg like happened to me in Upper<br/>\nGuk - I did not wriggle around too much but sent in a petition.  I thought<br/>\nof Melifious motion but did not want to zap the others nor disband at that<br/>\npoint.  So, they got out and our druid came back or stayed back and we gated<br/>\nto NK.  And within 20 mins of getting stuck - more like 15 my petition got<br/>\nanswered - they do seem to be getting better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo all in all - New Paw was quite fun.  It was lots different even though<br/>\nmost of the old AI is still there.  Healers placed out of immediate area<br/>\nhealing the tanks you fight, etc. It was fun to have more &quot;grown up&quot; magic<br/>\nand somewhat better party manners (good weps, assist the tanks, mez, etc.)<br/>\nto fight them.  And trains - - hehe - its still got trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
