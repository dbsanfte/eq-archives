The castle is tough - especially.  The agro ranges and pathing<br/>\nof the mobs is very different from anywhere else you have been.  You can<br/>\nagro something and it will &quot;run off&quot; (different pathing - goes away rather<br/>\nthan directly to you) aggravate many more and then come back with a small<br/>\narmy and do battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes less is better.  A level 50 druid can prolly pull the gypsy(s) you<br/>\nneed and kill them fairly easily.  Then you could come in invis and loot<br/>\nwhat you need.  That is the easy way.  If you dont have a lev 50 druid at<br/>\nyour disposal, then a full party of 35 to 40 or two partys of low to upper<br/>\n30&#39;s could clear in thru the tower (secret wall by the crypt.  secret doors<br/>\nto the stairs going up.  one way to tower - other way (left) goes in to<br/>\nbedroom and castle 2nd floor.)  Clearing thru the pit and up the ramp is<br/>\nrisky.  One runner gets loose and you can pull the castle.  Clearing in thru<br/>\nthe front door is also risky for same reason.  But this time it does not<br/>\nneed to be a runner.  Your pull mob may have a path that goes away first and<br/>\nit will agro lots before they all return to deal with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, I guess you could hang out and wait for inevitable trains and try to<br/>\npick off the back end of trains.  Maybe a ranger can watch for gypsys,<br/>\nsnare, then he zones.  As the train receeds, the snared gypsys are prime for<br/>\nyou party to pounce on. (Kind of like old Harm&#39;s cheese pull for DW Gobs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, check the archives here - there are some good MM tactics and advice<br/>\ngiven fairly recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep us posted and tell us how you fared,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 08, 2000 9:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] MM anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Writing again to garner any information you all may have on the ball room<br/>\n&gt; (or gypsy room) in MM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most specifically I&#39;d like to find out what level range you suggest is<br/>\n&gt; necessary to break and take the room, as well as any tips on breaking and<br/>\n&gt; holding the room long enough to pick up a MM drum, and some lutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; Proud owner of a Genuine Troll Hide belt. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
