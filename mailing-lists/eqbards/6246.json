Not only do they have a couple hundred more hp, but<br/>\ntheir parries, blocks, and ripostes really cut down on the<br/>\ndamage they take.  When fighting in Cazic, the lizards that<br/>\ntake 20-30 seconds to drop my melee friends by one bubble<br/>\nusually do the same to me in just two or three hits.  You do<br/>\n*not* want to be playing an area effect damage song that will<br/>\nmake you the primary recipient of damage from all the mobs the<br/>\ngroup currently isn&#39;t fighting.  If at all possible, let the<br/>\nreal tanks do the tanking.  The only time I try to take damage<br/>\nanymore is if it&#39;s a tough fight (to ease the damage the<br/>\nothers are taking), I&#39;m the closest thing in the group to a<br/>\ntank, or if I&#39;m trying to get a mob off a caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; P.S. to jhenders i finally got a ykesha last week to replace one of my wakis<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The waki is not primary-hand-only?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
