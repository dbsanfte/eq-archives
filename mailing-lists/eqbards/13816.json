I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1491368326\">Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start over?  I typed<br/>\nin /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t seen in a long<br/>\ntime.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed in addition to<br/>\nplayers.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, or /groupsay but<br/>\ninstead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the phrase I typed<br/>\nto my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire list, there are<br/>\na few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made numerous attempts<br/>\nat removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces before I type<br/>\nin any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my friend list.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ directory this will<br/>\ndelete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>\nfriends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
