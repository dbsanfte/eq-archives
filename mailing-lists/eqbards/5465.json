Not to<br/>\nbe outdone, especially on the multiple-deaths-per-night thread, I submit<br/>\nthis for nomination for Norath&#39;s Worst Grouping Experience.  Sorry about<br/>\nthe length, which will probably get me kicked off the list, but, well, I<br/>\nkept dying!  This happened about a month ago with my bard on Tunare, <br/>\nEvulia, and her halfling druid friend Zenia, both level 7.  It was also<br/>\nmy first time in Blackburrow and my first time grouping with strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nZenia and I enter Blackburrow to the echoes of gnoll cries and screams<br/>\nof anguish.  Bodies are strewn all around.  The air reeks of blood and<br/>\ncarnage.  We decend a short way into the depths of the burrow, tripping<br/>\nover dismembered limbs we dare not try to identify.  We stop in a<br/>\nhallway and spy a scrawny gnoll.<br/>\nZenia: This looks good.  Shall we take that scrawny?<br/>\nme:  Aye.<br/>\nWe attack.  Another scrawny gnoll joins in.  I find myself getting<br/>\npushed around and can&#39;t stay focused on one gnoll at a time.  Singing is<br/>\nnear impossible.  Zenia watches her manna supply warily. Although we are<br/>\nvictorious, the battle lasts far longer than either of us had anticipated.<br/>\nBut before we are fully rested another battle ensues.  As I&#39;m being smacked<br/>\naround by a gnoll and a patrolling gnoll, I watch in horror as a guard<br/>\nbashes Zenia&#39;s head in.  Fighting now to avenge my friend, I jam a dagger<br/>\nthrough the throat of one gnoll, only to die at the hands of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at Qeynos we are joined by a ranger of the same age.  The ranger<br/>\nclaims he knows of a great spot where you&#39;ll see, at most, 2 guards and<br/>\n2 regular gnolls.  No trains.  It sounds like paradise & we head off,<br/>\nstopping briefly to loot our corpses.  Arriving at the ranger&#39;s hunting<br/>\ngrounds we are joined by a wizard.<br/>\nWizard: Hail<br/>\nOthers: Hail<br/>\nWizard:  OK, see that guard?  I&#39;m going to root him.  Zenia, you snare<br/>\nhim.  Then we&#39;ll all slaughter him.<br/>\nZenia:  Wait, medding.<br/>\nThe ranger and Zenia begin buffing the party.<br/>\nWizard:  OK, I&#39;m getting over to the other side of him now...<br/>\nRanger:  Wait, medding.<br/>\nWizard:  OK the coast is clear.  I think we can take this guy.<br/>\nRanger:  I&#39;m not at full manna yet.<br/>\nZenia:  Nor I<br/>\nThe wizard examines the gnoll guard from every angle, then hops around on<br/>\nhis toes, punching the air like a professional boxer warming up for a<br/>\nfight.  I practice sense heading and forage for food.  Zenia and the<br/>\nranger finish medding.<br/>\nWizard:  Is everyone ready?<br/>\nZenia:  (standing back up) Aye, ready!<br/>\nRanger: All set<br/>\nme: (stuffing an odd root I&#39;ve just dug up into my pack) Good to go!<br/>\nWizard: OK, Zenia will snare it first, then we all attack.<br/>\nZenia casts.  The guard attacks Zenia.  The ranger rushes to her<br/>\nassistance.  I follow.  Another guard spawns and attacks the ranger.  A<br/>\nregular gnoll spawns.  The ranger screams and falls.  Zenia screams and<br/>\nfalls.  I scream and fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nI awaken outside Qeynos & see Zenia a few feet away.  I sit down next to<br/>\nher and begin memorizing songs.<br/>\nme: Hail<br/>\nZenia: Hail<br/>\nThe ranger awakens beside us.  He sits down and opens his spellbook.<br/>\nRanger: Hail<br/>\nZenia & I: Hail<br/>\nRanger: Did we all die?<br/>\nme: (noting the wizard isn&#39;t in our zone) No, the wizard&#39;s alive.<br/>\nWe wait for eachother to finish memorizing our spells and head back to<br/>\nretrieve our corpses.  Zenia and the ranger begin the whole<br/>\nbuffing/medding process again.  Another guard spawns.<br/>\nWizard: OK, see that guard?  I&#39;ll root him, Zenia will snare him, then<br/>\nwe all attack.<br/>\nRanger:  Am I the only tank?<br/>\nme:  I&#39;ll tank as best I can.<br/>\nRanger: Yeah, you were hitting pretty good for a bit there...<br/>\nWizard:  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Anyway, THIS time we all stay on the<br/>\nfirst guard if others spawn, OK?  If we can all concentrate on one at a<br/>\ntime we&#39;ll manage.<br/>\nZenia:  We need more people.  I&#39;m going to see who I can get.<br/>\nZenia tries to enlist others while meditating and buffing.  I continue<br/>\npracticing sense heading and forage for food.  The wizard wanders<br/>\nrestlessly over to the guard to make faces at it.  The ranger stands<br/>\nup...<br/>\nRanger: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WOULD SOMEONE, ANYONE AT ALL, PLEASE COME<br/>\nHELP ME???  I&#39;M BEGGING YOU!! PLEASE???<br/>\nZenia jumps to her feet!  I whirl around to face the ranger, gripping my<br/>\ndagger tightly!  The wizard rushes back over to us, eyes flashing and<br/>\nsmiling like a madman!<br/>\nRanger: SORRY!! WRONG HOT KEY!! NO NEED OF ASSISTANCE!! SORRY!!<br/>\nThe wizard walks away pouting.  Zenia shakes her head and goes back to<br/>\nmedding.<br/>\nme:  That&#39;s one hell of a hotkey!  What were you trying to do?<br/>\nRanger: (shrugging sheepishly) Forage?<br/>\nWizard:  HELP! HELP! WIZARD IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!<br/>\nAfter a moment&#39;s hesitation (understandable, I guess), we rush over to<br/>\ndiscover a battle has begun between the guard and our wizard.  More<br/>\ngnolls spawn.  Screams ring through the air.  The party cannot tell if<br/>\nthe blood that covers them is their own or their foes.  Beaten and<br/>\ndizzy, I try to back away but am slaughtered.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at Qeynos I begin memorizing the tools of my trade.  With my nose<br/>\nin the book, I didn&#39;t notice Zenia come up behind me.<br/>\nZenia: Hail.  Good news.  I got us a cleric.  He&#39;s on his way to the<br/>\nothers.<br/>\nWe head back.<br/>\nCleric:  Hail.<br/>\nZenia & I:  Hail.<br/>\nRanger:  (to wizard) You said if it ran to chase it!<br/>\nWizard:  No, I said if it ran I&#39;d root it and then you could go get it.<br/>\nRanger:  You told me to run!<br/>\nWizard:  Well it doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s dead now.  Just next time<br/>\nwait for me to root it.<br/>\nThe wizard turns and walks away.  I watch with keen facination as tiny<br/>\ndaggers emerge from the ranger&#39;s eyes and head straight for the wizards<br/>\nback.  Assuming this to be a ranger-only skill, I ask him what the<br/>\narguement was all about. The ranger just shakes his head.  Zenia, the<br/>\ncleric, and the ranger begin buffing the party.  The wizard paces,<br/>\nanxiously awaiting the next spawn.  I practice sense heading and forage<br/>\nfor food.  After a short wait, we&#39;re all buffed up and another guard<br/>\nspawns.  We try using the same tactics.  These tactics work much better<br/>\nnow that we have 5 people in the party.  This time only one of us dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nI relearn my songs yet again.  (I can now sing them backwords, in five<br/>\ndifferent keys, while breakdancing)  I return to our little battle<br/>\nground and the ranger announces he must depart.  No one looks<br/>\nsurprised.  Zenia and the cleric begin buffing the party.  Rather than<br/>\npractice sense heading or forage for food I check my inventory.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nmade less than two gold and have ZERO experience to show for any of<br/>\nthis.  The wizard decides to rest very, very near the spawn point.<br/>\nZenia points this out to him.  He dismisses her with a wave of his<br/>\nhand.  Zenia manages to enlist two more adventureres, but before they<br/>\ncan reach us another battle begins.  Two guards and two regular gnolls<br/>\nspawn, and two of our bodies fall to the floor.  With my last breath I<br/>\nlaugh at the fact that the wizard&#39;s fell first.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at Qeynos, I awaken to find the wizard memorizing spells a few feet<br/>\noff.  I sit down next to him and open my songbook.<br/>\nme: Hail.<br/>\nNo response.  I begin relearning my songs.  When I&#39;m done I look over to<br/>\nfind the wizard has left without me.  Spitting Selo&#39;s, I head back to the<br/>\nburrow.  Before reaching the entrance, Zenia asks me to meet up with<br/>\na brave, but young cleric from Erudin.  I spot him and introduce<br/>\nmyself and we wait for Zenia, who is fetching another druid from<br/>\nSurefall.  Meanwhile we receive an informative group tell from the<br/>\nwizard stating that, not only has another guardsman spawned, but that he<br/>\nbelieves he&#39;s within a few kills of level 8.  I reply to the group that<br/>\nI believe I&#39;m within a few deaths of level 6.  Finally Zenia arrives - <br/>\nalone and cursing.<br/>\nme:  Where&#39;s the druid?<br/>\nZenia:  Link dead.  I&#39;ll go get him if he comes back.  For now, let me<br/>\ncast invisibility on you two and will head down.<br/>\nShe casts.  We enter.  We get separated by a train.  I fall into a pool of<br/>\nwater.  I try to find a shore to pull up onto but find it incredibly<br/>\ndifficult to navigate while invisible, particularly with zone&#39;s high lag.<br/>\nI attempt to remove the invisibility, but don&#39;t know how.<br/>\nSurefall Druid:  I&#39;m back.  Where are you?<br/>\nZenia:  I&#39;m coming for you now.<br/>\nme: Umm, got a bit of a problem here.<br/>\nWizard:  Where is everyone??!!<br/>\nZenia:  I&#39;m getting the druid, I&#39;ll be right back.<br/>\nYoung cleric:  Where are you all?<br/>\nZenia:  (to younger cleric) What?  Didn&#39;t you follow me to the others?<br/>\nSurefall Druid:  wtf?<br/>\nOlder cleric:  (to younger cleric) stay where you are, I&#39;m coming.<br/>\nWizard: (to the clerics) There are still some stray gnolls about.<br/>\nRegular ones.  We can take them while waiting for the druids.<br/>\nI finally manage to pull myself up onto a shore, only to discover I&#39;m<br/>\nnow wedged between two rocks. I&#39;m unable to turn or move in any direction.<br/>\nme:  WTF???!!!  Umm, folks, I&#39;ve got a problem.  I&#39;m stuck.  Literally.<br/>\nI&#39;m wedged between two rocks and can&#39;t move.<br/>\nOlder cleric: Where are you?<br/>\nZenia:  Hang on Eve, I&#39;m on my way!<br/>\nSurefall Druid:  WTF???<br/>\nWizard:  Another guard&#39;s just spawned!<br/>\nYoung cleric: Where are the others?<br/>\nme: I&#39;m at &lt;I give my LOC&gt;<br/>\nSurefall Druid: (having just left the group) 6th level druid looking for<br/>\na REAL group!<br/>\nZenia:  Don&#39;t group with him.  He&#39;s impatient.<br/>\nWizard:  Hey, these guards are yellow to me now!<br/>\nOlder cleric:  I can&#39;t find Eve.<br/>\nZenia:  Try jumping or ducking, Eve.<br/>\nI jump.  Nothing happens.  I duck.  I plunge back into the water and<br/>\nback into my previous predicament - swimming while invisible.  I become<br/>\noutstanding in swimming.  Finally invisibilty wears off and I head to<br/>\nshore.  But for some reason everytime I climb up I fall back in AND get<br/>\ninjured by the fall.<br/>\nZenia:  Get up on shore already!<br/>\nme: (taking my hands off the Look Up and Forward keys to reply) I<br/>\ncan&#39;t!  For some reason I keep falling back in!<br/>\nZenia:  Come up for air already!  Why&#39;d you swim back down to the<br/>\nbottom?!<br/>\nI don&#39;t bother to point out that I can&#39;t swim and reply at the same time<br/>\nand instead make more vain attempts to beach myself.  Zenia jumps in the<br/>\nwater, swims up beside me, the climbs back on shore.  I hit the same<br/>\nspot she does, climb up, then fall back in, injuring myself in the<br/>\nprocess.  I try hitting every single spot on the shore.  Finally I hit<br/>\none spot and swim a good ten feet onto dry land before dropping safely<br/>\nto my feet.  Flustered and shivering I follow Zenia back to the rest of<br/>\nthe party.<br/>\nWizard:  OK, I&#39;ll root this guard, Zenia can snare it, then Eve & the<br/>\nclerics can hack away at it.<br/>\nme:  Mind if I put my armor on first?<br/>\nZenia:  Don&#39;t use root.  It isn&#39;t working.<br/>\nOlder cleric:  Umm, I need to leave now.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nstay but, umm, see, the owner of this phone line wants me to get off of<br/>\nit.  There&#39;s nothing I can do.  Sorry.  Bye.<br/>\nWizard:  (Dismissing the older cleric with a wave of his hand) OK Zenia,<br/>\nyou just snare it and I&#39;ll start hitting it with other spells.<br/>\nYoung cleric:  Umm, Eve, do you have a healing song?<br/>\nme: Yeah, but it&#39;s not all that powerful.<br/>\nWizard:  Hey, did I mention these guards are yellow to me now?<br/>\nZenia:  Aye, they&#39;re yellow to me as well.<br/>\nme:  Still red to me.<br/>\nWizard:  I think I can take one by myself.<br/>\nYoung cleric:  You CAN&#39;T take one by yourself!<br/>\nWizard:  (dismissing the young cleric with a wave of his hand)  I really<br/>\ndo believe I can.  Without much difficulty.<br/>\nZenia:  Everytime we&#39;ve attacked others have spawned.  Do you think you<br/>\ncan solo two?<br/>\nWizard: (to cleric) Go over by where Eve is.  I&#39;m going to try soloing<br/>\nthis one.<br/>\nYoung cleric:  You&#39;re going to die...<br/>\nThe young cleric and I back up into the crevaces in the wall as far from<br/>\nthe guardsman as possible.  We have a silent competition to see who can<br/>\nback themselves in further.  Being a wood elf, I win.<br/>\nZenia: At least wait until we&#39;re fully buffed and medded.<br/>\nWizard: (ignoring her) OK, here goes...<br/>\nYoung cleric:  I&#39;m not fully medded!<br/>\nZenia: WAIT!!<br/>\nThe wizard zaps the guard.  It attacks him.  The cleric stands up, takes<br/>\na step forward, then turns and looks to me.  I take a step forward, then<br/>\nturn and look at the cleric.  Another guard spawns.<br/>\nWizard:  HELP! HELP! WIZARD IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!<br/>\nZenia:  RUN!!<br/>\nZenia promptly follows her own advice.  I wait for the cleric to start<br/>\nrunning, but instead he raises his weapon and joins the battle.  I start<br/>\nto flee, then turn back cursing.  I can&#39;t leave the cleric to die.  I<br/>\nbegin to sing.  One of the guards immediately turns to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at Qeynos, Zenia tells me privately that the group will be<br/>\ndisbanding as soon as we get all the corpses back.  I check my<br/>\ninventory.  Just under 3 gold, a couple patches of fur, and one copper<br/>\nring are all I have to show for the evening.  No experience.  I arrive<br/>\nback at our hunting grounds and the wizard leaves the party.  There is<br/>\nmuch rejoicing.  We make our apologies to the cleric, hoping to one day<br/>\nfight with him again under better circumstances.  Then Zenia and I head<br/>\nback to the hills.  On our way back to Qeynos a wolf begins nipping at<br/>\nme.  I turn and stab at it, then remember I&#39;m in the company of a<br/>\ndruid.  I advice we make a dash to the zone before I find myself<br/>\nknitting some small patchwork.  Zenia laughs.  I laugh.  Cros laughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nL8R<br/>\nEvulia, bard gone soloist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
