I&#39;ve posted it to both the Concert<br/>\nHall board as well as the eqbards mailing list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have played a bard since April 1999.  I have followed all bard related<br/>\nissues since that time.  I am fully aware of Verant&#39;s position that bard<br/>\nsongs with haste components are not intended to stack with enchanter/shaman<br/>\nhaste line of spells.  However, it is my opinion it would be worth the<br/>\neffort of the bard community to try to change Verant&#39;s mind one more time<br/>\nbefore the final tuning changes are made.  In the past this might have been<br/>\nwasted effort on our part.  However, based on the fact that Aradune<br/>\ncurrently appears to be open to suggestions on how to improve the game, this<br/>\ntime around we may get better results.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis entire proposal is based on the rationale that while our haste songs<br/>\nhave spell-like effects, they should NOT be treated as spells for stacking<br/>\npurposes.  Our voices alone inspire our comrades to fight better.  There is<br/>\nno &quot;magic&quot; involved.  As a result, a bard song that has a haste component<br/>\n(Anthem, Celerity, Berserker, etc) should stack with the enchanter and<br/>\nshaman haste line of spells (Augmentation, Celerity, Swift Like Wind, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of ways to do this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOption 1).  Apply 100% of the bard haste bonus in addition to the<br/>\nenchanter/shaman bonus.  This may be overpowering so a compromise would be<br/>\nOption 2.  <br/>\nOption 2).  Apply a portion, perhaps 50%, of the bard haste bonus in<br/>\naddition to the enchanter/shaman bonus.  For example, Anthem provides a 10%<br/>\nhaste bonus.  Under this scenario, while an enchanter/shaman haste buff is<br/>\nin effect, Anthem would provide an additional 5% haste bonus (in addition to<br/>\nthe other stat bonuses it provides.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is a lot more radical but I figured I would throw it out<br/>\nthere as well for discussion.  Each class in EQ is generally considered to<br/>\nbe the &quot;best&quot; in one aspect of the game.  As we all know, bards are<br/>\nconsidered the best at reducing downtime as well as running speed.  This is<br/>\nall fine and dandy and something I can live with.  However, IMO, bards<br/>\nshould be the best class in the game when it comes to &quot;inspiring&quot; our<br/>\ngroupmates in combat.  This is an aspect of bards that can be found in every<br/>\npiece of fantasy literature relating to bards.  This &quot;inspiration&quot; is in the<br/>\nform of haste buffs since they have a much bigger impact on combat than<br/>\nprimary stat buffs.  So it is my opinion that bard songs that provide a<br/>\nhaste buff should be BETTER than enchanter/shaman buffs.  You end up with<br/>\nsomething along the lines of this:<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 3)  Double the current haste bonus of all bard songs but continue to<br/>\nenforce the stacking rules with enchanter/shaman spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither of these three options would be something that benefits every class<br/>\nin the game.  So in terms of garnering public support, this should be fairly<br/>\neasy to do.  The first two options do not impede on the abilities of the<br/>\nenchanter or shaman classes in any way so they would have no reason to<br/>\ncomplain.  Option 3 would render enchanter/shaman haste buffs obsolete when<br/>\ngrouping with a bard but once again these are not &quot;class defining&quot; abilities<br/>\nof these classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the hard part is convincing Verant to adopt either one of the<br/>\nthree options.  I&#39;m no programmer, but I would imagine the actual coding<br/>\npart would not be difficult at all.  I have read reports that the two new<br/>\nErvaj songs, instead of functioning as mana drains, provide a minor haste<br/>\nbuff that stacks with enchanter/shaman haste spells.  If that is actually<br/>\nthe case, then Verant already knows how to change the code to make all of<br/>\nour haste songs stack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I request everyone&#39;s feedback on this proposal.  If anyone thinks they<br/>\nhave a better idea that is more likely to get approved by Verant then feel<br/>\nfree to make a recommendation.  Once I get enough feedback, I will rewrite<br/>\nthe proposal and post it to both the Concert Hall board and eqbards mailing<br/>\nlist as many times as necessary until the majority of us agree on its<br/>\nwording.  I am also more than willing to let a more well known bard present<br/>\nthis proposal to Verant.  Who that may be I leave up to the bard community<br/>\nto decide.  Kaearia  comes to mind since he has probably done more research<br/>\non how our songs work that any other bard who has played the game.  Thott<br/>\nalso comes to mind since he appears to know someone who works for Verant. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin Randayn<br/>\nBard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
