Party effect, Range: Zone wide.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uhhhh... do you honestly think they&#39;ll allow this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not? I can weave Selo&#39;s and Aria now. Why not throw in a song that would<br/>\njust be plain fun and make group travel much easier?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A new charm song, if not full charm then atleast a charm animal song (make<br/>\n&gt; this one 44th or 49th)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Charm animal is utterly useless (and pointless) for a bard.  90% of the<br/>\nzones we go to do not have animals high enough to bother with.  Remember<br/>\nthat our charm is already limited by the fact that we have to re-charm every<br/>\n10-15 seconds.  This would be better as our 39th song as well since we<br/>\n&quot;lose&quot; our charm at 37.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm animal useless?  Talk to the druids in Sol B that charm sonic bats all<br/>\nnight long.....<br/>\nAlso the expansion is going to have high level outdoor zones.  I am sure<br/>\nthere will be some 50+ animals to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Sonic Disruption<br/>\n&gt; Target: Single<br/>\n&gt; Brass (required)<br/>\n&gt; Disrupts all spell casting from target.<br/>\n&gt; This could also be interesting as an AE song as well.

But that<br/>\nmight be a bit overpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 50 plus songs:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Dance of Death<br/>\n&gt; AE or Single<br/>\n&gt; Brass<br/>\n&gt; DoT + drain severe stamina drain(at least the equiv of a full bubble) +<br/>\n&gt; chance to interrupt any spell casting<br/>\n&gt; Dot should be twice as strong as Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation at the same<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nice!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Niv&#39;s Chrorus of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; String Required<br/>\n&gt; 2xHymn of Restoration + Fatigue restoral + 1.5xCassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>\n&gt; Clarity.<br/>\n&gt; Fully stacks with Hymn of Restoration, Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Niv&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Melody of Preservation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting but I think this would be far too powerful.  twice hymn + jig +<br/>\nclarity?  uhh.... and stackable?<br/>\n<br/>\nhymn x 2 at 50th would = 35 a tick healing.
