I know in closed quarters I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; rather pull out<br/>\n&gt; my lower level necro then to use my bard, my bard got ganked 2-3 times<br/>\n&gt; getting my prod for HS key just cause I got lost on the way <br/>\n&gt; out of the maze<br/>\n&gt; (dumb dumb) and I couldnt go toe to toe with him or pull him <br/>\n&gt; out of the maze<br/>\n&gt; properly either, really irritating.  After much aggravation I <br/>\n&gt; logged in my<br/>\n&gt; necro and went after him. The pet kept the whole room empty <br/>\n&gt; without losing<br/>\n&gt; any hp, when the named spawned I unloaded all my mana on it <br/>\n&gt; as I wanted<br/>\n&gt; payback for the aggravation he&#39;d given me.  I also had alot <br/>\n&gt; of fun there<br/>\n&gt; though with Antic (ya remember him dont ya) pulling as many <br/>\n&gt; as I could and<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;d AE them, that was truly fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But on a soloing front, I&#39;d say outdoors bards are great, <br/>\n&gt; indoors I&#39;d rather<br/>\n&gt; not even think about it untill I have more AC or my epic or something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; 55 bard<br/>\n&gt; RIP<br/>\n&gt; A Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: August 23, 2001 6:15 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm well I can see your point, and  probably haven&#39;t noticed <br/>\n&gt; it because I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been on many raids with my bard.  But the shammy <br/>\n&gt; getting exp on<br/>\n&gt; raids? *dies laughing*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I would like to see is raid platinum distribution <br/>\n&gt; myself.  In a month<br/>\n&gt; of guild hunts, I&#39;ve not seen a single pp... yet those rogues <br/>\n&gt; and rangers<br/>\n&gt; &quot;give it all to the guild&quot; - yeah, right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone tells me that bards are bad at soloing, and that <br/>\n&gt; shaman are the<br/>\n&gt; best.  I can solo 10 times better with my bard.  Personally, <br/>\n&gt; I think its<br/>\n&gt; because people are very poor at picking out &quot;soloable&quot; areas and mobs.<br/>\n&gt; What a shaman can solo, a mage will crumple on, etc.  I guess <br/>\n&gt; I tend to look<br/>\n&gt; at things like how long actual downtime is, the ability to <br/>\n&gt; handle multiple<br/>\n&gt; mobs and play with a variety of classees rather than just <br/>\n&gt; damage dealing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kinda funny how things are on other servers and other guilds, <br/>\n&gt; SK&#39;s are like<br/>\n&gt; the joke of our guild.

We are fairly weak at soloing and not <br/>\n&gt; very good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage dealers in groups. More over, we are weak in raids. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree with Aftathott on this one. Verant did a very good <br/>\n&gt; &gt; job balancing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bards in solo and group situations. But we are far less <br/>\n&gt; &gt; valuable in raid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Raids are one area VI should definitely spend some time on before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; releasing Luclin. I hope they address XP in raids, class <br/>\n&gt; &gt; balance in raids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and communication (chat) in raids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; More and more of the game is around raids where the top <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior, Rogue,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shammy, Chanter and Cleric take the XP. The 6th spot is very <br/>\n&gt; &gt; likely a Monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for pulling, but mages, wizzies and SKs are all more <br/>\n&gt; &gt; preferred than Bards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tzeetch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Commune, Xegony <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ugh....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; keeping a low<br/>\n&gt; &gt; profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice.
