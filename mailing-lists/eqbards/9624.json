Klug&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sklug@...\">sklug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello everyone.  Last night I had a disappointing fiasco in Solusek.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got together a good group and went in to get my two bard quest items.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We headed for the king room, and managed to break the spawn (thank you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lament).  We camped the room for about 4 hours.  Almost everyone in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group had some quest item they wanted, and I was the only bard.  Well,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to make a long story short, after killing at least 25 solusek champions,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5 sol mages, 6 sol shamans, 25ish inferno goblins.  Not a single one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us got a quest item.  Are these supposed to be that rare?  Are we just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the wrong place to find these items or what?  We got a couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mediocre items off the king, but I didn&#39;t get any of them (lost the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; roll).  To add insult to injury, just as I was saying I needed to go (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had already stayed up 2 hours late), we had a bad pull, and half of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; died.  And I awoke to......Greater Feydark.  Heh... Oops.  Thank god for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; revive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any insight?  Did they nerf it with the latest patch or something?  Or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has it always been this rare for them to drop the quest items?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frustrated,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laluni Songhammer, Level 29 bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Steven S.
