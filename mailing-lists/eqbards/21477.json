Now, with the GM&#39;s comment<br/>\nabout not supposed to be there for 6 months, I finally understand.<br/>\nDispite their protests to the contrary, Verant relies on this stupidity<br/>\nto slow the players down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Sep 19/00, &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>\n&gt; imbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.
