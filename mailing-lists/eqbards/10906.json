I could care less whether another player<br/>\nhas better equipment than I do (I&#39;m gonna try to get<br/>\nthe best I can myself).  You are what you do.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen lvl 7 dwarves in full bronze with an<br/>\nexecutioner&#39;s axe running around orc hill kill<br/>\nstealing.  No one except another KewLDooD will respect<br/>\nthat player and when he gets to the level that he must<br/>\ngroup to succeed, he&#39;s toast.  He won&#39;t have learned<br/>\nthe lessons he needs to to compete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you (figuratively) expect me to respect you because<br/>\nof your equipment, forget about it.  If you expect me<br/>\nto respect you because you are good in a fight,<br/>\nbecause you are helpful to players at a lower level<br/>\nthan you, or because you RP a bard well, rest assured<br/>\nI will.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my untwinked 2cp,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin,<br/>\nBard of the 14th Song<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nMay your days be filled with light,<br/>\nand your nights with song <br/>\n<br/>\n--- JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38<br/>\n&gt; days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>\n&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not*<br/>\n&gt; fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk<br/>\n&gt; up to 23rd and an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing<br/>\n&gt; that the best class in<br/>\n&gt; the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent,<br/>\n&gt; dual Ykeshas, Flowing Black<br/>\n&gt; Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked<br/>\n&gt; out like a level 50<br/>\n&gt; that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago<br/>\n&gt; I saw a level 15 in<br/>\n&gt; full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other<br/>\n&gt; goodies as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly*<br/>\n&gt; discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor<br/>\n&gt; that I have and I *still*<br/>\n&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on<br/>\n&gt; the sands of Oasis,<br/>\n&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his<br/>\n&gt; bard last weekend.  Not<br/>\n&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having<br/>\n&gt; 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>\n&gt; being level 50.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39;<br/>\n&gt; characters to differentiate<br/>\n&gt; themselves from one another other based upon level<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. time and effort<br/>\n&gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want,<br/>\n&gt; when people look at me,<br/>\n&gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many<br/>\n&gt; times to achieve the<br/>\n&gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to<br/>\n&gt; assume that I bought it from<br/>\n&gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked<br/>\n&gt; myself with it.  I am now<br/>\n&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO<br/>\n&gt; DROP it would be a<br/>\n&gt; different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would<br/>\n&gt; have been in steel<br/>\n&gt; probably and I would have something tangible and<br/>\n&gt; visual over him based upon<br/>\n&gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know*<br/>\n&gt; that I had earned the<br/>\n&gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had<br/>\n&gt; pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled<br/>\n&gt; Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>\n&gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; being NO DROP has reduced my<br/>\n&gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing<br/>\n&gt; playing a game that makes me<br/>\n&gt; feel this way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
