So i quickly run over to my druid that is pulling, charm the gnome<br/>\n&gt; over and over.... Oh dear, mr kill stealer which just blew all his mana<br/>\n&gt; seems pissed and is threatening to call a gm on us. By all means mr kill<br/>\n&gt; stealer, call a gm to report us for stealing our gnome back.  Funny thing<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; that this guy allready got a warning in the past cause of the same<br/>\n&gt; situation<br/>\n&gt; in highkeep once and was talking to the guide for over an hour when that<br/>\n&gt; happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tHe quickly left the zone after all this happened. Seems that no one<br/>\n&gt; wants to mess with a bard hehe.  My friends love me now that im 32, with<br/>\n&gt; charm im the ultimate tool against want to be stealers, and i have mana<br/>\n&gt; regen now, life was sweet last night. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tMinkin <br/>\n&gt; \tSol Ro<br/>\n&gt; \tlev 32 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tP.S. I wish there was Dark elf bards, because i love being evil<br/>\n&gt; sometimes </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
