This is my first &quot;eqbards&quot; email I have received I hope<br/>\nthey are all as well written and interesting to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n50+ zones good for pick-up groups?  I have formed several fruitful pickup<br/>\ngroups in Skyshrine and I have formed several total disasters.  This is a<br/>\nzone that definitely requires people to listen well and know their role.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quick comment on the Power lvl&#39;d remark.  You only remember the bad ones<br/>\nbecause the good ones don&#39;t say a thing about it.  You could say my warrior<br/>\nis power lvl&#39;d.  Or you could say he grouped exclusively with my enchanter<br/>\nfrom 1 to 45.  I think I started playing her mostly in &quot;regular&quot; groups<br/>\naround 45 or 46 something like that.  All skills maxed with the exception of<br/>\n2hb ( I didnt have a descent one the entire time so I didnt spend too much<br/>\ntime on it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\nTeenimu<br/>\n55 Enchanter<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blitz Krieg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 21, 2001 7:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Ding 60!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a screenshot of the big finale. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/darkfox021/Ding60.JPG\">http://www.geocities.com/darkfox021/Ding60.JPG</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the congrats. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for tips for leveling:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe (my GF plays next to me in RL) tried to avoid pickup groups as much as<br/>\npossible after around level 45, but rather tried to rely on creating groups<br/>\nwith people we knew were competent and dependable.  (The only way to find<br/>\nthose people is to join or start pickup groups and keep track of the good<br/>\nteam players and seek them out for future groups... And people you enjoy<br/>\nbeing around!!!!  I can&#39;t stress that enough!)  Once you have a balanced (or<br/>\nsemi-balanced, we&#39;re bards afterall and can fill a few gaps :p) group of<br/>\ncompetent players you can head just about anywhere.  50+ we spent mass<br/>\namounts of time at the zone-in in Chardok, various places in Sebilis,<br/>\nBurning Woods, Skyfire, Trak&#39;s Teeth, etc.  Once Song of Twilight was fixed<br/>\n(we have never had a reliable enchanter to group with) we started doing<br/>\nHowling Stones - I think I was high 53 or low 54 at the time.  Around 55, we<br/>\nspent a great deal of time in the Crypt in Sebilis trying for a BoH.  About<br/>\nthis time we decided to conc!<br/>\nentrate on getting experience an<br/>\nd sacrificing some major raid type stuff (Kael for Thurgadin armor pieces)<br/>\nto do so.  56+ was almost ALL done in Howling Stones, but it almost requires<br/>\nhaving your group set up prior to zoning in.  When you start taking people<br/>\nto underpopulated dungeons with excellent rewards (exp!), they start seeking<br/>\nyou out.  We normally have the problem of not having enough group slots for<br/>\nall the friends who want to join us on a given night :/.  Although, we<br/>\noccasionally have the problem of not having a key class to do something...<br/>\nBut, that turns into an opportunity to meet more people  (/w all lfg 50<br/>\n60)... it&#39;s a risk for that evening, but it could pay off in droves if they<br/>\nprove to be competent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of that whole networking for groups kinda thing can be done within a<br/>\nguild, but don&#39;t limit yourself there.  We were unguilded (by specific<br/>\nchoice) until around level 45 and knew many many people from a variety of<br/>\ndifferent guilds that we considered friends.  I rarely looked at guild tags<br/>\nprior to 45 (seems odd now, because that&#39;s one of the first things I notice<br/>\nnow, hehe) and still don&#39;t care or hold it against someone if they belong to<br/>\na certain guild or not... I&#39;ll care or hold it against them if they turn out<br/>\nto be a jerk or repeatedly do something completely stupid to get evefyone<br/>\nkilled.  People make mistakes (I have made many that&#39;s gotten me and the<br/>\nwhole group killed, heh), but you can tell when it&#39;s done with good intent<br/>\nbut just a f-up or when it&#39;s due to extreme incompetence or apathy..<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to make a long story short, I wouldn&#39;t recommend pickup groups as a long<br/>\nterm strategy.. find people you like and trust and see the world with them.<br/>\nOnce you know everyone knows their role, you can go anywhere you want and do<br/>\nfine.  (Stay away from twinks who have been powerleveled.. they usually<br/>\ndon&#39;t know their role!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  BTW, if you have any tips for us on places you loved to hunt from 50 on<br/>\nup, <br/>\n  I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to hear about it. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t have to worry<br/>\n<br/>\n  about pick-up groups, but I&#39;m also wondering if there are any 50+ zones <br/>\n  where you can find a pick-up group and not die repeatedly. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
