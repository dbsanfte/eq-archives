After 1 get the &quot;your wounds are begining to heal&quot; <br/>\nmessage I start Jonathan&#39;s and then repeat. Sometimes I take a <br/>\nrest after each Jonathan&#39;s as it is the &quot;primary&quot; song.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I get it just right I can keep the 2 Constant songs and get a pulse <br/>\never so often as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe effects of Anthem dont last as long as Jonathan&#39;s, so that <br/>\nstrategy does not work as well with Anthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am better off stacking just Jonathan&#39;s and Anthem at this <br/>\nstage. Like you suggested in another post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn I have a question,<br/>\nDoes the after effects of songs get longer as you go up in levels? <br/>\nAn after effect is when the song icon is displayed but you are now <br/>\nsinging a different song.<br/>\n<br/>\nT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Walsh, Video Coding Group<br/>\nTeltec Ireland, DCU, Dublin 9, Ireland<br/>\nTel     : +353-1-7045477<br/>\nFAX     : +353-1-7045092<br/>\nE-mail  : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:walsht@...\">walsht@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
