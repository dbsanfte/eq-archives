I wish I<br/>\nhad gone 13 levels ago (as soon as I got Sonorous Clouding). When I walked<br/>\ninto lower Guk, turned the first corner, see Shin Corpse on ground, click,<br/>\ngreaves. Joined a group in the bedroom and killed Undead Shin Knights, 2nd<br/>\nknight, gloves. (forgive me if I have switched these, can&#39;t remember which<br/>\ndropped what)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, My advice to young bards, Get a map, enter Guk, go invis, trot down to<br/>\nLower Guk and wait. I could have looted 2 more gloves and greaves from<br/>\ncorpses at the exit. Plus, even if you can&#39;t complete the quests just yet,<br/>\nthe gloves(AC 7,+5poison Wt5) and greaves(AC 10,+5disease,Wt7.7) are nice<br/>\n(plus they look cool).<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n32nd Bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n\tExcellent advice Uldar, I got mine at 16 when I was fighting Heart<br/>\nSpiders for silk and xp.  When I got poisoned I just ran down to Lower while<br/>\nplaying Hymn.  having never killed a froggie, and not being agnostic (they<br/>\nhate people who can&#39;t decide apparently) the frogloks all ignored me.  Got<br/>\nboth Shin items for free which was a decent armor upgrade in the case of the<br/>\ngreaves from my barbed legs.  Also got several fine steel weapons no one<br/>\nwanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
