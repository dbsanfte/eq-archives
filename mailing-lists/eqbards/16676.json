Bats/ <br/>\nbugs etc  aren&#39;t charmable, and now guk is a joke. I haven&#39;t been back there <br/>\nin months. Sure, upgraded song would allow us to charm higher level things, <br/>\nbut I am hoping for all new songs, not just rehashes. But oh well, replying <br/>\nto this is pretty pointless. . I love how because I post my views on how I <br/>\nwould like to play in the expansion it is &quot;wrong&quot;.  I think your post is <br/>\nobvious flame bait. What level are you ? sign your posts please, I honestly <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to reply seeing as I have no idea where you are coming from.  <br/>\n        Bleh , go camp something , that seems to be what makes you happy. <br/>\nFine, I was just saying I would like songs with both form and function. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t play to camp anymore, I play for friends, for raids, and to help out <br/>\nlower level people. I will prolly stay on longer if at least a couple of our <br/>\nsongs had some sort of RP applicable aspect to them ( the illusion one being <br/>\na great one ) but I doubt you know what RP is , nor have any interest in it. <br/>\n        Good luck , get 50 ( you win ! ) then get 60 ( you win ! ) then quit <br/>\nand go back to Quake.<br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firsesong <br/>\n&quot;this is not helping my faith in sticking around in this game&quot;<br/>\n50 bard tunare.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
