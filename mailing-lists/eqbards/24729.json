Not to the <br/>\npoint where our puller intentionally pulled multiples, but in a bad <br/>\nsituation, it was very handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have loused up using charm a couple of different ways (usually when I&#39;m <br/>\ntired), however. First, I forget to retarget my pet. I end up charming his <br/>\ntarget and really confuse my party. Second, I&#39;ve had the wrong version of <br/>\ncharm memed. I had accidentally mem&#39;ed Song of the Sirens and was <br/>\nbewildered for some time as to why everything resisted charm. I was <br/>\nobviously too tired to understand the &quot;mob is too high a level to be <br/>\ncharmed&quot; message until after we ran to the zone one time. I decided it was <br/>\ntime to log and get some sleep after that. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wouldn&#39;t give up on charm. When I first acquired charm it took a <br/>\nlot of practice before I got comfortable with it as it takes a lot of work <br/>\nto get used to the timing. Then again, it&#39;s always good to play to your <br/>\nstrengths. If you&#39;re a great mezz&#39;er and love it, then no real need to work <br/>\non your charming skills. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:28 PM 5/14/01 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hmm, I&#39;m not exactly sure what my cha is, but I&#39;m pretty sure its under 125,<br/>\n&gt;and I dont have too much trouble messing something.  I SUCK at charming,<br/>\n&gt;find it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>\n&gt;mana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>\n&gt;reliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>\n&gt;nivs and try to mitigate damage.  But thats just me, maybe I need to learn<br/>\n&gt;the right way to charm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tani, 51st Bard<br/>\n&gt;Halana, 60th Shammy<br/>\n&gt;Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: John Grady [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 2:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Charm Change<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree but that it doesn&#39;t ruin charm kiting, just makes it more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult. I hate reaching over to the F8 key in between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; selo, restoration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and re-targeting pet. Just one more finger stretching operation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CHA and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez?
