I don&#39;t think the events start out as stupid.  I think<br/>\nthe actions of the 40+&#39;s that come in and destroy an event clearly far below<br/>\ntheir level make them stupid.  I would have thought that Verant would have<br/>\nfound a way around this by now.  I can&#39;t imagine that the guides/gms don&#39;t<br/>\ncomplain about it every time they run one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is the players.  I just think the gm&#39;s need to be given<br/>\na tool to allow them to more easily prevent the players from causing<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\nOne of the events I was at was clearly intended to provide quite a challenge<br/>\nfor 20 or more characters of 15th level or so.  However two 40+ characters<br/>\ncame in and killed 90% of the event npc&#39;s.  I say 90% because some might<br/>\nhave escaped their wrath, though I personally didn&#39;t see any.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nUhh that&#39;s not true at all.  Casual gamers are generally still interested in<br/>\nbeing able to participate in quests and adventures to attain neat or unique<br/>\nitems.  I would hazard that most &quot;Casual&quot; gamers would even like to some day<br/>\nreach high levels.  Even Role Players like to reach high levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll players should be able to participate in events.  The problem that I<br/>\nhave with most GM event&#39;s isn&#39;t that they are &quot;Stupid&quot;, however, it&#39;s that<br/>\nunless the GM&#39;s get very &quot;evil&quot; and start punting players who interfere<br/>\nthere is no way for a dynamic event to keep the 50&#39;s from ruining the fun of<br/>\nlow level events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a Guide and I can tell you that MANY of the events are actually aimed<br/>\nat those around level 15 to 35 or so.  The problem is  that whenever one of<br/>\nthose events kicks off the 50&#39;s waltz in and blast the actors to smitherines<br/>\nbecause they think it may have neat stuff.  Which ruins the event for the<br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me rephrase that:<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the GM&#39;s fault that the PLAYERS can&#39;t respect events enough not to<br/>\nruin it for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBuy and sell used, rare and vintage gear at the Web&#39;s best<br/>\nmusic gear auction.
