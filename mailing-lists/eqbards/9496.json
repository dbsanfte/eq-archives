This is<br/>\nmuch, much different the pof, and imo makes the poh much safer. Spawn is<br/>\nalso faster than 12 hours, unlike the pof, WE THINK. Some funky things<br/>\ngoing on with tracking and we are not positive. We have killed quite a few<br/>\nthings so far, and are fairly deep in. Right now we just got slaughtered<br/>\nwhen our fearless puller brought one too many fetid fiends (well not fetid<br/>\nfiends, they look the same, have a different name that i keep forgetting,<br/>\nspent far too long in the pof :) AND the maestro of rancor. The maestro had<br/>\na mace, im hoping the bardic mace of ultimate slaying :), hopefully we will<br/>\nfind out later heh, right now we just finished corpse retrieval and are<br/>\nrebuffing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSPOILERS (well more so than above anyways :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwe found a kick ass enchanters robe that looks like cryosilk but is deep<br/>\nblue (bleh imo). Stats are incredible, will show up on the spoiler sights i<br/>\nam sure. Found a crappy wizard wand, and we found the kiraikuei (zombie<br/>\nmonks) drop indocilite, the forsaken revanants dropped the enchanters robe,<br/>\nand the clerics of innoruk drop, surprise, ethereal armour. Thats all i can<br/>\nthink of for now, we are attemping to locate the maestro since he is no<br/>\nlonger back at his organ anymore.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
