As a wood elf, I have <br/>\n&gt; infravision so can<br/>\n&gt; normally see fine at night.  However, whenever I activate the <br/>\n&gt; DE illusion,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m blind as a bat (i.e. I lose infravision and don&#39;t gain <br/>\n&gt; ultravision).  I<br/>\n&gt; have had shamans buff me with the Ultravision spell and I <br/>\n&gt; have also had<br/>\n&gt; magicians give me a Coldstone to equip so I know what Ultravision is<br/>\n&gt; supposed to look like.  The difference at night when I have <br/>\n&gt; either of these<br/>\n&gt; two buffs versus the vision I have with the DE illusion is <br/>\n&gt; literally the<br/>\n&gt; difference between night and day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So is the Mask of Deception supposed to also give you <br/>\n&gt; ultravision?  I have<br/>\n&gt; talked with enchanters who regularly cast the DE illusion spell on<br/>\n&gt; themselves so they can see at night.  Is it possible that <br/>\n&gt; this component of<br/>\n&gt; the Mask of Deception is broken?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
