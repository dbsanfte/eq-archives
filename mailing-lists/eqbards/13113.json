Anyway, the observations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My equipment:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Icy greaves, Froglok Crown, Vox Bracer (i gave one away), 2 <br/>\n  Peridot plat rings, Runed Bone Fork, Cloak of the Ice bear,<br/>\n  Imbrued Boots, misc Lambent bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Total cold base:      119<br/>\n  Total cold w/ spell:  159<br/>\n  Total cold w/ song:   222<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reso, SoW, Naltron. (~2000 hp)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You are blasted by freezing winds.  ~800 hp poof, gone.<br/>\n  I&#39;d have to estimate the other tanks in the group were taking the <br/>\n  same breath weapon damage, with only 140 total cold.  Take that<br/>\n  as you may.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What did make the difference was two clerics chain group healing.<br/>\n  And while I still speculate that the random generator&#39;s involvement<br/>\n  in how much breath damage you take is large, I can assert that it<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t hurt to beef up your cold, if nothing more than to show off.  <br/>\n  (I had the highest base cold there)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bard Dragon Tactic Observations:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * Never face the dragon.  This cuts visual lag by 50% easy.<br/>\n    And before you say upgrade your computer, I have a P3-450<br/>\n    with a Diamond V770 32MB TNT2 Ultra video card in 640x480<br/>\n    no graphic options on... It was laggy, Period.<br/>\n<br/>\n  * Twisting is almost impossible, you have to count and twist<br/>\n    in order to get the songs running.  If you wait for the visual<br/>\n    or textual cue, it&#39;s too late.  If you don&#39;t face the dragon,<br/>\n    twisting is a helluva lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n  * I did not melee, otherwise I was asking the dragon to kill me.<br/>\n    I stayed out of dragon melee range, and in my party&#39;s song <br/>\n    radius range.  Vox never melee&#39;d me once, although one giant<br/>\n    that spawned kept freaking bashing my song off.  Annoying.<br/>\n    Although Vox was moving around a lot, I had to compensate to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  These all may be due to the number of people and the place Vox<br/>\n  was pulled to.  Tight quarters and lots of people never goes<br/>\n  well with EQ.  It never has since beta.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I followed pretty much what everyone here said to do.  The battle<br/>\n  was fairly smooth I suppose.  If you call throwing 48 people at a<br/>\n  dragon, smooth.  heh.  Only a few people died, I don&#39;t know why<br/>\n  or under what circumstances, but two of the melee groups had no<br/>\n  bard, and they did just fine.  The rogue died I know, after throwing<br/>\n  a few BS&#39;s in.  And a couple of tanks who weren&#39;t getting the proper<br/>\n  healing, too.  No one in my group died, or LD&#39;d - thank god.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I expected to cut 50-75% AE breath weapon, and I didn&#39;t notice<br/>\n  any big difference between 220ish cold and 140ish cold.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Screenshots (will only be up for a bit, if someone wants to copy<br/>\n               the Vox one somewhere else they can):<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.decipher.com/ryan/voxdead.jpg\">http://www2.decipher.com/ryan/voxdead.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone mentioned Oggok bouncers as good exp?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.decipher.com/ryan/level50.jpg\">http://www2.decipher.com/ryan/level50.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
