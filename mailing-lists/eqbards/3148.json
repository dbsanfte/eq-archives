You CAN carry a weapon and an instrument at the<br/>\nsame time, the problem is you can&#39;t use the weapon in a conventional way.<br/>\nBefore I got dual wield I would put my mino axe in my range weapon slot and<br/>\nmy intrument in my secondary mellee slot.  This gave the appearance that I<br/>\nwas carrying a weapon and an instrument.  Too bad the only way I could use<br/>\nthe weapon would be to throw it at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill at all? I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I am doing it<br/>\nwrong. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
