This is useful for saving on weight, i carry 20<br/>\nof one item, less weight than carrying 5 of 4 items. Also is good when i<br/>\nactually find someone who needs food (just foraging I usually have 60<br/>\nfood or more at all times) i can give it to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, you know that message &quot;you cannot try to forage while attacking&quot;?<br/>\nwell, you CAN try, you just can&#39;t succeed. I have forage hotkeyed on my<br/>\nmain combat hotkeys. Occasionally i have hit it during combat<br/>\naccidently.
