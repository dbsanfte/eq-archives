It think there is<br/>\none extraordinarily difficult resist check to see if you can<br/>\ntake zero damage from the spell.  Then there is another resist<br/>\ncheck to determine how much damage you take.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night while completing the Staff of the Observers quest,<br/>\nI ran across a goblin wizard in Butcherblock.  These guys<br/>\nkilled me way too often when I was level 5-7 so I decided to<br/>\ntoy around with him a bit.  I used Curtail (L30 song, targeted<br/>\nDoT) on him to kill him - no melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the entire fight, he peppered me with spells (they sure<br/>\nhave got a lot of mana - I&#39;d estimate 20-30 spells).  Most of<br/>\nthem only took off 4 or 5 points damage, but a couple did<br/>\nabout 20.  Then on one spell, I saw a &quot;You resist the...&quot;<br/>\nmessage and took no damage.  I had *never* seen that message<br/>\nfor a DD prior to last night (I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>\noffhand but it was a fire-based DD spell).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>\none complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>\ndifficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>\nthe time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>\nin the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>\nit may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
