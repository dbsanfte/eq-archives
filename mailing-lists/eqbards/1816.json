I am curious as to what Verant did with the &quot;Freddy<br/>\nKreuger&quot; type weapon, i.e. does it just appear as a dagger, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave up a long time ago caring about the fact that my hand drum looks like<br/>\na flute, but I certainly hope that we get some major graphical improvements<br/>\nsomewhere along the line to correct some of the quirks like these that we<br/>\nexperience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw one the other day when I bought some cheapo little throwing daggers<br/>\nand equipped them in my range attack slot...I was holding a Shiney Brass<br/>\nShield (PENDING LORE BTW) and a Combine LS and when I put the tiny daggers<br/>\nin Range attack my Shield and Sword disappeared from my external camera view<br/>\n(F9) and it looked like I was just holding a dagger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was grouped with a ranger about a week ago in the Oasis and for some<br/>\nreason the graphic for his Banded Coif was not showing up even though it was<br/>\nequipped on him - I actually thought that was kind of neat, getting to have<br/>\nthe armor but not having to see it, especially since I am not all that fond<br/>\nof the banded graphical interpretation on Half-Elves like myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras of Qeynos<br/>\nHalf-Elf Bard<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
