My inventory was full from having<br/>\n&gt; adventured for 4 or 5 days without visiting a merchant, so I refreshed my<br/>\nDE<br/>\n&gt; illusion, memmed Carillon and went to Tin Merchant IX in the Overthere.  I<br/>\n&gt; switched out my weapons for the drum to run there.  There wasn&#39;t a slot<br/>\nopen<br/>\n&gt; so I just left my Wraith Bone Hammer floating on the pointer.  I know, I<br/>\n&gt; know, I should&#39;ve destroyed some muffins or carried them on the pointer.<br/>\n&gt; Hindsight is 20/20.  Anyway I left clicked on the merchant to target him<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; the Carillon and the trade window came up.  I cancelled the trade and the<br/>\n&gt; Hammer dropped to the ground and the merchant picked it up and destroyed<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt; I had Nodrop set to confirm.  I immediately petitioned it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Guide after some discussion promoted my petition to the Senior Guide.<br/>\n&gt; The Senior Guide spoke to me Tuesday night, he wasn&#39;t online on Monday,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; asked where and when the event occurred.
