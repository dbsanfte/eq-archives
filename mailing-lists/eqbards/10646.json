I didn&#39;t seem to run that<br/>\n&gt; much faster, and I couldn&#39;t find a percussion song that had a<br/>\n&gt; quantifiable effect increase. Is this due to the recent patch <br/>\n&gt; issue that<br/>\n&gt; affected MM drum and selo&#39;s? Or can someone reccommend a song <br/>\n&gt; I can play<br/>\n&gt; to see the difference?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Uldar Ulfangson </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
