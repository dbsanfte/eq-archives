A few came<br/>\nin at 5, then a few more around 10, more still somewhere between 10 and<br/>\n20, and at 20 most of the &quot;standard&quot; race languages were available for<br/>\ntraining (gnomish, elvish, etc).  I&#39;d love to train them someday, but no<br/>\ndoubt it would take a while by someone who does know it (don&#39;t know if<br/>\nit&#39;s possible to raise skill simply by speaking in it).  After about 20<br/>\nminutes of nonstop spamming from a 6-line /g social, my Elvish is &quot;very<br/>\ngood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that you must zone before language improvements take effect, at least<br/>\nfrom learning by ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you wondered what to do with all your practice points. -.-<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, progress in progress</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
