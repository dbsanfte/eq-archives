I&#39;m usually online<br/>\nfrom 5p-1a EST during the week and then 24/7 on the weekends. (*ahem*<br/>\nbelieve it or not, I do have a life mixed in there.. hehe) People just<br/>\naren&#39;t selling them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; option is a combine dagger or a crookstinger.

I<br/>\nwas just looking for the Dirk for the day when I blessedly get dual wield.<br/>\nAs it is now I&#39;ve got a Dwarven Axe sitting in the bank that I&#39;ll use since<br/>\nit&#39;s really fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a different subject and trying to keep it Bard related: What can a<br/>\nbard do (if anything) when he/she is being constantly robbed of his/her<br/>\nkills by magic users? For example.. I&#39;m sitting on the training hill in<br/>\nCrushbone just wailing away having a good ol&#39; time - nobody else is up there<br/>\n(that I can see) and I&#39;m just plugging away at Centurions.. Lo&#39; and behold<br/>\nthe Trainer spawns.. I start whacking away at him thinking great, real<br/>\nexperience now - and *zap* *bang* *boosh* and the trainer is running to a<br/>\nmagic user that was hiding himself over the edge of the hill. Aparently (now<br/>\nI know) the Trainer carries the Shiney Brass Shield sometimes.. I mutter my<br/>\nprofanities and the other person leaves (so I thought). Same thing happens<br/>\nagain.. And again.. I finally get sick of it and leave the hill. Is there<br/>\nnothing that as a Bard we can do to prevent this sort of thing? I mean, I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t camping for the shield (didnt even really know about it at first) but<br/>\nmy kills were being stolen. I&#39;ve camped before and gladly take turns with<br/>\nany other groups that are present - but it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s<br/>\nsuch rampant stealing like this and nothing that can be done about it. Whine<br/>\nto Verrant? I doubt they&#39;d do anything.. Duel the caster? Bah, he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\naccept. And neither of us were PvP&#39;s. Are we as Bard&#39;s just stuck to the<br/>\nwhims of Magic users?<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t even get into the massive and unbelievable amount of KS&#39;ing on the<br/>\nnew Brell Serillis server.. keeeeripes man. 100 people outside of Felwithe<br/>\ngoing after the same MOB&#39;s.. I gave up on that server quickly.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
