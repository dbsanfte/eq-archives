I don&#39;t think stacking <br/>\n&gt;works at all . . .<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 21 May 1999 06:58:12 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: David Rubino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tOK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion about<br/>\n&gt;&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>\n&gt;at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>\n&gt;special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>\n&gt;one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>\n&gt;quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>\n&gt;stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not impossible in the game..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tMy only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes, serious all right..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tDo people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>\n&gt;effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>\n&gt;pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>\n&gt;entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>\n&gt;icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>\n&gt;actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>\n&gt;when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>\n&gt;either song!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well 2 songs is one thing, but I used to stack 3 songs sometimes.<br/>\nWell, some bards do it, but I don&#39;t normally stack or twist Hymn of <br/>\nRestoration during combat. Usually I&#39;ll stack something that has an on-going <br/>\neffect like Whistling Warsong and Anthem (both of those effects are on-going <br/>\nas long as the icon is there). You get a pretty nice boost to stats while <br/>\nthey are both there. Try stacking them and check your stats. I also threw in <br/>\nthat song that lowers mob attack speed (i like that one)..I think it&#39;s level <br/>\n21 song? Don&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tI&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>\n&gt;very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>\n&gt;take seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tI for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Musil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, not everyone does it or wants to do it. Suit yourself, I&#39;m sure you <br/>\nmake a fine bard either way. I do take it seriously though (we&#39;re not very <br/>\ngood fighters, I like to have every bonus I can get).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t find it too much trouble either, as usually if i&#39;m not twisting I&#39;m <br/>\njust standing there in auto-combat mode waiting for the computer to resolve <br/>\nall the attack rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
