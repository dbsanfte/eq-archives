You<br/>\nmay need to buy a lot of stuff from them but they do have a pool of items<br/>\nthat they got from players.  If you keep buying from that pool, eventually<br/>\nyou can buy your item back. Might be a whole lot easier to get a lev 50<br/>\ndruid to help you get a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. has anyone seen Lord Grimlot recently? I have tried clearing the skelly<br/>\ncamp in SK in an effort to get him to spawn but no luck.  Does he only spwan<br/>\nif the quest is initiated?<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s.
