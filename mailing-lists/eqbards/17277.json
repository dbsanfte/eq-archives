We were fighting<br/>\nside by side in the Sol B King&#39;s room and I decided to give up one of my YKs<br/>\nto her so that she could work on her 1HS duel wield which she hasn&#39;t done in<br/>\n15 levels.  I&#39;d like to see the stats on a warrior with a Mithral 2-hander<br/>\n(her 2HS) vs. 2 YKs.  It was simply a sight to behold.  Not stop swinging,<br/>\nnon-stop proc&#39;ing.  She was cutting down Kobolds like a hot knife through<br/>\nbutter and the taunt factor was so darn high there was practically nothing<br/>\nanyone could do to get a MOBs attention.  The cleric loved that since it<br/>\nmeant really only one person to worry about healing :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe, looks like I&#39;m going back to my single YK and Kisch combo since I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever see that second YK back!  Never realized how much less<br/>\ndamage we REALLY do in battle as compared to a warrior until I saw with my<br/>\nown eyes the difference in her wielding 2 YKs vs. me wielding 2 YKs...<br/>\n<br/>\nKinda a bit disappointing also.  We went on a Kedge Keep raid last night and<br/>\nmy role became weaving Guardian, Rhythms and Berserkers or Guardian, Rhythms<br/>\nand Bubbles (fighting estrella after she dispelled everyones EB) with a drum<br/>\non the big mobs in the tank group.  They didn&#39;t even miss my relatively<br/>\ninsignificant damage and the heightened magic resist made a HUGE difference<br/>\nagainst the swirlspine who couldn&#39;t spin a darn one in my group.  This after<br/>\n3 dragon raids ( all failures so far :-( ) where I just stood under the<br/>\nbeast and weaved guardian and rhythms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s my point?  Sure seems like my days of pretending to be a warrior and<br/>\nswinging blades is quickly approaching the end as my role in the big fights<br/>\npretty much eliminates me from swinging a sword anyhow.  So, YK vs. Bladed<br/>\nThulian Claws really only applies if I&#39;m solo&#39;ing I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the bards role in the plains?  Resistance, Mana, Slow, Speed?  hehe,<br/>\nI really do like swinging my swords!<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 46th song (would be 47th if I didn&#39;t do those darn dragons!)<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
