Last night I was killing time waiting for a friend and picked GF up <br/>\non track again.  I decided I&#39;d try to kite him (level 36, MM drums, using <br/>\nFufil&#39;s because the range is sooooo much better than Bellow) and got a nasty <br/>\nsurprise.  Yes, I am faster than him.  No, I am not fast enough to kite him <br/>\n- even very shallow turns brought me into his range (which is a lot farther <br/>\nthan other griffs - more like a giant).  He hits *at least* as hard as HGs, <br/>\nand seems to double attack a lot more.  Well, I ended up in a crumpled blue <br/>\nheap on a hillside in NK, and learned a little humility. = )  I have rather <br/>\na lot of experience kiting (made most of my experience from 15 to 21 that <br/>\nway), and I must admit that this is something toward the top of my &quot;must do <br/>\nsomeday&quot; list - gotta prove to myself I can do it.  On the other hand, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot suicidal, and I&#39;ll wait until 40+ and maybe upgrade to Selo&#39;s Drum <br/>\nfirst... &lt;drool&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
