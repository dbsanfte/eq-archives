But I would point out that all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is true.  But unlike spells, which can be cast and forgotten about for<br/>\n&gt; long periods of time, Bard songs must be continuously sung to work<br/>\n&gt; effectively.  A song that could be sung and have a permanent effect would be<br/>\n&gt; contrarian to the way the class works.  Forgetting game balance and all other<br/>\n&gt; issues, a binding song just makes no sense in the world of Norrath.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heck, if we had 6 or 7 combat skills like the other 3 hybrids, I&#39;d agree that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bind would be completely inappropriate.  But really, it would be like saying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Clerics can&#39;t have bind because the Rangers would be pissed!  We&#39;re a breed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; apart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Indeed we are a breed apart.  As another poster has written we are &quot;no-class.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I would almost say that there are four types of player classes in EQ:<br/>\n&gt; casters, melee, hybrids, and bards.  True, we don&#39;t have the combat skills<br/>\n&gt; that the 3 hybrids do.  But we can do some pretty amazing things to<br/>\n&gt; compensate.  We don&#39;t use mana like the other hybrids (Dirge excepted).  We<br/>\n&gt; can reduce downtime like no other class in the game.  We can fill wildcard<br/>\n&gt; spots in just about any group: from crowd control to tanking.  To give us<br/>\n&gt; these combat skills would unbalance us wildly, and the next thing you know all<br/>\n&gt; the kewl d00dz would be playing bards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would love a binding song.  I would love better combat skills.  But I<br/>\n&gt; honestly think that beefing us up in either of these areas would cause other<br/>\n&gt; classes to call foul...and probably result in a suite of unwanted nerfs for<br/>\n&gt; the bard class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
