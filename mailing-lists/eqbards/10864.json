I used it in Highpass Keep, and for <br/>\nonce, our finger wiggling casters didn&#39;t get hit once!!  I just constantly <br/>\nplayed pixie strike (ignoring the &quot;Just play the mana song&quot;), while <br/>\nweaving in the mana song, and my group was AMAZED. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You mean, you sped up our attack, mana songed AND stopped the monster <br/>\nfrom aggroing on the finger wigglers? WOW! Do you cook too?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was I to do ?  I handed out Gnome and Troll shaped cookies with <br/>\nbottles of Kalish (no milk in highpass keep).<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to get chosen for groups pretty quick now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral(s) of the Story : <br/>\n   1) Advertise, Advertise, Advertise<br/>\n   Let people KNOW what tricks you are doing. They don&#39;t know<br/>\n   what &#39;Eyes glaze over&#39; and &#39;Surrounded by Chains of Music&#39;<br/>\n   mean. Communicate. You will find other people in your group<br/>\n   will start to do the same.<br/>\n\t <br/>\n   2) ALWAYS take an opportunity to chat with fellow bards. Make<br/>\n   friends. As a class, we of all people need to talk shop<br/>\n   a LOT. We have a TON of neat songs, but without the knowledge<br/>\n   they are like that sewing machine in the other room. Ie. a <br/>\n   great tool, but worthless because lack of skill and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n   3) Take a night off occasionally to help lower leveled friends.<br/>\n   They might be your groupmates some day if they suddenly gain<br/>\n   a bunch of levels :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrashii (Vanitii?), Bard in the 32nd Key<br/>\nSeekers of Lore Officer, Tarew Marr  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loreseekers.com\">http://www.loreseekers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Wow did I get lucky. I found a Rune that a level 50 finger wigger<br/>\n needed on a deepwater croc, and asked him if he would help my friend <br/>\n (who I was there on a mission with me in Oasis) get the last spoke he <br/>\n  needed from the deepwater goblin spire.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, the mob agrod on him, and I went and tanked it until he could <br/>\n  cast on it.    We had to zone (had 3 more there too), but when we came <br/>\n  back, the one we killed HAD THE OPALINE HELM!<br/>\n<br/>\n  At the time, I had NO idea what the helm was for I just thought, <br/>\n  &quot;Look its black! I look soooo good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sure glad I looted it =D<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS. Could have looted a Gypsie Lute Last night <br/>\n     had I been in Mistmoor... =(<br/>\n<br/>\nPPPS. I Sure would like some different clothes to wear to weddings <br/>\n      and such. I&#39;ve been the maid of honor at 2 weddings (3 on Saturday), <br/>\n      and I&#39;ve attended them in either my all bronze (level 18 or so), or <br/>\n      my current getup of &#39;TV Antenna&#39; (quick raise your right arm, <br/>\n      channel 7 isnt coming in!) (all silvery). <br/>\n       A Nice white dress would be nice :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Douglass Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Sylly Charms<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you sure Sylly didnt sing Chrissons Pixie strike its a mez song, and<br/>\nit would make more sense that it wiped aggressor list.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaezebel Moonsong-Yeuxune<br/>\nGypsy Bard of the 32nd song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n========<br/>\nOperaman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt; said :<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Broon was running amuck last night and scaring innocents throughout E K.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I, a 21st Song Hero, bravely ran up, got his attention, and proceeded with<br/>\nmy plan...
