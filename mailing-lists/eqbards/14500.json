At one time they had conquered a large part of Norrath.  The <br/>\nother gods got angry and banish RZ for his meddling, the giants were <br/>\nscattered, the orges were cursed to thier present form as were the goblin <br/>\nclans.<br/>\n<br/>\nlink to online version of the History of Norrath:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpt from the history:<br/>\nSeveral of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of <br/>\ntheir developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who <br/>\nquickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their empire <br/>\ngrew outward from their mountain home until it eventually encompassed a <br/>\nlarge portion of Tunaria(now known as Antonica), largest of the known <br/>\ncontinents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they <br/>\nbecame weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and <br/>\ndimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride <br/>\nas his creations challenged the gods of that realm, and when they eventually <br/>\nknew defeat, the Warlord himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued <br/>\nshook the heavens and angered the greater gods. Through their combined <br/>\nmight, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to his domain, after <br/>\nwhich a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected, denying entry to <br/>\nboth the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some view as <br/>\nspite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord&#39;s creations. Thousands <br/>\nof Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were <br/>\nspread from one end of the earth to the other, forced to flee their homes as <br/>\nthe gods brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. And the <br/>\ngoblins were also cursed, but no writings remain of their punishment as they <br/>\nno longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as <br/>\nto the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Norrathian Lore: Nagafen&#39;s Lair<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 4 Feb 2000 16:00:06 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I assumed the big dog was nagafen too, buy maybe it is the leader of the<br/>\n&gt;kobolds - kind of like the way Egyptian art depicts their kings as<br/>\n&gt;physically larger than the rest of the rabble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Technically Nagafen is a wyrm, a dragon is closer to a reptilian creature<br/>\n&gt;than it is to a mammal like dogs or kobolds.

Maybe goblins, what<br/>\n&gt;the heck are they related to or derived from within the lore of Norrath?<br/>\n&gt;Fire Giants?

As far as I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.
