I play a ranger as much as I play my<br/>\nbard (both are level 35ish) (bard lost 35 in a fun lil naggy run) As a<br/>\ngroups snare person it&#39;s _critical_ that you keep npc&#39;s from running.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot just an option.  It&#39;s mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m in a group and I&#39;m not pulling my weight snaring then something is<br/>\nseriously wrong.  If the person doing the snaring isn&#39;t pulling their weight<br/>\nthen they get disbanded.  I hold myself to this standard as well.  If one<br/>\nruns because someone rooted/Ebonied/whatevered then it&#39;s not as much of a<br/>\n&#39;blame&#39; but there&#39;s still some blame there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I will tell a group &quot;it&#39;s not my fault if it runs&quot; is if there<br/>\nis a magician with an earth pet.  as I said before 90% of the groups I&#39;m in<br/>\nI won&#39;t allow the magician to use that pet.  They get _four_.  There&#39;s no<br/>\nreason for them to use one that roots as it&#39;s power.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate.  Harmonic is correct.  If someone&#39;s job in the group is to keep<br/>\nthings snared then they darn well better do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ryan Honeyman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 20, 2000 4:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Chains Reliability<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You would bet wrong. I&#39;ve had snares wear off on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ll be blunt.  Snares duration is all or nothing.  Snare doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   wear off.  I see you fall into the lazy druid category now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Snare when the mob is at 1/3 of it&#39;s life, you&#39;ll have best results.<br/>\n&gt;   If you are the primary healer, your snare job doesn&#39;t change.<br/>\n&gt;   You heal, and then you snare.  There are places where snaring is<br/>\n&gt;   critical, Permafrost and SolA come to mind.  If you got resisted<br/>\n&gt;   on Snare, then chances are the monster will not be running from<br/>\n&gt;   you as it&#39;s 6ish levels higher than you are.  Fight non-red mobs,<br/>\n&gt;   or find a party who is closer to your level.  Snare works perfectly<br/>\n&gt;   then.  I think it&#39;s not so much that the spell is busted, but rather<br/>\n&gt;   the player.  Gotta hate user error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
