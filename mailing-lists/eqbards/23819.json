At the time, I was on as my higher level <br/>\ndruid, and I let a young bard loot it instead. I did some research <br/>\nafterwards and found that it&#39;s used in a shadowknight quest for Darkforge <br/>\narmor, but I was wondering if it actually has any effects when used as an <br/>\ninstrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving never seen one of these before, I did a bit of research and found <br/>\nthat it adds +10 to poison resists, but no word if it actually affects wind <br/>\nsongs by any significant increase. Anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonnett<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
