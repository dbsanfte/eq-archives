I<br/>\nwent because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>\nhim.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>\nthen proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>\nnow have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>\nsomewhere in the maze.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to know is...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>\nto the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>\nby.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>\nspell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\nMithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
