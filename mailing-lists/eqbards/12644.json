I brought up my halfing druid<br/>\nhere and totally forgot about this place for other classes. No kidding about<br/>\nthe guards though. Keep your kills away from them. There&#39;s so much to hunt<br/>\nin Misty that once the guards go off and chase down 1 creature, they aggro<br/>\non another, and another, and another and are soon pretty far away from their<br/>\nposts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround level 10 you can start taking out Mooto, gobbo who runs around<br/>\nbuffing the other goblins in the zone. The orc camp in the corner is good<br/>\ntoo once you get high enough. Turn in Orc belts to Deputy Budo (in a tower<br/>\nin the wall) and the warbeads to the sheriff in Rivervale to help your<br/>\nfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can sometimes sell to the merchants through the windows of their<br/>\nbuildings to save yourself from some of that crouching. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tieben, David P [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TiebeDP@...\">TiebeDP@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 06, 2000 8:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Digest Number 635<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I was in my single digit levels I found Misty Thicket to <br/>\n&gt; be a great<br/>\n&gt; place as a Bard.  There are lots of goblins to kill and you <br/>\n&gt; can easily solo<br/>\n&gt; several camps with Selos.  Remember to  keep turning in the Runnyeye<br/>\n&gt; Warbeads even if they don&#39;t give you xps right away.  Eventually after<br/>\n&gt; killing enough goblins the halflings will warm up to you and <br/>\n&gt; start giving<br/>\n&gt; you xps for the beads.  The only downsides are you have to get through<br/>\n&gt; Kithicor Forest, The halfling guards as spastic about <br/>\n&gt; stealing your kills<br/>\n&gt; and all that crouching makes your back ache.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found Misty Thicket to be a great beginning area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rylos of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; Level 18 Bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling <br/>\n&gt; &gt; areas for a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; semi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as <br/>\n&gt; &gt; intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Klayan Deathbringer (The Oracle) lvl 50 Necro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Celantra (The Oracle) lvl 8 semi-twink Bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
