Also, if they said <br/>\n&gt; before they<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t add it because of memory limitations, are they going <br/>\n&gt; to have to<br/>\n&gt; delete some things to add in the Iskar textures? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Though the system requirements will be increased for the expansion, EQ<br/>\n&gt; proper must continue to work for the originally published <br/>\n&gt; specifcations. As<br/>\n&gt; such, we&#39;ll have to see how much texture memory we have left <br/>\n&gt; after adding<br/>\n&gt; the Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much <br/>\n&gt; individuality can<br/>\n&gt; be added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must <br/>\n&gt; exist in all<br/>\n&gt; zones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common <br/>\n&gt; denominator of the<br/>\n&gt; old EQ system requirements. <br/>\n&gt; Now, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will <br/>\n&gt; have more varied<br/>\n&gt; and complex textures than you see in the world now. This is <br/>\n&gt; possible because<br/>\n&gt; those items can only be viewed by people who bought the <br/>\n&gt; expansion thereby<br/>\n&gt; agreeing to the new system requirements. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Gordon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
