Pet will get lost because it&#39;s so far away from him.  <br/>\n&gt; Kill him when<br/>\n&gt; you get back, he can&#39;t make a new pet so he&#39;s even more <br/>\n&gt; helpless than a<br/>\n&gt; wizzie.

I lost, but I learned something.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1)  You can&#39;t charm the pet.  2)  You can&#39;t charm people you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouped with.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There was a bug where I tried charming the pet and it didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But once he killed me, his pet went berserk and attacked him... he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost died.  I say, get him back for your guild mates.  Charm HIM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into attacking his pet.  Let his pet kill him and he will lose exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ;)  He will love that!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 43rd Bard of the Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, Bill Costlow &lt;atlatyl@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days now about how great he is.
