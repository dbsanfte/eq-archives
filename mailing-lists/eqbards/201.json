Actually, they<br/>\n&gt;were on my corpse, way up in Everfrost Peaks, but having died in Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;Hills, I lost it.<br/>\n&gt;Taking this as a sign from the Gods, I decided to practice Hand-to-Hand<br/>\n&gt;attacking until I could generate more coin. Decided to truly live the life<br/>\n&gt;of an ascetic, I choose to fast. I hoped that I could &quot;live on a song&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;have Jaxon&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor restore any stamina a lost due to starvation.<br/>\n&gt;This plan might have worked, but I zoned and the song ended and I forget to<br/>\n&gt;re-sing it. I cast it as I passed out and watched my stamina and health<br/>\n&gt;bars creep up and down near their midpoints. Eventually, I began to bleed<br/>\n&gt;to death. I don&#39;t know why, I guess starvation will do that to you. The<br/>\n&gt;Coup de Grace (sp?) was right before I died. I received a rather odd<br/>\n&gt;message. I left it at home, but the gist was:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\n&gt;Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\n&gt;you died<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Whoah! Who are these Pain and Suffering beasties? They apparently live in<br/>\n&gt;the city of Qeynos, since that&#39;s where I was at the time.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve since decided that I should probably eat. As of this posting, Plastos<br/>\n&gt;is camped out under the Dock of Qeynos, wishing he had more food and some<br/>\n&gt;clothing. Tonight, the long climb back begins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Journeyman Plastos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
