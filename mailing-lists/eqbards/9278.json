After we killed one,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1929651853\">Lament:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhile pulling dervs from a full camp (long ago) i was able to lament 2<br/>\nof the 3 dervs, pull the third, and have the party kill it. After we<br/>\nkilled one, we figured we could handle the other 2, so the SK in the<br/>\nparty hit one with a spell, the other derv ignored it and stayed put. I<br/>\nrepeated this test several times with different mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis shows two things; one: when a creature is lamented, he is lamented<br/>\nfor all, not just the bard. two: Lament lasts longer than 10 seconds, at<br/>\nleast as long as the time it takes a party of level 10-12s to kill a<br/>\nderv and heal/med up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOverall, I have found Lament VERY usefull. It fails VERY rarely (one in<br/>\n30 or so, maybe even less) and costs no mana :) leaving the casters who<br/>\nCAN lull FOM.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have used Lament recently, to solo a 2 aviak guard tower, great xp,<br/>\ngood loot, little downtime. Usually by the time i am ready to fight, the<br/>\navaik is waiting for me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAND, if lament fails, you can always selo away. Once while lamenting<br/>\nthe derv camp with 5 dervs in it, it failed on the first shot. I ran off<br/>\nto the zone, and my party was able to pick off each derv as they walked<br/>\nback. I got xp for 4 out of the 5, and to top it off, they thought i<br/>\nMEANT to do it :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
