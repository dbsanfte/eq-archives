That is part of playing on Test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um. You&#39;ll notice from my previous post that I understood the necessity to<br/>\nwipe the player base, but not the manner in which they conducted it; ie,<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t forewarn anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll things considered, it wasn&#39;t the smartest thing to do.  Now they&#39;ve got<br/>\na few hundred &#39;newbies&#39; running around.  How are they going to continue<br/>\ntesting high level spells, songs, skills and zones?  Wait for a few months<br/>\nuntil people are of a sufficient level?  More likely, the GMs will do what<br/>\nthey did before and buff a select few to the level they require and they&#39;ll<br/>\nbe back to square one again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can guarantee that the majority of people who get buffed to 50 or 60,<br/>\ndumped in a zone and told to test it will not do so objectively.  The only<br/>\npeople who should test such places and situations are those who have<br/>\nactually attained that level, either in test or live, in a progressive<br/>\nmanner such that they understand how a character should be played at that<br/>\nlevel.  You can&#39;t dump a buffed newbie (or even a buffed 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s<br/>\ncharacter) into a situation that requires level 50 knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIRL, I&#39;m a Quality Assurance Analyst.  I need to know every nook and crannie<br/>\nof our product in order to effectively test updates, enhancements, nerfs<br/>\n(they do happen ;) and changes.  The same goes with EverQuest.  Sure, any<br/>\nTom, Dick or Harry can find geometry errors, typos, broken quests etc, but<br/>\nyou need someone that knows their class abilities inside out to effectively<br/>\ntest the complexitites of their spells/songs and skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople treated Test like a live server and played there because the<br/>\npopulation is substantially less than on the others.  But even so, it would<br/>\nhave been a simple courtesy to warn players a few days to a week before of<br/>\ntheir intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when was the last time they did a complete player wipe?  Certainly not<br/>\nrecently, because Lyrnia&#39;s bard was level 50.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
