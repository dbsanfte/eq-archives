Out<br/>\nof nowhere, the mob (forget what it was) cast a spell on me then continued<br/>\nto fight the other party.  My group or I had did nothing to draw the mob.<br/>\nWas this Bard Hate too?  NO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, mobs have some randomness in who they attack.  Every<br/>\nclass will experience this.  I don&#39;t think Bards are more heavily weighted<br/>\nthan all other class.  Unfortunately Bards also draw mobs with their songs<br/>\nthat pulse every 6 seconds.  So they get both the random mobs and the<br/>\nsong-drawn mobs.  This is why it seems so much worse for Bards than any<br/>\nother characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
