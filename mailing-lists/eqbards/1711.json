The aqua<br/>\ngoblins have claimed a structure in the bottom of the lake, similar to<br/>\ntowers with the ladders in places like Misty.  Easiest way to find it is go<br/>\nto the fisherman and their shacks (the fellows with halberds), dive in from<br/>\nthere and head straight out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of the shipwreck, and plan to visit that, thanks for the<br/>\ndirections!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another place worth investigating is the shipwreck off Wisp<br/>\n&gt;Isle in Erudin&#39;s Crossing.

I stopped<br/>\n&gt;because I lost sight of him but he went a bit further and<br/>\n&gt;swears he saw a fish or mermaid down there.
