The Butler is very good about<br/>\n&gt;remembering to unload his HT on you, fortunately he does it in the<br/>\n&gt;opening and not when you are low on hp. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;P.S. Remember that what a druid can solo and what a bard can solo easily<br/>\n&gt;are two different things. The bane of the bard class is any casting<br/>\n&gt;monster, while we can shred most lower level meleers quite easily.<br/>\n&gt;Casting classes love to burn down casters. Also ask the druid how many<br/>\n&gt;huge trains he&#39;s pulled to the zone after messing up a pull on the<br/>\n&gt;Butler, or how many times he moved to the wrong spot and had both cooks<br/>\n&gt;aggro on him (assumes he is KOS in MM). Most will say none, but in fact<br/>\n&gt;the super huge trains at the zone in MM are usually as a result of one<br/>\n&gt;higher level player putting everyone in jeopardy instead of just dying<br/>\n&gt;quietly and peacefully. I am *not* saying your druid friend does this,<br/>\n&gt;but maybe he does. Also, the point about the con in wolfform is<br/>\n&gt;important. Let&#39;s see him try fighting the &quot;easy&quot; butler in place without<br/>\n&gt;Wolfform *laugh*.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Insert comment from said Druid:]<br/>\nI was in wolf form.  I was not KOS in wolf form.  I did in fact harmony the<br/>\nmobs there.  However I forgot 1 gargoyle and died.  I did have the good grace<br/>\nto die and not spirit of cheetah to the zone killing countless lower levels.  I<br/>\ndid return and kill the Butler solo very easily (with correct application of<br/>\nharmony this time).  In fact I buffed up, damage shielded, harmonied, DoT&#39;d the<br/>\nbutler and just greater healed myself as needed *melee*ing him to death.<br/>\n[end non-farming/non-KSing/non-ebayselling/non-training Druid comment :)]<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are all pretty valid points, and in fact, last time i was in Mistmoore a<br/>\nlvl 50 Druid brought the entire castle down on my poor 23rd level head.(OUCH!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, in the case of this Druid, he is someone that i work with, so i know his<br/>\ntactics etc.  He has made errors in the castle twice.  the errors were: 1. <br/>\ntried to solo the Cloaked Damphyr at too low a level.  He tried to gate and<br/>\ndied.  2.  Tried to solo Lasna Cheroon (sp?) and missed a harmony somewhere. <br/>\nHe got the gate off and lived (i was on the phone with him at the time)  <br/>\nAs i think i stated before, he is not KOS in Mistmoore (in wolf form), he has<br/>\nnever killed anything but named mobs, which do not hit you with the faction<br/>\nadjustment.  He also is more one of those &quot;fight it out while mashing the gate<br/>\nbutton&quot; types than the &quot;run to zone and pick up human sheilds&quot; types.  Alot of<br/>\ndruids i have seen are the latter, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Insert annoying Druid type comment again:]<br/>\nYes I try to gate out rather than train and kill folks...would rather die<br/>\nmyself than get others killed. :)  Actually most of the named mobs there do<br/>\nhave a faction hit but if you just run through in wolf checking which nameds<br/>\nare up you can kill them on and off over 15 or so levels without lowering your<br/>\nfaction a whole lot. :)<br/>\nWell actually you *can* camp npc Bards to raise your MM faction...of course I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done this...yet. :)<br/>\n[end annoying insert]<br/>\n<br/>\nheh...he just walked over to my cube and was reading over my shoulder....<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not want to imply that a lvl 32 Bard could solo the butler if that is<br/>\nwhat i did.  Obviously, we are just not equipped to even GET there, let alone<br/>\nsolo a named mob (caster, no less) that is only 2 lvls below us.  But, you<br/>\ncould probably bribe a druid to get it for you. : )<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd song<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nMighty Defender of Druids that don&#39;t train people :-)<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
