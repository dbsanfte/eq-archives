But if you do group, you may need to endure some bad groups. After 31,<br/>\nI predict you will be a lot more intent on not dieing - at least I was (am).<br/>\nCT has some hard spots where you - or anyone -- simply will not survive for<br/>\nvery long unless you have a well balanced group:  this MEANS you HAVE to<br/>\nhave a HEALER.  And a real one.  A ranger and a bard don&#39;t make even a half<br/>\nhealer. Maybe a druid and a sha together make a healer.  You were doomed<br/>\nfrom the get go. But his gating away was nasty too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have been thinking is what bards really need is Feign Death.  We do<br/>\nso much of the real thing - we ought to be pretty good at faking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I have been thinking of trying is the potion that you can<br/>\nbuy that casts shadow step.   Yes, we got Melifioius motion but maybe the<br/>\nwhole party does not want to be teleported when u do.  And maybe you don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel like seeing the bottom of lake Rathe (although sometimes even there<br/>\nwould be preferable to where you are.)  But anyhow - for inside places we<br/>\nreally do not have any sort of &quot;get out of dieing free&quot; card like gate,<br/>\nfeign, shadow step, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nScreech gets resisted - even with brass. Speaking of which, I think that I<br/>\nhave really neglected that skill.  I don&#39;t use it much so I bet it has not<br/>\nkept up.  My denons is resisted a lot more than chords it seems and screech<br/>\nhas been resisted a bunch recently too.  I think its time to have a Shady<br/>\nlittle concert again.  The skill says master but any skill with points over<br/>\n100 is considered mastered.  But if not used it may not be mastered as far<br/>\nas it possible? <br/>\n<br/>\nSIDEBAR:  How many zones is it from Halas to the Exe room in old guk?<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I was looking at last night. (Remind me to re-bind tonight!!)<br/>\nAnother benefit of groups over 30.  Clerics (the one who is in your group<br/>\nbecause now you don&#39;t group unless there is one) can rez* u back so binding<br/>\nbecomes less of an issue.  Corpse finding and dragging do come into play.<br/>\nYou will be consenting to get your corpse dragged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this boils down to how to get better groups.  One way is join a good<br/>\nguild.  In a good guild - it might have a lot of players your level so its<br/>\neasy to find groups  - or find groups that they are in.  Typically, it&#39;s not<br/>\nan all guild group but if you got a lot of guildies, its easier to find a<br/>\ngroup that needs some one.  /guildsay   &quot;Hey, I see u r in Highkeep - any<br/>\nroom for me?&quot;  &quot;Ya, I will save a spot for you - hurry!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you will meet other guilds and there are guild alliances.  You will<br/>\nfeel a lot better consenting a guildie to drag you than some one u never met<br/>\nbefore and never saw his name before.  And you are prolly wearing your guild<br/>\nbuddy&#39;s steel greaves or borrowing his Crys Blade so he&#39;s got some vested<br/>\ninterest in helping you get your corpse back. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*\trez = resurrect or revive you - they need to be able to target your<br/>\ncorpse then cast rez on it and it zones you back - with a debilitating<br/>\neffect that takes a few minutes to wear off - and no mana - which don&#39;t<br/>\nmatter that much to a bard but to other casters it does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, November 05, 1999 10:47 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Oh, I&#39;m just so mad.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell it was bound to happen sooner or later - I finally met<br/>\nan EQ player<br/>\n\t\tA Ranger, Rogue, Enchanter and a bard.
