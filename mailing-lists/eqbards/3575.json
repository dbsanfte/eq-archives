So I am wondering if <br/>\n     bronze plate might have the same advantage.  Bronze is only slightly <br/>\n     better then banded ac wise (1 or 2 ac better depending on the piece) <br/>\n     but weights almost twice as much.  Not a very good trade off <br/>\n     considering the weight problem that most of us have.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     So, in a nutshell, is Bronze plate worth the extra weight?  Does plate <br/>\n     have an advantage over banded other then the AC increase?<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Thanks for you help!<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold  17th square<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n     <br/>\n     --------------------------------------------<br/>\n     &quot;Some mornings it just doesn&#39;t seem worth it to gnaw through the <br/>\n     leather straps.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
