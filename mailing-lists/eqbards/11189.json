As we were getting ready to<br/>\n&gt; assault the room, a wanderer walked up behind us.  Immediately we were<br/>\n&gt; swarmed by 4 frogs we had invis&#39;d our way passed.  I thought <br/>\n&gt; the druid was<br/>\n&gt; going to evac, and since I didn&#39;t have screech mem&#39;d (getting <br/>\n&gt; sooo hard to<br/>\n&gt; decide what to keep on tap), I started striking the mobs that <br/>\n&gt; were hitting<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The necro&#39;s pet probably got one of them close to dead before <br/>\n&gt; dying itself<br/>\n&gt; fairly early on in the fight.  The two casters focussed on <br/>\n&gt; starfiring and<br/>\n&gt; draining one frog at a time, while I struck those yet <br/>\n&gt; untouched.  All the<br/>\n&gt; frogs were red, and I was able to keep two down with very <br/>\n&gt; little damage<br/>\n&gt; being taken.  When one frog remained standing, I kept it <br/>\n&gt; glazed over till<br/>\n&gt; the duo had enough mana to finish it off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love being a bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Athren </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
