If Verant had stuck to their<br/>\n&gt;original 1500 max per server (and dispite their denials I remember them<br/>\n&gt;stating this in beta. They shut down all the servers but one one day and<br/>\n&gt;asked us all to log in specifically to test if the server could take<br/>\n&gt;that many) then you wouldn&#39;t have these problems. They now seem to be<br/>\n&gt;relying on people sticking it out until the expansion when they can hope<br/>\n&gt;that the current server populations will be more comfortable with the<br/>\n&gt;addition of the extra zones but personally I think their reluctance to<br/>\n&gt;put new servers online in a timely manner will hurt them in the long<br/>\n&gt;run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
