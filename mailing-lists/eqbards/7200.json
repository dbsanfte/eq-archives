I&#39;ve been nice to<br/>\nhim, ah, he&#39;s charmed.  Hmm, ranger is also wacking<br/>\nme.  This isn&#39;t good.  So I start charming back.  It<br/>\nseemed to work, I wasn&#39;t getting wacked any more. <br/>\nThis was moments before our entire sever crashed for 3<br/>\nhours.  I&#39;m sure it was my fault :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Rokenn Swiftsong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night in Sol B I attempted to charm a GK shamen<br/>\n&gt; pet and got a new <br/>\n&gt; message: This NPC can not pet charmed.  It would<br/>\n&gt; seem that NPC pet&#39;s are no <br/>\n&gt; longer charmable.  I would have no problem with this<br/>\n&gt; if the NPC Pet died <br/>\n&gt; when the owner did.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know in the past people have used the charm song<br/>\n&gt; to break PC&#39;s out of NPC <br/>\n&gt; charm.
