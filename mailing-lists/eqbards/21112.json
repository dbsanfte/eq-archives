The answer, dear folks, is Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So I got bored while waiting on some friends to come over, right?  So I<br/>\nfired up EQ (I had camped out in my usualy dog-hunting spot next to the FV<br/>\ngiant camp), and decided to try a different twist to my kiting.  Instead of<br/>\nusing Chains/Chant/Chant, why not use Selo&#39;s/Chant/Chant?  (The Chants being<br/>\nFufil&#39;s and Tuyen&#39;s DoTs)  Before long, I had amassed a most impressive<br/>\ntally of 10 growlers, 1 snarler, and one froglock ton night who came outta<br/>\nnowhere, and had not lost even a bubble of hps!<br/>\n     Emboldened by this turn of events, later in the evening (my friends had<br/>\ncome by, and I had spent the afternoon chasing women with them) I was heard<br/>\nto wonder on guild chat &quot;hmmm...  I wonder if I can kite all 3 giants at<br/>\nonce?&quot;<br/>\n    Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.  What I found most amusing<br/>\nis that folks passing by would stop to watch in amazement.  There I was, a<br/>\nlone blue-clad, green-boot-wearin&#39; bard running in big circles with 2 giants<br/>\nand an ever-increasing horde of drolvargs (mostly growlers) not far behind.<br/>\nEvery now and then, one of the critters would fall over dead.  Thinking back<br/>\non it, I have to wonder how many times I was /petitioned for exploiting<br/>\nsomething   heh!<br/>\n     Mebbe one of these days I&#39;ll get the hang of Charm-kiting, but until<br/>\nthen... let the Druids and Necros stand in awe of the Kite-ability of the<br/>\nBardic class ;o)<br/>\n(I even got the druid to say &quot;Bards ROCK!!&quot; on guildchat after he saw me<br/>\nwittle down the long line of beasties)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nNOR Bard Talespinner, Esq.<br/>\nBard of 41 Seasons<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\nps:  cannae wait til I get Chant of Frost :o)~<br/>\n*begins looking for dragons*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
