Also if the Dervs are spawning nicely - you and some<br/>\n&gt; friends can keep them at bay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; East Karana - there is a terrible snake problem near the N Ro <br/>\n&gt; tunnel.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; your duty to do something about it!  Wear some stuff that is <br/>\n&gt; anti-poison!<br/>\n&gt; Keep Purifying Rythmns playing.  Asp&#39;s are nasty beasties!  By 14, you<br/>\n&gt; should be able to solo them - having a friend with cure <br/>\n&gt; poison really helps.<br/>\n&gt; Also you can hope for the occasional air-elemental and wisp to go by.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
