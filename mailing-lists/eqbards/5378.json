At night kill Dry Bones for small bronze plate and FS<br/>\nweapons. I am palking about at your level too, this is stuff I did at 24-28.<br/>\nThere are ghouls in NK halfway between the stone and wood bridges that<br/>\nconsistently drop Bronze weapons, usually good for another 15-20pp. Bandits<br/>\non the river in SK drop the same. If your over 30th, Spectres in Feerot drop<br/>\nScythes worth from 4pp for Bronze to 13pp for regular, Opals, Bpearls, Boxes<br/>\nof Abu Kar. These are just a couple of easy money makers. The thing is<br/>\nmaking money is like working for a living, you have to approach it like a<br/>\njob and make the effort if thats what you really want. After level 30 the<br/>\ncash just happens with the mobs dropping 1-3pp each and FS weapons to sell.<br/>\nYou can always find a mob that drops a good item and farm it though.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 7:38 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] EQ plat was: Elf Hide gloves : was trading the<br/>\nstei n comments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>\nloot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>\nnever had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent<br/>\ntime<br/>\nin unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>\n*that* great.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading<br/>\nabout<br/>\nhow others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAggrevated,<br/>\n<br/>\nYoyodyne on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Kuenster (Entex) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 9:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] EQ plat was: Elf Hide gloves : was trading the stei n<br/>\ncomments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even after level 20. I<br/>\n&gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and almost always over<br/>\n&gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will have up to 1000<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats a pain is<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. This is why I<br/>\n&gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for awesome items I or<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
