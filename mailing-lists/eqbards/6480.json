I know you all are probably getting<br/>\n&gt; petitions on alot of these so hopefully this information will allow you to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; inform players that it was a change and not a bug.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If there are any others we may have missed please report them to your<br/>\n&gt; server <br/>\n&gt; GM so that we can verify that they were indeed<br/>\n&gt; intentional changes and not bugs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Solist<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Normal arrows (item 8005)have had their range reduced from 50 to 25. This<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; because fletched arrows are range 50 and a<br/>\n&gt; flectcher making his own arrows should have better arrows than generic <br/>\n&gt; storebought ones. No other arrows were affected<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -The Box of Abu-Kar has had the it&#39;s weight reduction greatly reduced. <br/>\n&gt; (don&#39;t have exact reduction specs)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -The item Glowing Stein has been changed to Stein of Moggok<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -The Lustrous Russet Armor is now warrior only, a previous error had<br/>\n&gt; caused <br/>\n&gt; it to be used by several other classes despite the<br/>\n&gt; fact it was always intented to be warrior only<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -The Fletching kit now has 8 slots. This is to allow more items added into<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the process to make new bows.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -New tailoring items have been added. Tailors can now make the silk series<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; of armor. The books on how to manufacture these<br/>\n&gt; are also in the game, but are spawn drops and not vendor sales.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Vendors who previously sold just arrow nocks now sell all of the<br/>\n&gt; fletching <br/>\n&gt; materials.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reported by a Player (Remf the Troll)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -nobles crests from the npc paladins in swamp are nodrop now<br/>\n&gt; -kolandi fish now nodrop<br/>\n&gt; -erud tonic now nodrop<br/>\n&gt; -honeyjum now require high faction to acquire<br/>\n&gt; -egg shaped pumice now casts dispel magic instead of pillage enchantment<br/>\n&gt; -monster frenzy AI tweaked<br/>\n&gt; -crafted armor now sells to vendor for 10x lower prices<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -fishies still swim in the air<br/>\n&gt; -items dropped on ground become permanent fixtures, at least client side<br/>\n&gt; -teleporting monsters play leapfrog when the appear, keep jumping on top<br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; -new arrow range overrides bow rating (25 arrow + 150 bow = 25 arrow range<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; :/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Master Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\n&gt; WIN $100 to Amazon.com!
