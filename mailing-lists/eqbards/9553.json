Kithicor <br/>\ncan be dangerous if you wander around at lvl 5, or even lvl 10.  However, I <br/>\nwas a lvl 19 bard when in happened (just turned 20 last night!) and I died a <br/>\nwhopping 4 times in 4 hours just trying to get my corpse the heck OUT of <br/>\nKithicor.  It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know the way, but I was getting firebombed <br/>\nby blood red zombies with HUGE aggro radiuses.  Yippee, it&#39;s a wonderful <br/>\nevent...  yeah, right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had passed through Beholder&#39;s Maze just because I heard the war was going <br/>\nto happen in Highpass.  Since I knew that Verant never seems to have any <br/>\nkind of event that&#39;s not designed for levels 30+, I knew it was something I <br/>\nshould probably avoid.  (BTW, kudos to Verant for the Qeynos hills invasion; <br/>\nhad something for everybody for once).  So I run out of Rivervale right <br/>\nsmack into the middle of it.  Of course I was thinking that I had just <br/>\npassed the event (Highpass), I hadn&#39;t bothered to get bound.  So I&#39;m back in <br/>\nArena.  Travel all the way to Rivervale without a drum (no banks anywhere, <br/>\nand even if I HAD any money, no place sells drums...).  Then I spent the <br/>\nnext hour just trying to get INTO Kithicor.  Finally made it (after getting <br/>\nscared to death that my character had been deleted; rebooted and it was back <br/>\n&lt;whew&gt;) only to be blinded and eventually killed by Hate (which was <br/>\nacceptible, since I didn&#39;t lose any exp that time).<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, maybe I&#39;m just stupid, but don&#39;t you think that even if you&#39;re blind you <br/>\ncan still tell if you&#39;re dying and hear everything that&#39;s going on around <br/>\nyou?????<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so then I spend the next 2 hours just trying to get my corpse (again) <br/>\nout of Kithicor.  Now, if this had been held in Highpass as was rumored, at <br/>\nleast you can go around it.  Someone please tell me how you&#39;re supposed to <br/>\ntravel East without passing through Kithicor?  Well, short of &quot;beg some <br/>\nhigh-level wizard to teleport you, that&#39;s not always an option, unless <br/>\nVerant decides to set up Wizardly Travel Agency NPC&#39;s in each zone...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of the 20th Song<br/>\nE&#39;Ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
