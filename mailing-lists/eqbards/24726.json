I SUCK at charming,<br/>\nfind it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>\nmana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>\nreliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>\nI&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>\nnivs and try to mitigate damage.

Just one more finger stretching operation. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105 <br/>\n&gt; CHA and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez?
