It has been<br/>\nedited for both format and content. I recommend reading the buffing section<br/>\nfrom the first guide as well as the info on mobs. The full version can be<br/>\nfound at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.anthonybackman.com/war/eq/\">http://www.anthonybackman.com/war/eq/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the 49th level<br/>\nTribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nBREAK IN STRATAGY<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the numbers we can get more specific on strategy. Aegis Terra<br/>\non Tarew Marr (thanks to Thumpa and Saerli) was able to break the patrol<br/>\nwith around 16 folks so weather or not it&#39;s possible is really a moot point,<br/>\nit&#39;s just how fast you can move from there. If you have numbers in the 50&#39;s<br/>\nyou could make short work of it as long as most of the casters split into 2<br/>\nor 3 groups and alternate the burn cycle. <br/>\nFeign Death (FD) pullers will be a factor, Enchanters will be a factor,<br/>\nClerics will be a factor, all are encouraged to come. <br/>\n<br/>\nWest wall camp is too dangerous. It may be a possibility if we have 4+<br/>\nenchanters and a good working grasp of the assist key. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe default plan is a north wall camp. This plan calls for a very seasoned<br/>\ncrew of Fear terrain at least for the patrol break up. If you don&#39;t  know<br/>\nFear well for the love of God wait until the patrol is broken. I imagine<br/>\nthat safe time would be around 3-4 hours after the initial zone in.<br/>\n<br/>\nObjectives:  <br/>\nKill patrol  <br/>\nwork toward the Gorgan tower  <br/>\nuse gorg tower as a base to kill the 3 mini bosses  <br/>\nKill lower Mobs  <br/>\nkill temple  <br/>\nwork to Cazic  <br/>\nKill Cazic <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get a glut of folks I hope that they will cooperate and do rounds in<br/>\nwaves non-stop. If this is the case you can assign wave leaders once patrol<br/>\nis broken. If you&#39;re not up, sit down, don&#39;t move or cast. Every bit<br/>\ncontributes to link death after 50 people so be warned. <br/>\n<br/>\nSUICIDE RUN<br/>\n<br/>\nA very fat tank needs full armor, spirit of the wolf, and lots of buffs on<br/>\nto pull the entire patrol with him/her on a wild goose chase to the north<br/>\nthus claering the port for the wave behind. 2 or more may be used but it is<br/>\nbetter to save extra tanks to be buffers near the North camp in case a<br/>\ncleric pulls some heat and is getting hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the plan I posted for a raid on Tarew Marr that was able to break<br/>\nand hold the zone with minimal casualties:<br/>\n<br/>\nI will do a suicide run to the north wall and draw fire (patrol mobs) until<br/>\nwe have a good core of folks in the camp spot 12:00 of the fire ring at the<br/>\ntemple. The second wave should have a few clerics and a few tanks, if I miss<br/>\nmobs on my first pass the other tanks should grab the mob and join me in my<br/>\nsuicide circle in the NW. Once the core clerics make it to the north camp,<br/>\ncamp. I will die in the NW corner and wait for my FD puller to get my<br/>\ncorpse. Other groups should follow immediately after the core clerics for 4<br/>\nreasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) More fodder for the patrol to get distracted on while the clerics camp <br/>\n2) More of a start up team to take down the glare lord should he be there<br/>\nwhen the re log procedure starts <br/>\n3) More people to to relog on before the clerics to make sure the coast is<br/>\nclear <br/>\n4) The window of opportunity to run in free of a patrol will only last about<br/>\n90 seconds before the patrol closes up again. After that window you must die<br/>\nat the patrol to join the break in or wait until the patrol is clear.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you agro the patrol go die in the NW corner and don&#39;t train the camp. Go<br/>\nin invis. because if I do my job right all the see invis mobs will be<br/>\nchasing me around the north end of the zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go in the first wave here is what to expect: <br/>\nI will get some buffs and wolf and port in. About 10-20 seconds later<br/>\nsomeone in my group will give a GO! This means zone in. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you zone you will see an hr glass to the right of you hovering in the<br/>\nair. Make a b-line for it. When you get close to it (not too close mind you,<br/>\nthat tower has crap that wants to kill you) head north toward the fire wall.<br/>\nOnce there skirt the outside of the firewall to the left (clockwise) until<br/>\ndirectly 12:00. There is a glare lord that cycles through this spot once<br/>\nevery 2 hrs or so, but is the only real obstacle here. If a scarling happens<br/>\nto get there by negligence run, don&#39;t walk with it to the west corner.<br/>\nScarling is the only monkey wrench in this as they can port you into the<br/>\nfirewall and bring the whole Amygalian Army on top of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we stabilize the North camp we can proceed to take down the shiverbacks<br/>\nand spine chillers first. Then move on to scarlings proceeding with extreme<br/>\ncaution. Scarlings should be mem blured because once you get high on the<br/>\nagro list they start porting you around. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout getting ported:  You will always be able to see the camp from where<br/>\nyou are ported or feared. Don&#39;t panic. Look around 360 to check your agro,<br/>\nif you picked something up go kite it in the NW corner until we can eat it<br/>\nor you die and we rez you later.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
