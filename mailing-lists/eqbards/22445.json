When I&#39;ve been memorising songs in a newbie area,<br/>\nthe greenest of the greens will still attack me because I&#39;m sitting down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I don&#39;t have anything to add as a potential strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;answer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wizard.  She&#39;s not out to kill me, just to get an item back.  Currently<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;immobilized and she&#39;s sitting a little ways in front of me medding.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her, then evade and hope that it would attack the medding 45 wizard in<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;path before continuing on to me.  (I want it to stun her so I can flee<br/>\n&gt; &gt;before she gets another root off)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Probably not, since in order for a monster to switch targets, it needs to<br/>\n&gt;have distance issues.  If you can&#39;t move farther from the wizard, that<br/>\n&gt;skelly will just ignore her and move on to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FYI 14 vs 45 - just give her the darn thing back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
