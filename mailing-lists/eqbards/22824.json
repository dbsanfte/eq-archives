It was not until 47 that I<br/>\ngot good at pulling singles (from the PoF cave).  Other stuff already posted<br/>\nabout harmony and lament too.  But the rule of thumb is let the higher level<br/>\nperson pull.  Granted, I have lamented froogs in seb and that let our level<br/>\n59/60 puller get singles where he would get multiples w/o lament.  But your<br/>\nbest bet is to have the higher level folks pulling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Malin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Thanos0000@...\">Thanos0000@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 21, 2000 2:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Tatsukawa&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Just following up on an old thread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was level 41 last night (42 now) and me and a ranger friend, Deerwen,<br/>\n&gt; (level 45) fought a bunch of spectres last night. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
