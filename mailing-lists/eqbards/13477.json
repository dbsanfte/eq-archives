Most people<br/>\nagreed that the reason Lamented mobs still aggroed was due to a pathing bug.<br/>\nThat is what I assumed was causing the problem but I just wanted to make<br/>\nsure.  Thanks everyone for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Lament question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed that either one of two things will happen when a mob resists<br/>\nthe Lament song.  Sometimes when you get the resist message the mob doesn&#39;t<br/>\naggro and remains where he is at.  You can then reattempt to Lament them.<br/>\nOther times, the mob will aggro as soon as you get the resist message.  It<br/>\nappears that a second resist check is made if the mobs resists the initial<br/>\nLament attempt.  If the mob fails the second resist check, he doesn&#39;t aggro.<br/>\nIf he makes the second resist check, he aggros on you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
