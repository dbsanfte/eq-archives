It s just not that simple.  No Drop solves absolutely nothing.  If it was No drop, they d just have a level 50 friend kill the mobs that drop the quest ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-398210146\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;earlier post, I feel that wearing Lambent should automatically reflect the<br/>\n&gt;effort and time that I personally have put into my bard character by its<br/>\n&gt;presence on my character&#39;s body.  This would occur if Lambent armor was NO<br/>\n&gt;DROP.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Crier<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just not that simple.  No Drop solves absolutely nothing.  If it was No<br/>\ndrop, they&#39;d just have a level 50 friend kill the mobs that drop the quest<br/>\nitems while their 9th level bard stood by ready to loot.  Then they&#39;d have<br/>\ntheir level 50 friend hand them the plat to buy the gemstones.  Then their<br/>\nlevel 50 friend would escort them to the temple to turn in the stuff to get<br/>\nthe No Drop armor.  Then they&#39;d switch roles and do it for the other.  The<br/>\nLambent would be No Drop and they still would get it if they wanted to with<br/>\nreally not much more effort.  Unless you want to make even Plat No Drop,<br/>\nwhich still would only slow it down, or make mobs unlootable except by the<br/>\nindividual that caused the most damage, which would make bards pointless<br/>\nforever, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, solved by making an item No<br/>\nDrop.  I a level 50 group wants they can equip each other&#39;s 1st level<br/>\nnewbies each with a Guise of the Deceiver and its No Drop.  I saw a level 1<br/>\ndark Elf Paladin on E&#39;ci two nights ago.  If he can do it so can they.  No<br/>\nDrop might make it a bit tougher, but it does nothing to make it impossible.<br/>\nNo Drop is the worst cop out solution I have encountered in nearly 15 years<br/>\nof gaming, precisely because it does not work.  It sounds good, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop anything except trading in the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has two really huge misconceptions that make absolutely zero sense.  <br/>\nNumber 1 is that No Drop is more than a minor deterrent.  Anyone that wants<br/>\nto and has friends can get around No drop except where a level limit is<br/>\nimplied like in the planes.<br/>\nNumber 2 is that trade skills allow you to make money from nothing whereas<br/>\nhunting does not.  Both hunting and trade skills use the same currency for<br/>\ncreating money, time.  Nothing more.  A level 9 can hunt Orc pawns till he<br/>\nis blue in the face wit no fear of dying and make more money than he can<br/>\nspending the same amount of time in a trade skill.  Why?  because Verant<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to grasp the fact that the trade skill is different only in the<br/>\nform of entertainment it supplies.  You still trade RL time for EQ money.<br/>\nEither way it is just the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
