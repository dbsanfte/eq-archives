I only hope I can get out of Sol B before it<br/>\ndegenerates to the state of your server.  Right now on Prexus, if you have<br/>\nthe pool room, you have about 15 greater kobold spawns that are all yours<br/>\nand all the spawn points cycle every 25 minutes.  Luckily people are kind<br/>\nenough not to pull through you (so far), which means a constant barage of<br/>\nXP.  Has anyone tried Paw?  Over camping of Lower Guk and Sol B was the<br/>\nreason that &quot;new&quot; Paw came into existance I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 33rd song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 22, 1999 9:45 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Re: Grrrrrrrr!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SolB is so camped on E&#39;ci the line to get in starts in Nek Forest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lower guk live-side is the place you wanna be, much less camped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I read these posts about clearing all the greater kobolds and just<br/>\n&gt; chuckle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you can get in to SolB, and are able to pull more than 3 kobolds<br/>\n&gt; then go for it, I&#39;m sure the birthday man is right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ludvaraman<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Amen brother (on the Sol B part at least...

It beats anything else out there hands down, including<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   giant charming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Third,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I and others have made posts about Djarn (Efreeti Lord Djarn)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   on this list about 2 or 3 weeks ago I&#39;d say.  And I made the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   very specific comment that he is deep, deep, deep inside SolB.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Deep enough and well guarded enough that it takes a minimum of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   two high level groups to reach him.  This should at least clue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   those few people who actually read these emails &gt;8)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   As far as measuring distance in terms a L1 bard can understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that important to do, however I don&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   tracking in outdoor zones unless I&#39;m after a random, roaming,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   or rare spawn.  Even if I could try to explain how close I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   need to be to track Krak Windchaser (now I&#39;ll have L10 bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   hollering at me, because they don&#39;t know that NPC - gimme<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   a break heh) it would be in terms of hills and trees and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   topography.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   So how far is bard tracking in simple terms?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I can find any named mob in most dungeons (SolA, Perma,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Crushbone, etc).  This is sufficient enough to make tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   useful, although druids at 20 skill can see very similar things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   that I can see.  They just dont get a wee bit of extra range.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Where the ranger gets a wee bit longer range than us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Verant didn&#39;t really think through the tracking and how the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   skill affects radius.  Because I&#39;ve looked at my tracking and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   a druid&#39;s tracking at the same time (2 computers, 2 accounts)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   and they look the same.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I guess my point is not how Tracking works, which is what you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   lower level people want to know... it&#39;s how far in comparison<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   it is working.  And the answer is there isn&#39;t a big difference.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Plus........... it&#39;s my birthday in 2 days, so I get to be right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   for once here, and you all can be the ignorant ones =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
