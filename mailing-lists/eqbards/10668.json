Just another slap in our collective bardic faces<br/>\nfor those of you high enough level to be slapped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Armor Recap and New Item Posted Monday, November 29, 1999 by Fyndhorn<br/>\nTo recap from my earlier update, Imbrued Platemail armor hasn&#39;t been found<br/>\nfor a while on any server. It is &quot;supposed&quot; to drop from Scorn Banshees,<br/>\nfemale zombies from PoH, but it currently does not drop at all. So hopefully<br/>\nby next patch, Verant will fix that up for all the Bards out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to equipment, Innoruuk from PoH seems to carry a HUGE plethora of<br/>\ndifferent items, and so we have found a new item drop from him today: the<br/>\nShield of the Immaculate, yet another item for Paladins only, which brings<br/>\nthe total of Paladin only stuff to 1 billion (j/k =p). Check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Equipment: Shield of the Immaculate <br/>\n<br/>\nBards&#39; Imbrued Platemail Armor Posted Sunday, November 28, 1999 by Fyndhorn<br/>\nAs rumor has it, the BRD-only armor from PoF and PoH called Imbrued<br/>\nPlatemail hasn&#39;t been dropping at all since the Plane of Hate was first<br/>\nintroduced. Basically every mob in both the PoF and PoH have been killed and<br/>\nnot one piece of Imbrued has been dropped on the Fennin Ro server, so if<br/>\nanyone has any info on what mob currently drops this armor, please drop us a<br/>\nline: EQ&#39;lizer Staff</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
