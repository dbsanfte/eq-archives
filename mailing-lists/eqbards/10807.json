By twisting Chords and Hymn<br/>\nyou could probably beat some of the lower level wisps fairly easily with a<br/>\nlute.  For easy magical gloves I would suggest running to Lower guk, scary<br/>\nbut if you are not agnostic and have not killed any frogloks you will be<br/>\nignored and can wait at the zone line for someone to get some near there<br/>\nsafely.  Another possibility is woven/mesh/netted gloves.  All are magical<br/>\nand cheap now that monks have Gauntlet of Wu to acquire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...
