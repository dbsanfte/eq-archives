This occured in late/mid<br/>\nBeta 3 and lasted for about 3 weeks.  It was a bug and it took them a while<br/>\nto figure out what they broke when they modified our songs.  This was also<br/>\nduring the time when they broke the music in EQ.  Actually they broke ALL<br/>\nsounds in EQ.  Everyone had to disable their sound cards to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards were fixed later on.  A lot of people who joined beta during that<br/>\nmixup were under the false impression that that was the way bards had been<br/>\nall along.  It wasn&#39;t.  I started playing during Beta 2.  My bard always<br/>\nsang only to her group except when they caused that bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this puts a stop to this misconception ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBeta 2 to Present<br/>\nBard - 30, 50, 35 (Beta, Test Server, Veeshan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
