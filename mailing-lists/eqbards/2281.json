Those mino axes make any<br/>\nbard look menacing, but are just too heavy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I arrived, the throne room was empty of everything, the room behind was<br/>\nclean as a whistle, and the Tower- camped by a Dwarven Cleric named Molasar. I<br/>\nasked if I could help with DVinn a time or two, so that I could get a dirk, and<br/>\nhelp him get one as well. He immediately showed me one in the trade window. He<br/>\nstated that he&#39;d beaten DVinn 13 times so far, and sold as many dirks. He wanted<br/>\n20 platinum for one, but I wanted to pull it from the Dragoon&#39;s bloody hand!  I<br/>\nstayed around to kill a few prophets and emissaries, then a cleric and his<br/>\npaladin friend were benevolent enough to help me. We eventually got 3 dirks in<br/>\n45 minutes or so. It was great fun teaming up to win the prize, and not just buy<br/>\nit. It makes things much more interesting for me, and more gratifying.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Shulzari<br/>\nPoswardd E&#39;ci<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
