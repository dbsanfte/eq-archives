This list will be posted","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684555170\">Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list <br/>\ndedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>\nThis list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n05/23/2001 - Updated the weapon list. Added info on Sainy&#39;s Claw. If you <br/>\nhave any other instruments or weapons that should be added, please send the <br/>\ndetails to the list (with spoiler space, please)<br/>\n<br/>\n05/23/2001 - Added some FAQs on general list information, updated some FAQs <br/>\n(Clarity, item swapping).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any suggestions, corrections, or frequently asked questions, <br/>\nplease let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, some basic rules:<br/>\n(Common sense stuff, really)<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible). While we do often stray off the <br/>\npath of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to <br/>\nour readers. Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards <br/>\nhave DoTs. Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not. Discussions of <br/>\nQuests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space <br/>\n(several blank lines) to let people know in advance. If you MUST post <br/>\nsomething off-topic, please make it brief and put [OT] in the <br/>\nheader.  Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so <br/>\nwill be immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning. On a related <br/>\nnote, if you notice that your topic is straying from the original thread, <br/>\nplease change the subject header.<br/>\n  Example: RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a <br/>\nBard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest <br/>\nversion, if you can make an attempt to change the subject field to <br/>\nsomething appropriate, that would help those of us not digesting our mail <br/>\nbetter pass it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) No Flaming. Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please <br/>\nbe considerate of one another. Take a moment to read through, and then make <br/>\nsure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily. We&#39;re all <br/>\nhuman, and no one likes to be called names. If you simply MUST insult, <br/>\nbadger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s. KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is <br/>\nbeing forcibly killed. This sometimes happens when a thread has degenerated <br/>\nsufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or when the <br/>\nsubject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.Kabongs <br/>\ngenerally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) No Attached Files! If you wish to share with us your latest picture, <br/>\nsome nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within <br/>\nyour email to an appropriate place online. If you have no access to such, <br/>\nemail the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and <br/>\nfollow up to the list with the URL. Small infractions will probably be <br/>\noverlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who <br/>\nhave to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum, and <br/>\ntry not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you should <br/>\nalways make sure that the message you are sending is properly referenced, <br/>\nso that people reading the messages out of order are not completely lost. <br/>\nAnd try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or <br/>\nincomprehensible euphemisms. Plain, clear speech is much more effective, <br/>\nand will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages... Also, use spoiler<br/>\nheadings and/or spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Remember that, according to Verant&#39;s new policy, anything you say can <br/>\n(and apparently will) be held against you. Our email list is private as far <br/>\nas posting privileges, but the archives are open for public viewing. So <br/>\nplease, if you have an active EQ account, don&#39;t send anything to this list <br/>\nthat&#39;s likely to get you banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, enough rules. Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n* * NEW * * Q: How do I unsubscribe?<br/>\nA: All list controls are accessed by going to the Yahoogroups webpage <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/)\">http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/)</a>. If you are unable to do that, <br/>\nsend an email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n* * NEW * * Q: Are there any archives?<br/>\nA: Yes - (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/messages/)\">http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/eqbards/messages/)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQ: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; - <br/>\nWhat do they all mean?!<br/>\nA: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless plug). <br/>\nBriefly, those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to spells/effects <br/>\nthat do damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at once), <br/>\n&quot;Direct Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their damage at <br/>\nonce), &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon, &quot;MM&quot; is Mistmoore, a <br/>\nmid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ is Geoffrey Zatkin, the<br/>\nVerant Designer in charge of spell balance (and thus a frequently consulted <br/>\nindividual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how <br/>\ndo I do it?<br/>\nA: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although much deprecated by those in <br/>\nfavour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple songs at once - or at <br/>\nleast making it seem that way. The short explanation is to stop one song <br/>\nand immediately start another one, repeat as necessary. Since most song <br/>\neffects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you have time to weave as many <br/>\nas three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs at once before the first <br/>\nwears off, gaining the effects from all of them at once. The long <br/>\nexplanation, complete with illustrations, can be found <br/>\nhere:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html\">http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html</a><br/>\n(thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level? What does this song do?<br/>\nA: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s Guild <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of spellsongs, <br/>\nhowever, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let me refer <br/>\nyou to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqsongs.com/\">http://eqsongs.com/</a> (The Bardic Song Analysis page), compiled by <br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong (This site no longer appears to be active, however, I am <br/>\nattempting to contact the author for permission to mirror it). Also, the <br/>\nSoerbaird is a wonderful site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,\">http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,</a> and the <br/>\nConcert Hall seems to have a good collection of Bards posting on the <br/>\nmessage boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,\">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,</a> and the EQ Diva website <br/>\nis a great new resource: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqdiva.com/\">http://www.eqdiva.com/</a><br/>\n(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What do instruments do?<br/>\nA: Some songs have associated instruments. Playing this instrument will <br/>\ngenerally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related to <br/>\nyour relative skill with the instrument. Also, instrument skill is <br/>\npartially responsible for failure rate of related songs. To avoid missing <br/>\nnotes, even when singing, keep your instrument skills maxed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>\nA: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world. <br/>\nArranged by Strings, Percussion, Brass, Wind, in apparent order of value.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisera Lute (Unknown) Stringed instrument, used in quests. Not known if it <br/>\nhas any bonuses.<br/>\nThe Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found on Mynthi Davissi in Mistmoore) <br/>\nwhich has about a 5% improvement on stringed songs (only really noticeable <br/>\nafter 47th level).<br/>\nThe Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in that it <br/>\nis for a specific quest), which has about a 5% improvement on stringed <br/>\nsongs (only really noticeable after 47th level), and +5% Magic Resistance. <br/>\nIt&#39;s found in the same area as the Lute of the Gypsy Princess (above), but <br/>\non the generic Gypsy Musicians.<br/>\nLyendlln&#39;s Lute (Found in the Siren&#39;s Grotto on an unknown mob) Stringed <br/>\ninstrument that adds +10 AC, +25 HP, and enhances stringed songs by about 20%.<br/>\nKelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (Found in the Plane of Hate on Maestro of <br/>\nRancor) which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9 AGI. It also seems to add about 20% <br/>\nto stringed songs. Also called the &quot;Maestro&#39;s Lute.&quot;<br/>\nLyran&#39;s Mystical Lute (Found in Veeshan&#39;s Peak on Silverwing) Stringed <br/>\ninstrument that adds +10 STR, +10 DEX, +10 INT, +15 CHA. It is unknown what <br/>\nbonus, if any, it gives to Stringed songs.<br/>\nLute of the Howler (Found in Velketor&#39;s Labyrinth on Khelkar Icepaw) <br/>\nStringed instrument that can be held in the primary, while a weapon is <br/>\nwielded in the off-hand. Appears to give about a 15% increase to stringed <br/>\nsongs. Has Effect: Illusion Werewolf (+100 attack, +30 STR, +40% Haste)<br/>\n<br/>\nDrums of the Beast (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on a Shimmering Spirit) <br/>\nPercussion instrument which appears to have a permanent Enduring Breath <br/>\neffect while held. It is unknown what bonus these drums give to percussion <br/>\nsongs (although it&#39;s rumoured to be VERY high). It can only be held in the <br/>\nprimary slot.<br/>\nMahlin&#39;s Mystical Bongo&#39;s (Given by Baenar Swiftsong in South Karana) <br/>\nPercussion instrument - gives no statistic enhancements, but does appear to <br/>\ngive an 8% improvement for drummed songs. This is part of the Bard Epic <br/>\nQuest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>\nThe Mistmoore Battle Drum (found on Mynthi Davissi in Mistmoore) Percussion <br/>\ninstrument - which increases the effects of most drummed songs by about 15%.<br/>\nWalrus Skin Drum (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on unknown mob) Percussion <br/>\ninstrument, which increases the effects of most drummed songs by about 23%.<br/>\nSharkskin Drums (Found in Kedge Keep on Coralyn Kelpmaiden) Percussion <br/>\ninstrument - which appear to increase effects of drummed songs by about 25%.<br/>\nNostrolo&#39;s Tambourine (Earned via Quest in Firiona Vie) Percussion <br/>\ninstrument - which gives +5 INT, as well as adding 20% to drummed songs. <br/>\nAnd, hey - it&#39;s NO DROP! (This is a good thing)<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Drums of the March (Found on Nagafen in Nagafen&#39;s Lair) Percussion <br/>\ninstrument - which increases the effects of most drummed songs by 35%.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlluring Horn (Found on Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears) Brass <br/>\ninstrument - it appears to negatively impact songs. Don&#39;t use it! It&#39;s part <br/>\nof the Bard Epic Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>\nConch Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto and Cobalt Scar <br/>\non Sirens) Brass instrument, appears to give about a 5% bonus to brass songs.<br/>\nImmaculate Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto and Cobalt <br/>\nScar on unknown mobs) Brass instrument which adds +15 CHA, but has a <br/>\npenalty of -8 STR. It appears to have about a 15% bonus to Brass songs.<br/>\nDenon&#39;s Horn of Dissonnance (Obtained through a Plane of Air quest - Bard <br/>\nTest of Brass) Brass instrument, which adds +5 STR, +5 INT, +10 CHA, +50 <br/>\nHP. It does not appear to give any increase to Brass songs, however, unlike <br/>\nmost instruments, you can wield a weapon while holding this one.<br/>\nMcVaxius&#39; Horn of War (Found on Lady Vox in Permafrost) Brass instrument, <br/>\nwhich adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 CHA and increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>\n<br/>\nLianna&#39;s Flute (From Regis the Reverent, used in a Cleric quest) Wind <br/>\ninstrument - no known special effects.<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo (Found on Cazic Thule) is a wind instrument. Not <br/>\nsure if it has any added effect.<br/>\nThe Unicorn Horn (found on Equestrielle in Lesser Faydark), acts as a <br/>\nGreater Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument. It also has 5 <br/>\ncharges of Purge. It may have up to a 10% bonus on wind songs.<br/>\nFaun Flute - (From Fauns and Faun Stewards in the Wakening Lands) Wind <br/>\nInstrument that gives +6 CHA, but no other known bonuses.<br/>\nAglimente&#39;s Flute of Flight (Formerly obtained through a Plane of Air <br/>\nquest) Wind Instrument that gives +4 STR and +2 INT, but it is unknown if <br/>\nit adds any to wind instruments.<br/>\nFlute of the Sacred Glade (Found on Prince Thirneg on the Plane of Growth) <br/>\nWind instrument that adds +4 WIS, +8 CHA and +10 vs Disease. It does not <br/>\nappear to add any bonus to wind songs.<br/>\nMinotaur Horns (Found on Minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of King <br/>\nXorbb) *wind instruments* (not Brass) which appear to add about 15% to wind <br/>\nsongs. They are also easily found, and lighter than flutes.<br/>\nBrahhm&#39;s Horn (Found in the Gorge of King Xorbb on a named Minotaur) Wind <br/>\nInstrument - which is exactly like a minotaur horn, and adds 15% to wind songs.<br/>\nScorpion Pincer (Found on scorpions in the Field of Bone), which adds 15% <br/>\nto wind songs, and has the appearance of a Minotaur Horn.<br/>\nBroken Minotaur&#39;s Horn (from the Minotaur Lord in Steamfont) is a wind <br/>\ninstrument like regular minotaur horns, however, it is heavier and adds +10 <br/>\nto SV. vs Poison, and it&#39;s No Drop!<br/>\nErvaj&#39;s Flute of Flight (Obtained through a Plane of Air Quest - Bard Test <br/>\nof Pitch) Wind instrument which adds +8 STR, +10 STA, +5 INT, +10 CHA, and <br/>\nenhances wind songs by 60%.<br/>\n<br/>\n* * * Note: The Lizard Scout Fifes (Found on Lizard Scouts in the Feerrot) <br/>\nand the Froglok Escort Fifes (found on Froglok Couriers in the Swamp of No <br/>\nHope) are quest items, and not playable instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are new instruments still being discovered, so if you find any <br/>\ninformation, or have a correction to this list, PLEASE let me know!<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>\nA: Weight and cost. Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What&#39;s with all these instrument parts I keep seeing? (Unfinished horn, <br/>\nlute strings, mouthpiece, raw bamboo, etc.)<br/>\nA: Nobody knows. Rumour has it, there was to have been another tradeskill: <br/>\n&quot;Instrument making&quot;, but nothing has ever been confirmed. In the meantime, <br/>\ndon&#39;t accidentally buy an unfinished horn, because believe me, they just <br/>\ndon&#39;t play the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What ever happened to the Practice Lute and Small Brass Trumpet that <br/>\nwere supposed to be mid-level bard instruments?<br/>\nA: These items were never added to the game, and they apologized for saying <br/>\nthat it was.<br/>\n(Gordon Wrinn, October 10, 2000 on General Discussion Board)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Are there any good quests for a Bard?<br/>\nA: Yes, there are many &quot;good&quot; quests for Bards, although much better ones <br/>\nare found by completing other class-specific quests. Allakhazam&#39;s Quest <br/>\nSpoiler Database is probably the single-most complete compendium of quests <br/>\nthere is - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html\">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Where IS Fabian???<br/>\nA: He&#39;s in East Freeport in the Grub and Grogg Tavern by the docks. But <br/>\ntrust me - it&#39;s just not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while <br/>\nswinging a sword?<br/>\nA: Unfortunately, no. While instruments are off-hand only items, they are <br/>\nalso considered two-handed. Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash <br/>\nmonsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level? Where should I <br/>\nhunt at this level?<br/>\nA: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; weapons especially for Bards?<br/>\nA: Yes, while Bards can take advantage of many different weapons, there are <br/>\nseveral known Bard-specific weapons in the world:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhistling Dagger (In the Mines of Nurga off of unknown mob) Piercing 6/25. <br/>\n+1 AC.<br/>\nBlade of Fiery Lamentations (In Kaesora off of Strathbone Runelord) <br/>\nPiercing 5/18. Procs Fingers of Fire (AE 28 damage)<br/>\nSainy&#39;s Claw (In the City of Mist off of some Golem) Piercing 6/19. +10 AC, <br/>\n+3 INT.<br/>\nSainy&#39;s Singing Dagger (In Temple of Droga from unknown mob) Piercing 7/22. <br/>\nProcs Symphonic Harmony (Lowers mobs &quot;Hate&quot; to the Bard.)<br/>\nSionachie&#39;s Partisan (In Karnor&#39;s Castle from the Caller of Sathir) <br/>\nPiercing 9/19. +2 INT, +6 CHA, +5 MR.<br/>\nBreath of Harmony (In Old Sebilis from the Blood of Chottal) 1H-Slash <br/>\n(Primary only) 10/18, Effect: Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation.<br/>\nHarmonic Dagger (In Karnor&#39;s Castle off Drolvarg Warlord) Piercing 10/21. <br/>\nProcs Tishan&#39;s Clash (55 damage, 4 second stun)<br/>\nHarmonic Spear (Bard&#39;s Test of Harmony in the Plane of Air) Piercing <br/>\n(Primary only) 10/21. +5 STR, +5 DEX, +5 CHA. Procs Chant of Battle - bugged.<br/>\nSymphonic Saber (In Chardok off of multiple creatures?) 1H-Slash 11/23. +5 <br/>\nINT, +10 CHA. Procs Symphonic Harmony (Lowers mobs &quot;Hate&quot; to the Bard.)<br/>\nMelodious Truncheon (In Charasis off of Bile Sentinel) 1H-Blunt 11/23. <br/>\nProcs(?) Melodious Befuddlement (Stun effect). Appears as a Lute.<br/>\nEvensong (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of Rancor) 1H-Blunt 11/25.<br/>\nSix Note Blade (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of Rancor) 1H-Slash <br/>\n11/25.<br/>\nSinging Short Sword (Epic Quest reward) 1H-Slash 16/26 +15 STR, +10 DEX, +5 <br/>\nSTA, +20 CHA, +100 HP, +10 to all SV. Procs Dance of the Blade (55% haste <br/>\n+str +atk)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What kinds of armour should I look for, specifically made for Bards, and <br/>\nwhat does it look like?<br/>\nA: There are seven sets of Bard-specific armour. All use the plate-armour <br/>\ngraphic set. The number in parentheses after the armour is the suggested <br/>\nlevel for acquiring (although with good guild help or twinking, earlier is <br/>\npossible).<br/>\n<br/>\nLambent Armour (20+), which is available through a series of quests in the <br/>\nTemple of Solusek Ro is a deep, rich blue.<br/>\nImbrued Armour (46+), which comes from the Plane of Hate, is a strong gold.<br/>\nSinging Steel(40+), found on various high-powered mobs in Old Sebilis and <br/>\nKarnor&#39;s Castle in Kunark, is a sea-foam green. Singing Steel pieces also <br/>\nhave right-clickable effects associated with most of the pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Velious, you can quest for two of the remaining four:<br/>\n<br/>\nResonant (50+), another deep blue armour, which is quested for in Thurgadin;<br/>\nTroubador (55+), which is quested for in Kael Drakkal, and originally came <br/>\nin a teal guardian armour look, however, in a recent patch it was retinted <br/>\nto a more burgundy shade.<br/>\nMelodic (50+), which is found in the Plane of Growth, uses the guardian <br/>\narmour look, and comes in shades of grey or silver.<br/>\nHigh Sun / Twilight armour(55+) (they changed the name from High Sun to <br/>\nTwilight) is dropped in Skyshrine. It used to use a yellow guardian armour <br/>\nlook, but when they changed it to Twilight armour, they changed the tint to <br/>\ndark grey.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>\nA: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 (or <br/>\nmore) empty boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it. This is the <br/>\n&quot;hotkey&quot; box. Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your <br/>\nkeyboard, but you can reconfigure that through the options settings. Songs, <br/>\nspells, the spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made <br/>\n&quot;hotkeys&quot;. To create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want <br/>\nand HOLD it down. After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and <br/>\nattach itself to your pointer. Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the <br/>\nappropriate hotkey slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey. Now, whenever you <br/>\npress the associated hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or <br/>\naction in that slot. Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in <br/>\nyour hotkey bank is simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap <br/>\nitems in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>\nA: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General <br/>\ninventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work. Bag slots will NOT) into <br/>\nyour hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an <br/>\ninstrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever. PRACTICE THIS <br/>\nMANEUVER!!! You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and <br/>\nmore likely several times, so practice practice practice! And if you *do* <br/>\naccidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and <br/>\nrun like crazy. It also helps to set your drop item confirmation to &quot;ON&quot; - <br/>\nso that you don&#39;t accidentally drop something valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>\nA: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This <br/>\nmeans that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield, <br/>\npick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of <br/>\nthem, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and 75 <br/>\nfor Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these <br/>\nskills. Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration speed <br/>\nfor your party members?<br/>\nA: No. Here - let me emphasize that: NO!!!!! What the Jig does is increase <br/>\nthe rate of Stamina Regeneration every six seconds and hence the display of <br/>\nthe Stamina, Health, and Mana bars to show this increase. Without the song <br/>\nplaying the bars are refreshed every eight seconds. The ultimate effect of <br/>\nthis is that the mana bar &quot;moves&quot; every six seconds instead of every eight <br/>\nseconds so it APPEARS to be moving FASTER. In actuality - it is moving 75% <br/>\nof the distance it would move if it waited the other two seconds. So bottom <br/>\nline, it LOOKS like it is regenerating faster but it does not. If you don&#39;t <br/>\notherwise have a need to regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized <br/>\nsong slot.<br/>\nOr you can just use GZ&#39;s short answer: &quot;Urban Myth - Jig only gives fatigue <br/>\nback.&quot;<br/>\n(Geoffrey Zatkin, Archmage of Norrath [And Verant Game-designer], November <br/>\n18, 1999, in a letter to Rokenn Swiftsong)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity)?<br/>\nA: &quot;There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon <br/>\non your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 <br/>\nseconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this <br/>\nmeans that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the <br/>\nsong effect going indefinitely.<br/>\nSome Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the <br/>\nBard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again. <br/>\nCassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it <br/>\ndoes not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.&quot;<br/>\n(Geoffrey Zatkin, December 2, 1999, in &quot;Arch Mage Answers&quot; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, Absor confirmed that Kendrick (one of the programmers) said this:<br/>\n&quot;Chorus of Clarity is not actually a buff. To equate it to a hitpoint <br/>\nspell, it&#39;s similar to, say Healing, whereas Soothing is more like <br/>\nRegeneration. CoC gives the recipients a direct shot of mana every time the <br/>\nbard song pulses, unlike Soothing, which is basically a mana regen spell, <br/>\nincreasing the rate at which you regain mana.See the difference?&quot; (Absor <br/>\nfor Kendrick on the EQ Developer&#39;s Corner forum board - April 9, 2001)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Does Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding work against undead? Why does it work <br/>\nsometimes and not others?<br/>\nA: Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding has been posited to work differently from <br/>\nother invisibility effects in that it is level-based. It appears to work <br/>\nagainst anything - but only if that thing is of a certain level or below. <br/>\nThis is still being hashed out, but the best solution is to con everything <br/>\nyou see while &quot;clouded.&quot; If it cons indifferent, you&#39;re invisible to it. <br/>\nOtherwise, RUN!<br/>\n<br/>\nQ. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash or 2-handed blunt?<br/>\nA. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on the <br/>\ntrainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a Bard. This is apparently <br/>\njust something left over from Beta.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>\nA. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I <br/>\nwill say this: No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will <br/>\neventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and <br/>\njewelry.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ. What&#39;s the command for &lt;foo&gt;ing?<br/>\nA. Well, I don&#39;t know how to foo (not sure that I want to) but there is a <br/>\nnearly complete list of commands at (shameless plug one last time)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqcommands.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqcommands.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of <br/>\nquestions.
