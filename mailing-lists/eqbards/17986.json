So we had non stop action and at times there were<br/>\n3/4 kobolds coming at us that agro from other rooms, I was using charm and<br/>\nafter a 4 kobold fight my mana was down 2 bubs. I sat and med but it didn&#39;t<br/>\nregen fast enough, looks as though this song now uses 20 mana per cast<br/>\ninstead of the original 5 mana. Ok ok, you must be wondering why I am using<br/>\nthe level 39 charm song on kobolds? Well, some Solusek Kobolds are too<br/>\nhigh, so I just use the level 39 song to avoid this....we was also pulling<br/>\nbats/bugs so it&#39;s handy to have for that too. It looks as though this song<br/>\nis gonna have to be used in rations....<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 45 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kevin L.
