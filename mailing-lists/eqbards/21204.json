When <br/>\n&gt; i am the haster<br/>\n&gt; (IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which i LOVE, <br/>\n&gt; the agi buff<br/>\n&gt; gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask since its <br/>\n&gt; high level<br/>\n&gt; song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str boost I <br/>\n&gt; think the haste<br/>\n&gt; effect is the same)<br/>\n&gt; (This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>\n&gt; Beserker.&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and shoulders.  What do you all<br/>\n&gt; reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists, CHA, and <br/>\n&gt; STR (in that<br/>\n&gt; order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me looted it <br/>\n&gt; not knowing it<br/>\n&gt; was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted bronze cloak <br/>\n&gt; (UGH!) and a<br/>\n&gt; straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have about 2k <br/>\n&gt; right now and<br/>\n&gt; dont really have trouble making money, though I would rather <br/>\n&gt; go get a guild<br/>\n&gt; run to get new items...
