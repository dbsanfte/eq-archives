First of all, how exactly do you drink the alcohol you purchase?  I know it is a silly question but I have never tried before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, being lvl 5, I just got my Selo&#39;s song and purchased a drum.  However, every time I equip the drum and attempt to play the song, it tells me to stick to singing until I learn the instrument.  Is it a thing you can practice at the guild?  The missed note got me stomped by a hill giant yesterday.  Do they always attack on sight?<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, where is a good place to hunt at lvl 5-10?  I tried to go to the second zone out of Freeport and all there was were Kodiaks, young Kodiaks, and of course my friend the giant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, did anyone else get screwed by the server shutdown yesterday?  For the first time since I began playing EQ, I had finally found a good group and 30 minutes into our escapades, the messages from the gods came in suggesting that we camp so that they could shut off the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear with us newbies, I realize that most of the people that respond on this list are anywhere from lvl 18-50, but you have the stories and the knowledge to pass down through your posts.  Its very much like an extension of the game.  That is what we as bard&#39;s do for a living!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help!  This really is the best mailing list I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
