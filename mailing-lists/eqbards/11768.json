Let me ask you a question.<br/>\n&gt;Do the people playing &quot;Monopoly&quot; play for competition or for fun?<br/>\n&gt;Imagine the shoe bought all properties at a 1% discount.  Would<br/>\n&gt;that make you want to be the shoe?  What if that discount was 10% or 25%,<br/>\n&gt;or higher? Eventually it won&#39;t be fun to be the hat, because the shoe<br/>\n&gt;will almost always win.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EQ is a lot like this skewed Monopoly.  The shoe is the unbalanced<br/>\n&gt;class, and those that like the Hat or the Thimble want the shoe<br/>\n&gt;balanced.  This IS competition, and a lot of people that play, do so<br/>\n&gt;for competition, and their fun comes from the competition, not from<br/>\n&gt;the play.  That is not a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve had this same discussion going on for about - god...can it be<br/>\nalmost 3 years now?...over on the UO front.<br/>\n<br/>\nA virtual world is a new genre - it is not Quake, it is not a board game,<br/>\nit&#39;s not even a paper and pen D&D game. A virtual world is persistent, not<br/>\nsession based. A virtual world will never be &#39;winnable&#39;. There may be<br/>\ninstances of competition internally (i.e., duals, contests, games, etc.)<br/>\nbut the competition is geared against the world itself - surviving and<br/>\nexisting in it - not necessarily against other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nA &#39;game&#39; IS competitive - it&#39;s designed to have a winner - it&#39;s setup that<br/>\nway. That does not mean you can&#39;t enjoy the play aspect of it as well - but<br/>\nit&#39;s a forgone conclusion before a &#39;game&#39; starts, someone is gonna win,<br/>\nsomeone is gonna lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why designers need to decide upfront - is this &#39;just a game&#39;, or is<br/>\nthis a &#39;virtual world&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShow me what in EQ &#39;let&#39;s you win&#39;? Level 50 - nice things?  Ya know,<br/>\neventually everyone that is persistent enough at trying will get that same<br/>\nthing. If you look at others achievements as somehow diminishing your own -<br/>\nyou are superimposing your own personal competition on the world at large. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first watershed in a virtual world is the question &quot;Can you win?&quot;. EQ<br/>\nhas a problem here - it WANTS to be a virtual world - but by setting itself<br/>\non a level based system it gives the illusion you can WIN.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
