Actually, anyone who can get there<br/>\nfrom where ever you are is invited and welcome. Hint, hint: Japhia, Mac and<br/>\nother Michigan, IL, IN, IA & MN players.  My place is easy access from the<br/>\ninterstate and there&#39;s a good variety of motels nearby if you wanna<br/>\novernight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy game room has 2 EQ pc&#39;s networked and sharing 128k ISDN so I think we<br/>\ncould add a couple more if you want to bring your stuff.  Also, I have 2<br/>\nanalog telco lines that could be used.  And if some one has AD&D or other<br/>\n&#39;pen & paper&#39; rpg, I&#39;d love to see how that works too!<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone is invited and welcome - drop me an e mail to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>  and<br/>\nI will send you my phone number, directions & a map and that will also help<br/>\nme know how many can actually make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. this started as an idea for some local friends who play on Innoruuk<br/>\nserver but if any EQ players are in/near Milwaukee and want to drop by -<br/>\neveryone is welcome!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
