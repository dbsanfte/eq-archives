I<br/>\n\t\twas holding the final, crucial piece after a week of<br/>\n\t\tquesting.  I was in High Hold Pass, the meeting was an<br/>\n\t\thour away, so I start burning towards Lesser Fey with<br/>\n\t\tthe final ingrediant.  After the zones, the boat trip,<br/>\n\t\trunning throung Greater Fey, all the guildsay is<br/>\n\t\tbascially &quot;is he here yet&quot;.  I&#39;m blazing, I look down<br/>\n\t\tto grab my drink, I look up and I&#39;m leaping from the<br/>\n\t\ttop of the wizard gate at full speed.  This was back<br/>\n\t\tbefore high level clerics where running around all<br/>\n\t\tover the place.  The guild decided to go ahead without<br/>\n\t\tme, as I was bound in HHK.  I was soooooooo mad.  Now<br/>\n\t\tit seems funny, but man...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tLlewrend Lynnhaven</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
