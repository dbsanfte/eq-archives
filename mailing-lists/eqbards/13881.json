It also makes it 12x harder<br/>\nfor the group to get the special item.  They cancel out.  <br/>\nWell, maybe the group gets to see who the kill stealer(s) is<br/>\nbefore they lose the item.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, that was why I said maybe the named mob should just<br/>\ndrop on top of your while you are fighting.  It doesn&#39;t reward<br/>\nthe parasitic opportunists that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of mobs dropping on top of you...  My paladin friend<br/>\nwas soloing a bit in LGuk a couple nights ago.  He was<br/>\nfighting in the halls (dead side).  He&#39;d fight one mob, other<br/>\npeople&#39;s pulls would ignore him.  I joined him.  Other<br/>\npeople&#39;s pulls saw the bard singing a song, and decided they<br/>\nhated the bard more than the person pulling them.  Bleh.  I&#39;d<br/>\njust assumed all this time that mobs other people were pulling<br/>\nwould attack you if they saw you fighting another mob (the<br/>\n&quot;help a friend&quot; AI).  I didn&#39;t realize it only happened to<br/>\nbards.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
