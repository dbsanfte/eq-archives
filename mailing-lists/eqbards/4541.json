I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>\n&gt;had to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>\n&gt;Many of their spells at higher levels are just improved versions of<br/>\n&gt;spells they had at lower levels.  They don&#39;t really have to worry about<br/>\n&gt;memorizing their low level spells once they reach a certain point.  That<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t the case for us.  With a few exceptions, almost all of our songs<br/>\n&gt;each have their own unique effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually find it harder to decide with my level 9 shaman than my<br/>\nbard.  I have 7 useful buffs (mana&#39;s the limiting factor), 3 useful<br/>\ndamage spells (1 dd + 2 stackable DoTs), 1 good debuff (slows<br/>\nattack speed).  Fortunately I get double duty out of the buff Inner<br/>\nFire.  It restores hit points, as well as upping your total.  It is actually<br/>\nmore mana efficient than minor or lesser healing (1-1 mana for hp, where<br/>\nInner Fire is 1-1.9 at level 9).  I never have this much trouble deciding<br/>\nwhich songs to mem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt higher levels it gets worse, as there are more buffs and debuffs<br/>\nthat all stack (quickness and regeneration at 24).<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the strategy of playing these classes is spell/song selection,<br/>\nso I doubt we&#39;ll ever see more spell slots.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
