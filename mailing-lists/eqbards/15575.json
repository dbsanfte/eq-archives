He talks mainly about the lifespan of EQ.  At the very end<br/>\nof the post is the following comment:<br/>\n<br/>\n(I didn&#39;t realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we<br/>\ncomplain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied<br/>\nit, but I think &quot;They doth protest too much&quot; to paraphrase &quot;THE BARD&quot;) <br/>\nAgreed. <br/>\nThanks very much for your comments. <br/>\n-Brad <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had the time to read the Gameplay forum to get the full context of<br/>\nthe thread but the way I interpret it someone posted that bards protest too<br/>\nmuch and that Brad agreed.  Am I misinterpreting this or has our class now<br/>\ngained the reputation at Verant as a whining class?  If the original poster<br/>\nwas referring to John Kim&#39;s post concerning lullaby I don&#39;t see how that can<br/>\nbe interpreted as a protest.<br/>\nOf course, the quote &quot;Thou doth protest too much&quot; could be a reference to<br/>\nWilliam Shakespeare, which my Alabama high school education did not give me<br/>\ntoo much exposure to:-)<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
