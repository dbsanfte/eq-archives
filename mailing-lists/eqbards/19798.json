But I DO want my<br/>\nregular buffs to flash before wearing off. I would be satisfied with several<br/>\nin particular:<br/>\n<br/>\nEnduring Breath<br/>\nInvisibility<br/>\nInvisibility to Undead<br/>\nLevitation<br/>\nIllusions (dark elf, erudite, iksar, and whatever other masks the make for<br/>\nus)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these spells carry your our lives in their hands. If they break at<br/>\nthe wrong time without us knowing it&#39;s coming, we are dead. The more I think<br/>\nabout it, the more certain I&#39;m going to post to the official boards, I just<br/>\nkeep forgetting to test Kit&#39;s theory on the icons not flashing only when<br/>\nwe&#39;re singing. Hopefully I&#39;ll remember tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n*ties a string around his finger*<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

Our group<br/>\nmembers do.  For a groupmate of a bard the icon will flash.  For the bard<br/>\nit&#39;s on solid.  TRUST ME you don&#39;t want flashing icons.  Icons start to<br/>\nflash roughly 15 seconds before a spell effect wears off, this means our<br/>\nicons would ALWAYS flash since our song duration is shorter than the<br/>\nflash-warning time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
