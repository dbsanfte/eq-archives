I was in LoIO earlier<br/>\nthis week and saw an Iksar Exile walking by with a Icebone Skellie walking<br/>\nabout 100 yds behind.  I decided to mez the Exile until the skellie caught<br/>\nup then charm the skellie to kill the Exile.  I hit the Exile with the Pixie<br/>\nStrike.  The Exile didn&#39;t resist but immediately came over and started<br/>\npounding on me.  I went ahead and meleed him until the Skel caught up.<br/>\nThirteen seconds or so after the original Pixie Strike I got a message<br/>\nsaying that it had worn off.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
