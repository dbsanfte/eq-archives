I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>\ndisbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>\non during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>\nguild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>\nthrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>\nspecifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>\nany trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>\nat week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>\nup in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>\nwas the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>\n(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>\nguild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>\nplay after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>\nSomething else?<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 52 Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
