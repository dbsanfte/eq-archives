Don&#39;t feel bad if you are asking more than what you <br/>\n  think the worth of something is, regardless of how easy it was to<br/>\n  acquire.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tailors sells 10 slot backpacks for 75pp+ (I&#39;ve seen them at 125pp)<br/>\n  And the tailor needs those (very rare) HQ bear pelts to charge that<br/>\n  much to those people who want the packs.  Those pelts are worth <br/>\n  minimum... 10pp, and that&#39;s very low.  I see them sold for around<br/>\n  20-25pp average, but look at the profit the tailor makes, you could<br/>\n  charge more for the pelts.  What&#39;s he gonna say, I&#39;ll go buy those<br/>\n  pelts from someone else?  Just laugh at them, those pelts are rare.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Trust me, a L50 cleric, L50 shaman, and me cleaned Rathe Mountains<br/>\n  for 2 or 3 hours of bears and got only one HQ pelt.  That&#39;s about<br/>\n  200-300 bears dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
