I would imagine that at my<br/>\nlevel (46) resists will prevent me from using any offensive songs for the<br/>\nmost part. Am I correct in thinking this?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any tips on tactics and any special eqipment that I might<br/>\nfind useful, for instance do I need any extra resist gear?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be most grateful if someone with more experience could post a guide<br/>\nto the planes from a bards perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternativly can any of you point me in the direction of a good guide to the<br/>\nplanes, preferable one that tells me what to excpect as a bard?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I got my Tamborine a while ago and its great. Inaddition it is one of the<br/>\nbest quests I have seen anywhere, it made me drag my guild through half of<br/>\nKunark. I would stronly recommend this to any bards with a good level 40 ish<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nBruen Bladesong<br/>\nCitizen of the Avengers Federation<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
