Verant, in<br/>\ntheir zeal to make things difficult at higher levels to slow<br/>\nus down, has so narrowed the margin between easy and hard that<br/>\nthere&#39;s very little room in there for good tactics to make a<br/>\ndifference anymore.  At lower levels, you could take on a<br/>\nclose fight and good tactics could make the difference between<br/>\nbarely winning, or realizing halfway through that you&#39;re going<br/>\nto lose and running.  At higher levels, the margin is so slim<br/>\nthat the luck of the die rolls can easily swamp out the effect<br/>\nof good tactics, and you&#39;ll die before you can run.  So you<br/>\nresort to doing the easier fights, which don&#39;t require good<br/>\ntactics and tend to be rather boring.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
