Since","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1607831897\">That would seem to indicate you could not stand in front of any aggressive<br/>\nmob while playing invis.  When the song visibly pulsed he would attack you.<br/>\nSince this does not happen, I have one theory why not which explains another<br/>\npeculiarity I noticed.  It seems that mobs rather than having an agro<br/>\nrefresh rate, have an agro scan rate.  Each pulse the mob checks to see if<br/>\nanything is in his agro range that he wants to attack.  Unless this happens<br/>\nto pulse just when your invis pulses he will never see you.  The other thing<br/>\nI noticed is that I have many times now run directly under Griffennes at<br/>\nfull speed trying to pull them back to a group, only to have to circle<br/>\naround and do it again because the Griffenne apparently did not see me the<br/>\nfirst time.  I can only conjecture that I was running so fast I cleared the<br/>\nGriff&#39;s agro radius before his agro pulsed a second time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 11:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dual Bard Invisibility Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 4 Jan 2000, Bill Mann wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I encountered this also when I was camping the Icy Greaves in Perma a<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; back.

Someone yells train.  I start<br/>\nInvis.  All of us flicker out of view well before the train<br/>\narrives.  I tell him to turn off his song NOW.

The train runs back<br/>\ndown and makes a beeline for the bard playing Hymn.  (We<br/>\nbarely get out, he dies.)  There is some debate as to whether<br/>\nthe train actually saw him playing Hymn, or if invis dropped<br/>\non him due to PL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d died earlier (stupid gargoyle got a double hit for max<br/>\ndamage on me just as I was about to hit the zone) and needed<br/>\nto loot my corpse.  A lot of people are parked outside in LFay<br/>\nso I asked the same bard to play invisibility to let me check<br/>\ninside for a train.  I zone in, no train.  I begin to loot,<br/>\ngrab my mino horn, equip it, and play invis.  Other bard zones<br/>\nin, starts up invis himself.  People bring a minor train to<br/>\nthe zone.  I finish looting and watch.  Target a mob and start<br/>\n/conning it over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, this is me and the other bard both playing invis at<br/>\nthe same time.  *Every* time the song graphics were present<br/>\n(glowing ball), the mob /conned &quot;ready to attack.&quot;  The moment<br/>\nthe song animation ended, the mob /conned &quot;indifferent.&quot;  I<br/>\nhit the /con button over and over for 2 or 3 pulses and it<br/>\nswitched between &quot;indifferent&quot; and &quot;ready to attack&quot;<br/>\ncompletely in synch with whether or not the song graphics were<br/>\npresent.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
