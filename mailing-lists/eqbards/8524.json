You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should have offered to trade :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From a reliable source.. Guides do not get *any* of their<br/>\n&gt; class&#39;s spells or songs. They also do not get any<br/>\n&gt; instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>\n&gt; to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>\n&gt; another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>\n&gt; saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
