It is bard only and a horn graphic but it is only range<br/>\n&gt;equipable. It has a clickable slow and a load of awesome stats. I think it<br/>\n&gt;dropped off something or other in VT. They logged me on to loot it so it<br/>\n&gt;would not rot. They say it&#39;s effect doesn&#39;t stack with our slow song. I<br/>\n&gt;haven&#39;t had a chance to test it yet. They also got the ancient mana song for<br/>\n&gt;me. I have not had the time to play in the last couple weeks due to an<br/>\n&gt;avalanche of RL stuff. Nothing bad, just loads of various crap that leaves<br/>\n&gt;little time to play.
