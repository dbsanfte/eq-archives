I had a great weekend in EverQuest and have to share with you guys.  I<br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t mean this as a boast, but real life&#39;s random number generator<br/>\ncan be as clumpy as Verant&#39;s and here&#39;s proof.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday night:<br/>\nMy guild is doing Hate so of course I&#39;m there.  Within the first hour of our<br/>\nbreak-in both Imbrued Arms and Gauntlets dropped.  The only other bard<br/>\npresent is maxxed in Planer equipment and weapons so of course I got them.<br/>\nCrier is happy happy.  Several hours later we take Innoruuk down (having<br/>\nbypassed the Maestro) and he drops a Dawnchaser (piercing 11/25, BRD only) -<br/>\nthe only other bard present already has one the only one on the server<br/>\n(Druzzil Ro), so I got it.  Crier is ecstatic and goes to bed at 6am.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday Night:<br/>\nCrier logs in at 5pm and ask the guild what&#39;s up.  &quot;Plane of Sky&quot;  Ok<br/>\ngreat..  So not 20 minutes after logging in I&#39;m sitting on the wiz pad in<br/>\nNek waiting for a port up listening to my guild killing Azaraks on isle two<br/>\nand it&#39;s getting messy.  Three Az down and almost everyone dead.  &quot;BARD<br/>\nBELT!  Get Crier up here!&quot; is being called from PoS.  A wizard ports to me,<br/>\nports me in to Sky, I buy a key and suicide run to the belt and get it.<br/>\nBelt of Concordance (AC 6, STR 5, CHA 5, SV Poison +5, Effect: Haste) is<br/>\nbasically a Flowing Black Silk Sash with really nice bard stats.  I gladly<br/>\npass down my fbss to a guildy rogue who needs one (this is how my guild<br/>\nworks).<br/>\n<br/>\nLater Saturday Night:<br/>\nMy guild decides to back off of Sky and assess what we&#39;ve learned before<br/>\nspending another 20kpp, so we leave sky around 10:30pm my time. and disperse<br/>\nfor experience camps.  Another guild is in Plane of Fear and has been<br/>\nclearing all night.  Around 1:30am that guild gives up Fear for sleep and<br/>\nsays that if our guild wants Cazic Thule that&#39;s ok with them.  Since my<br/>\nguild doesn&#39;t sleep, we leave our experience camps and set up in Fear, kill<br/>\na couple dozen mobs and then drop Cazic with little difficulty around 5:30am<br/>\nSunday morning.  Among other stuff Cazic drops a Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo<br/>\nand I&#39;m the only bard present.  At this point I try hard to defer the<br/>\npiccolo to another guildy bard because I&#39;m getting embarrassed at having<br/>\ngotten so much stuff.  The other bard refuses to accept it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Imbrued Arms and Gauntlets<br/>\n- Dawnchaser<br/>\n- Belt of Concordance<br/>\n- Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in two evenings.  Hot damn.  Further evidence that good things come if<br/>\nyou persist long enough.  Stick with your bards folks, we&#39;re a great class.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeekends like this are why I&#39;m still 48 though.  There&#39;s literally around 25<br/>\ndeaths in that weekend.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
