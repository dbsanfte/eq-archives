I&#39;ve been part of this list for over two months.  Did<br/>\nyou suddenly decide to bring this up this time because all I said were three<br/>\nwords.  How is that any different from the person that said &quot;Great story&quot;?<br/>\nSo what if my signature file has a few lines of advertising.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nposting here all this time to hear about and contribute to the bard class in<br/>\nEverquest.  I though the story about the take down of Lord Nagafen was very<br/>\ncool.  I would love to be a part of that someday.  If someone comes in here<br/>\nspamming the mailing list with advertising, great ban them I&#39;m all for that.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not even close to what I have done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nFor great simple at home income opportunities check these out:<br/>\n1.
