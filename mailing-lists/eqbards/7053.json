Kim<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Based on the numbers we have, i would tend to agree with John that over time,<br/>\nthe difference between slow and fast weapons (with the same ratio)is<br/>\ninsignificant, because that is what the damage/delay ratio tells us, as to how<br/>\nmuch damage a weapon does per second.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the only part of this i disagree with is the rewards for taking risks<br/>\nsystem.  i don&#39;t know that it is necessarily 100% accurate.  Mine i think is<br/>\nthe case example.  for 8 levels, i have been in North Karana Kiting/Meleeing<br/>\nbeetles (Pincer, Borer, Scythe).  At level 18, the Scythe Beetles gave me 3<br/>\npossible cons (Blue, white, yellow) and they only range 17,18,19.  Because we<br/>\nhave no HARD NUMERICAL DATA on XP (boy, would i love to see some), it is very<br/>\ndifficult to tell, but i was watching my XP bar very closely (as i had nothing<br/>\nbetter to do).  Not only did i get the same XP from the Blue, White, or yellow,<br/>\nbut the Borer beetles (14-16 lvl range) would usually (probably the 15&#39;s and<br/>\n16&#39;s) would give me the SAME xp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, i think specifically for bards (especially if soloing) it is important<br/>\nto play the averages and try to cut out as much variability and deviation as<br/>\npossible.  We miss A LOT! With a big damage, slow delay weapon, some of my<br/>\n*safe* fights would be deadly.  I use a Mithril Quill and A Dragoon Dirk (4/19,<br/>\n6/23).  As I have noticed that i can accumulate more XP by reducing downtime<br/>\nand fighting as many of the *safe* fights as i can [ie-not taking any big<br/>\nrisks], I really NEED to know that the random number generator is not going to<br/>\nbite me too hard.  This may change for me as i get higher level and actually<br/>\nstart grouping with my friends : ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, i am not a powergamer just level crunching to 50, but i have<br/>\nbeen powerleveling to catch my friends (who are 24-26 and waiting for me).<br/>\nI abandoned my cleric because bards are far more entertaining.<br/>\nerr...i guess that is an unintended bad pun...sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid (yet to be determined...suggestions on last name anyone?)<br/>\n20th song<br/>\nWave of the Dark Tide (err...i&#39;m half dark elf... :-) )<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
