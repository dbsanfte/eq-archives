I disagreed with Harm in that most of the<br/>\nhits from lower level mobs are not within the 80% of max area.  However, if<br/>\nyou take out just the hits for 1, suddenly the remaining hits are again<br/>\nmostly within that 80% of max window.  That makes me think there is either a<br/>\nbug in the damage calculation, or, that when you eliminate damage due to<br/>\ndamage avoidance as opposed to absorption you take a minimum of 1 no matter<br/>\nhow much you would have absorbed over the amount done.  For example all hits<br/>\nare avoided with damage avoidance do 1.  All other hits do their full damage<br/>\nminus X.  Since their full damage is actually a much higher range in general<br/>\nthan your absorption, you only see a lot of high number hits, but as<br/>\navoidance goes up, you see many more hits for 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 22, 2000 1:05 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] UPDATE 2 - we&#39;re getting there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 22 Mar 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow I disagree with Harm??? Unheard of almost.  Actually you might as well<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you meant you disagree with me.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; be right though.  From the parsings I&#39;ve done a mob will. regardless of<br/>\n&gt; level, hit you for 80% of its max or more 80% or so of the time it hits<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; for more than 1.  As you go up in levels you should see more misses and<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; hits for 1, at least thats what my logs have shown so far.  The amount of<br/>\n&gt; hits I see between 1 and 80% of max hasn&#39;t changed much for most mobs<br/>\n&gt; despite gaining 12 levels since I started checking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich supports what I wrote.  As I&#39;ve increased in level, the<br/>\naverage damage I take from a hit has gone down.  If I&#39;d meant<br/>\nmedian or mode, I would&#39;ve said so.  :P<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 22, 2000 12:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] UPDATE 2 - we&#39;re getting there!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would wait to see how much damage the ubermobs do against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appropriate level players before deciding.  When I was in my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teens, giants almost always hit for 100+.  Now that they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; green to me, they miss a lot and seem to average around 30-40<br/>\n&gt; &gt; per hit. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Giants have and will always hit for ~96 dmg.  Your level makes<br/>\n&gt;   little difference in the amount of the attack.  Yes, they miss<br/>\n&gt;   you a lot more often, but a L42 ice giant&#39;s consistant hit is 116,<br/>\n&gt;   it was 116 when I was L14, and it still is 116 at L50.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Regardless of level the monster will strike usually in the upper<br/>\n&gt;   80% of their damage range unless they outright miss you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; MAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
