Gives you a lot more time to help bring down the first mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo more things worth mentioning:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Is Mez (Pixie) sticking more for anyone else? It&#39;s sticking (just<br/>\nguessing) about 50%+ for me instead of 25-33% w/ CHA at 103. I didn&#39;t time<br/>\nthe duration (prob the same) but just seemed a lot more effective than<br/>\npre-patch for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Stacking problems. I haven&#39;t tried a lot of combinations, but can<br/>\nconfirm that SOS and Niv&#39;s don&#39;t stack anymore. I could have sworn that<br/>\nthat they did pre-patch, so I think this is a buffing nerf. Could someone<br/>\nelse confirm this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTzeetch on Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
