I m a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-267423109\">This is pretty exciting, I think.  You&#39;re right in that some of the answers<br/>\naren&#39;t what we wanted to hear, however, I think it&#39;s pretty much to be<br/>\nexpected.  Few probably care, but here&#39;s my take on these answers:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>\n&gt; break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to<br/>\n&gt; be able to<br/>\n&gt; add new abilities to Bards as the game continued.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a little bit disappointed in this, but it&#39;s not that big a deal to me.<br/>\nI&#39;m not on the list of people who feel that the game is &quot;unfinished&quot;, but I<br/>\nwas hoping those songs would make it in, especially now that I&#39;m approaching<br/>\n39th  ;)  The songs that we have in our repertoire are sufficient to get<br/>\nthings done all the way through 50th IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alenias Disenchanting Melody<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: I will check this one out.  It *should* cast cancel magic on<br/>\n&gt; your entire<br/>\n&gt; group - and did at one point of beta.  It is high on my list of things to<br/>\n&gt; check out/get fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Holy cow!  This would have been more than just a little bit useful in<br/>\nBefallen at level 22.  It would have saved me several nasty DoT deaths.  FIX<br/>\nTHIS ONE!  When I&#39;m hunting (err.. dying) in Kithicor now I&#39;d have it memmed<br/>\nright beside Selo&#39;s.  This would allow me to at least be in motion when I<br/>\ndied.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; GZ: Well, i just fixed the horn.  We should have a drum at some time - I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t know when.  Sorry.  I think we will try to sneak it in on our<br/>\n&gt; next graphics patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;We should have a drum at some time&quot; implies that they simply don&#39;t have a<br/>\ndrum graphic to give us.  Therefore it wasn&#39;t something that they could have<br/>\nfixed in the last emotes animation patch.  If that&#39;s the case it might be<br/>\nsome time before we get the drum.  It&#39;d be nice, but it&#39;s not keeping me up<br/>\nnights.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I have been pleasantly surprised with the new emotes.<br/>\nMost of them are pretty funny and/or well done.  It&#39;s nice to actually bow,<br/>\npoint, etc.  The other nice thing that happened to us is that we no longer<br/>\nlook like we&#39;re standing when playing Hymn with an instrument after battle.<br/>\nMany times I&#39;ve had to explain to someone in my group that in fact I *was*<br/>\nsitting, it just didn&#39;t look like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right click on a spell can see what skill the spell uses<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This would be nice.  At 31st I still have to look up a couple of the less<br/>\nfrequently used songs to see what skill they might use.  More importantly<br/>\nnewer bards would be able to find out that Selo&#39;s was &quot;Skill: Percussion&quot; or<br/>\nthat Lullaby was &quot;Skill: Strings&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: A lot of these skills are &#39;given&#39; to Bards, even though they<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t ever<br/>\n&gt; get good at them.  I&#39;ll check on the caps with one of the<br/>\n&gt; programmers, but I<br/>\n&gt; doubt that will change much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with this take believe it or not.  Bards are an amalgamation<br/>\nof various other classes.  We have a very impressive list of skill and<br/>\ncapabilities.  True, few of our skills are the best version of those skill<br/>\nwhen compared to the other classes that receive them, but we do *get* them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 30th level necro friend of mine (Hi, Evanya!) has started a bard based in<br/>\nno small part on grouping with me a lot and seeing how much fun I have.<br/>\nCyricc, the new bard, was asking questions about our skills when confronted<br/>\nwith leveling up to 10th.  I put it thusly: &quot;Bards have very many of the<br/>\nskills that other specialize in.  Since we have skills from all other<br/>\nclasses it is only just and fair that we either get the skill later<br/>\n(Clarity: Enchanter 29th, Bard 32nd) or that it isn&#39;t quite as strong or<br/>\nquite as useful (Forage, Safe Fall, Charm, Melee)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have all had virtually every other class say to us &quot;Damn!  You bards get<br/>\nthat skill TOO?&quot;  You&#39;ve got to expect that in the name of class balance<br/>\nthat some of those multitudinous skills be weakened from their parent class&#39;<br/>\nversions.  So when I think of these skills I may be envious of how much<br/>\nbetter another classes&#39; version works (i.e. Forage, Charm, even Melee), but<br/>\nI take solace in the fact that I even *have* all of those skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; GZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.  We had it<br/>\n&gt; breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too<br/>\n&gt; powerful, since it<br/>\n&gt; is a free song that bards keep mem&#39;d all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think we had all suspected that Selo&#39;s breaking root had been deliberately<br/>\nchanged while they were in fixing the Selo&#39;s/SoW issues.  Selo&#39;s breaking<br/>\nroot *was* very powerful, as you not only broke root but were in Turbo Mode<br/>\nwhen it broke.  That said, the song that we wouldn&#39;t keep memmed all the<br/>\ntime and that *should* break root is Disenchanting Melody, and it&#39;s broken.<br/>\nSo let&#39;s hope ADM gets fixed very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A) make Selo&#39;s work indoors, or B) to not allow SoW and Jboots to work<br/>\n </span></blockquote>indoors?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: Possibly.  But remember - Bards are similar to Hybrid spell casters on<br/>\n&gt; their power levels - they are not pure spell casters - their<br/>\n&gt; songs won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; as powerful as a pure caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GZ&#39;s comments reiterate what I said above.  As for Selo&#39;s not working<br/>\nindoors, its a real bummer alright, but again I don&#39;t see it as being the<br/>\nend of the world.  I&#39;m just one more gal standing in line in front of the<br/>\nDruid before we go into Permafrost.  If they fix this, it is likely the SoW<br/>\nand JBoots will get cancelled indoors IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; memorization time being reduced in the future?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: That is something that we will be talking about at our next tuning<br/>\n&gt; meeting - possibly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not much to say.  I hope they help us out here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Crisson&#39;s Pixie Strike seems to be bugged.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ: I&#39;ll check on that one - not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mumble, mumble, mumble.  Pixie Strike is BROKEN.  So is Lullaby.  I was<br/>\nTRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot; message<br/>\nfor EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really aggravating.<br/>\nIt&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; GZ: Hope that helps a bit.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does..<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 31st song bard on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
