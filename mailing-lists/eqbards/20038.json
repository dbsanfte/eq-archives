Just as a sanity<br/>\ncheck I had an enchanter friend mez the group of fifteen or so newbie mobs I<br/>\nhad in thrall, or not so much in thrall, 10 times.  He was only level 20<br/>\nhowever.<br/>\n<br/>\n150 \tattempted mez&#39;s<br/>\n9\tresists<br/>\n6%\tresist rate<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, that&#39;s right he got a whopping 6% resist rate and his spell lasted a<br/>\nheck of a lot longer than 6 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy conclusion was that we are about as good at crowd control with this song<br/>\nas we are at picking locks.  The only crowds we can control are the ones<br/>\nthat we would never encounter in an xp gaining venture, just like the only<br/>\nlocks we can pick.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
