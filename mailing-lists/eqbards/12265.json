I don&#39;t think our quests are all *that* easy.  I<br/>\n&gt; started doing them at around level 27 and I can assure you that I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; find most of them trivial.  My set wasn&#39;t complete until about 34th.  Sure,<br/>\n&gt; some pieces are easier than others, but even if you&#39;re simply looting quest<br/>\n&gt; items from other people&#39;s kills, it&#39;s still pretty risky.  The Dark Bone<br/>\n&gt; bracelet from the basement of Unrest, the Basalt Carapace from well inside<br/>\n&gt; Lower Guk, the Gypsy Lute from the heart of Castle Mistmoore, the Icy<br/>\n&gt; Greaves from the King Room in Permafrost, these are not easy things to get<br/>\n&gt; for a lower level bard even if you&#39;re scavanging other&#39;s kills.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong, 41st bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The bard quests may be easy at 30th level, but I have not found them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; particularly easy at 20ish.  On the other hand I completed my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fourth shaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; piece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; required killing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; including the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard pieces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make ours look<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many levels off for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; far beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are as weak<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their pieces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may be fairly difficult.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
