Personally, I have sung and played guitar off and on in<br/>\nseveral bands in my area for the last 7 years.  I have also helped record<br/>\nand produce several of my friends&#39; band&#39;s cd&#39;s (anyone ever heard of<br/>\nMiddlefinger?).  I am now working with some ex-bandmates writing bit music<br/>\nfor indy films (horror mostly).  I love my music in world and out.
