Fear is my panic button, when I<br/>\nabsolutely positively have to break off a melee or escape Fear is my goto<br/>\nguy. Everyday I have to go thru upper to get to lower guk, and stop at all<br/>\nthe spawn points in upper on my way. # times I have checked in on the Lord<br/>\nand gone LD just long enough to be seen by a pile of frogs. Instead of<br/>\nfighting and being gang-raped by greens I Fear them off me and dash to the<br/>\nLG zone. Its worked everytime so far, last time I made a train of at least<br/>\n25 Frogs in my dash and passed by a 47th Paladin friend going the other way,<br/>\nif toons could have surprise on there faces he showed it. There I was with<br/>\n25 frogs jumping every which way some Feared, some returning from being<br/>\nFeared, it was quite funny and is always a rush. I have made it all the way<br/>\nto zone from the tower in LG using this tactic as well(died more often than<br/>\nnot though, but corpse recovery was always easier). All in all Fear is one<br/>\nof our more versatile and important songs, and I would never have guessed it<br/>\nbefore getting it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: SteelWolf [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwlf@...\">steelwlf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 26, 1999 7:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Mid-level songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwlf@...\">steelwlf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used Screech everywhere from Unrest to Mistmoore, Sol B, and Lower Guk.<br/>\nHere are my two uses, and why I almost always have this song mem&#39;d at<br/>\n38th...<br/>\n<br/>\nSoloing - I made a good part of 30th and some intermitant experience after<br/>\nthat<br/>\nlevel soloing using screech. I&#39;ll use Unrest as my example. I know Unrest<br/>\ninside<br/>\nand out, having been a puller there since L18. At 30th, Carrion Ghouls and<br/>\nDry<br/>\nBones were blue to me, so I would pull one outside to a wall, Chain it<br/>\n(Selo&#39;s<br/>\nConsonant Chain) then hit it with Appalling Screech. As the monster slowly<br/>\nwalked away, I would chain again, then either hit it with 2 bellows or a<br/>\nheal<br/>\nand a bellow. When I solo, I fight completely unbuffed. Hitting the monster<br/>\nin<br/>\nthe back saves me from taking alot of hits I cannot afford to take. If I<br/>\npulled<br/>\n2 monsters instead of just one, I charmed the one I thought would win,<br/>\nordered<br/>\nit to &#39;/pet guard me&#39; then equipped my lute and played Hymn while<br/>\noccasionally<br/>\nreplaying Charm to keep the monster on target. I used this method the first<br/>\ntime<br/>\nI solo&#39;d the Undead Knight of Unrest at 36th, the second time I used a<br/>\nfestering<br/>\nhag to kill him for me (using charm, this was MUCH easier).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group - Screech is a devastatingly potent weapon in saving your parties<br/>\ncollective butt. In lower guk while fighting dar&#39;s, zol&#39;s and a few wan&#39;s<br/>\n(the<br/>\nL36-46 range of undead froggies) we got trained by the hand room. The group<br/>\nleader called for an evac, but we were all being mobbed, including the<br/>\ndruid. I<br/>\nhit screech. No less then 6 L40+ frogs fled in terror, and I was L36. All<br/>\nconn&#39;d<br/>\nblood red to me. The druid casted the evac successfully and we all escaped.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample 2: In Solusek B (Nagafen&#39;s Lair) my group got trained while fighting<br/>\nthe<br/>\nKobold King, a Solusek Kobold Shaman, and a Solusek Kobold. These are all<br/>\n38+<br/>\nmonsters. add to that 2 GK shamen and 5 Greater Kobolds (35ish). I as a L37<br/>\nsaw<br/>\nour main tank drop below 1 bubble and hit screech. WHAM! You see them ALL<br/>\nflee<br/>\nin terror! Quite impressive to see the kobold king flee in terror.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only warning: If you use this as an escape tool (group situation) and the<br/>\nmonster isn&#39;t snared, your group MUST zone. You will start a huge train<br/>\notherwise 90%+ of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast good use of this song - de-railing a train parked at the zone. I play<br/>\nit,<br/>\ncausing everything at the zone to flee in terror. I then zone. When the fear<br/>\nwears off, they no longer have a target on their aggro list (I have zoned)<br/>\nso<br/>\nthey simply go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy astounding results even with higher level mobs are with a 165 brass skill<br/>\n(for the last few levels). (max would be 190 right now)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell ThunderWolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\nprograms, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
