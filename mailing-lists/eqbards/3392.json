I noticed last night while<br/>\nweaving/juggling/mixing/cycling :-) Accelerando with the<br/>\nultravision song that if you start a song so that its effect<br/>\nkicks in the same instant it&#39;s previous pulse ends, the<br/>\nending effect takes precedence.  i.e. I&#39;d hit Accel, then the<br/>\nother song, then Accel again.  I got the pulse, the &quot;feet move<br/>\nfaster&quot; message followed immediately by the &quot;slow down&quot;<br/>\nmessage, and I was moving at normal running speed despite that<br/>\nI was still singing Accel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed that if someone in your party goes<br/>\nlinkdead while you&#39;re playing the invisibility song, they<br/>\nsometimes come back permanently invisible (until they camp or<br/>\nzone).  Dunno if it affects mobs, but it definitely affects<br/>\nother players.  Casting, attacking, etc. did not break it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
