He was wandering along the hill near<br/>\nthe road to the ramp.  He had no loss on his hp bar, and I even asked on<br/>\n/ooc if he was spoken for.  No one claimed him, so I decided to extract a<br/>\nlil revenge on the Chief ;o)  After I killed him, I get challeneged by some<br/>\ndruid.<br/>\n???<br/>\nIt turns out that this guy had been medding to get his mana up to kill him.<br/>\nI apologized, and explained that I had checked to see if he was taken and no<br/>\none responded.  This guy was so irked, that he didn&#39;t care.  As far as he<br/>\nwas concerned, I had KS&#39;d him on purpose.  Needess to say, after about 10<br/>\nminutes of accusations, being cursed out, and challenged over and over<br/>\n(using this time to heal up and mem songs for PvP ;o)~  ), I accpeted his<br/>\nchallenge and charmed him right off the bat.  Although I was resisted a few<br/>\ntimes, I managed to get him to where Sir Whats-His-Name and Squire Wembley<br/>\nand had him attack them.  They laid the big-time smackdown on him while I<br/>\nheaded for the NK zone to await that lovely yellow text that told me I had<br/>\nwon.  He logged off not long thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\n    If it had been a consentual thing (ie: &quot;Hey, you feel like dueling?&quot;), I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have done that.  If it had been a friend of mine and we were<br/>\ntalking trash, I wouldn&#39;t have done it.  If it had been over something<br/>\nreasonable (say the named MOB in HP that drops the PGT), I wouldn&#39;t even<br/>\nhave accepted.  But this guy was such a complete jerk, and was *so*<br/>\nantagonistic that I felt a mere defeat wasn&#39;t worthwhile.  I don&#39;t say it&#39;s<br/>\nfor everyone, but for me it fit the crime.  If that makes me &quot;nasty&quot;...<br/>\nguilty as charged   &gt;;o)~<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
