Playing against<br/>\n&gt; human brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>\n&gt; over and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about 48<br/>\n&gt; levels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>\n&gt; NPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it onver<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s actually one of the reasons I like PvE.  Because things<br/>\nare pretty much the same, I can do tests that are repeatable<br/>\nto figure out what does the most damage/time.  PvP tends to be<br/>\na lot less reliant on tactics (what you as an individual do)<br/>\nand more on strategy (what your group does).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; songs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have significant<br/>\n&gt; experience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable level<br/>\n&gt; and equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;ve done this several times.  The winning team was<br/>\nalways the one with more redundancy.  With a specialized team,<br/>\nonce you kill the cleric, it&#39;s pretty much over.  With<br/>\nredundancy, the other group tries to kill our cleric, who just<br/>\ngets healed by our druid and paladin.  Meanwhile we&#39;re busy<br/>\nkilling their cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do a web search on &quot;Trillion Credit Squadron&quot; you&#39;ll<br/>\ncome across one of the more interesting AI research projects.  <br/>\nThe idea behind TCS was to design a starship fleet based on<br/>\nthe Traveller rules and a set budget, then pit them against<br/>\neach other.  Some guy wrote a computer program to design the<br/>\noptimal fleet.  Turns out the optimal fleet was one where<br/>\nevery ship was the same.  It had no weak point, no capitol<br/>\nship - no head you could chop off.  After the computer program<br/>\nwon for 2-3 years in a row, they canceled the tournament.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, with the fix to our Chant songs (they now do a nice<br/>\namount of damage using a drum) and my acquiring a haste belt<br/>\nlast night, I now have lots of options in a fight than Hymn,<br/>\nNiv&#39;s, Verses, and CoC.  So I&#39;m happy with the state of a L50<br/>\nbard for the time being.  Still wish they&#39;d fix mez though.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
