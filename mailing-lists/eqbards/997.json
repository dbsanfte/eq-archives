Thanks for all the feedback on the Lull song.  Tried it last night <br/>\n&gt; and it worked great.  I&#39;m lazy and hate doing the instrument/weapon <br/>\n&gt; swap (Unless I&#39;m running that is... a giant can be very motivating :))<br/>\n&gt; so after I killed one goblin I just renewed the song on the other two <br/>\n&gt; etc. repeat.

I have heard that Wisps can drop great loot (lightstones) but you <br/>\n&gt; need a magic weapon.  What is the easiest/cheapest magic slashing 1h  <br/>\n&gt; weapon that I can lay my hands on? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Easiest is probably buying a combine weapon from any of the<br/>\ngypsy camps.  A combine longsword will cost a bard between<br/>\n52.5 to 60 pp with 6/28 stats.  A combine scimitar is 5/24<br/>\n(significantly worse) and only 39.9-45pp, and the aftermarket<br/>\nis slightly bigger since druids can use it.  A combine short<br/>\nsword is around 36.7-42pp at 4/23 (much worse).  If you&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen practicing your piercing skill and want the absolte<br/>\ncheapest, the combine dagger is 3/19 at 31.5-36pp.  (Upper<br/>\nprices are my estimates, lower prices are what I&#39;m charged<br/>\nwith 110 charisma.)  You may be able to get a better price<br/>\nfrom a player getting rid of his combine weapon.  You could<br/>\nalso have a shaman or enchanter cast a spell to enhance your<br/>\ncharisma to get a better price (which as someone else noted<br/>\nbecomes well worth it in this price range).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheapest is if you can find a player selling a magic weapon.  <br/>\nI hear tentacle whips go for about 20-25pp, but their lifetap<br/>\neffect screws up bard songs.  Most everything else is around<br/>\nthe price of an equivalent combine weapon or higher.<br/>\nCrookstinger is a magical piercing weapon which is found on<br/>\nthe king (queen?) giant wasp in lesser faydark and supposedly<br/>\nonly L10 or so, but I have yet to hear of anyone seeing this<br/>\nmob much less getting this item.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks can use netted/woven/mesh gloves to make their punches<br/>\nmagical.  But I&#39;m hearing conflicting reports as to whether or<br/>\nnot it makes the punches of non-monks magical.  Netted gloves<br/>\ncan often be bought for 5gp - 3pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  Throwing weapons....  I have been thinking about trying these for <br/>\n&gt; some time.  (Poor mans fetch spell)  Can you ever recover the dagger <br/>\n&gt; after you use it or is it lost for good?  Seems expensive if you have <br/>\n&gt; to replace them every time. (1s+ each)  Do they attract the mob even <br/>\n&gt; if you miss?  (funny image of dagger flying past the nose of Mooto the <br/>\n&gt; Goblin followed by a yawn.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You cannot recover them.  The cost is trivial at higher<br/>\nlevels.  At L16, I typically brought in 5-20pp in a night&#39;s<br/>\nplay, and rarely used more than 20 shurikens (2+ gp).  I think<br/>\nI spend more on food and water (which is kinda hard to forage<br/>\nin the desert).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey attract the mob if you miss, but not if your shot is<br/>\nblocked (by a person, tree, hill, whatever).  They are also<br/>\nuseful when you and someone else see a mob at the same time<br/>\nand race to see who can engage it first to claim it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
