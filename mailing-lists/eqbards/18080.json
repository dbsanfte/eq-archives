(unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>\nwould&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.  no<br/>\nmore runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  (fbss only likely<br/>\none now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in group<br/>\naccording to guild rules)<br/>\n<br/>\ni need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>\ndifferent players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>\n<br/>\ni tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the guild<br/>\nare pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>\nitem. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders get whines and<br/>\nrants all the time, so our chances of convincing them otherwise is very<br/>\nslim.<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reply is very late in coming, and I apologize if the thread has been <br/>\nclosed or kabonged.  I haven&#39;t had much time the last week to read my Email, <br/>\nand am just now getting to it.  However, this post stuck a chord with me (no <br/>\npun intended), and I felt it necessary to reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder no circumstances would I remain in a guild that treated me in such a <br/>\nmanner.  If I was present to help kill the critter that dropped an item I <br/>\ncould use, I would expect to be included in the lottery if I didnt already <br/>\nhave the item, or one better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis treatment of bards is ridiculous, and I believe that this type of <br/>\nthinking needs to be quashed now before it spreads to other guilds and <br/>\nservers.  Its bad enough we often get the back-hand treatment from Verant, <br/>\nbut should we allow our guilds/friends to treat us in the same manner?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
