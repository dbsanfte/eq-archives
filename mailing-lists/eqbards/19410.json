You are not &#39;officially&#39; in the<br/>\noutpost and can be bound there.  No nasties come to this area and it is<br/>\nrelatively safe for the good races.  You must swim back out and around or<br/>\nusing invis song you can walk down to there.

After<br/>\ndiscovering that I could bank/trade in the evil outpost (Mask of Deception<br/>\ncombined with Bristlebane worship combined with Carillon gives you amiable<br/>\nfaction), I&#39;m now inclined to think there may be a spot safe for us to get<br/>\nbound.  Couple of reasons for this.  Aggro ranges for most mobs in Kunark<br/>\nappear to be very short.  One of the entrances into the outpost is a hallway<br/>\nguarded by two gargoyles.  The hallway appears to be long enough so that if<br/>\nyou got bound in the middle of it, you wouldn&#39;t aggro a gargoyle or<br/>\nwandering guard should you get killed and reappear at your bind point.<br/>\nGetting out while naked may of course present another problem but with Selos<br/>\nI assume we should be able to speed past the gargoyle until safe.  Screech<br/>\nand Lament and Sneak skill may also be of use in this situation.  If it<br/>\nworks then it might be worth the risk to get bound there versus binding in<br/>\nFV and running naked through three zones (FV, Dread, FM) to get back to your<br/>\ncorpse.  I&#39;m willing to test this out by binding in the outpost then dueling<br/>\nsomeone.  Also will need to make sure my guildmates are nearby in case the<br/>\nSHTF.  But if someone else has already tested this then it will save me the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
