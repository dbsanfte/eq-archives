What class/race are you<br/>\ncurrently having the most fun playing? <br/>\nGZ: I have got to say that I love my 1/2 elf Bard - but mostly because when<br/>\nI play, I am a very social player. Bards are good at being social. In fact,<br/>\nI built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played a lot of EQ,<br/>\nand tend to change my opinion every few weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 48 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
