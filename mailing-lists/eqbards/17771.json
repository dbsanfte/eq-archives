I have had some zoning issues as well, both in<br/>\nLavastorm and OOT.  I zoned into OOT from Butcherblock, only to find myself<br/>\non the sister isle.  This has happened a couple of times and is a real pain<br/>\nas the Freeport bound boat no longer stops there.  I have also zoned in and<br/>\nfound myself on the bottom of the world.  There was no escape from this<br/>\nsituation, so I had to wait for a guide to show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLavastorm hasn&#39;t dropped me in Lava yet, but I have zoned from Najena into<br/>\nOOT.  That was truly bizarre, especially since I was actually headed to<br/>\nButcherblock.  I&#39;ve also zoned out of Najena and appeared in Najena near the<br/>\nTentacle Terror room.

I<br/>\nhave zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>\nabout rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I also had an odd<br/>\noccurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and had a couple<br/>\nguards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several times.  When I<br/>\nfinally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather than by the<br/>\nzone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from Oasis and dropping<br/>\nin near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRylos Darmadrigal Bard of the 21st (almost 22nd) chorus on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n1.6 Million Digital Images!  <br/>\nDownload one Today from Corbis.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3356/7/_/451022/_/955654837/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3356/7/_/451022/_/955654837/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
